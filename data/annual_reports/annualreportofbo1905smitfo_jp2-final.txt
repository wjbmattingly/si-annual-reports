PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS FOR THE YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1905.

Ata meeting held March 12, 19038, the Board of Regents adopted
the following resolution:

Resolved, That, in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the fourth Wednes-
day in January, regular meetings of the Board shall be held on the Tuesday after
the first Monday in December and on the 6th day of March, unless that day falls on
Sunday, when the following Monday shall be substituted.

In accordance with this resolution, the Board met at 10 o’clock a. m.
on December 6, 1904, January 25, 1905, and March 6, 1905.

REGULAR MEETING OF DECEMBER 6, 1904.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller (Chancellor) in the chair; the
Hon. W. P. Frye, President pro tempore of the Senate, acting as
Regent; the Hon. S. M. Cullom, the Hon. O. H. Platt, the Hon. F. M.
Cockrell, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the Hon. Hugh. A. Dinsmore,
Dr. Andrew D. White, the Hon. John B. Henderson, Dr. A. Graham
Bell, and the Secretary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING.

The minutes of the meeting held March 7, 1904, were read in
abstract and approved. ; ;

DISPOSITION OF THE REMAINS OF JAMES SMITHSON.

The Secretary stated that at the meeting of January 27, 1904, a com-
mittee consisting of the Chancellor, the members of the executive com-
mittee, and the Secretary had been appointed to act on the question
of the final disposition of the remains of James Smithson and of the
monument to be erected to him. The committee reported to the Board
on March 7, 1904, recommending that a suitable tomb be erected and
that Congress be asked to make an adequate appropriation for it.

- Since that meeting the committee had decided to suggest in lieu of
their former recommendation that the original tomb be brought to this
country and used as a final resting place for the remains. Accordingly
the Secretary had entered into correspondence with the ofticials at
Genoa, and the tomb had been shipped and was expected by the end

of the present month.
XI
XII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

After discussion, Senator Cullom offered the following resolution,
which was adopted:

Resolved, That the special committee having in charge the matter of the final dis-
position of the remains of James Smithson be authorized to receive the original
tomb, and to place it, suitably inscribed, with the remains, in some proper position
that they may select in the grounds of ihe Institution; the expenses involved in the
matter to be met from the funds of the Institution.

NEW BUILDING FOR THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Secretary stated that the preliminary floor plans and elevations
were approved on January 27, 1904, and that the detailed plans for the
construction of the foundation had been worked out during the spring.
The excavation for the building was begun on June 15, 1904, the Secre-
tary turning the first spade of earth, and the site of the building was
inclosed with a high board fence. The excavation was completed dur-
ing the last of the summer, and the work of laying the foundation was”
immediately begun, the material used being concrete. This part of the
work was finished November 9, 1904.

Proposals for furnishing the granite for all parts of the building
where this stone was to be used, were opened October 1. There were
nine bidders, and after due consideration the following selections were
made: For the basement story, pink granite from Milford, Mass.; for
the main and second stories, the white Bethel granite of Vermont;
for the upper story, white granite from Mount Airy, N. C.; for the
trimmings of the court walls, the so-called Woodstock granite of Mary-
land. It was explained that the stones from these quarries would
harmonize, and that the selection had the favorable recommendation
of the superintendent of construction and of the architects.

Contracts were at once entered into for supplying the above mate-
rial, cut and ready for laying, and it was gratifying to state that the
total cost of the granite would fall below the original estimates.

It was expected that work on the lower story could be started by
next February, and in case the season were an open one, the basement
walls could be completed before the summer of 1905. At the present
time the superintendent of construction was erecting, in wood, a nar-
row section of the south front of the building, of actual dimensions,
in order to determine if the lines and proportions as shown on the
plans were entirely satisfactory or subject to improvement.

PRESERVATION OF ANTIQUITIES.

The Secretary recalled to the Board that bills for the preservation
of antiquities on the national domain, had been introduced in the Sen-
ate by Senator Cullom, and in the House by Representative Hitt, at
the last session of Congress, but that no action had been taken. It
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

had been learned that the Secretary of the Interior had in contempla-
tion a bill which, while meeting the needs of the Department, would
also be satisfactory to the Institution. The Institution had undertaken
to prepare for the Secretary of the Interior the requisite maps giving
the location of antiquities on the public lands. It was of interest to
state that the Secretary of the Interier had already taken preliminary
steps in the matter, so far as his authority extended, and had appointed
guardians for important ruins.

EXPLORATIONS.

The Secretary said that since the last meeting of the Board two
expeditions had ben sent out by the Institution; one under the direc-
tion of Mr. A. G. Maddren for the purpose of studying the remains
of the Alaskan mammoth and other large mammals reported as abun-
dant in the ‘‘ Bone-Yard” and at Elephant Point; and a second under
the direction of Dr. W. H. Sherzer to study the glaciers of British
Columbia. Arrangements had also been made to send Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes to Vera Cruz, Mexico, for the purpose of studying the prac-
tically unexplored region in the eastern shore of that country, where
it is hoped to discover the relationship of the mound-building tribes
of our Mississippi Valley and the Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande
and Rio Colorado with the so-called civilized tribes of Mexico. . The
district was also interesting because of the presence there of a branch
of the Maya race of Yucatan.

The sending of these expeditions was a recurrence tc the old policy
of the Institution which paid for them from its own fund. In this
last case it was a joint work of the Bureau of American Ethnology
and the Institution.

EXTENSION OF ETHNOLOGICAL WORK IN HAWAII AND SAMOA.

The Secretary explained that he had for several years, in connection
with the estimates, urged the extension of the researches of the Bureau
of American Ethnology to Hawaiiand Samoa. Congress had apparently
been unwilling up to the present time to authorize this. These
researches were practically urgent, and the request had been renewed
this year, and he hoped that its importance could be impressed upon
the members of the appropriations committees. No additional
appropriation was needed to accomplish this, it being only necessary
to insert the proper phraseology in the appropriation bill.

The Board then adjourned.

bequest at some future time.

On motion the report was accepted and ordered filed.

REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE FINAL DISPOSITION OF
THE REMAINS OF JAMES SMITHSON.

The Chancellor, as chairman of the committee, reported as follows:

At a meeting on December 6, 1904, the Board of Regents adopted the following
resolution:

** Resolved, That the special committee, having in charge the matter of the final
disposition of the remains of James Smithson, be authorize: to receive the original
tomb and to place it, suitably inseribed, with the remains, in some proper position
that they may select in the grounds of the Institution; the expenses involved in the
matter to be met from the funds of the Institution.”

Your committee haying directed the shipping of the tomb to this country, it
arrived in the port of New York and has just been brought on here. It is tempora-
rily set up near the Institution. It is a most modest structure, but sufficient in its
place in a cemetery surrounded by other tombs. Your committee would like to
have the Regents see it before they place it permanently in any conspicuous exter-
nal position. Should the Regents please to authorize the committee to place it
within the Institution, at least temporarily, they will find a place for it.

After realizing the insufficiency of the tomb for an external site, your committee
have some hesitation in choosing a place for it in the open grounds of the Institution
under the terms of the resolution, but would probably place it immediately north
of the present building. Your committee feel that in that case, some accessory
would be necessary.

The adoption of this report will be considered by the committee as authorizing
them to place the tomb and remains within the Institution, at least temporarily.

Repectfully submitted.

MELVILLE W.- FULLER, Chairman.

On motion the report was adopted.

FREER COLLECTION.

The Secretary said that during the early part of the year 1904 he
bad had an interview at the Institution with Mr. Charles L. Freer, of
Detroit, who was desirous of giving his valuable collection of objects
of American and oriental art to the Smithsonian Institution or to the
United States Government on certain conditions. Mr. Freer had
outlined orally the extent of the collection, its cost, and the conditions
under which he proposed to make the offer.

The Secretary had brought the matter before the executive com-
mittee, and he read a letter which he had sent to Mr. Freer reciting
his understanding of the collection and conditions of gift, and which,
further, contained the following action of the committee:

The executive committee, haying heard with interest and apprecia‘icn the state-
ment by Secretary Langley of the proposition and views of Mr. Charles L. Freer,

sm 1905——2
XVI PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

of Detroit, to intrust to the Smithsonian Institution a collection of works of art,
now in his possession, which has already cost $600,000 and to which he proposes
to add almost as much more and to construct for housing it a hall costing $500,000,
upon condition that all the expense and responsibility for its care and mainte-
nance shall be provided, are of the opinion that it would be well for the Board of
Regents to consider such a proposition in sympathy with the broad and cultivated
spirit in which it is made; but as it is presented only as a statement of a conversa-
tion with Mr. Freer, it is requested by the committee that Secretary Langley com-
muniecate with Mr. Freer and suggest to him that he put in more precise form his
views and his wishes, so that the action which the committee may recommend to
the Board shall be such as will exactly set forth Mr. Freer’s purposes and be given
the careful consideration appropriate to such an enduring benefaction.

To this letter the following reply was received:

Derrorr, Micu., December 27, 1904.
S. P. Laneiey, Esq.,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.:
Dear Str: In replying to your kind letter of the 16th instant, and in further
reference to the conversation had with you on March 24 last, I beg to say that my
permanent collections consist of the following art objects, namely:

By James McNerLit WHISTLER:
100 framed paintings in oil, water-color, and pastel.
60 unframed drawings in pencil and water color.
150 lithographs.
575 etchings.
The entire decorations of the Peacock Room.

By D. W. Tryon, T. W. Dewrne, and A. H. THAyeEr:
50 framed paintings in oil, water-color, and pastel.

By various masters of Chinese and Japanese schools of painting, beginning with the
tenth century and ending with the nineteenth century, including specimens by
Ririomin, Sesshiu, Sesson, Motonobu, Tanyu, Koyetsu, Sotatsu, Korin, Kenzan,
Hoitsu, Okio, Hokusai, and various other masters:

400 kakemono, many of which are in pairs.
80 screens, many of which are in pairs.
30 panels.

By various potters of the Far East and Central Asia, including Chinese, Japanese,

Coreans, Persians, Arabians, and others as yet unidentified:
950 pieces of pottery.

Also a small group of ancient Chinese and Japanese bronzes, a few early Japanese

and Corean wood-carvings, and some lacquer by Koyetsu, Korin, and Ritsuwo.

These several collections include specimens of very widely separated periods of
artistic development, beginning before the birth of Christ and ending to-day.

No attempt has been made to secure specimens from unsympathetic sources, my
collecting haying been confined to American and Asiatic schools. My great desire
has been to unite modern work with masterpieces of certain periods of high civiliza-
tion, harmonious in spiritual and physical suggestion, having the power to broaden
esthetic culture and the grace to elevate the human mind.

These collections I desire to retain during my life for the enjoyment of students,
my friends, and myself, and for the further purpose of making additions and improve-
ments from time to time. Believing that good models only should be used in
artistic construction, I wish to continue my censorship, aided by the best expert

advice, and remove every undesirable article, and add in the future whatever I can
obtain of like harmonious standard quality.

I now repeat my offer to bequeath these collections to the Smithsonian Institution,
or to the United States Government, and also the sum of $500,000 in money jor the
purpose of constructing a suitable building in which to house them, upon the follow-
ing terms and conditions:

First. The sum of $500,000 shall be paid by my executors to the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution or the United States Government promptly after my decease,
and shall be used forthwith for the construction of a fireproof building connected
with the National Museum, the construction of which has recently been authorized,
or reasonably near thereto.

Second. The interior of this building shall be arranged with special regard for the
convenience of students and others desirous of an opportunity for uninterrupted
study. A suitable space shall be provided in which the Peacock Room shall be
reerected complete. The whole interior arrangement of the building shall be agreed
upon between the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution and myself within a
reasonable time after the acceptance of this offer.

Third. The collections, with such changes and additions thereto as shall be made
during my lifetime, shall be delivered by my executors to the Regents immediately
after the building is constructed and ready to receive them.

Fourth. The collections and the buildings shall be cared for and maintained per-
petually by the Smithsonian Institution or the United States Government at its own
expense.

Fifth. No addition or deduction shall be made to the collections after my death,
and nothing else shall ever be exhibited with them, or in the same building, nor
shall the said collections, or any part thereof, be removed at any timesfrom the said
building except when necessary for the purpose of making repairs or renovations in
the building.

Sixth. No charge shall ever be made for admission to the building or for the privi-
lege of examining or studying the collections.

Seventh. The collections and building shall always bear my name in some modest
and appropriate form.

In lieu of the foregoing offer I am willing, upon the conditions above expressed,
to make a present conveyance of the title to said collections to the Institution or the
Government, and a bequest of the sum of $500,000 for the building, provided:

1. The collections shall remain in my possession during my life, and in the possession
of my executors after my death until the completion of the building.

2. I shall have the right to make such changes in the collections, by disposing of
any part thereof, or by adding thereto, as may seem to me advisable or necessary
for the improvement of the collections, or any of them.

3. Both I and my executors shall be free from any liability on account of any loss
in or damage that may accrue to the collections while in my or their charge, even
though such loss or injury shall occur by reason of my or their negligence, or the
negligence of my or their servants, agents, or employees. -

The exact form of the bequest or gift and the details for carrying it into execution
are legal questions that can be agreed upon by counsel representing the Institution
or the Government and myself.

I suggest that the Institution or the Government, before coming to a decision
regarding the above offer, send a committee of experts to Detroit to make an exami-
nation of the collections. It will be a source of satisfaction to me to exhibit the col-
lections to such a committee, and the report it may make will be of great value to
the Institution or Government in reaching a conclusion. I remain, with great
respect,

Very truly, yours, CHARLES L. FREER.
SOWIE PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

After conference with the chairman of the executive committee the
Secretary addressed Mr. Freer, asking if he could see his way to
modify the requirements of the fifth clause of his conditions, to
which a reply was received that after serious consideration no modifi-
eation could be made in the terms of the clause referred to.

A very general discussion arose as to the matters involved under
the terms of the proposed donation, the prevailing opinion being that
more information was necessary before the Board could come to a
conclusion. It was pointed out that Mr. Freer had asked that a com-
mittee visit him for the purpose of seeing the collectian, and the
Board decided to accept the suggestion. The following resolution
was accordingly adopted:

Resolved, That the Chancellor appoint a committee of three Regents, whose duty
it shall be to make personal examination of the collection of art objects which Mr.
Charles L. Freer has proposed to give or bequeath to the Smithsonian Institution,
and make report to the Board of its value and merits, and said committee is further
instructed to ascertain from Mr. Freer what alterations, if any, can be made in the
conditions of his very generous proposal; and the Secretary of this Institution is
hereby added as an additional member of this committee.

The Chancellor appointed Doctor Angell, Senator Henderson, Doe-
tor Bell, and the Secretary as the committee.

The Board then adjourned.

REGULAR MEETING OF MARCH 6, 1905.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller (Chancellor) in the chair; the Hon.
Charles W. Fairbanks, Vice-President of the United States; the Hon.
O. H. Platt, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the Hon. Hugh A. Dinsmore,
the Hon. Andrew D. White, the Hon. John B. Henderson, Dr. A.
Graham Bell, and the Secretary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING.

The minutes of the meeting held January 25, 1905, were read-in
abstract and approved.

APPOINTMENT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

The Secretary, after stating the necessity for the appointment of an
additional assistant secretary of the Institution, asked the Board’s
approval of his selection of Dr. Cyrus Adler, the present Librarian of
the Institution, for the position, adding an explanatory statement as
to Doctor Adler’s fitness for the duties.

Senator Henderson followed with further commendatory remarks,
and presented the subjoined resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Dr. Cyrus Adler as Assistant

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the Library and the Exchanges,
with such additional duties as the Secretary may assign him, be approved.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIX
FREER COLLECTION.

Senator Henderson, in the absence of Doctor Angell, Chairman,
and on behalf of the committee appointed to visit Detroit and inspect
the art collection of Mr. Charles L. Freer, presented a report, which
was very fully discussed; and as it was deemed best that the matter
should be considered at a subsequent meeting of the Board, at which
a fuller attendance might be expected, Senator Platt offered the fol-
lowing resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents take this occasion to express their sincere
thanks to Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, for the courtesy shown to the committee
of the Regents which recently visited Detroit to examine his art collection; and that

further consideration of his generous offer to donate the same to this Institution or
the United States be continued until the next meeting of the Board of Regents.

GIFT OF BOTANICAL COLLECTION.

The Secretary stated that Capt. John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore,
had donated to the Institution his entire botanical collection, compris-
ing 100,000 plants and nearly 1,600 books on botany. There were no
conditions, except that the donor reserved the right to continue to
work upon the collection.

Doctor White offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents be tendered to Capt. John

Donnell Smith for his generosity in presenting to the Institution his large and yal-
uable collection of plants and books on botany, which is gratefully accepted.

FINAL DISPOSITION OF SMITHSON’S REMAINS.

The Secretary reviewed the report presented to the Board at the
meeting of January 25 by the committee charged with the final dis-
position of Smithson’s remains, and said that he hoped that at some
future time Congress would make an adequate appropriation for giving
these remains a fitting interment; but that so far as he had been able
he had given present effect to the mandate of the Board by depositing
them temporarily within the building in a small room which he had
had fitted up on the immediate left of the north entrance to the
building.

The remains had been examined by medical experts and found to be
in aremarkable state of preservation. They had now been put in a
suitable casket and were ready to be transferred to the tomb, and he
would ask the Regents, when the meeting had adjourned, to proceed
to the room and witness the deposit of the casket.

After remarks on the condition of the work of the Institution, the
Board adjourned, and the Regents repaired to the room referred to,
where, in their presence, the casket was placed within the tomb, which:
was then sealed.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. XXIII

Early in June, 1905, the Accountant of the Institution, W. W. Karr,
whose duties also Seer ‘ed the handling of its revenues, was found to
be a defaulter. Instead of there being a credit balance of $46,648.33
on June 30, 1904, as shown by the books of the accountant, there was
in fact a deficiency of $362.80.

The subject of this deficiency is dealt with in detail in a special
report communicated by the Secretary to the executive committee, and
which the executive committee now submits to the Board of Regents
with its approval. It seems proper in this place to make a general
résumé showing the items of the deficiency and in what manner it was
perpetrated.

On July 13, 1891, a check was drawn for a semimonthly pay roll
amounting to $494.57. After the voucher for the pay roll had been
approved for this amount and the check corresponding to the voucher
had been signed, Karr raised this check from $494.57 to $5,494.57,
appropriating the difference, $5,000, to himself. This was the first
transgression which was ascertained.

Between July, 1891, and May 31, 1905, there was received as income
by the Institution $1,146,051.32, and actually deposited in the Treasury
$1,087,184.19, leaving a difference of $58,867.13, which should have
been to the credit of the Institution, but which represents the embez-
zlement by Karr from the receipts of the Institution proper.

In addition to this, Karr embezzled from the Congressional appro-
priation for the U. S. National Museum for the fiscal year 1904—5 the
sum of $7,400, which amount has been repaid to the Government by
the bonding company which had given bond to the Government for
his fidelity. In further addition thereto, Karr abstracted from funds
received by the Institution for the International Catalogue of Scien-
tific Literature, at London, $4,691.48.“

To recapitulate, the actual losses through Karr’s embezzlements
were as follows:

Moneys received for the Smithsonian Institution aud converted to his

The executive committee in 1891, when these defalcations began,
consisted of James C. Welling, Henry Coppée, and Gen. M. C. Meigs.

duration, Bey ing heed immediately transformed into a Unkle by eae

deposit of the semiannual interest funds, the fact that there had been
peculations from the Institution was not discovered until June, 1905,
when the Institution was informed that its account wasoverdrawn. As
the end of the fiscal year was drawing near, it was found necessary to
borrow the sum of $10,000 to meet current obligations. The loan
was paid on July 5, 1905, or as soon as collections would permit.
Owing to the condition in which the books and accounts were left by -
the late accountant, it is impossible to state in their respective classes
the amounts of the miscellaneous receipts. The total of such receipts
deposited in the Treasury during the year was in the aggregate
$6,861.72, as given in the foregoing statement.

Your committee also presents the following statements in regard to
appropriations and expenditures for objects intrusted by Congress to
the care of the Smithsonian Institution:

gress for that fiscal year, or involve the Government in any contract
LIV ACTS AND RESOLUTION OF CONGRESS.

or obligation for the future payment of money in excess of such
appropriations unless such contract or obligation is authorized by law.
Nor shall any Department or officer of the Government accept volun-
tary service for the Government or employ personal service in excess
of that authorized by law, except in cases of sudden emergency involy-
ing the loss of human life or the destruction of property. All appro-
priations made for contingent expenses or other general purposes,
except appropriations made for the fulfilment of contract obligations
expressly authorized by law, or for objects required or authorized by
law without reference to the amounts annually appropriated therefor,
shall, on or before the beginning of each fiscal year, be so apportioned
by monthly or other allotments as to prevent undue expenditures in
one portion of the year that may require deficiency or additional
appropriations to complete the service of the fiscal year; and all such
apportionments shall be adhered to except when waived or modified
in specific cases by the written order of the head of the Executive
Department or other Government establishment having control of the
expenditure, but this provision shall not apply to the contingent
appropriations of the Senate or House of Representatives; and all
such waivers or modifications, together with the reasons therefor,
shall be communicated to Congress in connection with estimates for
any additional appropriations required on account thereof. Any
person violating any provision of this section shall be summarily
removed from office and may also be punished by a fine of not less
than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not less than one
month.” (Approved March 3, 1905; Statutes, X X XIII, 1257.)

RESTRICTIONS ON PRINTING, BINDING, AND ILLUSTRATIONS.

And no more than an allotment of one-half of the sum hereby appro-
priated shall be expended in the first two quarters of the fiscal year,
and no more than one-fourth thereof may be expended in either of the
last two quarters of the fiscal year, except that, in addition thereto, in
either of said last quarters, the unexpended balances of allotments for
preceding quarters may be expended: * * * Provided further,
That hereafter no part of the appropriations made for printing and
binding shall be used for any illustration, engraving, or photograph
in any document or report ordered printed by Congress unless the
order to print expressly authorizes the same, nor in any document or
report of any Executive Department or other Government establish-
ment until the head of the Executive Department or Government

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE

YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1905.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith my report,
showing the operations of the Institution during the year ending
June 30, 1905, including the work placed under its direction by Con-
gress in the United States National Museum, the Bureau of American
Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National Zoological
Park, and the Astrophysical Observatory.

Following the precedent of several years, there is given, in the
body of this report, a general account of the affairs of the Institution
and its bureaus, while the Appendix presents more detailed state-
ments by the persons in direct charge of the different branches ot
the work. Independently of this, the operations of the National
Museum are fully treated in a separate volume of the Smithsonian
Report, and the Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology con-
stitutes a volume prepared under the supervision of the Chief of
that Bureau. The scientific work of the Astrophysical Observatory
is recorded in occasional publications.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

By act of Congress approved August 10, 1846, the Smithsonian
Tnstitution was created an Establishment. Its statutory members are
the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice of the United
States, and the heads of the Executive Departments. The preroga-
{ive of the Establishment is “the supervision of the affairs of the

1

B. Angell, of Michigan; Dr. Andrew D. White, of New York; the
Hon. J. B. Henderson, of Washington City; Prof. A. Graham Bell,
of Washington City; the Hon. Richard Olney, of Massachusetts, and
the Hon. George Gray, of Delaware.

There are two vacancies on the Board, caused by the death of Sena-
tor O. H. Platt and the retirement of Senator Francis M. Cockrell.

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents held March 12, 1903, the fol-
lowing resolution was adopted:

“ Resolved, That in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the
fourth Wednesday in January, regular meetings of the Board shall
be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in December and on
the 6th day of March, unless that date falls on Sunday, when the
following Monday shall be substituted.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

Tn accordance with the above resolution the Board met on Decem-
ber 6, 1904, January 25, 1905, and March 6, 1905.

The following is an abstract of its proceedings, which latter will
be found in the annual report of the Board to Congress:

REGULAR MEETING OF DECEMBER 6, 1904.

A statement concerning the disposition of the remains of James
Smithson, and the report of the special committee having in charge
the final disposition of the remains, was presented to the Board,
which adopted the following resolution:

“ Resolved, That the special committee having in charge the matter
of the final disposition of the remains of James Smithson be author-
ized to receive the original tomb, and to place it, suitably inscribed,
with the remains, in some proper position that they may select in the
grounds of the Institution ; the expenses involved in the matter to
be met from the funds of the Institution.”

The Secretary made a statement to the Board concerning the prog-
ress on the new building for the National Museum. The excavation
for the building was begun on June 15, 1904, and the laying of the
foundations in concrete was finished November 9, 1904. The con-
tracts for the granite had been entered into.

The Secretary recalled to the Board the various bills introduced
for the preservation of antiquities on the national domain. He had
learned in the meantime that the Secretary of the Interior had in
contemplation a bill which would meet the needs of the Department
and be satisfactory to the Institution, which had prepared for the
Secretary of the Interior the requisite maps giving the location of
antiquities on the public lands. The Secretary of the Interior had
also taken preliminary steps for the appointment of guardians for
important ruins.

ANNUAL MEETING, JANUARY 25, 1905.

The Secretary announced the reappointment of Dr. J. B. Angell
as a Regent for six years, by joint. resolution approved by the
President January 19, 1905.

The usual resolution relative to income and expenditure was
adopted, and the annual reports of the Secretary, the executive com-
mittee, and the permanent committee were submitted.

The special committee on the disposition of the remains of James
Smithson reported the arrival of the original tomb, and their decision,
under the authority given at the previous meeting, to place it and the
remains within the Smithsonian building. A statement of the rein-
terment of the remains will be found on a subsequent page.

The Secretary informed the Board of the proposal of Mr. Charles
L. Freer, of Detroit, to bequeath or to make a deed of gift, to take
effect upon his death, of a collection of paintings and etchings, largely
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

those of Whistler and his school, and of American and oriental pot-
tery and other objects of art; and of erecting a building to be used
solely for the purpose of exhibiting these objects, on condition that
the Regents should provide for the maintenance of the building and
collections. The Secretary had laid this matter before the executive
committee under date of December 16, which adopted the following
report:

“The executive committee, having heard with interest and appre-
ciation the statement by Secretary “Langley of the proposition and
views of Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, to intrust to the Smith-
sonian Institution a collection of works of art, now in his possession,
which has already cost $600,000, and to which he proposes to add
almost as much more, and to construct for housing it a hall costing
$500,000, upon condition that all the expense and responsibility for
its care and maintenance shall be provided, are of opinion that it
would be well for the Board of Regents to consider such a proposition
in sympathy with the broad and cultivated spirit in which it is made;
but as it is presented only as a statement of a conversation with Mr.
Freer, it is requested by the committee that Secretary Langley com-
municate with Mr. Freer, and suggest to him that he put in more
precise form his views and his wishes, so that the action which the
committee may recommend to the Board shall be such as will exactly
set forth Mr. Freer’s purposes and be given the careful consideration
appropriate to such an enduring benefaction.

“It is further requested by the committee that Mr. Freer be com-
municated with in such time that his reply may be received and be
considered by the committee before the meeting of the Board, which
occurs on January 25, 1905.”

After reading several communications from Mr. Freer on the
subject, and the correspondence between him and the Secretary, the
following resolution was adopted :

“Resolved, That the Chancellor appoint a committee of three
Regents, whose duty it shall be to make personal examination of the
collection of art objects which Mr. Charles L. Freer has proposed to
give or bequeath to the Smithsonian Institution, and make report to
the Board of its value and merits; and said committee is further
instructed to ascertain from Mr. Freer what alterations, if any, can
be made in the conditions of his very generous proposal; and the Sec-
retary of this Institution is hereby added as an additional member of
this committee.”

The following committee was then appointed: Doctor Angell,
Senator Henderson, Doctor Bell, and the Secretary

REGULAR MEETING OF MARCH 6, 1905.

The Secretary asked the Board’s approval of his appointment of
Dr. Cyrus Adler as Assistant Secretary of the Institution, and the
following resolution was adopted:

“Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Dr. Cyrus
Adler as Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

charge of the Library and the Exchanges, with such additional duties
as the Secretary may assign him, be approved.”

In the absence of Doctor Angell, chairman of the special commit-
tee, Senator Henderson presented a report giving an account of the
visit of the committee to Detroit and their conference with Mr.
Freer. The report was fully discussed, and the following resolution
was adopted :

“Resolved, That the Board of Regents take this occasion to express
their sincere thanks to Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, for the cour-
tesy shown to the committse of the Regents which recently visited
Detroit to examine his art collection; and that further consideration
of his generous offer to donate the same to this Institution or the
United States be continued until the next meeting of the Board of
Regents.”

The Secretary stated that Capt. John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore,
had donated to the Institution his entire botanical collection, and the
Board adopted the following resolution:

“Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents be tendered
to Capt. John Donnell Smith for his generosity in presenting to the
Institution his large and valuable collection of plants and books on
botany, which is gratefully accepted.”

The Secretary stated that a room in the Smithsonian building had
been fitted up as a temporary resting place for the remains of Smith-
son, and asked the Regents to be present at their transfer.

After adjournment, the Regents repaired to the room referred to,
where, in their presence, the remains were placed within the tomb,
which was then sealed.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Sixty years ago, when Joseph Henry became the first Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution, the scope of the work he assumed was
practically unlimited; Smithson’s direction being that his bequest
was to be used for the “increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.” After considering many suggestions as to how this might best
be done, Professor Henry decided that the proper function of the
Smithsonian Institution was “to assist men of science in making
original researches, to publish them in a series of volumes, and to give
a copy of them to every first-class brary on the face of the earth.”
This has remained the policy of the Institution; and although its
operations have, of necessity, been modified from time to time, its
original breadth of scope has never been narrowed.

The methods of assisting in original research have been various.
Numerous grants have been made to qualified investigators, and
xpeditions have been sent out in many directions. Several enter-
prises undertaken by the Institution on a small scale outgrew the
original intention and, in accordance with the policy of the Institution
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

not to carry on work that could be done elsewhere, have been allowed
to establish themselves independently, chief among which are the
United States Weather Bureau, the Geological Survey, and the Fish
Commission. Other establishments, as the National Museum,, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchanges, and
the National Zoological Park, have continued under the direction of
the Institution. It led the way in the organization of brary work in
the United States; it took the initial steps and continues to support
schemes for international cataloguing, and it maintains a benevolent
relation with the American Historical Association and the National
Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The results of all important investigations and the operations
of the Institution and its dependencies are reported upon constantly.
Its publications, which include more than 250 volumes, are to be
found in all the important libraries of the world, and some of them
on the work table of every scientific student. Through the agency of
the International Exchange System, these works, together with other
public documents and learned treatises, are distributed throughout the
civilized world, and the foreign works received in exchange are
invaluable in American scientific lbraries.

Thus the Smithsonian Institution is in constant association with
the Government and all the public institutions of the United States.
To them the Institution holds out a friendly cooperation, its aim
being, while continuing its own work upon its accepted lines and
adapting them to new needs as occasion arises, to continue along the
established policy of preventing rivalries, promoting wise cooper-
ation, diminishing waste, and furthering the search for knowledge,
the recording of discovered truth, and its dissemination among the
people.

In this great work the individual is not lost sight of; the publi-
cations of the Institution are widely distributed, its library constitutes
an important part of the Library of Congress, and its museum is the
rarest in existence in many branches of the natural history and eth-
nology of the New World. Less imposing than these methods of
serving the public, but no less important, is the satisfaction of a con-
stant stream of inquirers, whose letters from every corner of the
country bring questions bearing on every branch of knowledge.

BUILDINGS.

The only important building operation carried on during the past
year, of course excepting the work on the new Museum building, was
the construction of a mortuary chapel to contain the tomb of James
Smithson, brought from Italy.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. fe

When the San Benigno Cemetery at Genoa was expropriated for
municipal purposes by the Italian Government in 1903, the Regents
determined to bring the remains of James Smithson to Washington.
Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the committee appointed for this pur-
pose, was successful in his mission, and on January 25, 1904, formally
gave the remains into the hands of the Regents. Doctor Bell’s report
and an account of the ceremonies incident to the removal and recep-
tion of the remains were published in the Annual Report for 1904.

The body, upon its arrival in Washington, was placed temporarily in
a room in the Smithsonian building containing the relics of Smithson.
While resting there, the remains were examined by medical experts
and found to be in a remarkable state of preservation. Meanwhile,
a small mortuary chapel was prepared for them on the immediate
left of the north entrance of the Smithsonian building, and on March
6, 1905, the remains were carried to this chapel and, in the presence of
the Regents, replaced in the original tomb, recently brought from
Genoa (plates 1, m1), where they will rest until Congress makes
adequate provision for their interment.

Work on the reconstruction on the large archeological hall in the
main Smithsonian building has continued throughout the year, as
has the process of repairing various portions of the roof of the Mu-
seum, including the re-covering of the central rotunda. Some time
has also been spent in going through the subcellar of the Museum
building removing dead wires, whitewashing, and otherwise improy-
ing its condition.

FINANCES.

tain approved railroad bonds which form part of the fund established
by Mr. Hodgkins.

At the beginning of the fiscal year July 1, 1904, there was a
deficit of $362.80 instead of a credit balance of $46,648.33, as stated
in my report for the year ended June 30, 1904. On June 2, 1905, it
was discovered that the accountant of the Institution was a defaulter,
and that by the aid of false entries and erasures he had been able to
conceal his misdeeds from detection. He was immediately placed in
the custody of the law and an examination of the books and accounts
was commenced, but the total amount of the defaleation had not been
determined at the close of the fiscal year, and a more complete
statement will be submitted in a special report.

During the year the total receipts deposited in the Treasury of the
United States in behalf of the Institution were $74,761.72. Of this
sum $57,060 were derived from interest, $10,000 from a temporary
loan, and the balance of $7,701.72 from miscellaneous sources. The
disbursements during the year amounted to $69,245, the details of
which are given in the report of the executive committee. The
balance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1905,
for the expenses of the Institution, was $5,153.92.

During the fiscal year 1905 the Institution was charged by Con-
gress with the disbursement of the following appropriations:

RESEARCHES.

In accordance with the original plan of the Institution that its
Secretary should devote his time to scientific matters as well as
administrative,* research work in various fields has been continued
under my direction by the Institution and its dependencies.

In the Astrophysical Observatory I have continued work believed
to be important, and inaugurated some experiments of novel interest,
which are referred to later.

Through the Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology
the Institution has been enabled to carry on various biological,
geological, and ethnological researches, which will be found fully
described elsewhere in this report.

HODGKINS FUND.

Frequent applications for grants from the Hodgkins fund are
received; and while, as noted in previous reports, the conditions
establishing the foundation are such as to measurably restrict the
scope of its activities, all requests for aid are carefully considered
and acted on. In addition to the researches here mentioned, reports
on several interesting investigations, already noted as in progress,
are still awaited and will be published later.

A grant has been approved on behalf of Mr. A. L. Rotch, of Blue
Hill Meteorological Observatory, whose investigations of the upper

and present such facts and principles as may be developed for publication in
the Smithsonian contributions. (Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents,

10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

air currents by means of kites have been aided by the Hodgkins
fund. Mr. Rotch conducted a series of experiments at the St. Louis
Exposition with ballons-sondes, which carry instruments only, these
recording automatically the temperature and pressure of the air,
the duration of flight and the place of landing, indicating also the
velocity and direction of the air currents traversed. The success of
these first experiments in America with recording balloons was such
as to warrant their continuance under the same direction, and on
their termination the results will be embodied in a report by Mr.
Rotch for publication by the Institution.

A paper on the Construction of a Vowel Organ, by Dr. E. W.
Scripture, has been recently published by the Institution. This arti-
cle gives the details of work under a Hodgkins grant approved for
the purpose and mentioned in my last report.

Tn extending his researches in connection with speech or phonetics
Doctor Scripture has been fortunate in securing individual gramo-
phone voice records of much historical interest. A voice record of
the Emperor of Germany was transmitted by Doctor Scripture in
January, 1905, for preservation in the United States National Mu-
seum. This record gives, in about two hundred words, the Emperor’s
conception of the aims and beauty of true manhood and of man’s
duty to his fellow, and recognizes the wisdom of the Almighty and
Omniscient Creator. At present only one other record of His Maj-
esty’s voice exists, namely, one made at the same time for preserva-
tion in the hbrary of Harvard University.

The experiments conducted by Mr. Alexander Larsen, of Chicago,
in connection with the photography of lghtning flashes, with a
special effort to measure their duration, mentioned in my last report
as having been aided by a limited grant from the Hodgkins fund,
have been continued during the year and the results carefully re-
ported. An interesting research on the fluorescence of minerals has
also been carried on by Mr. Larsen, more than 100 specimens, sent for
the purpose by the Institution, having been examined and reported
on. During these experiments many interesting facts have been
noted, which may prove the basis of further investigation.

A moderate additional grant has been approved during the year
on behalf of Doctor von Lendenfeld, of the K. K. Zoologisches Insti-
tute, Prague, to assist in defraying the cost of the construction of an
improved apparatus for taking the serial instantaneous photographs
required for studies of the flight organs of animals. Doctor von
Lendenfeld has given serious and protracted attention to this subject,
in connection with which numerous articles prepared by him, or
under his direction, have been published. A paper by Doctor Mascha,
supervised by Doctor von Lendenfeld, on “ The Structure of Wing-
Feathers,” has recently been printed in the Smithsonian Miscella-

appeared in the Smithsonian Report for 1904. |

In May, 1905, a grant was approved on behalf of Prof. W. P. Brad-
ley, of Wesleyan University, for an experimental investigation of the
expansion of air through a nozzle. As all practical forms of appa-
ratus for the production of liquid air depend, so far, upon this type of
expansion, the research is deemed an important one, the more so from
the fact that the theory of the nozzle expansion of gases is in dispute
and must apparently remain so until more complete data are secured.

The results of previous experiments in the liquefaction of air, car-
ried on by Professor Bradley at Wesleyan University, show conclu-
sively that he is in an exceptionally favorable position for the direc-
tion of an extended inquiry into the factors which make for efficiency
in such a research, and as it is expected that further investigation
will materially aid a decision as to certain questions concerning which
experimentalists are not fully agreed, the report to be submitted by
Professor Bradley is awaited with interest.

Early in the year 1904 a third grant was approved on behalf of
Dr. Carl Barus to aid in preparing the completed report of his
recent research for publication. This memoir, “A Continuous Record
of Atmospheric Nucleation,” is in press, as one of the Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge, and will be the third and last volume of
the series giving a detailed account of the investigation of Doctor
Barus. <A request that a summary of the work should be prepared by
the author for presentation before the first international congress on
ionization and radioactivity at Liége in September, 1905, was ap-
proved, thus enabling an investigation on a subject of much immedi-
ate interest, prosecuted under the auspices of the Institution, to be
brought to the attention of this notable gathering.

The subscription to the Journal of Terrestrial Magnetism and
Atmospheric Electricity has been renewed for the present year, with
the understanding that the publication will be maintained in the
future without such aid, a stipulated number of copies being for-
warded this year, as heretofore, to addresses designated by the Insti-
tution.

Among the miscellaneous investigations aided by the Institution
during the year I may mention that Dr. Edward L. Greene, asso-
ciate in botany, United States National Museum, has undertaken to
prepare for publication by the Smithsonian Institution a monograph
to be entitled “ Landmarks of Botanical History.” Doctor Greene
expects to complete this work in two years. Dr. Albert M. Reese,
of Syracuse University, received a small grant to assist him in his
1b REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

work of collecting in Florida the materials for the study of the em-
bryology of the alligator, and in subsequent investigations. Mr.
W. A. Bentley, of Jericho, Vt., has from time to time made numer-
ous photographs of snow crystals and has recently turned over to the
Institution 500 glass positives of his best and most interesting photo-
graphs, together with a descriptive paper relating to them.

NAPLES TABLE.

The Smithsonian seat in the Naples Zoological Station has been
continuously occupied for the greater part of the present year and,
as heretofore, the reports submitted at the close of appointments
mention the exceptional opportunities for special research afforded
at Naples.

To avoid the confusion and inconvenience likely to result from the
duplication of appointments, Doctor Dohrn has recently made a
request that two students should not be assigned to Naples at the same
period without previous consultation with the management of the
station. In order, therefore, to meet the wishes of the always
courteous and accommodating director, it is desirable that those wish-
ing to occupy the Smithsonian seat should enter their applications
as long a time as possible in advance of the period decided on. This
will permit the necessary correspondence in regard to each appoint-
ment, when, as is not infrequently the case, there are more applicants
than can be readily provided for, and will perhaps also at times
afford the opportunity for the extra occupation of an unassigned seat.

It may be added that appointments covering twelve months of the
year 30, 1905, to June 30, 1906—have already been approved,
but as two students are to be received during the same period for one
limited appointment, it may be possible to approve additional brief
sessions during the year. As before announced, applications for the
ensuing year may be taken up for consideration at any time within
six months of the period desired.

The appointment of Prof. J. B. Johnston, of the Uae of
West Virginia, terminated March 1, 1905. While at Naples Doctor
Johnston obtained and prepared a large amount of .material for
future experiment and study. Being an experienced teacher, he
hopes to embody the results so far secured in a more complete and
exact account of the brain, which will be incorporated in a text-book
on The Nervous System of Vertebrates, now in course of preparation.

In April Doctor Johnston was succeeded at the station by Dr.
Stewart Paton, a former member of the teaching staff of Johns Hop-
kins University, on whose behalf a second appointment of six months
from November 1, 1905, has since been approved. A previous inves-
tigation to determine the time when the first spontaneous movements
and definite reactions to external stimulation occur in the embryo

will be continued by Doctor Paton, who will investigate also the
correlative structural changes in the central nervous system that ac-
company these functional developments, and will endeavor to deter-
mine the elements which conduct the nervous impulses.

I am glad to state that the advisory committee continues the same,
and to record my appreciation of the helpful action of the members
in recommendations as to appointments to the Smithsonian seat.

EXPLORATIONS.
ARCHEOLOGY OF GULF STATES OF MEXICO.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, a member of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, has carried on an extended archeological reconnoissance for
the Smithsonian Institution in the Gulf States of Mexico. His trip
was successful, adding information to what 1s known of the prehis-
toric inhabitants of this rich but only partially explored region.
While the main object of this visit was the increase of our knowledge
of Mexican archeology, attention was incidentally given to the strik-
ing likeness of many prehistoric objects observed to those from the
United States and its bearing on the question of culture migrations.
An area was shown in each of the States of Vera Cruz and Tamauli-
pas, as typical of the prehistoric culture of this region, one of these
extending from Xalapa, capital of Vera Cruz, to the Gulf coast, the
other being near the city of Tampico, on the banks of the Panuco and
Tamese rivers.

The numerous ruins or mounds that occur in these areas, rarely
visited by archeologists, are supposed to be typical of the former
culture of two great allied peoples, the Totonacs and Huaxtecs, who
in prehistoric times inhabited the greater part of Vera Cruz and what
is now southern Tamaulipas.

On account of its historical as well as archeological importance,
& visit was made to the little-known ruin of Cempoalan, a Totonac
metropolis visited by Cortés, the conqueror of Mexico. Archeo-
logical literature pertaining to this city is very scanty; there is not
a single description in English of the still well-preserved temples of
this remarkable capital. On his visit to the site of Cempoalan
Doctor Fewkes obtained many fine photographs of the four stately
pyramids and gathered much data regarding their construction. He
also studied and took photographs of the many small objects found
in the neighborhood of the mounds that will later be published. An
attempt to determine the site of another flourishing Totonac city
revealed, near the ancient Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, an important
cluster of earth mounds of considerable size. These were also photo-
graphed and their relics studied.
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Doctor Fewkes visited several large ruins in the neighborhood of
Xalapa, one of which, near Xicochimalco, he has identified as the
remains of the pueblo of Sochimatl, mentioned by Bernal Diaz del
Castillo, historian of the conquest. By this identification new light
is shed on the hitherto obscurely known route of the conquerors from
Cempoalan over the mountains to the plateau of Mexico.

The extensive group of large earth mounds, some of which are
remains of pyramidal temples, situated at Texolo, near Xico, were
also visited, and important material was gathered from them bear-
ing on their prehistoric inhabitants. The numerous ruins in the
vicinity of Tampico were found to be extensive, and objects from
them revealed evidences of a high development of culture. Of the
large Huaxtee pueblo called Chila, subdued by Cortés, nothing now
remains but a group of mounds in an almost impenetrable forest a
few miles from Tamos. Many sites of prehistoric pueblos were
found on the banks of the Panuco; some of these were once temples,
others mortuary hillocks containing pottery offerings and bones of
the dead. Numerous shell heaps occur in this region, some of which
were visited and examined. About a mile from Tampico, Doctor
Fewkes reports, he found a cluster of large earth mounds of con-
siderable extent, up to within a few years concealed by a dense jungle.
The most notable ruins in this region he on the banks of the Cham-
payan lagoon, at the Rancho de San Francisco and Cebadella. In the
Sierra de Palma there is a pyramid having a cut-stone facing and
stairways similar to those in the Totonac region.

THE SMITHSONIAN ALASKAN EXPEDITION.

An expedition to Alaska and adjacent territory was made during
the summer of 1904 by Mr. A. G. Maddren, under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution, for an examination of the Pleistocene
deposits of northern Alaska, in which most of the mammoth and
other vertebrate remains occur. His report treats of these forma-
tions and the criteria by which they are to be distinguished from
the more recent ice and alluvial deposits which have been variously
noticed and discussed by travelers and writers. He says:

The problems of geographic distribution of the animal and vegetable life
of North America in Pleistocene time with the disturbance of faunas and
floras caused by the widespread glaciation during that period and their s=b-
sequent readjustment over the glaciated area all combine to form a complex
arrangement, to solve which will require large collections of specimens from
the Pleistocene deposits of the unglaciated area of Alaska and the adjacent
Canadian territory. At present our knowledge of this fauna and flora is
very limited. As far as we know, only one species of elephant (Hlephas primi-
genius), the mammoth, inhabited Alaska and Siberia during Pleistocene time.

The longest mammoth tusk so far reported from Alaska is one 12 feet 10
inches long, measured on the outside of the curve. Remains of the rhinoceros
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

have not been reported with those of the mammoth in Alaska, as in Siberia, and
it also appears that the remains of the mammoth in Alaska are not in as fresh a
state of preservation as those found in Siberia, which points to the surmise that
the mammoth became extinct in Alaska before the last of the species succumbed
in Siberia. Associated with the mammoth were herds of large bison and horses.
This species of horse may have been the last native to North America, the rear
guard of the last migration of these animals across the region of Bering Straits
to Asia before the land connection disappeared. There was a species of musk-ox,
together with sheep and bear. Descendants of these last three forms have by -
adaptive changes survived in these northern regions down to the present time.

The relation that the fauna and flora north of the area occupied by glaciers
bore to that region, in the United States before, during, and after separation by
the snow and ice fields; also the relation of forms in Alaska to those of Siberia,
with the time and duration of the land connection across Bering Straits and
- their subsequent separation, form a complex problem, the solution of which will
require the accumulation of much material.

Mr. Maddren summarizes his conclusions as follows:

I. That while remnants of the large Pleistocene mammal herds may have
survived down to the Recent period and in some cases their direct descendants,
as the musk-ox, to the present, most of them became extinct in Alaska with the
close of Pleistocene.

II. The most rational way of explaining this extinction of animal life is by a
gradual changing of the climate from more temperate conditions, permitting of
a forest vegetation much farther north than now, to the more severe climate of
to-day, which, subduing the vegetation and thus reducing the food supply, besides
directly discomforting the animals themselves, has left only those forms capable
of adapting themselves to the Recent conditions surviving in these regions to
the present.

Ill. There are no facts to support the contention that the climate of the Arctic
and sub-Arctic regions ever has been colder than it is at present.- There are no
phenomena presented in those regions that require a more severe climate than
that now existing to account for them. There are no ice deposits in Alaska,
except those of large glaciers, that may be considered of Pleistocene age. There
are no ice beds interstratified with the Pleistocene deposits of Alaska.

IV. That the various forms of land ice, together with the deposits of peat,
now existing through the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of Alaska belong to the
Recent period, and these deposits may be most conveniently and logically classi-
fied by their position with reference to the Pleistocene and Recent formations
and the ice deposits, can not be differentiated satisfactorily into deposits of
snow or of water origin by their physical structure and character alone.

THE SMITHSONIAN GLACIER EXPEDITION.

The expedition dispatched by the Smithsonian Institution to the
Canadian Rockies and Selkirks, under the immediate direction of
Prof. William H. Sherzer, of the Michigan State Normal School,
had a successful season’s work on the glaciers along the line of the
Canadian Pacific Railway. .A selection was made of those five gla-
clers which are at the present time most readily accessible to the tour-
ist or the student of glacial geology, and these were found to exhibit,
more or less strikingly, the characteristics of glaciers throughout
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the world. It may be a matter of surprise to many to learn that
four or five days of comfortable railway travel places one in the
midst of snow fields rivaling in size and grandeur those of Switz-
erland, that the ice bodies descending from these fields may be studied
from modern hotels as a base, and that of those to be reported upon
one may safely ride a horse to the very nose of each. For trips on the
ice to the passes and neighboring peaks experienced Swiss guides are
available during the summer months. So far as is known, there is
here the most magnificent development of glaciers of the Alpine type
on the American continent, and the purpose of the survey was to
gather as much information concerning them as the time and facilities
rendered possible. Many photographs with which to illustrate the
details of glacial structure were obtained, a number of which ac-
company a preliminary report of the expedition printed in the
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. Professor Sherzer reviews
his work as follows:

Field work began July 1, 1904, with two assistants, and continued until the
middle of September, camps being made at Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, and in
Yoho, Asulkan, and Ilecillewaet valleys, in each case as close as practicable
to the glaciers under study. Quite in contrast with the two preceding summers,
that of 1904 proved exceptionally propitious for field studies. The unusual
number of bright days and the reduced precipitation, however, reacted unfavor-
ably in that they permitted forest fires to spread in several of the valleys, and
during. much of the summer the atmosphere was more or less charged with
smoke, rendering distant photography unsatisfactory or quite impossible.

Covered with a veneering of rock débris over its lower third, the Victoria
glacier, at Lake Louise, is not the most interesting of the series te the casual
observer, who is liable to carry home the idea that it is simply a stone heap,
and a rather uninteresting pile at that. Geologically, however, this glacier is
the most active and varied of any of those that can be conveniently reached in
the entire region, and nearly six weeks were devoted to the study of it and its
tributary, the Lefroy. In spite of the many visits which a camp alongside the
glacier for this length of time permitted, as well as numerous visits during two
previous seasons, not one failed to reveal some new feature or to shed important
light on one previously observed. This longer stay at the Victoria permitted
Ineasurements of the forward flow of ice under variable conditions of tempera-
ture, the construction of an accurate cross section, the determination of the
amount of surface melting, and the varying amounts of drainage and sediment
discharged—work which was not feasible on the other glaciers, to each of which
but seven or ten days could be devoted. <A detailed survey was made of each of
the five glaciers, from the nose around each way to the nevé field, by means
of plane table or compass and steel tape, and full data for a map of the ice and
moraines and for a general description were procured. Especial attention was
given to the structure of the ice itself, with the hope of shedding more light on
some of the points still under discussion.”

Only the most general statements concerning those results of the field studies
in which the scientific public may be interested will now be noted. The glaciers
generally were found to be still in retreat, the Wapta, at the head of Yoho
Valley, having exceeded its average of the last three years by a few feet, while
the Lllecillewaet, at Glacier House, receded but one-third of the average which it

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. We

has maintaind during the last seventeen years. The Asulkan, in an adjoining
yalley, which had been advancing for about two years, has remained practi-
cally stationary during the last year. The Victeria presents an oblique front
of nearly half a mile, and its lower 800 feet, completely veneered with rock
as above stated, has pushed out into the forest at a comparatively recent
date. This part has remained quiet apparently for a number of years, but accu-
rate measurements to stones embedded in the face show that a very gradual
wastage occurred during the summer, with a small stream of clear, ice-cold
water as confirmatory evidence.

Farther up, for a distance of about 1,600 feet, there is a steep ice front which
is so nearly parallel with the main axis of the glacier that there is a question as
to whether it is not its side. Here the front of the ice is receding, the amount
for the last year being about the same as the average maintained for the last
five or six years, and this in spite of an actual forward flowing movement of the
ice of 2 to 3 inches daily in summer and perhaps half this amount in winter.
The Wenckchemna glacier, in the Valley of the Ten Peaks, proved of exceptional
interest because of its almost unique character, only one other of the type—the
Malaspina in Alaska—having been described. The Wenckchemna consists of a
sluggish ice mass, relatively short, but broad, formed by the lateral coalescence
of about a dozen short ice streams, each of which retains its identity more or
less perfectly entirely across the glacier, and maintains its own nose and
motion independently of its neighbors. Accurate measurements to stones embedded
in the frontal slope showed that some of these ice streams are stationary, some
receding, and others advancing, the most rapid advance being near the center,
where freshly cut trees were observed. To those who do not fully appreciate
all the factors of the problem it is frequently a matter of surprise that a
glacier in one valley may be in retreat while that in an adjacent valley may be
advancing, as has just been the case in the Asulkan and Illecillewaet valleys;
but in the case of the Wenckchemna there is still more varied behavior in
streams that are actually side by side almost throughout their length.

PUBLICATIONS.

It is largely through its publications that the Institution carries
out that vital principle of its foundation, “the diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” Each year adds something of importance to the
long series of published works comprised in the Smithsonian Contri-
butions to Knowledge, the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,
and its Annual Reports. All these are published by the parent Insti-
tution, but the series is augmented by the Proceedings and Bulletins
of the National Museum, the Reports and Bulletins of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, and the Annals of the Astrophysical Ob-
servatory, which bring before the public specialized matter no less
important.

The details of the work of the past year are given in the Editor’s
report, the subjects treated in that time including practically every
branch of human knowledge.

To the series of Contributions there has been added a third memoir
by Dr. Carl Barus, entitled “A Continuous Record of Atmospheric
Nucleation,” in which the author further discusses his researches on
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the nucleus, as published in “ Experiments with Ionized Air” (Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge, vol. xxrx, 1901) and in. “ Strue-
ture of the Nucleus,” issued as part of the same volume in 1903. The
investigation was carried on with the aid of a grant from the Hodg-
kins fund. Doctor Barus describes the nucleus as a dust particle
small enough to float in the air but larger than the order of molec-
ular size, and shows that such a particle precipitates condensation in
an atmosphere saturated with water in its immediate vicinity. He
uses the term “nucleation ” to denote the number of nuclei per cubic
centimeter regardless of their source—which may be from mechan-
ical, thermal, chemical, high potential, or radio-active processes—or
their special properties. By far the greater number are initially
ionized, or at least carry an electric charge, and where they occur in
thousands and millions of approximately uniform size they give
rise to condensational phenomena of transcendent beauty and im-
portance.

The articles printed in the Miscellaneous Collections are, as the
name of the series would indicate, miscellaneous in character. The
past year has added 38 numbers to this series of papers, including
several relating to the bibliography of chemistry; an exhaustive
catalogue of Diptera, or two-winged flies, showing the geographical
distribution of several species known to spread disease; accounts of
explorations in Alaska and among the Canadian glaciers; some in-
teresting popular papers by Doctor Gill on the sculpin, the tarpon,
the ladyfish, and the carp, and a lecture by Dr. Andrew D. White on
the diplomatic service of the United States, the first of the series of
lectures under the Hamilton bequest.

The Contributions and Miscellaneous Collections just spoken of are
published at the expense of the Institution fund in editions of 1,500
copies, and are intended solely for distribution to the large lbraries
and institutions of learning throughout the world.

The Annual Report, on the other hand, is published by a Govern-
ment appropriation in an edition of some 12,000, and is intended
for a more general distribution. Primarily, this volume is a report
to Congress on the operations of the Institution during the year, but
its popular interest lies largely in its General Appendix, contain-
ing a number of papers showing the recent progress of the world’s
scientific work. To the selection of appropriate papers for this Ap-
pendix I have given much personal attention for several years past.

The manuscript of the work of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode, on
some contributions of America to the progress of science, which dur-
ing the past year has been worked over by Mr. Kenneth M. Goode,
editorial assistant, is now almost in its final shape, and will, I hope,
appear as a Smithsonian publication during the coming year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

The Institution proper distributed during the year a total ot
60,063 volumes or parts of volumes of the series of Smithsonian
Contributions, Miscellaneous Collections, Reports, and publications
not included in the regular series, making an increase of 13,455
over the number sent out during the previous year.

THE LIBRARY.

The library of the Smithsonian Institution is, first of all, a library
of science, and, secondly, a collection of catalogues and bibliographical
apparatus. ‘The general aim, as stated in the original plan, has been
“to procure a complete collection of the memoirs and transactions
of learned societies throughout the world, and an entire set of the
most important scientific and literary periodicals.” In 1866 the main
portion of the Smithsonian library was for administrative purposes
transferred to the custody of the Library of Congress, and became one
of the important elements of that great National Library. This
collection continues as the Smithsonian Deposit. It has annually
increased in size and importance, and at present aggregates nearly
half a million entries.

There is retained at the Institution such books as are of immediate
importance to investigators carrying on their researches in the
Smithsonian buildings This reference collection, together with the
special libraries of the National Museum, the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, the National Zoological Park, and the Bureau of American
Ethnology, numbers about. 55,000 volumes.

Besides the accessions of books from customary sources, during
the past year there has been received a valuable library relating to
civil engineering bequeathed to the Institution by the late Dr. J.
Elfreth Watkins; also a collection of about 1,600 books on the flora
-of tropical America, presented by Capt. John Donnell Smith, and a
large number of additions to the Watts de Peyster Collection Napo-
leon Bounaparte.

The International Catalogue of Scientific Literature established
three years ago, with administrative headquarters in London, now
contains over half a million reference cards, 50,000 of which are
references made for the United States by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. The entire work of preparing cards for this country is done
in connection with the library of the Institution, the cost of the
work thus far having been borne out of an allotment made by the
Institution.

aContributions to Knowledge, 4,540; Miscellaneous Collections, 27,558; Re-
ports, 25,425; publications not in regular series, 1,905; publications not Smith-
sonian yet distributed by the Institution, 635.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

CORRESPONDENCE.

From its correspondence it appears that the Institution is generally
considered by the public as an establishment to which requests may
be addressed for information on all branches of knowledge, for the
solution of various scientific problems, for the examination and
indorsement both of scientific investigations and crude, unscientific
speculations, for supplying answers to questions in prize contests, and
the like. It seems well, therefore, to state that while responses are
cheerfully given, as far as practicable, to all legitimate requests for
scientific information, the Institution does not undertake to maintain
a general question bureau. The communications received cover every
conceivable subject, from new theories of the physical phenomena of
the universe to a request for information as to the value of some sup-
posedly rare book, and the preparation of the data desired entails
the expenditure of a considerable amount of time and labor by the
members of the Institution’s staff. Many of these correspondents
are men of considerable culture and of much general reading, but are
wanting in that special training which is necessary for successful
scientific investigation, and correspondence with this class is especially
dificult to manage, since the rejection of the propositions made is
generally attributed to prejudice and is resented by the writers, who
array themselves as martyrs to science. it

During the year many letters have been received from inventors
who desire either grants of money with which to develop their various
devices or an expression of the Institution’s opinion as to the merits °
of their inventions. As the Institution has no funds from which such
aid can be given, and as the Secretary is prohibited by a decision of
the Board of Regents from expressing an opinion of this character,
he is obliged to refuse all such requests. It would seem proper to
state also that the Institution does not supply information of a com-
mercial nature, such as is customarily furnished for a fee by engineers
or other professional advisers, or which is designed to benefit some
individual rather than the public.

In spite of these restrictions, however, the conduct of this corre-
spondence is an important agency for the diffusion of knowledge
among men.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART.

In the message of President Roosevelt communicated to the two
Houses of Congress at the beginning of the third session of the
Fifty-eighth Congress (dated December 6, 1904) he says:

The collection of art contemplated in section 5586 of the Revised Statutes
should be designated and established as a national gallery of art, and the

Smithsonian Institution should be authorized to accept any additions to said
collection that may be received by gift, bequest, or devise.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. rk

The section of the Revised Statutes cited by the President is the
act of foundation of the Smithsonian Institution, which declares
that “ whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to
time for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious
research, all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and
mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States * * *
shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board
of Regents to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified
in the building erected for the Institution as best to facilitate the
examination and study of them;” so that the first object of the
Institution, in the eyes of its founders, appears to have been to give
it the curatorship of the Art collections of the nation.

During its early years this object was promoted in various ways;
among others, by the acquisition of a very valuable collection of prints
and engravings belonging to the Hon. George P. Marsh. After the
fire in the Institution in 1865 these prints were deposited for tempo-
rary safe-keeping in the Library of Congress and (with other works
of art) in the Corcoran Gallery.

Subsequently an appropriation was granted by Congress for mak-
ing a fireproof room in which these could be kept, but it was not until
1896 that the Regents provided for their recall to the Institution. In
the journal of the proceedings of the Board for 1896 (Smithsonian
Report, 1896, pp. xii and xiv) will be found the action taken by the
Board providing for their restoration to their own immediate control.
The following resolution offered then by Senator Gray was adopted:

Resolved, That the question of the propriety of bringing the works of art
belonging to the Institution under the more immediate control of the Board of
Regents be referred to the executive committee and the Secretary, with power
to act.

In pursuance of this the Institution brought back to its own keep-
ing a number of prints of value, both from the Library of Congress
and the Corcoran Gallery, leaving, by an amicable understanding with
the latter establishment, as a loan, a few of the works of art, notably
a large picture by Healy.

The old name of the collections was the “ Gallery of Art,” a title
which seems almost too ambitious for the present collections of the
Institution, though it is to be hoped that this designation will be
justified by their future increase. These have been placed by me in a
room specially fitted up for that purpose (the Art Room), under the
temporary charge of the hbrarian.

There is now in the courts awaiting legal interpretation a will con-
taining a bequest of a valuable collection of art objects.

On January 3, 1905, Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, offered under
certain contingencies to bequeath to the Smithsonian Institution his
valuable art collection, proposing at the same time to provide after
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

his death for a building of appropriate design and proportion, pro-
vided the Institution would undertake its maintenance. The objects
include a remarkable collection of the works of the late J. A. McNeil
Whistler and a number of oriental art objects. The proposal of
Mr. Freer is still under consideration by the Board of Regents.

HAMILTON LECTURE.

A number of years ago Mr. James Hamilton left a small bequest to
the Smithsonian Institution, the income of which was to be appro-
priated biennially by the Secretary, either in money or a medal, for
such contribution, paper, or lecture on any scientific or useful sub-
ject as the Secretary might approve.

The Regents of the Institution decided to let this small sum accu-
mulate, and it is only recently that the Secretary has found himself
able to commence to employ the income as a lecture fund. The first
address under the auspices of this fund was delivered by Dr. Andrew
D. White, LL. D., D. C. L., in the lecture hall of the National
Museum on March 9, 1905, and was entitled “* The Diplomatic Serv-
ice of the United States with some Hints toward its Reform.”

This lecture was printed by the Smithsonian Institution as a pam-
phlet of some twenty pages and was distributed to members of Con-
gress, officers of the Department of State, various members of the
diplomatic corps, the libraries of the larger universities, presidents of
colleges, and others likely to be interested in the important question
discussed.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

A great museum, in the modern usage of the word, has been defined
as “an institution for the preservation of those objects which best
illustrate the phenomena of nature and the works of man, and the
utilization of these for the increase of knowledge and for the culture
and enlightenment of the people.” This thought is that of one very
especially conversant with the subject, and implies both a collection
for the student and an exhibition for the visitor. It is this second
part of the museum’s work, the exhibition collection, which was
probably in the minds of those who originally described the future
Smithsonian museum as containing “ objects of art and of foreign
and curious research,” although even at that early date they added
“and all objects of natural history, plants, and zoological and min-
eralogical specimens belonging to the United States.” Under the
impulse of Congressional legislation the Museum has obtained a
signal advantage over the national museums of other countries, since
by law all collections made by the surveys of the Government of the
United States must be deposited here, thus providing for the sys-
tematic preservation of collections of great extent and vast im-
portance.

From the foundation of the Institution to about 1857 its specimens
were collected solely to serve as materials for research, and the exhi-
bition collections belonging to the United States were maintained
at the Patent Office. At the date mentioned Congress made an
appropriation to the Smithsonian Institution for the building of
cases to receive these collections, which were known as the “ National
Cabinet of Curiosities,” and from that time on the Institution’s
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

museum besides aiding students served to instruct and entertain the
public. The great growth of the Museum dates from the close of
the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, since’ which time collections have
been actively gathered and exhibited because of their educational
value. Neither purpose has been lost sight of because of the other,
and the instruction of the public has been secured not only by digni-
fied exhibition of interesting objects, but by adding to them series of
instructive labels based upon the maxim that a good educational
museum consists in a series of carefully prepared labels with well
selected specimens attached. With these two great purposes in mind
the Museum has now succeeded in bringing together catalogued
objects amounting to over 6,000,000 in number, the exhibition series
being so installed that the individual objects or groups would not
stand as inert curiosities by themselves, but are arranged in such
manner as to show their relation either to the orderly development
of nature or to the varied manifestations of human thought and
activity.

Tt can not but be realized that the Museum’s main attainment from
this point of view consists not only of the collections or of the build-
ing which houses them, but to an ever increasing degree in the posses-
sion of the experts who have the custody of these collections and the
knowledge to classify them and to make them available for public
instruction. I regret to say that the enormous growth of the col-
lections in the Museum has not been accompanied by any proportion-
ate increase in its administrative and scientific staff. The greatest
efficiency can hardly make up for the numerical inability to cope with
the increasing work, and it becomes each year more painfully appar-
ent that the personnel of the establishment must be materially aug-
mented if the present standards are to be maintained.

Despite this paucity of workers and the congested halls, the past year
has been as successful as any in the history of the National’ Museum.
During this time more additions to its collections have been recorded
than in any previous year save the period immediately following
the Centennial Exhibition of 1876. From the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition alone over thirty carloads were received, including many
valuable ethnological and technological exhibits. Besides this there
were the usual accessions from the Government surveys and from do-
nations and exchanges. Altogether, nearly 250,000 specimens have
been entered during the year, while a mass of material is yet to be
sorted out, these recent additions bringing the total number of speci-
mens now preserved in the Museum collections well over 6,000,000.

That only a very small fraction of these specimens can ever be on
public exhibition is evident, yet those stored away are by no means
the least important. The scientific staff is constantly engaged in re-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25)

search in connection with the work of classification, and students
from kindred institutions frequently visit Washington or have col-
lections sent to them for investigation.

Duplicate material is used, when not actually needed for study,
for the purpose of exchange with other museums, and to a limited
extent, by authority given by Congress to the Regents of the Institu-
tion, for distribution among American schools. Fourteen thousand
specimens were distributed during the past year to schools and
colleges throughout the land for the general purpose of promoting
education.

The present crowded condition of the biulding has rendered it
difficult to place any more collections there, and such as come in from
one source or another are in the main temporarily stored in rented
buildings. While it has been found impossible to increase the
amount of material on exhibition, the standard of the objects ex-
hibited is being constantly improved, and the methods of installation
represent the most modern practice in this regard.

In the division of ethnology a place has been made for a Malaysian
collection contributed by Dr. W. L. Abbott and an interesting Philip-
pine exhibit gathered by Dr. E. A. Mearns. Over the hall of
mammals has been hung the cast of a great sulphur-bottom whale,
about 80 feet in length. Another noteworthy addition during the
past year is the reconstructed skeleton of a gigantic Triceratops, meas-
uring almost 20 feet.

During the course of the year scme 235,000 persons, an average of
753 visitors a day, have viewed these collections. This number would
unquestionably be greatly increased should it become feasible to open
the building at night or on Sundays.

Work on the new building, for the continuation of which Congress
at its last session appropriated $1,500,000, is progressing satisfac-
torily. The excavation was completed and the heavy conerete founda-
tion laid last autumn. The erection of the outer walls of granite is
now well under way.

The completion of this structure will, it is hoped, mark the begin-
ning of a new era in the activities of the National Museum. No
longer cramped for space, it can suitably care for the splendid col-
lections intrusted to its care; by exhibiting these, and by labels, pub-
lications, and lectures, it will still further endeavor to impart definite
instruction along definite lines to all who care to learn. Then, as
now, the first great lesson it will try to enforce is that a museum is
in nowise a cabinet of curios to while away an idle moment, but an
active instrument for the diffusion of knowledge among men.

26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The energies of the Bureau during the past year have been devoted
chiefly to preparing for publication the proposed Handbook of
Indians, which will include not only descriptions of the tribes and
their settlements, but also popular articles covering the whole range
of ethnological and archeological research relating to them. No
work of its kind so comprehensive in scope has ever been attempted,
and the effort to combine popular treatment with scientific accuracy
has involved an extra amount of time and labor. Almost all the
prominent ethnologists of the country have written special articles
for the Handbook, and all the staff of the Bureau and ethnologists
resident in the city have aided in criticism and revision.

Though somewhat curtailed through the necessity of retaining
several ethnologists for work on the Handbook, the field work of the
Bureau has been continued in Maryland, Virginia, Oklahoma, Indian
Territory, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Mexico. Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes, under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, made an
extended archeological trip through Mexico; Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, of
the National Museum, made a visit to Arizona in behalf of the
Bureau; and Mr. E. L. Hewett was commissioned to visit New Mex-
ico for the purpose of making researches among the ancient ruins of -
the so-called Pajarito Park district.

The systematic study of visiting Indian delegations has been con-
tinued with success. During the year 22 delegations consented to
be photographed, and in some cases allowed themselves to be meas-
ured and even to have plaster casts of their faces taken.

The work of compiling an archeological map of the United
States, which had received some attention in previous years, was
carried forward with all possible dispatch during the past year.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has for more than fifty years been the medium of exchange of
documents and scientific publications between the Government and
learned institutions of the United States and those of foreign coun-
tries. Through its operations the Library of Congress has secured
a large collection of public documents, and an unequaled collection of
scientific serials has been acquired by the Institution for its deposit
in the Library of Congress. Each year the service grows in size
and importance. The weight of packages handled by it in 1899
was 317,883 pounds; in 1905 it was 474,871 pounds, an increase of
40 per cent in six years.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

hel

The number of exchange correspondents now aggregates 51,880,
or nearly 4,000 more than the number ten years ago. These are scat-
tered throughout every corner of the civilized world, and new centers
of scientific activity are opening up every year. It is largely through
the system of International Exchanges that the Institution realizes
the catholicity of its founder’s bequest, which contemplated the
diffusion of knowledge among all men. Moreover, this constant
exchange of courtesies among the learned institutions of the world
has not only served to enrich the universities, libraries, museums, and
learned societies of our country and those with whom we exchange.
but has at the same time done much to promote friendly relations
among the nations themselves.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The annual appropriation made for the service of the National
Zoological Park was in the following terms:

For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water supply, sewer-
age, and drainage; and for grading, planting, and otherwise improving the
grounds; erecting and repairing buildings and inclosures and providing seats
in the park; care, subsistence, purchase, and transportation of animals, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees; the purchase of necessary
books and periodicals; the printing and publishing of operations, not exceeding
one thousand five hundred copies, and general incidental expenses not otherwise
provided for, ninety-five thousand dollars.

The collection of animals exhibited has increased, and comprised at
the end of the year over 1,300 individuals of all species. A consid-
erable number of these were born at the park, and 128 birds were
received from the exhibit made at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.

The new house for mammals, mentioned in last year’s report, 1s
now approaching completion and will constitute one of the most
attractive features of the park. As this structure is necessarily built
from the general appropriation for the park, its progress is limited
by the amount of funds available for use. As the care of the animals,
the maintenance of the collection, the improvement and care of the
grounds, including the roads and walks, the repair of all structures,
fences, and inclosures must also be defrayed from this appropriation,
it is obvious that considerable economy must be exercised in order to
have any funds for the erection of buildings.

The park exists, in the words of the act of Congress, * for the
advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the
people.” The first and primary object is never to be lost sight of, but
in pursuance of the second much is done to facilitate the visits of those
who seek the pleasant influences of rural scenery and open air. For
this reason it is thought that attempts should be made to enhance the
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

park features by greater care of the indigenous trees and the planting
of copses where such are required, by the establishment of seats, and
by perfecting the roads and walks as far as practicable. The park is
now the nearest to the city of any large stretch of open, picturesque
country, and this would seem to be almost a duty owed to the public.

This again brings to mind a project often urged upon Congress, but
never realized by an actual appropriation for the work. I refer to
the plan for extending the park to the nearest boundary road on the
southeast and the west. This has often been referred to in previous
annual reports, and it would seem that the present time is particularly
favorable for the accomplishment of this object, simce roads have
recently been established by act of Congress quite near to the present
boundaries.

Among the more pressing needs of the park is a small building
with outlying yards, which can be used as a hospital and quarantine
for sick animals and, incidentally, as a pathological and anatomical
laboratory. In this connection, in view of the fact that the primary
object of the park is for “ the advancement of science,” it must be
considered how much our knowledge has been increased by such es-
tablishments as the Jardin des Plantes, of Paris, under Buffon, Cuvier,
or Milne-Edwards; the gardens of the Zoological Society in London,
by Huxley and others, and those at Berlin and elsewhere. I approve
the recommendation of the superintendent that a modest laboratory
tor pathological research be added to the park equipment.

During the last year the number of visitors to the park has further
increased, and it is not too much to say that no equal expenditure by
Congress has brought so much of instruction and rational enjoyment
to the people.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

As for several years past, the operations of the Astrophysical
Observatory have been almost wholly directed toward measuring the
amount of the solar radiation, and its loss in transmission through
the sun’s envelope and through our own atmosphere.

I do not yet regard the evidence of solar variability as conclusive,
but still as rendering this conclusion more probable, and I am glad
to state that two lnes of investigation have this year become very
prominent in the work of the Observatory, which will almost. cer-
tainly lead to a conclusion regarding this important question.

The first of these is the almost daily bolometric examination of the
large solar image formed by the great horizontal telescope, for the
purpose of detecting changes in the transparency of the solar absorb-
ing envelope. This work depends so little on the transparency of our
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

own atmosphere that it can be done almost as well in Washington as at
a station more favored as regards atmospheric transparency and free-
dom from clouds. The past year has not given evidence of very
marked variations either in the transparency of the sun’s envelope
or in the supposedly dependent mean temperature of the earth, but
on the contrary the observations have continued most of the time near
the mean in both respects. Such changes as have been noted are not,
however, contradictory to the view that alterations of the transpar-
ency of the sun’s envelope do occur, and cause changes in the amount
of solar radiation received by the earth, which in turn cause depar-
tures of the earth’s temperature from its mean.

The second line of investigation to which IT have referred above is
the determination of the total solar radiation outside our atmosphere,
by observations with the bolometer and pyrheliometer at a station
located in a relatively clear and cloudless region and at a considerable
altitude above sea level. As long ago as February, 1902, at the re-
quest of the Hon. C. D. Walcott, and for the consideration of the
Carnegie Institution, I urged in a letter to him the great utility of an
observatory for solar research to be located at a high altitude and
charged with the determination of the question of the amount of solar
radiation and the limits of its variability. An observatory for solar
research has now, in fact, been established by the Carnegie Institution
on Mount Wilson, in southern California, after extensive tests of
different proposed sites. By invitation of the director, Prof. George
K. Hale, and in accord with the authorization of Congress for the
undertaking of observations at high altitudes by the Astrophysical
Observatory, I have sent to Mount Wilson an expedition in charge of
Mr. C. G. Abbot, for the purpose of determining the conditions for
studying the variability of the sun.

The expedition is equipped with spectro-bolometric and pyrhelio-
metric apparatus of the highest quality, and wholly adequate to
making the most accurate possible determinations of solar radiation
and its transmission through our atmosphere. As I have elsewhere
remarked, I am not convinced that it is possible to estimate exactly
the loss of radiation in our atmosphere by any observations whatever,
but it does seem that the estimates which can be made from the
observations of the Mount Wilson expedition will be so close an
approximation to the truth that if a notable variation of solar
radiation outside our atmosphere occurs the results will show it.
Furthermore, similar observations are being continued as usual in
Washington. Mr. Abbot reports that the sky above Mount Wilson
is of great clearness and uniformity, and that weeks and even months
pass there without a cloud appearing above the horizon, so that
observations may be made almost every day with good prospects
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of success. It is expected that the expedition will remain on Mount
Wilson until late in the autumn.

I take this opportunity to express my obligation to the Carnegie
Institution and to Professor Hale and his coworkers for the aid
and counsel they have so generously extended in furthering the
objects of the expedition.

Additional details of the work of the Astrophysical Observatory
will be found in the report of the aid acting in charge.

NECROLOGY.
ORVILLE HITCHCOCK PLATT.

Tt is with a keen personal regret that I have to record the death
on April 22, 1905, of Senator Orville H. Platt, of Connecticut, who
for six years had served on the Board of Regents, and who at all
times took much personal interest in the welfare of the Institution.

Senator Platt was born in Washington, Conn., July 19, 1827.
After an academic education he undertook the study of law at Litch-
field. He was admitted to the bar in 1849, and practiced at Meriden.
He became secretary of state of Connecticut in 1857. In 1861-62
he was a State senator; later he served as a member of the State
house of representatives and as speaker of that body. From 1879
until the time of his death he was United States Senator from his
native State, and his public life belongs to his country. I shall not
add here my poor testimony to that of the history which will record
his contribution to the national good. He was a man honored by
all and best loved by those who best knew him.

Respectfully submitted.

S. P. Laneey,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the condition and
operations of the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1905.

At the beginning of the year the excavation for the new building on the north-
ern side of the Mall was actively under way and in the autumn the heavy
concrete foundations were completed. In October, 1904, the contracts were
executed for the granite required for the outer walls and for the trimmings of
the two courts. Contracts for other materials were also entered into at intervals
during the remainder of the year, all at prices which insure the putting up of
the structure within the limit of $3,500,000 fixed by Congress. It was hoped
that work upon the basement might begin by February or March, but unfortu-
uately the winter was severe, with much snow, which interfered with quarrying,
and up to the close of the fiscal year not enough stone had been received to
warrant the commencement of building operations. The date at which this
report is written, however, permits it to be said that the first basement stone
was laid on August 21, 1905, and no further delays are anticipated.

In respect to the increase of collections, the year’s record has neyer been
exceeded, except during the period immediately following the Centennial Exhi-
bition of 1876. There were the usual accessions from the Government surveys
and through donation and exchange, but the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,
held at St. Louis, furnished an opportunity probably not soon again to be
presented for securing a very large amount of valuable material, especially in
ethnology, mineral technology, and other branches of the useful arts, which was
accepted to the extent of over thirty carloads. Only a small proportion of these
objects could, however, be directly added to the classified and exhibition collec-
tions, owing to lack of space, and the greater part have been placed in storage
to await the completion of the new building.

Among the additions from other sources was one of special moment consisting
of the large and important private herbarium and botanical library of Capt.
John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore, which the owner has most generously pre-
sented. The former comprises over 100,000 mounted plants, and the latter
above 1,500 volumes.

The number of accessions, including only that small part of the material
from the exposition which it was possible to place on record, was 1,692, and of
specimens 245,384.

Except for the crowded state of the buildings, the Museum is now in as
good condition as at any time in its history. The standard of the exhibition
collections was materially improved, though their expansion practically ceased
some years ago. The reserve, or study, collections were extensively utilized

. 31
oo! REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in the promotion of knowledge, and duplicate specimens to the number of over
14,000 were distributed to educational establishments throughout the country.

Buildings and equipment.—The roofs of the Museum building have, as usual,
demanded most attention in the matter of repairs. ‘The temporary strengthen-
ing a few years ago of the supporting iron framework over the main halls
has continued to be effective, but most of the slate covering had so far deterio-
rated that in 1904 the roof above the east hall was coated experimentally with
asphalt, burlap, and slag. Having answered its purpose through one season,
the roofs of the‘other halls and of the rotunda and one pavilion were similarly
treated during last year. The metal work upon the roofs also required extensive
overhauling, and several skylights were added. The 20 large windows in
archeological hall, which have been approaching a condition bordering upon
collapse, were completely repaired and made practically as strong as ever.

In view of the crowded condition of all the public halls, the building of only
a few exhibition cases was called for. 'To provide, however, for the care and
arrangement of the very extensive accessions received during the year, mainly
from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the Government surveys, and a few
large private donations, a considerable amount of storage furniture was de-
manded. The number of permanent cases of this character constructed was
213, and of drawers 1,032, in addition to which much shelving was put up and
many boxes made for the storage of material in bulk and the distribution of
duplicates.

The heating plant, with the addition of a few radiators, has given good
service. Steam was maintained from October 8, 1904, to May 2, 1905, on an
average of sixteen hours a day, the expenditure of coal amounting to 8380 tons.
A new arrangement of telephones was effected at the beginning of the year
whereby the cost was materially reduced, and as a special fire precaution six
standard alarm boxes of the pattern used by the District of Columbia have
been installed in different parts of the Museum building.

Organization and staff—The organization of the Museum remains the same
as heretofore, except that a Department of Mineral Technology, with Dr.
Charles D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological Survey, as cu-
rator, was established in the autumn of 1904, to permit of proper direction in
the selection of objects relating to this subject at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition.

Dr. Cyrus Adler was made curator, and Dr. I. M. Casanowicz assistant cu-
rator of the Division of Historic Archeology. In the Division of Plants Dr.
J. N. Rose was advanced to associate curator and Mr. W. R. Maxon to assistant
curator, the position of aid being filled by the appointment of Mr. J. H. Painter.
Dr. James E. Benedict, assistant curator of the Division of Marine Inverte-
brates, has supervised the exhibits in biology and had charge of the collections
of comparative anatomy. Mr. Herbert S. Barber was appointed aid in the
Division of Insects, and Mr. B. H. Ransom, of the Bureau of Animal Industry,
assistant custodian of the Helminthological collections.

Mr. Charles Schuchert, for some years assistant curator of Stratigraphic
Paleontology, who resigned to accept the professorship of paleontology in Yale
University, has been succeeded by Dr. Ray S. Bassler. Vacancies in the Sec-
tion of Vertebrate Paleontology were filled by the selection of Mr. James W.
ridley and Mr. Charles W. Gilmore as preparators, and of Mr. Norman H.
Boss as assistant preparator.

The following gentlemen, to whom the Museum has become indebted for dis-
tinguished services or noteworthy contributions, were designated as honorary
associates: In historic archeology, Dr. Paul Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University :
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

in zoology, Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadephia; in botany, Capt. John Donnel}
Smith, of Baltimore; in mineralogy, Rey. L. T. Chamberlain, of New York City ;
in paleobotany, Prof. Lester F. Ward, of Washington.

Additions to the collections——The principal source of accessions during the
past year was the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The exhibition made in that
connection by the Museum itself contained many important objects acquired
through the Government appropriation for the exposition, which, excepting such
as were seat to the Lewis and Clark Exposition, were subsequently incorporated
in the publie series here. Much more extensive and noteworthy, however, were
the gifts made to the national collections by several foreign governments, by
many States of the Union, and by a large number of individuals having
exhibits at St. Louis. So extensive, in fact, were these contributions that they
amounted in bulk to about 20 carloads of specimens, besides five of exhibition
eases. Of this number 25 cars were filled with collections illustrative of
mineral technology alone, comprising examples of the natural and finished
products and of the appliances of manufacture in many branches of mineral
industry. Unfortunately the arrangement and display of this instructive
material must be deferred until more space becomes available through the com-
pletion of the new building. The Department of Geology also received many
important additions, especially in the way of large masses and pieces appro-’
priate for exhibition.. The contributions in ethnology, next in extent to those
in mineral technology, were exceedingly varied and interesting, since they relate
to the customs and industries of several peoples, and will richly supplement the
existing collections.

Through the accessions already noted, the total number of specimens in the
Museum has been increased to about 6,141,990, classified as follows: Anthro-
pology, 986,964 ; biology, 4,499,185; geology, 745,891.

The most noteworthy additions in ethnology, besides those obtained at St.
Louis, were from the several islands between Sumatra and Borneo, the Mergui
Archipelago, and the island of Mindanao of the Philippine group; from pueblos,
_cliff houses, and caves in western Socorro County, New Mexico; and from the
Apache and Pima Indians of Arizona, and the pueblo of Zuni. To the collec-
tions in physical anthropology was added a large amount of material bearing
upon the natural history of several races of man, especially the American
Indians, Negroes, Slavs, and Filipinos.

The most important acquisitions in historic archeology consisted of Arabic
manuscripts and prints from the Moros of Mindanao, and of coins, pottery
lamps, and jars from the Orient. The Division of Prehistoric Archeology ob-
tained two valuable collections of implements from Japan; many interesting
specimens from Australia and Tasmania, Cape Colony, Thuringia (Germany),
and Belmonti, Italy; and a large number of stone implements and pottery
from the United States, Mexico, and South America.

The collection of timekeeping devices was increased by several gifts and
loans, and acknowledgments are due to the War Department for depositing
numerous pieces of ordnance, among them being many of considerable historic
interest.

The Division of Graphic Arts received many contributions from foreign
exhibitors at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and two pictures taken by
Daguerre. Among the accessions in ceramics were an extensive and very
beautiful collection of glassware from the Union Glass Works; examples of
Teco ware and Van Briggle pottery, and a collection of typical Japanese and
Chinese porcelains and pottery and of Japanese lacquer work.

To the collection of American history were added 768 objects, mostly loans.
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

including many personal military relics and examples of the wearing apparel
and other articles of the colonial period in Maryland and New York.

Mention may here be made of the large oil portrait of the Empress Dowager
of China, painted by Miss Katherine A. Carl and presented to the United
States by the Government .of China, with appropriate ceremonies at the White .
House. The picture, encased in its heavy and elaborately carved frame of
camphor wood, was transferred directly to the custody of the Museum and
temporarily installed in the lecture hall.

About 217,538 specimens were acquired by the Department of Biology, the
principal increases as regards number of specimens being in the divisions of
Plants, Insects, and Mollusks, though in other branches the additions were not
less important. The Division of Mammals received large collections contain-
ing many novelties from Malaysia and the Philippine Islands, besides many
interesting specimens from southern Europe, Brazil, and Japan, the Kamerun
district of West Africa, and Bewean Island in the Java Sea. The most impor-
tant additions to the Division of Birds were from the Philippine Islands,
Malaysia, and Costa Rica. Of reptiles, collections were obtained from Japan,
Formosa, the Philippine Islands, Malaysia, China, France, Switzerland,
Jamaica, Guatemala, and several parts of the United States. The Division of
Fishes received by transfer from the United States Bureau of Fisheries type
collections from Samoan waters and Hawaii, and a very large number of
specimens from the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America.

The Bureau of Fisheries was also the largest single contributor to the Divi-
sion of Mollusks, haying transferred some 5,000 specimens from recent dredg-
ings of the steamer Albatross on the coast of California. Other important
accessions comprised land and fresh-water shells from Texas, California, and
Montana; about 1,500 identified specimens of Philippine shells from the collec-
tion of the late Herr Mollendorff, and many marine mollusks from Alaska.
While no single large collection was received by the Division of Insects, yet
as a whole the additions were of average importance, aggregating over 34,000
specimens from many parts of the world.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates obtained from the Bureau of Fisheries
300 lots of foraminifera from the region about the Hawaiian Islands and a
large collection of crustaceans and samples of ocean bottom from the Albatross
cruise of the winter of 1904-5 in the eastern part of the Central Pacific.
The most important additions to the Helminthological Collection was a series
of parasites from Hgypt.

The past year has been especially noteworthy as regards the increase of the
collection in the Division of Plants, the additions having been very much greater
than in any previous year in the history of the Museum, embracing 750 acces-
sions and 143,690 specimens. This was chiefly owing to the generous gift by
Capt. John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore, of his entire private herbarium,
which alone contained 100,889 specimens from different regions, but mainly
from tropical America. This large and valuable donation, the work of many
years in assembling, was accompanied by a choice botanical library of over
1,500 volumes. The next important contribution was by transfer from the
United States Department of Agriculture of 13,965 specimens from many parts
of the United States, and from Alaska, Greenland, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala,
Hurope, and India.

The Department of Geology acquired by gift at the Louisiana Purchase Expo-
sition important series of ores, minerals, and economic products from Brazil,
Siam, Ceylon, Greece, and several of the States, and through other sources,
many interesting minerals and cut gems.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

The collections in Stratigraphic Paleontology were mainly increased through
transfers from the Geological Survey, of which the principal ones consisted of
large numbers of Niagaran fossils from Tennessee, of Ordovician fossils from
the slates at Arvonia, Va., and of Devonian and Carboniferous fossils from
Colorado. A very valuable acquisition was the gift by Mr. E. O. Ulrich and
Dr. R. S. Bassler of the type and figured specimens of G5 species. The Section
of Vertebrate Paleontology received two large collections from the Geological
Survey, one made in the Wasatch Hocene of the Big Horn basin, Wyoming, the
other from the Oligocene of Oelrichs, S. Dak. In Paleobotany, the most
important additions were about 400 specimens from the coal fields of Sao
Paulo and Santa Catharina, Brazil, and about the same number from the
higher beds of the anthracite series in the vicinity of Pottsville, Pa.

Explorations ——As custodian of the national collections, the Museum depends
chiefly for its increment upon the Government explorations conducted by such
establishments as the Geological Survey, the Bureau of Fisheries, several of the
bureaus of the Department of Agriculture charged with biological research,
and the Bureau of American Ethnology, though in the history of the Museum
both the Army and Nayy have figured conspicuously. The very limited means
available for the purpose prevents any extended amount of field work by
members of the Museum staff.

From October, 1904, to March, 1905, the steamer Albatross, of the Bureau of
Visheries, made extensive explorations in the eastern part of the Central Pacific
Ocean, under the scientific direction of Dr. Alexander Agassiz. For the Bureau
of American Ethnology Dr. J. Walter Fewkes investigated the sites of ancient
Totonac semicivilization in southern Mexico, and Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson
continued her studies among the Zuni Indians of New Mexico, both of these
expeditions being productive of important collections. Mr. E. A. Schwarz,
who visited Cuba for the Department of Agriculture, brought back a large collec-
tion of insects which is especially rich in Coleoptera. Mr. A. G. Maddren,
under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, made a reconnoissance of a
part of the Yukon River basin of Alaska, during which he secured fragmentary
remains of several interesting Pleistocene mammals.

Reference should also be made to the movements of two of the most generous
benefactors of the Museum, Dr. W. L. Abbott and Maj. Edgar A. Mearns, sur-
geon, U. S. Army, from both of whom important contributions were received
during the year. The former, with headquarters at Singapore, has recently been
working in the Mergui Archipelago and on the islands of Banka, Billiton, and
Karimata, where his detailed and painstaking inquiries have furnished most
important results in both zoology and ethnology; the latter, who was with the
army of Maj. Gen. Leonard Weod on the island of Mindanao, has collected in
the same lines and with the same care.

Of field work conducted by assistants of the Museum, the following may be
mentioned: Dr. Alés Hrdlicka, during his investigations among the Apaches and
Pimas of Arizona in the spring of 1905, obtained an important series of ethno-
logical specimens, and Dr. Frederick W. True made several short trips to near-by
places in Maryland and Virginia for the purpose of securing remains of the
cetaceans which occurred in this region during the Cretaceous period. Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger and Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., collected animals and plants in
Switzerland, France, and Italy during the summer of 1904. Mr. Robert Ridg-
way, who was in Costa Rica from November, 1904, to June, 1905, obtained a
large series of the birds of that country, and was instrumental in securing
tt most important donation from the national museum at San José. Dr. W. L.
Ralph visited the Dismal Swamp, Virginia, and the Adirondack region of New
York, while Mr. Barton A. Bean collected in Carroll County, western Maryland.
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Dr. F. V. Coville, while engaged in field work for the Department of Agricul-
ture in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico, obtained many plants which have
since been transferred to the Museum, and Prof. O. F. Cook made botanical
collections in Guatemala. Mr. W. R. Maxon was in Jamaica during the first
part of the year, and later, accompanied by Mr. Robert Hay, in Guatemala under
detail to the Department of Agriculture. In June, 1905, Dr. J. N. Rose, with
Mr. Joseph H. Painter, left on a collecting trip to Mexico, which will be con-
tinued during the summer.

The Department of Geology was enriched from several localities through
cooperative work with the United States Geological Survey, participated in by Dr.
George P. Merrill, and Dr. R. 8. Bassler; and in June Mr. Charles W. Gilmore
accompanied one of the field parties of the Survey to New Mexico, where he ob-
tained a small but interesting series of fossil vertebrates. ;

Researches.—The classified arrangement of the collections prescribed by
law calls for a large amount of research work in the study and naming of speci-
mens, although a greater or less proportion of the material received has already
been identified. A full compliance with this requirement has at no time been
possible, since the attention of the scientific staff on its past and present basis
has been mainly absorbed in the mere care and preservation of the collections,
and the maintenance of the exhibition features. Much help is obtained, how-
ever, from the scientific men of other institutions, many of whom are interested
in one or other of the subjects represented in the Museum, and they may visit
Washington or have collections sent to them for the purposes of investigation.
The results of most of the inquiries conducted in the Museum laboratories are
only indicated in the manuscript records, which are virtually a descriptive
history of the national collections, constantly in progress, but the working up of
a collection from any particular locality or region, or of a group of objects,
large or small, may lead to a positive contribution to knowledge, meriting dis-
semination through the medium of publication. Some of the more important
investigations of the past year, both by assistants of the Museum and by others,
have been as follows:

In the Department of Anthropology, Dr. Walter Hough began a detailed
study of the very extensive Pueblo collections, continued his observations upon
the primitive uses of fire, and nearly completed a report on the Hopi Indians
of Arizona. The collections in archeology were utilized by Mr. W. H. Holmes
in preparing subjects and illustrations for the Handbook of North American
Indians and by Dr. J. W. Fewkes in working up the results of his recent
archeological explorations in the Antillian region. Several lines of research
in physical anthropology occupied the attention of Dr. Alés Hrdliéka, and a
paper descriptive of the Howland loan collection of Buddhist religious art
was written by Dr. I. M. Casanowicz.

In the Department of Biology, Dr. F. W. True prepared a diagnosis of the
fossil skull of a new genus and species of sea lion from Oregon and began a
report on the collection of ziphioid whales in the Museum. Mr. Gerrit. S.
Miller, jr., spent several months at the natural history museums of London,
Paris, Berlin, and Leiden in completing his studies and identifications of the
very extensive Hast Indian collection of mammals belonging to the National
Museum and of material from other regions. Dr. H. A. Mearns, while in Wash-
ington during the winter, studied and described the unique collection of
mammals and birds which he brought from the Philippines and completed
the first part of his report on the mammals obtained in connection with the
Mexican boundary survey.

Mr. Robert Ridgway continued the preparation of his monograph on the
birds of North and Middle America. The birds obtained by Dr. W. L. Abbott
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. St

on the islands off the west coast of Sumatra were the subject of study by Dr.
Charles H. Richmond, and those secured by the same explorer in Kilimanjaro
and the China Sea by Mr. H. C. Oberholser, of the Biological Survey. Mr.
J. H. Riley reported on a collection from the islands of Antigua and Barbuda.
Mr. Barton A. Bean, in conjunction with Dr. C. H. Eigenmann, of Indiana
University, worked up the specimens of fishes brought from the Amazon
River by Prof. J. B. Steere in 1901. The Characinidz have been referred to
Doctor EHigenmann, and the Pacific deep-sea fishes are being studied by Dr.
C. H. Gilbert, of Leland Stanford Junior University.

Dr. W. H. Dall completed a revision of the land and fresh-water mollusks
of North America north of latitude 49°, a review of the classification of the
American Cyclostomatidze, and papers on land and fresh-water shells from the
Bahamas and Central America. He also has in progress reports on the
Pyramidellidze, in joint authorship with Dr. Paul Bartsch; and on recent
eollections from the Bureau of Fisheries. Dr. William H. Ashmead has about
completed his work on the superfamily-Formicoidea or ants, and Mr. D. W.
Coquillett has been engaged upon a monograph of the North American mos-
quitoes. Miss M. J. Rathbun prepared for the Bureau of Fisheries two reports
on Brachyura and Macrura, collected at the Hawaiian Islands and in Alaska,
and continued her studies on the fresh-water crabs. Dr. Harriet Richardson
completed a comprehensive monograph of the North American Isopods, and
Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan gave much time to the madreporarian corals.

Dr. J. N. Rose reports satisfactory progress with his researches on the flora
of Mexico and on the Crassulacez and Cactaceze of North America. Mr. William
R. Maxon prepared several papers on ferns, and Mr. J. H. Painter studied the
Mexican species of Meibomia. Capt. John Donnell Smith, associate in botany,
continued his investigations and the printing of his extensive work, and Dr.
EK. L. Greene, under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, began upon an
important paper to be entitled “ Landmarks of Botanical History.”

Dr. George P. Merrill completed a contribution to a history of American
geology and conducted observations on the origin of asbestiform serpentine
and the weathering of building stones. Research work in mineralogy was
mainly confined to the study of the structure of meteorites by Mr. Wirt Tassin.
Dr. R. S. Bassler submitted a paper on the Bryozoa of the Rochester Shales.
The report of Dr. Anton Handlirsch, of Vienna, on the Paleozoic insects repre-
sented in the Museum collection was received during the year and will soon
be published. An important work, sent to press before the close of the year,
was a catalogue of the type specimens of fossil invertebrates contained in the
collections of the Museum.

In Paleobotany, Prof. Lester F. Ward completed the second part of his mono-
graph on the status of the Mesozoic floras of the United States. Mr. David White
has made extensive use of the Lacoe collection in the preparation of a report
on the stratigraphic succession of the Pottsville floras in the basins of the
Appalachian trough, while Dr. F. H. Knowlton has been engaged upon the
fiora of the Laramie group and in the study of material from Alaska.

Distribution and exchange of duplicate specimens.—Duplicate invertebrate
fossils to the number of some 60,000 specimens, gradually segregated from the
reserve series during the progress of researches, were prepared for the use of
educational institutions, being made up into several hundred sets. There also
remained on hand for the same purpose a few sets of fishes, marine inverte-
brate animals, and geological specimens illustrating rock weathering and soil
formation. Of these several. collections, which are recognized as very helpful
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in connection with science teaching in the higher schools and colleges, 121,
aggregating over 14,000 specimens, were distributed during the year. In making
exchanges with scientific establishments and individuals about the same num-
ber of duplicate specimens were utilized, but as an equivalent is obtained in
these transactions they directly benefit the collections.

Exhibition halls—The crowded state of the exhibition halls prevents any
extensive additions to the public collections, but specimens are frequently
received which are deemed of sufficient importance to replace others that have
been for some time on display, and the installations in all branches are being
constantly improved. In ethnology the interesting Malaysian collection of Dr.
W. L. Abbott and Philippine collection of Dr. E. A. Mearns were substituted for
some of the older material from Polynesia; the basketry collection was rear-
ranged and several conspicuous examples of the handiwork of the Indians of
southern Alaska were installed. To the exhibition in historic archeology were
added a series of biblical gems, coins of the Bible, oriental manuscripts, ete.
The entire collection of prehistoric archeology, occupying the large upper hall of
the Smithsonian building, recently renovated, is being thoroughly revised and
will soon again be opened to the public. The exhibits in technology received
some interesting accessions, especially in the lines of electrical apparatus, fire-
arms, and railroad appliances. In the gallery of ceramics the collection of
purely artistic ware in porcelain, glass, lacquer, and metal work was arranged
by countries in a series of separate cases.

The most important additions in biology consisted of objects which had been
obtained and prepared for the Museum display at the Louisiana Purchase
Hxposition, including a number of large exotic mammals, the skeleton and
east of the exterior of a sulphur-bottom whale about SO feet long, accurately
eolored casts of several large snakes, and a fine set of models of deep-sea
fishes. The American faunal exhibit of insects was nearly completed, and the
synoptic series of marine invertebrates was enlarged. A number of large exam-
ples of important rocks and ores, besides several minerals and gems, were
added to the collections in geology, but the most noteworthy feature was a
skeleton of the great fossil Dinosaurian reptile, Triceratops prorsus, consisting
chiefly of the actual bones of this Cretaceous monster, the few missing parts
being reproduced in plaster. It stands 8 feet 2 inches high and measures
19 feet 8 inches long.

Visitors.—The Museum building was visited during the year by 235,921 per-
sons, and the Smithsonian building by 149,380 persons, making an average
daily attendance of 753 at the former and of 477 at the latter.

Mectings and lectures.—The lecture hall was used during the last half of the
year for several important functions. On March 9, 1905, the Hon. Andrew D.
White delivered, before a distinguished audience, the first lecture under the
Hamilton fund of the Smithsonian Institution, his subject being “‘The diplo-
matic seryice of the United States, with some hints toward its reform.” On
March 25 occurred the commencement exercises of the United States Naval
Medical School, the President of the United States being present and delivering
the diplomas to the graduates. Saturday afternoon lectures on zoological and
botanical subjects were ziven there from March 18 to April 22, under the
auspices of the Biological Society of Washington, the speakers being Dr. Albert
Mann, Dr. L. O. Howard, Dr. A. D. Hopkins, Dr. George T. Moore, Mr. William
L. Underwood, and Dr. I’. W. True.

The regular annual session of the National Academy of Sciences was held
from April 18 to 20, the lecture hall being used for the public meetings and the
office of the Assistant Secretary for business purposes, and on May 3 the hall
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

was occupied, for one of its daily sessions, by the American Institute of Mining
Engineers, then holding its annual meeting in Washington.

Publications.—The publications issued during the past year comprised the
Annual Report of the National Museum for 1903; volume 3 of Bulletin No. 50,
forming the third part of Mr. Robert Ridgway’s monograph of the ‘“ Birds of
- North and Middle America; part 4 of volume 8 of “ Contributions from the
National Herbarium,” entitled “Studies of Mexican and Central American
Plants, No. 4,” by Dr..J. N. Rose; volume 9 of the same series, composed of a
single paper on “ The Useful Plants of the Island of Guam,” by Mr. William E.
Safford; and the greater part of volume 28 of the Proceedings of the Museum.
The General Appendix to the Report for 1903 comprised two papers, one by the
Assistant Secretary, entitled “The United States National Museum: An
Account of the Buildings Occupied by the National Collections,’ the other by
Dr. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden, entitled “ Studies of the Museums and Kindred
Institutions of New York City, Albany, Buffalo, and Chicago, with Notes on some
Huropean Institutions.”

Library.—TVhe working library of the Museum now contains about 24,170
bound volumes and 38,645 unbound papers, the additions during the past year
having comprised 3,573 books, 3,048 pamphlets, and 563 parts of volumes. It
is chiefly dependent on exchanges for its increases, but a large share of the
books required for the classification of the collections are not to be obtained in
this way, and the $2,000 annually appropriated by Congress is entirely inade-
quate to supply even the most important demands in this respect.

Hxpositions—The exhibit made by the Museum, in conjunction with the
other bureaus of the Institution, formed one of the especially noteworthy feat-
ures of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, at St. Louis, Mo., which closed on
December 2, 1904. Arrangements were then begun for the Lewis and Clark
Exposition, at Portland, Oreg., which opened on June 1, and is to continue until
October 15, 1905. Dr. Frederick W. True was designated as the representative
of the Institution and Museum, and Dr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., as chief special
agent. The exhibit for Portland, which had necessarily to be planned upon a
much smaller scale than the one at St. Louis, was made up almost entirely of
selections from the latter, though a few novelties were added.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905, in
accordance with the act of Congress making provision “for continuing ethno-
logical researches among the American Indians, under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution,’ approved April 28, 1904.

The work of the Bureau has been conducted in accordance with the plan of
operations approved by the Secretary June 17, 1904. The systematic re-
searches have been carried forward by the seven members of the Bureau’s
scientific staff, assisted by a large number of associates and collaborators who
have been called on to prepare papers on special subjects or to conduct investi-
gations for which their qualifications especially fitted them. During the year

«seven members and associates of the Bureau have made researches in the field,
the regions visited including Maryland, Virginia, Oklahoma, Indian Territory,
Arizona, New. Mexico, Oregon, and Mexico.

The amount of field work has been somewhat curtailed by the necessity of
detaining a number of the ethnologists in the office to assist in the completion
of the Handbook of the Indians (hitherto referred to as the Cyclopedia or
Dictionary of the Indian Tribes), which was designed to be submitted to the
Secretary at the close of the year. The enlargement of the scope of the work
to include not only descriptions of the tribes and their settlements, but also
popular articles covering the whole range of ethnological and archeological
research relating to them, greatly increased the amount of investigation re-
quired, but the value of the Handbook as a work of reference has been more than
proportionately increased. With the view of revising and unifying the great
number of articles designed for introduction into the Handbook a committee of
revision was organized, consisting of members of the Bureau and all available
resident anthropologists, fourteen in all, who met three times each week to
discuss the papers presented. The meetings of this committee proved both
interesting and profitable, and suggested the advisability of holding similar
meetings hereafter for the discussion of current researches of the Bureau.

As a result of the preparation of the papers for the Handbook, covering, as
they do, the entire range of Indian ethnology and administration, the researches
conducted in the office during the year have been exceptionally comprehensive ;
every branch of anthropologic research, including somatology, psychology,
linguistics, sociology, religion, technology, and ssthetics, has received such con-
sideration as the comprehensive though necessarily brief articles for the Hand-
book required. Besides the articles treating of these primary departments of
research, many others have been prepared, on the various phases of the history,
archeology, biography, and education of the Indians and the administration of
their affairs. With the exception of the bibliography and index, which were
retained: for reference in proof reading, the manuscript for the Handbook, ac-
companied with about 800 illustrations, was submitted to the Secretary July 1.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. A]

Under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution the Chief visited Europe
for the purpose of attending the International Congress of Americanists, held
at Stuttgart, Germany, beginning August 18, 1904. In addition to representing
the Smithsonian Institution, he served as delegate of two other scientific organi-
zations, and was also designated by the Department of State as the official
representative at the congress of the United States Government. As a mem-
ber of the scientific staff of the National Museum he was intrusted with
the additional commission of visiting a number of the principal museums of
Hurope for the purpose of acquiring information to be utilized in the erection
and furnishing of the new National Museum building. On July 26 the Chief
sailed from New York in company with Mr. J. R. Marshall, of the firm of
Hornblower & Marshall, architects of the new building, and reached Plymouth,
England, August 1. Nine days were spent in visiting the museums of London,
Oxford, and Cambridge, and eight days in similar observations in Paris, and
on August 18 Stuttgart was reached. ‘The opening session of the Congress
of Americanists was held in the forenoon of that day and was attended by a
large number of members and other prominent persons, including His Majesty,
King William II, of Wurttemberg, who, in response to the address of the
president of the congress, Prof. Karl von den Steinen, expressed at length
his appreciation of the aims and work of the congress, and his pleasure at
having the session held in his capital city.

A report of the last meeting of the congress, held at New wade City in 1902,
was presented by Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist of the Bureau, and
other routine business was transacted. Members of the congress were invited
to take luncheon with the King at his suburban palace, which was followed by a
reception in the palace gardens. The King’s interest was highly appreciated
and contributed much to the success of the congress. During the presence of
the Americanists receptions were also held by Count von Linden, vice-president
of the congress, and by Mr. Edward N. Ozmun, United States consul at
Stuttgart. Sessions were held on August 19, 20, 22, 25, and 24, and a large
number of papers, dealing in the main with questions of American history,
ethnology, and archeology, were read. On the 20th the Chief of the Bureau of
American Ethnology delivered an address on ‘ Contributions of American
Archeology to Human History,’ and at its close he presented to the congress
a set of 75 bound volumes, relating chiefly to American archeology and ethnology,
published by the Smithsonian Institution and two of its bureaus—the National
Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology—for which the president
extended the thanks of the congress. The Chief also presented a series of 66
photographs of American Indians, representing delegations which visited Wash-
ington during the winter of 1908-4, the series having been taken cojointly by
the Bureau of American Hthnology and the National Museum. Various excur-
sions were made to points of interest, the principal being to Schaffhausen,
Switzerland, to visit the sites of Dr. J. Nuesch’s recent explorations of the
tamous lake-dwelling stations at Schweizerbild and Ioenigsbau.

_-After the adjournment of the congress, the Chief proceeded to Dresden, where,
under the guidance of Dr. A. B. Meyer, director of the Royal Zoological and
Anthropological Museum of Saxony, the various museums of that city were
examined. After leaving Dresden, a number of cities in Germany, Holland, and
Belgium were visited with a view to museum study, and on August 12 he re-
turned to Paris, and on the 25th sailed from Cherbourg, en route for New York.
Between the date of his arrival in Plymouth, August 1, and his departure from
Paris, September 25, the Chief of the Bureau visited and made studies of up-
ward of 50 museums. ‘T'hese observations are embodied in a separate report
submitted to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,

sm 1905——7
42, REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
RESEARCH WORK.

Shortly after his return from Hurope in September, the Chief found it neces-
sary to undertake the preparation of a number of articles relating to aboriginal
art and archeology for the Handbook of the Indians. Among the subjects
treated at some length are archeology, architecture, art, antiquity, Bureau of
American Ethnology, bonework, catlinite, cliff-dwellings, copper, engraving,
graphic art, mines and quarries, metal work, ornament, pottery, sculpture, shell-
heaps, shellwork, and stonework. The only field work undertaken by the Chief
during the year was a brief visit to Cavetown, Md., for the purpose of observ-
ing the exploration there being conducted by Dr. Charles Peabody and Mr.
W. K. Moorehead in the well-known cave near that village. Mr. J. D. McGuire
had begun the exploration of this cave for the Carnegie Institution in 1903
and had obtained valuable evidence of its former occupancy by Indians.
The present work, which consisted of extensive excavations within the outer
chamber of the cavern, yielded much additional material of the same general
character.

During the first few weeks of the year Mr. James Mooney, ethnologist, was
at St. Louis supervising the final installation of the Kiowa heraldry exhibit
in the Smithsonian section of the Government building, Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. This exhibit comprised about 120 articles, filling 50 feet of wall
ease, together with one floor case, and consisted of 90 small shield models, 4
original shields, 5 tipi models, 6 paintings on buckskin, with several cere-
monial lances and smaller objects. On the completion of this work, after a
brief leave of absence, Mr. Mooney returned to Mount Scott, in the Kiowa
country, Oklahoma, where he continued his researches, including the prepara-
tion of models and the collection of ethnological material. A number of
Cheyenne tipi models were also made for the Field Columbian Museum, of
Chicago, with funds provided by that institution, as authorized by joint ar-
rangement with the Bureau. At the end of October Mr. Mooney returned to
Washington and was engaged in writing a preliminary paper on Kiowa heraldry
until about the end of the calendar year, when he was called on to cooperate
in the preparation of the Handbook of the Indians, for which work the following
articles were furnished: Arawakan colony, Calusa tribe, Cheyenne tribe,
Kiowa tribe, military societies, peyote, population, shields, skin-dressing, sig-
nals, sign language, Timucua tribe. Besides these about 100 minor articles were
prepared, treating of tribes, biographies of noted Indians, and other subjects.
In connection with this work the available information relating to the ancient
tribes of Florida and the Gulf States generally was found to be so deficient
and confused that Mr. Mooney undertook an investigation of the subject from
original sources. A part of the results has been embodied in the Handbook of
the Indians, and the foundation has been laid for an extended paper on the
ethnology of this region to form a complement to his previous studies of the
Siouan tribes of the east and the Cherokee. In the meantime he also super-
vised the photographing of the large series of shield models and other parts of
the heraldry collection made by him during previous years, and prepared cata-
logues and labels for such portions of this material as were required for the
Bureau exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Exposition.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, ethnologist, spent the first six months of the year in
the completion of the text of his monograph on the Aborigines of Porto Rico.
He left Washington on January 7, 1905, for an extended archeological trip to
the Republic of Mexico, under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, and
returned on the 15th of May. About three weeks were spent by Doctor
Fewkes in the City of Mexico making arrangements with officials for letters
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

to those who could aid him in the prosecution of his studies. While not thus
engaged at the capital his time was profitably employed in studying the col-
lections in the Museo Nacional and one or two private collections, and in
making several excursions to places of archeological interest in the neighbor-
hood of the city, including several of the ruins near Lake Tezcoco, as well as
those at Iztapalapa and at San Juan Teotihuacan. While awaiting letters of
introduction from the President to the governors of Veracruz and Tamaulipas,
Doctor Fewkes visited Cuernavaca, where he made photographs of the so-called
“Victory stone,” or chimalli, the pictograph of the eagle, and the famous stone
lizard, and made a trip also to the ruins of Nochicalco and Tepotzlan. From
the ruin known as Casa del Tepozteco he obtained copies of inscriptions on
the raised seat in the inner room.

After receiving the necessary letters through the courtesy of President Diaz,
Doctor Fewkes proceeded to Xalapa, in the State of Vera Cruz, which he made
the base of operations during February, March, and a part of April. While in
that city considerable time was devoted to an examination of the magnificent
collection of Governor Dehesa, as well as the collection of Senora Estafania and
others. The vicinity of Xalapa was found to be particularly rich in ruins and
mounds, among which are those at Coatepec, Bandarilla, and Xalapa Viejo.
An excursion was made also to Texolo, where there are thirteen or more large
mounds, some of which are evidently the remains of temples of an old Totonac
city. Xico Viejo, an undescribed ruin of a Nahuatl garrison town mentioned
by Bernal Diaz and Gomara, was also visited in the mountains near the trail
taken by Cortés from the coast to the City of Mexico in 1519. Instructive
photographs of this ruin were taken, and notes made on the idols and pottery
found in the neighborhood.

Doctor Fewkes made two visits to the ruins of Cempoala, about 20 miles
from the city of Vera Cruz. On the first visit he was accompanied by an
official representative of Governor Dehesa, by the alcalde of San Carlos, a
neighboring town, and by the inspector and owner of the ruins. On the second
trip, when he spent a week at the ruins, Governor Dehesa kindly permitted him
to employ the services of the State photographer, Senor Ximines.

At the close of March Doctor Fewkes visited the old city of Villa Rica de la
Vera Cruz, now called Antigua, founded by Cortés. In the neighborhood of this
city but on the opposite side of the river he found many mounds indicating the
site of a large prehistoric city. Other ruins were observed at Santa Fe.

Doctor Fewkes examined some of the antiquities about Cordova and Orizaba ;
he also visited the pyramid of Cholula near Puebla, and about the middle of
April proceeded to the State of Tamaulipas, spending about three weeks at
Tampico in a study of the numerous ruins along the Panuco and Tamise
rivers and on the adjacent lagoons, and in visiting the extensive shell heaps
and temple mounds a mile east of Tampico and others not far from the
site of the old town, Tampico Viejo. Doctor Fewkes found numerous antiquities
at Altamira and mounds on the banks of the Champayan lagoon. Many other
evidences of former occupancy, as idols, pottery, stone weapons, and ornaments,
were seen in this region. The old city of Chila, destroyed by Cortés, situated
about 10 miles west of Tampico, was found to be hidden in a forest. Evidences
of temples and burial mounds also occur abundantly in this locality. About 50
Photographs of bowls, jars, and idols found in the neighborhood of Panuco,
Tampico, and the lagoons along the banks of the Tamise River, were made. Of
more than usual interest are those of large stone idols at Altamira and in the
courtyard of a house in Tampico.

On his return to Washington Doctor Fewkes continued the study from his
notes and photographs, and prepared a general account of his visit to Cempoala
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and Xicochimaleo, which was transmitted for publication by the Smithsonian
Institution. The illustrative material brought back includes about 200 large
photographic negatives, numerous smaller views, tracings of pictographs, and
many drawings, plans, and maps.

Dr. Cyrus Thomas, ethnologist, was engaged during the year largely on the
Handbook of the Indians, assisting Mr. Hodge in the laborious task of prepar-
ing the manuscripts for publication. Among the articles written by Doctor
Thomas during the year for this work are agriculture, calendar, counting, Five
Civilized Tribes, fortifications, habitations, maize, migrations, mortuaTy cus-
toms, mounds and mound builders, population, reservations, treaties, besides a
number of biographical sketches and archeological articles of a more special
character. The work of reading the proofs of Bulletin 28, which required
especial acquaintance with archeology and glyphic systems of the ancient
Mexicans, was also intrusted to Doctor Thomas. This reading was completed
before the end of the year. Doctor Thomas was also frequently called on for
data required in official correspondence relating to his special branches of
research.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, at the beginning of the year began the prepara-
tion of various articles for the Handbook of the Indians, and continued the
correction and elaboration of the material pertaining to the Iroquoian stock
for the same work. Among the articles furnished are those on adoption,
clans and gentes, confederations, chiefs, government, mythology, religion, scalp-
ing, wampum, and women. The work of cataloguing the collection of linguistic
manuscripts, of which Mr. Hewitt is custodian, was completed as far as copy-
ing the old cards in duplicate, when the work was laid aside for that of
the Handbook. Mr. Hewitt also gaye material assistance in furnishing data
required in the correspondence of the Bureau relating to tribes and languages.

Mrs. M. CG. Stevenson, ethnologist, spent the month of July in New Mexico,
where she had been for some months making a study of the arts, industries,
religion, and social customs of the Zuni tribe. It was observed that the Zuni
pantheon is largely similar to that of the Hopi and the Rio Grande pueblos.
Although the Zuni worship numerous deities which take both human and bes-
tial form, they believe also in a supreme power without form, yet embracing
all form, the breath of life—life itself. These beliefs indicate that the Zuni
have reached a higher stage of culture than has previously been supposed,
although it can not yet be said to what extent this may be attributed to the
Spanish influence to which the tribe was more or less subjected for three
centuries. Various details relating to Zuni life were investigated, and valu-
able information regarding mortuary customs was obtained through the death
and burial of Naiuchi, a celebrated priest-chief, whose demise occurred during
Mrs. Stevenson’s stay in Zuni pueblo. Native plants entering into the medicine
and dietary of the Zuni were also studied; the arts of preparing and dyeing
wool, which have not. been practiced for many years, were observed, and speci-
mens of the native materials and devices employed in the process, as well as of
the dyed wool, were collected. Studies of symbolism as embodied in Zuni
textile and ceramic art, and investigations into the everyday life, and especially
the child-life, of the pueblo were likewise made.

Harly in August a day was spent by Mrs. Stevenson with the Santa Clara
Indians in making a series of photographs of their annual fiesta. The month
was occupied principally, however, in a study of the Sia Indians, a few days
being given to the neighboring Jemez pueblo. On the 27th Mrs. Stevenson
reached Cochiti, whence a visit was made to the great stone carving of
cougars on the mesa 10 miles distant. In Mrs, Stevenson’s comparative studies

these sculptures are of special interest, as they are referred to in some of the
most sacred myths of the Zuni. The first of September was employed in a
visit to the cavate and mesa ruins about 12 miles from Santa Clara and in
making observations among the Tewa people of San Ildefonso, Santa Clara,
and San Juan pueblos. The religious beliefs, rituals, and daily customs of
these people were found to be closely allied to those of Zuni, difference in lan-
guage alone indicating that distinct peoples are involved. In October Mrs.
Stevenson returned to Washington, where she has since been engaged in the
revision of proofs of her memoir on the Zuni Indians, in the Twenty-third
Annual Report, and, as opportunity afforded, in the elaboration of her several
studies on Zuni religious beliefs, on the edible and medicinal plants of Zufi,
on symbolism as embodied in the textile and ceramic arts, and on the dyeing
of textile fabrics. od

Dr. J. R. Swanton, ethnologist, was engaged during the year in copying and
preparing for the press material obtained by him among the Tlingit Indians
of Alaska during the winter of 1903-4. This work, as completed, consists of 137
pages treating of the general ethnology of the Tlingit peoples, 20 native texts
with interlinear and free translations, the words of about 100 songs, with
translations, together with English versions of 88 stories obtained at Sitka and
Wrangell—altogether forming 900 typewritten pages. Doctor Swanton has
also prepared grammatical accounts of the Dakota, Haida, and Tlingit lan-
guages for introduction into the Handbook of Indian Languages now in course
of preparation under the direction of Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist of
the Bureau; and he has also been called on to contribute several articles for
the Handbook of the Indians, including kinship, names and naming, priests
and priesthood, thunderbird, totem poles, secret societies, and social organiza-
tion.

Dr. A. S. Gatschet, ethnologist, continued his work on certain unfinished lin-
guistic studies which it was hoped could be completed for publication before
his failing health made further progress impossible, but in January he was
compelled to practically relinquish his efforts, and on March 13 was placed on
furlough.

Barly in the year arrangements were made with the United States National
Museum to have Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, curator of physical anthropology in the
Museum, visit Arizona and New Mexico on behalf of the Bureau for the purpose
of making physical, physiological, and medical observations among the Apache
and Pima Indians. Leaving Washington on January 20, Doctor Hrdlicka began
his studies, five days later, on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, where he re-
mained until February 8, when he visited a group of Apache residing near what
is known as the Sawmill, in the Black River Region. From this point he re-
turned to San Carlos, and on February 13 reached the Rice Station Apache
School and district, situated farther northeast on the reservation. On February
26, Doctor Hrdlicka endeavored to reach the White Mountain branch of the
Apache, but was prevented from doing so by exceptionally heavy rains. On
March 1 he was able to proceed to Sacaton, Ariz.,where studies of the Pima tribe
were made. From March 12 to 16 he was at Casa Blanca. On the latter date he
returned to Casa Grande, and thence proceeded to El Paso, Tex., reaching the
reservation of the Mescalero Apache in New Mexico on the 19th. After remain-
ing six days with the Mescaleros, Doctor Hrdlicka began his return journey,
reaching Washington March 31.

Doctor Hrdlicka’s researches were conducted with the object of supple-
menting his former investigations among the same tribes. As much attention as
possible was deyoted to the children, from birth onward, the number examined
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

being nearly 1,000. Other important subjects to which study was especially
devoted were fecundity, mortality, native foods, hygiene, disease, and curative
means and methods. These studies were greatly facilitated by the officials of
the Indian Office, and met with little objection on the part of the Indians.

In addition to his direct anthropologic investigations, Doctor Hrdlicka sue-
ceeded in gathering specimens of about 150 medicinal and food plants and a
number of ethnological objects. He procured one Apache skull and five complete
Apache skeletons, and in addition to making observations of value among the
ancient ruins of the general region, obtained many archeological specimens from
hitherto unexplored ruins in the San Carlos Valley.

In April, Mr. E. L. Hewett, who was engaged during the winter months in
preparing for the Bureau an archeological map of Colorado and New Mexico,
was commissioned to proceed to New Mexico for the purpose of making ex-
tended researches among the ancient ruins of the so-called Pajarito Plateau
district. His first work was the investigation of numerous deserted and ruined
pueblos of the Tewa tribes. This was followed by excavations of ancient
mounds in Otowi Canyon, which yielded results of exceptional interest. Up-
ward of 175 burials were uncovered, and the osseous remains of more than 100
individuals were collected and forwarded for study in the National Museum.
The art remains comprise numerous entire earthenware vessels and many frag-
ments, with a fair complement of implements of bone and stone. Mr. Hewett
was fortunate in reaching this arid spot in an exceptionally wet season, as he
found water within easy reach. At the close of the year he had completed his
studies within the boundaries of Pajarito Plateau and was preparing to explore
explore the plateaus and mountains to the west and the Jemez Valley beyond.

In June a report reaching the Bureau that important finds of prehistoric
remains of man and art had been-made on the site of the forthcoming James-
town Exposition, near Norfolk, Va., Mr. J. D. McGuire was commissioned to
visit the locality and report on the character of the discoveries made. Mr.
McGuire spent one day on the exposition grounds collecting such information as
was available, and later reported that although traces of human remains had
been exposed in the excavations of the exposition company, the reports had been
greatly exaggerated, the discoveries being meager and uniform in character
with the relies of countless other sites in the Chesapeake-Potomae region.

The work of Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist, was confined to the prepa-
ration of the Handbook of American Languages which has been under way for
several years. The main part of the field work for the first part of the Hand-
book was closed during the present year and some field work designed to be
embodied in the second part was taken up. Doctor Boas also furnished the
article on languages for the Handbook of the Indians.

In the course of the fiscal year the following manuscripts for the Handbook
of American Languages have been submitted.

1. Dr. P. E. Goddard: Grammatical notes on the Hupa (Athapasean stock).

2. Dr. A. L. Kroeber: Grammatical notes on the Yuki (Yukian stock).

3. Dr. Roland B. Dixon: Grammatical notes on the Maidu (Pujunan stock).

4. Dr. William Jones: Grammatical notes on the Sauk and Fox (Algonquian
stock).

5. Dr. John R. Swanton: Grammatical notes on the Dakota (Siouan stock).

6. Dr. John R. Swanton: Grammatical notes on the Haida (Skittagetan
stock ).

7. Dr. John R. Swanton: Grammatical notes on the Tlingit (I<oluschan stock).

8 Dr. Franz Boas: Grammatical notes on the Kwakiutl (Wakashan stock).

9. Dr. Franz Boas: Grammatical notes on the Chinook (Chinookan stock).
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

The following manuscripts are still outstanding :
1. J. N. B. Hewitt: Grammatical notes on the Iroquois (Iroquoian stock).

2. Dr. Franz Boas: Grammatical notes on the Eskimo (Eskimauan stock).

3. Dr. Franz Boas: Grammatical notes on the Tsimshian (Chimmesyan stock).

During the year the grammatical notes on the Shoshoni by Mr. H. H. St.
Clair, 2d, have been revised.

The general plan of the Handbook of Languages has undergone no material
change, except in so far as it was deemed advisable to add briefer articles on the
grammar of the remaining languages of the northern part of the continent.
These are the Tlingit, the Salish, the Kutenai, and the Chemakum. It is
also deemed advisable to add a sketch of one of the coast languages of Oregon
which was collected during the year 1904-5 by Mr. St. Clair, who submitted his
material on the Coosa and Takilma of Oregon during the present year.

It also seemed desirable to add some data relating to the formation of the
noun in Chinook, which seemed of importance in order to clear up some ques-
tions relating to the fundamental traits of that family of languages. Since all
our information on this stock is derived from one informant, it seemed essen-
tial to obtain additional material from other sources and from another dialect.
lor this reason preparations were made to send Mr. E. Sapir to the upper
Columbia River to make a study of the Wasco. In the preparation of this
work the Kathlamet Dictionary, based on Bulletin 26, was arranged and copied.

The work on the southern group of languages will require long and ener-
getic field work. So far only one of the languages of the Gulf States, the
- Yuchi, has been taken up, this tribe being selected because it seems most likely
to furnish material that will be not only of linguistic value but will afford
knowledege of the early history and customs of the Southeast. This work has
been intrusted to Mr. Frank G. Speck, who spent the summer of 1904 among the
Yuchi tribe and who returned to this field at the close of the fiscal year.

HANDBOOK OF THE INDIANS.

Work on the Handbook of the Indians. North of Mexico, hitherto frequently
referred to as the “ Dictionary of Indian Tribes,” has been vigorously prose-
cuted during the year under the immediate supervision of Mr. F. W. Hodge,
of the Smithsonian Institution, who, with the approval of the Secretary,
has devoted most of his time thereto. Mr. Hodge has had the almost undi-
vided assistance of Dr. Cyrus Thomas; and, as occasion required, nearly the
entire scientific staff of the Bureau has aided both in the preparation of
the anthropologic and kindred articles and in the revision and elaboration
of the tribal descriptions found to be necessary by reason of recently
acquired knowledge. So far as the funds of the Bureau: afforded, the aid of
ethnologists not officially connected with the Bureau was also enlisted. The
services generously rendered by these, either gratuitously or for merely a
nominal consideration, are highly appreciated.

As outlined in former reports it was originally the plan of Major Powell
to classify the linguistic families, tribes, and settlements north of Mexico
and to identify the various names by which these had been known in the
vast literature of the subject, with a brief description of each such group.
This material, recorded on many thousands of cards, became known as the
“ Cyclopedia of Tribes, with Synonymy.”

In 1903 the Secretary altered the scope of the work by directing the incor-
poration of brief separate articles pertaining to the habits, customs, arts, and
industries of the Indians, and of their dealings with the Government, together
with biographies of noted individuals and a list of words of northern Indian
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

origin that have been incorporated into the English language. No work so com-
prehensive in its scope had hitherto been attempted, consequently in making
plans for the new departure it became necessary to begin at the foundation. The
popular style of treatment was ever kept in mind, and considerable time was
consumed in correspondence with experts best qualified for the preparation of
many of the special articles called for by the enlarged plan. For these reasons
it has not been possible to complete the work at an earlier date. Owing to the
fact that many of the specialists do not reside in Washington, it was difficult,
within a limited time, to arrange for entire consistency in treatment and to
prevent repetition through encroachment of one subject on another when written
by many hands. On this account, and for the purpose of obtaining the views
and criticisms of as many experts as possible, conferences were held, as already
mentioned, three times each week, which were faithfully attended by the eth-
nologie staffs of the Bureau and the National Museum, as well as by other
resident ethnologists; and ethnologists from elsewhere, while visiting Washing-
ton, often gave this committee of revision the benefit of their criticism.

As the articles prepared both by the regular attendants and by others were
read at the conferences, and thus were accorded opportunity for criticsim,
the value of the meetings in promoting the authoritativeness of the forthcoming
Tlandbook is inestimable. New subjects were constantly suggested, and in some
instances much new light was shed on others, after having been written, by
reason of the personal knowledge of one or another of the critics present.

In addition to the special articles elsewhere mentioned ‘n this report as
prepared by members of the Bureau, the following are among the more impor-
tant of those that have been furnished by specialists not officially connected
With ate

The Bureau was also fortunate enough to have the services of Dr. A. L.
Kroeber, of the University of California, who generously revised the accu-
mulated material pertaining to many of the linguistic families of California,
and in addition gave much valuable information respecting the Shoshonean
and Yuman families and the Mission Indians. The remaining Californian
stocks were reviewed by Dr. P. E. Goddard, also of the University of California,
and by Dr. Roland B. Dixon, of Harvard University.

With the exception of a few articles that had not been quite finished by those
to whom the subjects were assigned, the manuscript of the body of the Hand-
hook, recorded on more than 40,000 cards, together with about SOO illustrations,
was submitted to the Secretary for transmittal to the Public Printer on July 1,
1905, for publication in two octavo volumes as Bulletin 30 of the Bureau.
These cards do not include about 37,000 cross-references to the tribal syn-
onyms, nor the bibliography, which are retained for use in reading the proofs
of the text. After serving this purpose they will be ready to be put in type to
appear at the close of the work.

ARCHEOLOGICAL MAP.

The work of compiling an archeological map of the United States, which
had received some attention in previous years, was carried forward with all
possible dispatch during the last year. The departments of the Government
having control of the public lands have undertaken to protect from despolia-
tion by commercial relic hunters and unskilled and unauthorized explorers
the archeological remains of these lands, and excellent progress in this direc-
tion has been made, especially by the Department of the Interior. For years
the Bureau has been collecting data relating to these remains, and whenever
ealled on has furnished all available information for the use of the depart-
ments in carrying out this laudable enterprise. During the winter months Mr.
J. D. McGuire was engaged in collecting and collating data relating to the
antiquities of Arizona and Utah, and in platting these on topographical maps
furnished by the United States Geological Survey; and Mr. BE. L. Hewett has
carried forward to practical completion a corresponding work in Colorado and
New Mexico. The several maps have been completed so far as the data is
at hand. Accompanying the maps is a card catalogue of the various sites,
giving information regarding location, character of remains, and explorations
previously carried on. These maps and catalogues are at the disposal of
the departments when called for.

In New Mexico the following sheets embrace 512 sites of sufficient interest
to be catalogued: Santa Fe, Santa Clara, San Pedro, Pajarito Park, Bernal,
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Las Vegas, Chaco Canyon, Mount Taylor, Largo, Lamy, Wingate, Jemez, Taos,
Tierra Amarilla, Quemado, Acoma, Manzano, Pinos Wells, Tularosa, Chloride,
San Marcial, Fort Stanton, Big Hatchet, Chama, El Paso, Fort Bayard, Las
Cruces, San Juan, Albuquerque, and Tres Hermanos. In Colorado the Mesa
Verde sheet alone includes 54 sites. On the 21 Arizona sheets (Tusayan, Fort
Defiance, San Francisco Mountain, Echo Cliff, St. Johns, Prescott, Verde,
Florence, Holbrook, Canyon de Chelly, Solomonsville, Globe, Phoenix, Casa
Grande, Fort Apache, Diamond Creek, Chino, Marsh Pass, Tombstone, and
Tucson) 270 sites are recorded, and on the Utah sheets (Ashley, Beaver,
Escalante, Fish Lake, Henry Mountain, Kanab, Manti, Salt Lake, San Rafael,
St. George, Price River, Uinta, La Salle, Abajo, and Utah) are noted 122 sites.
The 1,008 archeological sites thus catalogued are scattered over an immense
territory and come under the jurisdiction of the Interior, Agricultural, and
War departments.

EXPOSITION WORK.

The exhibit of the Bureau installed in the Smithsonian section of the Gov-
ernment building of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis during
1904, and described in the report for that year, was dismantled at the close of
the exposition and a large part of it transferred to Portland, where it has
been installed as a part of the Institution’s exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Ex-
position. The remainder of the material has been-returned to Washington and
deposited in the National Museum.

STUDY OF INDIAN DELEGATIONS.

The systematic study of visiting Indian delegations has been continued with
success. During the year 23 delegations, representing 21 tribes, have been
conducted, through the agency of Mr. Andrew John, to the Bureau and National
Museum laboratories. Upward of 280 portrait negatives have been made, and
casts and measurements of a number of individuals have been obtained. Few
Indians of the higher type, however, are willing to submit to the experience of
having the face encased in plaster. The tribes represented are as follow:

COLLECTIONS.

The ethnological collections obtained during the year fall considerably short
of those of previous years, owing to the reduced amount of field work undertaken.
“his condition was due, as already explained, to the necessity of keeping most

of the scientific staff in Washington to aid in the completion of the Handbook
of Indians. Tne accessions are a valuable collection, made by Mrs. M. C.
Stevenson at Zuni, a series of archeological objects obtained by Doctor Hrdlicka
in Arizona and New Mexico, and several minor collections, all of which have
been deposited in the National Museum.

PUBLICATIONS.

The distribution of publications has continued as in former years. The
great increase in the number of libraries in the country and the multiplication
of demands from the public generally have resulted in an almost immediate
exhaustion of the quota of volumes allotted to the Bureau, few copies of any of
the reports remaining six months after the date of issue. Part II of the Twenty-
second Annual Report was issued in January. During the year 1,591 copies
of the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Reports were sent to regular recipients,
and 2,000 volumes and pamphlets were transmitted in response to special
requests, presented largely by members of Congress. The proof reading of the
Twenty-third Annual and of Bulletin 28 was practically completed at the close
of the year, and it is expected that the press work of these publications will
shortly be begun. The Twenty-fourth Report was in the hands of the printer
before the close of the year, and Bulletins 29 and 30, the latter being the Hand-
book of the Indians, were ready to be submitted to the Secretary on June 30,
1905, while the Twenty-fifth Annual Report was completed, with the exception
of a small number of illustrations.

EDITORIAL WORK.

The editorial work of the year has presented features of exceptional diffi-
culty, on account of the large number of papers dealing with linguistics and
technical subjects. The Bureau has had the services of Mr. Frank Huntington
for the greater part of the year, and Mr. J. P. Sanborn, jr., received a proba-
tional appointment as editor in May. The reading of the proofs of Mrs.
Stevenson’s monograph on the Zuni Indians for the Twenty-third Annual
Report, a work of much technical difficulty, was intrusted mainly to Mr. I. G.
Farrell.

ILLUSTRATIONS.

The work of preparing illustrations has continued in charge of Mr. De-
Lancey Gill, who has been assisted, as heretofore, by Mr. Henry Walther.
The photographie work has included the making of portraits of members of 21
Indian delegations which visited the capital during the year. Three views of
each individual were taken, besides several group views, the negatives num-
bering 298. In preparing illustrations for the publications of the Bureau up-
ward of 200 negatives were made, and 156 films exposed in the field by members
of the Bureau were developed in the laboratory. During the year about 2,350
prints were made, mainly for immediate use in illustrating the Bureau publica-
tions. Illustrations prepared for the Twenty-fourth Annual Report number 45;
for the Twenty-fifth Annual Report, 128; for Bulletin 30, 800. Illustrations
transmitted with reports submitted to the Secretary for publication are: For
the Twenty-fourth Annual Report, 1,103; for Bulletin 30, 871. Illustrations
edited for the Twenty-third Annual Report number 25; for the Twenty-fourth
Annual Report, 1,102. The printed editions of 48 colored plates submitted by
the engravers for the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Annual Reports, num-
bering about 450,000 prints, were individually examined and approved or
rejected.
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

LIBRARY.

The library has been in immediate charge of Miss Ella Leary, who has had
the assistance of Mrs. Ella Slaughter. The accessioning and cataloguing of
the books, pamphlets, and periodicals received during the year have been kept
up to date, and the cataloguing of the publications of scientific societies has
been commenced. Owing to the crowded condition of the library and their
questionable place in an ethnological library, about 400 publications relating
to natural history, received through exchange, have been transferred to the
National Museum. During the year there have been received and recorded
898 volumes, 500 pamphlets, and the current issues of upward of 500 period-
icals: 120 volumes have been bound at the Government Printing Office. The
library now contains about 12,563 bound volumes, 7,000 pamphlets, and a large
number of periodicals bearing on ethnology and kindred topics. Purchase of
books for the library has been restricted to those that bear on the subject of
anthropology, with special reference to the American Indians, and only indis-
pensable works have been obtained by this means.

CLERICAL WORK,

The clerical force of the Bureau consists of four regular employees—Mr.
J. B. Clayton, head clerk; Miss Emilie R. Smedes and Miss May S. Clark, ste-
nographers; and Miss Ella Leary, clerk and acting librarian. During the year
the compilation of the Handbook of the Indians necessitated the employment of
additional clerks with special training in dealing with cyclopedic material and
in bibliographic work. In this the services of Mrs. F. S. Nichols, Mrs. Gertrude
L. Rogers, and Miss Laura W. Steever have proved invaluable.

PROPERTY.

The property of the Bureau is comprised in seven classes, as follow: Office
furniture and appliances; field outfits; linguistic and ethnological manuscripts
and other documents ; photographs, drawings, paintings, and engravings; a work-
ing library; collections held temporarily by collaborators for use in research,
and undistributed residue of the editions of Bureau publications.

The additions to the property of the Bureau for the year include a typewriter
and a few necessary articles of furniture. The only improvement made in the
offices was the changing of the electric-light wiring, which was done under the
direction of the District authorities at a cost of $116.55

REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of
the International Hxchange Service during the year ending June 30, 1905:

The system for the interchange of publications between learned institutions
and individuals in the United States and those in other countries was inaugu-
rated by the Smithsonian Institution almost at the very beginning, and was
“maintained at the expense of the private fund of the Institution exclusively
from 1850 to 1881, when Congress made a small appropriation to assist in the
work. Since that time Congressional appropriations have been made annually,
but at no time have they been large enough to provide for the entire expense of
the service, the Institution having supplied all other necessary means from its
private fund, with the aid of United States departments and bureaus and
State institutions, which have been asked to reimburse the Institution, at the
uniform rate of 5 cents per pound, for a part of the expense of preparing, boxing,
and transporting contributions.

The number of packages dispatched during the year was greater than ever
before, and, as a record of every package is required, the work has been
considerably augmented, but there has been no increase in the clerical force.

The offices occupied by the Exchange Service, consisting of five rooms, are in
the southeast basement of the Smithsonian building, and are equipped with the
recessary folding and sorting tables, bins, file cases, desks, etc. In addition to
the customary supplies for general clerical employment, the service requires
large quantities of cards, labels, and printed forms. The supplies for packing
and shipping are considerable, and so far as practicable are obtained under
annual contract. 8

On May 1, 1905, the Institution was informed that the steamship Buteshire,
which sailed from New York on November 26, 1904, was subject to general
average adjustment on account of fire in the hold of the vessel during the
voyage. Twelve cases of international exchanges destined for Australian ports
formed a part of the cargo, and in the event that the contents of any of these
eases prove to be irreparably damaged they will be replaced by duplicate
volumes, if practicable.

The following tabular statement shows the weight and number of packages
transmitted each month during the year, and also the increase over the previous
twelve months in each class of correspondents. The second table is a statement
of exchange transmissions during each year since 1893.

EXCHANGE OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.

All Government publications gratuitously presented to other governments
through the International Exchange Service during the year, and similar publi-
eations received by the departments and bureaus, are enumerated in the follow-

ing table.

25.66 per cent, over the fiscal year 1903-4,

The receipts from abroad show an increase of 4,166 packages, or

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

57

countries diminished to the extent of 9,648, or 12.89 per cent, during the same

period.

fo

The increase in receipts is particularly gratifying, and is due prin-
cipally to earnest demands, both by personal solicitation and by letter,

yr more

adequate reciprocal returns ; while the diminution in the contributions of United
States official publications is attributable largely to the elimination of many

correspondents who have

not sent an equivalent in their own publications.

With few exceptions the same arrangements exist for distributing exchanges
in other countries as those mentioned in the previous report, and, although
it is a source of regret that every country does not maintain an official exchange
bureau—among the most important being England, Germany, and Austria-
Hungary—the Institution has been successful in enlisting the services of some
institution of learning or prominent individual in nearly all countries not offi-
cially represented, with the result that means have been found for forwarding
exchanges to every part of the world. On account of the extent of the work,
and various disturbances which are liable to occur, interruptions and delays
are sometimes unavoidable.

China is still considering the proposal to establish an official exchange bureau,
and efforts were recently renewed through the diplomatic service with that end
in view, but, pending more satisfactory arrangements, facilities have been
added to the somewhat limited method of distribution. Packages for Shanghai
are now forwarded by post, under frank, through the United States postal agency
in that city, and through the courtesy of the Zi-ka-wei Observatory parcels for
the provinces are distributed with reasonable dispatch.

On account of the difficulty in transporting exchanges from the coast to the
city of Quito all transmissions to Ecuador were suspended for twenty-one
months, but through the efforts of the American minister consignments were re-
uewed on April 4, 1905, with the mutual understanding that exchanges for
Guayaquil and other coast towns should be packed in separate boxes and dis-
tributed to addressees from the port of entry. This arrangement is only tem-
porary, and, on the completion of a railroad now in course of construction from
Guayaquil to Quito, it is expected that all consignments will be forwarded
direct to the last-mentioned city and thence distributed.

Following is a list of correspondents abroad through which the distribution of
exchanges is accomplished. Most of those in the larger and many in the smaller
countries forward reciprocal contributions to the Smithsonian Institution for
distribution in the United States:

missions consisting of one box each were made to each depository on October 1
and December 27, 1904, and on February 28 and April 24, 1905. On the last
date mentioned three additional consignments, comprising complete sets, were
forwarded to Cape Colony, Manitoba, and France, respectively, thus increasing
the number of regular depositories to fifty-three. A list of these depositories

The fifty-three sets of United States official publications referred to were
delivered to the Smithsonian Institution from time to time as they came from
press, and when a sufficient number was received to completely fill the boxes
prepared for them a list was printed to accompany each set, which was then
shipped to its respective destination.

In addition to the above, partial sets were provided under the joint resolu-
tion of Congress approved March 2, 1901, for the purpose of increasing
exchanges with countries for which no provision was made under the limited
resolution of March 2, 1867. The new depositories that had been designated
to the close of the fiscal year 1904-5 were as follows:

As new countries are constantly being added, the partial sets for the depos-
itories designated under the last resolution are not forwarded simultaneously
with those originally provided, but are delivered to the Institution from the
Library of Congress and are dispatched with the next succeeding consign-
ments of miscellaneous exchanges to the respective countries in which the
depositories are situated.

The agencies in those countries which are supported at the expense of the
Smithsonian Institution are represented by Messrs. William Wesley & Son in
London, Mr. Joseph von K6résy in Budapest, and Mr. Karl W. Hiersemann
in Leipzig.

To those efficient representatives who aid the Institution in promoting the
interests of the Exchange Service, both at home and abroad, and to Mr.
Charles A. King, deputy collector of the port of New York, grateful acknowl-
edgments are extended.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
JERI EE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report relating to the condition
and operation of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1905.

New house for mammals.—The principal work that has been prosecuted during
the year for the advancement of the park has been that upon the new house for
mammals. The structural ironwork was completed about December 1, 1904, and
the tile roof was finished about May 1, 1905. This roof was crnamented by
terra-cotta finials after models designed by Mrs. Kemeys. <A large conduit for
heating and ventilating purposes was constructed under the long axis of the
building. The amount expended from the appropriation for the year will reach
about $10,000. As the building is situated near the edge of a steep declivity, a
heavy fill of earth supported by a retaining wall will be required on the eastern
side in order to accommodate the necessary cages and walks. The plastering of
this building, the interior and exterior cages, and the woodwork still remain to
be done. It is hoped to occupy the building during the coming winter. Con-
siderable delays occur from the difficulty of getting suitable mechanics for the
work.

Temporary bird house-—To accommodate the birds kept during the summer
in the large flying cage, as well as those received from the St. Louis Exposition,
two additions were made to this building. A large indoor cage was fitted up
for quail, thrushes, cardinals, ete., and another for finches and other small
species, the latter communicating with an outdoor cage. Yards were con-
structed for the north African and Somali ostriches received from the Presi-
dent, and concrete floors were constructed for several of the larger indoor
cages. The total cost of the alterations and extensions was about $1,200.

Carnivora house.—A new boiler for the heating apparatus was put in with
satisfactory results. Considerable repairs were made to the metal roof, and the
ironwork of the outside cages was thoroughly cleaned and repainted, all at a
cost of about $800.

Temporary bear cages.—As funds were wanting for the construction of the
permanent dens designed for the collection of bears, the small cages in which
those animals are now confined were rearranged so as to give better facilities
for drainage. Drains were laid, gutters constructed, and screens planted.

Inclosures for burrowing rodents.—The inclosures heretofore used for this
purpose at the park have hitherto not been satisfactory, being badly located
and permitting the escape of the animals. Two new inclosures that have proved
very satisfactory have been made during the year. One of these, for prairie
dogs, was formed by excavating the earth to a depth of 44 feet, paving and
grouting the bottom, and then filling in with gravelly earth. Another, for
woodchucks, was not excavated so deeply and was closed at the bottom with
telford pavement. The cost of the two inclosures was about $500.

Repairs to inclosures.—Most of the inclosures in the park are made by wire
fencing, which has now been in use from five to eight years. In the course of

67
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

this time the wire has become seriously weakened by rust in spite of all
efforts made for its preservation. A general reconstruction of the fences and
paddocks will soon be necessary. During the year considerable repairs have
been given to the fences inclosing the deer and the yak, and an additional in-
closure and shelter has been made for deer.

Public comfort rooms.—The park is still deficient in suitable public comfort
rooms for the accommodation of the public, especially for women and children,
and this is especially felt on holidays, when the park is crowded. On Easter
Monday thousands of children, with their parents and nurses, remain at the
park nearly all day, and the accommodations are wholly insufficient. During
the past year the rooms for women have been more than doubled, but they are
still too small. A building is badly needed in which a public comfort room
and restaurant could be combined.

Seats and benches.—During the past year a special clause for the purchase
of seats was inserted in the act making general appropriations for the park.
One hundred and sixty movable seats and 380 stationary benches were made
and distributed throughout the park at points where they may be convenient
for the public.

Coniferous trees.—The park received during the year an important gift of
coniferous trees from Mr. Lowell M. Palmer, of Stamford, Conn. These com-—
prise some thousands of specimens of different species. They will be planted
in appropriate situations, and it is believed that they will eventually greatly
add to the natural beauty of the park.

New survey and map.—TVhe map which was prepared early in the history of
the park has gradually become almost useless because of the numerous altera-
tions that have been made. More accurate and abundant detail was also
required in order that work might be always effectively planned. For this
reason a new survey was made and a map prepared of the most important part
of the park, covering about 40 acres. This map shows all trees, shrubbery,
water and sewer pipes, and every detail of configuration practicable to express
on its scale, which is 50 feet to the inch. Such a survey should be extended to
the entire park.

Important accessions.—The following animals were reeeived by gift:

From the President: One zebra, 1 lion, 2 gelada baboons, 1 north African
ostrich, 1 Somali ostrich (from the King of Abyssinia), 1 female jaguar (from
Ki. HW. Plumacher, American consul at Maracaibo, Venezuela), also several small
mammals, an eagle, etc.

From E. H. Plumacher, American consul, Maracaibo, Venezuela: Twenty-two
specimens, including a young jaguar, 2 ocelots, 2 monkeys, 2 rough foxes, several
parrots, ete.

From the Hon. H. G. Squiers, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipoten-
tiary to Cuba: Hight specimens, including 3 Cuban deer and a hawk-bili turtle.

From Admiral Robley D. Evans, U. S. Navy: One Philippine deer.

There were procured for the park by Dr. F. W. Goding, American consul at
Neweastle, New South Wales: Fifteen specimens, including 3 kangaroos, 1
female Tasmanian devil (to complete pair), 1 male Tasmanian wolf (to com-
plete pair), 2 brush turkeys, 2 Australian cranes, and some smaller birds.

From J. N. Ruffin, American consul at Asuncion, Paraguay: One young jaguar,
2 capybaras, 2 coypus, and a king vulture.

sy exchange there were received from New York Zoological Park: One llama,
1 mandrill baboon, 1 hornbill, 2 crowned cranes.

NORTH AFRICAN OSTRICH PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT BY THE KING OF ABYSSINIA.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

It has been found extremely difficult to make satisfactory arrangements for
transportation from distant South American ports. The steamship companies
refuse to receive animals without prepayment of transportation charges, which
in the case of the United States Government is impracticable. Certain ship-
ments of animals from Buenos Ayres are now waiting until some satisfactory
adjustment can be made.

Through exchange with the New Zealand government (arranged by the
President and mentioned in 1904 report) 8 roe deer were received. Ten
elk, a number of birds, and several small mammals were delivered to the rep-
resentatives of the New Zealand government in February and are understood
to have reached their destination safely. The elk were desired for propagating
purposes.

Births.—The births, 134 in number, included 1 American bison, 7 elk, 4 mule
deer, 2 Columbian black-tailed deer, 3 Virginia deer, 2 fallow deer, 2 Barbary
sheep, 1 Brazilian tapir, 23 blue foxes, 7 dingo, 9 gray wolves, several kanga-
roos, various rodents, ete.; also about 30 young of night heron and other birds
which nested in the flying cage. The wild turkeys which were hatched in the
spring of 1904 have run at large, and 6, together with the hen, still remain in
the park.

Deaths.—Gastro-intestinal troubles was the chief cause of death of animals
and included 2 young jaguars and several other cats, 2 Tasmanian zebra wolves,
a Rocky Mountain sheep, a cassowary, several flamingos, and various other
birds and small mammals. A number of blue foxes were lost from uncinaria
and two from ascaris canis.

Deaths from tuberculosis, though less in number, included more large ani-
mals, among those lost being 1 bison cow, 1 nilghai, 1 red deer, 7 roe deer, 2
elk, and 4 monkeys. The majority of these animals had recently come into
the collection and were undoubtedly affected with the disease when received.
Three monkeys were lost from osteomalacia, or “ cage paralysis,” and a tinamou
from: pulmonary aspergillosis.

Two elk and 1 prong-horn antelope were lost from accident, due in the latter
case to fright.

Autopsies were made as heretofore by the pathologists of the Bureau of
Animal Industry, either at the park, in the case of large animals, or at the
laboratory of the Bureau in the case of the smaller kinds.

Readjustment of boundaries.—An item was again submitted in the estimates
for $60,000 to purchase the land between the park and the new highways estab-
lished along the eastern and western sides of the park. (Public Act, April 28,
1904, ‘For the opening of connecting highways on the east and west sides of
the Zoological Park, District of Columbia.”) No action was taken by Con-
gress.

Exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition—This was successfully main-
tained throughout the season with comparatively little loss. Two keepers were
employed during the summer and autumn. The exhibit closed about the middle
of November on account of cold weather, the birds being removed and trans-
ferred to the National Zoological Park. The cage was purchased by the city
of St. Louis at its appraised value.

Personnel.—The fixed force of the park numbers about 82 persons, of whom
8 are assigned to the administration, 29 to the care of animals, 20 to the mechan-
ical department, 18 to the care of grounds, and 7 to the watch. Considerable
difficulty has been found in obtaining suitable men for positions of keepers of
animals. To be effective in this duty it is necessary to be quick, active, always
alert, neither timorous nor venturesome, and to have a natural aptitude for

cleanliness. These are qualities that are considerably beyond what is required
of a common laborer.
The keepers are divided into three classes receiving compensation as follows:

These men allege that their service is extra hazardous, that they are usually
required to work on Sundays and holidays, and that since the cost of living has
advanced considerably of recent years some advance should be made in their
wages.

Hospital and laboratory.—At present the park has no adequate provision for
the care of sick animals nor for the quarantining of those believed to be af-
fected with contagious or infectious diseases. When ill the animals remain in
the exhibition cages, their sufferings being displayed to the public, and enhanced
by the disturbance which necessarily goes on about them, or, if removed from
their cages, they are placed in unsuitable quarters where they are subject to
annoyance and far from comfortable. Several cases of contagious disease have
been rapidly propagated to several animals for want of means of promptly
isolating the first suspected case. There is need for a suitable building placed
in a secluded part of the grounds where animals can be properly isolated and
treated. ;

Connected with this there should be a laboratory in which proper examina-
tion can be made of the pathological and anatomical material that may come to
hand. But very little is known concerning the diseases that affect wild animals
and the parasites that associate themselves with them. An extension of our
knowledge in this direction would undoubtedly be of benefit to those who are
studying the diseases of man.

In other countries the most significant scientific function of collections of
living animals has been the advancement of knowledge with regard to the
structure, habits, and activities of animals. Nearly all such knowledge has
been derived from zoological collections of a character similar to that of the
National Zoological Park. For example, in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris,
investigations have been carried on since the middle of the eighteenth century
by men who achieved, in this way, a world-wide fame, such as Duverney,
Daubenton, Buffon, Cuvier, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and Milne Edwards; in the
garden of the Zoological Society of London worked Owen, Flower, Huxley,
Sclater, Beddard, and many others; the garden at Berlin afforded Hartmann
material for his work on anthropoid apes, and it was at the Amsterdam garden
that Fiirbringer was able to prepare his monumental work on the structure of
birds. ‘The collections of the National Zoological Park should be utilized in
a similar way.

It is thought that a modest hospital and laboratory, similar to the one recently
established at the zoological garden in Philadelphia, can be built and equipped
at a cost of about $8,000. At the New York Zoological Park an institution of
this kind is about to be erected which will probably cost considerably more.

Roads and paths.—The park is much frequented by carriages. Lying, as
it does, along the valley of Rock Creek, it affords the most convenient and pleas-
ant access to the Rock Creek Park that lies north of it, and the main driveway
in that park communicates directly with the principal road in the National
Zoological Park. On this account it is of especial advantage to the public that
the roadways in the National Zoological Park should always be in good con-

dition. This is not easy, as the descent into the valley of the creek is so abrupt
that the surface of the roads and walks is washed away at every heavy rain.
Considerable damage of this kind is done every year, and this entails a constant
expense for the repair of the roads and walks. Some of the walks on the
steeper slopes should be laid in concrete, which, although more expensive, would
be cheaper in the end.

The portion of the park about the Quarry road entrance is in very bad con-
dition, owing to the fact that the roads and grades exterior to the park have
been recently changed and that ho permanent improvements can be made
within the park until the exterior changes are completed. It is hoped that
sufficient funds may be appropriated to permit the park to take up the work
effectively and place all the roads and walks in a suitable condition.

Shade trees and forestry.—Owing to the pressure of other matters, but little
attention has been paid to the natural forest in the park. This should, however,
be carefully gone over and properly thinned and preserved, as it is one of the
principal attractions sought by the public. The trees planted for the shade of
the walks and seats are not at present sufficient, and considerable additional
planting should be done. It is highly desirable that this should be accoupisie
as soon as possible, as the trees would increase in beauty and size year by year.

Schools, ete., visiting the park.—Since October 15, 1904, a record has been
kept of the various schools and other organizations visiting the park. Up to
June 380, 1905, there were 65 classes from normal and other schools, including
) from out of town, with 1,551 pupils; 7 classes from Sunday schools, including
2 from out of town, with 481 pupils; and 20 miscellaneous organizations,
including 4 from out of town, with 595 persons.

During the year three wooden shelters, covering, respectively, the ccelostat,
the long focus concave mirror, and the bolographie outfit for observing the solar
image, have been erected at a cost of $1,135. This item is chargeable to the
appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30,1904. The fence around the Ob-
servatory lot bas been renewed at a cost of $554. By permission of the park
authorities the Observatory inclosure was at the same time enlarged on the
east and south, and now contains 15,300 square feet.

Apparatus chiefly for use in a proposed expedition to a high altitude observ-
ing station has been procured at a cost of $3,862. Of this sum, $2,527 is
chargeable to the appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904. Usual
periodicals have been continued, a few books of reference have been purchased,
and about 118 volumes have been collated and bound, at a total cost of $369.

No losses of property beyond usual wear and tear have occurred during the
year. :

Changes in personnel.—In the latter half of 1904 Dr. S. A. Mitchell was em-
ployed three months as temporary assistant on stellar radiation experiments.

Richard Norris resigned March 31, 1905.

By request of the Chief of the Weather Bureau Mr. H. H. Kimball was
assigned to the Observatory temporarily for a period beginning May 1, 1905,
in order that he might learn the methods of bolographic observation employed
here.

Mr. L. R. Ingersoll was engaged for three months, beginning May 10, 1905, as
temporary assistant for the Mount Wilson expedition.

Joseph Dwyer, messenger, was engaged April 1, 1905.

WORK OF THE OBSERVATORY.

For convenience I describe the work of the Observatory under the following
headings :

(1) Observations at Washington on the variability of the sun.

(2) Miscellaneous work.

(3) Expedition to Mount Wilson in California.

(1) OBSERVATIONS AT WASHINGTON ON THE VARIABILITY OF THE SUN.

As indicated in your paper, “On a possible variation of the solar radia-
tion,” @ and summarized in my last year’s report, our observations of several
years, but especially of the year 1903, have tended to produce the belief that
the total radiation of the sun may vary in comparatively brief periods, these
variations of solar radiation being irregular in period, but tolerably frequent

and large enough to produce considerable changes of the earth’s mean
temperature.

During the past year the work of the Observatory has been chiefiy directed
toward testing the supposed variability of the sun and increasing our knowl-
edge of it. As I have said in my last report, this investigation has three main
branches as follows:

First. The determination of the intensity and variation of the total solar
radiation reaching the outer limit of our atmosphere. Second, the examination
of the distribution of solar radiation over the sun’s disk for the purpose of
detecting changes of absorption in the solar envelope. Third, the reduction
of temperature measurements from numerous meteorological stations to note
departures of the temperature of the earth from its mean. : .

General view of the results thus far obtained since January, 1902.

Before reporting fully this year’s work I give in the accompanying chart,
Plate V, a general view of the results of the last two and a half years
touching this question. Three series of observations are represented in the
chart, namely :

A. Average departures from mean temperature for 89 stations distributed
over the North Temperate Zone, represented by the full line at the top of the
diagram.

B. The transmission of the solar envelope for radiations of wave length
0.50u¢ (green), as computed from spectrobolometric observations of the sun’s
disk at Washington, represented by the line at the middle of the diagram.

C. The solar radiation outside the earth’s atmosphere as computed from
spectrobolometric observations at Washington, represented by the lower line of
the diagram.

As the observations of type B and earlier ones of type C are frequently
separated by long intervals of time, the lines connecting the points should not
be interpreted as necessarily indicating the intervening values of the quantity
observed. .

Observations of the solar constant taken in Washington are seldom of a satis-
factory character, owing to the scarcity of days when uniform transparency of
the atmosphere persists for the several hours required for the determinations.
Accordingly only a few of the observations of type C are entitled to great
weight, and these are designated in the diagram by the letter G to denote it.
Observations of good character, but less satisfactory than these first, are desig-
nated by M, denoting medium weight. A still less perfect class, to which, un-
fortunately, most of the observations of 1904 and 1905 belong, is designated by
the letter L, signifying of little weight. Some observations still less satisfactory
than these I have omitted from the diagram as deserving no weight at all.

Considering now the diagram it will be seen that early in the year 1905 there
was a long-continued period of abnormally high terrestrial temperature, and
this was followed by a still longer period of abnormally low temperature. Cor-
responding well with this state of affairs are the observations of total solar
radiation, and these observations are fortunately almost all of great, or at least
medium, weight. In September, 1903, a single observation of the transmission
of the solar envelope was made, and this, compared with others of more recent
date, is low, indicating that diminished transparency of the solar enyelope was
the probable reason for the small amount of radiation and low temperature
observed at the same time.

In the year 1994 there was no long-continued period of abnormal temperature

4 Results of a similar trend are obtained for all wave lengths, and this wave
length is chosen merely in illustration,

departure comparable with those noted in 1905. So far as there were notable
variations from the mean in the temperature of the North Temperate Zone,
these occurred in January and February, and in October and November of 1904.
On the whole, these departures are confirmatory of the indications of the spec-
tro-bolometric determinations of total radiation for the same periods, but these
results, owing to scarcity of good weather, are lamentably inadequate. Still,
a medium-weight observation of June indicates average temperature and is
followed by it; a first-class observation of October 5 indicates high temperature
and is followed by it, and a medium-weight observation of October 22, indicating
low temperature, is followed by it. Prior to December there are only two
observations of solar transmission, of which the first, a high value, comes just
at the end of a period of high temperature, while the second, a low value, in
November, comes just preceding a short period of low temperature. In Decem-
ber higher values are found and higher temperatures follow.

The temperature departures of the first half of 1905 also present no such
fayorable opportunity for comparison with solar radiation phenomena as was
presented in 1903. The data on total solar radiation have not been fully re-
duced as yet, so that they appear still more meager than in former years, and
more so than they will after all returns are in. But the weather seidom per-
mitted satisfactory solar constant determinations at Washington in the first
half of 1905. Those observations here given fall in fairly well, as will be
seen, with the record of temperature departures. Observations of the solar
transmission have been made very frequently since December, 1904, and are as
« rule nearly average values and indicative of average temperatures, and thus
in accord with the facts tor the North Temperate Zone. Increasing values in
December and January and diminishing ones in February and in April and
May have their counterparts in the temperature curve for the North Temperate
Zone. The temporarily lower values in June find no counterpart in the tem-
peratures of the North Temperate Zone, but a fall of temperature may possibly
be shown early in July.

Taking all the facts together we find high values of solar radiation and solar
transmission preceding and accompanying high temperatures of the North
Temperate Zone; low values of solar radiation and solar transmission preced-
ing and accompanying low temperatures of the North Temperate Zone, and
intermediate values of these solar phenomena accompanying intermediate ter-
restrial temperatures. The evidence at hand is still too fragmentary to pro-
duce full conviction, but subject to later confirmation or rejection, as further
work shall prove, the results obtained thus far strongly indicate that the
transparency of the solar envelope varies at irregular intervals, with conse-
quent fluctuations of the solar radiation transmitted to the earth, and that
this in turn affects the mean temperature of the earth.

Observations of 1904-5.

(a) Solar constant awork.—Determinations of the radiation reaching the
earth’s surface, both in toto and for separate wave lengths, have been made
at all times when conditions permitted, and have been reduced as in former
years to give the transmission of our atmosphere, and the total radiation
reaching its outer limit. As above stated the number of days when the sky
has continued satisfactorily uniform for this purpose have been few, and besides
owing to the press of observing and computing work it has not been possible
to compute all the results as yet, so that on both accounts the tables which
follow are more than usually meager. Table 1 gives in continuation of similar
tables in preceding reports the transmission of the atmosphere at various wave
lengths for vertical rays.

The mean results will be found to lie extremely near the corresponding ones
for the year 1903—t, so that no further discussion of them seems necessary.

In Table 2 are given the values computed for the solar constant of radiation
outside cur atmosphere, in continuation of the series published in former years.
The method of computation and the assumptions on which it is based have been
given in preceding reports and are substantially thuse employed by you many
years ago at Allegheny.

78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The rating of the character of the observation is made chiefly by inspection
of the logarithmic plots used in determining the atmospheric transmission,
similar to those published facing page 80 of your report for the year ending
June 30, 1903. On an excellent day the observations thus plotted, like those
just referred to, lie close to representative straight lines, but such days are
unfortunately very rare in Washington, and especially within the last two
years, owing in part to building and other operations producing smoky and non-
uniform atmospheric conditions. The bearing of the results given in Table 2
on the question of the variability of the sun has already been given.

Before leaving the subject of solar constant observations it may well be
remarked that Mr. Fowle has published within the year a valuable paper giv-
ing a comparison between the solar constant values deduced by the method of
homogeneous rays and those deduced for the same days by the old method of
high and low sun observations of the total radiation of the sun by the
sctinometer alone.e This old method, the method of Pouillet, gives necessarily
too low results, as you long ago demonstrated.?

What is valuable in Mr. Fowle’s paper is that he shows that the defect is
almost constant at Washington, no matter what the time of the year, the trans-
parency of the air, or the humidity, provided the extrapolation is made with
moderate solar zenith distances. Thus if observations be made in Washington
with the actinometer alone and extrapolated by the aid of a logarithmic plot
to the limits of the atmosphere, and a correction of 14 per cent is then added,
the result will be practically the same as if the spectrobolometric method
had been used. If additional measurements should confirm this result (that
2 constant difference between the two methods holds here and at other locali-
ties), then the process of detecting variations in solar radiation outside our
atmosphere would be much easier, for it could be made to depend on actinometer
measures alone, and, indeed, old series of observations made years ago could
be utilized.

I give in illustration the following table, taken in part from Mr. Fowle’s
paper above cited, showing how closely solar constant values deduced from
pyrheliometer measures alone, by the application of the 14 per cent correction,
agree with values deduced when possible from spectrobolometric work of the
same days.

(b) Transmission of the solar envelope.-—As stated above the apparatus for
examining the solar image has been provided with appropriate shelters, and
1S how much improved over its condition last year. The great coelostat was
exhibited at St. Louis in 1904, and as a substitute a smaller coelostat was
arranged at the Observatory shop. The larger coelostat was not returned from
St. Louis until January, 1905, and, in the press of preparation for the Mount
Wilson expedition, time could not well be spared to set it up, so that the smaller
instrument has served throughout the year. Many measurements, both of the
distribution of radiation along the diameter of the solar disk and of its distri-
bution in sun spots, have been made after the manner explained last year.c A
revision has been made of all the data obtained relating to the distribution along
u diameter, on the assumptions (1) that we study a phenomenon of absorption
only; (2) occurring in a homogeneous medium situated outside the photosphere,
and (8) extending to 21 per cent of the solar radius.

With these assumptions it appears that the form of the distribution curves as
shown in Plate VIII of last year’s report agree within the experimental error
with that deduced from the ordinary simple exponential absorption formula.
As this formula in a logarithmic form is peculiarly adapted to graphical illus-
trations and comparison of results, all the measurements have been reduced on
the above basis and the results to be given below in Table 3 depend on it. It
goes without saying that the assumptions made are not harmonious with our
conceptions of the sun’s absorbing envelope, and they are only made for want
of better and for the sole purpose of more readily comparing the results of dif-

80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ferent days. This arbitrary method of reduction is necessary, for differences
of atmospheric transparency and differences of solar distance make a direct
comparison of one observational curve with another complicated and unsatis-
factory.
Plate VI shows two of the solar curves plotted with abscissz as air-masses
derived on the above assumptions, and ordinates as the logarithmic deflections.
The general absorption of the solar envelope appears to be like that of the
earth’s atmosphere, greatest at the violet end of the spectrum. This is shown,
end also some of the changes which have been noted in the apparent solar trans-
mission, in Table 3.
In this table the numbers purport to represent the percentage transmission of
the solar envelope for vertical rays, on different days, and for various rays
between wave lengths 0.4 in the violet, and 2.0 in the infra-red. The results
_are based on the assumptions stated above, and a considerable difference will be
noted from the corresponding table of last year, owing to a change in the
assumed thickness of the absorbing envelope.

ABSORPTION OF SOLAR ENVELOPE.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 8]

The bolometric examination of sun spots shows that they, too, exhibit much
greater absorption at the violent end of the spectrum than in the infra-red. Thus.
if our eye were like the bolometer, and could view sun spots by homogeneous
‘ays of different wave lengths of the infra-red as well as violet, we should see
the same spot four times as dark in violet light as when viewed by extreme
infra-red rays.

In all the observations and reductions involved in the work described above
Mr. Fowle has taken by far the greatest share.

The temperature data plotted in Plate V are reduced from the Internationaler
Dekadenberichte, published by the Kaiserliche Marine Deutsche Seewarte. The
reductions were made partly by R. Norris and partly by J. Dwyer.

(2) MISCELLANEOUS WORK.

Radiation of the stars.

Preliminary preparations were made for the detection of the radiation of
the brighter stars. It was at first thought practicable to mount the bolometer
in the center of the tube of the 50-centimeter diameter mirror of 1-meter focus
and to point the mirror directly upon the star to be examined, but it was
quickly found that the disturbances due to exposure to outside air were too
great to be permissible with the refined sensitiveness of the bolometric appa-
ratus. Afterwards the mirror and bolometer were placed within the inner
chamber of the observatory, and the starlight was reflected in from a 30-inch
plane mirror on the coelostat. The galvanometer employed was the one de-
scribed at pages 91-92 of your report for the year ending June 30, 1902.

The sensitiveness available depends largely on reducing the damping of the
needle, and a long time’ was spent in making the galyanometer case air-tight,
so that a pressure of 1/1000 atmosphere or less could be maintained without
rapid change. In this we were at length so successful that the change of
pressure was hardly appreciable in several months. Great difficulty was en-
countered in balancing the bolometric apparatus at the high sensitiveness em- -
ployed on account of small electromotive forces in the galvanometer circuit
and its shunts. Thus a balance would be obtained with a certain shunt across
the galvanometer, and on passing to the next shunt a very great deflection would
be found, due to a new electromotive force in the new shunt circuit. At length
it proved necessary to discard shunts wholly, and to employ instead a variable
resistance in series with the galvanometer. Great difficulty was still ex-
perienced in balancing, but not so great as to render it impossible, as before.
When once balanced the apparatus was well behaved. The sensitiveness ap-
peared from tests on candle flames to be very much greater than that obtained
by previous experimenters on stellar radiation. Unfortunately the difficulties
encountered were not surmounted until early in January, and bad weather pre-
vented a trial on the stars until more important work displaced the investi-
gation for the present.

New apparatus.

Bolometer.—In our previous construction of bolometers we have been guided
more by experience than by any theory in their design. While preparing for
the research on stellar variation it seemed very desirable to determine the
conditions which would insure the highest sensitiveness. Accordingly the
subject was studied from the standpoint of Fourier’s analytical theory of heat,
and numerous experiments were made to further enlighten it. As a result a
complete theory of bolometer construction was reached, and it is now possible
82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

{o know in advance how to design and construct a bolometer to give the best
result under stated conditions.

In accordance with the results thus reached, a vacuum bolometer was con-
structed for the observation of stellar heat which is several times as sensi-
tive for the purpose as the best bolometer hitherto prepared here.

Celostat—A new celostat with two 15-inch mirrors was obtained for the
proposed expedition to a high-altitude station. The general design was pre-
pared at the Observatory, and the construction was by Mr. M. E. Kahler, of
Washington, excepting some work done on the clock at the Observatory shop.
A photograph of the apparatus as in use at Mount Wilson is here shown
(Plate VII).

Several unusual features may be noted. The rotating mirror is shown
mounted on a carriage which may travel on ways either east and west or
north and south, so as to be adjusted for the position of the sun at any
time in the year. The carriage is of the same height as the lower base of
the support of the second mirror, and the two mirrors may be interchanged
if desired, so that the rotating one can be fixed in one place and the east-
and-west and north-and-south motions can be made with the other. The
driving clock is fastened to the support of the polar axis and designed to run
equally well in any position, so that the adjustment of the axis for different
latitudes can be made without altering the driving mechanism. In order to
conform to the motion of the carriage, the clock is driven by springs instead of
weights. At your suggestion there was introduced a driving spring, which
is itself kept wound to a nearly constant tension by two larger springs. Thus
the driving force is uniform though the two larger springs run down. ‘The rate
of their unwinding is governed by an escapement driven from the governor
train. The governor itself is of the centrifugal type, but has springs instead
of gravity as the governing force, and will thus run in any position. The
accuracy of the clock is ample, so that the reflected beam from the ccelostat
frequently remains constant-in direction within one minute of are for a half
hour.

Standard pyrheliometer.—Mention was made in my last year’s report of a
new form of pyrheliometer then under construction. This instrument has
been completed and ferms a part of the equipment of the Mount Wilson expe-
dition. It appears to justify all the hopes that had been connected with it.
As stated last year, it receives solar rays in a hollow blackened chamber of the
shape of a test tube, from which little radiation can escape by reflection, or
heat by convection, owing to the deepness of the chamber and to its numerous
blackened diaphragms. A current of water circulates around this chamber
and takes up the heat absorbed on its walls. Platinum resistance wires serve
to determine the temperature of the water before and after its passage around
the chamber. Thus the sun’s rays entering a knewn aperture produce a
measurable rise of temperature in a known amount of water. A certain check
is had on the accuracy of the measurement, for a coil of wire is introduced
within the rear end of the chamber, and in this coii heat may be produced
electrically at a known rate. ‘This heat warms the air and indirectly reaches
the walls of the chamber, and may be measured as if it were produced by
radiation. :

At nine recent trials made on several different days, with the instrument in
different positions and with different rates of flow of the water current, the
heat “ found” ran between 97 per cent and 103 per cent of the heat intro-
duced. The mean of nine trials gave 100.4 per cent “found.” If, then, the
electrically supplied heat is thus closely measurable, much more should that

of the sun be, which is absorbed at once on the walls of the chamber instead
of indirectly by air convection.

The instrument is mounted equatorially and driven by clockwork, and the
rate of flow of the water current, lapse of time and temperature change
caused by radiation, are all recorded photographically on a moving drum.
Hence a continuous automatic record of the solar radiation is produced. In
use at Mount Wilson it is not easy to avoid considerable temperature change
of the apparatus, and this causes a slight “drift” of the record, but not
enough to prevent runs of several hours’ duration without attention.

A considerable part of the apparatus for the continuous pyrheliometer was
made by the International Instrument Company, of Cambridge, Mass. ‘The
more refined parts for the receipt and measurement of the radiation were
constructed by Mr. Kramer at the Observatory shop. In this, and in a great
amount of other work during the year, Mr. Kramer has combined skill with
rare willingness and interest in a way which deserves commendation.

(3) THE EXPEDITION TO MOUNT WILSON, IN CALIFORNIA.

From the very beginning, in 1902, of experiments in Washington on the meas-
urement of the solar constant of radiation it has been your aim to continue
these measurements at a more favorable situation as regards cloudiness, and
particularly as regards elevation. You long ago showed that in optical quality
the lower air is far inferior to that lying above, and you have repeatedly stated
your conviction that exact determinations of the absorption of the atmosphere
are impossible at stations near sea level. Congress having approved of your
plan to conduct these observations at high altitudes, apparatus has been col-
lected during the past three years for an expedition to a favorable station for
the measurement of the solar constant.

In the meantime the Carnegie Institution had been founded, and by invita-
tion of one of its officers you stated, in a communication to the Hon. C. D.
Walcott, dated February 28, 1902, your belief that the establishment by the
Carnegie Institution of an observatory to be situated at some high and cloud-
less point and engaged for at least a complete sun-spot cycle in the accurate
determination of the solar constant of radiation would be a worthy astronom-
ical undertaking and one most likely, in your judgment, to yield results of value
both from the standpoint of pure science and from that of practical utility
to mankind.

In 1904 the Carnegie Institution began the establishment of a solar obserya-
tory on Mount Wilson, in California, under the direction of Prof. G. E. Hale,
and the objects of this observatory include the measurement of solar radiation,
which you had urged. Almost immediately after the installation at Mount
Wilson had been begun, Professor Hale, recognizing the large share you have
had from the first in promoting the establishment of such an observatory, and
knowing of the preparations making at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa-
tory for an expedition to a high station to observe the solar constant, invited
you to send this expedition to Mount Wilson, and promised all possible coopera-
tion during its stay, and suggested that the work would, if desirable, be taken
up by the new solar observatory when the Smithsonian expedition should be
withdrawn. This invitation was accepted. The equipment, consisting of a full
spectro-bolographie and pyrheliometric outfit, the equal and in some respects
the superior of that installed in Washington, was sent forward in April, 1905.
The observers, C. G. Abbot in charge, and L. R. Ingersoll, temporary assistant,
reached the ground about May 10. Two shelters for the spectro-bolometer and
the continuous pyrheliometer, respectively, already framed in the valley below,
84 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

were immediately erected on Mount Wilson, and were finished, including all
their piers and accessories, in about two weeks. The spectro-bolometer was
completely installed and the first bolographic observations were made June 6,
1905.

In the meantime observations had been made nearly every day with the mer-
cury pyrheliometer, and these had given promise of great transparency and
uniformity of sky. From the 1st of June hardly a cloud was ever seen above
the level of the horizon for many weeks. Extraordinary calmness adds to the
advantages of this site. A few of the earliest bolographs were measured at
ence to see if all appeared to be well, and, as the measurements turned out very
satisfactorily, bolographic work was continued nearly every day thereafter,
leaving the reduction of the observations to a later time.

Investigations at Washington, as already reported, have given strong grounds
for the conclusion that the solar radiation varies considerably and frequently
in its amount. It would be most desirable if the Mount Wilson expedition
could give ample opportunity to test this conclusion, but in spite of the too
short time at present command it has been thought best by you to initiate it, and
at the same time to study more closely the manner of the solar variability. To
this end the work includes, not only solar-constant measurements, but other
studies designed to add to our knowledge of the whole question.

The expedition is under the greatest obligations for the continued aid fur-
nished by the director and staff of the Carnegie Solar Observatory. ‘The results
obtained will doubtless form a principal part of next year’s report.

SUMMARY.

The principal object of the Observatory during the past year has continued
to be the measurement of the solar radiation. The work of this and the two
preceding years strongly supports the view that the radiation of the sun is
frequently diminished and augmented for periods of a few weeks or months,
in consequence of a variability of the transparency of the solar absorbing en-
velope, and that this variation of radiation causes and quickly produces
changes of several degrees in the mean temperature of the Jand areas of the
earth. It is hoped that the study of the solar radiation will soon prove a val-
uable aid in forecasting climate.

Important additions and improvements have been made in the equipment of
the Observatory, both in buildings and apparatus. The new apparatus includes
a standard pyrheliometer, capable of continuously registering the solar radia-
tion and provided with means of certifying the exactness of its measures inde-
pendently of the theory of the instrument.

An expedition to measure and test the variability of solar radiation has
been sent to Mount Wilson, in Southern California.

Respectfuly submitted.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report on the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905:

The publications received by the Institution and recorded in the accession
books of the Smithsonian deposit, Library of Congress, number as follows:

Quarto or Octayo or .

Oo lerdard

The accession numbers run from 460377468086.
s in the past a few of these publications were retained at the Institution for
the use of the scientific staff, but the larger number have been sent direct to the
Library of Congress. The entire sendings from the Institution required the use
of about 274 boxes, which it is estimated contained the equivalent of 10,960
octavo volumes. This estimate does not include, however, a large number of
public documents presented to the Smithsonian Institution and sent direct to
the Library of Congress without recording.
At the close of the year ending June 30, 1904, there remained in the Museum
library a number of the scientific series, together with books and pamphlets on
special subjects, belonging to the Smithsonian deposit, to be withdrawn, checked,
and sent to the Library of Congress, these publications haying been held at the
Museum when that Library was overcrowded in its old quarters at the Capitol.
While 7,805 parts were transmitted during the past year, it has not been pos-
sible to complete the checking, owing to the fact that the time of the small force
in the Smithsonian library was fully occupied with current work, but every effort
wili be made to finish the task before the close of the present year, when all of
the series of periodicals and publications belonging to the deposit, with the
exception of those in actual use, will be in the hands of the Librarian of
Congress. ;

The libraries of the Secretary, Office, and Astrophysical Observatory have
received during the year 418 volumes, pamphlets and charts, and 2,040 parts
of volumes, making a total of 2,458, and a grand total, including books for the
Smithsonian deposit and the Watts de Peyster collection Napoleon Bonaparte,
of 35,820.

The parts of serial publications that were entered on the card catalogue
numbered 26,000. One thousand seven hundred and thirty-five slips for com-
pleted volumes were made, and about 720 cards for new periodicals and an-
nuals were added to the permanent record from the periodical recording desk.

85
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Inaugural dissertations and academic publications were received from uni-
versities at the following places:

Ann Arbor. Erlangen. Marburg.

Baltimore (Johns Hop- Freiburg. Philadelphia (University
kins). Giessen. of Pennsylvania).

Basel. Grefswald. Rostock.

Berlin. Halle. Strassburg.

Bern. Heidelberg. Toulouse.

Bonn. Kiel. Manchester (England).

Breslau. Lawrence (Kansas). Zurich.

In continuing the Secretary’s plan to effect new exchanges and to secure
missing parts to complete sets, 1,405 letters were written, 301 new periodicals
were added to the receipts, and 527 defective series were partly or entirely
completed. In addition to the letters above referred to there were 175 postal
eards sent asking for current numbers that failed to reach the Institution,
which resulted in 103 being received.

The scientific staff and others have continued to consult the proceedings and
transactions of the learned societies in the reference room, and from the read-
ing room 21 bound volumes of periodicals were withdrawn and 4,568 scientific
periodicals and magazines were borrowed for consultation.

The sectional libraries maintained in the Institution, the Secretary’s library,
Office library, and the Employees’s library, together with those of the Astro-
physical Observatory, Aerodromics, International Exchanges, and Law Refer-
ence, have been used by persons from the other scientific bureaus of the Goy-
ernment, as well as members of the immediate staff.

In the Secretary’s and Office library 107 books were bound, and special at-
tention was given to collating the publications in the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, with the result that 118 completed volumes were bound at the Government
bindery. At the National Zoological Park 8 volumes have been added to the
library by purchase.

THE EMPLOYEE’S LIBRARY.

The popularity of the Hmployee’s library has continued, and during the year
2,262 books were borrowed. The new books added to the library by purchase
numbered 19, and 78 completed volumes of magazines were bound. ‘The send-
ing of about 40 of the books from this library to the National Zoological Park
and 26 to the Bureau of American Ethnology each month has been continued
with marked appreciation from the two bureaus.

THE WATKINS LIBRARY.

Within the last few months the trustees of the estate of the late Dr. J.
Hifreth Watkins have turned over to the Smithsonian Institution his large and
valuable library consisting in the main of books relating to engineering and
transportation. A book plate has been provided and the books listed, and it is
hoped that they may soon be available for the use of those interested in the
subject to which they relate.

THE JOHN DONNELL SMITH LIBRARY.

Through the munificence of Capt. John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore, the
library of the Smithsonian Institution has become enriched by his collection
of botanical works, numbering about 1,600 volumes, containing books bearing
upon the flora of tropical America, carefully selected and substantially and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. reat

artistically bound. This donation was made in connection with the gift to the

‘Institution of his herbarium, and brings to the National Museum, where the
library will be deposited, an unrivaled basis of equipment for the prosecution of
2 complete botanical exploration of Central America and a critical study of its
whole flora.

WATTS DE PEYSTER COLLECTION NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE.

It is very gratifying to report the,rapid increase of the Watts de Peyster
Collection Napoleon Buonaparte through the continued gifts of Gen. John Watts
de Peyster. The additions during the year numbered 1,775 volumes and 1,007
maps.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

The Institution has continued to act as the representative in the United
States for the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, and has indexed
and classified for the Central Bureau at London the scientific literature of the
United States. During the past year the number of references sent to the
Central Bureau at London was 24,182, an increase of nearly three thousand
over the previous year, 2s follows:

All of the first annual issue of the International Catalogue has been published,
together with all of the second annual issue, excepting the volume of Zoology
and five volumes of the third annual issue, namely, Mathematics, Mechanics,
Physics, Astronomy, and Bacteriology.

MUSEUM LIBRARY.

In the Museum library there are now 24,170 bound volumes and 38,643 un-
bound papers. The additions during the year consisted of 3,573 books, 8,048
pamphlets, and 563 parts of volumes. There were catalogued 1,952 books, of
which 101 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit, and 3,755 pamphlets, of which
185 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit, and 12,216 parts of periodicals, of
which 1,309 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit. In the accession book 3,573
volumes, 3,048 pamphlets, and 563 parts of volumes were recorded. The num-
ber of cards added to the author’s catalogue was 5,942, which does not include
847 cards for books and pamphlets recatalogued.

In connection with the entering of periodicals 55 memoranda were made
reporting volumes and parts missing in the sets, together with a few titles of
publications that were not represented in the library. The result of this
work was the completing or partly filling up of 23 sets of periodicals.

Throughout the whole year attention has been given to the preparation of
volumes for binding, with the result that 1,871 books were bound, and at the
close of the year there were several hundred more ready for the binder.

The number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed from the general
library amounted to 40,400, including 9,192 which were assigned to the sec-
tional libraries.
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GrnrraL Aprrnpix to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of
its history, been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1905.

NEW MEASUREMENTS OF THE DISTANCE OF THE SUN.*

By A. R.. Hinks, M. A.

When I received the honor of an invitation to lecture at the School
of Military Engineering on some astronomical subject, I had little
difficulty in making my choice of a topic. There is just one subject
on which I may speak with some httle first-hand knowledge; and
by great good fortune that subject is concerned with a problem which
has both in its nature and its history a connection with the Corps of
Royal Engineers.

The problem of the determination of the distance of the sun is, in
some respects at least, the most fundamental in the whole range of
astronomy, for the number which represents it is involved in almost
any calculation of distances and masses, of sizes and densities, either
of planets or their satellites or of the stars. The distance of the sun
bears somewhat the same relation to other problems of celestial sur-
veying as the size and shape of the earth bear to terrestrial. It may
not always appear on the surface, but it is generally concealed some-
where in the depths of the calculations. And I am compelled to
confess that in one respect the earth measurers have the advantage
over astronomers. The utmost that the astronomer can do is to
show that the distance of the sun is so many times the radius of the
earth. But ask him to put it into miles and he is powerless to do
so until the geodesists have told him how large the earth is; and it
is there that, in the very nature of the case, we are compelled to
depend in the end upon the scientific labors of your corps.

A difference of 0°01” in the parallax is equivalent to 106,000 miles, or 170,000 kilometers.

Let us look at the matter for a moment as a problem in pure sur-
veying. To measure the distance of the sun we have as a base a
chord somewhat less than the diameter of the earth, since observa-
tions can not be made on a heayenly body when it 1s actually on the
horizon. Suppose we put our base line at nine-tenths of the diam-
eter. Our problem is to determine the distance of a body so far away
that the whole diameter of the earth subtends at it an angle of only
ubout 17.6 seconds of are; and with our somewhat diminished base
this angle is reduced to a little less than 15 seconds. I believe that
the length of your base upon the great lines of Chatham is about
1,730 feet. Imagine that from that base you had to determine with
an accuracy greater than one in a thousand the distance of an inter-
sected point about 4,500 miles away, as far away as Chicago, and you
have a problem which is by comparison simplicity itself. For the
ends of our 7,000-mile base are not visible from each other, being on
epposite sides of the world, and our angles at the base must be
determined by a complicated reference to the zenith, with all the
well-known impossibilities of determining absolute places in the sky
increased by the special difficulties that arise when the object to be
observed is the sun. You will readily grant that to determine the
distance of the sun by direct observation of that body is impossible,
unless you are content with an accuracy of about 1 im 10.

Now, it is a curious fact that there is a way of obtaining the dis-
tance of the sun with an accuracy of 10 per cent with no other instru-
ment than a clock keeping accurate time. You do it by observing
the times of minima of the variable star Algol. Every two days
twenty-one hours Algol drops more than a magnitude, and does
this with a regularity which would be unfailing were it not for the
fact that at one season of the year we are nearer the star by nearly
the whole diameter of the earth’s orbit than we are at the opposite
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. 103

season; and light takes about sixteen minutes to traverse that dis-
tance. In the middle of November the eclipses of Algol are taking
place eight minutes earlier than the average. In May, could we
observe the star so near the sun, they would be found eight minutes
behind their time; and a practised observer could, on a long series of
observations, determine that inequality, with a total range of sixteen
minutes, well within two minutes—that is to say, with an accuracy
of about 10 per cent. We have then only to combine this quantity
with the known velocity of light and we have a measure of the sun’s
distance. A mere curiosity in itself, it will serve to introduce us to
some indirect ways of determining the distance of the sun which
have, both practically and historically, a peculiar interest and im-
portance.

At the present time we are in the thick of a new determination of
the distance of the sun on a scale of operations greater than has been
known before. More than fifty observatories of the Northern Hemi-
sphere are engaged more or less deeply on the work, which has occu-
pied a great many of us closely for the last four years and will give
plenty of trouble to some of us for several years to come. Before
we enter upon the consideration of the new method and the new
opportunities we might well pause to answer the question, which is
by no means superfluous, How does it come about that, at the end of
the nineteenth century, which had seen attempts almost innumerable
to measure the distance of the sun, the result was still so much in
doubt that it was worth while to concentrate quite a large proportion
of the total astronomical energy of the world upon a new attempt?
I believe that’ we shall find some explanation of this fact if we
examine the history of the various values of the solar parallax that
were used in the Nautical Almanac during the nineteenth century.

A determination of the distance of the sun by direct observation of

the sun itself is impracticable; the sun is too difficult an object to

observe with any great accuracy: its distance is too great, and our
base is too small for any method of direct trigonometrical survey to
be possible. But we can in effect diminish its distance by substitut-
ing for it one of the planets, which can be more accurately observed,
for when the distance of any cne planet from the earth is known, the
dimensions of other orbits follow by the application of Kepler’s third
law. And at the same time we can, as we shall see, secure the ines-
timable advantage that the measures to be made are relative and not
absolute.

Let me digress for a moment to insist upon the importance of this
distinction. If you wished to find the difference in latitude and lon-
gitude between your Institute and the trigonometrical point at Dar-
land, you might determine the latitude and longitude of each and
take the differences, or you might triangulate from one to the other.
104 NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

One is an absolute method, the other a relative, and it 1s scarcely
necessary to emphasize the difference in accuracy between the two.
We shall see that, various as are the kinds of measurement which
may be made to contribute to a knowledge of the solar parallax, they
are all of them relative measurements. For example, one may ob-
serve the displacement of the planet Mars among the stars, as seen
from a northern and a southern station—say Greenwich and the
Cape—or one may observe the displacement of the place of Venus in
transit across the sun from stations suitably chosen. In each case we
are measuring the displacement as viewed from different stations of a
near object with respect to one farther off, the displacement of Mars
among the stars or of Venus against the sun. We have secured the
advantages that the parallactic displacement to be measured is
greater than that of the sun itself; that the objects to be observed,
Mars or Venus, are better adapted for observation, and that the meas-
ures are relative.

In the middle of the eighteenth century Lacaille made observations
of Mars at the Cape of Good Hope, which were compared with others
made at various observatories in Europe, and he deduced a parallax
of about ten seconds. In the same century there occurred the two
famous transits of Venus of 1761 and 1769, which were very exten-
sively observed, among others by Captain Cook on his celebrated ex-
pedition for that purpose to the South Seas. Many and various were
the results obtained by different discussions of the observations, Lying
between eight and one-half and nine and one-half seconds, but decid-
edly less than the parallax found from Mars, and we find that at the
beginning of the nineteenth century the Nautical Almanac adopted
a value in round numbers, nine seconds, as the best that could be
made of them.

In 1824 the German astronomer Encke submitted to a very search-
ing examination the collected results of the transit of 1769 and
deduced the result 8°5776 seconds, which, with its imposing train of
decimals intact, was incorporated in our Nautical Almanac for 1834,
survived until 1869, and was responsible for the statement, which
many of us can remember in the schoolbooks, that the distance of
the sun is 95,000,000 miles.
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. 105

Meanwhile the attack upon the problem had been maintained in
several different ways, and particularly by an indirect method that
has many points of interest.

In the lunar theory there occurs, among the short-period perturba-
tions to which the motion of the moon is subject, an inequality in a
period of a month which depends upon the fact that the disturbing
action of the sun is greater on that half of the moon’s orbit which lies
toward the sun than upon the other half. The result of this is that
the moon is more than two minutes behind at first quarter and two
minutes ahead at last quarter of the place which she would occupy
were there no perturbation. It is clear that the magnitude of the
effect must depend upon the ratio of the distances of the sun and
moon from the earth; and since the effect is large, an oscillation
either way of about one hundred and twenty-five seconds, this should
give a strong determination of the solar parallax, provided that the
moon can be observed with the required accuracy and that the theo-
retical relation between the perturbation and the solar parallax is
firmly established. In 1858 Leverrier found in this way a value of
8-95 seconds; several other determinations supported this large
value, and practically all the determinations made since 1830, how-
ever much they might disagree among themselves, agreed at any rate
in one thing, that Encke’s value was much too small. We find, there-
fore, that in the Nautical Almanac for 1870, published in 1866,
Leverrier’s value, 8-95 seconds, is adopted, and the official distance of
the sun changed at one swoop from 95,000,000 to 91,000,000 miles.

But now preparations were in full swing for the observations of
the transit of Venus of 1874 and 1882, which for many years had been
eagerly awaited in the full expectation and belief that then, with all
the manifold improvements in the arts of observation, in the inven-
tion of the heliometer and the application of photography to celestial
measurement, the question of the solar parallax would be definitely
settled. We can not do more than glance at the most beautiful and
most complicated geometrical problems involved in the consideration
of all the circumstances of a transit of Venus. But these two
diagrams ¢ will show some of the circumstances of the very important
phenomena, the times of internal contact at ingress and egress, the
times when Venus is just completely on the sun and just about to
begin to go off. Great preparations were made for observing these
times of ingress and egress, and the results would undoubtedly have
been successful had it not been for the cruel way in which the
geometrical sharpness of the phenomenon is ruined by the lighting

up of the atmosphere of Venus; there was no instant when tangency
was perceptible, and, to be frank, the transit of Venus as a means of
determining the distance of the sun was a failure. The photographic
and heliometer observations had for various reasons met with no
better success than the observations of contacts; there was no con-
sistency about the results.

But just as the preparations for the transits were beginning in
1867 Prof. Simon Newcomb had published an elaborate discussion
of the solar parallax based upon several different methods. With
some of these we are already familiar, and I will call attention to one
only, the last, which we have not as yet discussed.

Components of Newcomb’s value.

Tt is an effect of aberration that every star describes yearly in the
sky an ellipse of which the semimayjor axis is about 20°5 seconds, and
this number is called the constant of aberration. It is the ratio of
the velocity of the earth in its orbit to the velocity of light. When
the constant is known and the velocity of light is known, the velocity
of the earth in its orbit is known; and since the time of describing
that orbit is also known, the size of the orbit and the distance of the
earth from the sun follow immediately.

In 1876 it appeared then that there was strong evidence against the
value 8°95 seconds; and without waiting for the results of the tran-
sit of Venus expeditions, the Nautical Almanac adopted for the while
the value 8-848 seconds found by Newcomb from this galaxy of results
which looked so accordant; and that value was first used in the
Almanac for 1882, the year of the second transit.

But meanwhile Sir David Gill, who had observed the transit of
1874 at Mauritius and had made up his mind very definitely that no
good would come out of the transit of 1882, had borrowed Lord
Lindsay’s heliometer and established himself on the island of Ascen-
sion to observe with the heliometer the opposition in 1877 of the
planet Mars. Every night the observing station in Mars Bay was
carried some six or seven thousand miles by the rotation of the earth
and the planet thereby displaced among the stars by some forty sec-
onds. The heliometer is by far the most refined instrument for the
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. LO?

visual measurement of distance from star to star; the observations
extended over months instead of hours; they could be pursued without
any of the disquieting feelings that a temporary breakdown would
ruin everything; and they were brought to a successful end in a paral-
lax of 8°78 seconds. But one doubt was cast upon the result. Was it
possible that the red color of Mars had influenced the measures syste-
matically? It could not be denied that the effect of the dispersion of
the air, which gave the planet a blue fringe above that might be lost
in the blue sky, and a red fringe below that would be indistinguish-
able from the red planet itself, might have produced some effect ; and
Sir David Gill resolved to try again, utilizing this time three minor
planets farther away than Mars, with less parallax therefore but with
disks so small that they were indistinguishable from stars.

In 1888 and 1889 five observatories, the Cape in the Southern
Hemisphere, and Yale, Gottingen, Leipzig, and the Radcliffe Obser-
vatory at Oxford in the Northern Hemisphere, combined to observe
the planets Victoria, Iris, and Sappho with the heliometer. The
labor was immense. The observations proved to be so accurate that
they demanded the use in a great part of the work of eight figure
logarithms. When only a few years ago the whole work was
published in two enormous volumes of Annals of the Cape Obser-
ratory, it might well have been thought that here was the last word
of observation for many vears. Yet we are now attacking the
problem with more energy than ever.

About ten years ago the end of the century was in sight, and there
was a general impression abroad that it was time to set one’s house
in order and to make a good start on the Ist of January, 1901. The
directors of the four nautical almanaes (the British, French, German,
and American) resolved to meet in Paris in 1896, and with the help
of certain distinguished advisers to agree upon a uniform set of con-
stants to be adopted in all the Almanacs from the year 1901. Among
these constants was the solar parallax. We may summarize the infor-
mation which was at the disposal of the conference thus:

Gill’s heliometer measures of minor planets gave 8 °802 seconds, and
no other direct observational result could be compared with this; the
transits of Venus were discredited even though some of the final
results had not, and have not even now, been published. The most
recent determinations of the constant of the aberration of light gave
8-799 seconds, the parallactic inequality of the moon, 8°794 seconds.
108 NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

There were thus three powerful methods which converged upon a
‘value close to 8°80 seconds. But to set against them was a method
which we have not yet noticed.

The perturbations in the motions of other planets produced by
the earth depend upon the mass of the earth, and from them that mass
ean be determined. There is further a well-known relation between
the mass of the earth, the value of the gravitation constant, the length
of the year, and the distance of the sun, from which the latter may
therefore be derived when we know the others. Professor Newcomb
had thus determined the parallax in two different ways, and had
found two results agreeing closely among themselves, with mean 8-76
seconds, but differing widely from the others. No explanation of this
divergence could be found. But the evidence was 2 to 1 in favor of
8-80 seconds, and 8°80 seconds was adopted in 1896 as the value to be
used in all the almanacs from the beginning of this century.

It might well have been thought that the question would have been
allowed to rest there for a while. At the end of a century of labor
four principal results had emerged, and there was a majority of 3 to 1
in favor of 8°80 seconds. But there is a phenomenon, known in
politics as the swing of the pendulum or the flowing tide, by whose
operation a majority hardly won begins immediately to melt away.
A like phenomenon appears to affect the solar parallax. We have
seen how its adopted value has swung from 8°57 to 8°95 seconds, and
back again to 8°85 and 8°80 seconds. Scarcely had the resolution of
the Paris Conference been taken than the majority in favor of 8-80
secends began to melt away. The beginning of the century had been
chosen as an auspicious moment in which to make a change, without
considering that there were at the end of the preceding century many
investigations just then drawing to a close. The value of the aberra-
tion constant corresponding to 8°80 seconds is 20°478 seconds. Al-
most every determination of that constant published since 1896—and
there are many—had come out above 20°50 seconds, many of these a
long way above. Further investigation of the parallactic inequality
of the moon had not only altered the observed value of the inequality,
but had modified the theoretical relation by which the parallax is
deduced therefrom. The evidence for 8:80 seconds was giving way
badly ; and before the 1901 Almanac came into use we had this revised
table propounded by one of the chief instigators of the adoption of
8-80 seconds. The majority was now 3 to 1 in favor of a value at
least as low as 8°77 seconds.

I suppose that there will always be two opinions upon the question:
Is the adopted value of the solar parallax to depend upon direct
observation or are the indirect determinations through the constant
of aberration, the parallactic inequality, and the mass of the earth to
be allowed a weight in some proportion to their numbers? I take it
that those of us who have determined the parallax by direct obser-
vations may not unnaturally look upon these indirect methods as
interesting confirmations of our result if they agree with it, while if
they differ there must be something wrong with them. But in the
absence of a direct determination of overwhelming weight there
must always be a feeling of uneasiness when one sees three or more
results conspiring to deny the truth of one. And however that may
be, it is certainly true that about the year 1898 there was a very gen-
eral suspicion abroad that the value 8°80 seconds was too large.

At this moment there came a curious stroke of fortune. Doctor
Witt, of the Urania Sternwarte, Berlin, was engaged in a photo-

Fie. 1.—Eros campaign 1900-01. Distribution of Observatories.

graphic search for a minor planet which had long been lost. He
failed, but found instead a minor planet for which one would will-
ingly barter the remaining five hundred odd; a minor planet indeed,
but moving in a most remarkable orbit, lying for the most part
within that of Mars, very eccentric, considerably inclined to the
elliptic, and approaching the earth on favorable occasions within
about 15,000,000 miles. It was immediately recognized that here was
a new opportunity for determining the solar parallax and that the
determination must be made at once or left alone for thirty years,
for a comparatively favorable opposition was due in 1900 and no
more good ones till 1930 and 1937. At the meeting of the permanent
committee which directs the making of the astrographic chart and
‘atalogue of the whole sky it was resolved to invite a great coopera-
tion of observatories to make a combined onslaught on the problem.
The suggestion was readily taken up, with an alacrity, indeed, which
might almost have suggested that the observatories concerned had
nothing to do and were glad of a job, an imputation which is immedi-

ately rejected when one finds that some of the most energetic partici-
pants were precisely those observatories that had their hands most full
with the astrographic chart (fig. 1). By a cruel stroke of fate Sir
David Gill at the Cape was compelled to remain a spectator of the
work, for the planet came so far north that it was practically unob-
servable in the Southern Hemisphere, while in England we had the
unique spectacle of a planet north of the zenith.

Astronomy, shows very clearly the circumstances. Corresponding

positions of the earth and the planet are joined, and if we follow out
in Imagination the directions that these lines must have, remembering
that the orbit of the planet is inclined 10° to that of the earth, we
see that the planet described a loop at opposition, as all exterior
planets do, but that the loop was. of very unusual proportions
(Ginkess 33)

To discuss in any detail the circumstances of the apparition and
the way in which they can be utilized for a determination of the
parallax would take too long. But we may get a good idea of a
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. eel

fairly typical case by transplanting ourselves in imagination to the
planet Eros on the evening of the 2d of December, 1900, armed with
an imaginary telescope ridiculously out of proportion to the real size
of the planet, which is probably not more than 20 miles in diameter
(fig. 4). The earth is past inferior conjunction with the sun, and
appears as a crescent. The North Pole of the earth is tilted toward
us, and by the aid of this projection of the meridians and parallels of
latitude we can with great ease trace the path of each observatory
as it is carried round by the rotation of the earth and can measure
from the scales the angular distance at any moment of an observatory
from the center, or the distance between two observatories, which
angular distances as seen from the planet are the precise equivalents
of the parallactic diplacements of the planet as seen from the earth,

In the programme of observations there was one novel and prom-
ising feature—the application of photography. With the exception
of the transit of Venus observations, in which its success was not
striking, photography had not been previously applied in a deter-
mination of the solar parallax, for the very good reason that in
1889, at the time of the opposition of Victoria, there was practically
cnly one telescope in existence which was capable of taking photo-
graphs for exact measurement, that pioneer photographic equatorial
made by the Brothers Henry at Paris. The fact that there were in
1900 eighteen photographic telescopes engaged in observing Eros
shows how rapidly the equipment of astronomy has grown in the last
few years. We were so fortunate at Cambridge as to have our new

ea NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

photographic equatorial just completed and made to work. (I may
remark parenthetically that it took longer to make the machine
work than to build it, for when one embarks upon a large experiment
and sets up an instrument, the first of its kind, built upon improved
lines, one sets out upon a sea of troubles.)

The great advantage of the photographic method in such an under-
taking must be sufficiently well known by you. It is, of course, this,
that one is rendered very much more independent of continued fine
weather. A photograph of the planet and the surrounding’ stars
could be made in two or three minutes of actual exposure. Given an
hour’s break in the clouds, one could accumulate far more valuable

material than could be obtained in a whole night’s visual observation,
for the photograph once secured could be measured at leisure, by day
or on cloudy nights.

Throughout Europe the skies of that winter were far from clear.
Thad the pleasure at Cambridge of sitting up from dusk till dawn for
nearly three months on end and during that time had not half a
dozen nights clear right through. Had I been making visual observa-
tions I should have done little; as things turned out I was able to get
some five hundred exposures. The programme was to get four ex-
posures per hour throughout the night, making a number of exposures
on each plate, and moving the plate a little between each exposure.
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. Melis

The stars are then arranged in columns of fours; the images of the
planet, owing to its rapid motion, are in echelon.

Now each exposure gives very accurately the place of the planet
with reference to the group of stars around it, and for merely parallax
purposes the ideal would be to have pairs of such photographs taken
at the same instant at stations widely separated. By a very simple
use of the measures of some ten or twelve stars suitably disposed
ubout the planet, it would be possible to allow almost automatically
for the differences of refraction, orientation, scale value, ete., which
make the plates not immediately comparable, and to find at once the
parallactic displacement.

We have been speaking of the displacement as very large, and so
it is when compared with the displacements dealt with in previous
determinations. But look at it this way: We saw that the earth as
seen from Eros subtended an angle of 53 seconds. The seale of the
Cambridge plates is such that if we draw a circle having a diameter
of a little over 1§ mm. we represent the apparent diameter on our
plate of the earth as seen from Eros; and within that small circle the
whole of the parallactic displacement must necessarily lie. About
a millimeter was the average displacement obtained in a favorable
combination of observations, and when we consider that we are trying
to measure that with a resultant accuracy of 1 in 1,000 it does not
seem so very great after all.

We have put the problem heretofore in its very simplest form. In
actual fact the exposures at different stations were not simultaneous.
Early morning observations made at Cambridge might be contbinable
with evening observations at Lick more or less simultaneous, or with
evening observations ten or twelve hours before at (say) Oxford; or
they might have to stand alone. Any general method of utilizing all
the results must seeure the possibility of reducing each plate, so_ to
speak, on its own merits, to allow it to contribute its quota, be it
large parallactic displacement or none at all, to the general collection
of equations of condition. This requires that we shall know the
relative places of all those stars which are to be used as comparison
stars for the planet, right along the whole track of the planet. And
this derivation of a standard star system is by far the most delicate
and difficult part of the whole work. One must start with a founda-
tion of stars observed with the meridian cirele, and fill in the fainter
stars from the photographs themselves, taking care to provide at the
same time the places of all those faint comparison stars which have
been used by the visual observers. And all these places of stars must
be tied together, so to speak, by the overlapping of the photographs,
so that the system may run smoothly throughout its length. Abso-
lute errors of zero there no doubt will be, and must be, but it is
ee: NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

required that there shall be no sudden jumps in the errors exceeding
one or two hundredths of a second of are.

Now, when one comes to face a problem like this, one must inquire
very carefully what is the real accuracy of the photograph. There is
no doubt that the ordinary photographie telescope properly worked
will repeat itself very well; it will take two plates of the same region
which agree with one another excellently. But the question 1s, How
would two plates of the same region taken with different telescopes
agree? We know that individual observers have peculiarities of
their own which they can repeat almost ad infinitum. Does a photo-
graphic telescope do the same, or has it at last conquered that bad
habit of idiosynerasy which has made so much trouble in all refined
astronomical work of the older kinds? When we started on the
Eros campaign there was practically no information to be obtaimed
upon this point. «Almost all the photographic telescopes at work had
been engaged upon their own zone of the chart, and almost nothing
-was known of how the results from different instruments would com-
bine. But in our parallax problem this question is fundamental, and
must be answered as soon as possible. I therefore ventured to
propose to myself to undertake the reduction of a small section of
the photographic results, for a period of nine days in November,
1900, having before me two objects: Firstly, to discover how far it 1s
possible to combine photographs taken at different observatories, how
far, in fact, photographic telescopes are giving really accurate results
or merely reproducing their own errors; secondly, to obtain a pro-
visional value of the solar parallax, with a probable error if possible as
small as that found by Sir David Gill with the heliometer, and to find
out provisionally whether Eros was going to confirm that result or to
join in the secession from the adopted value.

Perhaps I may venture to think that the results of this enterprise
have been in some measure successful. I found that as a general
rule the results from different telescopes do not combine directly as
well as could be hoped and that there are many precautions which
must be taken in using them if we are to avoid serious systematic
error and a ruination of the parallax determination; but I believe
that it is possible to avoid these difficulties and that the photographs
properly treated will give a determination of the parallax of far
ereater accuracy than has hitherto been obtained. I found also that
the 300 exposures in that period of nine days, contributed altogether
by nine different observatories, gave a value of the solar parallax,
8-797 seconds + 0:0047 second, which is in such nice agreement with
Gill’s 8-802 seconds = 0:005 second that one may feel in one’s heart
(though of course must never express the feeling so prematurely as
this) some hope that, in adopting 8°80 seconds as the official value
of the solar parallax, the conference of 1896 was not so wrong as
some people have been prepared to believe.

I can not refrain from calling your attention to a by-product of
this work which has for me a singular interest, because it seems to
exhibit in a favorable light the accuracy which we may obtain with
these photographic methods. After Eros had been under observation
for some time it was discovered that its light was varying in a short

period, which was at first thought to be 2h. 38m. Afterwards it was
found that the alternate minima of light was unequal, and that the
true period should be reckoned as 5h. L6m., two equal maxima and
two unequal minima being included within that space of time
(fig. 5). The variation appears to be continuous, without sensible
pause, which precludes the idea that the planet is double and that the
minima are due to eclipses of one body by the other. We must find
some other cause. There are two which suggest themselves quite
naturally—irregularity of shape and irregularity of surface bright-

ness. For our purpose the important point is this—that either of
these causes might produce an apparent oscillation in the place of
the planet. To discover if this were so, I grouped the residuals in
my equations of condition according to their epoch into eight columns,
corresponding to successive eighths of the whole period of 5h. 16m.,
and took the means for each column. If there were a sensible
oscillation in a period of 5h. 16m., these would lie on a sine curve.
They obviously do not; there is no sensible oscillation in that period
(fig. 6). But notice that if we add together the first and fifth, the
second and sixth, and so on—-that is to say, if we search for the half
period of 2h. 38m.—we get quite strong evidence of periodicity (fig. 7).
116 NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

Now, the semiamplitude of the oscillation is only 0°08 second, a
quantity so small that one can not but feel doubts as to its reality.
At first I was myself inclined to disbeheve; but when a new distribu-
tion of the residuals, starting from a different zero of time, gave a
similar periodicity, 1t began to look as if there were something in it.
The more I look at it the more I believe that it is a reality, and that
the photographs have shown themselves accurate enough to detect an
inequality of 0°03 second, corresponding to a shift of 5 miles at a
distance of 25,000,000 miles—by far the smallest inequality in the
motion of a planet ever brought to hght by observation.

It is this circumstance that encourages one to believe in the accu-
racy of the photographs. There are altogether 10,000 separate expo-
sures of the planet which will within the next few years be meas-
ured and made available for discussion. If 300 give a P. E. of
0-005 second, what will 10,000 give, added to 6,000 or 7,000 sets of

visual observations? It would be going too far to apply the simple
rules of probability and say a good deal less than 0-001 second. But
JI fully believe that if this great array of observations is ever sub-
mitted to complete discussion the probable error of the result will not
be much above 0-001 second. And supposing that it should support
with its greater weight the value 8°80 seconds which has been
assailed, I believe that we should be justified in saying that the solar
parallax is 8°80 seconds, and in maintaining the proposition that the
determination of the solar parallax is a problem of geometry and
celestial surveying, and that upon the sponsors of the indirect meth-
ods lies the onus of showing cause for their disagreement.

This opens up an interesting prospect. Suppose that in course
of time there should come to be a clear and definite agreement among
the values found for the constant of the aberration of ight, and that
its value was (let us say) 20°54 seconds, corresponding, as this table
shows, to a parallax of 8-77 seconds, not 8°80 seconds, on the assump-
tion at least that the velocity of light is exactly determined, as it
seems to be, and that the simple theory of aberration is correct.

And suppose that by that time we are prepared to say quite defi-
nitely that the geometrical value is not 8°77 seconds but 8°80 seconds.
The most obvious solution of the difficulty would be to conclude that
the simple theory of aberration is not true, and to hand over the
problem to the mathematical physicists, who might in the result find
that a definite geometrical determination of the solar parallax had
provided just. the criterion which they required to settle certain vexed
questions in dynamics.

Again, should further investigation confirm the conclusion that
8-76 seconds is the only value of the solar parallax which ~ will
reconcile the existing theory of the motion of the planet with the
observed value of the constant of gravitation, it may be that the con-
tradiction between the direct and the indirect methods will at last
enable the dynamical astronomers to lay a finger upon that flaw
which exists somewhere or other in the theory and makes it impossi-
ble to say at the present time that all the motions of the. solar system
can be completely explained.

I have ventured to point out that the determination of the solar
parallax is a problem of wide interest, since it throws upon so many
different people the task of keeping up their particular end against an
attack whose accuracy is gradually becoming more and more deadly.
The dimensions of the earth, as obtained by geodetic operations, are
necessarily beyond the reach of any criticism derived from solar
parallax results.

But it is interesting to speculate whether astronomers will ever be
in the position to say, “ We have now determined the solar parallax
in seconds of are to a higher degree of accuracy than that of the
measurement of the earth,” and to call upon geodesists for better re-
sults. I can conceive only one direction in which we may be able to
worry the successors in your corps of Everest and Clarke. Is the
form of the equator a circle or an ellipse? I believe that there is
some slight evidence for ellipticity, and that it has been put as high
as one in three thousand. If that is so, it is just barely possible that
we may have to introduce into the computation of the parallax factors
for different observatories a term depending upon the shape of the
equator. But I confess that this prospect is remote, and that for
inany years, in all probability, geodesists who achieve accuracies of
fne in a hundred thousand and even talk of one in a million will be
able to take a serene view of the labors of astronomers to arrive at
the distance of the sun to one part in ten thousand.
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH A MOVING
CAMERA.*

By ALEX LARSEN. Chicago, II].

Lightning, with its accompaniment of thunder, has always ex-
erted a fascinating influence on the thinking mind. It is not strange
that a people living in an age when the laws of nature were less per-
feetly understood should have associated this beautiful and awe-
inspiring natural phenomenon with the powers and attributes of
their gods.

The ancient Norsemen recognized in the rumbling of the thunder
the approach of Thor, their most powerful god, in his heavenly
chariot, drawn by his two he goats; and in the hghtning flash they
saw the path cleaved through the air by the never-failing hammer
“ Mjolner,” wielded by the mighty arm of Thor when battling with
the enemies of the gods, the hammer always returning to his hand.
The myth is beautiful, and it would seem as if its authors had noticed
the peculiar flickering of most lightning flashes and associated it
with the forward and return movement of the hammer.

The principal object of this paper is to place before its readers
certain facts to account for this flickering of lightning flashes.

In the latter part of the summer of 1901, while taking somegordi-
nary pictures of lightning, the idea occurred to the writer while
noticing this flickering that if the camera be moved in a circle at
right angle to the flash the picture ought to show a widening of the
flash, if it was composed of separate parts, and thereby also deter-
mine its duration. The attempt to do this was made that year, but
without success. It was repeated again in 1902, and on July 17
several successful exposures were made which clearly showed that
most flashes are composed of several discharges following one another
at certain intervals in the path made by the first discharge. The
writer was unaware at the time that others had experimented in the
same line and had published their results.

a@The study of lightning flashes herewith presented was aided by a grant
from the Hodgkins Fund of the Smithsonian Institution,
: 119
120 PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA.

The camera was moved by hand, being swung from right to left
and back again, each swing lasting about one second and covering an
angle of about 60°, which was also the angle of the lens. .The ap-
paratus employed was an ordinary magazine plate camera, which
for all ordinary purposes is the most convenient on account of the
rapidity with which the plates can be changed, this being cf great
importance, because, as a rule, the time most favorable for obtaining
good pictures is very short, seldom lasting longer than from ten
to fifteen minutes.

Several more pictures were obtained in 1903. The three most in-
teresting ones up to that year are shown in figures 1,2, and 3. (See
plates.) Figure 1 shows a flash obtained on July 17, 1902. The dis-
charge took place between two clouds. It will be noticed that it is
composed of a number of separate discharges (or rushes) and bands;
as many as thirty-four can be counted on the negative. As the flash
covers about half of the plate, and as the approximate speed of the
‘amera was about one second to cover the plate, or 60°, it follows that
the approximate duration of this flash was about half a second. Fig-
ure 2 shows a flash obtained on July 11,1903. This flash is interesting
for several reasons. It is composed of fourteen separate discharges,
the first one being the brightest, and having side branches pointing
downward, proving that the first discharge passed from the cloud
to the earth and that the resistance which it had to overcome must
have been excessive (the side branches prove that). At a distance
of 3 millimeters from the first rush is another discharge following
the same path, but without side branches (what appear as such are
really branches from the first rush). At a distance of 12°5 milli-
ineters from the last discharge will be seen two rushes 0°5 millimeter
apart, and from there for a distance of 10 millimeters are a series
of discharges close together, forming a broad band. The dark space
which divides this flash is a cloud through which the discharge is
passing. Another interesting fact about this flash is that the path
of it is spiral shaped, the motion is from right to left, or opposite to
the motion of the hands of a clock, looking downward from the
cloud. Figure 3 was obtained October 1, 1903. We have here a flash
composed, first, of two bright discharges close together, then there
appears to be an interval of about a fourth of a seeond, which in all
probability was filled in with a number of fainter oscillations (the
lines running across seem to indicate that), and at the conclusion
of the flash are four fairly bright rushes.

In the summer of 1904 copies of some of the photographs were
sent to the Smithsonian Institution for examination, and through the
suggestions and assistance of the experts of that Institution a new
method of moving the camera was devised.
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA. 121

A spring-motor movement (of the kind used to operate revolving
stands for exhibiting goods in show windows) was procured and
mounted inside a table specially constructed for the purpose, and a
stand for supporting the cameras was fitted to the central shaft.

As the speed of the motor was too slow, the fly-vane shaft was re-
moved and the vane moved to the next shaft, which was lengthened
so as to extend under the table. Thus arranged the fly vane
could be made to revolve in a liquid placed in a vessel under
the table, thereby preventing much of the vibration and_ get-
iing a more uniform speed. Figure 4 shows the arrangement of
the apparatus. The table top is removed in order to show how the
motor movement is placed; the fly vane is seen under the table. The
stand is usually revolved at a speed of one revolution in ten sec-
onds, which the writer has found to be the most suitable for ordinary
purposes. The reason for employing a motor movement with a
uniform speed to move the camera is to ascertain the exact duration
of a flash or the intervals between the rushes.

If the angle of the lens and the speed of the camera be known, it
is a simple matter of measurement to ascertain the duration of a
flash. The formula employed is as follows:

Call the angle of the lens (in degrees) =A°

Time for one rotation of stand (in seconds) =T

Width of plate (in millimeters )=W

Width of flash measured on plate (in millimeters) =N

AS
mat
Then time for flash (in seconds) — —- XN

The measurements should be taken from the middle of the plate,
owing to the distortion of the lens.

A number of photographs have been taken by this method, and
about nine out of ten show the multiplicity of a flash. The average
number of rushes for each flash is about five or six, and the time
varies from an almost instantaneous value up to about half a second
for a complete discharge.

The most interesting discharge obtained is shown in figure 5. It
was taken September 1, 1905, at 9 p. m. The storm during which
this flash was photographed began about 7 p. m., with the wind
northeast, which is something very unusual for Chicago. The wind
gradually changed to north and northwest. The temperature during
the storm was about 24° C., and the barometer varied between 29°89
and 29°92. The flash was obtained when the storm was most severe
and while it was raining very hard.

This flash is composed of forty separate discharges, made up of
one band, which in all probability is composed of a number of sepa-

sm 1905——12
122 PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA.

rate rushes or oscillations very close together and one black dis-
charge. It is this dark discharge which makes this flash interesting,
and the photograph shows it running parallel and on both sides of
the first bright rush, extending 0.6 millimeter on one side and 0.1
millimeter on the other, the boundary line on the latter side not being
very marked. From this black discharge issue several side branches
on both sides, a large one spreading out over the other rushes quite
prominently. These side branches all pointing downward indicate
that the black flash was a downward stroke, and they also tend to
prove that it must have had a good deal of resistance to overcome.
Tt must have cleared the way for the first bright discharge, which in
all probability proceeded from the ground upward. ‘The difference
in width of the bright flash, measured at its lower and upper part,
would confirm this opinion, being for the lower part 0.88 millimeter
and for the upper part 0.22 millimeter.

An interesting question here presents itself. Have we here two
separate discharges with different rates of oscillation traveling the
same path? Can such a condition be possible? To the writer’s
mind the most plausible explanation would be that the two dis-
charges occupied two separate paths, one imside of the other, one
discharge forming, so to speak, a tube through which the other passed.

It may also be claimed that the bright flash is probably part of the
dark discharge for some reason rendered more lumimous. This
explanation may be the true one, although it appears as if the bright
flash is entirely separate. The measurements of the width of the
upper and lower parts of both flashes confirm this opinion, the
difference in width of the bright flash being 40 per cent and for the
dark discharge only 20 per cent. Authorities vary in their opinions
as to the probable cause of these dark flashes. It has been suggested
by some that there really are no black discharges, but what appear
as such are excessively bright flashes causing a reversal of the image
on the plate. This explanation may be the true one if we under-
stand the word * brightness ” to mean increased actinic power of the
light. In the black flash represented this chemical effect must have
been extremely high, owing to the fact that the smallest hair-like
extremities of the side branches are well reproduced on the picture
as black, in comparison with the broader and to all appearance more
powerful discharges which followed after.

It was at first thought probable that we had to deal with an inter-
ference phenomenon, but that idea was discarded. Then it was
suggested that the black discharge was probably due to slow oscilla-
tions (the width of it would tend to confirm this opinion), and that
what appeared as black on the plate would in reality be a dark red
discharge on a partially illuminated background. This opinion had
to be discarded for the reason that, if such be the case, the side
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA. 123

branches of the dark flash would have been obliterated by the other
rushes following. The effect of halation and solarization was also
considered, but rejected. There was thus but one way to account for
the phenomenon, namely, that the flash must have given out ligh!
of a wave length much shorter than the wave lengths of visible light
and with a power sufficient to render the portion of the plate struck
by it nonsensitive to ordinary light. Such a flash would appear
biack on a partially illuminated background or be invisible.

Dark flashes have been observed by the writer on several occasions
and only when raining very hard. They appear to the eye the same
as the accidental image produced after looking at a bright flash.
Such an image may be retained in the eye for quite a while after, but
‘an. not easily be confounded with a real flash.

Two other pictures of dark discharges have been obtained with
the moving camera, but are not so prominent; they likewise show the
first rush as black, but without a bright core and with no side
branches; one is of a horizontal and the other a vertical flash.

Below is a table of the measurements of this flash. The angle of
the lens was 60°. Time of rotation of camera, 1 revolution in 10
seconds. Width of plate, 127 millimeters. .The width of the whole
flash, 48 millimeters. Time for the whole flash, 0.624 second. The
average distance between the rushes, 1.2 millimeters. Average time
for each rush, 0.0156 second. The plate used was a “ Standard ”
ordinary plate. The contrast of the picture has been increased by
means of a double-contact print with lantern-slide plates. The
developer was “ Rodinal.” Time for developing, five minutes.

In the summer of 1905 a new departure was undertaken by the
writer at the suggestion of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the object being to obtain spectrum photographs of lightning.

Spectroscopic examinations of hghtning have been made by many,
but most of these observations have been visual, which at their best
ean only be rough approximations of the number of lines and their
relative positions. As far as the writer knows, only one institution
in the country—the Harvard College Observatory—had undertaken
any work in photographing the spectrum of lightning.

A crude apparatus was constructed, consisting of a camera with a
35-mnillimeter prism fitted in front of the lens, no slit being used, as
a lightning flash is a relatively narrow streak of light yielding a prac-
tically parallel beam. By.means of this arrangement a few photo-
graphs have been obtained, two of which are reproduced in figures 6
and 7. A spectrum photograph of a spark from a static machine, for
comparison, is shown in figure 8,

The spectrum shown in figure 6 is from a vertical flash, the picture
of which was obtained June 18, 1905. It was about 14 miles distant
and was taken at the end of a storm of local character. The spec-
trum of this flash resembles that from the static machine in most of
its details,
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA. 125

Figure 7 shows the spectrum of one of those horizontal meandering
flashes often seen at the conclusion of a storm of long duration. It
was obtained September 1, 1905. It differs considerably from figures
6 and 8, several lines being absent. The first line of this spectrum is
probably the same as the eighth line of the spark spectrum.

No definite opinion can at present be offered by the writer as to the
meaning of these changes of the lnes in the spectra of different
flashes; more material must be obtained before a positive statement
can be made.

Below is a table of measurements of the three spectra and their
probable relations. Several measurements have been taken, and the
nverage are here presented .

It may not be out of place here to give a few brief hints as to the
best method for obtaining lightning photographs, for the benefit of
the large number of amateur photographers scattered over the world.
Thunder storms are nearly always cyclonic in their character, their
diameter varying. When they extend over large areas it will usually
be found that most of the vertical flashes are at the circumference of
the circle through which the storm is passing. In the central part of
a storm the flashes are usually horizontal, or passing between two
4

126 PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA.

strata of clouds, therefore the best time for obtaining photographs
is either at the beginning or the end of a storm. At the beginning
the wind is usually very strong, hindering the work, so that it is gener-
erally best to wait until the front of the storm has just passed overhead
and then to expose the camera from a window or other suitable place
facing a direction opposite to that of the wind. In this way the
camera as well as the person will be protected from the wind and rain.
This rule holds good in most cases, although there are many excep-
tions, especially when the storm is local in character and of small
extent. A person must be on the lookout at all times and note the
direction in which most of the downward strokes appear and direct
the camera toward them. ;

It is useless to expose plates when there is nothing but sheet lght-
ning, for it will only result in spoiling them. Oftentimes there is ¢
mixture of sheet lhghtning and a few scattered ground strokes at
aneertain points. When that be the case, the chances for obtaining
pictures are shght, the sheet lightning soon fogging the plates, the
time for fogging in such cases being from five to ten minutes, depend-
ing on the frequency of the reflections. The best rule to follow is to
wait until a favorable opportunity presents itself, when the flashes
are about half a mile distant, then act quickly, have plenty of plates
ready to imsert in place of the exposed ones, and trust to luck. The
best way of holding the camera when swung by hand is to place it
close to the body, tilting it somewhat upward, so as to get as much as
possible of the sky in the picture, and swinging the body from side
to side. The time and angle of the swing can be regulated with a
little practice so as to be fairly accurate, say one second to the swing,
although the writer has found by experience that when a sudden
flash appears in front of the camera the evenness of the swing will be
somewhat disturbed, particularly if the flash is close to the observer,
unless the person be in possession of unusually strong nerves. When
pictures of horizontal flashes are desired the camera must naturally
have an up and down swing. These flashes are usually less intense
and the pictures of them sometimes require a very long time to
develop.

The developer preferred by the writer is “ Rodinal,” being con-
venient and clean, although any good developer will do, particularly
such contrast developers as “ Glycin ” or “ Hydrochinon.”

Different kinds of plates have been tried, but the writer has no
special preference for any one of the standard plates. The ortho-
chromatic plates do not seem to give better results than the ordinary
ones. Tilms give trouble in developing, because each exposure must
be developed separately. ;

Figure 9 shows the barometer devised by the writer, which he has
found very useful in the study of the variations of the atmospheric
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA. 127

pressure preceding and during storms. The instrument recommends
itself on account of the simplicity of its construction, its accuracy,
and the ease with which the readings can be made, less than one two-
hundredth part of an inch being easily read off without the aid of a
vermer.

The instrument shown in the illustration consists of a glass tube,
one-fourth inch inside diameter, 38 inches long, bent to an angle of
100° at a distance of 84 inches from the closed end, filled with mer-
cury, and mounted with the open end dipping into a reservior, which
in this case is 1 inch in diameter. The open end can also be bent up
to form a siphon barometer. The scale is placed along the upper
slanting part of the tube. A pointer is fastened to the lower part of
the instrument, the use of which is to indicate when it is in an exact
vertical position, a mark on the wall indicating this position. The
surface tension of the mercury is overcome by gently swinging the
instrument and returning it to its vertical position. The calibration
may be done by comparison with a standard instrument or by actual
measurements. The bend of the tube may be made at a different
angle, but should not be much less than 100° owing to the surface
tension of the mercury. With this angle the instrument will mag-
nify about six times, which has been found by the writer to be sufli-
cient for ordinary use. The range of the instrument described is
about 2 inches, and if a greater range is desired the slanting portion
of the tube may be made longer or a different angle of the bend be
substituted, although the proportions given have been found by
experience to give the best satisfaction. A tube with a small internal
diameter does not give good satisfaction owing to the surface tension
being greater.

THE TANTALUM LAMP:

By Dr. W. von Boiron and Dr. O. FEUERLEIN.

Parr I.—By Dr. W. von Botron.

Whilst the carbon-filament incandescent lamp remained for nearly
two decades the sole representative of glow-lamp manufacture, prog-
ress was being quietly made in this art. The firm of Messrs. Siemens
& Halske has for many years been working at a solution of the prob-
lem of an economical incandescent lamp, and arrived, some time ago,”
at the fundamental principle that the visible part of the radiation of
an incandescent body increases progressively with its temperature.
This warrants the postulate that the most economical lamp will be
that whose incandescent material will withstand the highest tem-
perature.

Messrs. Siemens & Halske had arrived at this conclusion and
charged me several years ago with the task of discovering a material
which should have a melting point considerably above the tempera-
ture at which incandescent hghting becomes highly economical, so
that filaments made of such a material would not melt or disintegrate
at that temperature. Whilst our laboratory work, founded upon
this idea, was going on, the first two advances in incandescent light-
ing were made public, one being the “ Nernst” and the other the
“Osmium ” lamp.

There are certain metals the melting points of which are known to
be considerably above 2,000° C., and the task resolved itself into find-
ing one which, while fulfilling the above requirement, could be easily
worked to form a filament, and not be very rare or difficult to pro-
cure. It was early observed that brown vanadium pentoxide, which,
according to Berzelius, does not conduct electricity, is, as a matter of

fact, a conductor even when cold. This observation induced me to
try whether vanadic acid could not be electrolytically decomposed.
tn this I succeeded, but the melting point of the vanadium obtained
proved too low for the purpose in view. Since the metals niobium
and tantalum are members of the vanadium group, niobium having
an atomic weight double that of vanadium, while the atomic weight
of tantalum is double that of niobium, it was thought that one or both
of these metals might prove to have the desired qualities. On ex-
perimenting with niobium on the lnes adopted for vanadium it ap-
peared that this metal has a considerably higher melting point than
ihat of vanadium, but not, however, sufficiently high. Moreover,
some of the niobium filaments which I made had a very strong ten-
dency to break up when heated by the electric current.

Tantalum was tried next. I reduced potassium tantalo-fluoride
in the manner prescribed by Berzelius and Rose and found that the
finely divided tantalum so produced became fairly coherent on roll-
ing, so that by this treatment metallic strips of it could be made. It
was also attempted to work tantalum oxide into the shape of a fila-
ment by mixing it with paraffin and to reduce it directly imto the
form of a metallic thread. In these experiments there was observed
for the first time a minute globule of molten tantalum, and this
globule was of sufficient toughness to permit hammering and draw-
ing into wire. Following out this observation, tantalum powder was
melted in a vacuum, and then it was found that the highly heated
metal parted with the gases it contained. In this manner I pro-
duced my first filaments of pure metallic tantalum, which were,
however, very small. When these had been used in lamps with
promise of good results, an attempt was made to devise a definite
process of purification. The potassium tantalo-fluoride was reduced
to metallic powder; this powder contains a small proportion of oxide
and of hydrogen which is absorbed during the reduction. When the
powder was melted in a vacuum the oxide and absorbed gas disap-
peared and a reguline metal remained; on carefully remelting this it
became so pure that no appreciable impurities could be detected in it.

The chemical properties of this pure tantalum are very remark-
able, and some of them are of such a nature as to lead me to suppose
that nobody other than myself has ever had metallic tantalum in
his hands. When cold, the material strongly resists chemical re-
agents; it is not attacked by boiling hydrochloric acid, aqua regia,
nitric acid, or sulphuric acid, and it is also indifferent to alkaline
solutions; it is attacked solely by hydrofluoric acid. Following the
behavior of steel, when heated in the air it assumes a yellow tint at
about 400° C., and the tint changes to dark blue when the tantalum
is exposed for some time to 500° C., or for a shorter time to 600° C.
Thin wires of the substance burn with low intensity and without

any noticeable flame when ignited. It absorbs hydrogen as well as
nitrogen with great avidity, even at a low red heat, and forms with
them combinations of a metallic appearance, but rather brittle. It
combines with carbon very easily, forming several carbides which,
as far as they are at present known, are all of metallic appearance,
but also very hard and brittle. The product which Moissan thought
to be tantalum was clearly a carbide of this nature or an alloy of a
earbide with pure tantalum, for Moissan himself stated that his metal
still contained one-half per cent of carbon. Considering the high
atomic weight of tantalum (183) it is obvious that a very small quan-
tity of carbon suffices to carburize a relatively large quantity of
tantalum. This view of the constitution of Moissan’s product is
confirmed by the properties he ascribed to the metal—namely, spe-
cific gravity 12°8, great hardness and brittleness. These are not
properties of pure tantalum. When in the form of powder, still
containing, as previously stated, oxide and hydrogen, the specific
gravity of my material is about 14; when purified by fusion and
drawn into wire it has a specific gravity of 16°8. It is somewhat
darker than platinum, and has a hardness about equal to that of
mild steel, but shows greater tensile strength than steel does. It is
malleable, although the effect of hammering is relatively small, so
that the operation must be rather long and severe to beat the metal
into a sheet. It can be rolled, as well as drawn, into very fine wire.
Its tensile strength as a wire is remarkably high, and amounts to 95
kilograms per square millimeter, while the corresponding figure for
good steel is 70 to 80 kilograms, according to Kohlrausch.

The electrical resistance of the material at indoor temperature is
0-165 ohm for a length of 1 meter and a section of 1 square milli-
meter (specific conductivity as compared with mercury 6:06). The
temperature coefficient is positive and has a value of 0°30 between
0° C. and 100° C. At the temperature assumed by the incandescent
filament in the lamp at 1°5 watts per candlepower, the resistance
rises to 0°830 ohm for a length of 1 meter and a section of 1 square
millimeter. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion between
0° C. and 60° C. is 0:0000079, according to experiments made by the
Imperial Normal-Aichungs commission. Fusion is preceded by a
gradual softening, which appears to extend over a range of tempera-
ture of several hundred degrees. The specific heat is 0°0365, so that
the atomic heat is 6°64, which is in accord with the law established

by Dulong and Petit.
Part II.—By Dr. O. FEurr.ein.

The results of the work carried out in our chemical laboratory, as
described by Doctor von Bolton in the first part of this paper, were,
of course, of the utmost interest to our incandescent lamp manufac-

turing department. As soon as Doctor Bolton’s experiments showed
that the originally brittle tantalum could be made ductile enough to
draw into wire by the usual methods, and that this wire could be bent
and coiled like a thin steel wire, it became possible to test it thor-
oughly as to its usefulness for incandescent lamps. The first trials
with wires of about 0°3 millimeter diameter gave most promising
results. They confirmed the fact that tantalum has a very high melt-
ing pomt and that it is but shehtly subject to disintegration in a
vacuum, even when subjected to a heavy current.

The first tantalum lamp that proved moderately satisfactory in that
it admitted of an exact measurement of the electric photometric
conditions and stood a burning test for some time, was completed
just over two years ago, viz, on December 28, 1902. This lamp had
a loop-shaped filament made of the first tantalum wire ever drawn.
The diameter of the wire was 0°28 millimeter, its effective hghting
length 54 millimeters, and its electrical resistance when cold 0°29
ohm. This corresponds to a specific resistance (1 meter length, 1
square millimeter section) of 0°331. The photometric measurements
made at efficiencies of 2, 14, and 1 watt per Hefner candlepower
showed potential differences of 4:9, 4°95, and 5-9 volts, currents of
5, 5°46, and 6°2 amperes, and illuminating values of 11, 18, and 37
Hefner candlepower, respectively. On being burnt at 1 watt per
candlepower the lamp had a life of twenty hours, during which it
blackened considerably.

As the chemical and mechanical manufacturing processes devel-
oped and the material became purer and the wires more uniform, the
results obtained also improved. The lamps lasted longer and black-
ened less; at the same time the specific resistance decreased until it
had dropped to the present figure of 0-165 for the pure metal. It is
clear that the material used for the first lamps still contained a con-
siderable quantity of impurities, probably niobium and _ carbides,
which caused the great disintegration and the nearly double specific
resistance. During these first trials we looked very carefully into
the question as to what dimensions the filament of a tantalum lamp
ought to have for ordinary voltages and illuminating values. From
the dimensions of the filament used in the first lamp we calculated
that, with this rather impure material, we should require a filament
about 520 millimeters long and 0:06 millimeter diameter for a lamp
for 110 volts, 32 Hefner candlepower, and 1°5 watts per candle-
power. These unusual figures increased when the specific resistance
of the material had diminished to the present value of 0°165, at which,
for a 82 Hefner candlepower lamp, a filament of about 700 milli-
meters in length by 0°055 millimeter in diameter was required; for
a 25 Hefner candlepower lamp a filament of about 650 millimeters
by 0:05 millimeter diameter was required. Thus, in order to con-
THE TANTALUM LAMP. has

struct a practical and useful lamp for standard voltages and illu-
minating values, we had to solve the problem of drawing the tanta-
lum wire in sufficient length down to a diameter of 0:05 millimeter
to 0-06 millimeter; this we succeeded in doing after long and labori-
ous trials. i

In July, 1903, we possessed the first tantalum lamp with a filament
of about 0-05 millimeter diameter. It had a loop-shaped filament 54
millimeters long, and it took 0°58 amperes at 9 volts and gave 3:5
- Hefner candlepower at 1°5 watts per candlepower. On the basis
of these figures a lamp having the same quality and diameter of wire
and working at the same efficiency on a 110-volt circuit would have
a filament 650 millimeters long and would give 43 Hefner candle-
power. The experiments thus far had proved that the task of pro-
ducing lamps for 110 volts and a maximum of 25 to 32 Hefner candle-
power was not an easy one in several respects. We had to solve the
problem of suitably and reliably fixing a filament rather more than
2 feet long within a glass globe which should not exceed to any great
extent the dimensions of the usual incandescent lamps. The first
and most obvious attempt was made, of course, by adhering to the
loop shape and accommodating the required length of wire by connect-
ing several such bows in series within the lamp. However, lamps
made according to this plan with two to four tantalum loops gave
results which were anything but satisfactory.

It appeared that, like all other metallic filaments which have hith-
erto been used for incandescent lamps, tantalum wire softens sensibly
at the temperature attained when worked at 1°5 watts per candle-
power. To use loop-shaped or spiral filaments similar to the carbon
filaments of the common incandescent lamps was, therefore, out of
the question. There was no difficulty in suspending the loops, but in
that case the lamps would have to be used exclusively in a vertical
position, a limitation which we wished to avoid in all circumstances.
Besides, such a construction would necessitate staying the loops firmly
to prevent them from becoming entangled with each other during
transport of the lamps. Nor did lamps made with loops of corrugated
wire (fig. 1) or of plain or corrugated metal ribbon give satisfaction ;
for although the loops were certainly shortened in this way, there
were other drawbacks which caused us to abandon this construction.
It soon became apparent that the one road to success lay in the direc-
tion of dividing the filament into a number of short straight lengths
supported at their ends by insulated holders. In this manner we suc-
ceeded at last, in September, 1903, in producing the first really sery-
iceable lamps for about 110 volts. This lamp is illustrated in figure 2.
and it will be seen that it contains two glass disks cast to a central
wire holder; each disk carries laterally twelve arms having small
hooks at their ends and insulated from each other. Through these

twenty-four hooks the thin tantalum wire is drawn up and down be-
tween the two disks. This is believed to be the first metallic incan-
descent lamp for nearly 110 volts which, lke the common carbon
glow lamp, can burn in any position whatsoever. This lamp sup-
plied about 30 Hefner candlepower on a 94-volt circuit at 1°5 watts
per candlepower. It lasted for 260 hours, and lost during that time
9-5 per cent of its illuminating power.

After this first practical success we redoubled our efforts to improve
the lamp further. As far back as about the middle of October, 1903, .

we succeeded in making the first 200-volt tantalum lamp, which was
of a design similar to the lamp just described, but with eighteen arms
on each disk and with a greater distance between the two disks. I
may add at once that it is of interest only as a curiosity, for it has
served no practical purpose. The length of its filament was 1,350
millimeters and the illuminating value about 60 Hefner candle-
power. In the course of further development the form of the frame
of wire filament for the 110-volt lamp went through different stages,
the principle of subdivision being always followed. Among other
constructions, we tried some in which, instead of one long filament,
THE TANTALUM LAMP. 135

a number of short pieces of wire were fixed on a supporting frame:
these pieces, connected in series, made up the total length required.
Figure 3 represents a lamp thus constructed, the wire being fixed
obliquely in sixteen straight pieces between two insulated supporting
stars. Such lamps offer the advantage that short pieces of filament
ean be used in the manufacture, but they are only reliable if the
wires used in the same lamp
are absolutely uniform in di-
ameter and quality. In the
end we arrived at the shape
represented in figure +, which
is for 110 volts, 25 candle-
power, and 1-5 watts per
Hefner candlepower. In this
form, differing from most of
the previous constructions, the
central support consists of a
short glass rod carrying two
disks, into which the arms,
bent upward and downward
in the shape of an umbrella,
are cast. The upper star has
eleven, the lower twelve arms,
each upper arm being in a ver-
tical plane midway between
the vertical planes in which
two adjacent lower arms lie.
Between these eleven and

twelve arms, which are bent
into hooks at their ends, the
entire length of the filament
is drawn in a zigzag fashion.
Its extremities, held by two of
the lower arms, are connected
with the foot of the lamp by
means of platinum strips.
The standard type for 110
volts 25 Hefner candlepower and 1-5 watts per candlepower has a
filament 650 millimeters long and 0-05 millimeters in diameter. The
weight of this filament is 0-022 gram, so that about 45,000 lamps
contain together 1 kilogram of tantalum. The shape of the glass
globe is adapted to the frame described above. Care has been
taken to make it of a size not exceeding the usual maximum dimen-
sions of common incandescent lamps of the same candlepower

[—/

136 THE TANTALUM LAMP.

(25 Hefner candlepower 110 volts). This shape offers a number
of noticeable advantages. In the first instance it is very stable
and will stand strong shocks without damage to the lamp. <A con-
siderable number of such lamps sent across the sea to test their ability
to withstand the hardships of transport came back unhurt, although
they had been packed just ke common glow lamps, and no
special care in any respect had been taken in their handling. The
lamp burns, of course, in any position, and can therefore be held in
any kind of fitting. The light is rather white and agreeable, and its
effect is particularly uniform if the lamp is provided with a ground-
glass globe.

We shall now proceed to describe the electric and photometric
properties of the lamp and its behavior in actual use. Numerous
trials for lengthy periods of time at 1 to 3 watts per candlepower
have proved the vast superiority of the tantalum lamp over the
carbon filament lamp under equal electric and photometric conditions.
Expressing this fact in figures, we can state that the tantalum lamp
consumes about 50 per cent less current at the same voltage, with the
same intensity of hght and the same useful life; or that, at the same
economy, its life is several times that of the carbon type. Moreover,
at an initial efficiency of 1°5 volts per Hefner candlepower the tanta-
tum lamp has an average life quite sufficient for all practical require-
ments, so that this rating has been standardized for the 110-volt
lamp. Trials have also proved that the lamps have a life of several
hundred hours at 1 watt per Hefner candlepower, but in that case
they were very sensitive to variations of pressure and often showed
an early decrease of illuminating power. The useful life of the
tantalum lamp—i. e., the time within which it loses 20 per cent of
its initial illuminating power—averages between 400 and 600 hours
at 1°5 watts per Hefner candlepower. Some specimens have proved
to have a useful life of as much as 1,200 hours. The absolute life, in
general, amounts to 800-1,000 hours under normal working conditions.
Further, we have to remark that the tantalum lamp blackens but

little unless it has been strongly overheated during work in conse-
quence of partial short-circuiting of the filament.

It is very interesting to observe the behavior of the tantalum
lamp during the whole course of its life. The first fact worthy of
note is that, like some carbon lamps, the illuminating value increases
at the beginning, generally after a few hours, by 15 to 20 per cent.
In the same way the consumption of current rises by about 3 to
6 per cent, while the consumption-of energy drops to 1:3 to 1:4
watts per candlepower. After that the illuminating value gradually
decreases, while a corresponding increase of the consumption of
energy occurs. The average behavior of the 25-candlepower. lamp

the following table:

The initial increase of illuminating value and of current consumed
is doubtless caused by a change in the structure of the tantalum
wire, this change being ac-
companied by a reduction
of resistance and, conse-
quently, of the phenomena
resulting therefrom. We
may say at once that after
a certain amount of use the
filament presents a radical
change in appearance when
viewed with the naked eye.
While the fresh filament
has a perfectly smooth and
cylindrical surface, it ac-
quires a peculiarly glisten-
ing aspect as it grows old,
so that a lamp having

from a new lamp. When
looked at under the microscope, the filament that has burned for a
length of time shows a clear tendency toward cont action and forma-
tion of drops or beads. Figure 5 is an illustration of a piece of
filament in its fresh state and of the same piece after 1,000 hours of
service, the specimen in each case being magnified one hundred times.
This gradual shortening of the filament can also be observed in the
lamps themselves, and offers a further indication of the age of a lamp.
Figure 6 represents the filament frame of a new lamp. It will be
noticed that the tantalum wire is led up and down and hangs loose
on the supporting frame in easy wide arches, without sharp bends.

138 THE TANTALUM LAMP.

But after being used for some time the aspect of the lamp is quite
different. As shown in figure 7, the wire has contracted, the wide
arches have disappeared and sharp-pointed angles have taken their
place.

The behavior of these lamps is most peculiar when the filament
has burnt through. While with all other incandescent lamps the
burning through of the filament is tantamount to the economical
death of the lamp, it may happen with tantalum lamps that they
burn through several times without being rendered useless; on the
contrary, each burning through is followed by an increase, often
considerable, of the illuminating power. This peculiar result is
due to the fact that in many cases a broken wire comes in contact
with its neighbor, so that the circuit is again established. A part

of the filament is thus cut out of the circuit, and the lamp conse-
quently burns more intensely, and sometimes even too intensely, in
which case, of course, only a short span of life is left to it. Yet we
have had more than one lamp under observation, the filament of
which broke for a first time after a short period of service and then
broke repeatedly, but notwithstanding this the lamp lived more than
1,000 hours. We have often succeeded in rendering a lamp with a
broken filament serviceable again by tapping it to bring the broken
piece into contact with its neighbor. Figure 8 represents the frame
of a lamp in which the filament was burnt through in three places,
and yet continued to do service. For the sake of clearness, the
back spans of the filament have been omitted in the drawing, while
the front spans which were carrying the current are drawn in
specially heavy lines.
THE TANTALUM LAMP. 139

It must further be mentioned that after serving for some time,
say 200 to 300 hours, the tantalum filament loses a great deal of its
mechanical resistance, while, as has been stated by Doctor Von
Bolton, tantalum wire, when new, has a greater tensile strength than
steel. It becomes brittle and will break easily in the course of its
life as a filament. It is therefore advisable when lamps have served
for some time not to remove them from their old fittings and put
them into new ones, as that might easily cause the filament to break.
New lamps are not very sensitive to strong shocks, even while burn-
ing, but when this alteration in the filament has occurred it is well to
preserve them from shocks.

The behavior of the tantalum lamp under a very great increase of
voltage is of special interest to the incandescent-lamp maker. As
was to be expected, the trials
made in this respect have also — 20

globe can also be proved in a few hours by means of comparative
burning tests at about 30 per cent overload.

Another advantage of the tantalum lamp over the carbon lamp is
that the resistance of tantalum, like that of all other metals, strongly
increases with the rise of temperature, while carbon is known to
diminish in resistance when it is hot. In figure 9 the variation of
the resistance of tantalum and of carbon as a function of the voltage
is graphically represented, the pressure being assumed as 100 volts
and the resistance at 100 arbitrary units when the efficiency is 1°5
watts per Hefner candlepower, so that for each per cent of variation
of voltage the respective percentage of variation of resistance 1s
shown. It will be seen in the first instance that the resistance of the
tantalum increases to more than five times its original value from the
cold state to 1-5 watts per Hefner candlepower, while the resistance
of the carbon decreases to about one-half of its initial value. It will
140 THE TANTALUM LAMP.

further be noticed that even afterwards the resistance of tantalum
goes on rising, while the resistance of carbon keeps dropping.
Therefore the increase or decrease of pressure causes the strength of
current, and with it the illuminating value, to rise or fall at a quicker
rate in the carbon lamp than in the tantalum lamp, and, consequently,
the latter is less sensitive to variations of pressure than the former.

Having thus related the whole history of the development of the
tantalum lamp and fully entered into a critical comparison between
it and the carbon filament lamp, we need scarcely add that we do
not intend, of course, to be satisfied with what we have already
obtained. For the time being, however, and until a larger building
has been erected for the production of tantalum, our firm has resolved
to keep to the type for which there is an immediate practical demand.
That is the lamp for 100 to 120 volts; which supphes 25 Hefner
candlepower at 110 volts, or will have a higher or lower illuminat-
ing value if worked at correspondingly higher or lower voltages. In
conclusion, I would recapitulate the properties which we claim as
peculiar characteristics of our invention as follows:

1. The tantalum lamp has a filament made of a metallic conduc-
tor,-and burns at once on being connected without any previous
heating.

2. The light-giving wire is prepared by melting in a vacuum and
drawing. It is tough even in the cold state, and can therefore be
coiled and fixed in the lamp when cold.

3. A relatively great length of wire can be placed in a simple man-
ner within a bulb of ordinary dimensions.

4. Tantalum ore exists in considerable quantities and can be easily
procured.

5. Similar principles of treatment can be adhibited to other metals
of a very high melting point.
SOME REFINEMENTS OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

By AMRBOSE SWASkEy, Cleveland, Ohio.

As we open this, the twenty-fifth annual meeting of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, the history of the society for a
quarter of a century comes before us, and it is an occasion when it is
especially appropriate to make some mention of the growth and
progress of the society since it was organized.

At the beginning of the society who would have dared to predict
the wonderful advance that has been made in mechanical engineering.
There was indeed a great field for work for just such a society. The
long list of meetings which have been so fully attended and so valu-
able to the members; the transactions, with their records of addresses,
papers, and discussions by men of experience in nearly every branch
of mechanical engineering, and the constant growth of the society
until at the present time it has a membership of nearly 2,900, all go
‘to show that from the beginning it has been an earnest and pro-
gressive organization, and a most important factor in the progress
of mechanical science and of the mechanic arts.

Not only those of us who were counted among its first members,
but those who from year to year have been added to its membership,
may well feel proud of its splendid record.

The scope and influence of the society, which has been constantly
increasing in the past, will surely continue, and never was its future
brighter than at present.

For the subject of my address I wish to speak of a few of those
methods and mechanisms which have been developed and perfected
to such a degree of refinement that they may be considered as almost
beyond the practical, and yet were it not for such refinements they
could not possibly be made to serve the utilitarian purposes which
make them of such inestimable value to us all.

The division and the measurement of time is to-day, as it has been
for ages, among the most important of the subjects affecting the wel-
fare of mankind, and as time has rolled on and there has been a better

understanding of the laws governing the universe, nearer and nearer
has been the approach to perfection in the working out of these dif-
ficult problems, but the many hmitations surrounding them have
always kept their full solution somewhere in the future.

The diurnal revolution of the earth, which gives the solar day, and
the revolution of the earth around the sun, the solar year, are the
arbitrary divisions of time marked off with the utmost precision
by the celestial bodies; and while the length of the solar day has,
from before the Christian era, been fairly well defined, the length of
the solar year was but approximately known until within a few hun-
dred years.

The length of the year as counted by the Julian calendar was too
long by eleven minutes and fourteen seconds, and this error amounted
to ten full days in the sixteen hundred years from the time the
Julian Calendar went into effect until the introduction of the Gre-
gorian calendar.

A few years ago, when visiting the Vatican Observatory, I was
particularly interested in the Gregorian tower, which forms a part of
the Vatican Library Building. After passing through a number of
rooms which are used in connection with the observatory, when near
the top of the tower, I was taken into the spacious and beautiful
‘alendar room, the walls of which are covered with paintings of the
highest order, executed centuries ago, under the direction of Pope
Gregory XIII. In the center of the room and forming a part of the
floor there was a large marble slab, on which was cut a fine line
exactly in the true meridian, and upon the line was a special mark
which indicated the altitude of the sun at noon of a certain day.
On the south wall, near the top of the room, there was a small aper-
ture through which the direct rays of the sun passed at noon, project-
ing a bright spot on the meridian line.

All of this had been planned and executed by the astronomers in
order that they might demonstrate the necessity of reforming the
calendar, and when at noon on the 11th of March, 1582, Pope Greg-
ery saw that the altitude of the sun as shown by the beam of light
was not for that particular day, but for the day ten days later, he
directed that ten days be stricken from the calendar, and that day
should be the 21st of March instead of the 11th.

With such precision had the astronomers determined the true
iength of the year that our present calendar, with its intercalations,
will continue on for twenty thousand years with an error not to ex-
ceed a single day.

The line on the marble slab and the aperture through the wall of
the calendar room were devices simple in the extreme, and in this day
of instruments such a method would hardly be considered, yet they
served their purposes admirably, and the placing of that line on the

true meridian, with an accuracy never before attained, was consid-
ered one of the greatest scientific achievements of that age.

Since an unknown time the day has been divided into twenty-four
hours, and as civilization has advanced the greater has been the ne-
cessity for the utmost precision in the measurement of each hour with
its subdivisions.

The sun dial is not only the earliest, but the most interesting of all
the numerous arrangements that have been devised for measuring
the divisions of the day. Notwithstanding its limitations, it has
been a subject which has attracted the brightest minds for ages.
Within these later years there has been a renewed interest in this an-
cient timekeeper, not only in copying the types of dials, which are
valuable because of their antiquity, but in working out new forms.
Recently a new dial has been invented by which the rays of the sun
will indicate the true mean time for each day of the year with an
error not to exceed one minute.

The hour glass, which came later, was considered a much more
practical method, inasmuch as it could be used either day or night,
and because its use was not confined to a particular location; how-
ever, as a timekeeper it was not satisfactory, even in those early
days.

The clepsydra, or water clock, which is supposed to have been in-
vented by the Greeks, was found to be a much better timekeeper than
either the sun dial 6r hour glass, and it was a great step in advance
toward the accurate measurement of time.

These water clocks are to this day used extensively in the East,
more especially in China. Those first used by the Greeks consisted
of two water jars so arranged that the water from the upper ran into
the lower, and the time of day was determined by measuring the
depth of water in the upper jar, and at sunrise each day the water
was returned to the upper jar. In the city of Canton there is a water
clock which has been running for eight hundred years, and at the
present time it is the standard clock of that city. This clock consists
of four water jars, each having a capacity of 8 or 10 gallons. The
jars are placed one above the other in the form of a terrace, the
three upper ones being provided with a small orifice near the bottom
through which the water drops into the jar next below, and so on
down from one to the other until the water reaches the lowest or
registering jar. In this there is a float, to which is attached an up-
right, having graduations for the hours and parts of hours, and as
the water rises the time can be determined by noting the height of
the float in relation to the crossbar at the top of the jar.

In this improved form of water clock the variation in the flow of
water due to the difference in height is overcome by having a series
of jars, the outlet of the upper being so graduated that there is but
144 SOME REFINEMENTS OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

little variation in the height of water in the second jar, and in the
third the height remains practically uniform, thus insuring a con-
stant head for the water which drops into the registering jar. At
the beginning of each day the water is taken from below and carried
up a flight of steps to the top.

That such an arrangement has some elements favorable to the ac-
curate measurement of time there can be no doubt. It certainly has
the element of simplicity, and notwithstanding its long service, the
only wear noticeable was confined to the steps leading to the up-
per jar.

Clocks of the present type, although used as far back as the twelfth
century, and possibly earher, were but fair timekeepers until several
centuries later. Those which the astronomers used in their observa-
tories at the end of the fifteenth century were so unreliable that mod-
ified forms of the clepsydras of the ancients were used, and as they
did not prove to be satisfactory, most of the observations were made
without the use of clocks.

Galileo’s beautiful discovery of the isoghronism of the pendulum
from the swinging chandelier in the cathedral at Pisa was of great
value in many respects, but in none more so than in its application
to the measurement of time.

Soon after that great discovery the English clock maker, Graham,
invented the mercurial pendulum, by which the variation in its
length caused by the difference in temperature was fully compensated,
and some years later Harrison, another English clock maker, invented
a compensating pendulum, which consisted of a series of metal bars
having different coefficients of expansion—so that two hundred years
ago, as it is to-day, the pendulum was the nearest perfect of all the’
devices that have been employed for governing or controlling the
motions of a clock mechanism.

Every part of the clock down to the minutest detail has been the
subject of study and improvement, and clocks are made and adjusted
with such precision and delicacy that in testing them the question is
within how small a fraction of a second will they run. Not content
with their marvelous performance when under normal conditions,
some of the finest astronomical clocks are surrounded by glass or
metal cases, in which a partial vacuum is maintained, and in order
that the cases may not be opened or disturbed the winding is done
automatically by means of electricity, the frequency of the winding
in some cases being as often as once every minute. These clocks are
set up in especially constructed rooms or underground vaults, where
they are free from jar or vibration, where the temperature and
barometric conditions remain practically constant, and where every
possible precaution is taken to further minimize the errors of the
running rate.
SOME REFINEMENTS OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE. 145

A clock in the observatory at Berlin has run for several months
under these favorable conditions with a rate having a mean error
of but fifteen one-thousandths of a second per day and a maximum
error of thirty one-thousandths of a second per day.

Another clock, installed at the observatory of Case School of Ap-
plied Science, at Cleveland, running under similar conditions, also
has a mean error of fifteen one-thousandths of a second per day, with
a maximum error for several months of but twenty-two one-thou-
sandths of a second per day.

These are notable examples of the present state of the art of clock
making and show the wonderful precision with which minute inter-
vals of time can be measured.

From the time of the invention of Peter Hele, in 1477, of the
“Nuremburg animated egg,” or “ pocket clock,’ which required
winding twice a day and varied an hour and a half in the same length
of time, the development of the watch has kept pace with the
“mother clock ” and followed closely to it in time-keeping qualities.

These marvelous little machines, whether made at the homes of the
peasants among the hills and mountains of Switzerland, where the
skill required for making a single part has been handed down from
generation to generation, or made in the great factories of this coun-
try, where fully 2,000,000 high-grade movements are turned out
annually and where the skill of the workmen has been supplemented
by modern methods and machinery, are, notwithstanding the difficul-
ties attending their manufacture, produced so cheaply as to be within
the reach of almost everyone.

The larger watch, or ship chronometer, with its escapement so
delicately made and adjusted that it must always be kept in the
same position, was greatly improved through the efforts of the Brit-
ish Government in 1714 by offering rewards of ten, fifteen, and twenty
thousand pounds to any who should make chronometers that would
run so accurately that the longitude of a ship at sea could be deter-
mined within 60, 40, and 30 miles. Harrison, the inventor of the
compensating pendulum and the compensating balance, which is now
used in watches, succeeded in making a chronometer which, after
being tested on a long voyage, was found to run so closely that the
position of the ship was determined within 18 miles, and he was
therefore paid the full award of £20,000. That historic chronometer,
which marked a new era in navigation, is now numbered among the
treasures of the Greenwich Observatory.

Modern ships are equipped with chronometers so accurate and so
reliable and with sextants of such precision that navigators can
determine their position in latitude and longitude within a few miles.
Therefore, with the increased speed of the powerful ships, carrying
hundreds or even thousands of passengers, together with their val-
146 SOME REFINEMENTS OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

uable cargoes, the methods and instruments used in navigation have
been so improved as to greatly diminish the dangers in crossing the
seas.

The perfection attained in the measurement of time, which is of
such great practical value in nearly every sphere of life, would not
have been possible were it not for the even greater refinements that
have characterized the methods and instruments used by the astrono-
mer in determining the length of the day and of the year, which are
the fundamental standards of time.

The division of the circle and the measurement of angles have
ever been among the unsolved problems of the astronomer, yet in the
instruments used by him circles have formed a most important part.

Long before the telescope was invented, Tycho Brahe, the Danish
astronomer, “ the founder of modern astronomy,” constructed for his
observatory instruments of various kinds having graduated circles
and ares of circles. His instruments for the most part were improve-
ments on those used by Arabian astronomers in the eighth and ninth
centuries, and these in turn were copied after similar instruments used
by the Greeks and Egyptians a thousand years previous, and it is sup-
posed that such instruments were used by the Chinese at an even
earlier period, so that graduated circles have come down to us from
the far-off ages.

The longer the radius the more accurate the graduations, was the
principle upon which the early instruments were made. The Ara-
bians in about the year 1000 built a sextant with a 60-foot radius
and a quadrant with a 21-foot radius, but to Tycho Brahe is due the
credit of constructing instruments having circles much smaller in
diameter and graduated with a greater precision than ever before.
It was by the use of such improved instruments of his own making,
and by his observations which were made without a telescope or any
means of magnification, that he was able to give the positions of a
large number of stars within less than one minute of are from the
positions given by modern astronomers.

The graduation of an 8-foot mural circle in 1725 by Graham, of
England, for the National Observatory, and of an 8-foot quadrant
by Bird, in 1767, were notable steps in advance in the division of the
circle and the measurement of angles; but these and similar instru-
ments, although their efficiency was greatly augumented by the use of
the telescope, have been supplanted by others more practical.

The first circular dividing engine was made in 1740 by Henry Hind-
ley, of York, England, for cutting the teeth of clock wheels, and it is
interesting to note that in the same year Huntsmann, another clock-
maker, of Sheffield, invented the process of making crucible steel,
that he might have a metal suitable for the springs of his clocks.
SOME REFINEMENTS OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE. TAG

Of the several engines constructed later the one most successful
and representing the greatest progress was that made by Ramsden
in 1777. This engine, automatic in its movements, was made espe-
cially for graduating circles, and because of the great precision with
which he divided the circles of the instruments used by the Govern-
ment the board of longitude awarded him the sum of £615. <A fur-
ther and most potent recognition of the excellence of his work lies in
the fact that all subsequent circular dividing engines have followed
closely the same general principles of construction embodied in the.
Ramsden engine.

It is most gratifying to all those who are interested in mechanical
progress that the Ramsden engine has been preserved throughout all
these years and now stands in the Museum of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution at Washington as a monument to the one who made it and as
the best example of that time of the art of graduating circles.

Many excellent dividing engines have been made that are quite
sufficient in point of accuracy for the work for -which they were
intended, but the perfection required in the graduation of circles for
astronomical instruments is such that it has been found to be one of
the most difficult of all mechanical problems to make an engine that
will meet such requirements.

In such an engine the chief essential is that the spindle carrying
the master plate shall be as nearly round and as closely fitted in its
bearings as is possible, for the degree of excellence with which that
work is done determines how closely a cirele can be divided.

It seems almost incredible that a well-lubricated spindle of 4
inches in diameter at its largest part and tapering three-quarters of .
an inch to the foot can be made so nearly round and so closely fitted
in its bearings that a movement of one-thousandth of an inch in or
out of its bearings will in one case cause it to turn with difficulty
and in the other with perfect freedom; yet this has been found to be
within the limits of mechanical refinements.

The greatest accuracy thus far attained in such engines is one
second of are, which are, with a radius of 3 miles, equals 1 inch, and
at 20 inches, which is the radius of the silver ring upon which the
graduations on the master plate are made, a line one-thousandth of
an inch in width is equal to twelve seconds of arc, or twelve times the
accumulated errors of any number of divisions, or twenty times the
greatest error of any single division.

In automatically graduating a circle, it has been found to be
impracticable to cut more than six lines in a minute, and it requires
about thirty-three hours to divide a circle into two-minute spaces.
As with the running of the finest clocks, so only can the best results
be obtained when the engine is surrounded with every favorable
148 SOME REFINEMENTS OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

condition possible. Instead of the large circles and sectors used by
the ancients, circles of smaller diameter have been made as the
methods for graduating have been improved, until those of the more
modern instruments are seldom greater than 30 inches, and some of
the latest meridian instruments have circles of but 25 inches.

The smaller circles, which can be made and graduated with greater
precision than the larger ones, are also less lable to change in form,
owing to their weight and the variation in temperature, and with the
aid of the reading microscope the results obtained would not be
possible with the larger circles.

A 25-inch circle read with a microscope having a power of 40
would be equivalent to a circle of about 80 feet in diameter, and
a single second of arc as seen through the microscope would be equal
to 0.0024 of an inch, a quantity easily subdivided.

A most important adjunct to the astronomer’s instrumental equip-
ment is the filar micrometer. With it he determines the errors of
divisions, the eccentricity of his circle, and measures the angles to
within a fraction of a second; and when used at the eye end of the
telescope he determines the positions and motions of the stars and
the distances and diameters of the planets. In these little instru-
ments, whether of the simple or complex form, the chief requisites
are the screw and the cross wires, for upon them the value of the
observations and measurements depend.

To make the screw of a micrometer so true that the errors in the
threads can not be detected by-its own magnifying power is an
extremely difficult task. These micrometer screws are often made
with 100 threads to the inch, and are provided with graduated drums
having 100 divisions, the readings being made in tenths of a division.

The cross wires, which are but common spider lines, because of
their fineness and the remarkable qualities they possess, are indispens-
able in micrometric work.

That the repulsive and even dangerous spider has plenty of ene-
mies among the human family there can be no doubt, yet if the value
of the contributions which it has made to the cause of science was
generally known, it would surely have a greater number of friends
than at present, and most certainly the astronomer will say naught
against it, for after the experience of many years he has found that
the spider furnishes the only. thread which can be successfully used
in carrying on his work.

The spider lines mostly used are from one-fifth to one-seventh of a
thousandth of an inch in diameter, and in addition to their strength
and elasticity, they have the peculiar property of withstanding
great changes of temperature, and often when measuring the sun
spots, although the heat is so intense as to crack the lenses of the
micrometer eyepiece, yet the spider lines are not in the least injured.
SOME REFINEMENTS OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE. 149

The threads of the silkworm, although of great value as a com-
mercial product, are so coarse and rough compared with the silk of
the spider that they can not be used in such instruments.

Platinum wires are made sufficiently fine, and make most excellent
cross wires for instruments where low magnifying powers are used,
yet as the power increases they become rough and imperfect.

Spider lines, although of but a fraction of a thousandth of an
inch in diameter, are made up of several thousands of microscopic
streams of fluid, which unite and form a single line, and it is because
of this that they remain true and round under the highest magnify-
ing power.

An instance of the durability of the spider lines is found at the
Allegheny Observatory, where the same set of lines in the micrometer
of the transit instrument has been in use since 1859.

The placing of the spider lines in the micrometer is a work of great
delicacy, and in some micrometers there are as many as thirty, which
form a reticule, with lnes two one-thousandths of an inch apart
and parallel with each other under the highest magnifying power.

Step by step, from the methods of the Arabian astronomers to
the time of Tycho Brahe and on down to the present day, improve-
ments in the instruments and methods for the measurement of angles
have been going on, until astronomers can measure double stars with
a separation of one second of arc, and within less than one second
they can define their positions in the heavens.

In the realm of the measurements of minute linear distances and
the perfection of curved and flat surfaces the refinements are even
greater than those pertaining to the measurement of time and of
angles.

Most important in the linear dividing engine is the screw, and
although much had been accomplished in bringing such engines to a
high degree of excellence, it was for Professor Rowland to make an
engine which has a practically perfect screw; and without doubt it
is in all respects the nearest perfect of all the mechanisms that have
been employed for ruling lines exactly parallel and equally spaced.

The Rowland engine was made especially for ruling diffraction
gratings which are made of speculum metal, and with it a metal sur-
face has been ruled with 160,000 lines, there being about 29,000 to the
inch, and as many as 43,000 lines to the inch have been ruled.

The gratings mostly used have from 14,000 to 20,000 lines to the
inch, and with such exactness is the cutting tool moved by the screw
that the greatest error in the ruling does not exceed one-millionth of
an inch.

The production of these gratings, which has enabled the physicist
in his study of the spectrum to enter fields of research before un-
known, has not only called for the highest degree of perfection ever
attained in the spacing of linear distances, but it has also called for
150 SOME REFINEMENTS OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

a refinement most difficult in the optical surfaces upon which the
lines are ruled. To Mr. Brashear was given the problem of produc-
ing such surfaces, and notwithstanding the many difficulties encoun-
tered in working and refining the speculum metal plates, he has
made many hundred plates with surfaces either flat or curved with
an error not to exceed one-tenth of a wave length of light, or one
four-hundred-thousandth of an inch.

As the established standards of length, which are the yard of
Great Britain and the meter of France, are made of metal and liable
tc destruction or damage, Professor Michelson conceived the idea of
determining the lengths of these standards in wave lengths of light,
which would be a basis of value unalterable and indestructible.

For the purpose of carrying out these experiments the Interfe-
rometer was constructed—an instrument which required the highest
order of workmanship and the greatest skill of the optician. Again
Mr. Brashear proved equal to the occasion, and made for the in-
strument a series of refracting plates, the surfaces of which were flat
within one-twentieth of a wave length of light, with sides parallel
within one second. This was the most difficult work ever attempted
in the refinement of optical surfaces.

Professors Michelson and Morley devised a method for using the
Interferometer to make the wave length of some definite light an
actual and practical standard of length. So satisfactory was the re-
sult that Professor Michelson was invited to continue the experi-
ments at the bureau of weights and measures at Sévres, France,
where the standard meter, which is kept in an underground vault
and inspected only at long intervals, was used for that important
work. The final result of the experiments, which occupied nearly a
year, shows that there are 1,553,164.5 wave lengths of red cadmium
light in the French standard meter at 15° C. So great is. the ac-
curacy of these experiments that they can be repeated within one
part in two millions. Should the material standard of length be dam-
aged or destroyed the standard wave length of light will remain
unaltered as a basis from which an exact duplicate of the original
standard can be made. These two marvelous instruments, the Row-
land dividing engine and the Michelson Interferometer, show the
possibilities in the perfection of linear divisions and the standards of
Jength.

We have recounted some steps of the progress that has been made
in the measurement of time, of angles, and of length, together with
some of the refinements in these measurements, but we are confronted
with the fact that notwithstanding all that has been accomplished
from centuries past down to the present time there are, as ever be-
fore, many imperfections requiring new problems in mechanical
science to be worked out for the further enlightenment and welfare
of mankind.

PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY.¢

By L. GASTINE.

°
The X rays were discovered during the closing months of the yea
1895, so that but a brief time has been available for the study of

their use, though these few years have been fruitful ones.

We must recognize at the start that the subject has been greatly
favored by its element of the marvelous, which appeals so keenly to
the public at large. Scientific men know well that prior work of
numerous physicists had already prepared the way for Roentgen’s
half-accidental discovery, but these advances had been cheerfully
ignored by the masses, and even by most physicians and surgeons
throughout the world.

Very naturally, then, when it became positively known that with
the X rays the skeleton of the hand could be photographed there
was excitement everywhere, for it will be recalled that the bones of
the hand were the first invisible solid bodies reproduced by Roentgen.
The image thus obtained demonstrated an important fact, the per-
meability of opaque bodies by the new rays, and on account of the
uncertainty as to their character they were christened * X rays.”

With this new process objects were photographed incased in wood
(as a compass In its box), money in a purse, the wheels of a watch
through its case, and what not; and these amazing experiments
served incidentally to demonstrate that the permeability of solid
bodies varies with the character of the substance. It was learned,
for instance, that wood, plaster, cloth, paper, are easily traversed by
these rays, while metals are less penetrable, especially glass and lead.

While investigators were establishing empirically by rather trifling
experiments the comparative permeability. of different ‘substances,
the medical world was amusing itself making attempts to radiograph
various parts of the human skeleton. In every civilized country
experiments showed the power of the rays to penetrate the hands,
the feet, the arms, the legs; and decided it was hardly possible to go
further; the head forming a recalcitrant mass, the torso and abdomen

152 PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY.

giving only uninteresting and indistinct images. This together with
the fact that only imperfect silhouettes at best could be obtained,
calmed somewhat the zeal of a majority of curious practitioners.
Most of those who for a moment had anticipated finding in the new
discovery a valuable method of research were disappointed, and con-
demned it utterly.

The excess of curiosity and anticipation naturally resulted in a
reaction, which was accentuated by the organization of enterprises
for public exhibition, where for a few cents or even for nothing, any-
one was shown whatever part of his body he wished to see, or he was
given a picture of such part of his skeleton as could be easily radio-
graphed.

Although this commercial exploitation did little for the good name
of radiography, and in some cases resulted in personal injury by
burning the patient, yet it served at least to advertise it widely. Hap-
pily, however, while this popularization of Roentgen’s discovery was
going on, truly scientific research occupied the attention of many
serious and competent persons. Students took up the application of
radiography to anatomy, then to medicine and surgery, and to some
of them it seemed to be a simple operation. Apparently all that was
necessary was an electric current, a Ruhmkorff coil, a Crookes tube,
and some ordinary photographic plates with the simple chemicals
for developing them. Such was the reasoning with the advent of
radiography. It has not yet greatly improved, though, despite mis-
apprehensions and misuses, radiography has continued its progress.
Physicists like Villars perfected the Crookes tube; technicians like
Contremoulins devised exact instruments for their practical applica-
tion. Indistinct images were superseded by radiographs of admira-
ble clearness in which the most delicate details of the bone structure
were exactly reproduced.

The radiograph was in time applied to the skeletons of mice, fish,
snakes, frogs, to small mummies, fossils, and shells. Finally a sue-
cessful attempt was made to penetrate the more bulky parts of the
human body. As early as 1896 investigators had obtained silhouettes
not only of the bones but also of the more or less penetrable parts of
the organism, like the heart and the lungs. These successes encour-
aged more vigorous attacks on other portions, and with special meth-
ods they finally overcame obstacles and rendered possible radiographs
of parts of the skull, the muscles, and even of the arterial system in the
hand. It is only fair, however, to state that most of this progress
was made in the laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine, at Paris,
and the results were scarcely known by the majority of those busily
engaged in making radiographic researches by less scientific methods.
Anxious merely to get good pictures, and without accurate knowledge
of the physical, geometrical, and anatomical conditions which must

necessarily be taken into consideration, these operators groped their
way to an ability to make radiographs, more or less clear to be sure,
but often deplorable as indications of actual conditions, for the pic-
tures failed to show what ought to be shown, and sometimes even
showed what was not existent.

The experimenters could of course make nothing of these deceptive

errors, for in the medical world particularly, questions of pure

physics and geometry are by no means clearly understood. An emi-
nent member of the Academy of Medicine voiced, therefore, the senti-
ments of a great number of his confreres when he declared that the
radiograph was likely to err gravely and that its indications were of
little value. He even went so far as to say that no two radiographers
could take similar radiographs of the same fracture. That this last
statement is true in practice, although theoretically erroneous, has
been demonstrated experimentally before another learned assembly
by the production of radiographs of a fracture, taken at various
angles, in some of which the incidence was normal, in others oblique.
To understand the real fallacy of the case in question it is only neces-
sary to realize that since the radiograph is only a conic projection of
certain shadows these shadows will necessarily vary according to the
angle at which they are projected, a fact which makes all radio-
graphic deformations and exaggerations easily appreciable. For in-
stance, when walking along the street in the evening your shadow
from some gashght grows longer and longer as you increase your dis-
tance from the lamp-post. About noon, shadows are short; as the sun
sinks toward the horizon the rays strike objects more obliquely and
the shadows are elongated. These elongations are due to the angle of
the rays of light; they illustrate exactly how two fragments of frac-
tured bone radiographed at too oblique an angle may unite to form
a single silhouette, the elongation of the shadows making a continu-
ous image, and thus hiding the fracture.

The distance between the fractured member and the photographic
plate, and between the member and the Crookes tube, also plays an
important part in the formation of the radiographic image. In
throwing “Chinese shadows” on the wall with the hands it is
quickly evident that the silhouette is very small when the hand is
close to the wall, and that it grows rapidly when the hand is moved
toward the light. The same principle is true in radiography. If,
as often happens, the ends of the fracture are far apart, the fragment
nearer the light gives an exaggerated shadow in the radiograph,
which joins the normal shadows of the more distant portion and
effectually conceals the break. Or if, as they more frequently do, the
two ends overlap, the radiograph will, of course, should the fracture
have been reproduced from a position beneath which the bones over-

sm 1905——14 ;
154 PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY.

lap, give an image without a break; but, on the other hand, should
the fracture be reproduced from a point at right angles from the first
position, the break in the bone will show plainly. In other words,
taken from in front, the fracture will be hidden, if the ends overlap
in that position, while it will appear clearly if the fracture is radio-
graphed from the side, because the broken ends will then be one be-
side the other.

These theoretical and experimental demonstrations determined
clearly the technique for this kind of radiography. It is: (1) To
take not one but two radiographs of every fracture or suspected frac-
ture, these radiographs to be taken at different points about 90 degrees
apart; (2) to place the fractured bone as close as practicable to the
photographie plate, and the Crookes tube perpendicularly above as
far as possible from the fracture and thus avoid distortion. This
is the method of procedure which obtains in all laboratories worthy
of the name, and radiographs taken in accordance with it give httle
basis for the statements of the belittlers of the process.

If the rays employed are not penetrating enough for the case in
hand, the imperfection of the image will be so great as to prevent the
suspected break being seen as it should, and if, on the contrary, the
‘ays be too penetrating, the sensitive plate will not produce a good
image. Too many interruptions in a given time for a given case
will destroy the shading of the image, and, reciprocally, the image will
be too feeble if the number of interruptions is insufficient. And each
case requires an appreciation of its peculiar factors of penetration
and quantity. I will not even mention the problems regarding the
sensitiveness of the emulsions for the plate, the thickness of the films,
the qualities and faults of the developers, fixers, printing papers, or
of the difficulties in developing and printing.

You have already surmised, no doubt, from the points we have just
touched upon that mere ability to get an image does not constitute a
radiographer. A perfect knowledge of the geometric laws governing
the formation of shadows is indispensable; not a theoretical knowl-
edge, but a practical acquaintance which will enable one to operate
rationally and to interpret logically the images obtained under care-
fully observed conditions. Moreover, the skillful practitioner must
have a perfect knowledge of the forms and exact proportions of the
bones or other parts to be observed, so as to be able to recognize and
appreciate the almost inevitable radiographic deformation, and to
distinguish it from real malformation in the parts themselves.

Besides this exact knowledge of geometry and anatomy, the radio-
grapher must be a clever electrician to understand the complex phy-
sical phenomena which govern the formation of X rays in the
Crookes tubes. A Crookes tube emits X rays of greater or less pene-
tration in proportion to its state of vacuum, and according to the
PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY. 155

number of interruptions per second in the current which forms the
electric discharges in the tube, the image is quickly or slowly formed
on the photographie plate.

To make a radiograph when one has the proper materials at hand
is a physical experiment which any college student can perform as
easily as he can bring about a simple chemical reaction. But as this
student would be utterly incapable of making a quantitative or quali-
tative chemical analysis, no more can he carry out a rational radio-
graphic research to determine even the simplest fracture. This com-
parison is not an idle one, for just as a man is not a full-fledged
chemist when he knows how to make a single kind of analysis, a man
is by no means a really competent radiographer because he can get a
good radiograph of a fracture of the arm or leg.

There are as many different methods of radiographing as there are
different cases to be treated, and the processes vary with the nature
of the subject. A broken bone in the hand is not approached in the
same way as 1s a fracture in the foot; the thigh is a good deal more
difficult to radiograph than the forearm; and a break in the neck of
the femur, for instance, is one particularly difficult to determine.
Certain simple fractures almost reproduce themselves—that is to say,
despite the incompetence of the operator—while others, where the
bone is net much displaced, are exceedingly elusive.

Radiography, however, does not concern itself entirely with broken
bones; it reveals innumerable other organic alterations. Before
taking up any of its principal applications in surgery and medicine,
let us glance for a moment at its utilization in locating foreign sub-
stances in the body.

The human body would seem to be in little danger of accidental
penetration by extraneous substances, but as a matter of fact these
penetrations are not uncommon, especially in the larger cities. In
Paris, for instance, hundreds of people have needles, pins, bullets,
grains of lead, pieces of money, or metallic splinters extracted from
their muscular tissues, intestines, stomach, cesophagus, eyes, and even
from the brain itself, which is, contrary to the general opinion, easily
explored by modern methods without fatal results.

All searches for foreign substances in these various parts of the
body require a most exact localization, for it is necessary to know
just where the object is before operating with scalpel and forceps.
To understand the complexity, let us imagine the patient is the victim
of a footpad, brought unconscious to the hospital. He has been shot
in the chest; the wound is plain enough. In the hope that the ball
has not penetrated far the surgeon probes, but finds nothing. The
bullet has gone deep; possibly it is near the heart or some other vital
organ. In such a case it would be dangerous to grope blindly with
the proble; and a radiograph localization becomes necessary.
156 PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY.

Or, in another instance, a victim of despair has turned his weapon
on his own heart. The probe moves cautiously, for its direction
seems to indicate that the attempt was successful. But no; the ball
has turned aside; the probe encounters some unbroken tissues not far
from the surface. Here again the radiograph is necessary.

The direction of entry of a projectile is too frequently but little
indication of its direction in the body. A ball aimed at the heart
may be found in the intestines or the lower back, or a bullet entering
the right temple is lodged on the left, after having rebounded into
the interior of the cranial cavity.

When an undesirable object has been swallowed, it is, of course, not
very difficult to foretell the road it will travel, but to know the posi-
tion of these capricious tourists at any given moment is difficult.
Many of them halt en route; and these are just the ones it is necessary
to look after. The radiograph must be called into service.

The treacherous needle, entire or broken, enters the muscular tis-
sues. You think it can not be far from the surface. It isa great mis-
take. Try if you will to extract it; the needle travels. Let us exam-
ine this strange game of hide and seek; whether broken or not the
needle has at one end a very sharp point and at the other a blunter
extremity which penetrates with more difficulty. If it be a broken
end, it will not penetrate at all save in the softest tissues. There-
fore each movement, each muscular contraction, drives the sharp
point deeper and deeper, and as its blunt end will permit no retreat
the needle advances, traveling ceaselessly in most unexpected direc-
tions. To remove it, a most exact localization is necessary, since
a needle is a small object to begin with, and when embedded in a
heavy muscle a surgeon has the utmost difficulty in discovering it
with ordinary instruments.

The extraction of any foreign body calls likewise for a most pre-
cise localization; only the exact knowledge of the whereabouts of such
a body will reduce the operative interference to a minimum.

The method of locating projectiles lodged in the skull, devised in
1897 by Monsieur Contremoulins, has solved with a marvellous
degree of precision the question of exact localization. The princi-
ples of this method are explained by the inventor in an article pub-
lished by the Revue Internationale d’Electrothérapie et de Radio-
graphie (pl. vit, fig. 1) :

Given a head containing a projectile “x,” we begin our determination of the
exact position of the bullet with reference to the skull. On any three points
of the face we apply the extremities of the three branches of a compass (a, 0b, €),
which are attached to a’, b’, ¢. On the right of the head is the photographic
plate E EB’; on the left the two Crookes tubes L ZL’, held constantly in the same
relation to the head and the plate.

Now, if we operate successively the two tubes we will have the shadow of
the projectile “x” on two different points on the plate # E’. (These points

Then if we can determine exactly the position of the two sources of light
on one hand, and, on the other, find the exact centers (1 I’) of the two shadows
on the plate, we can stretch two lines—say, of fine wire—from the center of the
lights to the center of the shadows; and these two lines will intersect at a point
im space which represents exactly the center of the projectile.

Suppose, now, that the two radiographs are completed. We can withdraw the
head of the subject without disturbing in the least the relations of the compass,
the Crookes tubes, and the photographic plate. Then we may stretch our two
wires from the tubes to the shadows and obtain with the most perfect exact-
ness the position of the center of the projectile with reference to the face of the
subject, or, what amounts to the same thing, with reference to the extremities
of the three branches of the compass, which represent the position of the face
in space while the radiographs were being taken.

Finally, if we attach to the body of the compass an adjustable needle which
will exactly indicate the intersection of the two wires (the center of the ball)
we will have all the elements necessary for finding the hidden missile.

Such is the theory. In practice it is, of course, necessary to have
a special apparatus adapted to all heads, which through its perfect
rigidity insures the maintenance of the relative positions of the
branches of the compass, the Crookes tubes, and the photographic
plate.

As this article is not a comprehensive treatise on radiography we
will not attempt to explain any of the essential operations—the
marking on the subject’s face of the points touched by the compass,
the exact determination of the center of light of the X rays in order to
place the wires, or the adjustment of the articulated fourth branch
of the compass with its needle end.

When all these operations are accomplished the compass, with its
three stationary branches and its needle indicator, will, as we have
said, show the exact position of the projectile. This instrument
might be used to guide the operation of extraction, but in practice
it is replaced by an almost exactly similar “ compass of extraction,”
which may be sterilized and therefore more safely guide the surgeon
in his work.

The patient is etherized, the operation compass is applied so that
its three branches correspond exactly with the three points marked
on his face. Then the needle indicator on the fourth arm shows to
the surgeon (a) in what direction he must cut to find the projectile,
(b) by the distance between the sliding adjustment and the needle
point how deep he must go to extract it. To simplify the operation,
the compass has two needles, one regulated by the other. This allows
the surgeon to choose the most suitable point for an incision. This
point decided, the scalp is cut away and the skull laid bare and
opened by trepanning.

As many times as he may need its guidance the surgeon can place
the sterilized compass on the subject’s head; and, finally, when the
158 PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY.

needle can glide to the extremity of its course its point touches the
projectile. The surgeon has then only to draw it out with his forceps.

So precise is this method and so accurate are the instruments that
fragments of grains of lead have been withdrawn from the brain.
The localizations it achieves are rigorously exact—to the half milli-
meter. Altogether it renders so practicable intracranial operations
formerly considered impossible that one of our most celebrated sur-
geons acknowledged it a guiding hght which renders easy and safe
the extraction of hidden projectiles.

By the same geometric method, somewhat simplified and with
modified apparatus, the exact location of foreign bodies lodged in
any part of the body may be discovered. Also, as will easily be seen,
since this method gives a precise indication of a single point, it will
do similar service for a series of poimts. <A projectile encounters a
bone and flies into fragments, a subject has been struck by several
bullets, a bone is shattered into splinters; in any of these cases the
rarious-parts are located with as much precision as is the single ball.

The number of exact localizations that the radiograph can make
is almost unlimited. In practical radiography this ability to take a
number of observations is very valuable, especially in the case of
malformation, for it permits an exact determination of the contour
of the bony matter and of faults of conformation.

Thus metroradiography permits of exact measurements of all
parts of the organism which give clear images under the X rays.
It bears the same relation to simple radiography that quantitative
chemical analysis does to qualitative; that is to say, in most cases in
medicine, as well as in surgery, a knowledge of the nature of the case
is as nothing compared with a knowledge of the importance of the
case.

Early in the article we noticed that in spite of the disfavor into
which radiography had fallen through misdirected activity, yet a
few serious physicists continued their work and obtaimed now and
then remarkable results, which have done much to redeem the good
name of radiography. A great part of the progress must be at-
tributed to two men, whose names should always be recognized—the
physicist Villars, and Chabaud, the perfecter of the Crookes tubes.
Among the radiographers themselves should be cited A. Londe, who,
during the early years, did worthy work in his photographic studies
at Salpétriére. His efforts were directed toward the better selection
and installation of radiographic material and then toward per-
fecting it and employing it with more method. To him we are in-
debted for the first practical treatise, which although superseded and
discredited in part, was of much interest in its day. Unfortunately,
however, after a few years of radiography, Monsieur Londe gave up
his operations at the Salpétriére.

PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY. 159

From the very discovery of the X rays, Monsieur Contremoulins,
at that time preparator to the Faculty of Medicine, has by the em-
ployment of reasonable and scientific methods attained the best results,
which have been described in his numerous communications to the
academies. He was the first to obtain clear images of the cranium,
the thorax, and the pelvis. While studying with the late Dr. V. Le-
moine on the possible applications of radiography to zoology and
paleontology, he made marvelous images of bony structures and radio-
graphs of fossils, which have never been surpassed. Applying the
X rays to anatomical study, he obtained by injections of metal into
the vessels clear radiographs of the arteries and their ramifications in
the finger tips. Images of the muscles of the hand he got in a similar
manner. |

I do not wish to neglect in this article any of those who are work-
ing with radiography, and who, through their publications or their
communications to the learned societies, are accredited with having
created something good or interesting. If I fail to mention them, I
will appear partial, which I am not; if, on the other hand, I do
cite them by name, I must necessarily characterize with a word or
so the value, defects, or insignificance of their work.

Doctor Béclere has written and spoken much on the X rays,
especially on radioscopy, which must not be confounded with radi-
ography. In this connection let us look for a moment at the prin-
ciples of radioscopy. Under the action of X rays from a Crookes tube
a screen treated with platinocyanide of barium is completely ilumi-
nated. Now,if a hand is interposed between the Crookes tube and this
screen, the image of the hand will appear on the screen, not, however,
as a mere silhouette, but with the flesh, muscles, nerves, and veins,
and bones shadowed more or less deeply according to their resistance
to the rays. Thus may be seen on the screen the bones of the thorax,
and some of its organs, like the heart, whose movements may be
discerned without difficulty.

Such a method of investigation and analysis is naturally seductive.
Whether it is really as valuable as radiography is a many-sided ques-
tion and one which I hardly care to discuss here; so I content myself
for the present with a single statement. The radioscope in a limited
number of cases, such as the study of the movements of the thoracic.
organs, is of incomparable value and in a few other cases is comple-
mentary to the radiograph.

Doctor Guilleminot is the author of a really original and thorough
work on chronoradiography. The value of his method and its pro-
cesses is another question I am unwilling to attempt to settle; facts
are already beginning to indicate a lack of success, but time alone will
determine its legitimate place.
160 PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY.

Marie and Ribaut have given much study to a method of investiga-
tion and X ray analysis based upon stereoscopy. These experiments
are by no means lacking in interest, their radioscope-stereoscope
being particularly meritorious, though experience has demonstrated,
especially in the case of extracting projectiles, that human vision,
however perfect it may be, is a poor substitute for a mechanical
guide to the location of the foreign body.

Doctor Bouchacourt is the author of a method of investigation
with the X rays which he calls endodiascopic (e€vdov, from within;
dia, through; o@«Kozerv, to examine). He employs specially con-
structed Crookes tubes, which are introduced into the body through
the natural apertures. The tube projects a siihouette on a screen
(endodiascopy-radioscopy) or on a plate (endodiascopy-radiography )
of the parts of the organism coming between it and the screen or
the plate.

Marie and Cluzot, James Makenzie, Davidson and Hedley, Mergies,
Leduc, Massiot, Maunory, and others are also engaged in endeavors
to work out problems in various directions of research.

The science of the application of the properties of the X rays to
the analysis of the human body is an admirable and valuable devel-
opment, but one around which, unfortunately, harmful misapplica-
tions have clustered since its beginning.

In conclusion, the utilization of the X rays in medicine and sur-
gery since its inception with Roentgen’s discovery has developed
into a science essentially exact, precise, and certain—a science with
which you especially must sympathize because in its highest form
radiography has borrowed so much from photography. Moreover,
it is a science to interest us all, because it is constantly being called
upon to play a more or less important role in the relief of those ills
the flesh is heir to.

But learn how to discriminate between the good and the bad meth-
ods of applying the X rays; discover how to select the rational and
valuable processes of analysis; begin this by noting that simple radi-
ography and metroradiography are capable of meeting every ex-
igency.

The skeleton is perhaps the part of the human organism that may
best be studied with radiography and metroradiography. The radio-
graph pictures the bones of the infant as soon as they begin to form,
before birth even. Although these observations during gestation
may not be of any general interest, it is of great value to the parents
to know that their child has a well-formed skeleton. While the bones
of the infant are still soft a close watch on their development may
permit the prevention or reduction of malformations which might
be difficult to correct later. Parents anxious about their children’s

PROGRESS IN RADIOGRAPHY. 161

health should have them radiographed systematically when very
young and at various stages in their growth. These regular inspec-
tions will reveal, long before it becomes apparent otherwise, rickets,
leprosy, tuberculosis, or syphilis of the bones, Paget’s disease, osteoma-
lacia, bony tumors, dislocations, arthritis, gout, flat foot, rheumatism,
hip disease, spinal disease, and a score of other more or less common
troubles.

At all ages the human being is exposed to the introduction of
foreign substances into his body, either by natural entrances or
through penetration of the skin. The infant swallows pieces of
money or other small objects in his play; the adult accidentally swal-
lows a variety of tiny things, and besides is very much more likely
than is the infant to be struck by a projectile or to cut himself with
bits of metal or of glass. The radiograph, and in special cases the
radioscope, discovers these foreign bodies; metroradiography locates
them exactly and insures their easy and safe extraction.

Splinters of bone, detached bits of cartilage and tendon, growths
in the muscles, intestines, renal and other calculi may also be men-
tioned among foreign bodies that embarrass the human organism,
and which can be located through the agency of the X rays.

In heart troublés radiography and metroradiography furnish most
valuable indications. But in this case the radioscope, which allows
the observer to follow the movements of the organ, has an exceptional
and unequaled value. In examining the lungs, however, to discover
tuberculosis, phthisis, pulmonary sclerosis, and pleuritic affections
the radiograph alone gives delicate and certain indications. It
reveals pulmonary tuberculosis long before any symptoms are seen,
and often early enough to permit a cure.

The radiograph gives clear images of certain abscesses, and shows
exactly the extent and limits of any necessary operation. As to the
state of the teeth and maxillary bones of children and adults it fur-
nishes information of great importance, especially in cases of dental
anomalies, abscess, abnormal growth, the cause of certain neural-
gias, ete.

Finally, for several years past the X rays have been used in the
treatment of certain maladies such as lupus, acne, cancer, and even
of tuberculosis, and have generally seemed to have a helpful influ-
ence. But this last utilization, which naturally implies an exact
appreciation of the character of the rays, is a matter to which phy-
sicilans have not given enough care, since they have employed them
without sufficient data as to their curative power.

J. Toe PHorocrarnic Processes oN Paper or Sir Joun HeErscuet.

The researches of Sir John Herschel have been principally directed
to the investigation of the physical laws which regulate the chemical
changes we have been considering. His analyses of the prismatic
spectrum have been most complete, and as far as they have been car-
ried out go to prove the operation of forces other than those with
which we are acquainted.

At the same time, however, as this philosopher has been engaged
in investigations of this high order, he has from the multitude of his
experiments been successful in producing several processes of great
beauty. There are not any which are to be regarded as peculiarly
sensitive—they are, indeed, for the most part rather slow—but the
manipulation required is of the easiest character, and the results are
most curious and instructive.

The philosophy which is forever united with the scientific investi-
gations of Sir John Herschel is too valuable to be omitted from any
description of the processes which he recommends. The following
quotations are, therefore, taken from his communication to the Royal
Society, and linked together by my own remarks in such a manner as
it is hoped will be most easily understood by the unscientific amateur.

CYANOTYPE.

The processes in which cyanogen is employed are so called. Sir
John Herschel makes the following remarks on the subject of his ex-
periments with the cyanides:

I shall conclude this part of my subject by remarking on the great number
and variety of substances which, now that attention is drawn to the subject,
appear to be photographically impressible. It is no longer an insulated and
imomalous affection of certain salts of silver or gold, but one which doubtless, in

163
164 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

a greater or less degree, pervades all nature and connects itself intimately with
the mechanism by which chemical combination and decomposition is operated.
The general instability of organic combinations might lead us to expect the
occurrence of numerous and remarkable cases of this affection among bodies
of that class, but among metallic and other elements inorganically arranged
instances enough have already appeared and more are daily presenting them-
selves to justify its extension to all cases in which chemical elements may be
supposed combined with a certain degree of laxity and, so to speak, in a
tottering equilibrium. There can be no doubt that the process in a great
majority, if not in all, cases which have been noticed among inorganic sub-
stances is a deoxidizing one so far as the more refrangible rays are concerned.
It is obviously so in the cases of gold and silver. In that of the bichromate of
potash it is most probable that an atom of oxygen is parted with, and so of
many others. <A beautiful example of such deoxidizing action on a nonargen-
tine compound has lately occurred to me in the examination of that interesting
salt, the ferrosesquicyanuret of potassium, described by Mr. Smee in the Philo-
sophical Magazine, No. 109, September, 1840, and which he has shown how to
manufacture in abundance and purity by voltaic action on the common or
yellow ferrocyanuret. In this process nascent oxygen is absorbed, hydrogen
given off, and the characters of the resulting compound in respect of the oxides
of iron forming, as it does, Prussian blue with protosalts of that metal, but pro-
ducing no precipitate with its persalts, indicate an excess of electro-negative
energy, a disposition to part with oxygen, or, which is the same thing, to absorb
hydrogen (in the presence of moisture) and thereby to return to its pristine
state under circumstances of moderate solicitation, such as the affinity of pro-
toxide of iron, for instance, for an additional dose of oxygen, ete.

-aper simply washed with a solution of this salt is highly sensitive to the
action of light. Prussian blue is deposited (the base being necessarily supplied
by the destruction of one portion of the acid and the acid by decomposition of
another). After half an hour or an hour’s exposure to sunshine a very beauti-
ful negative photograph is the result, to fix which all that is necessary is to
soak it in water in which a little sulphate of soda is dissolved to insure the
fixity of the Prussian blue deposited. While dry the impression is dove color
or lavender blue, which has a curious and striking effect on the greenish-yellow
ground of the paper, produced by the saline solution. After washing the
ground color disappears and the photograph becomes bright blue on a white
ground. If too long exposed it gets “over sunned ” and the tint has a brownish
or yellowish tendency, which, however, is removed in fixing, but no increase
of intensity beyond a certain point is obtained by continuance of exposure.

If paper be washed with a solution of ammonio-citrate of iron and dried, and
then a wash passed over it of the yellow ferrocyanuret of potassium, there is
no immediate formation of true Prussian blue, but the paper rapidly acquires
a violet-purple color, which deepens after a few minutes, as it dries, to almost
absolute blackness. In this state it is a positive photographic paper of high
sensibility and gives pictures of great depth and sharpness, but with this pe-
culiarity, that they darken again spontaneously on exposure to the air in dark-
ness and are soon obliterated. The paper, however, remains susceptible to
light and capable of receiving other pictures, which in their turn fade, without
any possibility (so far as I can see) of arresting them, which is to be regretted,
as they are very beautiful and the paper of such easy preparation. If washed
with ammonia or its carbonate, they are for a few moments entirely obliter-
ated, but presently reappear with reversed lights and shades. In this state
they are fixed, and the ammonia, with all that it will dissolve, being removed
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 165

by washing in water, their color becomes a pure Prussian blue, which deepens
much by keeping. If the solution be mixed, there results a very dark violet-
colored ink, which may be kept uninjured in an opaque bottle, and will readily
furnish by a single wash at a moment’s notice the positive paper in question,
which is most sensitive when wet.

It seems at first sight natural to refer these curious and complex changes to
the instability of the cyanic compounds, and that this opinion is to a certain
extent correct is proved by the photographic impressions obtained on papers
to which no iron has been added beyond what exists in the ferrocyanic salts
themselves. Nevertheless, the following experiments abundantly prove that in
several of the changes above described the immediate action of the solar rays
is not exerted on these salts, but on the iron contained in the ferruginous solu-
tion added to them, which it deoxidizes or otherwise alters, thereby presenting
it to the ferrocyanic salts in such a form as to precipitate the acids in combi-
nation with the peroxide or protoxide of iron, as the case may be. To make
this evident, all that is necessary is simply to leave out the ferrocyanate in the
preparation of the paper, which thus becomes reduced to a simple washing
over with the ammonia-citric solution. Paper so washed is of a bright yellow
color and is apparently little, but in reality highly, sensitive to photographic
action. Exposed to strong sunshine, for some time indeed, its bright yellow
tint is dulled into an ochery hue or even to gray, but the change altogether
amounts to a moderate percentage of the total light reflected and in short
exposures is such as would easily escape notice. Nevertheless, if a slip of this
paper be held for only four or five seconds in the sun (the effect of which is
quite imperceptible to the eye, and, when withdrawn into the shade, be washed
over with the ferrosesquicyanate of potash, a considerable deposit of Prussian
blue takes place on the part sunned and none whatever on the rest, so that on
washing the whole with water a pretty strong blue impression is left, demon-
strating the reduction of iron in that portion of the paper to the state of
protoxide. The effect in question is not, it should be observed, peculiar to the
ammonio-citrate of iron. The ammonio and potassia-tartrate fully possess and
the perchloride, exactly neutralized, partakes of the same property, but the
experiment is far more neatly made and succeeds better with the other salts.

In further development of these most interesting processes Sir
John Herschel says:

The varieties of cyanotype processes seem to be innumerable, but that which
I shall now describe deserves particular notice, not only for its preeminent
beauty while in progress, but as illustrating the peculiar power of the
smmoniacal and other persalts of iron above mentioned to receive a latent
picture, susceptible of development by a great variety of stimuli. This process
consists in simply passing over the ammonia-citrated paper on which such a
latent picture has been impressed, very sparingly and evenly, a wash of the
solution of the common yellow ferrocyanate (prussiate) of potash. The latent
picture, if not so faint as to be quite invisible (and for this purpose should not
be so), is negative. As soon as the liquid is applied, which can not be in too
thin a film, the negative picture vanishes, and by very slow degrees is replaced
by a positive one of a violet-blue color on a greenish-yellow ground, which at
a certain moment possesses a high degree of sharpness an@ singular beauty and
delicacy of tint. If at this instant it be thrown into water, it passes imme-
diately to Prussian blue, losing at the same time, however, much of its sharp-
ness, and sometimes, indeed, becoming quite blotty and confused. But if this
be delayed, the picture, after attaining a certain maximum of distinctness,
166 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

grows rapidly confused, especially if the quantity of liquid applied be more
than the paper can easily and completely absorb, or if the brush in applying it
be allowed to rest on or to be passed twice over any part. The effect then
becomes that of a coarse and ill-printed wood cut, all the strong shades being
run together, and a total absence prevailing of half lights.

To prevent this confusion, gum arabic may be added to the prussiated solu-
tion, by which it is hindered from spreading unmanageably within the pores of
the paper, and the precipitated Prussian blue allowed time to agglomerate and
fix itself on the fibers. By the use of this ingredient also a much thinner and
more equable film may be spread over the surface; and when perfectly dry, if
not sufficiently developed, the application may be repeated. By operating thus
I have occasionally (though rarely) succeeded in producing pictures of great
beauty and richness of effect, which they retain (if not thrown into water)
between the leaves of a portfolio, and have even a certain degree of fixity—
fading in a strong light, and recovering their tone in the dark. The manipula-
tions of this process are, however, delicate, and complete success is compar:-
tively rare.

If sulphocyanate of potash be added to the ammonio-citrate or ammonio-
tartrate of iron, the peculiar red color which that test induces on persalts of
the metal is not produced, but it appears at once on adding a drop or two of
dilute sulphurie or nitric acid. This circumstance, joined to the perfect neu-
trality of these salts, and their power, in such neutral solution, of enduring,
undecomposed, a boiling heat, contrary to the usual habitudes of the peroxide
of iron, together with their singular transformation by the action of light to
proto-salts, in apparent opposition to a very strong affinity, has, I confess,
inclined me to speculate on the possibility of their ferruginous base existing in
them, not in the ordinary form of peroxide, but in one isomeric with it. The .
nonformation of Prussian blue, when their solutions are mixed with prussiate
of potash, and the formation in its place of a deep violet-colored liquid of
singular instability under the action of light, seem to favor this idea. Nor is
it altogether impossible that the peculiar ‘“ prepared” state superficially as-
sumed by iron under the influence of nitric acid, first noticed by Keir, and since
made the subject of experiment by M. ScOhnbein and myself, may depend on a
change superficially operated on the iron itself into a new metallic body isomeric
with iron, unoxidable by nitric acid, and which may be considered as the
radical of that peroxide which exists in the salts in question, and possibly also
of an isomeric protoxide. A combination of the common protoxide with the
isomeric peroxide, rather than with the same metal in a simply higher stage of
oxidation, would afford a not unplausible notion of the chemical nature of that
peculiar intermediate oxide to which the name of “ Ferrosoferric”’ has been
given by Berzelius. If (to render my meaning more clear) we for a moment
consent to designate such an isomeric form of iron by the name sideriwm, the
oxide in question might be regarded as a sideriate of iron. Both phosphorus
and arsenic (bodies remarkable for sequi Combinations) admit isomeric forms
in their oxides and acids. But to return from this digression.

If to a mixture of ammonio-citrate of iron and sulphocyanate of potash a
small dose of nitric acid be added, the resulting red liquid, spread on paper,
spontaneously whitens in the dark. If more acid be added till the point is
attained when the discoloration begins to relax, and the paper when dry retains
a considerable degree of color, it is powerfully affected by light, and receives <
positive picture with great rapidity, which appears at the back of the paper
with even more distinctness than on its face. The impression, however, is pallid,
fades on keeping, nor am I acquainted at present with any mode of fixing it. “
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 167

If paper be washed with a mixture of the solution of ammonio-citrate of iron
and ferrosesquicyanate of potash, so as to contain the two salts in about equal
proportions, and, being then impressed with a picture, be thrown into water and
dried, a negative blue image will be produced. This picture I have found to be
susceptible of a very curious transformation, preceded by total obliteration. To
effect this it must be washed with solution of proto-nitrate of mercury, which
in a little time entirely discharges it. The nitrate being thoroughly washed
out and the picture dried, a smooth iron is to be passed over it, Somewhat hotter
than is used for ironing linen, but not sufficiently so to scorch or injure the
paper. The obliterated picture immediately reappears, not blue, but brown.
If kept for some weeks in this state between the leaves of a portfolio, in com-
plete darkness, it fades and at length almost entirely disappears. But, what is
very singular, a fresh application of the heat revives and restores it to its full
intensity.

This curious transformation is instructive in another way. It is not op-
erated by light; at least not by light alone. A certain temperature must be
attained, and that temperature suffices in total darkness. Nevertheless, I find
that on exposing to a very concentrated spectrum (collected by a lens of short
focus) a slip of paper duly prepared as above—that is to say, by washing with
the mixed solutions, exposure to sunshine, washing, and discharging the uni-
form blue color so induced, as in the last article—its whiteness is changed to
brown over the whole region of the red and orange rays, but not beyond the
luminous spectrum. ‘Three conclusions seem unayoidable: First, that it is the
heat of these rays, not their light, which operates the change; second, that
this heat possesses a peculiar chemical quality which is not possessed by the
purely calorific rays outside of the visible spectrum, though far more intense;
and, third, that the heat radiated from obscurely hot iron abounds especially
in rays analogous to those of the region of the spectrum above indicated.

Sir John Herschel then proceeds to show that, whatever be the state
of the iron in the double salts in question, its reduction by blue light
to the state of protoxide is indicated by many other reagents. Thus,
for example, if a shp of paper prepared with the ammonio-citrate of
iron be exposed partially to sunshine and then washed with the
bichromate of potash, the bichromate is deoxidized and precipitated
upon the sunned portion, just as it would be if directly exposed to the
sun’s rays.

I have proved this fact with a great number of preparations of
cobalt, nickel, bismuth, platinum, and other salts which have been
thought hitherto to be insensible to solar agency; but if they are par-
tially sunned, and then washed with nitrate of silver and put aside
in the dark the metallic silver is slowly reduced upon the sunned
portion. In many instances days were required to produce the visible
picture; and in one case paper, being washed with neutral chloride
of platinum, were sunned, and then washed in the dark with nitrate
of silver; it was some weeks before the image made its appearance,
but it was eventually perfectly developed. This specimen has been
kept for several years, and continues constantly to improve in clearness
and definition.
168 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

CHRYSOTYPE.

A process of an analogous character to that which has just been
described, and in which the chloride of gold is an agent, must be next
described. This was discovered at the same time as the cyanotype,
and has been termed the chrysotype.

In order to ascertain whether any portion of the iron in the double ammoniacal
salt employed had really undergone deoxidation and become reduced to the
state of protoxide, as supposed, I had recourse to a solution of gold exactly
neutralized by carbonate of soda. The protosalts of iron, as is well-known to
chemists, precipitate gold in the metallic state. The effect proved exceedingly
striking, issuing in a process no wise inferior in the almost magical beauty of its
effect to the calotype process of Mr. Talbot, which in some respects it nearly
resembles; with this advantage, as a matter of experimental exhibition, that
the disclosure of the dormant image does not require to be performed in the
dark, being not interferred with by moderate daylight. As the experiment will
probably be repeated by others, I shall here describe it ab initio. Paper is to
be washed with a moderately concentrated solution of ammonio-citrate of iron
and dried. The strength of the solution should be such as to dry into a good
yellow color, not at all brown. In this state it is ready to receive a photo-
graphic image, which may be impressed on it either from nature in the camer:
obscura, or from an engraving on a frame in sunshine. The image so impressed,
however, is very faint and sometimes hardly perceptible. The moment it is
removed from the frame or camera it must be washed over with a neutral
solution of gold of such strength as to have about the color of sherry wine.
Instantly the picture appears, not, indeed, at once of its full intensity, but dark-
ening with great rapidity up to a certain point, depending on the strength of the
solution used, etc. At this point nothing can surpass the sharpness and perfec-
tion of detail of the resulting photograph. To arrest this process and to fix the
picture (so far at least as the further agency of light is concerned), it is to be
thrown into water very slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid and well soaked,
dried, washed with hydrobromate of potash, rinsed, and dried again.

Such is the outline of a process to which I propose applying the name of
chrysotype in order to recall by similarity of structure and termination the
calotype process of Mr. Talbot, to which in its general effect it affords so close a
parallel. Being very recent, I have not yet (June 10, 1842) obtained a complete
command over all its details, but the termination of the session of the society
being close at hand I have not thought it advisable to suppress its mention. In
point of direct sensibility the chrysotype paper is certainly inferior to the cal-
otype, but it is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of gold as a photo-
graphic ingredient that extremely feeble impressions once made by light go on
efterwards darkening spontaneously and very slowly, apparently without limit,
so long as the least vestige of unreduced chloride of gold remains in the paper.
To illustrate this curious and (so far as applications go) highly important
property, I shall mention incidentally the results of some experiments made
during the late fine weather on the habitudes of gold in presence of oxalic acid.
Tt is well known to chemists that this acid heated with solutions of gold precipi-
tates the metal in its metallic state. It is upon this property that Berzelius has
founded his determination of the atomic weight of gold. Light as well as heat
also operates this precipitation, but to render it effectual several conditions are
necessary : First, the solution of gold must be neutral, or at most very slightly
acid; second, the oxalic acid must be added in the form of a neutral oxalate;

and third, it must be present in a certain considerable quantity, which quan-
tity must be greater the greater the amount of free acid present in the chloride.
Under these conditions the gold is precipitated by light as a black powder if the
liquid be in any bulk, and if merely washed over paper a stain is produced,
which, however feeble at first, under a certain dosage of the chloride, oxalate,
and free acid, goes on increaseing from day to day and from week to week,
when laid by in the dark, and especially in a damp atmosphere, till it acquires
almost the blackness of ink, the unsunned portion of the paper remaining un-
affected, or so slightly as to render it almost certain that what little action of
the kind exists is due to the effect of casual dispersed light incident in the
preparation of the paper. I have before me a specimen of paper so treated in
which the effect of thirty seconds’ exposure to sunshine was quite invisible at
first and which is now of so intense a purple as may well be called black, while
the unsunned portion has acquired comparatively but a very slight brown.
And (which is not a little remarkable and indicates that in the time of expos-
ure mentioned the maximum of effect was attained) other portions of the same
paper exposed in graduated progression for longer times, viz, one minute, two
minutes, and three minutes, are not in the least perceptible degree darker than
the portion on which the light had acted during thirty seconds only.

If paper prepared as above recommended for the chrysotype, either with the
ammonio-citrate or ammonio-tartrate of iron, and impressed, as in that process,
with a latent picture, be washed with nitrate of silver instead of a solution of
gold, a very sharp and beautiful picture is developed of great intensity. Its
disclosure is not instantaneous ; a few moments elapse without apparent effect.
The dark shades are then first touched in, and by degrees the details appear,
but much more slowly than in the case of gold. In two or three minutes,
however, the maximum of distinctness will not fail to be attained. The picture
may be fixed by the hyposulphite of soda, which alone, I believe, can be fully
depended on for fixing argentine photographs.

The best process for fixing any of the photographs prepared with gold is as
follows: As soon as the picture is satisfactorily brought out by the auriferous
liquid it is to be rinsed in spring water, which must be three times renewed,
letting it remain in the third water five or ten minutes. It is then to be blotted
off and dried, after which it is to be washed on both sides with a somewhat
weak solution of hydriodate of potash (iodide of potassium). If there be any
free chloride of gold present in the pores of paper, it will be discolored, the
_lights: passing to a ruddy brown; but they speedily whiten again spontaneously,
or at all events on throwing it (after lying a minute or two) into fresh water,
in which, being again rinsed and dried, it is now perfectly fixed.

PHOTOGRAPHIC PROPERTIES OF MERCURY.

As an agent in the daguerreotype process, it is not, strictly speaking, photo-
graphically affected. It operates there only in virtue of its readiness to
amalgamate with silver properly prepared to receive it. That it possesses
direct photographic susceptibility, however, in a very eminent degree, is proved
by the following experiment: Let a paper be washed over with a weak solution
of periodide of iron, and, when dry, with a solution of proto-nitrate of mer-
cury. <A bright yellow paper is produced, which (if the right strength of the
liquids be hit) is exceedingly sensitive while wet, darkening to a brown color
in a very few seconds in the sunshine. Withdrawn, the impression fades
rapidly, and the paper in a few hours recovers its original color. In operating
this change of color the whole spectrum is affective, with the exception of the
thermic rays beyond the red.

170 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

Proto-nitrate of mercury simply washed over paper is slowly and feebly
blackened by exposure to sunshine. And if paper be impregnated with the
ammonio-citrate of iron, already so often mentioned, partially sunned, and then
washed with the proto-nitrate, a reduction of the latter salt, and consequently
blackening of the paper, takes place very slowly in the dark over the sunned
portion, to nearly the same amount as in the direct action of the light on the
simply nitrated paper.

But if the mercurial salt be subjected to the action of light in contact with
the ammonio-citrate or tartrate, the effect is far more powerful. Considering
at present only the citric double salt, a paper prepared by washing first
with that salt and then with the mercurial proto-nitrate (drying between) is
endowed with considerable sensibility and darkens to a very deep brown, hay,
te complete blackness, on a moderate exposure to good sun. Very sharp and
intense photographs of a negative character may be thus taken. They are,
however, difficult to fix. The only method which I have found at all to suc-
ceed has been by washing them with bichromate of potash and soaking them
for twenty-four hours in water, which dissolves out the chromate of mercury
for the most part, leaving, however, a yellow tint on the ground, which resists
obstinately. But though pretty effectually fixed in this way against light,
they are not so against time, as they fade considerably on keeping.

When the proto-nitrate of mercury is mixed in solution with either of the
aimmoniacal double salts it forms a precipitate, which, worked up with a brush
to the consistence of cream and spread upon paper, produces very fine pictures,
the intensity of which it is almost impossible to go beyond. Most unfortu-
nately they can not be preserved. Every attempt to fix them has resulted in
the destruction of their beauty and force; and even when kept from light they
fade with more or less rapidity, some disappearing almost entirely in three
or four days, while others have resisted tolerably well for a fortnight or even a
month. It is to an overdose of tartaric acid that their more rapid deterioration
seems to be due, and of course it is important to keep down the proportion of
this ingredient as low as possible. But without it I have never succeeded in
producing that peculiar velvety aspect on which the charm of these pictures
chiefly depends, nor anything like the same intensity of color without over-
sunning,

FERROTARTRATE OF SILVER.

Extending his inquiries still further into these very remarkable
changes, the following process presented itself to Sir J. Herschel,
which is in many respects remarkable:

If nitrate of silver, specific gravity 1:200, be added to ferro-
tartaric acid, specific gravity 1-023, a precipitate falls which is in
great measure redissolved by a gentle heat, leaving a black sediment,
which, being cleared by subsidence, a liquid of a pale yellow color is
obtained, in which a further addition of the nitrate causes no turbid-
ness. When the total quantity of the nitrated solution amounts to
about half the bulk of the ferrotartaric acid it is enough. The
liquid so prepared does not alter by keeping in the dark.

Spread on paper and exposed wet to the sunshine (partly shaded)
for a few seconds no impression seems to have beeft made; but by
degrees (although withdrawn from the action of the light) it de-

velops itself spontaneously, and at length becomes very intense.
But if the paper be thoroughly dried in the dark (in which state it
is of a very pale greenish-yellow color) it possesses the singular prop-
erty of receiving a dormant or invisible picture, to produce which (if
it be, for instance, an engraving that is to be copied), from thirty
seconds’ to a minute’s exposure in the sunshine is requisite. It should
not be continued too long, as not only is the ultimate effect less strik-
ing, but a picture begins to be visibly produced, which darkens spon-
taneously after it is withdrawn. But if the exposure be discontinued
before this effect comes on an invisible impression is the result, to de-
velop which all that is necssary is to breathe upon it, when it imme-
diately appears, and very speedily acquires an extraordinary inten-
sity and sharpness as if by magic. Instead of the breath it may be
subjected to the regulated action of aqueous vapor by laying it in a
blotting-paper book of which some of the outer leaves on both sides
have been dampened, or by holding it over warm water.

Many preparations, both of silver and gold, possess a similar prop-
erty in an inferior degree, but none that I have yet met with to any-
thing like the extent of that above described.

These pictures do not admit of being permanently fixed; they are
so against the action of light, but not against the operations of time.
They slowly fade out even in the dark, and in some examples which I
have prepared the remarkable phenomenon of a restoration after
fading, but with reversed lights and shades, has taken place.

THE AMPHITYPE.

The following very remarkable process was communicated by Sir
John Herschel at the meeting of the British Association at York.
The process can not be regarded as perfect, but from its beauty when
success is obtained and the curious nature of all its phenomena it is
deemed important to include it in the hope of inducing some investi-
gator to take it up.

Sir John Herschel says, alluding to the processes just described :

I had hoped to have perfected this process so far as to have reduced it to a
a definite statement of manipulations which would insure success. But capri-
cious as photographic processes notoriously are, this has proved so even beyond
the ordinary measure of such caprice. * * * Paper proper for producing an amphi-
type picture may be prepared either with the ferrotartrate or the ferrocitrate
of the protoxide or the peroxide of mercury, or of the protoxide of lead, by
using creams of these salts, or by successive applications of the nitrates of the
respective oxides, singly or in mixture, to the paper, alternating with solutions
of the ammonio-tartrate or ammonio-citrate of iron, the latter solution being
last applied and in more or less excess. * * * Paper so prepared. and dried
takes a negative picture in time varying from half an hour to five or six
hours, according to the intensity of the light; and the impression produced

Ue HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

the highest conceivable fullness and richness both of tint and detail, the color
in this case being a superb velvety brown. This extreme richness of effect is
not produced except Jead be present either in the ingredients used or in the
paper itself. It is not, as I originally supposed, due to the presence of free
tartaric acid. The pictures in this state are not permanent. They fade in the
dark, though with very different degrees of rapidity, some (especially if free
tartaric or citric acid be present) in a few days, while others remain for weeks
unimpaired and require whole years for their total obliteration. But, though
entirely faded out in appearance the picture is only rendered dormant, and may
be restored, changing its character from negative to positive and its color from
brown to black (in the shadows), by the following process: A bath being pre-
pared by pouring a small quantity of solution of pernitrate of mercury into a
large quantity of water and letting the subnitrated precipitate subside, the pic-
ture must be immersed in it (carefully and repeatedly: clearing off the air
bubbles) and allowed to remain till the picture (if anywhere visible) is entirely
destroyed, or, if faded, till it is judged sufficient from previous experience, a
term which is often marked by the appearance of a feeble positive picture of
a bright yellow hue on the pale-yellow ground of the paper. <A long time
(several weeks) is often required for this, but heat accelerates the action, and
it is often complete in a few hours. In this state the picture is to be very thor-
oughly rinsed and soaked in pure warm water and then dried. It is then to
be well ironed with a smooth iron, heated so as barely not to injure the paper,
placing it, for better security against scorching, between smooth clean papers.
If, then, the process has been successful, a perfectly black positive picture
is at once developed. At first it most commonly happens that the whole picture
is sooty or dingy to such a degree that it is condemned as spoiled, but on keeping
it between the leaves of a book, especially in a moist atmosphere, by extremely
slow degrees this dinginess disappears, and the picture disengages itself with
continually increasing sharpness and clearness, and acquires the exact effect
of a copperplate engraving on a paper more or less tinted with pale yellow.

I ought to observe that the best and most uniform specimens which I have
procured have been on paper previously washed with certain preparations of
uric acid, which is a very remarkable and powerful photographic element.
The intensity of the original negative picture is no criterion of what may be
expected in the positive. It is from the production, by one and the same action
of the light, of either a positive or a negative picture, according to the subse-
quent manipulations, that I have designated the process thus generally
sketched out by the term “Amphitype,’ a name suggested by Mr. Talbot, to
whom I communicated this singular result; and to this process or class of
processes (which I can not doubé when pursued will lead to some very beautiful
results) I propose to restrict the name in question, though it applies even more
appropriately to the following exceedingly curious and remarkable one in
which silver is concerned. At the last meeting I announced a mode of produ-
cing, by means of a solution of silver in conjunction with ferro-tartaric acid, a
dormant picture brought out into a forcible negative impression by the breath
or moist air. The solution then described, and which had at that time been
prepared some weeks, I may here incidentally remark, has retained its limpidity
and photographic properties quite unimpaired during the whole year since
elapsed, and is now as sensitive as eyer—a property of no small value. Now,
when a picture (for example, an impression from an engraving) is taken on
paper washed with this solution it shows no sign of a picture on its back,
whether that on its face be developed or not; but if, while the actinic influence
is still fresh upon the face (i. e., as soon as it is removed from the light), the
back be exposed for a very few seconds to sunshine and then removed to a

gloomy place, a positive picture, the exact complement of the negative one on the
other side, though wanting of course in sharpness if the paper be thick, slowly
and gradually makes its appearance there, and in half an hour acquires con-
siderable intensity. I ought to mention that the ferro-tartaric acid in question
is prepared by precipitating the ferro-tartrate of ammonia by acetate of lead
and decomposing the precipitate by dilute sulphuric acid.

THE COLORING MATTER OF FLOWERS.

The results obtained by Sir John Herschel on the coloring juices of
flowers are too remarkable to be omitted in a treatise in which it is
desirable that every point should be registered up to the date of pub-
lication, which connects itself with the phenomena of chemical change
apphed to photography :

In operating on the colors of flowers I have usually proceeded as follows:
The petals of the fresh flowers, or rather such parts of them as possessed a
vniform tint, were crushed to a pulp in a marble mortar, either alone or with
addition of alcohol, and the juice expressed by squeezing the pulp in a clean
linen or cotton cloth. It was then spread on paper with a flat brush and dried
in the air without artificial heat, or, at most, with the gentle warmth which
rises in the ascending current of air from an Arnott stove. If alcohol be not
added, the application on paper must be performed immediately, since exposure
to the air of the juices of most flowers (in some cases even but for a few
minutes) irrecoverably changes or destroys their color. If alcohol be present,
this change does not usually take place or is much retarded, for which reason,
as well as on account of certain facilities afforded by its admixture in procur-
ing an even tint (to be presently stated), this addition was commonly but not
always made.

Most flowers give out their coloring matter readily enough either in alcohol
or water. Some, however, as the Escholzias and Calceolarias, refuse to do so,
and require the addition of alkalies; others of acids, ete. When alcohol is
“added, it should, however, be observed that the tint is often apparently much
enfeebled or even discharged altogether, and that the tincture when spread on
paper does not reappear of its blue intensity till after complete drying. The
temporary destruction of the color of blue heartsease by alcohol is curious, nor
is it by any means a singular instance. In some, but in very few cases, it is
destroyed, so as neither to reappear on drying nor to be capable of revival by
any means tried. And in all cases long keeping deteriorates the colors and alters
the qualities of the alcoholic tinctures themselves, so that they should always
be used as fresh as possible.

If papers tinged with vegetable colors are intended to be preserved, they
must be kept perfectly dry and in darkness. A close tin vessel, the air of
which is dried by quicklime carefully inclosed in double paper bags well
pasted at the edges to prevent the dust escaping, is used for this purpose.
Moisture, as already mentioned, especially assisted by heat, destroys them for
the most part rapidly, though some, as the color of the Senecio splendens, resist
obstinately. Their destructibility by this agency, however, seems to bear no
distinct relation to their photographic properties.

This is also the place to observe that the color of a flower is by no means
always or usually that which its expressed juice imparts to white paper. In
many cases the tints so imparted have no resemblance to the original hue.
Thus, to give only a few instances, the red damask rose, of that intense variety
174 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

of color commonly called by florists the black rose, gives a dark slate blue, as
do also the clove carnation and the black hollyhock ; a fine dark brown variety
of sparaxis give a dull olive green, and a beautiful rose-colored tulip a dirty
bluish-green; but perhaps the most striking case of the kind is that of a
common sort of red poppy (Papaver Rheum), whose expressed juice imparts
to paper a rich and most beautiful blue color, whose elegant properties as a
photographic material will be further alluded to hereafter.¢

This change of color is probably owing to different causes in different flowers.
In some it undoubtedly arises from the escape of carbonic acid, but this, as a
general cause for the change from red to blue, has, I am aware, been contro-
verted. In some (as is the case with the yellow ranunculi) it seems to arise
from a chemical alteration depending on absorption of oxygen; and in others,
especially where the expressed juice coagulates on standing, to a loss of
vitality or disorganization of the molecules. The fresh petal of a single flower,
merely crushed by rubbing on dry paper and instantly dried, leaves a stain
much more nearly approximating to the original hue. This, for example, is
the only way in which the fine blue color of the common field veronica can be
imparted to paper. Its expressed juice, however quickly prepared, when laid
on with a brush, affords only a dirty neutral gray, and so of many others. But
in this way no even tint can be had, which is a first requisite to the experiments
now in question as well as to their application to photography.

To secure this desirable evenness of tint the following manipulation will
generally be found successful: The paper should be moistened at the back by
sponging and blotting off. It should then be pinned on a board, the moist side
downward, so that two of its edges (suppose the right-hand and lower ones)
shall project a little beyond those of the board. The board being then inclined
twenty or thirty degrees to the horizon, the alcoholic tincture (mixed with a
very little water, if the petals themselves be not very juicy) is to be applied
with a brush in strokes from left to right, taking care not to go over the
edges which rest on the board, but to pass clearly over those which project,
and observing also to carry the tint from below upward by quick sweeping
strokes, leaving no dry spaces between them, but keeping up a continuity of
wet surface. When all is wet, cross them by another set of strokes from
above downward, so managing the brush as to leave no floating liquid on the
paper. It must then be dried as quickly as possible over a stove or in a cur-
rent of warm air, avoiding, however, such heat as may injure the tint. The
presence of alcohol prevents the solution of the gummy principle, which, when
present, gives a smeary surface; but the evenness of tint given by this process
results chiefly from that singular intestine movement which always takes
place when alcoho! is in the act of separation from water by evaporation a
movement which disperses knots and blots in the film of liquid with great
energy and spreads them over the surrounding surface.

Corchorus japonica.—The flowers of this common and hardy but highly orna-
mental plant are of a fine yellow, somewhat inclining to orange, and this is
also the color which the expressed juice imparts to paper. As the flower begins
to fade the petals whiten, an indication of their photographic sensibility which
is amply verified on exposure of the stained paper to sunshine. I have hitherto
met with no vegetable color so sensitive. If the flowers be gathered in the
height of their season, paper so colored (which is of a very beautiful and even
vellow) begins to discolor in ten or twelve minutes in clear sunshine and in

aA semicultivated variety was used haying dark purple spots at the bases
of the petals. The common red poppy of the chalk (Papavier hybridum) gives
a purple color much less sensitive and beautiful.
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. V5

half an hour is completely whitened. The color seems to resist the first impres-
sion of the light, as if by some remains of vitality, which, being overcome, the
tint gives way at once,-and the discoloration when commenced goes on rapidly.
It does not even cease in the dark when once begun. Hence it happens that
photographic impressions taken on such paper, which when fresh are very
sharp and beautiful, fade by keeping, visibly from day to day, however carefully
preserved from light. They require from half an hour to an hour to complete,
according to the sunshine. Hydriodate of potash cautiously applied retards
considerably, but does not untimately prevent this spontaneous discharge.

Common ten weeks’ stocks; Mathiola annua.—Paper stained with the tinc-
ture of this flower is changed to a vivid scarlet by acids and to green by alka-
lies. If ammonia be used, the red color is restored as the ammonia evaporates,
proving the absence of any acid quality in the coloring matter sufficiently ener-
getic to coerce the elastic force of the alkaline gas. Sulphurous acid whitens
it, as does the alkaline sulphites, but this effect is transient, and the red color
is slowly restored by free exposure to air, especially with the aid of light,
whose influence in this case is the more remarkable, being exactly the reverse
of its ordinary action on this coloring principle, which it destroys irrecoverably,
as above stated. The following experiments were made to trace and illustrate
this curious change:

Two photographie copies of engravings taken on paper tinted with this color
were placed in a jar of sulphurous-acid gas, by which they were completely
whitened and all traces of the pictures obliterated. They were then exposed to
free air, the one in the dark, the other in sunshine. Both recovered, but the
former much more slowly than the latter. The restoration of the picture
exposed to the sun was completed in twenty-four hours, that in the dark not
till after a lapse of two or three days.

A slip of the stained paper was wetted with liquid sulphurous acid and laid
on blotting paper similarly wetted. Being then crossed with a strip of black
paper, it was laid between glass plates and (evaporation of the acid being thus
prevented) was exposed to full sunshine. After some time the red color (in
spite of the presence of the acid) was considerably restored in the portion
exposed, while the whole of the portion covered by the black paper remained,
of course, perfectly white.

Slips of paper stained as above were placed under a receiver beside a small
capsule of liquid sulphurous acid. When completely discolored they were sub-
jected (on various occasions and after various lengths of exposure to the acid
fumes, from half an hour to many days) to the action of the spectrum, and it

yas found, as, indeed, I had expected, that the restoration of color was oper-
ated by rays complementary to those which destroy it in the natural state of
the paper, the violet rays being chiefiy active, the blue almost equally so, the
green little, and the yellow, orange, and most refrangible red not at all. In one
experiment a pretty well defined red solar image was developed by the least
refrangible red rays also, being precisely those for which, in the unprepared
paper, the discoloring action is abruptly cut off. But this spot I never suc-
ceeded in reproducing; and it ought also to be mentioned that, according to
differences in the preparation not obvious, the degree of sensibility, generally,
of the bleached paper to the restorative action of light differed greatly, in some
cases a perceptible reddening being produced in ten seconds and a considerable
streak in two minutes, while in others a very long time was required to produce
any effect. The dormancy of this coloring principle under the influence of sul-
phurous acid is well shown by dropping a little weak sulphuric acid on the
paper bleached by that gas, which immediately restores the red color in all its
176 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

vigor. In like manner alkalies restore the color, converting it at the same time
into green.

Papaver orientale.—The chemical habitudes of the sulphurous acid render it
highly probable that its action in including a dormant state of the colorific
principle consists in a partial deoxidizement, unaccompanied, however, with
disorganization of its molecules. And this view is corroborated by the similar
action of alcohol already spoken of—similar, that is, in kind, though less com-
plete in degree. Most commonly vegetable colors weakened by the action of
alcohol are speedily restored on the total evaporation of the ingredient. But
one remarkable instance of absolute dormancy induced by that agent has
occurred to me in the case of Papaver orientale, a flower of a vivid orange
color, bordering on scarlet, the coloring matter of which is not extractable
otherwise than by alcohol, and then only in a state so completely masked as to
impart no more than a faint yellowish or pinkish hue to paper, which it retains
when thoroughly dry, and apparently during any length of time, without per-
ceptible increase of tint. If at any time, however, a drop of weak acid be
applied to paper prepared with this tincture a vivid scarlet color is immediately
developed, thus demonstrating the continued though latent existence of the
coloring principle. On observing this, it occurred to me to inquire whether, in
its dormant state, that principle still retained its susceptibility of being acted
on by light, since the same powerful and delicate agent which had been shown,
in sO Many cases as to constitute a general law, capable of disorganizing and
destroying vegetable colors actually developed might easily be presumed com-
petent to destroy the capacity for assuming color, in such organic matter as
might possess it, under the influence of their otherwise appropriate chemical
stimuli. <A strip of the paper was therefore exposed for an hour or two to
the spectrum, but without any sensible effect, the whole surface being equally
reddened by an acid. As this experiment sufliciently indicated the action. of
light, if any, to be very slow, I next placed a strip, partly covered, in a south-
east window, where it remained from June 19 to August 19, receiving the few
and scanty sunbeams which that interval of the deplorable summer of 1841
afforded. When removed, the part exposed could barely be distinguished from
the part shaded as a trifle yellower. But on applying acid the exposed and
shaded portions were at once distinguished by the assumption of a vivid red
in the latter and the former remaining unchanged.

A mezzotinto picture was now pressed on a glazed frame over another por-
tion of the same paper and abandoned on the upper shelf of a greenhouse to
whatever sun might occur from August 19 to October 19. The interval proved
one of almost uninterrupted storm, rain, and darkness. On remoyal no appear-
ance whatever of any impressed picture could be discerned, nor was it even
possible to tell the top of the picture from the bottom. It was then exposed in
g glass jar to the fumes of muriatic acid, when, after a few minnutes, the
development of the dormant picture commenced and slowly proceeded, disclosing
the details in a soft and pleasing style. Being then laid by in a drawer, with
free access of air, the picture again faded by very slow degrees, and on January
2, 1842, was found quite obliterated. Being then subjected to the acid vapor,
the color was reproduced. :

Viola odorata.—Chemists are familiar with the color of this flower as a test
of acids and alkalies, for which, however, it seems by no means better adapted
than many others; less so, indeed, than that of the Viola tricolor, the common
purple iris, and many others which might be named. It offers, in fact, another
and rather a striking instance of the simultaneous existence of two coloring
ingredients in the same flower, comporting themsleves differently, not only in
regard to light but to chemical agents. Extracted with alcohol, the juice of the
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. hae
violet is of a rich blue color, which it imparts in high perfection to paper.
Exposed to sunshine, a portion of this color gives way pretty readily, but a
residual blue, rather inclining to greenish, resists obstinately and requires a
very much longer exposure (for whole weeks, indeed) for its destruction, which is
not even then complete. Photographic impressions, therefore, taken on this
paper, though very pretty. are exceedingly tedious in their preparation if we
would have the lights sharply made out.

Sparaxis tricolor?, var.—Stimulating effects of alkalies —Among a great many
hybrid varieties of this genus, lately forwarded to me from the Cape, occurred
one of a very intense purplish brown color, nearly black. The alcoholic extract
of this flower in its liquid state is rich crimson brown. Spread on paper, it
imparted a dark olive-green color, which proved perfectly insensible to very
prolonged action, either of sunshine or the spectrum. The addition of carbonate
of soda changed the color of this tincture to a good green, slightly inclining to
olive, and which imparted the same tint to paper. In this state, to my sur-
prise, it manifested rather a high degree of photographie sensibility, and gave
very pretty pictures with a day or two of exposure to sunshine. When pre-
pared with the fresh juice there is hardly any residual tint, but if the paper be
kept a great amount of indestructible yellow remains outstanding. The action
is confined chiefly to the negative end of the spectrum; all but the first five or
six parts beyond the yellow show little more than a trace of action. A photo?
graph impressed on this paper is reddened by muriatic acid fumes. If then
transferred to an atmosphere of ammonia, and when supersaturated the excess
of alkali allowed to exhale, it is fixed, and of a dark-green color. Both the tint
and sharpness of the picture, however, suffer in this process.

Red poppy: Papaver Rhewmn?.—Among the vegetable colors totally destroyed
by light, or which leave no residual tint, at least when fresh prepared, perhaps
the two most rich and beautiful are those of the red poppy and the double purple
groundsel (Senecio splendens). The former owes its red color in all proba-
bility to free carbonic acid or some other, as the acetic, completely expelled by
drying, for the color its tincture imparts to paper, instead of red is a fine blue,
very slightly verging on slate blue. But it has by no means the ordinary
chemical characters of blue vegetable colors. Carbonate of soda, for instance,
does not in the least degree turn the expressed juice green, and when washed
with the mixture a paper results of a light slate gray, hardly at all inclining to
green. The blue tincture is considerably sensitive, and from the richness of its
tone and the absence of residual tint, paper stained with it affords photographic
impressions of great beauty and sharpness, some of which will be found among
the collection submitted with this paper for inspection.

Senecio splendens.—This fiower yields a rich purple juice in great abundance
and of surprising intensity. Nothing can exceed the rich and velvety tint of
paper tinted while it is fresh. It is, however, not very sensible to light, and
many weeks are necessary to obtain a good photographic impression.

In the progress of my own researches on this subject I found that
the green coloring matter of the leaves of herbaceous plants when
spread upon paper changed with tolerable rapidity when exposed to
sunshine. There are, however, some very curious points connected
with the phenomena of these changes which demand a far more ex-
tensive investigation than they have yet received.

I find that the juices taken from the leaves in the spring change
more rapidly than when expressed from the same plants in the
178 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

autumn, and the juices of those flowering plants which have been
cultivated under the artificial circumstances of a storehouse or con-
servatory are more readily affected than such as are grown in the
open air. Many of the experiments just described furnish very in-
structive examples of the operations of the solar rays upon organic
bodies, from which we may deduce important truths connected with
natural phenomena.

II. MiscenuANrous PROCESSES.
MR. PONTON’S PROCESS (BICHROMATE OF POTASH).

Under the general term of the chromatype I would propose to 1n-
clude all those processes which involve the use of any of the salts of
chromium. It was originally introduced to distinguish a particular
process which I discovered, and published at the meeting of the
British Association at Cork, in August, 1843; but it appears very
convenient to adopt the principle introduced by Sir John Herschel,
of grouping the phenomena of photography under special terms
derived from the most prominent chemical preparation employed.

There are many preparations which are affected by light in a sim-
ilar manner to the salts of silver. Several have been tried as photo-
graphic materials, but as yet without much success, with the excep-
tion of the bichromate of potash, which was first announced as a use-
ful photographic agent by Mr. Mungo Ponton in the Edinburgh New
Philosophical Journal, from which I quote Mr. Ponton’s own account:

When paper is immersed in the bichromate of potash it is powerfully and
rapidly acted on by the sun’s rays. When an object is laid in the usual way on
this paper the portion exposed to the light speedily becomes tawny, passing
more or less into a deep orange, according to the strength of the light. The
portion covered by the objects retains the original bright yellow tint which it
had before exposure, and the object is thus represented yellow upon an orange
ground, there being several gradations of shade or tint, according to the
greater or less degree of transparency in the different parts of the object.

In this state, of course, the drawing, though very beautiful, is evanescent.
To fix it, all that is required is careful immersion in water, when it will be
found that those portions of the salt which have not been acted on by the light
are readily dissolved out, while those which haye been exposed to the light are
completely fixed on the paper. By the second process the object is obtained
white upon an orange ground and quite permanent. If exposed for many hours
together to strong sunshine, the color of the ground is apt to lose in depth, but
not more so than most other coloring matters. This action of light on the bi-
chromate of potash differs from that upon the salts of silver. Those of the
latter which are blackened by light are of themselves insoluble in water, and
it is difficult to impregnate paper with them in a uniform manner. The black-
ening seems to be caused by the formation of oxide of silver.

In the ease of the bichromate of potash, again, that salt is exceedingly solu-
ble, and paper can be easily saturated with it. The agency of light not only
changes its color, but deprives it of solubility, thus rendering it fixed in the
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 179

paper. This action appears to consist in the disengagement of free chromic
acid, which is of a deep red color and which seems to combine with the paper.
This is rendered more probable from the circumstance that the neutral chromate
exhibits no similar change. The best mode of preparing paper with bichromate
of potash is to use a saturated solution of that salt, soak the paper well in it,
and then dry it rapidly at a brisk fire, excluding it from daylight. Paper thus
prepared acquires a deep orange tint on exposure to the sun. If the solution
be less strong or the drying less rapid, the color will not be so deep. <A pleas-
ing variety may be made by using sulphate of indigo along with the bichromate
of potash, the color of the object and of the paper being then different shades
of green. In this way, also, the object may be represented of a darker shade
than the ground.

Paper prepared with the bichramate of potash, though as sensi-
tive as some of the papers prepared with the salts of silver, is much
inferior to most of them and is not sufficiently sensitive for the
camera obscura. This paper, however, answers quite well for taking
drawings from dried plants or for copying prints. Its great recom-
mendation is its cheapness and the facility with which it can be pre-
pared. The price of the bichromate of potash is about 2 shillings
per pound, while the nitrate of silver is 5 shillings an ounce.

As the deep orange ground of these pictures prevents the per-
meation of the chemical rays of light, it is very easy to procure any
number of facsimiles of an engraving by transfer from the first
negative photograph. The correct copies have a beautiful sharpness,
and, if carefully managed, but little of the minute detail of the origi-
nal engraving is lost.

A photographic paper prepared with the bichromate of potash
of another kind is described by M. E. Becquerel. He states: It is
sufficient to steep a paper prepared in Mr. Ponton’s manner, and upon
which there exists a faint copy of a drawing, in a solution of iodine in
alcohol, to wash this paper in alcohol, and then dry it; then the
parts which were white become blue, and those which were yellow
remain more or less clear.

M. E. Becquerel has pursued his investigations into the action of
the chromic acid on organic compounds, and has shown that the
mode of sizing the papers influences their coloration by light, and
that with unsized paper coloration is effected only after a long time.
Perceiving that the principal reaction resulted from the chromic
acid contained in the bichromate of potash on the starch in the size
of the paper, 1t occurred to M. E. Beequerel that as starch has the
property of forming with iodine a combination of a very fine blue
color, it should produce deep shades of that tint, while the lights
still remain an orange yellow.

His method of proceeding is to spread a size of starch very uni-
formly over the surface of the paper. It is then steeped in a weak
alcoholic solution of iodine, and afterwards washed in a great
180 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

quantity of water. By this immersion it should take a very fine blue
tint. If this is uniform, the paper is considered fit for the experi-
ment; in the contrary case it is sized again. It is then steeped in a
concentrated solution of bichromate of potash, and pressed between
folds of blotting paper and dried near the fire. To be effective it
should be very dry.

It is now fit for use. When the copy is effected, which requires in
sunshine about five minutes, the photograph is washed and dried.
When dry, it is steeped in a weak alcoholic solution of iodine, and
afterwards, when it has remained in it some time, it is washed in
water and carefully dried with blotting paper, but not at the fire,
for at a little below 100° F. the combination of iodine and starch
cliscolors.

If it be considered that the drawing is not sufficiently distinct, this
immersion may be repeateck several times, for by this means may be
obtained the intensity of tone that is desired, which intensity can be
changed at will by employing a more concentrated solution of iodine.

When the paper is damp the shades are of a very fine blue, but
when it is dry the color becomes deep violet. If while the drawing 1s
still wet it be covered with a layer of gum arabic the color of the
drawing is greatly preserved and more beautiful when it is dry.
When a paper is thus prepared it loses at first a little of its tone, but
it afterwards preserves its violet tint.

THE CHROMATYPE.

This process, devised by the author, is a pleasing one in its re-
sults. It is exceedingly simple in its manipulatory details and pro-
duces very charming positive pictures by the first application. The
chromatype is founded on the above process of Mr. Ponton’s. One
dram of sulphate of copper is dissolved in an ounce of distilled
water to which is added half an ounce of a saturated solution of bi-
chromate of potash. This solution is applied to the surface of the
paper and when dry it is fit for use, and may be kept for any length
of time without spoiling. When exposed to sunshine the first change
is to a dull brown, and if checked in this stage of the process we get
a negative picture, but if the action of the ght is continued the
browning gives way and we have a positive yellow picture on a white
eround. In either case if the paper when removed from the sun-
shine is washed over with a solution of nitrate of silver a very beau-
tiful positive picture results. In practice it will be found advanta-
geous to allow the bleaching action to go on to some extent. The pic-
ture resulting from this will be clearer and more defined than that
which is procured when the action is checked at the brown stage. To
fix these pictures it is necessary to remove the nitrate of silver, which

is done by washing in pure water. If the water contains any muri-
ates the picture suffers, and long soaking in such water obliterates it,
or if a few grains of common salt are added to the water the appar-
ent destruction is very rapid. The picture is, however, capable of
restoration, all that is necessary being to expose it to sunshine for a
quarter of an hour, when it revives, but instead of being of a red
color it becomes lilac, the shades of color depending upon the quan-
tity of salt used to decompose the chromate of silver which forms the
shadow parts of the picture.

Mr. Bingham remarks on this process, that if we substitute sul-
phate of nickel for the sulphate of copper, the paper is more sensitive
and the picture is more clearly developed by nitrate of silver.

The following modification of this process possesses some advan-
tages. If to a solution of the sulphate of copper we add a solution
of the neutral chromate of potash, a very copious brown precipitate
falls, which is a true chromate of copper. If this precipitate, after
being well washed, is added to water acidulated with sulphuric acid,
it is dissolved and a dichromatic solution is formed, which when
spread upon paper is of a pure yellow. A very short exposure of
the paper washed with this solution is quite sufficient to discharge
all the yellow from the paper and give it perfect whiteness. If an
engraving is to be copied we proceed in the usual manner; and we
may either bring out the picture by placing the paper in a solution of
carbonate of soda or potash, by which all the shadows are represented
by the chromate of copper, or by washing the paper with nitrate of
suver. It may sometimes happen that, owing to deficient hght, the
photograph is darkened all over when the silver is apphed; this
color, by keeping, is gradually removed and the picture comes out
clear and sharp.

If the chromate of copper is dissolved in ammonia, a beautiful
green solution results, and if applied to paper acts similarly to those
just described.

The chromatype pictures, under certain conditions afford a beauti-
ful example of the changes which take place slowly in the dark
from the combined operations of the materials employed.

If we take a chromatype picture after it has been developed by
the agency of either nitrate of silver or of mercury and place it
aside in the dark, it will be found after a few weeks to have darkened
considerably both in the lights and shadows. This darkening slowly
increases, until eventually the picture is obliterated beneath a film
of metallic silver or mercury; but while the picture has been fading
out on one side it has been developing itself on the other, and a very
pleasing image is seen on the back. After some considerable time
the metal on the front gives way again, the paper slowly whitens,
182 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

and eventually the image is presented on both sides of the paper of
equal intensity, in a good neutral tint upon a gray ground. These
results, it will be remembered, are of a very similar character to
those already described as peculiar to the amphitype process of
Sir John Herschel.

THE FERROTYPE.

This process, which is of remarkable sensibility, was discovered
by the author and published in the Atheneum under the name of
the “ EKnergiatype;” from a desire to group all those pictures under
a general head into which iron salts enter as an element the present
name is preferred. The preparation of the paper is as follows: Good
letter paper (Whatman’s is the best) is washed over with the fol-
lowing solution, viz: Five grains of succinic acid (it is important that
succinic free from any oil of amber or adventitious matter should be
obtained) are to be dissolved in 1 fluid ounce of water, to which are
added about 5 grains of common salt and half a dram of mucilage
of gum arabic. When dry the paper is drawn over the surface of a
solution of 60 grains of nitrate of silver in 1 ounce of distilled water.
Allowed to dry in the dark, the paper is now fit for use, is of a pure
white, retains its color, and may be preserved for a considerable
time in a portfolio until wanted for use.

The preparation of this paper is by no means difficult, but requires
care and attention. The solutions must be apphed very equally over
the paper, which should be immediately hung upon a frame or
clotheshorse to dry. Extreme care must be taken that the paper be
not exposed to light after the nitrate of silver solution has been
applied until required for use. Many of the disappointments ex-
perienced by the experimenters on the energiatype are occasioned by
a neglect of this precaution, as, although no apparent effect may have
been produced by the exposure, the clearness of the subsequent picture
will be seriously injured. The succinic acid must also be very pure.
We shall now briefly describe the method of applying this process
to the different purposes for which it is best adapted, premising that
the varying circumstances of time, place, and light will render neces-
sary such modifications of the following directions as the experience
of the operator may suggest. As a general rule, an open situation,
sunshine, and, if possible, the morning sun, should be preferred, as
the image is sharper and the color produced more intense and less
affected by the subsequent fixing process.

In the camera, for a building or statue, an exposure of half a minute
in strong sunshine is usually sufficient; for a portrait, taken under
ordinary conditions, two or three minutes are required.

When the paper is taken from the camera, nothing is visible upon
it; but by attending to the following directions the latent picture will
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 183

quickly develop itself. Having mixed together about one dram of
a saturated solution of protosulphate of iron and two or three drams
of mucilage of gum arabic, pour a small quantity into a flat dish.
Pass the prepared side of the paper taken from the camera rapidly
over this mixture, taking care to insure complete contact in every part.
If the paper has been sufficiently impressed, the picture will almost
immediately appear, and the further action of the iron must be
stopped by the application of a soft sponge and plenty of clear water.
Should the image not appear immediately, or be imperfect in its de-
tails, the iron solution may be allowed to remain upon it a short time;
but it must then be kept disturbed by rapidly but hghtly brushing it
up, otherwise numerous black specks will form and destroy the photo-
graph. Great care should be taken that the iron solution does not
touch the back of the picture, which it will inevitably stain, and, the
picture being a negative one, be rendered useless as a copy. A slight
degree of heat will assist the development of the image where the time
of exposure has been too short.

The picture should be carefully washed to take off any superficial
blackness, and may then be permanently fixed by being soaked in
water to which a small quantity of ammonia, or, better still, hypo-
sulphite of soda, has been added. The paper must again be well
soaked in clean water, to clear it from the soluble salts, and may then
be dried and pressed.

Exact copies of prints, feathers, leaves, etc., may be taken on the
succinated paper by exposing them to the light in the copying frame,
until the margin of the prepared paper, which should be left uncov-
ered, begins to change color very shghtly. If the object to be
copied is thick, the surface must be allowed to assume a darker tint,
or the light will not have penetrated to the paper.

Positive copies of the camera negatives are procured in the same
manner as the copies of the prints, etc., just described. Instead,
however, of using the iron solution, the paper must be exposed to the
light, in the frame, a sufficient time to obtain perfect copies. The
progress of the picture may be observed by turning up the corner of
the paper, and, if not sufficiently done, replacing it exactly in the
same position. They should be fixed with hyposulphite, as before
directed.

At the meeting of the British Association at York in 1844 I
showed by a series of photographs that the protosulphate of iron was
most effective in developing any photographic images on whatever
argentiferous preparation they may have been received. Every sub-
sequent result has shown that with proper care it is the most ener-
getic agent for developing with which we are acquainted. The
difficulty of obtaining and of preserving the salt free of any peroxide,
184 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

er a basic salt which falls as a brownish-yellow powder, has been the
principal cause why it has not been so generally employed as the
gallic acid. This can be insured by adding a few drops of sulphuric
acid and some iron filings to the solution of the protosulphate of iron.

THE CATALYSOTYPE.

This process of Doctor Wood’s is capable of producing pictures of
superior excellence. Owing to the inconstancy of the iodine com-
pounds, it is a httle uncertain, but, care being taken to insure the
same degree of strength in the solutions, a very uniform good result
nay be obtained. The process and its modifications are thus de-
scribed by the inventor:

Let well-glazed paper (I prefer that called wove post) be steeped in water
to which hydrochloric acid has been added in the proportion of 2 drops to 3
ounces. When well wet, let it be washed over with a mixture of sirup of
iodine of iron, half a dram; water, 24 drams; tincture of iodine, 1 drop.

When this has remained on the paper for a few minutes, so as to be imbibed,
dry it lightly with bibulous paper, and. being removed to a dark room, let it be
washed over evenly, by means of a camel-hair pencil, with a solution of nitrate
of silver, 10 grains to the ounce of distilled water. The paper is now ready
for the camera. The sooner it is used the better, as when the ingredients are
not rightly mixed it is liable to spoil by keeping. The time I generally allow
the paper to be exposed in the camera varies from two to thirty seconds; in
clear weather, without sunshine, the medium is about fifteen seconds. With
a bright light the picture obtained is of a rich brown color; with a faint light,
or a bright light for a very short time continued, it is black. For portraits
out of doors, in the shade on a clear day, the time for sitting is from ten to
fifteen seconds.

If the light is strong and the view to be taken extensive, the operator should
be cautious not to leave the paper exposed for a longer period than five or six
seconds, as the picture will appear confused from all parts being equally
acted on. In all cases the shorter the time in which the picture is taken the
better. ‘

When the paper is removed from the camera no picture is visible. However,
when left in the dark, without any other preparation being used, for a period
which varies with the length of time it was exposed and the strength of the
light, a negative picture becomes gradually developed until it arrives at a
state of perfection which is not attained, I think, by photography produced by
any other process.¢ It would seem as if the salt of silver, being slightly
affected by the light, though not in a degree to produce any visible effect on it
if alone, sets up a catalytic action, which is extended to the salts of iron and
which continues after the stimulus of the light is withdrawn. The catalysis
which then takes place has induced me to name this process, for want of a

@The picture when developed is not readily injured by exposure to moderate
light. It ought, however, to be fixed, which may be done by washing it with
a solution of bromide of potassium, 15 or 20 grains to the ounce, iodide of
potassium, 5 grains to the ounce. It may either be applied with a camel’s-hair
pencil or by immersion. The picture must then be well washed in water to
remove the fixing material, which would cause it to fade by exposure to light.
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 185

“ec

better word, the “ catalysotype.” Sir J. Herschel and Mr. Fox Talbot have
remarked the same fact with regard to other salts of iron, but I do not know
of any process being employed for photographic purposes which depends on
this action for its development except my own.

My reason for using the muriatic solution previous to washing with the iodide
of iron is this: I was for a long time tormented by seeing the pictures spoiled
by yellow patches and could not remedy it until I,observed that they presented
an appearance as if that portion of the nitrate of silver which was not decom-
posed by the iodide of iron had flowed away from the part. I then recollected
that Sir J. Herschel and Mr. Hunt had proved that iodide of silver is not very
sensitive to light unless some free nitrate be present. I accordingly tried to
keep both together on the paper, and after many plans had failed I succeeded
by steeping it in the acid solution, which makes it freely and evenly imbibe
whatever fluid is presented to it. I am sure that its utility is not confined to
this effect, but it was for that purpose that I first employed it.

My reason for adding the tincture of iodine to the sirup is, that having in my
first experiments made use of, with success, a sirup that had been for some time
prepared, and afterwards remarking that fresh sirup did not answer so well, I
examined both and found in the former a little free iodine. I therefore added
a little tincture of iodine with much benefit, and now always use it in quanti-
ties proportioned to the age of the sirup.

The following hints will, I think, enable any experimenter to be successful
in producing good pictures by this process: In the first place, the paper used
should be that called ** wove post,” or well-glazed letter paper. When the solu-
tions are applied to it, it should not immediately imbibe them thoroughly, as
would happen with the thinner sorts of paper. If the acid solution is too
strong, it produces the very effect it was originally intended to overcome—that
is, it produces yellow patches, and the picture itself is a light brick color on a
yellow ground. When the tincture of iodine is in excess, partly the same results
occur; so that if this effect is visible it shows that the oxide of silver which
is thrown down is partly redissolved by the excess of acid and iodine, and their
quantities should be diminished. On the contrary, if the silver solution is too
strong, the oxide is deposited in the dark or by an exceedingly weak light, and in
this case blackens the yellow parts of the picture, which destroys it. When
this effect of blackening all over takes place, the silver solution should be
weakened. If it be too weak, the paper remains yellow after exposure to light.
If the iodide of iron be used in too great quantity, the picture is dotted over
with black spots, which afterwards change to white. If an excess of nitrate of
silver be used, and a photograph immediately taken before the deposition of
the oxide takes place, there will be often after some time a positive picture
formed on the back of the negative one. The excess of the nitrate of silver
makes the paper blacker where the light did not act on it, and this penetrates
the paper, whereas the darkening produced by the light is confined to the sur-
face. The maximum intensity of the spectrum on the paper when a prism of
crown glass is used lies between the indigo and blue ray. The difference of
effect of a strong and weak light is beautifully shown in the action of the
spectrum; that part of the paper which is exposed to the indigo ray is colored
a reddish brown, and this is gradually darkened toward either extremity until
it becomes a deep black.

I have not had many opportunities of experimenting with the catalysotype.
but it certainly promises to repay the trouble of further investigation. The
simplicity of the process and the sensibility of the paper should cause it to be
extensively used. It has all the beauty and quickness of the calotype, without

SM 1905 16

186 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

its trouble and very little of its uncertainty, and if the more frequent use of
it by me, as compared with other processes, does not make me exaggerate its
facility of operation I think it is likely to be practiced successfully by the
most ordinary experimenters.

Doctor Woods subsequently made the following addition:

Since the preceding paper was written I have been experimenting with the
catalysotype, and one day, having had many failures, which was before quite
unusual with me, I am induced to mention the cause of them for the benefit
of subsequent experimenters. The paper I used was very stiff and highly
glazed, so that the solution first applied was not easily imbibed. The _ blot-
ting paper was very dry and bibulous. When using the latter I removed
nearly all the solution of iron from the first, and of course did not obtain the
desired result.

While varying the process in endeavoring to find out the cause just men-
tioned, I discovered that the following proportions gave very fine negative pic-
tures, from which good positive ones were obtained: Take of sirup of iodide
of iron, distilled water, each 2 drams; tincture of iodine, 10 to 12 drops; mix.
First brush this over the paper, and after the few minutes, having dried it
with the blotting paper, wash it over in the dark (before exposure in the camera)
with the following solution by means of a camel-hair pencil: Take of nitrate
of silver 1 dram; pure water, 1 ounce; mix. This gives a darker picture
than the original preparation, and consequently one better adapted for obtain-
ing positive ones; it also requires no previous steeping in an acid solution.
To fix the picture, let it be washed first in water, then allowed to remain for
a few minutes in a solution of iodide of potassium (5 grains to the ounce of
water) and washed in water again. The paper I use is the common unglazed
copy paper, but such as has a good body. I have tried the same paper with the
original preparation and find it to answer exceedingly well. It does not require
in this case, either, an acid solution. ‘The same precautions and hints apply
to the amended as to the original process, such as when it blackens in the
dark there is too much caustic used; when it remains yellow or that it is stud-
ded with yellow spots, too much iodine; when marked with black spots, too
much iron. It is necessary to mention these on account of the varying strength
of the materials employed.

FERROCYANIDE OF POTASSIUM.

At the meeting of the British Association at Plymouth in 1841 I
first directed attention to the use of the ferrocyanide of potassium
in combination with the iodide of silver. The process resulting from
this being very important in many points, the abstract of the paper
then read, as given in the Transactions of the Sections, is reprinted.

The author having been engaged in experiments on those varieties
of photographie drawings which are formed by the action of the
hydriodice salts on the darkened chloride of silver, and with a view
to the removal of the iodide formed by the process from the paper,
was led to observe some peculiar changes produced by the combined
influences of sunshine and the ferrocyanide of potassium. It was
found that the ordinary photographic paper, if allowed to darken
in sunshine, and then slightly acted on by any hydriodic solution,
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 187

and when dry washed with a solution of the ferrocyanide of potas-
sium, became extremely sensitive to light, changing from a light
brown to a full black by a moment’s exposure to sunshine. — Follow-
ing out this result, it was discovered that perfectly pure iodide of
silver was acted on with even greater rapidity, and thus became easy
to form an exquisitely sensitive photographic paper.

The method recommended is the following:

Highly glazed letter paper is washed over with a solution of 1
dram of nitrate of silver to an ounce of distilled water; it is
quickly dried and a second time washed with the same solution. It
is then, when dry, placed for a minute in a solution of 2 drams
of the iodide of potassium in 6 ounces of water, placed on a smooth
board, gently washed by allowing some water to flow over it, and
dried in the dark at common temperatures. Papers thus prepared
inay be kept for any length of time, and are at any time rendered
sensitive by simply washing them over with a solution formed of
1 dram of the ferrocyanide of potassium to an ounce of water,

These papers, washed with the ferrocyanide and dried in the dark,
are, in this dry state, absolutely insensible, but they may at any
moment be rendered sensitive by merely washing them with a little
cold clean water.

Papers thus prepared are rendered quite insensible by being washed
over with the above hydriotic solution.. They are, however, best
secured against the action of time by a solution of ammonia.

THE FLUOROTYPE.

The fluorotype, so called from the introduction of the salts of
fluoric acid, consists of the following process of manipulation :

Bromide of potassium.--. 20 grains.
fread WACCIy eS rer aes 1 fluid ounce.
Fluoride of sodium... .-.. 5 grains.
hea Watetio ses = see 1 fluid ounce.

Mix a small quantity of these solutions together when the papers
are to be prepared, and wash them once over with the mixture, and,
when dry, apply a solution of nitrate of silver, 60 grains to the ounce
of water. These papers keep for some weeks without injury and
become impressed with good images in half a minute in the camera.
The impression is not sufficiently strong when removed from the
eumera for producing positive pictures, but may be rendered so by
a secondary process.

The photograph should first be soaked in water for a few minutes
and then placed upon a slab of porcelain, and a weak solution of the
protosulphate of iron brushed over it; the picture almost imme-

diately acquires an intense color, which should then be stopped
directly by plunging it into water slightly acidulated with muriatie
acid, or the blackening will extend all over the paper. It may be
fixed by being soaked in water, and then dipped into a solution of
Lyposulphite of soda and again soaked in water as in the other
processes.

Mr. Bingham has the following remarks on this process, and he
gives a modified form, into which a new photographic element 1s
introduced :

We find it is better to add to the protosulphate of iron a little acetic or
sulphuric acid; this will be found to prevent the darkening of the lights of the
picture to a great extent, and it will be found better not to prepare the paper
long before it is required for use, this being one reason why the picture often
becomes dusky on application of the protosulphate.

Reasoning upon the principle that the action of light is to reduce the salts of
silver in the paper to the metallic state, and that any substance which would re-
duce silver would also quicken the action of light, we were led to the following
experiment: The protochloride of tin possesses the property of reducing the
salts both of silver and gold. A paper was prepared with the bromide of silver,
and previously to exposing it to light it was washed over with a very weak solu-
tion of the chloride of tin. The action of light upon the paper was exceedingly
energetic; it was almost instantaneously blackened, and a copy of a print was
obtained in a few seconds.

The use of fluorides has been recently introduced as a novelty by
some French photographers, but reference to the author’s Researches
on Light, published in 1844, will distinctly show that I was the first
to employ these salts as photographic agents.

BROMIDE OF SILVER AND MERCURIAL VAPOR.

In my first publication on this subject, in Griffin’s Scientific Mis-
cellany, I introduced the following process, which, although it has
never yet been properly worked out, involves many points of interest:
Some extremely curious results led me to examine the effect of the
mercurial vapor on the pure precipitated iodides and bromides. I
was long perplexed with exceedingly anomalous results, but, being sat-
isfied from particular experiments that these researches promised to
lead to the discovery of a sensitive preparation, I persevered.

To prepare this sensitive paper we proceed as follows: Select the
most perfect sheets of well-glazed satin post, quite free from specks
ef any kind. Placing the sheet carefully on some hard body, wash it
over on one side by means of a very soft camel’s-hair pencil with a
solution of 60 grains of the bromide of potassium in 2 fluid ounces of
distilled water and then dry it quickly by the fire. Being dry, it is
again to be washed over with the same solution and dried as before.
Now, a solution of nitrate of silver, 120 grains to the fluid ounce of
distilled water, is to be apphed over the same surface and the paper
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 189

quickly dried in the dark. In this state the papers may be kept for
use. When they are required the above solution of silver is to be
vlentifully applied and the paper placed wet in the camera, the
greatest care being taken that no daylight, not even the faintest
gleam, falls upon it, until the moment when we are prepared, by re-
moving the screen, to permit the hght radiated from the objects we
wish to copy to act in producing the picture. After a few seconds
the hght must be again shut off and the camera removed into a dark
room. It will be found on taking the paper from the box that there
is but a very slight outline, if any, as yet visible. Place it aside in
perfect darkness until quite dry, then fix it in a mercurial vapor box
and apply a very gentle heat to the mercury. The moment the mer-
cury vaporizes the picture will begin to develop itself. The spirit
lamp must now be removed for a short time, and when the action of
the mercury appears to cease it is to be very carefully applied again
until a well-defined picture is visible. The vaporization must now
be suddenly stopped and the photograph removed from the box.
The drawing will then be very beautiful and distinct, but much de-
tail is still clouded, for the development of which it is only necessary
to place it cautiously in the dark and allow it to remain undisturbed
for some hours. There is now an inexpressible charm about the pic-
ture, equaling the delicate beauty of the daguerreotypes, but being
sull very susceptible of change it must be viewed by the light of a
taper only. The nitrate of silver must now be removed from the
paper by well washing in soft water. When the picture has been
dried wash it quickly over with a soft brush dipped in a warm solu-
tion of the hyposulphite of soda and then well wash it for some time
in the manner directed for the ordinary photographs in order that
all the hyposulphite may be removed. The drawing is now fixed,
and we may use it to procure positive pictures, many of which may
be taken from one original.

To Sir John Herschel we are indebted for the first use of glass
plates to receive sensitive photographic films.

PRECIPITATES OF SILVER SALTS.

The interest which attaches to this is so great and there appear to
be in the process recommended by the English experimentalist so
many suggestive points from which future photographists may start
that the passages are given in Sir John Herschel’s own words:

With a view to ascertain how far organic matter is indispensable to the rapid
discoloration of argentine compounds, a process was tried which it may not be
190 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

amiss to relate, as it issued in a new and very pretty variety of the photographic
art. <A solution of salt of extreme dilution was mixed with nitrate of silver
so diluted as to form a liquid only slightly milky. This was poured into a
somewhat deep vessel, at the bottom of which lay horizontally a very clean
glass plate. After many days the greater part of the liquid was decanted off
with a siphon tube and the last portions very slowly and cautiously drained
away, drop by drop, by a siphon composed of a few fibers of hemp laid parallel
and moistened without twisting. The glass was not moved till quite dry and
was found coated with a pretty uniform film of chloride of silver of delicate
tenuity and chemical purity, which adhered with considerable force and was
very sensitive to light. On dropping on it a solution of nitrate of silver, how-
ever, and spreading it over by inclining the plate to and fro (which it bore
without discharging the film of chloride) it became highly sensitive, although
no organic matter could have been introduced with the nitrate, which was
quite pure, nor could any indeed have been present, unless it be supposed to
have emanated from the hempen filaments, which were barely in contact with
the edge of the glass and which were constantly abstracting matter from its
surface in place of introducing new.

Exposed in this state to the focus of a camera with the glass toward the inci-
dent light it became impressed with a remarkably well-defined negative picture
which was direct or reversed, according as looked at from the front or the back.
On pouring over this cautiously, by means of a pipette, a solution of hyposul-
phite of soda the picture disappeared, but this was only while wet, for on wash-
ing in pure water and drying it was restored and assumed much the air of a
daguerreotype when laid on a black ground, and still more so when smoked at
the back, the silvered portions reflecting most light, so that its characters had in
fact changed from negative to positive. From such a picture (of course before
smoking) I have found it practicable to take photographic copies, and although
I did not in fact succeed in attempting to thicken the film of silver by con-
necting it under a weak solution of that metal with the reducing pole of a
voltaic pile, the attempt afforded distinct indications of its practicability with
patience and perseverance, as here and there over some small portions of the
surface the lights had assumed a full metallic brilliancy under this process.
T would only mention further to those who may think this experiment worth
repeating that all my attempts to secure a good result by drying the nitrate
in the film of chloride have failed, the crystallization of the salt disturbing
the uniformity of the coating. To obtain delicate pictures the plate must be
exposed wet, and ahen withdrawn must immediately be plunged into water.
The nitrate being thus abstracted, the plate may then be dried, in which state
it is half fixed, and it is then ready for the hyposulphite. Such details of
manipulation may appear minute, but they can not be dispensed with in prac-
tice, and cost a great deal of time and trouble to discover.

This mode of coating glass with films of precipitated argentine or other com-
pounds affords, it may be observed, the only effectual means of studying their
habitudes on exposure to light, free from the powerful and eyer-varying influ-
ence of the size in paper and other materials used in its manufacture, and esti-
mating their degree of sensibility and other particulars of their deportment
under the influence of reagents. I find, for example, that glass so coated with
the iodide of silver is much more sensitive than if similarly covered with the
chloride, and that if both be washed with one and the same solution of nitrate
there is no Comparison in respect of this valuable quality, the iodide being far
superior, and, of course, to be adopted in preference for the use of the camera.
It is, however, more difficult to fix, the action of the hyposulphites on this com-
pound of silver being comparatively slow and feeble.
HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 191

When the glass is coated with the bromide of silver, the action per se, is very
slow, and the discoloration ultimately produced far short of blackness; but
when moistened with nitrate of silver, sp. gr. 1°1, it is still more rapid than
with the iodide, turning quite black in the course of a very few seconds’ ex-
posure to sunshine. Plates of glass thus coated may be easily preserved for
the use of the camera, and have the advantage of being ready at a moment’s
notice, requiring nothing but a wash over with the nitrate of silver, which may
be delayed until the image is actually thrown on the plate and adjusted to the
correct focus with all deliberation. The sensitive wash being then applied
with a soft, flat camel’s-hair brush, the box may be closed and the picture im-
pressed; after which it only requires to be thrown into water and dried in the
dark to be rendered comparatively insensible, and may be finally fixed with
hyposulphite of soda, which must be applied hot, its solvent power on the
bromide being even less than on the iodide.

Sir John Herschel suggested a trial of the fluoride of silver upon
glass, which, he says, if proved to be decomposable by light, might
possibly effect an etching on the glass by the corroding property of
the hydrofluoric acid.

The metallic fluorides have been found to be decomposable, and a
very sensitive process on paper, called the fluorotype, will be de-
scribed in the chapter on Miscellaneous Processes. I am not aware
that any experiments have been made directly upon glass, but it is
certainly worthy of a careful trial.

Herschel has remarked that we can not allow the wash of nitrate
to dry upon the coating of the chloride or iodide of silver. If,.
however, we dip a glass which has one film of chloride upon it into
a solution of common salt, and then spread upon it some nitrate of
silver, we may very materially thicken the coating, and thus produce
more intense effects. Mr. Towson employed glass plates prepared
in this manner with much success. The mode adopted by that
gentleman was to have a box the exact size of the glass plate, in the
bottom of which was a small hole; the glass was placed over the bot-
tom, and the mixed solution, just strong enough to be milky, of the
salt and silver poured in. As the fluid finds its way slowly around the
edges of the glass, it filters out; the peculiar surface action of the
solid glass plate, probably a modified form of cohesive force, sepa-
‘ating the fine precipitate which is left behind on the surface of
the plate. By this means the operation of coating the glass is much
quickened. Another method by which films of any of the salts of sil-
ver can be produced upon glass plates, is the following modification of
the patent processes of Drayton and of Thompson for silvering glass:
Take a very clear plate of glass, and having put around it an edging
of wax about half an inch in depth, pour into it a solution of nitrate
of silver made alkaline by a few drops of ammonia, taking care that
no oxide of silver is precipitated; mix with this a small quantity of
spirits of wine, and then add a mixture of the oils of lavender and
cassia, or, which is perhaps the best process, a solution of grape sugar.
192 HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

In a short time the glass will be covered with a very beautiful metallic
coating. The solution is now poured off, the edging of wax removed,
and the silver is exposed to the action of diluted chlorine, or to the
vapor of iodine or bromide, until it is converted into a compound
of one of these elements, after which we may proceed as recommended
by Sir John Herschel.

ALBUMEN.

In the Technologiste for 1848, M. Niepce de Saint-Victor published
his mode of applying albumen to glass plates. M. Blanquart Ever-
ard followed, and successively albumen, gelatine, and serum were
employed. Messrs. Ross and Thomson, of Edinburgh, have been
eminently suecessful operators with albumen on glass plates, many
of their pictures leaving little to be desired. The manipulatory
details of the albumen process will be found in the technical division
of this work. .

COLLODION.

The successful application of a solution of gun cotton in ether,
to form the film for receiving the sensitive surface on glass, has been
claimed respectively by Mr. Fry and Mr. Archer. There is some
difficulty in fixing precisely this point, since there was no actual
publication of the process until long after it was generally in use.
Mr. Fry certainly introduced the use of gutta-percha in combination
with collodion.
THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND

By GARDNER F. WILLIAMS, Kimberley, South Africa.

Chemically the diamond is composed of the element carbon in its
pure crystallized state. The diamond crystallizes in the isometric
system and the most common forms are the octahedron and dode-
eahedron, while the (24-sided) tetrahexahedron is not uncommon.
Cube diamonds with beveled edges, representing the combination
o 0 © and » 02 are occasionally found in the Bultfontein and
Wesselton mines at Kimberley, South Africa. The diamonds from
various mines have distinctive forms of crystallization, or varia-
tions of the same forms, so characteristic that those familiar with
South African diamond mines and their products can determine
positively from which mine any given parcel of diamonds has been
obtained. It is not always possible to determine the source of each
individual diamond, for similar stones are occasionally found in
different mines; but these are exceptions to the rule. There is a dif-
ference in the luster, shape, or crystalline form of the diamonds
from the various mines that gives each mine some distinctive char-
acteristic. In one mine nearly all the crystals are sharp-edged octa-
hedrons, while in another dodecahedrons with rounded faces pre-
dominate. One might give no end of peculiarities of the diamonds
from the various mines, but it will suffice for the purposes of this
paper to state the fact that such distinctive characteristics do occur.

From this observation it may be concluded that the diamonds in
the mines of the Kimberley district, which occupies a small area
(see fig. 1), did not have a common origin.

The diamond is the most impenetrable of all known substances
and will scratch any other stone or the hardest steel. During his

170 tons to the square inch. It is a very strong reflector of light and
refracts incident rays more than any other substance except crocoite.¢

«Table of indices of refraction in Dufrenoy’s Traité de Mineralogie.
THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND. 195

While crocoite is the only mineral that exceeds the dispersive power
of diamond to dissolve white light into rainbow tints, in its powers
of reflection, refraction, and dispersion taken together the diamond
is unmatched.“ It is highly phosphorescent, and even the blackest
diamond is transparent to the X ray. The diamond glows under the
influence of the B rays from radium. Diamonds when subjected to
the action of radium for several months assume a green color, but
cut stones when treated in this manner seem to lose part of their
brilliancy. It is insoluble in all acids, and can easily be burned and
converted into carbon dioxide. It volatilizes at a temperature of
about 3,600° C. and passes from the solid to the gaseous state without
hiquefying.

Sir William Crookes went through the process of producing dia-
monds before the eyes of his audience, but was only able to show them
the result of this experiment by reproducing a lantern slide of
microscopical diamonds which he had made in the same way pre-
viously, for it takes a fortnight to separate them from the iron and
other substances in which they are embedded. The scientific prin-
ciple upon which this experiment rests, according to Sir William
Crookes, is that molten iron absorbs carbon, and as iron increases in
volume as it passes from the liquid to the solid state, if the outer
crust of the iron is suddenly cooled and the center remains in a liquid
state, the enormous pressure caused by its expanding while cooling
affords the two factors necessary for the crystallization of a dia-
mond—heat and pressure.

Authorities differ somewhat as to the exact moment when molten
iron expands on cooling, but it is the generally accepted theory that
expansion takes place at.the moment of solidification. It is also a
well-known fact that shrinkage or contraction takes place as the
solidified metal cools. It is therefore possible to obtain enormous
pressure in the molten center of a casting by the contraction of the
outer shell which has been rapidly cooled and the expansion of the
inner mass just as it begins to solidify.

It is noteworthy that the diamond is a noneonductor of electricity,
while graphite and amorphous carbon, substances so closely allied to
it in chemical composition, are good electrical conductors. By the
application of friction the diamond can be positively electrified, but
it very soon loses its electricity. The diamond is easily cleaved in
planes parallel to the octahedral faces. Pieces may be easily broken
from the facets of a cut stone by striking it with a hard substance.

196 THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND.

So much, it may be claimed, is known about the physical properties
of the diamond, but how the diamond has been formed or crystallized
is a question still debated by scientists.

Upon the information at hand it may be assumed that all diamonds
found prior to the discovery of the Kimberley pipes or craters came
from alluvial deposits and had been washed down by the disintegra-
tion of the original matrix. Such was the character of the formation
in which the noted diamonds of India were found, which is described
as a layer of broken sandstene, quartz, jasper, flint, and granite,
interspersed with masses of calcareous conglomerate, the whole being
about 20 feet thick and covered with a few feet of black “ cotton soil.”
Here were the great mines of Gani-Coulour and Gani-Parteal, whence
came the Koh-i-nur (7938 carats), the Great Mogul (787.5 carats),
the Regent (410 carats), and many other historical stones.?

The India mines were noted more for the size and purity than for
the quantity of the gems they produced. There had been no consider-
able production of diamonds outside of the Deccan fields until the
discovery of diamonds in Brazil in the year 1728. Here, in the
province of Minas Geraes, rich beds were opened in an alluvial
deposit of clay, quartz pebbles, and sand, charged with iron oxide.?
In many places the diamond-bearing strata were buried under 30
feet or more of alluvial detritus. These deposits occurred along the
rivers, up the ravines to the ridges and plateaus, where conglomerate
beds were reached from which the deposits in the rivers had been
washed. The conglomerate was chiefly itacolumite, a micaceous
sandstone. The sandstone, being a fragmental sedimentary rock,
was not the original matrix of the diamond. Probably when the
sandstone was being formed the diamonds were washed down with
the detritus and became embedded in it.

Diamonds have also been found in alluvial deposits in Borneo;
New South Wales; British Guiana; in the gold deposits of the Ural
Mountains, Australia, and California; along the Vaal River in South
Africa; and in many other localities.

Before the discovery of the mines at Jagersfontein and Kimberley,
which occurred between August, 1870, and July, 1871, there is no
record that diamonds had been discovered in volcanic pipes or craters,
their occurrence having always been in alluvial or sedimentary
deposits.

A few years ago diamonds were found in the battery mortar of a
mill at Klerksdorp in the Transvaal which was crushing gold ore

from a conglomerate reef similar to the Witwatersrand reefs. It
had occurred to me that either the wash from a diamond-bearing pipe
had been mixed with the detritus when the conglomerate beds were
formed or that a diamond-bearing dike penetrated the conglomerate
strata and its contents were mined and sent to the mill along with
the gold ore. This remarkable occurrence of diamonds has been
explained to me by an old Kimberley miner who was on the ground
at the time the diamonds were found. :

In his opinion some of the top soil or wash was mined with the
gold-bearing conglomerate and the diamonds came from this alluvial
deposit. The finding of these diamonds in the battery mortar, as
above described, is well authenticated. The diamonds were of a
greenish color.

In November, 1902, the Premier mine near Pretoria, Transvaal,
was found. The surface area of the mine has 3,515 claims (a claim
being 31 by 31 feet); 1,285 of these had been worked to an average
depth of 38 feet at the end of 1905. This ground has proved to be of
exceptional richness and has yielded 1,821,609 carats from 2,824,579
loads of 1,600 pounds each. It was in this mine that the Cullinan
diamond, famous for being the largest diamond crystal known, was
found January 26, 1905. This stone is of excellent quality and
weighs 3,025? carats—9,586.5 grains (1.37 pounds).

During last year (1905) a piece of Brazilian boart or carbonado

weighing 3,078 carats was broken up and sold in London.
Coming now to the occurrence of diamonds at Kimberley, I may
preface my remarks by saying that my experience with the mines at
Kimberley dates back nearly twenty-two years, about nineteen of
which have been passed in the management of them.

The diamonds occur in a rock commonly known as * blue ground,”
filling the craters of extinct voleanoes. This rock was described by
Prof. Henry Carvill Lewis as a porphyritic voleanic peridotite of
basaltic structure 4, which he named “-kimberlite.” It must be desig-
nated as breccia. There is no doubt that the blue ground is of vol-
canic origin, and was forced up from below; it consists of olivine
with fragments of other rocks. I am of the opinion that the craters
were filled by aqueous rather than igneous agencies, possibly by
something in the nature of mud volcanoes.

Tt is a noteworthy fact that all the craters were filled just even with
the surface of the surrounding country. Would this have been the
case if the pipes were of igneous origin? TI think not.

It may be claimed that the surface of the country, as it existed
when the craters were filled with the diamond-bearing breccia, was

a@The Matrix of the Diamond, Henry Carvill Lewis, M. A., F. R. 8., at a meet-
ing of the British Association at Manchester, August and September, 1887.

198 THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND.

not the same as at present, but that it has been denuded or washed
away, or has been removed by glacial action. There is, however, not
the least possible evidence to bear out such a contention. If the
country rock and diamond-bearing ground had become decomposed
and been washed away, then diamonds would have been found in the
“wash ” or in ravines and water courses in the vicinity of the mines.
Such is not the case, and no diamonds have been found in alluvial
soil nearer than the Vaal River, about 20 miles distant, and these
diamonds are totally different in character from the ‘“ mine” stones.

The Kimberley mines lie in basins from which no water flows into
any stream, but runs into pans or vleis, where it evaporates or is used
for mining purposes.

In this connection it may be stated that Dutoitspan mine is situate
within a few hundred feet of Du Toit’s pan, a pond, which is fed by
smal] water courses during the rainy season. The bottom of the pan
was probably 30 feet lower than the edge of the mine, where the
yellow diamond-bearing ground joined the basalt, yet it is a signifi-
eant fact that no diamonds have been found in the pan.

Bultfontein mine is also quite as near this pan and hes at a con-
siderable elevation above it.

At Kimberley and De Beers mines the same conditions exist, but
the drainage from these mines is to the north into Diebel’s vlei, which
is 100 or more feet below the mines and nearly 4 miles distant there-
from. No diamonds have been found between the mines and the
vlei nor in the vlei itself, and I repeat that this is a significant fact.
By what laws of nature would it be possible to obliterate a large
section of these mines and leave no diamonds behind in these depres-
sions? In case the depressions have been made since the formation
of the pipes, would it not be reasonable to expect that the forces that
made them would have washed a portion of the diamond pipes into
them ?

I have given these facts at considerable length because my conten-
tion that these are the craters and not simply the necks of mud
voleanoes has been questioned. It is contended that the craters have
been washed away, but this is hardly borne out by local observations.
The tops of these craters are bell-shaped, as is the case of ordinary
volcanoes. I can not conceive how these craters could have been just
filled to the level of the surface of the surrounding country, except
that the material which filled them came up as mud highly charged
with gases which escaped in the air on nearing the surface and
allowed the mass of mud to subside- There must have been some
process to incorporate the shales, which he near the surface, so thor-
oughly with the eruptive mass.

Any denudation of the tops of these craters would have left behind
some trace, even more than a trace, some concentration of diamonds
THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND. 199

and the heavy minerals which are associated with them. In the
machines in use on the diamond fields we imitate nature in concen-
trating the heavy minerals. The light particles are washed away,
leaving the concentrates behind.

The Vaal River diamonds did not have their origin in the Kim-
berley mines. The occurrence of well rounded and at times polished
bowlders and small pieces of rock in these mines is proof that other
than igneous action was necessary to produce them.

Professor Bonney says that “ the idea that they have been rounded
by a sort of cup-and-ball game played by a voleano may be dismissed
as practically impossible.”* He refers to the Dwyka conglomerate
bed as a possible source of these bowlders. A conglomerate bed’ com-
posed of fragments of quartz, feldspar, chert, shale, quartzite, quartz
porphyry, and other rocks exists in the Kimberley strata between the
shale and the melaphyre (or olivine-diabase of Stelzner), and is
between 300 and 400 feet below the surface. This conglomerate is
from 3 to 10 feet thick, as determined in the various shafts in the
Kimberley mines. The rounded stones in the mines did not come
from this bed, and are wholly unlike the stones in the conglomerate.
Personally I do not favor the cup-and-ball theory, and would not
give it a second thought were it not for the fact that the diamond-
bearing ground as it is found in the mines shows such a mixture with
the country rock (shale) that some process of nature must have
stirred up and thoroughly mixed the contents of these great craters.
I can not comprehend how this result could have been brought about
in an igneous voleano. There would have been overflows of the
diamond-bearing rock which would have been found in the vicinity
of the mines. No such deposits have been found, and I do not be-
heve that they exist.

It is much easier to reconcile existing conditions to the aqueous
cr mud-volcano theory (especially if the mud was accompanied by
large quantities of gases which, on nearing the surface, escaped while
the mud receded) than to an igneous theory.

There must have been innumerable eruptions and explosions to
account for the inclusion of the surface shales and fragments of the
country rock in the diamond-bearing peridotite. The frequent occur-
rence of these eruptions would, in a measure, solve the problem as to
the manner in which the fragments of rocks varying in size from
pebbles to bowlders, some with polished surfaces, became, as it were,
waterworn.

The evidence of the movement of the diamond-bearing rock after
solidifying is indicated by the slickensides and striated surfaces of
the country rocks at their junctions or contacts with the kimberlite.

200 THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND.

Large sheets of calcite are frequently found at the junction of these
rocks, which have taken the form of the striz. Beautiful calcite
erystals and transparent pieces of doubly refracting, or Iceland spar,
are of frequent occurrence.

There is conclusive proof that the diamonds in the South African
mines are not found in their original place of crystallization, as is
shown by the frequent occurrence of broken crystals embedded in
the hard kimberlite. The geological strata of the rocks which sur-
round the diamond-bearing pipes of the Kimberley district are shown
in figure 2.

Concerning the discussion of the genesis of the diamond, Sir Isaac
Newton’s opinion was that it was of vegetable origin and combusti-
ble; but it was not until 1694 that the combustibility of the diamond
was actually proved by the famous burning-glass experiment of
the academicians of Cimento.

Lavoisier, Guyton de Morveau, and others determined that the
diamond was converted into carbonic dioxide by burning. The
experiments of Sir Humphry Davy, in 1816, showed that the dia-
mond was almost pure carbon. These experiments have been con-
firmed by Dumas, Stas, Friedel, Roscoe, and other eminent chemists,
who have fixed with extreme precision the composition of the dia-
mond to be pure carbon in crystalline form. The late Dr. W. Guybon
Atherstone was one of the first scientists to deal with the occurrence
and genesis of the diamond in the Kimberley mines. Being a resi-
dent of the Cape Colony, he made frequent visits to the diamond
fields and made personal investigations."

“For a substance to crystallize,” he says, ‘its molecules must be
free to move. * * * The diamond, we know, is neither soluble
nor fusible. It is the element carben crystallized, and is consumed by
heat. How, then, could it survive as a crystal in the center of a vol-
ano? The key to solve this mystery was placed in my hands over
half a century ago by one of the greatest philosophers of the age,
whose lectures I had the privilege of attending. “ * * ‘ Hold out
your hand,’ said Faraday, at the close of the lecture that fairly elec-
trified the world of science, as with a loud hiss a snowy substance,
burning like a coal, but in reality intensely cold, escaped into the
palm of my hand from the strong iron vessel, in which, with a pres-
sure of fifty atmospheres, he had liquified carbonic acid gas—the very
gas resulting from the combustion of the diamond. * * * In the

ro

pressure in the subaqueous volcano, we have the constituents of the
diamond in a form admitting of crystallization and the subsequent
absorption of its oxygen by the iron always present in its containing
walls during long intermittent periods of volcanic inactivity.”

In this presentation Doctor Atherstone dogmatically puts the car-
bonic acid gas evolved from the carbonaceous shales into the cavities
of the amygdaloid (presumably the melaphyre, which is the only one
of the ineasing rocks of the voleanic pipes that is amygdaloidal).
This gas is then reduced by pressure to a liquid state, in which form,
as he thought, the carbon admitted of crystallization. He then ab-
sorbed the oxygen of the carbonic acid by the iron in the containing
walls of the craters. As the melaphyre existed before the volcanoes
burst through it, it is more than probable that the cavities, which ex-
isted in it at the time it was erupted, were filled with agate and cal-
cite, which they now contain, before the diamond-bearing ground
was forced up through it. If the theory above given had any foun-
dation in fact, one of two results must have happened, viz, either the
resultant diamonds would have been inclosed in the amygdaloidal
rock or the diamonds must be formed in the “ blue ” in their perfect
state. Both of these assumptions are contrary to facts. As to the
derivation of the necessary carbon from the carbonaceous shales sur-
rounding the mines, it will be made clear subsequently that this as-
sumption is not justified.

Professor Lewis alleged that the diamond is the result of the in-
trusion of igneous rocks into and through the carbonaceous shales.

He says: 2

Perhaps the most interesting chemical observation concerning the blue ground
was that made by Sir H. E. Roscoe. He found that on treating it with hot
water an aromatic hydrocarbon could be extracted. By digesting the blue
ground with ether and allowing the solution to evaporate, this hydrocarbon was
separated and found to be crystalline, strongly aromatic, volatile, burning with
a smoky flame and melting at 50° C.

That the rock was a true lava and not a mud or ash is indicated by the fact
that the minerals and their associations are those characteristic of eruptive ultra-
basic rocks.

Professor Lewis further says:

The kimberlite is shared by no other terrestrial rock. In structure it re-
sembles meteorites of similar composition. If the groundmass of kimberlite
were replaced by native iron, it would be nearly allied in both structure and
composition with meteorites known as chondrites.

The “Ava” meteorite, which fell in Hungary in 1846, contained
graphite in cubic crystalline form which Gustav Rose thought was
produced by the transformation of diamonds. Later Weinschenk
found transparent crystals (diamonds) in the Ava meteorite. Mj-

THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND. 203

nute diamond crystals and graphite have been found in the meteor-
ites from Canon Diablo, Arizona.

Professor Lewis advanced the theory that probably the diamonds
came from the hydrocarbon which was contained in the fragments of
carbonaceous shales distributed through the blue ground, but the in-
clusion of carbonaceous shales in the blue ground can hardly be ree-
onciled with Professor Lewis’s conclusion “ that the rock was a true
lava.”

If the diamond is the result of the intrusion of igneous rocks into
and through the carbonaceous shales, why do not all pipes composed
of kimberlite contain diamonds? And why do diamonds exist in
some mines, such as those in the Pretoria district, where no carbona-
ceous shales are to be found ?

Professor Molengraatf, formerly state mineralogist to the South
African Republic, discusses“ the genesis of the diamond, and says
that the theory of the formation of diamonds during the ascension of
the blue ground from carbon borrowed from the carbonaceous shales
was, in his opinion, weak.

In the Pretorian beds, as well as in the formations underlying these, strata
containing any notable quantities of carbon were nowhere to be found in the
Transvaal; so that the conclusion might safely be drawn that the igneous blue
ground, in forcing its way from great depths toward the place where it was
found, could not*borrow any carbon from the surrounding strata in order to con-
vert it into diamonds.

In Bohemia a rock occurs which contains every mineral known in
the blue ground of Kimberley except diamonds. On my visit to the
Mining Academy at Freiberg, Saxony, a few years ago, Doctor Stelz-
ner, professor of geology, showed me two cases containing these min-
erals, and in every instance the Bohemian minerals corresponded
with those from Kimberley, except that the case of Kimberley min-
erals contained a few small diamonds which I had presented to the
academy.

Both the aqueous and igneous theories of the origin of the kim-
berlite have had able supporters, among those of the former being
Stanislas Meunier,” M. Chaper,’ and later Professor Garnier and Sir
William Crookes.‘ The igneous theory is strongly supported by

Professors Lewis,? Molengraaff,’ and Stelzner.©. My own opinion is
that the aqueous theory is the less assailable.

Concerning the origin of the blue ground, assuming that it is not
the original matrix of the diamond, I find the following weak points
in the igneous theory :

1. As already observed, it is impossible to account by the igneous
theory for the water-worn bowlders found in the blue ground.

2. The experiments of Herr W. Luzi,’ of Leipsic, in the produc-
tion of artificial figures of corrosion upon the surfaces of rough dia-
monds, are most interesting in the light which they throw on the
erystallization and the probable matrix and genesis of the diamond.
Until lately the only appearance of corrosion upon the surface of
rough diamonds was the regular, triangular, negative pyramids
which were produced through heating the diamond in the open air
or under the oxygen flame.

Herr Luzi diseovered that the breccia (kimberlite) from the South
African mines when in a molten condition possesses the property of
absorbing the diamond or of changing its shape.

The following is a translation of the description of his experiment :

A small quantity of blue ground was melted in a crucible placed in a Four-
quinon-Leclerg furnace at a temperature of 1,770°, which was the highest tem-
perature attainabie. A diamond with perfectly smooth natural faces was sub-
merged in this molten mass. <A further quantity of blue ground was added to
the contents of the crucible until it was completely filled. <A tightly fitting
cover was placed on the crucible, which was again exposed for thirty minutes
to the greatest heat attainable. When the crucible was cooled the diamond was
removed and found to be covered with irregular oval and half-round grooves of
various depths. In one experiment the diamond was found to be deeply eaten
away on one side.

Some of these partly absorbed diamonds upon which Herr Luzi
experimented are deposited in the mineralogical museum of the
Leipsic University.

Owing to the cost of the material to be experimented upon, how-
ever, Herr Luzi was unable to determine positively what chemical
action took place during the time the diamonds were heated in the
complicated silica-flux. The fact that diamonds can be absorbed
by being placed in molten blue ground tends to prove that the blue
ground was not thrust up through the earth’s crust in a molten state.

Tf the diamond is unable to withstand the corroding influence of

the silica-magma at the comparatively low temperature given above,
how could it possibly have retained its forms of crystallization and
perfect faces at the far higher temperature and pressure which must
have existed under the igneous theory ¢

It seems a pity that Herr Luzi did not state the exact weight of the
diamonds upon which he experimented, both before and after his
experiments. The burning or absorption of the diamond in its
matrix is a strong argument against the contention that the blue
ground was once a molten lava. If a diamond placed in a graphite
crucible containing melted blue ground, which is subjected to a tem-
perature of only 1,770° R., changes its shape, could diamonds be
found perfect in shape, without a flaw, and with clear transparent
faces, so smooth that they have the appearance of having been pol-
ished @

3. Some years ago a diamond weighing 28.5 carats, found at Kim-
berley, attracted the attention of the valuator. Its external surface
was smooth and crystallized, showing no other mineral except the
diamond itself, but the interior was white and not transparent.
Noticing this peculiar appearance, the valuator broke the stone in
order to satisfy his curiosity and found that a small perfect octa-
hedral diamond was inclosed in the center of the larger stone. Nor
was this all. There were flakes of a white mineral, not diamond,
attached to the fragments of the broken diamond. In appearance
the flakes were white, translucent, and crystalline, and about as hard
as steel. When heated in a closed tube, moisture was given off. It
fused readily on platinum wire to a white bead. A few grains of
this white mineral were collected, and by analysis it proved to be
apophyllite, a silicate of lime and potash with 16 per cent of water.

If a mineral which is fusible at the ordinary temperature obtained
with a blowpipe, and which contains 16 per cent of water, was formed
at the same time that the diamond crystallized, it is certain that this
did not take place under an enormously high temperature. How,
then, one may ask, did the apophyllite become a part of this diamond 4

Herr von Tschudit describes a beautiful erystallized Brazilian
diamond in the center of which was a leaf of gold. He obtained the
information from Dr. Mills Franco, who claimed that there was no
doubt or deception as to the identification of the gold.

Occurrences of this nature tend to veil in additional mystery the
genesis of the diamond.

4. Professor T. G. Bonney” obtained from the Newlands mines,
40 miles northwest of Kimberley, specimens of a coarsely crystal-
line rock studded with garnets, technically called holocrystalline

and allied to eclogites. At a meeting of the Royal Society « he pre-
sented his conclusions:

The blue ground is not the birthplace either of the diamond or of the gar-
pets, pyroxenes, Olivine, and other minerals, more or less fragmental, which it
incorporates. The diamond is a constituent of the eclogite, just as much as a
zircon may be a constituent of a granite or a syenite. * * * [ had always
expected a peridotite (as supposed by Professor Lewis), if not a material yet
more basic, would prove to be the birthplace of the diamond.

Can it possibly be a derivative mineral, even in the eclogite? Had it crys-
tallized out of a more basic magma, which, however, was still molten when one
acid more was injected and the mixture became such as to form eclogite?
But I content myself with indicating a difficulty and suggesting a possibility ;
the fact itself is indisputable that the diamond occurs, though rather sporadic-
ally, as a constituent of an eclogite, which rock, according to the ordinary rules
of inference, would be regarded as its birthplace.

Professor Bonney’s statement that diamonds occur in the eclogite
of the Newlands mine caused me to examine the eclogite which is
found in all the mines at Kimberley and has always been treated as
waste rock and thrown away. There are tons of it lying about the
Kimberley mines. I have examined hundreds of pieces of this rock,
but never found a diamond, nor have I ever heard of a diamond
being found in it by anyone during the many years that these fields
have been worked. I caused about 20 tons to be collected and sent
to a test plant, where it was crushed and afterwards jigged, but it
contained no diamonds. Surely if one could find diamonds in the
eclogites of a poor mine like the Newlands, the total diamond yield
of which was only a few hundred carats, one would naturally expect
to find them in the eclogites from mines in the vicinity of Kimberley,
which are so rich.

Mr. Waldemar Lindgren, who is connected with the United States
Geological Survey, has had an opportunity of studying the blue
ground and the minerals contained therein from samples supplied by
the writer from which 45 slides were made. His conclusions are as
follows:

In looking over the literature [on diamonds], especially the papers by Profs.
A. W. Stelzner and T. G. Bonney, it seems to me that the connection of the
diamond with the garnet in the peridotite and pyroxenite has been satisfactorily
proved. It is not possible to regard it as formed in the “blue ground.” On the
contrary, it was evidently contained in the peridotite magma and crystallized
with it.

A specimen of the rock, which I presume to be similar to the
eclogite spoken of by Professor Bonney, taken from Dutoitspan mine,
was handed to Dr. G. F. Becker, who had a slide made from it. He
determined the rock to be lherzolite, and says:

a Proceedings of the Royal Society, Vol. LXV, July 27, 1899.
THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND. 207

This composition shows that the rock is extremely analogous to kimberlite;
in fact, probably a subvariety of it. Zirkel considers kimberlite as closely allied
to lherzolite, while Rosenbush appears uncertain how to classify it.

Doctor Becker is still of the opinion that diamonds ought to be
found in the lherzolite in spite of the result of the test of 20 tons.

(Quite a number of specimens of diamonds and garnets cemented
together have been found, but in most specimens which have come
under my observation the diamond has grown into the garnet. A
diamond was found (January 9, 1904) in Wesselton mine, Kimberley,
which had a small garnet embedded in it. The diamond weighed
114 carats, and the garnet was estimated to weigh about half a carat.
It appeared to fill the hole in which it was embedded. The diamond
was of cubic crystallization with nearly half of the cube wanting.
The part of the diamond in which the garnet was buried had numer-
ous depressions similar to the one containing the garnet, and one
is led to think that these depressions were also once filled with small
garnets, or, in other words, the diamond crystallized upon a nest of
garnets. It was of a peculiar plumbago color and semitransparent.
All of the diamonds crystallized in cubic form which have been
found of late in Wesseltonsmine were of this peculiar color. Speci-
mens have also been found where the diamond was embedded in
olivine.

5.. Sir William Crookes and others have mentioned diamonds which
burst or explode on being brought to the surface; and Sir William
says 1t has been * conclusively proved that the diamond’s genesis
must have taken place at great depths under enormous pressure. The
explosion of large diamonds on coming to the surface shows extreme
tension.”

Professor Lewis says that Kimberley diamonds have been found
sometimes to have optical anomalies due to strain. Fizzan thought
this strain to have been caused by the unequal distribution of heat
during cooling; but Jannettaz® holds that the strain is due to com-
pressed gas in the interior of the crystal.

I have found that the hght-brown smoky diamonds frequently
erack when brought from the mine to the surface; but even these
remain intact if kept in a moist place. In the days of open-cut work-
ing, when a smoky or hght-brown diamond was found, the digger
placed it in his mouth, where he kept it until he offered it for sale.
The buyer placed it in a raw potato, in which it was shipped to
Europe. The temperature of the ground in which the stone was
found would, as a rule, not exceed 70° F. The temperature of the
diamond would be raised to 98° F. while in the digger’s mouth. If,
however, the stone was kept in a dry place, even at a lower tempera-

4 Bulletin de la Société Minerale de France, II, 1879, p. 124.
208 THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND.

ture, it would crack in all directions. One might argue from this
that it was not the expansion of gases by heat alone which caused
the fractures. If these fractures were due to compressed gas, as con-
tended by Jannettaz, one might expect this cracking to have occurred
while the diamond and its contained gas were exposed to the enor-
mous heat to which, according to the igneous theory, diamonds must
have been subjected.

I had been led to belheve that only hght-brown or smoky stones
crack on being exposed to dry air, but I have lately been informed
by one of the old diamond miners that he had seen white stones which
showed the same phenomenon. There are innumerable fragments of
diamonds in the Kimberley pipes, and it is a question how the orig-
inal crystals became fractured.

6. Sir William Crookes says that the ash left after burning a dia-
mond invariably contains iron as its chief constituent, and the most
common colors of diamonds, when most perfectly pellucid, show
various shades of brown and yellow from the palest * offcolor ” to
almost black. These variations, he declares, accord with the theory
that the diamond has separated from molten iron.

I have made exhaustive tests in order to ascertain whether dia-
monds contain iron, oxidized or metallic. The experiments were
made with a magnetic separating machine, the field magnets of
which attracted any mineral containing iron or iron oxides except
pyrites. Although some of these diamonds had the appearance
of being coated with iron, and others were colored dark brown and
deep yellow, they were in no way attracted by the magnet, even when
excited by a strong electric current. These experiments do not, per-
haps, disprove the existence of iron in the diamond, but they do
establish the fact that the quantity is infinitesimally small. Further
experiments in this direction ought to be made by those who have
better facilities for such work than are at our disposal here in Kim-
berley. The experiments of Messrs. Hannay, Moissan, Friedel, Sir
Wilham Crookes, and others all show that microscopic diamonds can
be produced artificially; but they throw very little hght upon the
question how the diamonds in the South African craters crystallized.

From what is known of the theory of crystallization, one is
inclined to the old Indian idea that diamonds grow like onions,
though much less quickly. It is hardly conceivable that diamonds,
such as the Koh-i-nur, the Great Mogul, the Excelsior (a Jagers-
fontein South African stone of 971 carats), the two largest De Beers
diamonds (respectively of 503 and 428.5 carats), and the Cullinan
from the Premier mine (3,025% carats), were formed, as the micro-
scopic diamonds have been, in a moment of time during the sudden
cooling of molten iron.
THE GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND. 209

Is it not more reasonable to suppose that these enormous crystals
grew little by little, and that nature-has followed the same laws of
erystallization in the diamond as in other minerals?

In March, 1904, a diamond of 228 carats was found in the Kimber-
ley mine, which contained two red spots in the center of the stone.
One of these was bright red, and, under a magitfying glass, was
found to be a small diamond with crystalline faces easily distin-
g@ushable. The large diamond was cracked in all directions around
the small crystal for a distance of about one-sixteenth of an inch.

I have been frequently asked “ What is your theory of the original
crystallization of the diamond?” and the answer has always been
“ T have none, for after nineteen years of thoughtful study, coupled
with practical research, I find that it is easier to ‘ drive a coach and
four’ through most theories that have been propounded than to sug-
gest one which would be based on any nonassailable data.” All that
can be said is that in some unknown manner carbon, which existed
deep down in the internal regions of the earth, was changed from its
black and uninviting appearance to the most beautiful gem which
ever saw the light of day.

THE CULLINAN DIAMOND—A DESCRIPTION OF THE
BIG DIAMOND RECENTLY FOUND IN THE PREMIER
MINE, TRANSVAAL

By F. H. Harcu, Ph. D:, F. G. S., and G. S: CorstorPHINE, Ph. D., F. G. 8S.

Great interest has been excited, not only in the Transvaal, but
throughout the world, by the discovery at the Premier mine, on Wed-
nesday, the 25th of January, 1905, of the largest diamond hitherto
known. The stone was found by Mr. Wells, surface manager, in the
yellow ground about 18 feet from the surface, a brilliant flash of hght
from a projecting corner having caught his attention. After a pre-
liminary cleaning it weighs 3,024} carats. According to Gardner
Williams the South African carat is equivalent to 3°174 grains; con-
sequently the diamond weighs 9,600:5 grains troy, or 1°37 pounds
avoirdupois. Through the courtesy of the directors of the company,
we have been enabled to make an examination of the stone, with the
following result: Roughly speaking, it measures 4 by 24 by 2 inches;
but its size and shape will be best realized by reference to the photo-
graphs reproduced on Plates I and II, which represent the diamond
from four different points of view and its actual size. These beauti-
ful photographs were taken by Mr. E. H. V. Melvill for the purposes
of this description. The stone is bounded by eight surfaces, four of
which are faces of the original crystal, and will be referred to in this
description under the letters A, B, C, D, and four are cleavage sur-
faces, the cleavage being of course parallel to the face of the octahe-
dron. In the following description these cleavage surfaces are re-
ferred to under the letters E, F, G, H. They are distinguished from
the original octahedral faces by greater regularity and smoothness.
The shape and relative position of these various surfaces can be seen
in the diagrammatic projection depicted in the text figure, which
has been drawn in the mineralogical laboratory of the Oxford Uni-
versity Museum, by the kind permission of Professor Miers, F. R. 5.

DESCRIPTION OF THE SURFACES.

A is an original octahedral face showing typical striations, the
bands varying from 0:1 to 0-4 centimeter, and running parallel to the
edge AE.

B is a large surface slightly curved showing partial striations,
which, however, are interrupted by the shghtly mammillary character
of the surface.

C is also a natural surface showing a few striations parallel to the
edge CE.

D. Between B and F, C, G there is an irregular octahedral face,
D, showing distinct equilateral triangular indentations which resem-
ble etched figures, except in regard to their
comparatively large size, the largest having a
side measuring 0°7 centimeter. D is parallel
to E.

EK, F, G, H are cleavage planes.

K is the largest of these, and is a very per-
‘ect cleavage plane. Parallel to it within the
crystal there is a small air layer between two
internal cleavages, producing a “ rainbow,” or
Newton’s rings.

F is the second largest of the cleavage
planes and shows a small spot within the
crystal.

Diagraamatie projection (to G is an irregularly shaped cleavage plane.

BESSON) His another cleavage face showing series
of cleavages in the corner bounded by E and G. Two spots are
visible, one actually on the surface, the other about 1 centimeter
within the crystal.

Of the faces given, A-and G, H and B, and E and D are parallel.
In the case of B and H the parallelism is imperfect owing to the
curvature of B.

The purity of the crystal is best seen on looking into face E, and
the luster is well seen on the irregular natural face B, the broken
cleavage on H causing a good deal of refraction, which affects B to
some extent as the facets of a cut gem would. For a large stone
the crystal is of remarkable purity, and the color approximates to
that of a blue-white.

The large size of the cleavage planes E and F indicates that a
very considerable portion of the crystal is wanting. From the shape
of B, D, and G, one can say that the entire crystal was irregular in
shape, but A and D being octahedral faces, the presumption is that
the complete crystal was a distorted octahedron, probably with dodec-
ahedral faces developed on the edges. The portions missing prob-
ably amount to more than half of the original crystal.

The Cullinan diamond, as it has been named, after the chairman
of the Premier company, is more than three times the weight of
the largest diamond previously known—the famous stone found in
1893 at Jagersfontein, in the Orange River Colony, which weighed
972 carats.

In scanning the list of the elements with which we are thoughtfully
supphed every year by the international committee on atomic
weights, the direction in which our thoughts are led will depend on
the particular aspect of chemical study which happens to interest
us at the time. Putting from our minds on the present occasion the
attractive speculations on atomic constitution and disintegration with
which we have all become at least superficially familiar during the
past few years, let us try to scan this list from the point of view of the
* plain man” rather than from that of the expert chemist. [ven
a rudimentary knowledge will be sufficient to enable our * plain
man” to divide the elements broadly into two groups—the actually
useful and the doubtfully useful or useless. Without going into
detail we may take it that about two-thirds would be admitted into
the first group and one-third into the second. It must, I think, be
regarded as a very remarkable fact that of the 80 elements which
have had the intrinsic stability to enable them to survive the prodi-
gious forces which must have been concerned in the evolution of the
physical universe, so large a proportion are endowed with char-
acteristic properties which could ill have been spared either from the
laboratories of nature or from those of the arts and sciences. Even
if one-third of the elements are to be regarded as waste products or
failures, there is here no counterpart to the reckless prodigality of
nature in the processes of organic evolution.

If we exclude those elements which participate directly and indi-
rectly in the structure and functions of the organic world, there are

two elements which stand out conspicuously because of the supreme
influence they have exercised over the trend of human effort and
ambition. I refer, of course, to the metals gold and iron.

From the early beginnings of civilization gold has been highly
prized and eagerly sought after. Human life has been freely sacri-
ficed in its acquirement from natural sources, as well as in its forcible
seizure from those who already possessed it. The “Age of Gold”
was not necessarily the * Golden Age,” for the noble metal in its
unique and barbaric splendor has symbolized much that has been
unworthy in national and individual aims and ideals.

We have accustomed ourselves to think of the present as the Age of
Tron, as indeed it is, for we see in the dull, gray metal the plastic
medium out of which the engineer has modeled the machines and
structures which play so large a part in the active life of to-day.
Had iron not been at once plentiful and cheap, had it not brought
into the hands of the engineer and artificer its marvelous qualities
ef hardness and softness, of rigidity and toughness, and to the
electrician its mysterious and unique magnetic qualities, it 1s not
difficult to conceive that man’s control over the forces of nature
might have been delayed for centuries, or perhaps for ages. For
iron has been man’s chief material instrument in the conquest of
nature; without it the energy alike of the waterfall and of the coal
field would have remained uncontrolled and unused. In this con-
quest of the resources of nature for the service of man are we not
entitled to say that the intellectual and social gains have equaled,
if they have not exceeded, in value the purely material gains; and
may we not then regard iron as the symbol of a beneficent conquest of
nature ?

With the advent of the industrial age gold was destined to take
a new place in the world’s history as the great medium of exchange,
the great promoter of industry and commerce. While individual
gain still remained the propelling power toward its discovery and
acquisition, every fresh discovery led directly or indirectly to the
freer interchange of the products of industry, and thus reacted
favorably on the industrial and social conditions of the time.

So long as the chief supplies of gold were obtained from alluvial
deposits by the simple process of washing, the winning of gold almost
necessarily continued to be pursued by individuals, or by small groups
of workers, who were mainly attracted by the highly speculative
nature of the occupation. These workers endured the greatest hard-
ships and ran the most serious personal risks, drawn on from day to
day by the hope that some special stroke of good fortune would be
theirs. This condition prevailed also in fields in which the reef gold
occurred near the surface, where it was easily accessible without

costly mining appliances, and where the precious metal was loosely
associated with a weathered matrix. These free-milling ores could
be readily handled by crushing and amalgamation with mercury, so
that here also no elaborate organization and no great expenditure
of capital were necessary. <A third stage was reached when the more
easily worked deposits above the water line had been worked out.
Not only were more costly appliances and more elaborately organized
efforts required to bring the ore to the surface, but the ore when
obtained contained less of its gold in the easily recovered, and more
in the refractory or combined form. The problem of recovery had
now to be attacked by improved mechanical and chemical methods.
The sulphides or tellurides with which the gold was associated or
combined had to be reduced to a state of minute subdivision by more
perfect stamping or grinding, and elaborate precautions were neces-
sary to imsure metallic contact between the particles of gold and the
solvent mercury. In many cases the amalgamation process failed to
extract more than a very moderate proportion of the gold, and the
quartz sand or “ tailings ” which still contained the remainder found
its way into creeks and rivers or remained in heaps on the ground
around the batteries. In neighborhoods where fuel was available a
preliminary roasting of the ore was resorted to, to oxidize or volatilize
the baser metals and set free the gold; or the sulphides, tellurides, ete.,
were concentrated by washing, and the concentrates were taken to
smelting or chlorinating works in some favorable situation where the
more elaborate metallurgical methods could be economically applied.
Many efforts were also made to apply the solvent action of chlorine
directly to the unconcentrated unroasted ores; but unfortunately
chlorine is an excellent solvent for other substances besides gold, and
in practice it was found that its solvent energy was mainly exercised
on the base metals and metalloids and on the materials of which the
apparatus itself-was constructed.

This to the best of my knowledge is a correct, if rather sketchy,
description of the state of matters in 1889 when the use of a dilute
solution of cyanide of potassium was first seriously proposed for the
extraction of gold from its ores. Those of us who can recall the time
will remember that the proposal was far from favorably regarded
from a chemical point of view. The cost of the reagent; its extreniely
poisonous nature, the instability of its solutions, its slow action—
such were the difficulties that naturally presented themselves to our
minds. And, even granting that these difficulties might be overcome,
there still remained the serious problem of how to recover the gold in
ietallic form from the extremely dilute solutions of the cyanide of
gold and potassium. How each and all of these difficulties have been
swept aside, how within little more than a decade this method of

sm 1905 18

gold extraction has spread over the gold-producing countries of the
world, now absorbing and now replacing the older processes, but
ever carrying all before it—all this is already a twice-told tale which I
should feel hardly justified in alluding to were it not for the fact
that we are to-day meeting on the Rand where the infant process
made its début nearly fourteen years ago. The Rand to-day is the
richest of the world’s gold fields, not only in its present capacity, but
in its potentialities for the future; twenty years ago its wonderful
possibilities were quite unsuspected even by experts.

It is not for me to describe in detail how the change has been
accomplished; this task will, we know, be far better accomplished
by representative chemists who are now actively engaged in the work.
But for the chemists of the British Association it is a fact of great
significance that they are here in the presence of the most truly in-
dustrial development of gold production which the world has yet
seen—a development moreover that is founded on a purely chemical
process which for its continuance requires not only skilled chemists
to superintend its operation, but equally skilled chemists to supply
the reagent on which the industry depends.

In 1889 the world’s consumption of cyanide of potassium did
not exceed 50 tons per annum. ‘This was produced by melting
ferrocyanide with carbonate of potassium, the clear fused cyanide
so obtained being decanted from the carbide of iron which had
separated. The resulting salt was a mixture of cyanide, cyanate,
and carbonate, which was sometimes called cyanide of potas-
sium for the hardly sufficient reason that it contained 30 per cent of
that salt. When the demand for gold extraction arose, it was at first
entirely met by this process, the requisite ferrocyanide being ob-
tained by the old fusion process from the nitrogen of horns, leather,
ete. In 1891 the first successful process for the synthetic production
of cyanide without the intervention of ferrocyanide was perfected,
and the increasing demand from the gold mines was largely met by
its use. At present the entire consumption of cyanide is not much
short of 10,000 tons a year, of which the Transvaal gold field con-
sumes about one-third. Large cyanide works exist in Great Britain,
Germany, France, and America, so that a steady and sure supply of
the reagent has been amply provided. In 1894 the price of cyanide
in the Transvaal was 2 shillings per pound; to-day it is one-third of
that, or 8 pence. During the prevalence of the high prices.of earlier
vears the manufacture was a highly speculative one, and new proc-
esses appeared and disappeared with surprising suddenness, the dis-
appearance being generally marked by the simultaneous vanishing
of large sums of money. To-day the manufacture is entirely carried
out in large works scientifically organized and supervised, and, both

GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY. Pads)

industrially and commercially, the speculative element has been elim-
inated.

Chemistry has so often been called on to play the part of the hum-
ble and unrecognized handmaiden to the industrial arts that we may
perhaps be pardoned if in this case we call public attention to our
Cinderella as she shines in her rightful position as the genius of
industrial initiation and direction.

To this essentially chemical development of metallurgy we owe it
that in a community whose age can only be counted by decades we
find ourselves surrounded by chemists of high scientifie skill and
attainments who have already organized for their mutual aid and
scientific enhightenment “ The Johannesburg Society of Chemistry,
Metallurgy, and Mining,” whose published proceedings amply testify
to the atmosphere of intellectual vigor in which the work of this
great industry is carried on.

It appears, then, that while gold still maintains its position of influ-
ence in the affairs of men, the nature of that influence has undergone
an important change. Not only has its widespread use as the chief
medium of exchange exercised far-reaching effects on the commerce
of the world, but the vastly increased demand for this purpose has
in its turn altered the methods of production. These methods have
become more highly organized and scientific, and gold production
is now fairly established as a progressive industry, in which scope
1s found for the best chemical and engineering skill! and talent.

The experience of more highly evolved industries in the older
countries has shown that the truly scientific organization of industry
includes in its scope a full and just consideration for the social and
intellectual needs of its workers from highest to lowest. It augurs
well, therefore, for the future of the gold industry, from the humane
and social points of view, that its control should be more and more
under the influence of men of scientific spirit and intellectual culture,
who, we may feel assured, will not forget the best traditions of their
class.

The application of science to industry requires on the part of the
pioneers and organizers keen and persistent concentration on cer-
tain well-defined aims. Any wavering in these aims or any relaxa-
tion of this concentration may lead to failure or to only a qualified
success. This necessary but narrow concentration may be a danger
to the intellectual development of the worker, who may thereby readily
fall into a groove and so may become even less efficient in his own
particular work. It certainly requires some mental strength to hold
fast to the well-defined practical aim while allowing to the attention
occasional intervals of liberty to browse over the wide and pleasant
fields of science. But I am certain that the acquirement of this
220 GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY.

double power is well worth an effort. The mental stimulus, as well
as the new experiences garnered during the excursion, will sooner or
later react favorably on the practical problems, while the earnest
wrestling with these problems may develop powers and intuitions
which will lend their own charm to the wider problems of science.

GOLD AND SCIENCE.

If we reperuse the table of the elements, not now in our capacity
as “ plain men,” but as chemists, we shall certainly not select gold as
of supreme interest chemically. Its position as chief among the
noble metals, its patent of nobility, is based on its aloofness from
common associations or attachments. Unlike the element nitrogen,
it is mainly for itself and little, if at all, for its compounds, that gold
is Interesting. In it we can at our leisure study the metal rather than
the element. Its color and transparence, its softness and its hard-
ness, the density as well as the extreme tenuity of some of its forms—
such were the qualities which recommended it to Faraday when he
desired to study the action of material particles on light. I should
like to repeat to you in his own words the reasons he gave for this
choice :

Because of its comparative opacity among bodies and yet possession of a real
transparency ; because of its development of color both in the reflected and
transmitted rays; because of the state of tenuity and division which it permitted
with the preservation of its integrity as a metallic body ; because of its supposed
simplicity of character, and because known phenomena appeared to indicate
that a mere variation in the size of its particles gave rise to a variety of result-
ant colors. Tesides the waves of light are so large compared to the dimensions
of the particles of gold which in various conditions can be subjected to a ray,
that it seemed probable that the particles might come into effective relations to
the much smaller vibrations of the other particles.

I may remind you that Faraday came to the conclusion that the
variety in the colors presented by gold under various conditions 1s
due to the size of its particles and their state of aggregation. Ruby
glass or ruby solutions he proved are not true solutions, nor are
they molecular diffusions of gold, but they contain the metal in aggre-
gates sufticiently large to give a sensible reflection under an incident
beam of light. Through the kindness of Sir Henry Roscoe Iam
able to exhibit to you some of the original ruby-gold preparations
obtained during this research, which were afterwards presented to
him by Faraday at the Royal Institution some years before his death.

By means of refined and ingenious optical methods Zigsimondy and
Siedentopf have succeeded in making these ultramicroscopic particles
visible in the microscope as diffraction disks; they have, further,
counted the number of particles per unit area and have from the
intensity of their reflection calculated their size. In ruby glass
GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY. 221

the size of the particles in different specimens was found to vary
from 4 to 791 milhionths of a millimeter. No relation was found to
hold between the color of the particles and their absolute size. This
conclusion is in direct contradiction of Faraday’s belief, already
referred to. Mr. J. Maxwell Garnett has recently shown that the
color of metallic glasses and films is determined, not only by the
absolute size of the metal particles, but also by the proportion of the
total volume they occupy in the medium in which they are diffused.
The results of Mr. Garnett’s calculations are in close agreement with
a number of the observations on the color and microstructure of
thin metal films which I had already recorded, and they appear to
me to supply the explanation of much that had appeared puzzling
before. My own observations lead me to think that the actual micro-
scopic particles which are to be seen, and the larger of which can
also be measured, in films and solutions or suspensions, do not in any
way represent the ultimate units of structure which are required
by Mr. Garnett’s theory, but that these particles are aggregates of
smaller units built up in more or less open formation.

That a relatively opaque substance, like gold, may be so attenuated
that when disseminated in open formation it becomes transparent is
contrary to all our associations with the same operation when per-
formed on. transparent substances hke glass or crystalline salts.
The familiar experiment of crushing a transparent crystal into :
perfectly opaque powder would not prepare us for the effect of
minute subdivision on the transparence of metals. At first it
might be supposed that this difference is due to the very rough
and incomplete subdivision of the erystal by crushing; but this is
not the case, for the perfectly transparent oxide of magnesium may
be obtained in a state of attenuation comparable with that of the
gold by allowing the smoke from burning magnesium to deposit on
a glass plate. The film of oxide obtained in this way is found to
be built up of particles quite as minute as those of which the gold
films are composed, yet the opacity of the oxide film is relatively
much greater. The minute particles of the dielectric, magnesium
oxide, scatter and dissipate the hght waves by repeated reflection
and refraction, while the similar particles of the metallic conductor,
gold, act as electrical resonators which pass on some of the light
waves while reflecting others. Specimens of films of gold and silver
and of magnesium oxide are exhibited on the table and on the Jan-
tern screen. When the metallic particles are in this state of open
formation and relative transparence, it was found that the electrical
conductivity of the films had completely disappeared. Films of
this description were found to have a resistance of over 1,000,000
megohms as compared with only 6 ohms in the metallic reflecting
condition. .

MOLECULES IN THE SOLID STATE.

My examination of gold films and surfaces has revealed the fact
that during polishing the disturbed surface film behaves exactly
like a liquid under the influence of surface tension. At temperatures
far below the melting point molecular movement takes place under
mechanical disturbance, and the molecules tend to heap up in minute
mounds or flattened droplets. These minute mounds are often so
shallow that they can only be detected when the surface is illumi-
nated by an intense, obliquely incident beam of light. I have esti-
mated that these minute mounds or spicules can be seen in this way
in films which are not more than 5 to 10 micromillimeters in thick-
ness. A film of this attenuation may contain so few as ten to twenty
molecules in its thickness.

When moderately thin films of gold are supported on glass and
heated at a temperature of 400 to 500° they become translucent, and
the forms assumed under the influence of surface tension can be
readily seen by transmitted hght. It was in this way that the beau-
tiful but puzzling spicular appearance by obliquely reflected hght
was first explained as due to the granulation of the surface under
the influence of surface tension. Photo-micrographs of these films
are exhibited.

Turning now to the mechanical properties of metals, we find that
gold has proved itself of great value in the investigation of some of
these. It has long been recognized as the most malleable and ductile
of the metals, while its chemical indifference tends to preserve it in
a state of metallic purity throughout any prolonged series of opera-
tions.

The artificers in gold must very early have learned that its ‘mallea-
bility and ductility are not qualities which indefinitely survive the
operations of hammering and wire drawing. A piece of soft gold
beaten into a thin plate does not remain equally soft throughout the
process, but spreads with increasing difficulty under the hammer.
If carelessly beaten, it may even develop cracks round its edges.
We may assume that the artificers in gold very soon discovered that
by heating, the hardened metal might be restored to its former condi-
tion of softness.

In connection with the study of the micrometallurgy of iron and
steel during recent years it has been recognized that heat annealing
is as a rule associated with the growth and development of crystal-
line grains, and Professor Ewing and Mr. Rosenhain have shown
that overstrain is often, 1f not invariably, associated with the de-
formation of these crystalline grains by slips occurring along one
or more cleavage planes. This hypothesis, though well supported
up to a point by microscopic observations on a variety of metals,
offers no explanation of the natural arrest of malleability or duc-
GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY. 223

tility which occurs when the overstrain has reached a point at which
the crystalline grains are still, to all appearance, only slightly de-
formed. At this stage there is no obvious reason why the slipping
of the crystalline lamellae should not continue under the stresses
which have initiated it. But far from this being the case, a rela-
tively great increase of stress produces little or no further yielding
till the breaking point is reached and rupture takes place.

The study of the surface effects of polishing, already referred to,
had shown that the thin surface film -retained no trace of crystalline
structure, while it also gave the clearest indications that the metal
had passed through a quid condition before settling into the forms
prescribed by surface tension. From this it was argued that the
conditions which prevail at the outer surface might equally prevail
at all inner surfaces where movement had occurred, so that every
ship of one crystalline lamella over another would cause a thin film of
the metal to pass through the liquid phase to a new and noncrystal-
line condition. By observations on the effects of beating pure gold
foil it was found that the metal reached its hardest and least plas-
tic condition only when all outward traces of crystalline structure
had disappeared. It was also ascertained that this complete destruc-
tion of the crystalline lamelle and units could only be accomplshed
in the layers near the surface, for the hardened substance produced
by the flowing under the hammer appears to incase and protect the
crystalline units after they become broken down to a certain size.
By carefully etching the surface in stages by means of chlorine
water or cold aqua regia the successive layers below the surface
were disclosed. The surface itself was vitreous. Beneath this was
a layer of minute granules, and lower still the distorted and broken-
up remains of crystalline lamelle and grains were embedded in a
vitreous and granular matrix. The vitreous-looking surface layer
represents the final stage in the passage from soft to hard, from
crystalline to amorphous. By heating the beaten foil its softness
was restored, and on etching the annealed metal it was found that
the crystalline structure also was fully restored. Photomicrographs
showing these appearances are exhibited. These microscopic ob-
servations were fully confirmed by finding well-marked thermo-
electrical and electro-chemical distinctions between the two forms
of metal, the hard and soft or the amorphous and the crystalline.
The determination of a definite transition temperature at which the
amorphous metal passes into the crystalline metal further confirms
the phase view of hardening by overstrain and softening by an-
nealing.

It was subsequently proved that the property of passing from crys-
talline to amorphous by mechanical flow and from amorphous to
crystalline by heat at a definite transition temperature is a general
one which is possessed by all crystalline solids which do not decom-
2294 GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY.

pose at or below, their transition temperature. The significance of
this fact, I venture to think, entitles it to more than a passing refer-
ence. It appears to me to mean that the transition from amorphous
to crystalline is entitled to take its place with the other great changes
of state, solid to liquid, liquid to gas, for lke these, it marks a
change in the molecular activity which occurs when a certain tem-
perature is reached. It is entitled to take this place because there
is every indication that the change is as general in its nature as the
other changes of state. Compare it, for instance, with the allo-
tropic changes with which chemists have been familiar. These are
for the most part changes which are special to particular elements
or compounds and are usually classed with the chemical properties
by which the substances may be distinguished from each other.
Very different is the amorphous crystalline change, for although
in particular cases it may have been observed and associated with
allotropic changes, yet the causes of its occurrence are more deeply
founded in the relations between the molecules and the heat energy
by which their manifold properties are successively unfolded as tem-
perature is raised from the absolute zero. At this transition point
we find ourselves face to face with the first stirrings of a specific
directive force by which the blind cohesion of the molecules is
ordered and directed to the building up of the most perfect geo-
metric forms. It is hardly possible any longer to regard the stability
of a crystal as static and inert and independent of temperature.
Rather must its structure and symmetry be taken as the outward
manifestation of a dynamic equilibrium between the primitive co-
hesion and the kinetic energy imparted by heat. Even before the
discovery of a definite temperature of transition from the amorphous
to the crystalline phase we had in our hands the proofs that in cer-
tain cases the crystalline state can be a state of dynamic rather than
of static equilibrium. The transition of sulphur from the rhombic
to the prismatic form supplies an example of crystalline stability
which persists only between certain narrow limits of temperature.
Within these limits the crystal is a “living crystal,” 1f one may
borrow an analogy from the organic world. It can still grow, and
it will under proper conditions repair any damage it may receive.
The passage of the same substance through several crystalline
phases, each only stable over a limited range of temperature, strongly
supports the general conclusion drawn from the existence of a sta-
bility temperature between the amorphous and crystalline phases,
namely, that the crystalline arrangement of the molecules requires for
its active existence the particular kind or rate of vibration corre-
sponding with a certain range of temperature. Below this point the
crystal may become to all appearance a mere pseudomorph with no
powers of active growth or repair. But these powers are not ex-
tinct—they are only in abeyance ready to be called forth under the
GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY. DOR

energizing influence of heat. This temporary abeyance of the more
_ active properties of matter is strikingly illustrated by the early obser-
vations of Sir James Dewar at the boiling point of liquid air, and
more recently at that of liquid hydrogen. At the latter temperature
even chemical affinity becomes latent. In metals it was found that
the changes in their physical properties brought about by these low
temperatures are not permanent, but only persist so long as the low
temperature is maintained. During the past year Mr. R. A. Hadfield
has supplemented these earher results by making a very complete
series of observations on the effect of cooling on the mechanical prop-
erties of iron and its alloys. The tenacity and hardness of the pure
metal and its alloys at the ordinary tempmerature and at — 182° have
been compared, and it has been found that these qualities are invaria-
bly enhanced at the lower temperature, but that they return exactly to
their former value at the ordinary temperature. By the mere abstrac-
tion of heat between the temperatures of 18° and — 182° the tensile
strength of pure metals is raised 50 to 100 per cent. In pure iron the
icrease is from 23 tons per square inch at 18° C. to 52 tons at
— 182°; in gold from 15:1 tons to 22°4 tons; and in copper from 19° 5
tons to 26°4. This increase is not, I think, due to the closer approxi-
mation of the molecules, for the coefficient of expansion of most metals
below 0° is extremely small. Neither is it due to permanent changes
of molecular arrangement or aggregation, for Mr. Hadfield has
obtained a perfectly smooth and regular cooling curve for iron
between 18° and — 182°, and there appears to be no indication of the
existence of any critical point between these temperatures. Further,
the complete restoration of the original tenacity on the return to the
higher temperature shows that no permanent or irreversible change
has occurred during cooling. Everything therefore indicates that the
increase of tenacity which occurs degree by degree as heat is removed
is due to the reduction of the repulsive force of molecular vibration,
so that the primary cohesive force can assert itself more and more
completely as the absolute zero is approached.

The metals experimented with by Mr. Hadfield were all in the
annealed or crystalline condition, so that the molecules must have
exerted their mutual attractions along the directed axes proper to this
state. It is to be expected that similar experiments with the metals in
the amorphous state may throw hght on the question whether and to
what extent the crystalline state depends on a dynamic equilibrium
between the forces of cohesion and repulsion, or whether a directed
cohesion exists fully developed in the molecules at the absolute zero.?

a Since the above was written a series of observations has been made on the
influence of low temperature on the tenacity of pure metals in the amorphous
condition. These observations will form the subject of a separate communication
to the chemical section.
996 GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY.

The phenomena of the solid state throw an interesting hght on the
interplay of the two great forces, the primitive or blind cohesion
which holds undisputed sway at the absolute zero, and the repulsion
due to the molecular vibrations which is developed by heat. This
interplay we know continues through the states which succeed each
other as the temperature is raised, till a point 1s reached at which the
molecular repulsions so far outweigh the cohesive force that the sub-
stance behaves like a perfect gas. The problems of molecular consti-
tution are more likely to be elucidated by a study of the successive
states between the absolute zero and the vaporizing temperature than
at the upper ranges where the gaseous state alone prevails. The sim-
pheity of the laws which govern the physical behavior of a perfect
gas is very attractive, but we must not forget that this simplicity is
only possible because repulsion has so nearly overcome cohesion that
the latter may be practically ignored. The attractiveness of this sim-
plicity should not blind us to the fact that it is in the middle region,
where the opposing forces are more nearly equal, that the most inter-
esting and illuminating phenomena are hkely to abound. The appli-
‘ration of the gas laws to the phenomena of solution and osmosis
appears to be one of those cases in which an attractive appearance of
sunplicity in the apparent relations may prove very misleading.

Before passing from the specially metallic qualities of gold I will
only remind you of the important part it has played in the researches
on the diffusion of metals by the late Sir William Roberts-Austin,
and in those of Mr. Haycock and Mr. Neville on the freezing points of
solutions of gold in tin, which led to the recognition of the monatomic
nature of the molecules of metals.

MOLECULES IN SOLUTION.

It has occurred to me that the practice of the cyanide process of
vold extraction presents us with several new and interesting aspects
of the problems of solution. As you are aware, the gold is first
obtained from the ore in the form of a very dilute solution of cyanide
of gold and potassium, from which the metal has to be separated,
either by passing it through boxes filled with zine shavings or by
electrolysis in large cells.

The solution as it leaves the cyanide vats may contain gold equal to
100 grains or more per ton, and as it leaves the precipitating boxes it
may contain as little as 1 or 2 grains and as much as 20 grains.
In the treatment of slimes much larger volumes of solution have to be
dealt with, and in this case solutions containing 18 grains per ton
have been regularly passed through the precipitating boxes, their
gold content being reduced to 14 grains per ton. In round numbers
we may say that 1 gram of gold is recovered from 1 cubic meter of
solution, while 0° 1 gram is left in the solution. Even from the point
lend

of view of the physical vhemist we are here in presence of solutions of
a very remarkable order of dilution. A solution containing 1 gram
per cubic meter is in round numbers N/200,000, and the weaker solu-
tion containing 0° 1 gram is N/2,000,000. It is convenient to remember
that the latter contains a little more than 14 grains per ton. In exper-
iments on the properties of dilute solutions the extreme point of dilu-
tion was reached by Kohlrausch, who employed solutions containing
1/100,000 of a gram molecule of solute per liter for his conductivity
experiments. These solutions were therefore twice as strong as the
gold solution with 1 gram per cubic meter and 20 times as strong as
the more dilute solution. This fact must be my excuse for placing
before you the results of a few simple calculations as to the molecular
distribution in these solutions, which have certainly given me an
entirely new view of what constitutes a really dilute solution from the
molecular point of view.

In estimating the number of molecules in a given volume of solution
the method adopted is to divide the space into minute cubical cells,
each of which can exactly contain a sphere of the diameter of the
molecule. In this way a form of piling for the molecules is assumed
which, though not the closest possible, may quite probably represent
the piling of water molecules. ‘Taking the molecular diameter as
0°210—° millimeters—a figure which is possibly too small for the
water molecules and too large for the gold—it is found that a cubic
millimeter of solution contains 125 & 10'S molecules, or 125 quadril-
lions. The head of an ordinary pin, if it were spherical, would have
a volume of about 1 cubic millimeter.

If these water molecules could be arranged in a single row, each
molecule just touching its two nearest neighbors, the length of the
row would be 25,000,000 kilometers. A thread of these fairy beads,
which contained, the molecules of one very small drop of a volume of
6 cubic millimeters, would reach from the earth to the sun, a distance
of about 150,000,000 kilometers.

In a solution contaiming 14 grains of gold per ton, or 1 decigram
per cubic meter, the ratio of gold molecules to water molecules is as
1: 193,000,000. Each cubic millimeter of the solution, therefore, con-
tains 6,500,000,000 gold molecules. If these are uniformly distributed
throughout the solution each will be about 400 micromillimeters, or
1/60,000 of an inch, from its nearest neighbors. This is not really
very wide spacing, for the point of the finest sewing needle would
cover about 1,500 gold molecules.

If a cubic meter of solution could be spread out in a sheet one
molecule in thickness it would cover an area of 1,680 square miles,
and nowhere in this area would it be possible to put down the point of
the needle without touching some hundreds of gold molecules simul-
taneously.

2IS GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY.

e

According to Professor Liversidge, sea water contains on the
average about 1 grain of gold per ton. If this is the case, then the
above figures for the dilute cyanide solution apply with only a
shght modification to sea water. No drop, however small it may be,
can be removed from the ocean which will not contain many millions
of gold molecules, and no point of its surface can be touched which
is not thickly strewn with these. From this molecular point of view
we must realize that our ships literally float on a gilded ocean !

From time to time adventurers arise who attempt to launch upon
this gilded ocean unseaworthy ships freighted with the savings of the
trusting investor. In order that nothing which has been said here
may tempt anyone to contribute to the freighting of these ships, let
me hasten to point out that the weakest of the cyanide solutions here
referred to is richer in gold than sea water is reported to be. The
practical conclusion from this comparison is sufficiently obvious. If
the cyaniding expert, whose business it 1s to extract gold from dilute
solutions, finds that it does not pay to carry this extraction beyond a
concentration of 2 or 3 grains per ton, even when the solution is
already in his hand, and when, therefore, the costs of treatment are
at their minimum, how can it possibly pay to begin the work of ex-
traction on sea water, a solution of one-half the richness, which would
have to impounded and treated by methods which could not fail to be
more costly in labor and materials than the simple process of zine-box
precipitation? It is generally unsafe to prophesy, but in this case I
am rash enough to risk the prediction that if ever the gold mines of
the Transvaal are shut up it will not be owing to the competition of
the gold resources of the ocean.

In these calculations with reference to the dilute cyanide solutions
it is assumed that the gold molecules are uniformly distributed——that
they are practically equidistant from each other. There appears to
me to be considerable doubt whether we have any right to make this
assumption. Leaving out of account for the moment the action of the
water molecules, it would appear that as long as the gold molecules
are so numerous that a uniform distribution would bring them within
the range of each other’s attraction, we can imagine that all sub-
merged molecules would be in equilibrium so far as the attractions of
their own kind are concerned, being subjected to a uniform pull in all
directions. This condition would certainly make for uniform dis-
tribution. But when the distance between them exceeds the range of
the molecular forces, it is evident that an entirely new condition is
introduced, and it seems not improbable that the widely distributed
molecules would tend to drift into clouds in which they are brought
back within the range of these forces. The range of the cohesive
forces in water and aqueous liquids is usually taken from 50 to 100
micromillimeters, and I am disposed to think that ten times this
GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY. 229

amount would not be an excessive estimate of the range in the case of
gold. If the range for gold be taken as 500 micromillimeters. then
the gold molecules of the dilute gold solution, which are spaced at
400 micromillimeters apart, are just within the range of each other’s
attraction, and their distribution is, therefore, likely to be uniform.
But by a further dilution to half concentration, the equilibrium would
be lable to be disturbed, and denser clouds of gold molecules would
be formed, with less dense intervals between them.

In preparing the zinc boxes through which the gold solution is
passed, very great care has to be exercised to insure that the contact
surface of the zine is used to the best advantage. With this object
the packing of the zinc shavings is so managed that the solution is
spread over the zinc surface in as thin sheets as possible. The object,
of course, is to bring as many of the gold molecules as possible into
actual contact with the zinc. The gold molecules found in the solu-
tion leaving the boxes are those which have not been in contact with
the zinc. Yet we have seen that these molecules are still so numerous
that they are within ,,4,, of an inch of each other. If these mole-
cules are in a state analogous to the gaseous state, with diffusive
energy of the same order as that of the gas molecule, it is difficult to
imagine how they can.escape without coming in contact with the zine
surface during their tortuous passage through the boxes and being
deposited there. Yet they do escape, even when the velocity of the
solution in passing over the zine surfaces is so slow as 10 centimenters
per minute, or 1°6 millimeters per second.

We may regard the condition of these isolated gold molecules, or
the more complex auricyanide of potassium molecules, as typical of
that of the solute molecules in a dilute solution of any nonvolatile
solid. They are solid molecules sparsely distributed among a multi-
tude of intensely active solvent molecules, the temperature of the solu-
tion being many hundred degrees below that at which they could
of themselves assume the greater freedom of the quid or gaseous
state. These solute molecules have to a great extent been set free
from the constraining effect of their cohesive forces, but it is im-
portant to remember that this freedom has not been attained by the
increase of their own kinetic energy as in liquefaction by heat. ‘Their
freedom and the extra kinetic energy they have acquired have in
some way been imparted to them by the more active solvent molecules;
for, if the solvent could be suddenly removed, leaving the solute mole-
cules still similarly distributed in a vacuous space, they would even-
tually condense into a solid aggregate. This must be the case, for
the nonvolatile solute has no measurable vapor pressure at the tem-
perature of the solution. The kinetic energy of the solute molecules
is of itself quite insufficient to endow them with the properties of the
230 GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY.

gaseous or even of the liquid molecule, even when their cohesive forces
have been weakened or overcome by separation.

If the energy employed in this separation is not intrinsic to the
solute molecule then it must in some way have been imparted by the
solvent molecules. It therefore becomes important to compare the
energy endowment of one set of molecules with that of the other.

Compared with other solids, ice at is freezing point has very little
hardness or tenacity: the cohesion of its molecules has been much
relaxed by the great absorption of heat energy between the absolute
zero and the freezing point. If an average specific heat of 0°5 over
the whole range be assumed, the heat absorption of one gram amounts
to 136°5 calories. In the transition to the liquid state at 0° a further
absorption of 79 calories takes place, so that a gram of liquid water
at the freezing point contains the heat energy of 215°5 calories. The
fact that water has the high vapor pressure of 4°6 millimeters of
mercury at the freezing point is probably a result of this enormous
store of energy. Asa liquid, therefore, it is natural to expect that its
molecules will exhibit effects proportionate to this great store of
energy. This expectation appears to be realized when we consider
not only its properties as the universal solvent, but its osmotic and
diffusive energy in solutions in which it is the solvent.

To complete the comparison it 1s only necessary to calculate the
heat energy of gold at 0°. Taking its specific heat as 0°032, a gram
of gold at 0° contains 8-7 calories. A gram molecule, therefore, con-
tains in round numbers 1,700 calories as compared with 3,880 calories
in a gram molecule of water.

Taking into consideration not only this greater store of energy,
but also the much smaller cohesive force of water as compared with
the majority of solid solutes, there can be no doubt that the active
role in aqueous solutions of this type must be assigned to the solvent,
not to the solute molecules.

This leads to the important conclusion that the energy of solution,
of diffusion, and of osmosis is due, not to the imaginary gaseous en-
ergy of the solute, but to the actual liquid energy of the solvent
molecules. When this conclusion is reached a new physical explana-
tion of these phenomena is in our hands, and we are relieved from the
strain to the imagination involved in the application of the gas theory
to solutions of nonvolatile solids.

This transference of the active rédle to the solvent molecules does
not in any way affect the well-established conclusions based on the
laws of thermo-dynamics as to the- energy relations in these phe-
nomena, for it has always been recognized that these conclusions have
reference to the average conditions prevailing in large collections of
relatively minute units. Wherever the gas analogy has appeared to
hold it has not necessarily involved more than this, that the observed
GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY. So

effects are in proportion to the number of these minute units in a
given volume.

In applying the gas theory to the physical explanation of osmotic
pressure it has been the custom to regard this pressure as directly due
to the bombardment of the semipermeable membrane by the solute
molecules. But this conception completely ignores the fact that the
pressure developed is a hydrostatic, not a gaseous pressure, and that
the hydrostatic pressure results directly from the penetration of the
solvent molecules from the other side of the partition.

It appears to me more natural to abandon the gas analogy alto-
gether, to regard the molecules as in the solid and liquid condition
proper to their temperature, and to apportion to them their respective
parts in the active changes according to their obvious endowment of
energy.

Applying this view to the case of a solution and a solvent separated
by a semipermeable membrane, it
is seen that the pressure rises on
the solution side, because the pure
solvent molecules on the other side
have some advantage for the dis-
play of their energy over the simi-
lar molecules in the solution. 7 /zs
effect in its most general form may
be attributed to the dilution of the YY
solvent by the solute molecules. In 7
cases where the osmotic pressure
appears to obey Boyle’s law the
effect is exactly measured by the
number of solute molecules per
unit volume. But the facts of this
position are in no way changed if
the effect is taken to be due to the activity of an equal number of sol-
vent molecules, for we then see that each solute molecule by canceling
the activity of one solvent molecule on the solution side permits a
solvent molecule from the other side to enter the solution.

What the exact mechanism of this cancellation is there is at present
no evidence to show, and the caution originally given by Lord Kelvin
with reference to the undue forcing of the gas analogy must also be
applied to the suggestion now put forward. But as a means of mak-
ing the suggestion a little more clear I give here a simple diagram on
which A represents a single perforation in a semipermeable mem-
brane, P, on both sides of which there is only pure solvent. For the
sake of clearness the molecules are shown only as a single row. Nor-
mally there will be no passage of solvent molecules from side to side,
for the average kinetic energy of the molecules on both sides is equal.

ew GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY.

This state of equilibrium is indicated on the diagram by marking
with a cross the molecule which is exactly halfway through the
partition.

At Ba single solute molecule, S, has been introduced at the right
side. If this molecule exactly cancels the energy of one solute mole-
cule at its own end of the row, the equilibrium point will move one
molecule to the right, the solvent molecules will move in the same
direction, and one of their number will enter on the solution side. So
long as the row iucludes one, and only one, solute molecule, the
equilibrium will remain unchanged and no more solute molecules will
pass in. If another solute molecule arrives on the scene, the equilib-
rium will again be disturbed in the same way as before, and another
solvent molecule will pass into the solution.

This mechanism accomplishes to some extent the work of a “ Max-
well demon,” in so far at least as it takes advantage of the movement
of individual molecules to raise one part of a system at a uniform
temperature to a higher level or energy.

A MECHANICAL VIEW OF DISSOCIATION IN DILUTE SOLUTIONS.

The view that the phenomena of solution depend on the relative
kinetic energy of the solvent and solute molecules appears to apply
with special force to the phenomena of dissociation in dilute solutions.
Under the gas theory there does not appear to be any reason why the
solute molecules should dissociate into their ions. So obvious is this
absence of any physical motive that Professor Armstrong has happily
referred to the dissociation as “ the suicide of the molecules.” Others
have proposed to ascribe the phenomenon to what might be called * the
fickleness of the ions,” thus supposing that the ions have an inherent
love of changing partners. These may be picturesque ways of label-
ing certain views of the situation, but the views themselves do not
appear to supply any clew to the physical nature of the phenomena.
With the acceptance of the view that the phenomena of solution are
largely due to the kinetic energy of the solvent molecules, the phe-
nomena of dissociation also appear to take their place as a natural
result of this activity. For consider the situation of an isolated mole-
cule of cyanide of gold and potassium closely surrounded by and_at
the mercy of some millions of water molecules all in a state of intense
activity. The rude mechanical jostling to which the complex mole-
cule is subjected will naturally tend to break it up into simpler por-
tions which are mechanically more stable. The mechanical analogy
of a ball mill in which the balls are self-driven at an enormous veloc-
ity is probably rather crude, but it may at least help us to picture
what, on the view now advanced, must be essentially a mechanical
operation.
GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY. 233

In importing this mechanical view of the breaking down of com-
plex into simpler molecules we are not without some solid basis of
facts to go upon. My own observations have shown that even in the
solid state the crystalline molecule can be broken down by purely
mechanical means into the simpler units of the amorphous state;
and, further, that the water molecules of a crystal may by the same
agency be broken away from their combination with the salt mole-
cules. Since the publication of the earler of these observations,
Professor Spring has shown that the acid sulphates of the alkali
metals may be mechanically decomposed into two portions, one of
which contains more acid and the other more base than the original
salt. It is important to recognize that in these three apparently
short steps the transition has been made from the overcoming of the
simple cohesion of similar molecules in contact with each other to the
breaking asunder of the chemical union of dissimilar molecules. At
each step the solid molecules appear, not as mere ethereal abstrac-
tions, but as substantial portions of matter which can be touched and
handled mechanically.

The physical properties of a gas are primarily due to its being an
assemblage of rapidly moving molecules. These simpler and more
general properties can coexist with, and may be modified by, the more
complex relations introduced by chemical affinity as it occurs in com-
pound gases and mixtures.

It appears to me quite legitimate similarly to regard the physical
properties of a Miguid as due to its being an assemblage of rapidly
moving molecules. The liquid system is highly condensed, and the
motions of its molecules are controlled by the cohesive as well as by
the repulsive forces. The closer approximation of the molecules
» may reduce their mean free path to an extremely small amount, or it
inay even cause their translatory motion to disappear, so that the
whole kinetic energy of the hquid molecules may be in the form of
rotation or vibration.

As we can imagine a perfect gas, so also may we imagine a perfect
liquid, the physical properties of which are as simply related to the
laws of dynamics as are those of the gas. But the conditions of the
liquid state being also those most favorable to the play of chemical
affinity, the internal equilibrium of solutions or of mixed liquids
must be a resultant of this affinity, together with the primary forces
of the ideal liquid state.

An ideally perfect solution—that is, a solution of the physical prop-
erties of which are determined solely by the number of molecules it
contains in a given volume—must consist of a solvent and a solute
which have no chemical affinity for each other, so that their mole-
cules will neither associate nor dissociate in solution, Probably only

sm 1905——19
234 GOLD IN SCIENCE AND IN INDUSTRY.

comparatively few solutions will be found which even approximate
to this ideal perfection. But it appears to me that the study of the
problems of the liquid and the dissolved states may be much simph-
fied by the recognition (1) that the primary physical properties of
liquids and solutions are due to the fact that they are assemblages
of molecules endowed with the amount and the kind of kinetic energy
which is proper to their temperature; and (2) that as these primary
physical properties of the liquid and dissolved states may be masked
and interfered with by chemical affinity, they should be studied as
far as possible in examples where the influence of this force is either
absent or at a minimum.

Submarine navigation has engaged the attention of inventors and
attracted general interest for a very long period. Its practical appli-
cation to purposes of war was made about one hundred and thirty
years ago. The main object of that application was to threaten, or if
possible destroy, an enemy’s battle ships engaged in blockade by
means of under-water attacks, delivered by vessels of small dimen-
sions and cost, which could dive and navigate when submerged.
From the first, submarines were admittedly weapons favored by the
weaker naval power, and as a consequence their construction found
little favor with our naval authorities. Under the conditions which
prevailed a century ago in regard to materials of construction, pro-
pelling apparatus and explosives, the construction of submarines
necessarily proceeded on a limited scale, and the type practically died
out of use almost at its birth. Enough had been done, however, to
demonstrate its practicability and to make it a favorite field of inyes-
ugation for inventors, some of whom contemplated wide extensions
of submarine navigation. Every naval war gave fresh incentive to
these proposals and led to the construction of experimental vessels.
This was the case during the Crimean war, when the Admiralty had
a submarine vessel secretly built and tried by a special committee, on
which, among others, Mr. Scott-Russell and Sir Charles Fox served.
Again, during the civil war in America the Confederates constructed
a submarine vessel, and used it against the blockading squadron off
Charleston. After several abortive attempts and a considerable
loss of life they succeeded in destroying the Federal Housatonic, but
their submarine, with all its crew, perished in the enterprise.

It is impossible to give even a summarized statement of other
efforts made in this direction from 1860 onward to 1880, but one

ean not leave unnoticed the work done in the United States by Mr.
Holland, who devoted himself for a quarter of a century to continu-
ous experiment on submarines and eventually achieved success. The
Holland type was first adopted by the United States Navy, and was
subsequently accepted by the British Admiralty as the point of de-
parture for our subsequent construction of submarines. In France
also successive designs for submarines were prepared by competent
naval architects, and a few vessels were built and tried. The Plon-
geur, of 1860, was a submarine of large size, considerable cost, and
well-considered design; but her limited radius of action and com-
paratively low speed left her for many years without a successor on
the French navy list. The high relative standing attained by the
French navy as compared with our own, in consequence of the vigor-
ous action of the Emperor Napoleon III in developing steam propul-
sion and armor protection for seagoing ships, no doubt greatly in-
fluenced French policy at that time and delayed development of sub-
marine construction. When conditions were altered in consequence
of the Franco-German war of 1870, and the position of the French
navy in relation to the British became less favorable, it was natural
that the question of submarine construction should assume greater
importance in France. In the interval, moreover, great advances
had been made in materials of construction and in means of propul-
sion available for submarines. The extended use of steel and the
practical applications of electricity gave to designers greater facili-
ties than existed previously, and public interest in the construction of
submarines and small, swift vessels was increased by the writings of
the jeune école, who strongly condemned the continued construction
of armored “ mastodons.” -

The modern development of submarines for war purposes is chietly
due to French initiative. During the earlier stages of this develop-
ment progress was extremely slow. The Gymnote was ordered in
1886 and the Gustave Zédé in 1888, and the trials continued over
nearly eight years, large sums of money being spent thereon. In
1896 competitive designs for submarines were invited, but no great
activity was displayed in this department of construction until the
Fashoda incident two years later. Since that time remarkable de-
velopments have been made in France, considerable numbers of sub-
marines have been laid down, rival types have been constructed, and
many designers have been engaged in the work. Up to the present
time about 70 submarines and submersibles have been ordered;
in July, 1904, the total number of completed vessels was 28,
and at the end of 1907 it is estimated that France will possess
60 completed submarines, with a total displacement of nearly
13,600 tons. The first French submarine of modern type, the
Gymnote, was 56 feet long and of 30 tons displacement. The latest
SUBMARINE NAVIGATION. 237

types are nearly 150 feet long and of 420 tons displacement. The
cost of a French submarine designed in 1898 was about £26,000.
The estimated cost of the latest and largest vessels is about £70,000.
The French have pursued no continuous policy in this development,
but have alternated between vessels of comparatively large and others
of much smaller displacement. This course had much to recommend
it, no doubt, as it brought many accomplished naval architects into
competition; but the lack of a continuous and progressive policy has
resulted in dissatisfaction and difficulty, and this is frankly acknowl-
edged by French -authorities. Two years elapsed after the date
when the French resolutely undertook the construction of submarines
before the British Admiralty ordered five vessels of the Holland type
from Messrs. Vickers, Maxim & Co., who had acquired the con-
cession for the use of the Holland Company’s patents. These first
vessels in essentials were repetitions of the type which had been tried
and officially approved by the authorities of the United States Navy.
It was agreed that all improvements made by the Holland Company
should be at the service of the British Admiralty through the Eng-
lish concessionaires. In this manner the royal navy at once acquired
advantages attaching to the long experience and great skill of Mr.
Holland, and with that advantage there was associated the possibility
of utilizing their own technical resources and those of Messrs. Vick-
ers, Maxim & Co. For five years a continuous policy has been fol-
lowed in the development of our submarines, all of which have been
constructed at Barrow-in-Furness. There has been a great develop-
ment in size, speed, and general efficiency, resulting necessarily in
‘correspondingly greater cost per vessel. Information of an official
and authoritative character relating to submarines is freely published
in France and the United States, but for British submarines corre-
sponding official information is scanty. It has for years been the rule
to give in the navy estimates full particulars of dimensions and costs
for all other classes of British war ships, but for submarines a policy
of secrecy is adopted that is most unreasonable and unnecessary.
From the best sources of information accessible it appears that the
growth in size, with a correspondingly increased cost, has been even
nore rapid here than in France. Our first five submarines are 63 feet
in length, 120 tons in displacement, with gasoline engines of 160 horse-
power for surface propulsion, giving a speed of 8 to 9 knots. The
electric motors for submerged propulsion are estimated to give a
speed of about 7 knots. The contract price for each vessel in the
United States was about £34,000, and that is about the price paid for
our earliest vessels. The latest type of which particulars are avail-
able are said to be about 150 feet in length, 300 tons in displacement,
and with gasolene engines of 850 horsepower for surface propulsion,
giving a surface speed of 13 knots and a radius of action of 500 miles.
238 SUBMARINE NAVIGATION.

The underwater speed is 9 knots and the radius of action when sub-
merged about 90 miles. No official particulars have been published
as to the contract price for these vessels, which is certainly an unde-
sirable course to adopt, seeing that for other and admittedly sufficient
reasons these contracts have not been subject to competition as yet.
~{t may be hoped that the Admiralty will reconsider this matter and
treat submarines similarly to other vessels.

In French official classification a distinction is made between sub-
marines and submersibles, and this terminology has been the cause
of some confusion. Both classes are capable of diving when required
and both can make passages at the surface. In this surface condition
a considerable portion of the vessel lies above the water surface and
constitutes what is technically called a “reserve of buoyancy.” In
the submersible this reserve of buoyancy and the accompanying free-
board is greater than in the submarine type, and in this respect lies
the chief difference between the two types. The submersible has
higher freeboard and greater reserve of buoyancy, which secures
better seagoing qualities and greater habitability. The deck or
platform is situated higher above water, and to it the crew can find
access in ordinary weather when making passages and obtain exer-
cise and fresh air. Recent exhaustive trials in France are reported
to have established the great superiority of the submersible type
when the service contemplated may involve sea passages of consider-
able length. The French policy, as recently announced, contemplates
the construction of submersibles of about 400 tons displacement for
such extended services and proposes to restrict the use of submarines
to coast and harbor defense, for which vessels of about 100 tons dis-
placement are to be employed. All recent British submarines would
be ranked as submersibles according to the French classification, and
it is satisfactory to know, as the result of French experiments,
that our policy of construction proves to have distinct advantages.
In addition to these two types of diving or submarine vessels, the
French are once more discussing plans which have been repeatedly
put forward and practically applhed by M. Goubet, namely, the
construction of small portable submarine vessels which could be
hfted on board large ships and transported to any desired scene of
operations. In the royal navy for many years past it has been the
practice to similarly lft and carry second-class torpedo or vedette
boats about 20 tons in weight. Lifting appliances for dealing
with these heavy boats have been designed and fitted in all our large
cruisers and in battle ships, and a few ships have been built as * boat
carriers.” The first of these special depot ships in the royal navy
was the Vulcan, ordered in 1887-88, the design being in essentials that
prepared by the writer at Elswick in 1883. The French have also
built a special vessel, named the /oudre, which has been adapted for
SUBMARINE NAVIGATION. 939

transporting small submarines to Saigon and performed the service
without difficulty. Whether this development of small portable
submarines will take effect or not remains at present an open question,
but there will be no mechanical difficulty either in the production of
the vessels themselves or in the means for lifting and carrying them.
M. Goubet worked out with complete success designs for vessels about
26 feet long and less than 10 tons displacement, with speeds of 5 to
6 knots, the trials of which have been very fully described, but French
authorities have not adopted the type and no decision seems to have
been taken to introduce it. In this country no similar action has
been taken, and our smallest submarines, weighing 120 tons, can not be
regarded as “ portable.” Indeed, some leading British authorities on
submarines have indicated that experience is adverse to the con-
struction of vessels in which not more than two or three men would
form the crew, and on that ground have condemned the construction
of these small submarines. They would necessarily be of slow speed
and very limited radius of action, while their efficient working would
depend upon the nerve and skill of only two or three men working in
a very confined space.

Progress in mechanical engineering and in metallurgy has been
great since Bushnell constructed and used his first submarine in 1776,
during the war between the United States and this country. These
advances have made it possible to increase the dimensions, speed, and
radius of action of submarines; their offensive powers have been
enlarged by the use of locomotive torpedoes, and superior optical
arrangements have been devised for discovering the position of an
enemy while they themselves remain submerged. But it can not be
claimed that any new principle of design has been discovered or
applied. From descriptions left on record by Bushnell and still ex-
tant it is certain that he appreciated and provided for the governing
conditions of the design in regard to buoyancy, stability, and control
of the depth reached by submarines. Indeed, Bushnell showed the
‘way to his suecessors in nearly all these particulars, and, although
alternative methods of fulfilling essential conditions have been intro-
duced and practically tested, in the end Bushnell’s plans have in
substance been found the best. The laws which govern the flotation
of submarines are, of course, identical with those applying to other
floating bodies. When they are at rest and in equilibrium they must
displace a weight of water equal to their own total weight. At the
surface they float at a minimum draft and possess in this “ awash”
condition a sufficient free board and reserve of buoyancy to fit them
for propulsion. When submarines are being prepared for “ diving”
water is admitted to special tanks, and the additional weight in-
creases immersion and correspondingly reduces reserve of buoyancy.
In some small submarines comparative success has been attained in
240 SUBMARINE NAVIGATION.

reaching and maintainmg any desired depth below the surface
simply by the admission of the amount of water required to secure
a perfect balance between the weight of the vessel and all she con-
tains and the weight of water which would fill the cavity occupied by
the submarine when submerged. For all practical purposes and
within the depths reached by submarines on service water may be
regarded as incompressible. The submarine should, therefore, rest
in equilibrium at any depth if her total weight is exactly balanced
by the weight of water displaced. If the weight of the vessel ex-
ceeds by ever so small an amount the weight of water displaced, that
excess constitutes an accelerating force tending to sink the vessel
deeper. On the contrary, if the weight of water displaced exceeds
by ever so small an amount the total weight of the vessel, a vertical
force is produced tending to restore her to the surface. Under these
circumstances 1t is obvious that if the admission or expulsion of water
from internal tanks (or the extrusion or withdrawal of cylindrical
plungers for the purpose of varying the displacement) were the only
means of controlling vertical movement, it would be exceedingly
difficult to reach or to maintain any desired depth. This difficulty
was anticipated on theoretical grounds and has been verified on serv-
ice—in some cases with considerable risks to the experimentalists—
the submarines having reached the bottom befoye the vertical motion
could be checked. It has consequently become the rule for all sub-
raarines to be left with a small reserve of buoyancy when brought into
the diving condition. Submergence is then effected by the action of
liorizontal rudders controlled by operators within the vessels.
Under these conditions submergence only continues as long as on-
ward motion is maintained, since there is no effective pressure on
the rudders when the vessel is at rest The smallest reserve of buoy-
ancy should always bring a submarine to the surface if her onward
motion ceases, and, as a matter of fact, in the diving condition that
reserve is extremely small, amounting to only 300 pounds (equiva-
lent to 30 gallons of water) in vessels of 120 tons total weight. This
is obviously a narrow margin of safety and necessitdtes careful and
skilled management on the part of those in charge of submarines. A
small change in the density of the water, such as occurs in an estuary
or in the lower reaches of a great river, would speedily obliterate the
reserve of buoyancy and cause the vessel to sink if water was not
expelled from the tanks. Moreover, variations in weight of the sub-
marine (due to the consumption of fuel, the discharge of torpedoes,
or other causes) must sensibly affect the reserve of buoyancy, and
arrangements must be made to compensate for these variations by
admitting equal weights of water in positions that will maintain the
“trim” of the vessel. Additional safeguards against foundering
have been provided in some submarines by fitting detachable ballast.
SUBMARINE NAVIGATION. 241

The more common plan is to make arrangements for rapidly expel-
ling water from the tanks either by means of pumps or by the use of
compressed air. In modern submarines with locomotive torpedoes
compressed air is, of course, a necessity, and can be readily applied
in the manner described if it is desired to increase their buoyancy.

The conditions of stability of submarines when diving are also
special. At the surface, owing to their singular form, the longitu-
dinal stability is usually much less than that of ordinary ships.
When submerged their stability is the same in all directions, and it
is essential that the center of gravity shall be kept below the center
of buoyancy. This involves no difficulty, because water-ballast tanks
can be readily built in the lower portions of the vessels. Small sta- |
bility in the longitudinal sense, however, necessitates great care in the
maintenance of trim and in the avoidance of serious movements of
weights within the vessels. Moreover, when a vessel is diving under
the action of her longitudinal rudders she is extremely sensitive to
changes of trim and great skill is required on the part of operators
in charge of working the rudders. As the underwater speed is in-
creased the pressure on the rudders for a given angle increases as the
square of the velocity, and sensitiveness to change of trim becomes
ereater. This fact makes the adoption of higher underwater speed
a matter requiring very serious consideration. Some authorities
who have given great attention to the construction of submarines
have been opposed to the adoption of high speeds under water, be-
cause of the danger that vessels when diving quickly may reach much
greater depths than are desirable. Causes of disturbance which
might be of small importance when the underwater speed is moder-
ate may have a greatly exaggerated effect when higher speeds are
reached. Cases are on record where modern submarines in the hands
of skilled crews have accidentally reached the bottom in great depths
of water and have had no easy task to regain the surface. Tor these
reasons it is probable that while speeds at the surface will be in-
creased, underwater speeds will not grow correspondingly. Indeed,
the tactics of submarines hardly appear to require high speed under
water, seeing that it is an important element in successful attack to
make the final dive at a moderate distance from the enemy. It is
authoritatively stated that in our submarines complete control of ver-
tical movements has been secured by means of skilled operators, and
that a constant but moderate depth below the surface can be main-
tained. Proposals have been made and successfully applied to small
submarines for automatically regulating the depth of submergence
by apparatus similar to that used in locomotive torpedoes. ‘For the
larger submarines now used such automatic apparatus does not find
favor, and better results are obtained with trained men.
249 SUBMARINE NAVIGATION.

The possibility of descending to considerable depths has to be
kept in view when deciding on the form and structural arrangements
of submarines, which may be subjected accidentally to very great ex-
ternal pressure. It is absolutely necessary to success that under the
highest pressure likely to be endured there shall be rigidity of form,
as local collapse of even a very limited amount might be accompanied
by a diminution in displacement that would exceed the reserve of
buoyancy. This condition is not difficult of fulfillment, and the ap-
proximately circular form usually adopted for the cross sections of
submarines favors their resistence to external pressure.

Under former conditions there was difficulty in remaining long
under water without serious inconvenience from the impurity of the
air. Now, by suitable arrangements and chemical applances, a
supply of pure air can be obtained for considerable periods, sufficient
indeed for any operations likely to be undertaken.

The use of gasoline engines for surface propulsion has many
advantages. It favors increase in speed and radius of action, and
enables submarines to be more independent and _ self-supporting.
Storage batteries can be recharged, air compressed, and other auxil-
jary services performed independently of any “ mother” ship. At the
same time it is desirable to give to each group of submarines a
supporting ship, serving as a base and store depot, and this has been
arranged in this county as well as in France. With gasoline engines,
care must be taken to secure thorough ventilation and to avoid the
formation of explosive mixtures of gas and air, otherwise accidents
must follow.

Little information is available as regards the success of “ peri-
scopes ” and other optical instruments which have been devised for
the purpose of enabling those in command of submarines to obtain
information as to their surroundings when submerged. In this
department secrecy is obviously desirable, and no one can complain
of official reticence. From published accounts of experimental work-
ing abroad as well as in this country, it would appear that considerable
success has been obtained with these optical instruments in compara-
tively smooth water. It is also asserted that when the lenses are
subjected to thorough washing by wave water they remain efficient.
On the other hand, the moderate height of the lenses above water
must expose them to the danger of being wetted by spray even in a
very moderate sea, and experience in torpedo boats and destroyers
places it beyond doubt that the resultant conditions must greatly
interfere with efficient vision. In heavier seas the comparatively
small height of the lenses above water must often impose more
serious limitations in the use of the periscopes and similar instru-
ments. Improvements are certain to be made as the result of experi-
ence with these optical apphances, and we may be sure that in their
SUBMARINE NAVIGATION. 243

use officers and men of the royal navy will be as expert as any of
their rivals. But when all that is possible has been done, it must
remain true that increase in offensive power and in immunity from
attack obtained by submergence will be accompanied by unavoidable
limitations as well as by special risks resulting from the sacrifice of
buoyancy and the great reduction in longitudinal stability which are
unavoidable when diving. These considerations have led many per-
sons to favor the construction of so-called surface boats rather than
submarines. They would resemble submersibles in many respects,
but the power of diving would be surrendered, although they would
be so constructed that by admitting water by special tanks they
could be deeply immersed and show only a small target above the
surface when making an attack. There would be no necessity in
such surface vessels to use electric motors and storage batteries, since
internal combustion engines could be used under all circumstances.
Hence it would be possible without increase of size to construct
vessels of greater speed and radius of action and to simplify designs
in other important features. It is not possible to predict whether
this suggestion to adopt surface boats rather than submersibles will
have a practical result, but it 1s unquestionable that improvements
in or alternatives to internal combustion engines will favor the in-
crease of power in relation to weight, and so will tend to the pro-
duction of vessels of higher speed. The comparatively slow speed of
existing submarines as compared with destroyers and torpedo boats
of ordinary types admittedly involves serious limitations in their
chances of successful attack on vessels under way, and higher surface
speeds are desirable.

Concurrently with the construction of submarines, experiments
have been made in this country and abroad to discover the best means
of defense against this method of attack. Here, again, authentic
details are necessarily wanting, since the various naval authorities
naturally wish to keep discoveries to themselves. It is very probable,
however, that published accounts of tests between swift destroyers,
vedette boats, and submarines are not altogether inaccurate, and
according to these accounts the periscopes of submarines have been
found useful by assailants as the means of determining the position
of the submarines and aiding their entanglement. Comparatively
limited structural damage to a submarine in the diving condition may
be accompanied by an inflow of water in a short period which will
result in the loss of the vessel. The accident to Submarine A 1, which
was struck by a passing mail steamer, illustrates this danger. It is
reasonable to accept the published reports that large charges of high
explosives exploded at a moderate distance may have a serious effect
against submarines and cause them to founder. Their small reserve
of buoyancy in the diving condition makes them specially liable to
244 SUBMARINE NAVIGATION.

risks of foundering rapidly, and little more than a crevice may prac-
tically fill the interior with water in a very short time when the vessel
is submerged even to a moderate depth. On the other hand, reports
which have appeared of the maneuvers in France and elsewhere,
when attacks have been made by submarines on vessels at anchor or
underway, show a considerable percentage of successes. Such
exercises are valuable, no doubt, for purposes of training, but under
peace conditions it is necessary to avoid the risks of damage to
submarines, which might easily become serious if the defense were
pressed home, as it would be in war. When the officers and crews of
submarines know that they will be- treated more considerately than
in real warfare they will naturally take chances, and make attacks
involving possible destruction under the conditions of a real action.
In short, naval maneuvers in this department, while they may be
useful in increasing the skill and confidence of officers and men in
the management of submarines, can be no real test of fighting
efficiency.

Submarines and air ships have certain points of resemblance, and
proposals have been made repeatedly to associate the two types or to
use air ships as a means of protection from submarine attacks. One
French inventor seriously suggested that a captive balloon attached
to a submarine should be the post of observation from which informa-
tion should be telephoned to the submarine as to the position of an
enemy. He evidently had little trust in periscopes and overlooked the
dangers to which the observers in the car of the balloon would be
exposed from an enemy’s gun fire. Quite recently a proposal has been
made by M. Santos Dumont to use air ships as a defense against
submarines, his idea being that a dirigible air ship of large dimen-
sions, and moving at a considerable height above the surface of the
sea could discover the whereabouts of a submarine, even at some depth
below the surface, and could effect its destruction by dropping high
explosive charges upon the helpless vessel. Here, again, the inventor,
in his eagerness to do mischief, has not appreciated adequately the
risks which the air ship would run if employed in the manner pro-
posed, as submarines are not likely to be used without supporting ves-
sels. Hitherto submarines themselves have been armed only with
torpedoes; but it has been proposed recently to add guns, and this can
be done, if desired, in vessels possessing relatively large freeboard.
No doubt if gun armaments are introduced, the tendency will be to
further increase dimensions and cost, and the decision will be gov-
erned by the consideration of the gain in fighting power as compared
with increased cost. As matters stand, submarines are practically
helpless at the surface when attacked by small swift vessels, and it is
natural that advocates of the type should desire to remedy this condi-
tion. Surface boats, if built, will undoubtedly carry guns as well as
SUBMARINE NAVIGATION. 945

torpedoes, and in them the gun fittings would be permanent, whereas
in submarines certain portions of the armament would have to be
removed when vessels were prepared for diving.

Apart from the use of submarine vessels for purposes of war, their
adoption as a means of navigation has found favor in many quarters.
Jules Verne, in his Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea, has
drawn an attractive picture of what may be possible in this direction,
and others have favored the idea of combining the supposed advan-
tages of obtaining buoyancy from bodies floating at some depth below
the surface with an airy promenade carried high above water. Not
many years ago an eminent naval architect drew a picture of what
might be accomplished by utilizing what he described as the “ un-
troubled water below” in association with the freedom and pure air
obtainable on a platform carried high above the waves. These
suggestions, however, are not in accord with the accepted theory of
wave motion, since they take no note of the great depths to which
the disturbance due to wave motion penetrates the ocean. The
problems of stability incidental to such plans are also of a character
not easily dealt with, and consequently there is but a remote prospect
of the use of these singular combinations of submarine and aerial
superstructures. There is little likelihood of the displacement of
ocean steamships at an early date by either navigable air ships or
submarines, and the dreams of Jules Verne or Santos Dumont will
not be realized until much further advance has been made in the
design and construction of the vessels they contemplate.
LIBERIA.¢

By Sir Harry JOHNSTON, G. C. M. G., K. C. B.

Liberia is a portion of the West African coast lands which may be
styled the end of Northern Guinea. Its southernmost promontory—
Cape Palmas—of all the Guinea coast projects farthest southward, to
scarcely more than 4° from the equator. The northern political
boundary of Liberia meets the coast at the mouth of the river Mano
in north latitude 7°. The actual boundary on the south, between
Liberia and the French possessions on the Ivory coast, is the course
of the river Kavalli, the mouth of which river hes about 13 miles to
the east of Cape Palmas, in latitude 4° 22’. The northernmost ex-
tremity of Liberian territory on the coast lies just to the south of that
marshy and densely forested portion of the Sierra Leone colony—the
Sherbro district—which one might say, with a fairly accurate guess,
was the farthest point reached by the Carthaginian explorer Hanno
in his celebrated voyage of discovery along the northwest coast of
Africa in about 520 B. C. It is probable that the “ gorillas ” which
Hanno’s expedition captured somewhere in the vicinity of the Sher-
bro River or of northern Liberia was the chimpanzees still found in
these regions.

It will be seen on the map that Liberia occupies a most important
strategic position on the west coast of Africa. The general trend of
its coast is from northwest to southeast, parallel to the course taken
by steamers plying across the Atlantic between Europe and South
Africa. It might, in fact, in the hands of a strong naval power,
exercise a very dominating influence over the eastern Atlantic, which
is ohe reason, among many others, why Great Britain desires to see
the independence of the Liberian Republic preserved and maintained.

The country of Liberia as a whole is one dense forest. It is prac-
tically the culmination of the West African forest, the regions to the
north, east, and west having been more extensively cleared by man
in past times, or partaking more of the park-land, grass-grown char-

led

acter owing to their less copious rainfall. Now that two English
companies, In conjunction with the Government of Liberia, are en-
deavoring to develop the resources of the interior and to accumulate
knowledge regarding the climate and products, attempts are being
made to record the rainfall, as to the extent of which at present only
a guess can be made. It is probable that south of latitude 8° 30’ the
average annual rainfall of Liberia is not less than 100 inches. Ad-
joing regions in Sierra Leone have a recorded rainfall of something
hike 130 inches, so that this is probably an under rather than an over
estimate. North of latitude 8° 30’ the rainfall diminishes probably
to 60 or 80 inches per annum, and in consequence the dense forest
gives way to a pastoral country of savannas, grassy hills, or park
lands of grass, with dense forest along the stream valleys. Mr.
Alexander Whyte, well known by his many years’ work as an official
in charge of botanical departments in the British East African Pro-
tectorates, spent a good deal of 1904 in Liberia, and in the report
which he drew up for my information he considers that this country,
which has a seaboard of approximately 350 miles long (from north-
west to southeast) and a total superficies of about 45,000 square
miles, has two somewhat different climates, depending, no doubt, a
good deal on the latitude. In the southern regions, below latitude
6°, the rainiest time of the year appears to be the months of March to
June and August to December. North of this—round Monrovia,
for example—the specially rainy months are April to the end of July,
September, and October.

From my own experience of Liberia, I should say that the heavy
‘ainy season begins in April and lasts till the end of July. Then
there is a pause of a month or six weeks with less rain, the heavy rains
beginning again in September and lasting till the middle of Novem-
ber. From mid-November till the end of March is the dry season, at
any rate in the northern half of Liberia, but in the southern part
this dry season is not much more marked than it is in the Niger Delta.
Rain, in fact, may fall in any month of the year. Between November
and April is the worst season for storms, some of which are very
violent.

When I first visited the coast of Liberia, in 1882 and 1885, the
primeval forest grew down to the sea along a great proportion of
the coast; but when I revisited this country in the summer of 1904,
and touched at a good many places at the coast where I had noted
forest growing as late as 1888, much of this big-tree woodland had
been swept away to make room for plantations or even for towns.
In fact, with a few exceptions, the big-tree and rubber-producing
forest does not usually begin in its most marked characteristics until
a journey of at least 15 miles has been made inland from the coast.
I have estimated, from the reports of the agents of the British com-

panies and from the accounts of Liberian, British, and French
explorers, that out of the 45,000 square miles which may be approxi-
mately assigned as the area of the Liberian Republic, at least 25,000
square miles consist of dense, uncleared forest, penetrated, it may be,
by narrow native paths, but as often as not only pierced by elephant-
made tracks. About 3,500 square miles represent the plantations,
gardens, towns, and settlements of the Americo-Liberians along the
coast and 2,000 or 3,000 square miles the clearings made by the indig-
enous natives in the dense forest. The remainder of the territory—
avout 15,000 square miles—is grass or park land in the possession of
the Mandingo tribes, who are great cattle breeders. This is the
characteristic of the far interior of Liberia, where it borders on the
French possessions of Upper Nigeria. From all accounts I can col-
lect, as well as from the little I have seen myself, I do not think that
much of the interior of Liberia can be described as marshy. It is,
on the other hand, inclined to be hilly, and at distances of from 40 to
i100 miles inland the ranges of hills reach altitudes which might
almost be dignified by the name of mountains. Some of these
mountains (the Nimba range) attain heights of over 6,000 feet—this,
at any rate, is the height ascribed to them by certain French explor-
ers; and from what I am told by Mr. Maitland Pye-Smith, one of
the agents of the aforesaid British companies, I am inclined to think
that 4,000 feet, at any rate, is reached or exceeded by peaks in the
Satro range. If the reports of certain travelers are justified, how-
ever, it may well turn out that there are altitudes (such as Mount
Druple) on the Franco-Liberian border of over 9,000 feet, and conse-
quently higher than anything that is to be met in West Africa south
of the upper Niger and west of the Kamerun. Some of these moun-
tain sides are precipitous, with faces of bare roek. Others, again,
are clothed with dense vegetation to their summits, and this continu-
ance of dense and lofty forests for miles and miles and miles will be a
terrible hindrance to surveying in the future, while at the present time
it gives to Liberian exploration the same sad and somewhat dreary
character that has been so powerfully described by Stanley in record-
ing his adventures in the great Kongo forest. Much as the botanist
may glory in the splendid vegetation, I really think that in the long
run one wearies more quickly and easily of forest than of desert.
Forest, in fact, is the distinguishing feature of Liberia asa country ;
it is the climax of the forest region of West Africa. In and from the
forest will be derived the great future wealth of this country. The
geologic formation would appear to be mainly Archean, and the rocks
are mostly granite and quartz, with here and there indications of
voleanic tuff. The rocks near the seacoast and in the coast ranges of
hills are much impregnated with iron, and are consequently very red

in color. The appearance of this rock, especially where it is revealed
by the roads which the Americo-Liberians have cleared in the coast
region, 1s curiously pitted and honeycombed. It is hard, becoming
especially indurated on exposure, and this makes it a good surface for
road making, as it does not degenerate into mud. Very little is known
about the possible mineral wealth of Liberia up to the present time, as
the extremely dense forest of the interior is a great obstacle to a rapid
survey of the country. Apart from hematite iron, which appears to
exist nearly everywhere, there are traces of gold in the mud of the
rivers, and native stories assert the existence of alluvial gold in the
Mandingo uplands beyond the forest region. Lead has been dis-
covered recently in the Kelipo country in eastern Liberia, and zinc ore
in the vicinity of Monrovia. In the Kavall region there is a great
deal of corundum in the rocks. It has been alleged that a diamond
was discovered in the hills behind Grand Basa by a Liberian, but as
vet no confirmation of this discovery has reached me; nor have I been
able to ascertain where the copper comes from which is used to a
limited extent in some of the Mandingo weapons from the far interior.

The Liberian forests contain most of the West African timber trees.
Such ebony as is exported, however, does not seem to be so good as
that which is derived from the genus Diospyros. It is very probably
derived from a papilionaceous tree belonging to the botanical genus of
Dalbergia The wealth of this forest in india-rubber-producing trees,
vines, and bushes is without parallel in any other part of Africa, unless
it be one or two small areas of the Kongo basin. Counting the four
rubber-producing figs, there appear to be at least twenty-two trees,
plants, or vines which produce saleable rubber. These species include
the well-known and widespread Landolphia owariensis and the mag-
nificent Puntumia elastica, the rubber tree once so abundant in Lagos
colony. The Funtumia elastica is stated to grow to over 200 feet in
height. It closely resembles in appearance the allied species Puntumia
ufricana, but there is a very considerable difference in the price of the
rubber yielded by the one and the other—the rubber derived from /'wii-
tumia africana may, perhaps, be sold for 18 pence a pound, but the
well-prepared rubber of Funtumia elastica ranges in value from 3 to
4 shillings. The distinctive features of the leaves, flowers, and fruit,
which enable the observer to decide whether he is tapping the valu-
able or the valueless Muntumia, will shortly be illustrated in my book
on Liberia. The range of the Funtumia elastica appears to extend
from the middle of Liberia eastward as far as western Uganda. It
is found in a portion of the Bahr-al-Ghazal region and in the northern

part of the Kongo Free State. The Puntumia africana is more strictly
West African in its range, from Portuguese Guinea to the Kongo
basin. in the western regions of the Kongo Free State and in Angola
2 third Funtumia is found, which, like Funtumia africana, is of not
much value to the rubber trade. Mr. Alexander Whyte, in his system-
atic examination of the Liberian flora, which he undertook at my
request during 1904, has discovered two new species of wild coffee
Coffea nudiflora and Coffea ligustrifolia. The well-known Liberian
coffee with a big berry is, of course, indigenous to the country, and is
now being exclusively cultivated by the Americo-Liberians on the
coast.

In Liberia, of course, as in most densely forested countries, the
displays in color masses of large aggregations of flowers are not so
often observed as in the park lands and more open country. Still,
there are many objects of beauty in the forest which should be
enumerated as prominent features in Liberian scenery. Every pool
and creek of still water is covered with water lilies, chiefly the com-
mon Vymphea lotus, a small variety of which is also present, and is
peculiar to Liberia. In the damp glades there are abundance of
Crinum and Hamanthus lies. A small and very beautiful ter-
restrial orchis grows on the surface of the water in shallow pools.
In the dense forests there are numerous epiphytic orchids, chiefly
Angrecums, with enormously long nectaries. A species of vanilla
grows wild in the bush. There are many zingiberaceous plants in
the undergrowth of the forest, sometimes with large and delicately
colored flowers, at others remarkable for the size and rich coloring
of their leaves. Among these may be noted Costus, Amomum,
Thalia, and Renealmia. Another family of plants well represented
in the undergrowth, and remarkable for the variety and beauty of
their foliage, are the arums. Prominent among these are Ancho-
manes, Culcasia, Nephthytis, Aglaonema, and Cytosperma. The
Lonchocarpus tree has at times magnificent displays of lilac blossom,
not unlike wistaria in shape and color. The waxy-white camelia-
like flowers of the Anona are objects of great beauty, especially where
they are thickly clustered along the horizontal branches. The J/us-
sendas also light up the forest with their red or white bracts. One
Mussenda, or a closely allied plant, has gorgeous scarlet-crimson
bracts like a Ponsettia; another, which is very common, not only in
Liberia, but throughout the whole forest region of West Africa from
Portuguese Guinea to Uganda, has a cluster of large white bracts
below the yellow flowers. These bracts, which are leaflike in shape
(though not like the leaves of the plant itself), look at a distance
like foliage cut out of white velvet. The Ochna multiflora is a
beautiful flowering tree.

952 LIBERIA.

3eyond the forest region a parklike country is entered, inhabited
for the most part nowadays by a more or less Mohammedanized
people, belonging chiefly to the Mandingo stock. These Mandingos
keep large herds of cattle, examples of which find their way down
to the coast through the forest roads. They are similar to the breed
which is on sale at the market of Sierra Leone—smallish, straight-
backed cattle (without a hump), one-colored as a rule (fawn or gray
or reddish-yellow), with rather long horns. This breed resembles
in miniature the long-horned Gala ox which is found in southern
Abyssinia, and thence, with several breaks in its distribution, to
Uganda and the west side of Tanganyika, and across the Nile to the
shores of Lake Chad. The Mandingo ox is, to my thinking, simply a
dwarfed variety of this Gala breed, which seems to have been the
oldest form of domestic ox known in Africa. In origin it is thought
to be more connected with the Indian cattle than with the descendants
of Bos taurus; but when it is found in its purest form, it has not
got the hump that is associated with the zebu species, though it
freely mixes with that type, and sometimes thus acquires the zebu
hump in addition to the characteristics of the extremely long,
spreading horns (longest in the cow) and the tendency to be one-
colored. I am not so sure myself that this type of ox is necessarily
descended from Bos indicus. It is represented in the paintings of
the Egyptian monuments together with the zebu type. It may have
been descended from an intermediate type of wild ox native to north-
east Africa—intermediate between Bos taurus and Bos indicus.

In this open Mandingo country of hills, mountains, and grass lands
there is said to be a great deal of big game. The lion exists there,
hartebeests of the West African type, water buck, giraffe, roan ante-
lope, reed buck, possibly zebra, rhinoceros, and giraffe. Elephants
are abundant all over Liberia down to within about 30 miles of the
coast region. In fact, many of the paths through the forest are little
else than elephant tracks. Elephants are a good deal dreaded by the
natives of the forest region, as they are alleged to attack man quite
unprovoked. They do a great deal of damage to plantations. The
Mandingos, by-the-bye, have horses similar in appearance to the native
breeds of Nigeria. Occasionally one of these horses finds its way
down to the coast in Liberia, but, as a rule, the few horses one meets
with at Liberian coast towns have been brought by sea from French
Guinea (Konakri). It is an important fact, however, of great nega-
tive value, that apparently there is no Nagana or tsetse fly disease in
Liberia. No doubt there are one or more species of Glossina related

to the tsetse fly, but they do not carry the celebrated tsetse disease
io horses and cattle.

The principal and remarkable animals of the Liberian forest region
are, among antelopes, the handsomest of the Tragelaphs, the bongo.
LIBERIA. 9538

This splendid animal, good specimens of which are to be seen in the
Natural History Museum, at South Kensington, is almost the largest
in size of the Tragelaphs, being exceeded only by the eland. It is
magnificently colored bright chestnut red, with a few points of black,
and bold white stripes and bars. It seems to be fairly common in the
Liberian forests, which also conceal in their recesses curious develop-
ments of the cephalophine antelopes, or duykers. These duykers in
other parts of Africa are usually associated with the idea of a very
smal] antelope; but in Liberia there is the widespread Cephalophus
sylvicultrix, which is nearly the size of a small cow, and Cephalophus
jentincki, which is about the size of a fallow deer, with short stout
horns. Besides several small types of duyker there is the tiniest of
ell the antelopes—the royal antelope—not so large as a hare; and
there is the beautiful zebra antelope, which is bright yellow bay
boldly marked with bold black stripes, a most unusual coloration in
this group. The buffalo of the forest region is the red-haired, dwarf,
short-horned buffalo. The ordinary big hippopotamus is said to be
present in the lower Kavalli River, but Liberian streams and forests
wre for the most part frequented by the pigmy hippopotamus, an
animal which probably extends its range from the interior of Sierr:
Leone to the French Ivory Coast. Before I leave the question of the
fauna I should like to mention that, in addition to there being ap-
parently no Glossina fly to spread the tsetse disease, there is a great
relief in other directions from the ordinary insect pests of Africa.
Mosquitoes are very seldom met with. In fact, they seem to be
entirely absent from much of the forest region. Nor are white ants
very common or destructive in the centers of population:

The human population of Liberia consists of the following ele-
ments, which may be divided first of all into indigenes and Americo-
Liberians. The former number something like 2,000,000 and the lat-
ter between 12,000 and 15,000. So far as the outside world is con-
cerned, the world of treaties and congresses, the country which we
know as Liberia is considered to belong to and be governed by this
small caste of English-speaking negroes and half-breeds of American
origin. These English-speaking negroes certainly govern and ad-
minister the coast line and a belt of more or less settled country which
extends from 20 to 40 miles inland. Of late years they have been on
generally friendly terms with the 2,000,000 indigenous negroes, some
of whom have come very much under their influence.

The Americo-Liberians are the survivors or the descendants of
freed slaves or persons dissatisfied with their social condition in the
United States of America during the early part of the nineteenth cen-
tury. <A considerable number of them also came from the British
West Indies; but the movement which founded Liberia—the black
Republic on the west coast of Africa—originated with certain philan-

De LIBERIA.

ihropic societies in the United States about 1821. The idea, however.
in its genesis was the outcome of that still earher movement in Great
Britain which led to the formation of Sierra Leone. When British
philanthropy inthe eighteenth century was awakened to the injustice
of the slave trade and the unhappy condition of many of the runaway
slaves or freed negroes in the West Indies or in British America, it
was decided to repatriate a number of these people, and for that pur-
pose (possibly also with an eye to the main chance in securing for
Great Britain one of the few good natural harbors on the west coast
of Africa—Seirra Leone) a settlement was formed on the site of the
modern Free Town, without overmuch regard to the feelings or rights
of the local inhabitants. In the same way, when it was decided in the
United States to found a home for the repatriated African, the prior
experiment of Sierra Leone turned attention toward the same coast,
and in 1821 and at subsequent dates settlements were effected, firstly
at Monrovia, and later on at Roberts Port, Grand Basa, Sino, and
Harper (Cape Palmas). Usually those who conducted the enterprise
went through the form of buying small plats of land from local head-
men or chiefs; but, as a rule, the promoters of this movement did not
trouble overmuch about the rights of the “ bush niggers,” as the indig-
enous natives were termed. Consequently the first fifty years of the
history of Liberia were marked by constant struggles between the
Americo-Liberian invaders and the native blacks. During the last
ten years, however, there has been a marked advance in good rela-
tions between the American settlers and their native subjects, as many
of them may fairly be called. The wise policy of President Barclay
has greatly promoted this good feeling since 1904. He has been able
to assemble at different times at the capital chiefs or their represent-
atives from almost all parts of Liberia, even from the Mandingo dis-
tricts just beyond the limits of the coast belt. Therefore they have
no subject of disagreement. Curiously enough one example of this
mild rule of black by black is that the white man in Liberia is every-
where received with great friendliness, because he is not associated in
the minds of the natives with anything like conquest or oppression.
How far the original experiment will succeed the next twenty
years will, perhaps, indicate. The negroes of American origin who
have settled in Liberia have not, as a general rule, been able to stand
the climate very much better than Europeans, and, as a rule, they
have not been able to rear large families of children. Yet it seems to
me as though Liberians of the new generation born in the country are
beginning to take hold, but this is partly due to the increasing and
T think very sensible practice of intermarriage with women of the fine,
vigorous, indigenous races. Probably the future of Liberia will be a
negro state very like Sierra Leone in its development, with English as
its government language, and such English or American institutions
LIBERIA. 955

as may prove to be suited to an African country, a coast belt inhabited
by negroes professing Christianity and wearing clothes of European
cut, and a hinterland of Mohammedans dressed in the picturesque and
wholly suitable costume worn at the present day by the Mandingos
and by mest Mohammedan negroes between Senegal and the White
Nile.

The native races of Liberia, the languages they speak, and the
religions they profess may, to a certain extent, be grouped under two
classes—the Mandingo on the one hand and the Kru negro on the
other. Iam aware, of course, that the Mandingo type is a very vari-
able one physically, according to the less or greater degree of Cau-
‘asian blood which permeates its negro stock, and also that the Kru
man proper is confined in his distribution to a small portion of the
southern coast of Liberia. But each of these types is sufficiently
representative to serve as a general illustration of the two classes of
Liberian peoples. Associated with the Mandingos, to a great extent
in language, in Mohammedan religion, and in the adoption of the
Arab dress, are the Vai and the Gora of western Liberia, and to some
extent the Buzi or Kimbuza. All the remaining tribes are more or
less related to the Kru stock in language, appearance, physique, cus-
toms, and the profession of a pagan and fetishistic religion, similar
in general features to the fetish religions of all western and west
central Africa, with some points of resemblance to the Bantu beliefs
in the southern half of Africa. The Gora language of western
Liberia is rather a puzzle in classification, and it must be admitted
that it only offers the slightest affinity to the Mandingo group and
an equally slender connection with the Kru family. In a still more
generalized way it may be said that there are distant resemblances
between the languages of the Kru and Mandingo stocks; nor can
these slight resemblances be altogether explained by the mere imposi-
tion of linguistic influences. The Mandingos, who are destined to
play a most important part in the development of Liberia and of
much of West Africa, are nothing but a varying degree of cross
between the Fula race of the West African park lands and the ordi-
nary West African negro. This crossing and the founding of this
group of people—the correct pronunciation of whose name seems to
be Mading’a, or Manding’a—may have been a relatively ancient one.
The Mandingos, in fact, are the Swahilis of West Africa and offer a
striking resemblance in face to the average type of Swahili porter
that one meets with on the Zanzibar coast. They also often resemble
natives of Uganda, and for the same reason—that a good deal of the
population of Uganda is infused with a slight Hamitic element
derived from the Hima aristocracy. Several Mandingos whom I
met at Monrovia were able to speak Arabic in a halting fashion.
The Arab words they understood best were those pronounced in the

256 LIBERIA.

North African dialect. It seems to me that in some cases the Cau-
casian element in the Mandingos was derived from direct intermix-
ture of Berbers and Arabs from North Africa with the negroes of
the Upper Niger. I doubt if any pure-blooded Fula people extend
their range into the northern limits of Liberia; but they have had
an undoubted influence in times past over the development of the
park land which hes beyond the forest. By their minglings with the
indigenous negroes of the Sudanese and West African type they have
created the Mandingo peoples and have also carried Mohammedan
eivilization and tenets into that part of Africa, as well as, no doubt,
the Sudanese breeds of cattle and sheep. The domestic sheep of all
the forest region of Liberia is that common to the other forested parts
of West Africa—the sheep with erect ears, fairly well-developed
horns, small size, black and white coloring, a tail without any fatty
development, and a long throat mane in the male. Far back in the
interior of Liberia I am informed that the Mandingo sheep are simi-
lar to those of the Sudan, with fat tails and without the throat mane.

It should hardly come within the lmits of the present paper to
discuss one of the most interesting problems in Africa—the origin
of the Fula race. Personally I am still disposed toward the old
theory that the Fulas were an early cross between the Libyans of
North Africa and the negroes of Senegal, a cross in which the Cau-
casian element predominated considerably. They certainly offer
marked resemblances, however, to the Hamitic aristocracy of the
Upper Nile and the lake regions. Their language is a coniplete
puzzle. At present it can not be said to offer affinities of a marked
kind to any group of negro speech, but it is emphatically a negro
tongue (with a faint suggestion here and there of the Bantu family),
and not in any way influenced by Hamitic, Libyan, or Semitic char-
acteristics. As to the Libyan affinities of Hausa there can be no
doubt, but nothing of the kind has as yet been discerned in the strue-
ture or vocabulary of the Fulfulde. It even seems to offer less resem-

blances in structure to the Hamitic language family, for example,
than can be discerned in the Bantu.

Of all the peoples in Liberia affiliated with the Kru stock perhaps
the most numerous group is that of the Kru, which occupies the coast
of Liberia between the French frontier at the Kavalli River and the
river Sestos. With the Kru I associate the Grebo, as the two peoples
differ but little in language and scarcely at all in physical type. The
Grebos are inclining strongly toward Christianity, but very few, if
any, converts to that religion have been made among the Kru people
proper who inhabit the coast between Greenville and Garraway.
Krus and Grebos together number something like 375,000. The next

dingos, of whom there are perhaps 300,000 within the limits of Libe-

ria. After them may be ranked the Kpwesi people, a general term
for a congeries of tribes speaking dialects of a common language.
These Kpwesi (familiarly known by the Americo-Liberians as Pessi,
or Pessa) may be as many as 250,000. In an appendix to this paper
the rest of the tribes and their approximate numbers are enumerated.

In the central parts of Liberia, within the limits of the forest, there
is no doubt that cannibalism prevails. This is a very marked feature
in the life of the Beila, or Bele. These people are said to relish most
keenly the hands and feet, and this very dainty dish is usually set
before a king or chief alone. Nowhere in Liberia have I noticed—nor
has any explorer encountered or reported—any race of negroes wholly
naked, either among men or women, such as are so commonly met
with in eastern Equatorial Africa, or until a few years ago in parts of
South Central Africa. A certain degree of complete nudity in un-
married women was at one time quite a common feature of the natives
of the Niger delta, the Cross River, and the Kamerun, while on the
upper Cross River complete nudity among the men was just beginning
to disappear twenty years ago. Throughout Liberia no one has ever
observed complete nudity among either men or women. Though
there are a few rare exceptions to this rule, it may generally be ob-
served that the marked feature of male nudity so characteristic of the
Upper Nile, the eastern equatorial regions, and originally of the north
end of Lake Nyassa and central Zambezia, is never met with in the for-
ested regions of Africa, except possibly here and there among the
Pigmies. Throughout the Kongo basin and countries as completely
savage as the innermost parts of Liberia, the men wear a minimum of
clothing, which is a concession to ideas of decency, and which, when
the race is quite out of touch with the trade of the outer world, is gen-
erally a strip of bast (bark cloth) from a fig tree. I have not ob-
served any of the savages from the interior of Liberia wearing dressed
skins. I am told that so greedy are they after food that when any
beast is killed the hide is roasted and eaten. On the other hand, the
civilized Mandingos of the north have learned from the Fulas or from
the Moors, or possibly from both, the most beautiful work in leather.

Nowhere along the coast of Liberia is there a harbor in the sense
of the bay at Sierra Leone. All the anchorages, in fact, are open
roadsteads. But on the other hand, this is not a particularly danger-
ous condition for ships, as the south wind never blows strongly

enough to raise a big sea, while the north wind, coming from off the
land, can only affect the Atlantic at some distance from the shore.
But of course this portless condition adds very much to the discom-
fort of dealings with Liberia. Although the swell from the choppy
surface raised by the wind may not be sufficiently serious to affect big
vessels lying at anchor, it is not at all nice for small boats or steam
launches, and generally during the rainy season of the year transfer-
258 LIBERIA.

ence from the big steamer to the shore-going boat has to be effected
by means of a crane and a cradle. Still more to be dreaded on some
points on the coast is the landing or the going off on account of the
surf. Perhaps the best approach to a sheltered harbor which exists
is at the capital, Monrovia. Here there is a bar to a small river or
creek which communicates with the St. Pauls River. The bar is very
seldom rough, being to a certain extent sheltered by a promontory,
and once across the bar you can land quite comfortably on the beach
in perfectly smooth water. But at places like Grand Basa, Sind, and
Cape Palmas, the landing can be extremely dangerous and disagree-
able. One seldom arrives at or departs from these places without, at
any rate, a wetting from the rollers that break over the stern or bow
of the boat. However, real accidents to persons or property are, it
must be confessed, of rare occurrence, and the whole question depends
very much on the good or ill will of the Kru boys who direct the
steering.

The Kavalh River, though probably less in volume than the St.
Pauls, is the most navigable as a means of access to the interior.
Unfortunately there is a very bad bar at the mouth of the Kavalli or
it would have played a very different part in the history of West
Africa. Once across the bar, a steam launch or a rowing boat can
ascend the river for about 80 miles, when the first rapids are reached.
The upper Kavalli is imperfectly known, and, indeed, its extreme
upper course is still a matter of conjecture. On the definition of its
course depends to a great extent the laying down of the northeastern
frontier of Liberia according to the French treaty of 1892.

The St. Pauls River is only navigable as far as a place called
White Plains, about 20 miles from the mouth. There is no difficulty
about the bar at the mouth of the St. Pauls, for this reason, that one
can land with little or no risk at Monrovia; and once inside the
Mesurado River (which is merely a creek), one can embark on a small
‘river steamer, of which there are two or three in existence, enter
the St. Pauls River by the Stockton Creek, and thence ascend the
St. Pauls to the first rapids near the settlement known as White
Plains. All the lower part of the St. Pauls River is pretty thick with
Americo-Liberian settlements, some of them of a distinctly prosperous
and prepossessing appearance. Several of the officials at Monrovia
have country houses on the banks of the St. Pauls amid charming
surroundings. This great virtue may be attributed to the Americo-
Liberians, that they certainly know how to build houses, comely in
appearance, sanitary, and lasting, or as reasonably durable as one
ean expect in a land of heat and moisture. In fact, the leading char-
acteristics of the Americo-Liberians are their love of building and
their remarkable politeness.
LIBERIA. 259

For some distance above its first rapids the St. Pauls River is
scarcely navigable for canoes; but in the little-known region north of
Dobhi Zulu Island, it is said to be navigable for canoes up to its
junction with the Tuma, which is also stated to be an important
stream.

Eastward of Monrovia, the Mesurado River or Creek reaches, as a
navigable piece of water, to within a very short distance of the Junk
Creek, which is a branch of the Dukwia River; so that, except for a
little isthmus of sandy soil, Monrovia might be situated at the western
extremity of a long island. With developments that might come later
on, 1t would be very easy to cut a canal to join the Mesurado and the
Junk rivers. This would then give access for vessels of light draft
to the Dukwia and Farmington rivers. These streams debouch at
a settlement of some importance named Marshall; but the bar at
Marshall (mouth of the river Junk) is extremely bad and dangerous.
Asa matter of fact, with a very little expenditure of money Monrovia
might be made a good port.

The population of Monrovia, so far as Americo-Liberians and for-
elgners are concerned, is about 2,500. It has a system of telephones
which connects it with the settlements on the St. Pauls River. This
has been set up and is well worked by a native Liberian. It is, per-
haps, hardly necessary to remind you that Monrovia was named
after the celebrated President of the United States, Monroe, who is
responsible for that doctrine which inhibits any European nation
from further conquests in the New World. The capital of Liberia is
divided into two parts, the low and shoreward section being given
over to large settlements of Kru boys and indigenous negroes, while
the upper part of the town is inhabited by Americo-Liberians and
European consuls, traders, etc. This civilized part of the town is
composed of broad, grass-grown streets, and substantial, well-built,
comely looking houses, churches, offices, and public buildings. The
smart appearance of the houses, in fact, is in somewhat striking con-
trast to the neglected condition of the roads. These have never been
made, and are simply the unleveled rock of more or less flat surface.
Consequently at the present time they are absolutely unsuited to any
vehicle, though I have seen an enterprising Liberian negotiate them
with a bicycle. They are generally covered with a very short, close
turf of thickly growing plants, which is kept in the condition
of turf by the constant nibbling of the pretty little cattle that
frequent the streets of Monrovia. A less agreeable feature are the
pigs, which exist in great numbers and perform the office of scaven-
gers. The appearance of most of the houses is, as I have said, either
very striking or comely both in form and color, and this appearance
is enhanced by the beautiful clumps of trees and the gardens which
surround most of the houses. The Americo-Liberians seem to be
260 LIBERIA.

very fond of flowers, and have gardens full of roses, oleanders, alle-
mandas, bougainvillia, and frangipani in constant bloom. There are
numerous churches and a masonic hall.

There is a good deal of civilization and comfort and signs of prog-

gress at the settlements, which are grouped together under the gen-
eral name of Grand Basa, and also at the Sino towns, the principal of
which is named Greenville. But perhaps, on the whole, the most
go-ahead and energetic assemblage of Americo-Liberians is to be
found at Harper (Cape Palmas). Here there is a philosophical
society, which is doing a good work in collecting and printing statis-
tics about Liberia. But Harper, unfortunately for Europeans, is a
good deal more unhealthy than Monrovia.
Compared with other parts of West Africa, I should say that
Liberia is less unhealthy for the European than Sierra Leone, the
Ivory coast, the Gold coast, or Lagos. But it is, perhaps, too soon to
judge. It is noteworthy, however, that the remarkable absence of
mosquitoes should to a great extent coincide with a less marked prev-
alence of malarial fevers.

From the European point of view, perhaps the most healthy part
of Liberia is the northern half, and from all accounts it would be the
Mandingo plateau that Europeans would prefer for their trading or
mining settlements.

The great undoubted wealth of Liberia hes, as I have already
pointed out, in its rubber, but the trade in this product is as yet only
in its infaney. Another important article of export in the future
will be timber. Piasava, which is a fiber derived from the rind of
the fronds of a Raphia palm, figures to some extent in the exports,
which also include coffee, a little cacao, ivory, copal, palm oil, palm
kernels, ginger, camwood, and annatto.

.

The approximate total coast population of “ civilized’ Liberians (mostly
Christian, and of mixed American and indigenous negro races) amounts to
40,000. The “ Liberian” community, therefore, at the present time amounts to
a population in the coast region of about 50,000 in number.

There are a good many other native villages and small isolated settlements
or farms of Americo-Liberians which it would be tedious to enumerate by
name. The ones and twos in such scattered settlements as these (such as Fish
Town, Puduke, Weabo, Pequenino Ses, etc.) may be taken as a set-off against
any possible exaggeration of numbers in connection with the more populous
places.

These Americo-Liberians at present constitute the governing caste of the
country. In origin about two-thirds are from the United States of America and
one-third from the British West Indies. It is curious that in a general way
the men who have come most to the front in the history of Liberia have been
of British West Indian descent rather than emigrants or descendants of emi-
grants from the United States. They came, or their ancestors came, to Liberia
rather to seek a profitable field for their enterprise than in any attempt to flee
from conditions of slavery or other kinds of unsatisfactory social environment.
The Liberians of British West Indian origin have generally been removed one
or eyen two generations from a condition of slavery. They are also for the
most part better educated and remember more as to their actual African origin
than is the case with those whose immediate ancestors have come from the
United States. For instance, the present President of Liberia, the Hon. Arthur
Barclay, knows that the negro stock from which he sprang came from the dis-
trict of Popo, now on the borderland of French and German territory, in the
western part of the Dahome coast. English is naturally the universal language
used by the Americo-Liberians. It is variously spoken by them, those origi-
nally of United States origin speaking it with a very strong “American” accent,
while the Liberians who have sprung from the British West Indies talk
English—that is to say, educated persons do—with but slight accent, and in
the case of those who have received additional education in England, with no
very obvious accent at all. A good deal of connection in sentiment is still kept
up with the United States, though perhaps there is an increasing tendency, so
far as higher education is concerned, for the dispatch of young Liberians to
study in Hngland at such places as the Liverpool schools and the African
Training Institute of Colwyn Bay. But several local educational institutes are
generously maintained by American philanthropists. The station of Arthing-
ton, on the St. Pauls River, is named after the celebrated philanthropist of
that name connected with Leeds (Yorkshire), who did so much to establish the
first missionary steamers on the Kongo, and whose name is very gratefully
remembered in Liberia for the assistance that he has given in educational work.

The indigenous population of Liberia, not of extraneous origin, may be esti-
mated with some correctness at a total of about 2,160,000. [In Vol. II, pp.
884-901, of his book on “ Liberia,’ New York, 1906, Sir Harry Johnston gives
additional information about the native races, estimating the population at
2,000,000.] They may be enumerated as follows:

“Tt is probable that the total population of the various Mandingo tribes considerably
exceeds this estimate, which is arrived at by putting together the computations of each
separate branch as given to me by its representatives at Monrovia. The proper pronun-
ciation of the well-known tribal name Mandingo appears to be ‘‘ Manding’a,” or
““Mading’a.”” They are a race that will play a very notable part in the development of
West Africa. The whole of this tribe, which populates the hinterland of Liberia, parts
of Sierra Leone, and the southern part of the French ‘‘ Sudan,” must number one or
two millions. Their language is harmonious in sound and simple and logical in con-
struction, therefore easily acquired. They are Mohammedanrs to a very great extent,
only a few branches in the Liberian hinterland remaining pagan. In consequence they
dress picturesquely and suitably, like the majority of Mohammedanized Africans in the
Niger Basin and the nerthern Sudan, with wide breeches, voluminous tobes, and fezes,
or round skulleaps. They are a fine-looking race as regards physical development, and
their physiognomy reveals the secret of their power, namely, the slight infusion of
Caucasian blood. They are, in fact, the result of an early intermingling of the Berber
from the Sahara Desert with the negroes of the Niger Basin. They are a very indus-
trious people, with a remarkable feeling for art, which is at present confined to elaborate
leatherwork and the shaping of picturesque garments. The principal divisions of the
Mandingo race in the hinterland of Liberia—proceeding from west to east—are the fol-
lowing: Boporo, Kwang’a, Mwela, and Dukwira. Their towns are nearly always sur-
rounded by clay walls, the architecture of which, judging from such photographs as I
have seen, is strongly reminiscent of the towns of Nigeria.

The Americo-Liberians of course are Christians, velonging entirely to various
sections of the Protestant churches—Anglican, Methodist Episcopal, Metho-
dist, Baptist, Presbyterian, etc. There is one establishment at Monrovia of the
White Fathers, a Roman Catholic mission, mainly French and Dutch in the
nationality of its missionaries. So far the fathers have made no converts, but
the mission has only just been established. There is a good deal of activity
amongst the various missionary societies dependent on the Protestant churches
represented in Liberia, and this is largely financed from the United States of
America. The work is carried on almost invariably by missionaries haying
some proportion, large or small, of African blood in their veins. A good deal
of their work is educational, and has certainly brought solid advantages to
the coast negroes of Liberia. Outside the negroes of American origin there are
not many converts to Christianity. Such as there are come from the Kru
peoples and the Grebo principality. Perhaps of all the native races the Grebo
is the most Christianized and civilized. The Vai, some of the Gora, and nearly
all the Mandingo peoples are Mohammedan—not fanatically, but very genuinely
as regards adherence to Mohammedan precepts. The spread of Mohammedan-
ism in the western and northern districts of Liberia has been of immense bene-
fit to the country, diminishing the traffic in alcohol and checking drunkenness,
which elsewhere in Liberia is so common among the negroes—a drunkenness
induced just as often by the native forms of alcohol (palm wine, etc.) as by the
consumption of European spirits.

At the present time the ports of entry into the Liberian Republic at which
foreigners may settle and trade are the following (running from west to east) :
Roberts Port, Monrovia, Marshall, Grand Basa, Grand Ses (Cess), Greenville,
Nana Kru, Cape Palmas, and Kavalli. Foreigners also are allowed to trade
within a zone of 3 miles along all the inland frontiers of Liberia. It is, I
believe, the intention of the Liberian executive to add to these recognized
ports of entry places in the interior and on the coast as soon as communica-
tion has been opened up and the Liberian Government is in a position to main-
tain law and order at these places.

GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE TIBET MISSION.

By Sir. FRANK YOUNGHUSBAND, K. C. I. E.

Though I shall tell to-night of a journey to the “ Forbidden City,”
there is, I fear, little, strictly speaking, new that I shall have to say.
My companions and myself were, indeed, the first Europeans to enter
Lassa for many years. Still, we can not claim credit for having been
the first of all, and all I can do is to corroborate and emphasize the
work of former travelers, and especially of those hardy Indian ex-
plorers A-K, Sarat Chandra Das, and others, who had made such
careful surveys and interesting notes that some at least of our ob-
stacles were removed.

Such corroboration is, however, very necessary, for an impression
had of recent years grown up in Europe that Tibet was a wretched,
poor, inhospitable country; and this is not what those few travelers,
European and Indian, who had been to Lhasa before had described,
nor is it actually the case. The northern part of Tibet, which is all
that recent European travelers have seen, is indeed barren, unculti-
vated, and worthless, and this forms quite two-thirds of the whole.
But Tibet is a large country—as large as the provinces of Bombay,
Madras, and the Punjab put together, and there is a third part still
remaining which is remarkably well cultivated, which is dotted over
with thriving villages and the well-built and comfortable residences
of the Tibet gentry. Taking it as a whole, then, and excluding the
worthless desert portion, Tibet is probably fully as rich as Kashmir
or Nepal. The valleys in which Lassa, Gyantse, and Shigatse are
situated, and the valley of the Brahmaputra, are neither barren
plateaus nor yet narrow V-shaped gorges. They are flat valleys
from 4 or 5 to as much as 10 miles broad, covered with good soil, well
irrigated, and richly cultivated. This is the most important geo-
graphical fact which, though mentioned casually by former travelers,
we are able to reestablish and confirm.

And with this fact clearly impressed upon your minds, Jet me now
ask you to follow in the footsteps of the Tibet mission in its Journey

from India to Lassa. We unfortunately had to take our bodies there,
and for the human body Tibet and Sikkim, through which we had to
pass on the way into Tibet, are at certain seasons anything but
attractive. You, however, need go there in mind only, and for the
mind I do not know, in the whole realm of nature, any greater glories
than Sikkim and Tibet afford. At the very outset of our travels was
the sight which in all the world I consider the supreme—the view of
Kinchenjunga from Darjiling, described by many travelers before,
but by none better than by Mr. Douglas Freshfield in his recent book
on this region. We had then to pass through as superb tropical for-
ests as are anywhere to be met with, and emerging onto the high
Tibetan tableland it was our good fortune to live for a month in full
view of the magnificent panorama of 150 miles of the highest peaks in
the Himalayas, with the loftiest mountain in the world as the culmi-
nating object. Lastly, we had ever before us in the dim mysterious
distance the Sacred City, of which so little was known, and entrance to
which was barred by every obstacle which man and nature could
raise; and while my military companions had constantly to think of
how best to overcome the resistance we might encounter, we of the
political service had continually with us the earnest desire and the
ambition to lessen by all our powers of reasoning and persuasion the
military resistance, and above all so to impress the people who were
now first making our acquaintance, that on our departure their dispo-
sition toward us should be one of friendliness rather than hostility,
and that they should no longer look upon us as people to be roughly
and rigidly excluded, but on the contrary respected and welcomed.

What more inspiring task could any men be intrusted with? And
while this is not the place to speak of the military and political work
of the mission, I may at least say that our objects were attained, and I
may express my firm conviction that from this time onward all Kuro-
pean travelers will be the gainers for what the British mission to Lassa
did in 1904. One only evil geographical result I foresee. This soci-
ety will have one less destination for the adventurous explorers of
Great Britain, and the Sven Hedins of the future, like a fast-expiring
‘ace, will be driven back and back till they finally vanish from the
earth amid the arctic snows. But for this misfortune not we only are
to blame, but also and chiefly one of your own gold medalists, the
great Viceroy of India, to whose initiative the whole enterprise was
due and without whose constant support it could scarcely have been
brought to a conclusion so disastrous for future explorers.

Our start from Darjiling in June, 1903, was miserable enough.
The monsoon was just bursting, the rain was coming down in cata-
acts, and all was shrouded in the densest mist. Few knew of the
enterprise upon which I was embarking, but a little knot of strangers
who had assembled in the porch of the hotel had got an inklhng and
GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE TIBET MISSION, 267

shouted “ Good luck!” as I rode off, covered with waterproofs, into
the mist to join my companions, Mr. White and Captain O’Connor,
in Sikkim. And detestable though the rain was, there was still a
large surplus of joy in riding through those wonderful Sikkim forests,
day after day seeing fresh marvels of forest growth or, flowery
beauty. The mountain sides were everywhere a wealth of tropical
vegetation, rich and luxuriant. And here under the shade of the
mighty giants of the forest grew the stately tree ferns, often 40 or 50
feet in height, with fronds 10 or 12 feet long. All were in bright
fresh foliage, and besides ferns of every graceful form and of the
subtlest delicacy of tracery were variegated colored plants, like cal-
ladiums, and closely connecting all together and festooned from
tree to tree were creepers of every size, from the great elephant
creeper, whose leaves resembled elephant’s ears, to light trailing
vinelike tendrils lightly strung from bough to bough; while here
and there, as some bright surprise, the eye would light upon the most
perfect orchid, or other flowery marvel, which brought one to a halt
in an eestasy of enjoyment. Nor should I omit to mention the bril-
lant butterflies glinting past on every side. Seventeen different
kinds did I count in the space of 200 yards in the Teesta Valley;
and in few other places in the world are to be found such a variety
of rare butterflies, so many different orchids, and such a wealth of
trees and flowers as in Sikkim. There are, I believe, over 600 dif-
ferent orchids alone to be found here and over 60 separate kinds of
rhododendron. |

Fain would I dwell longer on the attractions of this wonderful
country, but it is with Tibet itself that we are chiefly concerned
to-night, and thither I must without delay transport you. Just cross
one pass and all is changed. On the far side of the Kongra-lama
Pass not a tree is to be seen. If in some secluded nook a plant a foot
high is met with, it is a curiosity. In place of the deep-cut valleys of
Sikkim there are great plains 10 or 12 miles wide. The sky is cloud-
less, and the view extended over many and many a mile. Here at
Khamba Jong Mr. White had laid out a camp, and here we spent
many delightful months, doing our best to bring to reason a people
nearly as obstinate as ourselves, and between whiles making roving
expeditions to distant valleys—geological investigations with Mr.
Hayden, of the geological survey; botanical trips with Doctor Prain,
of the Botanical Gardens in Calcutta; natural history expeditions
with Captain Walton, I. M. S.; every day and every hour enjoying
the charming summer climate, and, above all, the unrivaled panorama
of the mighty Himalayas at the very culminating point of their
grandeur, where all the loftiest peaks in the world were majestically
arrayed before us. Captain Ryder, known to you for his journey in
China, surveyed and measured all this wonderful region, and will,

J trust, before long give you full particulars of his surveys. But
who will ever be able to adequately describe the fascination of that
glorious range of mountains? From sunrise to sunset the days were
a continual dehght. As-I looked out of my tent in the early morn-
ing, while all below was still wrapped in a steely gray, far away in
the distance the first streaks of dawn would be just gilding the snowy
summits of Mount Everest, poised high in heaven as the spotless pin-
nacle of the world. By degrees the whole great snowy range would
be illuminated and shine out in dazzling, unsullied whiteness. Then
through all the day it would be bathed in ever-varying hues of blue
and purple till the setting sun clothed all in a final intensity of glory,
and left one hungering for daylhght to appear again.

And all was rendered doubly interesting from the history of its
geological past, which Mr. Hayden was able to describe to me. He
was indeed enraptured with the district from the geological stand-
point, and a bed of fossil oysters he discovered there had more fas-
cination for him than Lassa itself. He was able, from the oysters,
to accurately determine the age of the hills in this part of Tibet.
According to him they were * recent ”—that is to say, not more than
two or three million years old, and the main axis of the Himalayas
was thoroughly modern, perhaps not more than a few hundreds of
thousands of years old. In what to geologists are really ancient
times Tibet was below a sea which washed around the base of the
Himalayas—a mighty granite ridge which is constantly being pro-
truded upward from the interior of the earth and ever being worn
away by the snowfall on its summit. Never have I been able to see
nature at work on such a mighty scale as here, and when the scien-
tifie results of Mr. Hayden’s work in this region have been thor-
oughly investigated I feel sure they will prove of the highest interest
and value.

The mission remained at Khamba Jong from July 7 to December 6,
but long before the latter date we had discovered that our political
objects would never be obtained until we advanced farther into the
country. A move on to Gyantse was accordingly ordered, and, as a
considerable body of troops under the command of General Macdon-
ald was to escort the mission, the line of advance was changed onto
the Chumbi route.

Winter was now on us, and the difficulties which General Macdon-
wld and his troops had to contend with can hardly be realized in
England. But not even the rigors of » Tibetan winter were able to
stop the advance of the little force of British and Indian troops.

Early in December we crossed the Jelap la and descended into the
Chumbi Valley. At Yatung, the trade mart established under the old
convention, a wall had some years ago been erected to exclude our
trade, and beyond this our traders had so far never been allowed to

GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE TIBET MISSION. 269

pass. As we debouched on a bright frosty morning from the pine
torest in which we had encamped for the night, we saw this wall built
right across the road and high up the mountain side on either hand.
Whether we should have to fight our way through or whether the
Tibetan general would respond to the arguments I had used the pre-
vious day and gracefully allow us through had yet to be proved, and
General Macdonald used every military precaution. But to our re-
lief we saw the great door in the tower standing open, and we were
soon passing peaceably through the gate of Tibet, never, I hope, to
be closed against us again.

We then emerged on to the main Chumbi Valley, which, though
not wide and open like the valleys we afterwards saw in Tibet proper,
is decidedly less steep and narrow than the Sikkim Valley. Both in
the valley bottom and on the hillsides there was room enough for
comfortable villages and cultivated fields. The people were very
well to do, and, what was more satisfactory from our point of view,
decidedly well disposed. They soon showed themselves to be keen
traders, and must have made large fortunes out of us during last year.
They are not true Tibetans, but are called Tomos. Nor is their val-
Jey, which is on the Indian side of the watershed, considered a part
of Tibet proper, which is looked upon as extending only as far as the
mouths of steep gorges we a few days later passed through in the up-
per part of the valley. The rainfall is only about half that of Dar-
jiling, and the climate in general much superior.

The mission remained three weeks in Lower Chumbi, while mili-
tary preparations for a further advance were being made, and then in
the very depth of winter, on January 8, we crossed the Tang-la,
15,200 feet high, on the Tibetan plateau again. Never shall I forget
that day. Reveille sounded at the first streak of dawn, and as I
looked out of my tent the very spirit of frost seemed to have settled
on the scene. The stars were shooting out sharp, clean rays from the
clear steely sky. Behind the great rugged peak of Chumalhari the
first beams of dawn were showing out, but with no force yet to cheer
or warm, and only sufficient light to make the cold more apparent.
Buckets of water were, of course, frozen solid. The remains of last
night’s dinner were a hard, solid mass. The poor Sikhs were just
crawling out of their tents, so shriveled with the cold it looked as
though if they shriveled much more there would be nothing left of
them. The thermometer stood at 18° below zero, or just 50° of frost,
and though this is not considered much in Canada and Siberia, and
T dare say those who have just returned from the Antarctic would
consider it pleasantly warm, I should remind you that 50° of frost
‘at a height of 15,000 feet above sea level is a very different thing from
50° of frost- on the sea level. At 15,000 feet where the effort of
breathing is a continual drain upon one’s strength, the mere weight

of the heavy clothes one has to wear in cold weather is a sufficient
strain in itself. Any additional effort exhausts one immediately.
And if it tries us Europeans, who are more or less inured to cold,
how much more distressing must it be to the natives of India, and
that they were able to march 15 miles across the pass that day and
spend the rest of the winter, as they had to, immediately on the other
side, at a height of but little under 15,000 feet, is, I think, a striking
testimony to their powers of endurance and the high spirit which
prevails among them. Colonel Hogge and the Twenty-third Pio-
neers most willingly faced this ordeal, and by this act of endurance
proved once and for all to the Tibetans that their country was no
longer inaccessible to us, even in the depth of winter.

Here at Tuna more fruitless parley with the Tibetans ensued.
They paid one or two visits to me, and once 1 rode over with Captains
O’Connor and Sawyer to see them amid their own surroundings, to
gauge their capacity, and to estimate the strength and direction of
the various influences at work among them. It became sufficiently
evident to us that the real control of affairs was in the hands of the
Lassa lamas, three of whom—one from each of the three great mon-
asteries at Lassa—were present on the occasion. The four generals
whom we then met were amiable and polite enough. They repeated
by rote the formula, ‘“ Go back to the frontier.” But the impetus to
obstruct came from the three lamas, who, with scowls on their faces,
remained seated on the ground, showing not the slightest signs of
civility or ordinary politeness, and instigating the generals to detain
us in the Tibetan camp till we would name a definite date for with-
drawal. When I think of their rabid fanatical obstruction on that
eceasion and compare it with the almost cordial reception we subse-
auently had in all the great monasteries and in the most sacred shrines
before we left Lassa, I can not help feeling that we went a long way
toward breaking down that barrier of exclusion which, set up by the
lamas for their own selfish ends, has kept away from us a people
who, when left to themselves, showed every inclination to be on
friendly terms with us and indulge their natural instinct for trading.

But parleying with the Tibetans occupied only an insignificant part
of my time at Tuna, and I had ample leisure to enjoy the magnificent
natural scenery around us.. Immediately before us was an almost
level and perfectly smooth gravel plain, which gave a sense of space
and freedom, and on the far side of the plain, 10 or 12 miles distant,
rose the superb range of mountains which forms the main axis of the
Himalayas and the boundary between Tibet and Bhutan. They were
an unceasing joy to me, and the sight of them alone was ample reward
for all the hardships we had to endure. The sun would strike our
tents at about 7 in the morning. The sky would generally then
be cloudless save for a long soft wisp of gauze-like haze, and perhaps

a few delicate streaks of pink or golden cloud poised motionless on
the horizon. And the great snowy mountains, in the early morning
when I used to go out and watch them, instead of being sharp, clear,
and cold, would be veiled in that blue, hazy, dreamy indistinctness
which makes the view of Kinchenjunga from Darjiling so marvel-
ously beautiful and the hard stern mountains as ethereal as fairy-
land. The bare brown of the base of the mountains was toned down
into exquisite shades of purple and pink, while the white of the
snowy summits shaded softly into the cerulean of the sky above. On
the plain, plump little larks and finches would be scurrying about in
search of food. Now and then a little vole would be seen basking in
the sun at the mouth of his hole. And over all there reigned a sense
of peace and quiet which made it hard to believe that only 10 miles
off five of the highest lamas in Tibet were solemnly cursing us and
publishing to the people round threats of attack upon our camp.

Nor was every day, nor the whole of each day, of this same peace-
ful nature. Almost invariably at 10 or 11 a terrific wind would
arise and blow with fury for the rest of the day. Mighty masses
of cloud would come sweeping up from the direction of India. Snow
would sometimes fall, and then for two or three days together we
would be the sport of a terrific blizzard. The mountains would be
hidden and nothing would be visible but dull masses of fiercely driven
snow, as fine and dry as dust and penetrating everywhere. For days
together the thermometer would not rise above 15° even in the middle
of the day. Our camp would be the very picture of desolation. It
seemed impossible that the poor sentries at night would ever be able
to stand against the howling storm and the penetrating snow or
that our soldiers would ever be able to resist an attack from the
Tibetans under such terrific circumstances. ;

Then one morning we would find the snow clouds had passed away
from over us and see the great peak Chumalhari emerging calm,
strong, and irresistible from out of the mass of cloud still tossing
wildly round its base. Below all seemed chaos. It was difficult to
stand against the driving wind; the dust and the powdery snow
were still battling furiously around one and around the base of the
mountain, and the birds were driven hither and thither. But tow-
ering above all the tumult below, serene and majestic, and looking
prouder, loftier, and purer than ever, rose the great peak, reverenced
even by the unimaginative Tibetans, and above it lay the calm blue
sky, illimitable in its restfulness and light—a sky of bright and
liquid azure, through which one seemed able to pierce right into
heaven itself.

Throughout January, February, and March the bitter winds con-
tinned, often accompanied by snow in blinding blizzards, through
which the convoys and their escort had to force their way with per-
22 GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE TIBET MISSION.

haps even greater sufferings than fell to us. But gradually, as
week by week went by, the temperature rose. The military prepara-
tions in rear were completed by General Macdonald, and early in
April we marched down to Gyantse. Of the military incidents on
the way I will say nothing. It was the deepest disappointment to
me that fighting should have been necessitated, and the Tibetan
generals were as little anxious for it as I was, but they had impossible
orders from Lassa—orders not to fight, not to negotiate, and not to
let us proceed. Unless, therefore, we were prepared to abandon the
whole object of the mission, fighting was imevitable.

Arrived at Gyantse on April 11, we found a flat open valley 5 or
6 miles wide, dotted all over with flourishing hamlets and intersected
by numerous water channels. Round each hamlet, along the water
channels, and by the bed of the river were willow and poplar trees
just showing signs of bursting into foliage. The banks were covered
with masses of iris plants, which later on were to flower out into
sheets of purple. The piercing cold of the Tuna uplands was left
behind. There was only a shght touch of frost at night, while the
days were beautifully fine and bright; and we were looking forward
to a restful summer of peaceful negotiation, when suddenly ominous
clouds began to collect around us, and early on the morning of May
5 we were awoke by wild shouts and firing, and, looking out of our
dents, we saw Tibetans firing into us through a wall only 10 yards off.
Hoow Major Murray and his gurkhas warded off the attack; how
Colonel Brander defended the post for nearly two months against
the Tibetans, who had now invested us, and how General Macdonald
eventually returned with a relieving force, drove back the Tibetans,
and captured the jong, has been told elsewhere. Geographically, the
important point is that the refusal of the Tibetans to negotiate at
Gyantse necessitatedd our advance to Lassa. On July 14 we set out,
much impeded by heavy rain, and soon set aside the delusion that
Tibet is a rainless country. Well on till September we had frequent
rains, and the size of the rivers and side streams was quite sufficient
evidence that this part of Tibet receives—probably up the Brah-
maputra Valley—a quite considerable rainfall, say between 20 and 30
inches, at a rough guess.

We crossed the easy Karo-la Pass, about 16,000 feet, where Colonel
Brander had fought his gallant httle action early in May, and the
next day debouched on to the most lovely lake I have ever seen—the
Yamdok Tso. In shape it was like a rough ring, surrounding what
is practically an island; and in color it varied to very shade of
violet and turquoise blue and green. At times it would be the
blue of heaven, reflecting the intense Tibetan sky. Then, as some
cloud passed over it, or as, marching along, we beheld it at some
different angle, it would flash back rays of the deep greeny blue of

GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE TIBET MISSION, 23

a turquoise. Anon it would show out in various shades of richest
violet. Often, when overhead all was black with heavy rain clouds,
we would see a streak of brilliant light and color flashing from the
far horizon of the lake; while beyond it and beyond the bordering
mountains, each receding range of which was of one more beautiful
shade of purple than the last, rose once more the mighty axial range
of the Himalayas, at that great distance not harsh in their whitey
coldness, but softly tinted with a delicate blue, and shading away into
the exquisite azure of the sky. What caused the marvelous coloring
of this lake, which even the Tibetans call the turquoise lake, we could
none of us say. Perhaps it was its depth, perhaps it was its saline
character, or some chemical component of its water. But whatever
the main cause, one cause at least must have been the intensity of
clearness in the quid Tibetan sky, so deep and so translucent that
even the sky of Greece and Italy would look pale and thick beside it.

For three days we marched along the shores of this beautiful lake,
and then we ascended our last pass and looked down onto the Brah-
maputra River and almost upon Lassa itself. But the sacred city
was still left hid. Masses of mountains in range after range were all
we could see in that direction, and General Macdonald had still the
very serious obstacle of the Brahmaputra River, now in almost its
full flood, to overcome before we could reach our goal. The Brah-
maputra we found to be divided into numerous channels, but we
were able to cross it at a spot where it narrowed to 200 yards,
though not without the loss by drowning of the one officer to whom,
of all others in the force, our success in reaching Lassa was due—
Maj. G. H. Bretherton, the chief supply and transport officer. The
river rushed in whirling vortices past a cliff, from which Captain
Sheppard, R. E., suspended a wire rope to the opposite side and
upon it rigged up a flying ferry. The river valley was from 3 to 5
miles wide, and, like the Gyantse Valley, richly cultivated with wheat
and barley, dotted over with hamlets, monasteries, well-built and
comfortable residences of the great men of the country, and with
pleasant groves of poplar, walnut, and even a few peach and apricot
trees. The side valleys were also well cultivated, and the hillsides,
though bare of trees, were covered with grass, which should afford
excellent pasturage for many more sheep and goats than we actually
saw there. It was altogether a smiling prospect, and doubts as to
the possibility of being able to supply our troops with the necessaries
of life, for the year round if required, were at once removed.

I was now met by a variety of deputations, each one of increasing
weight and importance, and each more urgent than the last in beg-
ging me not to proceed to Lassa. The Dalai Lama himself even
wrote to me, an act of unprecedented condescension on his part, and
he sent his high chamberlain to say that if we went to Lassa his
274 GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE TIBET MISSION.

religion would be spoilt and he would die. I had to inform him, in
reply, of the delicate and painful position in which I was placed,
for if, on the one hand, I went on to Lassa I understood that his
holiness would die, while if I stayed where I was I would myself
cie, as I would undoubtedly have my head cut off if I failed to obey
the orders I had received and negotiate the treaty in Lassa itself.
reluctant as I was to cause the premature demise of the Dalai Lama,
I felt I had no alternative, I informed the high chamberlain, but to
proceed to Lassa.

Expectation was now at its height. Each corner we turned we felt
sure we should see Lassa. We hastened to the top of one rise after
another in the hopes of catching the first glimpse. The advance
patrols of mounted infantry, on their return, were eagerly questioned.
At length, on August 2, we rounded our last corner and saw the
golden roofs of the Potala of Lassa glittering in the distance, and on
the following day encamped beneath its walls.

Here in a lovely valley covered with trees, rich with cultivation,
and watered by a river as broad as the Thames at Westminster, here
hidden away by range after range of snowy mountains, lay the mys-
terious Forbidden City which no living European had seen before.
To many who had supposed, because it was so secluded, it must be a
kind of dreamland city, it was, I dare say, disappointing, for 1t was,
after all, built by men, and not by fairies. Its streets were not paved
with gold, nor were its doors of pearls. The streets were, indeed, hor-
ribly muddy, and the inhabitants less like fairies than any I have so
far seen.

But the Potala, the palace of the Grand Lama, was an imposing,
massive structure, very solidly built of masonry, and picturesquely
perched on a rocky eminence dominating the whole plain and the city
at its base. Numbers of the houses in the city were, too, well built and
solid, and often surrounded by shady trees. The rock-perched palace
and the strange city at its base would be striking anywhere, but set
in this beautiful valley, deep in the very heart of the mountains,
they gathered an additional impressiveness which all who saw them
recognized.

Tt was, however, more to the inhabitants than to their buildings
that I had to devote my chief attention during my stay in Lassa. All
the leading men, both lay and ecclesiastical, here came before me, and
with them I reasoned and argued and chaffed day after day and week
after week Appallingly ignorant and inconceivably unbusinesslike
they were. No one man had supreme authority or full responsibility
to negotiate with me. A council were supposed to be the chief execu-
(ive authorities, but they could do nothing without the consent of the
national assembly, and they, without any presiding officer to control
them or any sense of responsibility, simply censured instead of

indorsing what the executive council did, while these latter were pro-
hibited from attending meetings of the national assembly to argue
their case in person. A more hopelessly inapt organization for deal-
mg with a crisis in their foreign affairs it would be difficult to imag-
ine. But ignorant, bigoted, and apparently immovable as they were,
they had their good points. They were almost invariably polite, and
they were genial. The humblest little joke was enough to set them
off laughing, and I do not recall separating at the close of a single
interview of all the many we had at Lassa with any feeling of ill
temper. I must confess to a feeling of exasperation sometimes when
I reflected that my convention had to be got through in so short a
time, and no ray of daylight was for so long visible through the
dreary clouds of obstruction; but these poor Tibetans do deserve
credit for never having really irritated me. It was, after all, their
business to make as good a bargain as they could with me, and perti-
nacity 1s a trait which need not be caviled at. Still, it was heavy,
weary work. Eight or ten of them would come together. Each one
had to have his say, so that when he returned home he could boast
that he had for his part spoken up to the British commissioner.
“ach one I listened to patiently and each one I answered. In this
way, as every day produced a few fresh men, I worked through mest
of the leading men in Lassa, while Captain O’Connor, whose trials
were still greater than mine, tackled even larger numbers in his pri-
vate room.

On the whole, I formed a low estimate of their mental caliber. It is
impossible to regard them as much else than children. My talks with
them were not only about the business in hand, but about general
affairs and about religion. The Ti Rimpochi, with whom the Dalai
lama left his seal in his flight for Lassa a few days before our arrival,
held the chair of divinity in the Gaden monastery, and was universally
reverenced as the leading lama in Lassa. He was recognized as re-
gent, and was the principal in the negotiations with me. But even
he, pleasant, benevolent, genial old gentleman as he was, had really
very little intellectual power, and but a small modicum of spirituality.
In both he was very distinctly inferior to the ordinary Brahmin in
India. He liked his little jokes, and we were always on the best of
terms. But he was firmly convinced the earth was triangular. His
intellectual attainments did not amount to much more than a knowl-
edge by rote of prodigious quantities of verses from the sacred books.
Discussion with him upon the why or the wherefore of things ended
in bald quotations from the scriptures, and his religion chiefly con-
sisted in ceremonial. The general run of abbots of monasteries and
leading lamas had even less to recommend them. One monastery at
Lassa contained no less than 10,000 monks, and another had 7,000.
But I do not think anyone saw these monks without remarking what
276 GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE TIBET MISSION.

a degraded, nasty, sensual looking lot they were. It is altogether a
mistake to suppose that in Tibet is to be found a pure and lofty form
of Buddhism. Buddhism and Chinese civilization certainly have
raised the rough tribes who, six or seven centuries ago, inhabited
Tibet into something very much higher than they were before these
appeared. But intellectual and spirituat life is stifled by the rigorous
monastic rule. All foreign ideas and individual originality have so
far been trampled down. And the result is a people of inflexible
mgidity, wholly unable to adapt themselves to altering conditions,
and without any intellectual force or spiritual impetus. We sought
for, but did not find, the wonderful Mahatmas, who would lead us to
more lofty peaks of hght and wisdom than ever we had trod before.
And while I would not deny that Buddhism has done much to tame
and civilize a barbarous race of demon worshipers in Tibet, I would
warn those who would look to Lassa for any kind of higher intellec-
tual or spiritual guidance, to seek nearer home for what they need.
Imbued, as the Tibetans are, with much of that impassive contentment
ineculeated by Buddha, they are still, to all intents and purposes,
demon worshipers. Their religion is grotesque, and is the most
degraded, not the purest, form of Buddhism in existence.

Happily we were able to entirely overcome that feeling of obstruc-
tion which the heads of Tibetan Church had so far shown to out-
siders. Through Mr. Wilton’s influence with the Chinese officials,
and Mr. White’s connection of many vears’ standing with the Tibetan
lamas in Sikkim, and his tactful suasion, we were able to gain access
to all the monasteries and temples, and before we left Lassa British
officers went in and out with as little concern as they would to St.
Paul’s. I insisted upon having the convention signed in the Potala,
and in the finest hall in it, and once the lamas saw no harm resulted,
and we invariably treated them with consideration, they entirely
withdrew their obstruction, and when, just before leaving Lassa, I
paid a formal visit to the great cathedral called Jo Khang, I was
surprised to find them actually pressing me to come inside the rail-
ings and walk round the magnificent image of Buddha—a freedom
I have never had accorded me in any templein India.

T fear I have not sufficient time to adequately describe these mon-
asteries and temples. Outside they were solid and massive, though
hardly beautiful. Inside they were weird and quaint, and some-
times grotesque. I carried away with me an impression of immense
impassive figures of Buddha forever gazing calmly and tranquilly
downward, of walls painted with grotesque demons“and dragons, of
highly decorated wooden columns and roofs, of general dirt and
eriminess, and of innumerable bowls of butter burning night and
day, as candles are burnt in Roman Catholic churches before figures
of the saints.

GEOGRAPHICAL RESULTS OF THE TIBET MISSION. 277

Sooner than I could ever have expected, the convention was signed,
and we prepared for our return to India. Once business had been
arranged, the Tibetans were all as happy as possible. No single
person was responsible; each had had his say, and if blame had to
fall on anyone it had to fall on all, and all equally. But in their
heart of hearts they knew full well that they had got off remarkably
cheaply, and they had indeed the grace to acknowledge this. On
the morning of our departure the regent came down to our camp and
presented images of Buddha to Mr. White and myself, as well as to
General Macdonald. He thanked us for saving the monasteries and
temples, and in presenting the image of Buddha to me said, * When
Buddhists look on this they put aside thoughts of strife, and think
only of peace, and I hope that you, when you look at it, will think
kindly of Tibet.”

And certainly I left Lassa with every kindly thought. It was a
perfect autumn day; the sun was bright and warm. The valley was
looking its prettiest in its autumn foliage. The entire council, with
their secretaries, had come a mile down the road to offer us a farewell
cup of tea and to wish us godspeed on our journey. Their last words
were that they intended to keep the treaty and be friends with us in
future. Our hopeless task seemed indeed to have been accomplished
and good will to have been established.

And all that has happened since corroborates this impression. The
council had willingly given permission for a party of officers to pro-
ceed through Shigatse up the Brahmaputra to Gartok, in Western
Tibet, and then back to India by Simla. This important expedition
was placed in charge of Captain Rawling, who two years ago had
made a most successful journey in Western Tibet, while Captain
Ryder, R. E., was in charge of the survey. These two officers, with
Captain Wood, R. E., and Lieut. E. Bailey as their assistants, have
accomplished their arduous undertaking. Though accompanied by
only an orderly each, and no armed escort, they have traveled through
a thousand miles of Tibet and been well received everywhere. Cap-
tain Ryder has surveyed 40,000 square miles of country, including
the whole course of the Brahmaputra from Shigatse to its source, the
Mansorawar and adjoining lakes, and the sources of the Indus and
the Sutlej, and has proved beyond doubt that no higher mountain
than Mount Everest les at the back of the Himalayas. The party
suffered indeed terribly from the cold, their thermometer registering
24° below zero, but they crossed a pass 18,400 feet in height in Decem-
ber and reached India in safety. -

I trust, therefore, you will believe that the Tibet mission has not
been barren in geographical results, and that when you wish explora-
tion work to be done there are good and trusty men in India ever
ready and willing to do it.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA AND ITS RAILWAY
SYSTEM IN RELATION TO OCEANIC HIGHWAYS. :?

iro. Abe dee: Is hay Niu ciop ge

In a former paper on “ The port of the Upper Nile in relation to
the highways of foreign trade ” ” it was my aim to discuss the lines of
communication leading to the Upper Nile from Alexandria, Suakin,
Massaua, Berbera, Mombasa, and Chinde, and to determine the eco-
nomic zones that might be commanded by the highways of trade from
these several ports. It is my aim in this paper to give an account of
the economic development of Rhodesia, and to discuss its railway sys-
tem in relation to the oceanic highways.

Rhodesia comprises those territories the development of which is
directed by the British South Africa Company. It is well named,
for it was owing to the energy, enterprise, and sagacity of Mr. Rhodes
that the colony was founded and now forms part of the British Em-
pire. “ To see all that British is my dream!” Mr. Rhodes is said to
have exclaimed when referring to the possible acquisition of these
vast territories. As originally defined in the charter of incorpora-
tion, the extent of territory open to occupation by the South Africa
Company was “ the region of South Africa lying immediately to the
north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the
South African Republic and to the west of the Portuguese domin-
ions.” Its sphere is now bounded by the Transvaal Colony, Portu-
guese East Africa, the British Central Africa Protectorate, German
East Africa, the Kongo Free State, Angola, German Southwest Af-
rica, and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. It is divided into two
parts by the Zambezi—Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia,
and each of these again is subdivided into two provinces—Southern
Rhodesia into Matabeleland and Mashonaland; Northern Rhodesia
into Northwestern Rhodesia and Northeastern Rhodesia.

Africa is a continent of table-lands, and Rhodesia, physically
viewed, consists chiefly of a vast elevated table-land, the general alti-

tude of which varies from 3,000 to 5,000 feet. One or two points may
be chosen to indicate relative heights. The Zambezi at the confluence
of the Luangwa River is 780 feet above sea level, and at the Victoria
Falls it is 2,850 feet; Lake Tanganyika is 2,680 feet; the altitude of
Salisbury is 4,800 feet, and Marandellas, which is 5,600 feet above
sea level and 45 miles from Salisbury, is the highest point on the
railway between Salisbury and the coast; Bulawayo is 4,250 feet;
Fort Jameson 3,600 feet; Fife 5,400 feet. Rhodesia belongs to
several hydrographic systems—the Zambezi, the Kongo, the Sabi, and
the Limpopo.

Although the whole of Rhodesia falls within the Tropics, its cli-
mate is modified by its altitude, and as a very considerable part of it
is above 3,000 feet it may thereby be regarded as a white man’s coun-
try and well fitted not only for British residence, but for British col-
onization. It has been estimated that in Southern Rhodesia alone
there are 100,000 square miles above 3,000 feet with a suitable climate
for Europeans, and 26,000 square miles above 4,000 feet where the
average temperature allows European children to be born and bred.
The year is divided into two parts, according to the rainfall—a wet
and a dry season. The wet season begins about the end of October
and terminates about the end of April. From May to September
there is little or no rain, and this period—the Rhodesian dry season—
is the best time to arrive.

The economic possibilities of Rhodesia are manifold and immense.
To develop this potential wealth has been the aim of the British
South Africa Company. When the company was formed the chief
and virtually prescribed objects of its administration were to extend
northward the railway and telegraphic systems of the Cape Colony
and Bechuanaland; to encourage immigration and colonization; to
promote trade and commerce; to develop and work mineral and other
concessions.

The fame of gold and other mineral wealth has been associated
with this part of Africa since the most. ancient times. .Many old
workings have been found, and these have facilitated modern pros-
pecting. In Southern Rhodesia gold fields have been discovered
both in Matabeleland and Mashonaland—chiefly in the Bulawayo,
Gwelo, Salisbury, Umtali, and Mazoe districts. The development of
the gold fields has been frequently interrupted, but considerable
advance has been made, as may be seen from the progressive output.
Tn 1898 the output amounted to 16,706 ounces; in 1899, 56,742 ounces ;
in 1900, 85,366 ounces; in 1901, 172,035 ounces; in 1902, 194,170
ounces, and in 1903, 231,872 ounces. Copper has been discovered in
both Northern and Southern Rhodesia. In Southern Rhodesia it is
found in Victoria, Melsetter, Lo Mogundi, and Mafungabusi districts;
in Northern Rhodesia on the Kafue River and on the borders of the
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA. 281

Kongo Free State. The principal lodes, so far opened up, are on the
Kafue River and in the Lo Mogundi district. The deposits in North-
ern Rhodesia give every promise of a great mineralized field which
is being systematically developed. Several coal fields have also been
discovered. Chief among them is the vast coal field of Wanki,
which promises to be one of the most important discoveries in
Rhodesia. The coal is considered to be second only to the best Welsh.
Other minerals found in varying quantities are silver, blende, anti-
mony, arsenic, lead, and iron.

Although gold and other mineral wealth promote the speedy de-
velopment of new territories, the permanent prosperity of such a
country as Rhodesia must ultimately depend upon its pastoral and
agricultural resources. ‘“ Owing to its fertile soil,” says Mr. Ross
Townsend, secretary for agriculture in the Rhodesia administration,
“yeoular wet season, ample rainfall, genial climate, and cheap land,
Rhodesia offers prospects for successful farming operations second
to none in South Africa, and comparing favorably with most British
colonies. The fertility and variety of soils are capable of producing
most kinds of cereals, tobacco, vegetables, and fruit where energy and
enterprise are brought to bear on it, as has been practically demon-
strated in the different districts of the country.” It is worthy of note
that, owing to the geological formation of the country, the best
arable land is usually situated within a reasonable distance of the
gold reefs. There is always a great demand for agricultural produce,
at remunerative prices, at Bulawayo, Salisbury, and Selukwe. It is
estimated that in Matabeleland alone there are 50,000 square miles
available for pasture and arable land, and of this about 6,000 square
miles are suitable, without much preliminary work, for European
cultivation. The size of farms in Mashonaland is generally about
1,500 morgen (approximately 3,000 acres). Matabeleland farms are
about twice the size. Rhodesia offers attractive prospects to the man
of energy and enterprise who has a knowledge of agriculture and a
capital of £500 to £1,000. Mealies—maize or Indian corn—is the
staple cereal product and can be made to produce as heavy a yield
as in any other part of the world. The demand is practically un-
limited, not only for local markets, but throughout South Africa.
Wheat grows well and yields abundantly in many parts of the
country. Samples of Rhodesian wheat have been well received on
the British corn market. Root crops of all kinds do remarkably
well and yield heavily, especially potatoes. Cattle generally do well
everywhere. Sheep and goalts—Cape Boer goats, Persian sheep, and
the Cape fat-tailed sheep—thrive well all over Rhodesia and the
increase israpid. The merino sheep is found to do well in the eastern
highlands, where a million sheep could be grazed without overstock-

ing. The prevalence of horse sickness has hitherto prevented the
breeding of horses and mules; but Doctor Koch is convinced that a
simple process for immunization is possible much on the lines of his
process for inoculation against rinderpest, by which means South
Africa has been rid of that disease. If this system of inoculation
succeeds, as is anticipated, then there will be a great future for horse
and mule breeding in Rhodesia, not only in meeting local require-
ments, but in supplying remounts for the British army.

Of tropical and subtropical products the most important for Rho-
desia are rubber, tobacco, and cotton. Rubber is found in abundance
in the Sabi Valley, along the Zambezi, and in many parts of Northern
Rhodesia. Mr. Lyttelton Gell has discussed the future development
of this industry and has advocated the systematic cultivation of rub-
ber. Tobacco grows well everywhere, and in the opinion of an Amer-
ican expert there is a great field for enterprise, as the different varie-
ties of soil are capable of growing the light cigarette tobacco, the cigar
leaf, and heavy smoking tobacco. A special report on tobacco culture
has been prepared by Mr. G. M. Odlum, of the department of agricul-
ture of Southern Rhodesia in which he shows, from an investigation
of the industry in America and from analogy, that the growing of
tobacco will play an important part in agricultural development.

Another promising industry is the growing of cotton. Samples
both of native wild cotton and of that grown from Egyptian seed have
been favorably reported on, both by the British Cotton-Growing
Association and by the director of the Imperial Institute, London.
“T have examined,” says Mr. Wolstenholme, in his report (January
7, 1904) on behalf of the above-mentioned association, “ the samples of
cotton grown in Rhodesia now on view at the Liverpool Exhibition.
At the present moment they are worth considerably more than the
prices affixed to them, these, I think, being the figures I placed on them
some months since. The Egyptian seed lots are worth 8}d., and the
native seed 8id. to 9d. I feel sure that if you can keep up the stand-
ard of these samples there is a large fortune in the business. Your
Egyptian samples are much superior to the Nyassaland cotton sold at
Tid. per pound. Planters from the Zambezi inform me that they
could obtain plenty of labor, as the natives from Portuguese East
Africa prefer to work cotton to working in Rhodesian mines. It is
evidently one of the few countries where the product of the Egyptian
seed maintains its characteristics, Peru being the only other I know,
though it has been tried everywhere. If you have sufficient land and
labor available to produce quantity equal to the samples, you probably
have more valuable gold mines above than below ground in Rho-
desia.” If Rhodesia develops her cotton belt, it will be not the least
of her services in contributing to the economic prosperity of the
United Kingdom and the Empire.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA. : 283

Rhodesia is an inland country. This fact has an important bear-
ing on its economic development. The vital problem here, as in sey-
eral other parts of Africa, has been the inland carrying trade. Since
such an important river as the Zambezi flows through Rhodesia, it
might well be assumed that it would afford an easy line of access, and
that its waterway would become a great artery of commerce. But
on account of the configuration of the African Continent the naviga-
tion of the Zambezi is interrupted by falls and rapids at severa!
points where the river descends from the table-lands of the interior.
It is a river subject to great fluctuations of depth. During the wet
season it floods and rises as much as 15 to 20 feet; at the height of
the dry season it is reduced to shallow and uncertain channels which
vessels with merely a draft of 18 inches would find hardly naviga-
ble. The former difficulties at the delta have been removed since
1889, when the navigable Chinde mouth was discovered, and the port
of Chinde is now the chief entrepot for the several fields of trade
commanded by the Zambezi highway.

The Zambezi may be physically divided into three sections: The
lower river extending from the sea to the Kebrabasa Rapids—a dis-
tance of about 400 miles—the middle, from Kebrabasa to the Vie-
toria Falls, a further distance of 900 miles, and the upper, from the
falls to the source of the river, 600 or 700 miles. The lower section
up to Tete is navigable for stern-wheel and other small draft steam-
ers for eight or nine months in the year. During the other months
the shallows near Sena, where the river widens to a breadth of about
two miles, make navigation difficult. From Tete goods are taken
overland to Cachomba, a distance of over 130 miles, in order to avoid
the rapids. At Chicoa or at Cachomba, above the Kebrabasa, naviga-
tion again becomes possible to and beyond Zumbo, where the river is
again obstructed at the Kariba Gorge. At present goods are for-
warded from Cachomba either by carriers or by water to Zumbo and
Feira, and are distributed from these points. In order to facilitate
the transit of goods to the west, it is proposed to construct a wagon
road round the Kabrabasa rapids, and ultimately a light railway.
From Chinde the rates are £5 per ton to Tete, £10 for each passenger :
to Feira £25 and £30, respectively. Several of the transport com-
panies are devoting their energy and enterprise to developing this
highway of trade and the waterway of the upper Zambezi.¢

In January, 1901, at a meeting of the Royal Colonial Institute,
Major Gibbons discussed the Zambezi system as a waterway and sug-
gested schemes by which it might be developed into a great commer-
clal highway. “I look forward,” he said, “ to the day when a boat

284 THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA.

will travel those 1,200 miles from Chinde to Molele without the
necessity of transshipping.” This is a long view, but it indicates the
direction in which development is proceeding apace. At several
points along the main river the transit trade is rapidly increasing.
Thus Tete has become a convenient depot for the transit of goods and
an important point on the lines of communication to nortno, south, and
-west. Through Tete the telegraph system. passes from Rhodesia to
British Central Africa, and from the east coast to Zumbo. <A postal
service has been established by a weekly overland mail between Tete
and Salisbury and a commercial route will probably be developed
ap the Mazoe Valley with Southern Rhodesia. Another route of in-
creasing importance is that from Tete to Fort Jameson and other
parts of Northeastern Rhodesia. Goods are shipped to Tete from
Chinde and thence forwarded to Fort Jameson by carriers. The rates
of freight from Tete to Fort Jameson are 8s. to 10s. a load of 50 to
60 pounds. A road is at present under construction between these
two places to facilitate communications. From Chinde to Fort
Jameson the rates for goods by way of Tete are £25 a ton; for passen-
gers, £28.

The Zambezi system comprises that of the Shire River and Lake
Nyassa, and this is the best route to the northern and eastern districts
of northeastern Rhodesia. This Nyassaland route follows the Zam-
bezi and Shire waterways to Lake Nyassa. At Chiromo, or Katunga,
60 miles higher up the river, navigation ceases and goods are carried
overland, through Blantyre, to the Upper Shire. Stern-wheelers pro-
vide transport as far as Fort Jchnston, at the south end of Lake
Nyassa. From this point steamers ply to the several ports on the
lake. The ports for Northeastern Rhodesia are Domira Bay and
Kota-Kota for Fort Jameson, and Karonga, on the northern shore,
for Fife and Abercorn and the districts bordering on Lake Tan-
ganyika. The rates of freight by Lake Nyassa from Chinde are, per
ton to Fort Jameson, £28; to Karonga, £20; to Fife, £35; to Abercorn,
£50, and to Mweru, £75. The passenger rates to the same points are
£35, £30, £41 5s., £52 10s., and £75. A railway is now being con-
structed from Chiromo to Blantyre and thence to Lake Nyassa.
When completed it will form an important link in this system of
communications and greatly promote the increasing success of this
commercial highway to the heart of Africa.

The Zambezi, however, has hitherto played but a subordinate part
in the opening up of Rhodesia to commerce and civilization. It was
from the Cape that British enterprise developed communications with
the northern territories in the basin of the Zambezi.

One of Mr. Rhodes’s earliest efforts was to get the Cape parliament
to extend the Cape Government Railway to Kimberley. This was
allowed, notwithstanding considerable opposition. Afterwards the
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA. 285

Afrikander Bond determined that Kimberley should remain the ter-
minus of this railway, and that any further extension should be from
the Cape to Bloemfontein and Johannesburg. That this would give
control of the trade of the interior into the hands of the two Boer
States, and so be a menace to British interests, was only too evident.
The true route to the north was, according to Mr. Rhodes, through
Bechuanaland. When the British South Africa Company took over
the administration of the country Kimberley was the nearest center
of communication. After the charter was signed permission was
obtained to extend the Cape Government Railway from Kimberley to
Vryburg. This extension of 126 miles was begun in November, 1889,
and finished in December, 1890, the work having been completed in
little over a year. Want of funds, however, put a stop to further
extension for some time; but in May, 1893, the Bechuanaland Rail-
way Company was incorporated to continue the line northward from
Vryburg to Bulawayo via Mafeking, Palapye (Palachwe), and Fran-
cistown. This,a distance of 587 miles, was completed in October, 1897.
During the construction of this line the great rinderpest scourge swept
over the country, practically killing the whole of the trek oxen. It is
estimated that before the outbreak in 1896 there were over 100,000
cattle in Matabeleland, and by the end of the year there were only
about 500 left. The difficulty of transport thus brought about and
the outbreak of the Matabele war impelled the company to push
on this work by what may be termed forced marches, so that, in
most striking contrast with the earlier construction, the last 228
miles from Palapye to Bulawayo were completed in. the very short
space of four and a half months. The line was formally opened
on November 4, 1897. With the establishment of this direct com-
munication of Bulawayo with Cape Town, a distance of 1,360 miles,
was inaugurated a new era in the history of Matabeleland and
Rhodesia.

But Mashonaland was the first Rhodesian territory, and communi-
‘ation with the east coast was desiderated. While the Bechuana-
land Railway Company, now known as the Rhodesian Railways
(Limited), was constructing this line to Bulawayo, a line was being
projected from Salisbury to Umtali, and thence to the Portuguese
port of Beira. The distance between Salisbury and Beira is about
275 miles, but although the distance was not great, there were consid-
erable difficulties to be overcome. The Anglo-Portuguese treaty of
1891 had a clause which provided for the construction of a lne of
railway from the Pungwe River to Salisbury via Manicaland, but
political causes were responsible for much delay. Another serious
obstacle in constructing the line was the hilly nature of the country.
From sea level at Beira the country gradually rises. An altitude of
5,600 feet is attained at Marandellas, 45 miles from Salisbury, which
286 THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA.

is the highest point on the Salisbury-Beira line. From Marandellas
there is a gradual descent into Salisbury, which is 4,800 feet above
sea level. The chosen starting point of this line was Frontesvilla, 35
miles up the Pungwe River, from which place the line, 2-foot gauge,
was laid in a westerly direction for a distance of 75 miles. This see-
tion was opened in October, 1893. Considerable delay was ocea-
sioned in the construction of this first section, which runs through
the Pungwe Flats, by the frequent “ washaways ” which occurred
during the wet season. There were other difficulties also on ac-
count of the swampy nature of the country; yet the work went on
surely, and in November, 1894, the rail was carried on as far as Chi-
ioio, a distance of 118 miles from Fontesvilla. This point remained
« terminus for some years. It was not until October, 1896, that a
lhne was constructed between Beira and Fontesvilla. Thus there was,
a 2-foot gauge line for a distance of 153 miles. Great difficulties
were, however, experienced in continuing the line from Chimoio to
Umtali, on the Portuguese border, and it was not until February,
1898, that the 2-foot gauge line to the border was completed. In
1897 the Mashonaland Railway Company was formed to carry out
the construction of a 3-foot-6 gauge line from Umtali to Salisbury.
The work was begun on January 11, 1898, and the line was completed
in May, 1899, on which date Salisbury was in direct railway commu-
nication with Beira. As the line from Beira to Umtali was only of a
Y-foot gauge, considerable expense and delay were incurred in trans-
ferring goods from the narrow-gauge to the broad-guage line, and as
it was also found that the 2-foot gauge line could not cope with the
necessary amount of traffic, it was decided to widen it to the standard
gauge of 3 feet 6 inches. Before this work was entered upon the line
between Beira and Umtali was partly resurveyed, some of the worst
gradients were thus avoided, and a saving of 18 miles was effected.
The broad-gauge line from Beira to Umtali was completed in August,
1900. Since 1900 vast improvements have been effected on this Ine.
‘n former years “ washaways ” were frequent and dangerous, but the
addition of numerous culverts has done much to lessen the constantly
recurring damage caused by the rains to the permanent way. The
great need of Mashonaland had been from the outset a rapid and
cheap system of communication with the coast. Mr. Rhodes hoped
by a railway from Beira to Salisbury to reduce the cost of importing
food stuffs into the country from £70 to £10 a ton. The completion
of this railway system was therefore a great boon to all concerned
in the economic development of the eastern districts of Rhodesia.
The next phase in the development of the Rhodesian Railway sys-
tem was the linking up of Bulawayo with Salisbury. In 1898 Mr.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA. 287

Rhodes contemplated the extension of the main trunk line from
Bulawayo via Gwelo and the Zambezi to Lake Tanganyika as part
of his great Cape-to-Cairo scheme. After an unsuccessful attempt to
obtain the cooperation of the Imperial Government in this under-
taking, the various mining and exploration companies were ap-
proached, and sufficient funds were raised for the construction of
the first section of 150 miles. It was also decided, while the railway
was being pushed northward via Gwelo, to construct a line from
Salisbury to meet the northern extension. The line from Bulawayo
to Gwelo was begun in May, 1899, but its continuation was inter-
rupted by the Transvaal war. Although the northward extension
was thus stopped, the viligant and vigorous directors of the Rhodesian
Railways (Limited) decided to extend the line from Salisbury to-
ward Bulawayo, and by January 1, 1902, the 188 miles from Salis-
bury to Gwelo were completed and open to the public. After peace
had been proclaimed, and the line from Cape Town could be used for
transport of railway material, the construction of the lne from the
Bulawayo end was proceeded with, and on December 1, 1901,
six months after the Salisbury extension had reached Gwelo, Cape
Town and Beira were in railway communication. Thus the Rho-
desian Railway system became a connecting link in a through system
of South African communication from coast to coast.

This Rhodesian highway may be regarded as the vertebral system of
the colony. In an old and settled country the general direction of a
railway system is mainly determined by the recognized importance of
the towns and localities which it connects. But in opening up new
territories, while the topography must needs have a determining
influence, the problem is one also of the potential; the call is for
prevision—for a prudent anticipation of industrial centers and of the
general growth of the community.

These conditions have been well satisfied in the route chosen. The
alignment of the Rhodesian system follows the trend of the healthy
uplands, where the British born may settle and form permanent
homes. Already several thriving townships are found along the
route of the main railway. The effect of rapid and cheap communi-
cation soon became manifest in the noteworthy development of
Bulawayo. The line from the Cape reached Bulawayo some eight-
een months before Salisbury was connected with the coast.  Al-
though the township of Bulawayo was three years younger than
Salisbury, it soon exceeded the latter in population and in the num-
ber and size of its buildings. The streets are well laid out, and the
buildings are both handsome and costly. Government House; built
originally as a private house by Mr. Rhodes after the style of Groote-
Schuur, on the slopes of Table Mountain, is on the site of Lo Ben-
gula’s old kraal. An extensively laid out park connects it with the
288 THE DEVELOPMENT OF KHODESIA.

town, and its avenue, which has been planted throughout its entire
length, promises to become a rival to the great avenue at Cape Town.
Salisbury, which is the seat of government, has likewise some good
buildings and a well laid out park. On the railway between Bula-
wayo and Salisbury are the rising townships of Gwelo and Hartley.
The former is the center of the best gold-producing country. The
latter, which is 111 miles from Gwelo and 77 miles from Salisbury,
has many gold mines in its vicinity. Other townships in southern
Rhodesia are Victoria, Umtali, Enkledoorn, Melsetter, Rusapi,
Selukwe, Gwanda, and Tuli. Bulawayo and Salisbury have been
constituted municipalities. The smaller towns are controlled by
local sanitary boards.

Granite has hitherto been utilized only in building bridges and lay-
ing foundations, owing to the heavy working expenses entailed. It
is found, however, in large quantities throughout Rhodesia and
merely awaits the advent of hands and head.

The economic development of Rhodesia has necessitated the build-
ing of branch lines to several mining districts. From Bulawayo a
line has been laid down to the Gwanda district, which is rich in gold
and coal fields. The work, which was begun in 1899, was stopped on
the outbreak of the war. By March, 1904, 91 miles had been com-
pleted, and since that time there has been an addition of 13 miles,
which makes this important branch line 104 miles in length. The
interests of Selukwe, which is fast becoming the center of a large
gold-mining district, have also been advanced by connecting it with
Gwelo. This line, which is 24 miles long, was completed in 1908. It
is also intended to construct a line from Salisbury to the Mazoe Val-
ley, another mining district. The survey has been completed, and the
line will be about 26 miles long. By August, 1902, a 2-foot gauge
line was laid down from Salisbury as far as the Ayrshire gold mine.
This line is the property of the Ayrshire and Lo Mogundi Railway
Company; 84 miles have already been constructed, and it is contem-
plated to carry it on for 30 miles more to the Alaska mine. Another
branch is under consideration from Umtali northward to Penhalonga.

As an indication of local developments in the winning of gold, the
following statistics are derived from the Report of the Secretary for
Mines, Southern Rhodesia, for the year ending March 31, 1904. The
tons crushed amounted to 516,747, producing by milling 198,477
ounces, giving an average of 7°6 pennyweights per ton. In addition
to the gold obtained by milling, 29,272 ounces were recovered by
cyanide treatment, 5,511 ounces from concentrates, and 1,431 ounces
from various pannings. The grand total for the year amounted to
234,693 ounces. The production according to districts was as fol-
lows: Sixty-two thousand four hundred and forty-seven ounces in
the Bulawayo district; 136,292 ounces in the Gwelo district; 1,604
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA. 289

ounces in the Salisbury district ; 26,907 ounces in the Umtali district;
7.160 ounces in the Hartley district ; 38 ounces in the Lo Mogundi dis-
trict; 242 ounces in the Victoria district.

Gold mining, however, has not been the only mining industry which
has contributed to the development of the Rhodesian railway system.
In order to tap the northern parts of Rhodesia it was originally in-
tended that the hne from Bulawayo should branch off at Gwelo and
thence proceed through the Mafungabusi district to cross the Zambesi
at the Cariba Gorge, through Northwestern and Northeastern Rhode-
sia to Lake Tanganyika. This route, however, was found imprac-
ticable, as the country north of the Kariba Gorge was in no way
adapted to railway construction. In view of the difficulties to be
encountered from Gwelo, and on account of the important discovery
of a large coal area (600 square miles) at Wanki, it was decided. to
carry the line from Bulawayo in a more westerly direction than was
originally intended, through the vast timber forest of the Gwaai
River district, and on to the falls through the great Wanki coal field,
thence on to Lake Tanganyika. The work of laying the line was
commenced in May, 1901, and in September, 1903, the rail reached
Wanlkai, a distance of 200 miles from Bulawayo. On the route to
Wanki the line runs parallel with the Khami river, and after crossing
the Insese and Umeguza rivers it enters the extensive Gwaati forest.
The Gwaai River is crossed at a spot about 90 miles from Bulawayo,
at which point the altitude is 3,240 feet, or about 1,200 feet lower than
‘that of Bulawayo. The line then leaves the Gwaai, and after pass-
ing through a large expanse of sandy plains, it comes to Wanki.
From Wanki to Victoria Falls is a distance of 75 miles, and over this
part of the country, which is of a more hilly nature, the line was car-
ried and completed on April 25, 1904. The bridging of the Zambezi
has been a considerable engineering feat. It is expected that the con-
struction of the bridge will be completed in June of this year. The
extension of the railway north of the falls has been authorized as
far as Kalomo, 100 miles beyond the falls, the capital of Northwestern
Rhodesia. In order that the construction of this part of the line
may not be delayed, the material is being conveyed across the Zam-
bezi by means of an aerial cableway. At the present time (February,
1905) the earthworks on the north side of the Zambezi are completed
for the first 29 miles, and the rails are laid for 12 miles. From
Kalomo the railway will be continued northwestward to the Kafue

tiver. Beyond the river it will bifurcate, one line proceeding north-
westward, to develop the great mineral field of the Hook of the
Kafue, from which point it may ultimately be continued to the great
copper field of Kansanshi, on the border of the Kongo State. The
main branch is designed to proceed through Northeastern Rhodesia
290 THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA.

to Lake Tanganyika to form part of the Rhodesian section of the
great meridional highway from the Cape to Cairo.

Although the Victoria Falls will play an important part in the
economic development of Rhodesia when the immense power, there
available, is utilized for industrial purposes, it is as one of the greatest
sights of the world that they will appeal to visitors, to whom they
are now rendered easily accessible. The fame of these falls has
resounded through the world since they were first made known by
Doctor Livingstone. It is therefore fitting that the township which
has been founded in their vicinity is to bear his name. The site of
the town is near the left bank of the Zambezi, some 2 or 3 miles from
the falls, and the railway line to the north passes by it.

The origin of the falls was ascribed by Livingstone to a volcanic
rift, and this view has been universally accepted. But another view
has been recently mooted regarding their physical history which
ascribes the origin of the chasm‘and canyon to erosive action.¢

The Victoria Falls are about twice as broad and two and a half
times as high as Niagara. They are over a mile wide and about
400 feet high—higher than the top of St. Paul’s Cathedral. The
Zambezi at about half a mile above the falls is one and a half miles
in breadth, then it contracts and is suddenly precipitated into a com-
paratively narrow, profound trench or canyon, at the eastern end of
which there is an outlet about 100 yards in breadth through which
the whole of the contracted Zambezi rushes, forming the Boiling
Poi, and thence through a deep and narrow gorge of basaltic cliffs,
which is continued in a narrow winding canyon of about 45 miles in
length. The railway will cross the gorge a few hundred yards
below the Boiling Pot. The bridge, built on the cantilever principle,
forms a handsome span 650 feet long, with a width that allows ¢
double line of railway. When completed it will be the highest bridge
in the world. The falls themselves are not visible from the railway
where it crosses the river; but, in accordance with the wish of Mr.
Rhodes, the trains will pass through the perpetual spray rain while
crossing the bridge. The vicinity of the falls is celebrated for its
natural beauty, and parks are to be laid out on both banks of the
river. It is therefore hoped that the development of this renowned
locality will combine utility and amenity.

There are two other renowned localities in Rhodesia which have
led to the building or projecting of branch railways. Near Bulawayo
are the renowned Matopo Hills, where Mr. Rhodes in 1896, unarmed
and accompanied only by an interpreter, had an interview with the
Matabele chiefs, which resulted in a speedy cessation of hostilities.

2992 THE DEVELOPMENT OF RHODESIA.

Among the Matopos Mr. Rhodes, according to his own wish, was
buried. A railway has been built from Bulawayo to the Matopos by
the trustees of the Rhodes estate, as it was Mr. Rhodes’s wish * that
the people of Bulawayo may enjoy the glory of the Matopos from
Saturday to Monday.” The grandeur of those hills is aptly described
in the words of Mr. Rhodes when he called them “ the view of the
world.”

The other renowned locality is that of the Great Zimbabwe. The
historical associations of these ancient monuments contrast with the
modern associations of the Matopos; but they have this in common,
that they represent the commerce and civilization of their respective
ages. When the contemplated railway to Victoria has been built,
it will give access to the Great Zimbabwe, which is now recognized
as one of the finest ancient shrines in the world.

The founder of Rhodesia and the builders of the Great Zimbabwe
bring into association the British and the Sabeeans, and thus unite
across the ages two of the most celebrated commercial nations. How
io develop and maintain communications between the coast and inland
parts has been the vital problem in modern economic development, as
it probably was in that of ancient times. The chief ports at present
available are Chinde, Beire, and those of the Cape. To these will
probably be added, in time, Durban and Lourenco Marquez. Schemes
have been mooted which will give access to Rhodesia from the West
Coast through Angola and German Southwest Africa. At present
the two main highways of trade are from Beira and the Cape ports.
Bulawayo, which may be taken as the central point of the Rhodesian
system, is distant 676 miles from Beira, 1,198 miles from Port Eliz-
abeth, 1,259 miles from East London, 1,360 miles from Cape Town.
There is not much difference in the amount of goods passing through
Beira and the Cape ports. Much will depend, however, on the future
railway administration. According to the British consul at Beira,
it would appear that under present arrangements “ freights to Umtali
and Salisbury, which are respectively distant 203 and 375 miles from
the coast, cost approximately £5 per ton more than the railway
freights to these places over the Cape government railways from Port
flizabeth. which traverse over 1.400 miles to reach the same destina-
tion.”* There has been some concern at Cape Town regarding the
future relation of the town and port with Rhodesia; but it would
seem from the above report that there is a reasonable prospect of
Cape Town, with its rapid oceanic communications, maintaining its
commercial and strategic importance as the chief gateway to Rho-
desia and the north.

THE ETHICS OF JAPAN

By Baron KrENcHO SUYEMATSU, B. A., LL. M.

I have been asked by your council to read before you a paper on the
ethics of Japan, and this is my attempt in response to that request,
though very imperfect it must necessarily be.

There are three sources of factors which influenced the molding of
the ethical system in Japan, namely, Shintoism, Buddhism, and Con-
fucianism. The first is the native religion of Japan; the second is,
needless to say, a religion originated in India and introduced to
Japan through China and Korea, and the third is the moral teaching
of China. As to the relative positions of these three, I have already
fully explained this in an article entitled “ The religions of Japan,”
in the December number of the Independent Review. They are not
antagonistic to one another, as people not living in Japan might
imagine, and as would only appear natural to them from their own
notions of religion. Of these three, Buddhism is the most religion-
like in the ordinary sense of the term. Shintoism ranks next, but it is
very simple and liberal if viewed in the light of a religion. Confu-
clanism comes last; it is ordinarily classed by western writers as a
religion, but as a matter of fact its religious aspect is very vague, and
it is not considered a religion by the Orientals. Perhaps a better term
for it would be the Chinese teaching of morality, because moral
notions which can be gathered from Chinese study are comprised in
all sorts of Chinese writings, and Confucius, the great sage, is only
one of the exponents thereof. Confucius, however, takes a very high
place among those exponents, and therefore he came to be revered
more than any others by Orientals, and thus Chinese teaching came
to be usually associated with the name of the great sage. I can not
do-better than follow this example and call Chinese teaching by the
name of Confucianism.

Comparing these three systems of teachings with regard to ethics,
Confucianism stands out very prominently in its systematic exposition

294 THE ETHICS OF JAPAN.

and practical utility... Buddhism, it is said, is very philosophical,
and deep in its ideas of the cosmos, and there is no doubt that it is
capable of exercising’ a great influence on the popular notion of a
future life, though it does not do so as much in Japan as in some parts
of the Asiatic continent. It has, however, very little to say with
regard to ethics relative to the actual hfe of the human being. It
says you must not do wrong; it says you must do good; but as to
what is good or what is bad it is very vague in its meaning. It sug-
gests rather religious notions than practical ethics, how one should
behave in this world toward one’s fellow-creatures or toward the com-
munity or state to which one belongs. It speaks of ten warnings
and four benevolences. The ten warnings are: 1. Do not kill the liv-
ing. 2. Do not steal. 3. Do not’commit adultery. 4. Do not speak
wantonly. 5. Do not make sensational exaggerations. 6. Do not
‘alumniate. 7. Do not use a double tongue. 8. Do not be greedy.
© Do not be angry. 10. Do not entertain crooked views.

The four benevolences which one has to remember are: 1. The
father and the mother. 2. The ruler of the land. 3. “All beings.”
4. The three treasures, 1. e., the Buddha, the laws, and the priesthood
(order).

It speaks of compassion and forbearance. It also speaks of eight
correct ways: 1. Correct views. 2. Correct thoughts. 3. Correct
words. 4. Correct conduct. 5. Correct living. 6. Correct ministra-
tion, meaning self-reflection and aspirations. 7. Correct conception.
$. Correct mediation. - In their essense, however, all these teachings
are mostly of negative character, and, moreover, I must say that they
have more importance from a religious point of view than from an
ordinary and a practical ethical point of view. Therefore I can say
that Buddhism has very little to do with the ethics of Japan im the
sense of a systematic exposition of them, though in an indirect way
it has had some influence on the moral atmosphere of the Japanese,
as I shall show later on.

The Chinese teaching, otherwise called Confucianism, is a system
of moral teaching founded upon a patriarchal system of community.
Tt does not, therefore, only speak of the good conduct of an individ-
ual as relating to his fellowship with other individuals, but also from
the point of view of the whole system of community as a state.
Therefore it speaks of modes of governing and of being governed, as
well as of individual relationship between man and man. It
does not recognize any difference between sovereignty and ruler, nor
does it notice a difference between state and country. In it the great-
est natural bonds of humanity are five, and they are: (1) Sovereign
and subjects; (2) father (implying also mother) and child; (3) hus-
band and wife; (4) brothers (implying also sisters) ; (5) friends. To
each of these relationships the essential duty which is to be borne in
THE ETHICS OF JAPAN. 295

mind by each individual is separately attributed, and to each of these
duties a special term is given to designate its actions from the point
of view of a virtuous nature. Besides these five relationships there
are two other relationships which have to be added, namely, the rela-
tionship between the elder and the younger, not necessarily meaning
brothers, and also the relationship between master and pupil. The
term “the sovereign and subjects,” in oriental notions, signifies in
their bearing a very deep meaning in their mutual relationship. I
once heard from a very trustworthy authority that a Western diplo-
matist, well versed in oriental affairs, had said that the oriental idea
concerning sovereign and subjects was not and could not be thor-
oughly understood by Occidentals, and I think that remark is not far
from the truth.

The idea of the best virtue that a sovereign can have is “ jen,” mean-
ing to be as humane as possible to his subjects, detesting oppression,
giving the best administration to his country—in a word, to be the best
ruler that ever ruled a land. The idea of the best subject is loyalty.
The idea of that of father and son is filial piety on the part of the
child and strictness on the part of the father, which is modified in the
case of the mother toward tenderness, for which there is a special
term. The idea which governs the relationship between man and
wife is harmony. The older word for this was “ distinction,” mean-
ing “ not to be unseemly,” but the word “ harmony ” is also used some-
times, and we Japanese prefer it. The idea of that of brothers and
sisters is brotherly friendship, for which also a special word exists.
The idea of that of friends is trustworthiness. In this way all the
five cardinal bonds are dictated by desirable manifestations of sym-
pathetic attentions to one another. But of course more prominence
is given to the virtue of a subject, a child, or younger brother, in the
case of a sovereign and subjects, of parents and children, and of
brothers, respectively. Then, again, the elder and the younger in
general are expected to respect each other as the case demands, and
the relationship between them is to be regulated by a term which ts
equivalent to the English word “ order;” that is to say, the younger
should not seek to supersede the elder, but to pay respect to him,
while the elder is expected not to take advantage of the younger, but
to treat him with kindness. The relationship between master and
pupil is also regarded as very important. The pupils are expected
to respect their masters almost as much as their parents, while the
master 1s expected to treat his pupils with parental kindness; no
businesshke thought is to enter their minds. In the olden times in
the East the system of teaching and learning was very different from
that which exists in these modern days. The teacher taught his
pupils out of the love of imparting his knowledge and_ virtuous
example, as well as the doctrinal principles he entertained, while the
296 THE ETHICS OF JAPAN.

pupils were supposed to gather around him out of their admiration
for the personality of their master and for the purpose of receiving
his instructions and influence for their personal improvement and
future usefulness. Such being the case, it was no wonder that the
relationship between a master and his pupil was regarded with so
much importance in ethics.

Apart from these classifications the virtuous attributes of man are
spoken of in several other ways. We have first of all ‘“ wisdom,
humanity, and courage.” These three are considered to be the three
greatest traits of character to be embodied in one person. Wisdom
may not exactly fall under the category of a virtue in its strictest
sense, but I suppose we need not be very critical on this point. In this
instance humanity—that is, * jen” in the Chinese original—may be
interpreted as comprising every other virtue besides mere merciful-
ness. There is another catalogue, viz, “ humanity, justice, decorum,
wisdom, and faithfulness.” These five are considered essential ele-
ments of virtue for regulating a community, and should be observed
by each member of it. There is another—* filial piety, brotherly
friendship, loyalty, and faithfulness; ” these give guidance to a man
in his capacity of a son, a brother, a subject, and a friend. There is
yet another—* sympatheticability, goodness, respectfulness, — self-
restraint, and modesty.” These are virtues considered important as
regards one’s self-control. As to the women, ‘ quietness, modesty,
and purity ” are considered the ideal traits of their character, besides
all those which I have just described above, which are of course apph-
cable to women to an extent almost equal to men.

In the West the term love plays an extensive part in governing all
the mutual relationships of the kinds enumerated above. The essence
of oriental ideas does not differ from it in its purport, but expressed
in words the word love does not play so extensive and imperative a
part as it does in the West, because in the Confucian doctrine differ-
ent technical terms are used, as we have already seen, to meet each
particular case. The word love is used very sparingly in the Confu-
cian books, and it 1s used more especially for designating one kind of
virtue, as, for example, “ extensive love,” meaning philanthropy in
the western sense. The word “jen,” which ordinarily may be trans-
lated as humanity, more resembles the western word love, because
that word “jen” may be interpreted in many ways suitable to the
occasion on which it is used, almost in the same way, and in a simiiar
sense, that the word love can be used. But the meaning of that word
“jen” is more comprehensive and deeper because it imphes some
other meaning than mere attachment. I will not worry you by going
into full details of the interpretation of that word, as it is too tech-
nical. There is, however, one thing worth noticing about the word
love in Chinese. When that word is singled out it is also applicable

THE ETHICS OF JAPAN. 297

to many cases, including the relationships above enumerated. Thus it
can be used in a very comprehensive manner, and thence there arises a
question about the essence of the word. The question is whether the
notion of love is absolute, and consequently has no gradation or dif-
ferentiation in its nature. At the time of Mencius, some time after
Confucius, there was a school of philosophers who maintained that
there ought not be any differentiation, but Mencius maintained that
that was a fallacy. The word may be the same, but the practice may
be differentiated according to the circumstances. The meaning is
that one should love a nearer object more than a distant one, and thus
the ethical notion of cosmopolitanism was reconciled with other
notions of different virtues—in other words, if one does good to his
neighbor more than to a stranger, or if one does more good to his
country than to other lands, out of the feeling of love, it is quite justi-
fiable from an ethical point of view, and thus Chinese ethics are mede
reconcilable with the principles of state. And this is, I think, an
important landmark in which Confucianism differs from the features
of an ordinary religion, which in its essence is, as a rule, founded
upon cosmopolitanism, and knows not an artificial boundary of states.

There is a Chinese maxim which says, * No loyal subject serves two
masters, and no virtuous woman sees two men.” The cardinal points
of the Chinese ethics are loyalty and filial piety; so that, although
all sorts of virtues are inculcated, greater importance is placed on
these two points. In China, learning means studying moral teach-
ing. There are, of course, many subjects for study, but moral no-
tions pervade every branch of literature. It is so, even with history,
Chinese histories, as a rule, record only events as they occur; they
have no historical or political observations, and any observations
made by the writers are written in such a way as to draw attention
from a moral standpoint. Their histories, therefore, have very little
value in the ordinary sense of history as the term is employed among
Western nations, but the fact remains that they pay much attention
to moral lessons. Their expositions of moral teaching are done more
in the way of philosophical or scholastic dissertations. The ethics
of China, however, were not necessarily identical throughout the
long period of her history, extending over several tens of centurtes.
There were several schools of philosophers besides Confucius, some
of whom even went so far as to differ from him in many points; and
also the interpretations of Confucianism differed at different epochs.
But the chief feature of his teaching has always remained the same,
and all that I have said about it above represents fairly the idea of
Confucian doctrine. It is natural that Confucianism should be re-
garded as a sort of religion, because its followers respect it almost as
a believer in religion respects his creed; moreover, Confucianism

recognizes In a measure the existence of some supreme power. It
speaks of heaven in the sense of a power; it speaks of the “ order
of heaven;” it even speaks of the “supreme emperor,” nieaning
the Supreme Being. It also recognizes the immortality of the soul,
though in a vague manner, and pays great attention to festivals
given in honor of one’s ancestors; to use a common phrase, it worships
the ancestors. But the parts of Confucianism which relate to the
future of man only form a subordinate element of it, so much so that
Confucius himself once said, * I do not yet know the hving, how can
IT know the dead?” At all events I, in common with most Orientals,
do not regard Confucianism as a religion in its ordinary sense. There
are of course many customs and matters of etiquette sanctioned by
Confucianism, or rather enforced by it, which are absurd or imprac-
ticable in the eyes of the Japanese, but there is no necessity for me to
dwell upon these shortcomings here.

Let us now see what is Shintoism. It is essentially indigenous to
the soil of Japan. It may be regarded as religion, and yet if it be a
religion it is certainly of a unique kind, having nevertheless much
similarity to the ancient cults of the Greeks and the Romans. It has
no founder, nor has it any dogmas, in the ordinary sense of a religion.
It has grown up with the customs and traditions and general char-
acteristics of the nation. It recognizes the immortality of the soul;
it acknowledges the existence of supernatural powers; it reverences
the ancestral spirits, and therefore it may be called a religion ot
ancestral worship. In that respect it resembles Confucianism. It
concerns itself, however, with temporal affairs far more than with
spiritual affairs. In this respect also it very largely resembles Confu-
cianism. It has existed in Japan from time immemorial, long before
the introduction of Confucianism and Buddhism.

From an ethical point of view it has more teaching in it than
Buddhism, but it is not so elaborate as Confucianism. Nevertheless
it has a tight grasp of the Japanese mind. It is supremely content
With its simple tenets, so much so that a well-known scholar, who
was a devout supporter of it, when speaking of its ethical teaching
in comparison with Confucianism, once said that * We do not want
so many nomenclatures as Confucianism requires to signify all sorts
of virtues and good conduct, and our simple teaching is quite enough
to cover all.”

Shintoism is also based upon a patriarchal form of community.
Its essential notion of ethies is cleanliness of conscience; but the
idea of cleanliness is applied not only mentally, but also physically—
hence its tendeney to bodily cleanliness as well as other cognate mat-
ters. It speaks of good and bad; it designates bad minds as “ black ”
or “muddy,” and good minds as “red” or “clear.” Its ideals of
conduct are honesty and straightforwardness. It reverences its
THE ETHICS OF JAPAN. 299

ruler from the very nature of its cult, and a magnificent ideal of a
subject and a citizen is developed from these simple notions.

Such are, then, the three great sources of Japanese ethics. It is
like the foam produced by currents of water. The water is the source,
but when foam is produced it differs from actual water. So Japanese
ethics are produced by the intermingled notions of these agencies, but
they are no longer of the same substance as their source. JI mean to
say that our ethics have formed their shape quite independently of
the orthodox or dogmatic parts of any religion, and people regard
them as such in the same way as one would ordinarily regard foam
as differmg from water. I will now explain how this has been
brought about. From about the sixth century of the Christian era
Chinese study was introduced into Japan, and almost simultaneously
Buddhism was also introduced to our country. The study of Chinese,
as I said before, means the study of Chinese ethics, and I may say
that Chinese has become almost lke our own literature, though we
had our vernacular literature coexisting. The study of Chinese,
therefore, meant the introduction of Chinese ethical notions, in the
same way as the study of Greek or Latin introduced Greek or Roman
notions into European countries. This, however, did not mean that
it supplanted our own ideas of morality, but it rather supplemented
and augmented our notions in so far as it concerned the nomenclature
and classification of different ethical virtues. We did not mean to
make ourselves slaves to Chinese notions, we rather utilized Confu-
clanism; and therefore Confucianism, as interpreted in Japan, is not
the same as Confucianism in China. There is a story told of a Jap-
anese professor, who was a deeply read Chinese scholar, and his pu-
pus. The master once asked his pupils: “ Suppose China invaded
Japan with an army led by Confucius himself as the generalissimo,
and assisted by Mencius as his heutenant; what would you do?”
The pupils replied: “ It would be our bounden duty to take up arms
unhesitatingly for our country and beat and crush them to pieces.”
Thereupon the master smiled and expressed his glad assent. This
will show how we interpret Chinese teaching.

Then also Buddhism, poor as it is in ethics, has contributed some-
thing toward forming our national character, in that it has indi-
rectly assisted in inculeating gentleness and also kindliness to living
beings. I may go a step further. Buddhism itself, as interpreted
in Japan, is not the same Buddhism as it was originally. It had to
accommodate itself to the requirements of the country. Then, also,
Buddhism in China and Japan is studied in books which are trans-
jated into Chinese, and therefore the priests who study their own
religion have also to study Chinese, which, I repeat, involves the
study of Confucianism, and therefore they are familiar with that
teaching. The Japanese priests, therefore, made use of Shintoism
300 THE ETHICS OF JAPAN.

and Confucianism in their own teaching on any points where they
found their own teaching was deficient—that is to say, they did so
in practical and moral teaching. And not only that, we notice even
the dictum of Buddhism itself is sometimes modified to suit such
purposes. I mentioned above four benevolences spoken of in Bud-
dhism as being “ the father and the mother,” “ the ruler of the land,”
“all being,” and ‘“ the three treasures.” I do not know whether this
is to be found in the Sanscrit original; [ think it is not. It sounds
more like a Chinese Buddhistic notion. It is still further modified
in an old Japanese book as “ heaven and earth,” “the ruler of the
Jand,” * the father and the mother,” and “ all beings.” And thus for
“the three treasures” is substituted “heaven and earth.” This
occurs In a passage which is put into the mouth of a famous Shige-
mori in a discourse which he made when he severely admonished
his father, Taira-no Kiyomori, though with filial tenderness, when
ihe latter had behaved badly toward his sovereign the Emperor.
The passage is to be found in a famous book written in the middle
cf the fourteenth century by Kitabatake Chikafusa, who was a court
noble, a royalist, and a man with much knowledge of Buddhism.
Here I have to speak of Bushido. The term, as well as its general
purport, has been of late made widely known in this country; but, as
many people wish it, I will say something about it, although it may
be only, as we say, “adding legs to the picture of a serpent ”—I mean
it may be quite an unnecessary addition. Bushi literally means a
pulitary gentleman or, in more common English, a military man, and
“do” literally means a road or way, and in its extended significance,
a principle, a teaching, or a doctrine. The term for “ bushi” in old
refined Japanese is “ mononofu ” and the term for ‘“ do” is ‘* michi;”
therefore the more refined ancient Japanese name for Bushido was
Mononofu-no-Michi. The origin of the “ bushi” is as follows: They
were originally large or small landlords of the provincial parts of
Japan, and had their retainers or vassals. At the tine when, in the
court of the Empire, over refinement, or rather effeminacy, succeeded
enlightenment, and nobles who usually resided in the capital came to
despise military service, those landlords and their retainers began to
play military roles under different distinguished leaders. They were
more prominent in the eastern parts of the country, called Kwanto,
namely, the large plain, in the middle of which modern Tokyo, is sit-
uated. With the march of events, when the governing power fell into
the hands of the military leaders, these landlords and their retainers
began to form an hereditary class, and the system extended to the
whole country. This is the origin of Daimio and Samurai. I do
not say that in the case of later developments of this system all
Daimio and Samurai necessarily belonged to the same ancient stock,
THE ETHICS OF JAPAN. 301

because at the time when the country went through many stages of
war many new men appeared on the scene and enlisted themselves in
the ranks of the Samurai, among them the bushi, several of whom
became Daimios themselves by their personal valor and the distine-
tion they attained. But I may say that, on the whole, the successive
stages of the class always inherited and handed down the same sort
of sentiments and notions as their predecessors.

We may, in a measure, compare this military class with the country
squires in this country, who gradually became barons of the middle
ages, together with their children and retainers. “ Bushido” is no
other than the doctrine held and cherished by that class as its code
of honor and rule of discipline. In the earliest days of the develop-
ment of that class individuals forming it were not cultured or en-
lightened in the sense of luxurious refinement; in other words, they
were mostly illiterate. But, on the other hand, they were mostly men
with healthy notions of manliness in contrast to those who usually
lived in the capital town where literary and artistic culture under
Chinese influence had been attained in a marked degree. The
motive and sense of their culture were therefore more like those be-
longing to primitive Japan, unstained by foreign influences. The
families belonging to this class were called in their early days “ the
houses of the bow and arrow.” Needless to say that the early
projectile weapons of warfare were the bow and arrow, and they had
a place of honor among the warlike instruments of those days.
Little by little a phrase “ yumi-ya-no-michi,” literally meaning * the
ways of the bow and arrow,” came into existence, and it was the origi-
nal name of Bushido. At first, perhaps, the word referred more es-
pecially to the proper use of the instrument of war, but it soon came
to signify something more. There were many ceremonies and eti-
quettes which grew up with a warrior’s life and military affairs, not
only with reference to his comrades or to his superiors and inferiors,
but also with reference to how he should comport himself toward
his enemy. At the bottom of all these matters there lay the idea of
honor, not merely one’s own honor, but also a compassionate regard
for the honor of the enemy. All these ideas came to be implied in
the term “ the ways of the bow and arrow.” Here we see that special
moral sentiments were being awakened among this class. Bushido,
however, has no particular dogma or canon, except such as grew from
practice and except those of which we can gather some idea from in-
structions given by certain leaders or by certain teachers of military
ceremonies or science in the way of interpretation of such matters.
Here we have an instruction given to his men by Yoritomo, the first
shogun, and therefore one of the early leaders of the system. The
essential points of the instructions are these: 1. Practice and mature
302 THE ETHICS OF JAPAN.

military arts. 2. Be not guilty of any base or rude conduct. 3. Be
not cowardly or effeminate in behavior. 4. Be simple and frugal.
5. The master and servants should mutually respect. their indebted-
ness. 6. Keep a promise. 7. Share a common fate by mutual bond-
age in defiance of death or life.

We may say that notions such as these were the foundations of the
ethical parts of Bushido. ‘These will mean when interpreted in ethi-
cal terms of the Chinese school: 1. Diligence in one’s profession. 2.
Love and loyalty between master and servants. 3. Decorum and pro-
priety. 4. Gallantry and bravery. 5. Trustfulness and justice. 6.
Simplicity and frugality. ¢. Contempt of meanness.

At the bottom of these lay the sense of honor. When speaking of
any action as unworthy of a bushi, the following phrase was custo-
marily used in early days, “ It is disgraceful in the presence of the
hand of the bow and arrow,” as in later days one would say “a dis-
grace to bushi,” in the same way as you would say in English, * It is
unbecoming to a gentleman.” The term * bushi” has in many ways
a similar meaning to “ gentleman” in English. Bushido, of course,
encouraged bravery above all things. In an old book describing the
war between Gen and Hei, an account of the bravery of bushi of
Kwanto—namely, the plain above referred to as that where Bushido
originated—is put into the mouth of a general of Hei as having been
addressed to his generalissimo, who commanded the army of Hei,.
which was formed of recruits coming from Kioto and its neighbor-
hood. The narrative was to this effect: “According to the usage of
the warriors of the East, the son would not withdraw from the battle-
field, though his father might die, or the father would not think of
retiring though his son might fall. He would advance and advance,
and jumping over the dead, would fight regardless of death or life.
As to our own men, they are all weakly recruits from the neighbor-
hood of the capital (where effeminacy reigned at the time). If the
father were wounded, the son and all the members of the family would
take advantage of this and retire; 1f the master were lalled, his follow-
ers would utilize the chance and, hand in hand with their brothers,
would withdraw and disappear.” This may be a somewhat exagger-
ated account, but it will show how greatly the original bushi estimated
bravery in the same way as our men do in these days.

In addition to these characteristics some other features which were
brought into more prominence are entitled to be singled out—namely,
fortitude, generosity, imperturbability in the presence of danger or
oh any unexpected occurrence, compassionateness, and straightfor-
wardness. This kind of attitude was inculecated even in physical
exercises of different modes of fighting, such as fencing, practice
THE ETHICS OF JAPAN. 303

with the spear, and jujitsu. There is a verse composed by a Japa-
nese which may be translated thus:

Evensin the eyes of the warrior

Whose beard is ten fists long,

The one thing that softly flows from them

Is the tear which is due to love.

This aptly expresses the innate tenderness of heart of a Japanese
warrior. There is another verse composed and penned by Com-
mander Takeo Hirose in Chinese just before he went to his doom on
the occasion of the second bottling up of Port Arthur, and which,
therefore, constituted his last utterance in this world. Translated
into English it runs as follows:

Would that I could be born seven times
And sacrifice my life for my country :
Resolved to die, my mind is firm,

And again expecting to win success,
Siniling I go on board.

This will show the fortitude and determination of a bushi at the
hour of his exit from this life, and though Hirose was a man of our
own day, he may be regarded as one of the best types of an old bushi.

Bushi is not foreign to Shintoism. As a matter of fact bushi gen-
erally respect Shinto deities, and, moreover, some military ceremonies
were performed in the supposed presence of a Shinto god. Bushi
openly invoke the god of war without any compunction, but bushi
never have done so in a bigoted way. It was more in the way of
reverence paid to a deity of their inherited cult. They were never
devotees of Shintoism as a religion. This sort of sentiment of the
Japanese is very difficult to explain with clearness, but my meaning
is that though they do not despise religion they place more im-
portance on the affairs of the world and on their own exertions in
the matters which they undertake. The Samurai do not worship
their deity in order that their souls may be safely rescued in the
future. I can therefore say that Bushido, as such, has no bearing
upon Shintoism. It has its own independent existence, although to
the extent I have just referred to it has its connection with Shinto-
ism. In other words, Shintoism was a cult founded upon our old
customs and traditions, and therefore Bushi also shared the senti-
ments pervading that cult, but we can not say that Shinto has pro-
duced Bushido.

And again, bushi do not despise Buddhism; on the contrary, many
of them may revere it, but Bushido, as such, has no connection with
this faith. In documents they often make use of a phrase in a vague
way, “by the help of Shin-Butsu,” meaning both the Shinto deity
and Buddha; but it does not mean that it has any foundation in
304 THE ETHICS OF JAPAN.

Buddhism. If a bushi were a believer in Buddha he probably would
not like to show it. We have a story about Yoritomo, the first head
of the Shogunate. When he first started in his-youth his campaign
against Hei, and hid himself in a mountain nook, having been de-
feated by his enemy he took out from his queue a small image of
Kwanin (Iwannon) which he reverenced, saying, “if my head be
taken by the enemy it would not be becoming to the generalissimo of
Gen if this image were to be discovered.” This will give you an idea
of the way in which Buddha was viewed by bushi. As we all know,
Buddhism chiefly speaks of the future world. The idea of the bushi
was that it was an act of cowardice if one merely did good because
ene wished to be saved in the future world. Their idea was that
good should be done for its own sake, and therefore if one believed in
Buddha he had a sort of apprehension that he might be considered a
coward. Of course history is not wanting in many instances of great
warriors believing in Buddhism, but in many cases this fact had no
great significance as far as their conduct and conscience were con-
cerned. There was, however, one feature in which a certain aspect
of Buddhism had a considerable influence in molding Bushido; it
was the influence of the teaching of the Zen sect. This requires some
explanation. In the thesis of Buddhistic teaching there is included
the idea of absorbing everything in the universe into oneself; in
other words, mental annihilation of all things except oneself. This
is done by long and fixed meditation, and at least so far as he himself
is concerned, a man can for the moment imagine and realize mentally
that he is the only being in the universe, and all other things become
nothing. Hence, when he is accustomed to meditation of that descrip-
tion, nothing will ever surprise or frighten him.

There is a story about Hieuntsang, the famous Chinese Buddhist
of the Tan period, who visited India. This priest was once caught
by a band of robbers. He sat quietly down and began to meditate
in the way described above. The robbers tried to intimidate him by
threatening him with drawn swords pushed right into his face; but
the priest took no notice whatever of what they were doing to him,
and remained entirely unmoved. The robbers, observing the atti-
tude of the priest, and thinking that he must be an extraordinary
personage, all went away and left him alone. This phase of Bud-
dhism was introduced into China, where it became the cult of one
separate sect of Buddhism. Bodhi-Dharma, an Indian priest, who
visited China, is commonly accepted as the founder of this sect,
which practices meditation more than do other sects, but of course
meditation is not its only feature. In general, we may say it 1s more
philosophical in the sense of regarding the universe in a mibilistic
sense. This sect is called Zen, and it has been introduced into Japan
also. It was patronized by several eminent bushi in its earlier stages.
THE ETHICS OF JAPAN. 305

Perhaps it was liked by them in that, according to its doctrine. a man
puts aside the idea of reliance upon another and places himself above
everything else, and it was found to have an agreeable resemblance
to the spirit of self-reliance inculeated by Bushido. In the second
place it repels ali ideas of luxury and display and values simplhcity
and cleanliness, and in that respect it was found to bear an agreeable
resemblance to the frugal and simple life of the bushi. Thus the
Zen came to exercise its influence over the bushi, but not at all in the
sense of believing in future felicity; quite to the contrary, from the
very nature of that sect. This influence of Zen seems to have helped
to a great extent the development of some of the characteristics of
Bushido, such as imperturbability, stoicism, fortitude, and simplicity
and cleanliness of thought or body. Here I may add that many traits
of Bushido are no doubt to be found in the European knighthoods
of former days, and therefore they are not really new to the Euro-
peans who still remember those traditions.

The weakest point of Bushido in its earlier stages was its want of
literary culture in the way of systematic ethical study, hence it easily
happened that a thing one might regard as correct might not be cor-
rect in reality when examined from a higher point of view. This
difficulty was especially observable when two obligations came into
conflict, and one had to be preferred to the other. The bushi, in the
earlier stages, knew more about their duty to their immediate master
than to higher ones; hence their difficulty in discerning their duty to
the supreme ruler of the land and their immediate head. Of course,
they knew that the Emperor was the highest personage in the country,
but they were unable to find out an ethical solution of the question,
and indeed in all matters they wanted more systematic enlightenment.

These wants, however, have been supplied gradually as time went
on, especially during the last three centuries. During this period
almost unbroken peace reigned in the country. It ceased to have any
intercourse with foreign countries except in a limited sense, but inter-
nally all branches of art-and industry were encouraged and developed
side by side. The study of Chinese and of native classics have been
carried out in all parts of the land, and it was the bushi who chiefly
devoted themselves to such culture. Bushi or samurai were retainers,
as everyone knows, of their lords, and certain pensions were given by
their lords to each family, according to their rank,so that they had not
to work for their own living. Hence their only duty was to make
themselves physically and mentally fit to fight for their lords in time
of necessity, and in times of peace to make themselves as much like
gentlemen as possible. In other words physical training and mental
enlightenment, together with the refinement of their manners and hab-
its, were their sole business—they had no other occupation. For,
indeed, any other occupation which partook of the shape of business
306 THE ETHICS OF JAPAN.

conducted for profit was forbidden and was despised among them.
Bushido came to be deeply imbued with the principles of Chinese and
Japanese classics as they were taught.

I have shown above that in the systematic exposition of ethical
ideas, Confucianism was the richest of all, and the essential part of
it was taken by Bushido; as I have also shown above, there are many
defects in the Chinese teaching; all the unimportant parts were cast
away and the important parts were taken into the teaching of
Bushido, and even these parts only in such a way as to suit our
national traditions and characteristics, the essential spirit of Shinto-
ism also being resuscitated in such a way as to give an impetus to
Bushido, though in no orthodox manner. Such then is our Bushido.
The bushi formed the governing class of the Japanese society, and
it may be said the educated class also, or in other words the bushi
may be called the gentry of the country. We can, therefore, say
that Bushido was the ethics of Japanese society. In one way it may
be said that Bushido, as such, was a monopoly of the military class,
but in truth its spirit was not confined to this only; the literary study
of Chinese, as well as of native classics, was not necessarily limited
to the military class; hence the same notions which were imbued in it
through these studies were also quietly extending their influence
among people at large—among whom, I may add, there were many
families of old bushi, or familes which were quite equal in their
standing to the bushi class. Moreover, the spirit of Bushido has
also been making its influence felt by other people. Thus we can see
that the nation has been preparing itself for centuries for the pro-
motion of moral ideas of the same kind as those of Bushido.

The cardinal points of oriental ethics, as may be expected, are
loyalty and filial piety. In China filial piety takes precedence, but
in Japan loyalty stands first. There is a poem by Sanetomo, the
third shogun of Kamakura and second son of the first shogun, which
may be translated literally as follows:

The sea may dry up,

The mountain may burst asunder,
sut no duplicity of thought

Shall I have to my sovereign.

Such is the idea of loyalty which has been taught to the Japanese
for centuries. Side by side with loyalty the idea of patriotism—a
term which in Japanese is almost identical in its purport with loy-
alty—was also inculeated, though the development of this last idea
was later than the former. Then, also, all the other ideas relating to
ethics, especially on the lines indicated in Confucianism, were incul-
eated side by side. With the abolition of the feudal system, some
thirty years ago, the structure of Japanese society was totally
changed, or rather restored to the condition which preceded the
THE ETHICS OF JAPAN. 8307

ascendency of the military class in the twelfth century. The ques-
tion now arises, What is the actual state of ethics in Japan at present ?
There is a new element which has been introduced into Japan in re-
cent years, and it is in the form of Christianity. The constitution
guarantees freedom of conscience, and therefore there is no hindrance
to the propagation of the Christian doctrine with its moral teaching,
and, as a matter of fact, there are a number of Japanese who have
embraced that faith, but they are after all a very small minority com-
pared with the number of the whole Japanese population. The es-
sence of Japanese ethics is the same as existed prior to the new epoch,
with certain modifications actuated by the new force of the altered
conditions, which, after all, are only in small details. I may say, in
a word, that the Japanese ideal ethics form an extension of Bushido
among the people at large from the nonextinct class of Bushi with
whom it originated. As to how they stand at present and how they
are inculcated among the people at the present time, I must refer my
audience to an article entitled “ Moral teaching of Japan,” which was
contributed by me to the February number of The Ninteenth Century
and After. The sphere of the teaching is extensive, as is necessary
from the very nature of the matter, but its essence may be summed up
in a comparatively small compass. - For this I can not do better than
quote a part of the so-called * Imperial Educational Rescript ” given
to his people by the present Emperor. It is quoted in my article to
which I have just referred, but I will recite it once more:

It is our desire that you, our subjects, be filial to your parents and well
disposed to your brothers and sisters. Let husband and wife dwell harmoni-
ously together; let friends be mutually trustworthy. Impose upon yourselves
self-restraint and rectitude of behavior. Extend to the multitude philanthropy.
Advance learning and regulate your pursuits, developing the intellectual facul-
ties and perfecting the virtuous and useful elements. Further seek to enhance
the public good and enlighten the world by deeds of social benefit. Treasure
always the fundamental constitution and respect the national laws. In any
emergency exert yourselves in the public service and exhibit voluntarily your
bravery in the cause of order. And by every means assist and promote the pros-
perity of the imperial régime, which is lasting as the heavens and the earth.
Thus you will not only be our loyal subjects and good citizens, but will manifest
the highest and best traditions of your ancestors.
~ Such, then, are the essential phases of the ethics of Japan. They
may be far,from reaching your lofty ideals and expectations, but we
are contented with their general tendency, while at the same time
we do not forget to inculcate the necessary furtherance and expansion
of our ideas required by the changing circumstances of the time.
We are likewise mindful of the desirability of carrying them out in
such a way as not to conflict with the best ideals of any other country,
for our sole aspiration is to preserve harmonious relations with the
whole of mankind.
PLAGUE IN INDIA.

By CHARLES CREIGHTON, M. D.?

Eight years ago the subject of plague in India was brought before
this society in a paper by Mr. Herbert Birdwood, which dealt with
the first epidemic in Bombay city in 1896-97 (Journal, February
28, 189, vol. xvi, p. 305). Mr. Birdwood’s intimate account of
the beginnings of the infection, of its rapid extension, and of the
efforts made to cope with it will remain a document of importance,
both by reason of the fresh impression of so novel an experience in
an Indian city under British rule and also because it was the first
chapter of what is likely to prove a long history. At the date of the
paper a second plague season in Bombay had begun, which proved
to be more disastrous than the first; the cities of Poona and Karachi
were also infected severely, and there were many minor centers
along the whole coast northward to Cutch, and in the transmontane
districts of Satara and Sholapur to the south, as well as two small
spots of plague more than a thousand miles away in the northwest—
one around Hurdwar and the other in villages of the Jullundur
doab. By that time the government of India was naturally alarmed
at a threatened invasion of the whole country, and appointed, in
August, 1898, a commission of five to conduct an investigation spec-
ially defined as of a scientific character, into origins and ways of
spreading, as well as into the mode of treatment by serum inocula-
tion and the mode of prevention by inoculating a solution of dead
bacteria. That commission is now ancient history, so that I am at
liberty to remark that there was not a single epidemiologist upon it,
and that its “ scientific character” was ruined by two causes—first,
because the two medical members who wrote the report put aside
such evidence as did not come within their bacteriological point of
view, and, secondly, because the two departmental members were

disinelined to look into the errers of omissions of sanitation which
had prepared the way for plague, especially in Bombay city.
However, the witnesses contrived to say a good many things, proprio
motu, which make the three volumes of evidence valuable and inter-
esting reading.

PRESENT AREA.

When the commission began its work in November, 1898, the cen-
ters of infection were many and widely scattered, so that sittings to
take evidence were held at places as far apart as Bangalore and
Lahore in one direction, Calcutta and Karachi in the other. But
the infected area was still comparatively small. There was no plague
in the Madras Presidency, none in Bengal excepting at Calcutta, none
in the United Provinces excepting over a small part of the district
of Saharanpur, and none in the Punjab excepting in one small spot of
the Jullundur doab. During the next six years the area has been
extended enormously, but still within notable limits. The Madras
Presidency has continued almost entirely free, and, what is more
remarkable, also the whole of Orissa, Lower Bengal, and Assam.
It is the northwestern plains that have become the chosen seat of
plague, from the Jhelum River in the north to a point on the Ganges
about 300 miles above Calcutta, while the original area in the Bom-
bay Presidency has extended.

Those regions of India which have been proved by an experience
of nine years to be the great seats of plague are shaded on the map.
(Fig. 1.) They look somewhat compact and continuous in two divi-
sions—one the plains of the northwest, the other the alluvial valleys
of the Deccan and Gujarat. This does not profess to be an exhaustive
map of plague. For example, there have been many deaths from first
to last in the native States of Mysore, Hyderabad, Indore, and Rajpu-
tana, and in the British Central Provinces, but far more in the cities,
such as Bangalore, Indore, and Jubbulpore, than in the villages.
Also in Sind, Karachi was not the only place infected at first,
although it remains almost the only place now. If I had shaded
every one of those extensive and sparsely populated tracts of country
where plague has ever been in those years, I should have produced a
confusing, if not a misleading effect. Without being exhaustive,
the blue coloring in the map on the wall shows fairly enough where
the interest really les, and it covers those parts of the Bombay
Presidency and of the northwest to which I limited myself during
a recent tour of three months, which was undertaken at the instance
of the Leigh Browne trust.

SOME FIGURES.

I do not intend to be statistical, but a few round figures may be
given to bear out this coloring of certain regions on the map. First.
as to the dark area in the south of the Bombay Presidency. The three
districts of Satara, Belgaum, and Dharwar, and the native State of
Kolhapur have each returned an almost equal total of plague deaths
during the last four years, viz, 120,000, being an average of 30,009 a

year for each in a population of about a million. The adjoining dis-
trict of Bijapur had over 20,000 in each of the two last seasons, while
Sholapur and Khandesh have each had one season of 25,000 in the
more recent period. But in the Punjab those large annual totals have
been exceeded in several districts. .Sialkote had 50,000 deaths the sea-
son before last, Ludhiana almost the same number three years ago,
ole PLAGUE IN INDIA.

Gujranwala 30,000 last year, and 45,000 the year before, while the old-
est centers of infection in the Punjab, the adjacent districts of Jul-
lunder and Hoshiarpur have shown a steady increase for three years
running, reaching last year to 30,000 plague deaths in the one and
25,000 in the other, with the promise of quite as many this season
when the returns are completed. For a single week last year in the
end of April or the beginning of May, which is the height of the
plague season in the Punjab, four of the districts returned 4.000 each,
while half a dozen more returned from 2,000 to 3,000. In the United
Provinces until this year no district has come near to those enormous
weekly maxima; but at length Muttra has reached 4,000 plague
deaths in a week, while Ghazipur and Agra have each had a highest
weekly total of about 1,600. In Behar the worst district has been
Saran, the poorest and most crowded part of India, which has
reached 2,000 a week, while two or three other districts of the same
Patna division have had each over 1,000 a week at the height of the
plague season. Last year the plague deaths in all India totaled over
a million, of which nearly 400,000 came from the villages of the
Punjab and 300,000 from the villages of the Bombay Presidency.
Last year the worst week was that ending the 2d of April, with a
total of 46,320 plague deaths. This year the week ending the Ist of
April had a total of 57,702, the increase being more than accounted
for by the unusual severity of the infection in certain districts of the
Agra Province, and in the adjoming districts of the Delhi division of
the Punjab, as well as by the extension of area eastward in Behar.

PLAGUE AN OLD AND WELL-UNDERSTOOD INFECTION.

To an epidemiologist this enormous prevalence of plague steadily
from year to year among the rural population of India is perhaps the
most remarkable phenomenon in his science. It is all the more re-
markable that we have never thought of India as a great seat of
plague in former times, such as Lower Egypt, Syria, and Irak had
been during many centuries of Mohammedan rule, and that we were
beginning to look upon plague as a thing of the past everywhere. In
writing the article on “ Quarantine” for the Encyclopedia Britan-
nica twenty years ago I gave nearly all the space to vellow fever and
cholera, remarking of plague that “ for many years it has ceased to
have any practical interest in this connection,” although it had been
the original object of all the quarantine laws of Europe. And to
show that I was not singular the paragraph on port quarantine in
the Bombay Sanitary Commissioner’s Report for 1887 has this sen-
tence: “ Plague and yellow fever have never to my knowledge existed
in Bombay, and are not in present circumstances ever likely to be
there met with ” (T. G. Hewlett, Ll. ¢., p. 82). The outbreak in Bom-
PLAGUE IN INDIA. ailtes

bay nine years ago was a surprise; but the greatest surprise of all, in
a historical sense, has been the endemic settlement of the infection in
the plains. This is, indeed, a real novelty of the present situation to
epidemiologists, as well as a very serious practical matter; but for the
rest plague is a very ancient disease, and, I take leave to say, very
well known in its type and in its habits to those who are competent in
such matters. There is just as little mystery about plague and just
as much as there is about cholera, or yellow fever, or typhus, or en-
teric, and there is actually less mystery about it than about those
everyday domestic incidents, measles and scarlatina. What, then,
is the meaning of the claptrap about “ our ignorance of plague? ”
So far as I can understand it has arisen from the fashion which the
public and the newspapers have adopted of thinking bacterially about
diseases. Bacteriologists, when asked to explain plague, are found
to be not so lucid as usual. They are at fault in the pursuit of the
bacillus outside the body. It runs to earth and gets lost in a crowd
of other bacteria in the soil, or disguises itself as a saprophytic mold,
or perishes outright in the struggle for existence, although there is
no doubt about the infection remaining in the ground all the same.
Hence, perhaps, the impression that more bacteriology is necessary
before anything practical can be done. .

RECENT SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS.

As plague is not found to be contagious from person to person
except in its pneumonic variety, everyone sees that the interest must
center in the infection outside the body. In that connection research
in India has added only two novelties to the older body of doctrine,
both of them of the minor kind. No one can deny, although some
would if they could, that the regular way of receiving the infection of
plague is by the breath; but inasmuch as rats in a laboratory can be
made to take plague, or something like it, by inserting a culture of
bacilli at a puncture of the skin, so it is sought to prove that there
may be something corresponding in human experience. One theory
started in India is that the infection may enter through wounds
of the feet, as the people of that country so often uncover their feet
ceremonially and so many of them go barefoot for want of shoes.
This theory is of course inapplicable to European plague, for exam-
ple, the great plague of London in 1665. But there is another theory
devised to give moral support to the inoculation experiment on rats,
which implicates the rat himself; it is that the fleas which infest
the rat may introduce infection through flea bites on the human skin.
The Austrian plague commission, which was the first in the field at
Bombay in 1897, had already considered whether mosquitoes might

sm 1905 24

314 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

not carry plague infection, for example, in the plague hospital
(where they abounded), from a patient to a nurse; but they found
that it was not so, although everyone was bitten.

Various other insects were next thought of, and at length the
interest has centered in fleas as possible carriers of infection from
the rat. Researches of a very minute and technical kind were started
by this hypothesis on the lines of the well-known microscopic
researches on mosquitoes. Captain Liston has conducted, in India,
a large amount of research upon the fleas which infest the rat. The
question next arises whether those are the same species of fleas which
produce the human flea-bites; then there is the question whether those
who take plague had been bitten by fleas in matter of fact; and,
lastly, the question of microbes in the fleas. All this is, no doubt,
a very promising field of academic inquiry; and I am given to under-
stand that the scientific expedition which has been announced with a
flourish of trumpets as about to proceed to India “ to make a thorough
investigation into the causes and origin of plague” is really going
out to work in the laboratory at Kasauh, with a view to settlng
all those open questions in the hypothesis of flea-bites.

PLAGUE LOCALITIES.

Just as in a well-known paper read before a certain scientific club,
“the theory of tittlebats ” was jomed naturally to their habitat, the
Hampstead Ponds, so I would wish to pass, with no abrupt transition,
from the bacteriology of plague to the localities of it. Before 1!
started on my recent expedition, I spent several months in getting up
the gazetteers of the districts which I meant to visit, partly to become
acquainted with a strange country and partly to note any facts as to
population, poverty, kind of soil, height of ground water, canal irri-
gation, rainfall, or the like, which might throw hght upon the inei-
dence of plague upon some localities rather than on others. There
was probably some reason why the villages of lower Bengal should
have escaped plague absolutely, while those of Behar have had several
bad seasons of it, or why the districts of Oudh should have had so
much less plague than those of the Agra province, or why the Punjab
districts of Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur have each lost 80,000 by it,
but the district of Kangra none, although it has an incessant traffic
with them by the old and new Dharmsala roads. But the contrast
which seemed, on paper. to be the best worth investigating was that
between the Bombay coast districts-of Kolaba and Ratnagiri, and the
districts across the Ghats from Satara to Dharwar.
PLAGUE IN INDIA. 315
PLAGUE-FREE VILLAGES OF THE KONKAN.

Take for comparison the district of Ratnagiri and the adjoining
district of Satara. The coast district might seem to be in some respects
the more hable of the two; it has a denser population, there is a con-
stant traffic of the people between it and Bombay City (which is said
to contain 100,000 natives of Ratnagiri, working class and middle
class), and it is as much an agricultural district as Satara, with about
the same number of village communities and one-third more houses
per square mile. Again, in matter of fact, plague has been intro-
duced into the numerous small harbors along the coast dozens of times.
But it has never taken.hold of the villages, and has been so little in-
digenous in the coast places that the annual average of deaths for the
whole district from first to last has been only 400, while that of
Satara for the last four years has been nearly 30,000.

Clearly there is something in the Ratnagiri villages unfavorable to
plague, and something in the Satara villages peculiarly favorable to it.
I have visited both, and shall give briefly what I believe to be the
relevant points of difference. The Konkan is a rocky region. Look-
ing down upon it in that magnificent view from one of the “ points ”
of Mahableshwar, one might take it to be a great barren land of red
rock, but after descending some miles by the zigzag mountain road,
one comes to patches of cultivation and to scattered hamlets, and at
the end of 25 miles to a large village surrounded by cultivated fields.

The map of the district shows that there are many such villages
hidden in the foldings of the hills, and built usually along a stream.
.My notes relate to a village on the Savitri River, 9 miles from the
316 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

creek of the sea in which it ends. Everything is built of stone.
There is an extensive ghat of dressed stone with steps down to a pool
of the river. Facing the ghat is the village bazaar, the roadway
paved with stone, the houses of one, two, or three stories with stone
walls and tiled roofs, raised some 4 or 5 feet above the road on plinths
of dressed stone, and sometimes with stone steps below the plinths;
the houses of the bazaar in a continuous row with doors close to-
gether, but the rest of the village more dispersed along the main
road and side roads, at one point forming a hamlet, while another
part of the village is in scattered houses across the river. The
ground-floor rooms are as dark as they usually are in India, with a fire
burning on the floor at the far end. The cattle are usually in the
house, or in a veranda, but sometimes in a shed of the small compound.

So far as concerned the want of light and air, and the keeping of
‘attle indoors, these Konkan
village houses did not seem
to be worse or better than
elsewhere. Their masonry
construction, their high
plinths and paved roadways

the more open order of their
houses and small home-
steads, which may extend
a mile or more along one or both sides of a stream, some villages hav-
ing only one long paved street with a'row of houses on either side,
like many of our own villages. This pecuharity of the Konkan vil-
lages can be seen everywhere upon the large scale maps of the
Kolaba and Ratnagiri districts (fig. 2). On the scale of 1 inch to
the mile it is possible to show the extent of the village site more
accurately than by the conventional dot or small circle or ordinary
maps. This lantern slide shows a bit of Ratnagiri district around
the head of one of the numerous creeks which run up.20 miles from
the sea. It will be observed that the small squares, or rhombs, or
other geometrical figures, by which cartographers indicate home-
steads or clusters of houses, are peppered all over the surface, so that
the houses of one village along a stream almost join on to those of.

the village above or below it. Toward the southern end of the dis-
trict the villages break up definitely into scattered hamlets.

What has been said of Ratnagiri is true equally of the State of
Sawantwari adjoining it, which has had only 5 plague deaths several
years ago, besides some 50 deaths among fugitives from neighboring
plague districts. Also the Portuguese territory of Goa, with a far
denser country population than any of the British districts to the east
of the Ghats, but scattered in innumerable small clusters of houses or
bamboo huts beside their gardens and fruit groves, is reported to have
had no plague, although it 1s in constant communication with Bombay
by sea and with Dharwar and Belgaum by hill roads and the railway.

below the carriage road. After passing through the plague-stricken

these Satara villages, as I have others from districts farther south.
But the type is the same in all those black-soil valleys of the Deccan
watered by the Krishna and its numerous affluents. What Sir
Thomas More said of the towns of his medizeval Utopia may be said
of them:

Whoso knoweth one of them knoweth them all, they be all so like one to
another, as far forth as the nature of the place permitteth.

They are all mud villages inclosed within a ring fence of bushes,
sometimes with gates and remains of a wall. Many of them are
large, with populations up to 4,000 or over, comparatively few of
those that recur in the plague lists having their population, as given
on the margin, under four figures. In the first season of plague
among them, 1898, some villages lost more than a fourth part of their
inhabitants in two or three months. Thus the village of Shelwad1,
taluka of Navalgund, district of Dharwar, with a population of
4,222, had 1,126 plague deaths in eight weeks of October, November,
and December. In the following table I have taken out the figures
for a cluster of seven villages in the taluka of Hubli, to show the
severity of their first plague season and the extent to which they have
suffered in subsequent years:

Two villages which I visited, one 12 miles from Belgaum, the other
7 miles from Dharwar, will serve as samples of the large villages in
the black-soil basin of the Krishna, each of them having had five epi-
demics in the course of seven years.

A BELGAUM VILLAGE.

The Belgaum village was considered a rich one, the bulk of the
cultivators being prosperous Lingayats. The population in 1891 had
been 4,586, it had an area of 2,600 acres, and it was the cattle market
for the extensive pastures on the hills and downs to the northwest.
The 800 houses of the village covered 64 acres, about 600 of them occu-
pied by Lingayats and other castes of Hindus, 200 by Mohammedan
butchers and cattle dealers in a separate quarter. It was inclosed by a
PLAGUE IN INDIA. 319

ring of bushes, outside which was the invariable mudhole or so-called
tank, with the Hindu burning ghat and the Mohammedan burial
place on its high bank. The houses stood upon a series of slight ele-
vations and declivities, in fairly wide streets or lanes; they were close
together in rows, but there was no extreme congestion. They were
nearly all built of mud upon earthen foundations, but some were raised
a foot or two on stone plinths, and had a few courses of stone in their
walls above the plinths; the stone being procurable from a quarry im
a hill 3 miles distant. As it was the dry season, there was much dust
everywhere, and a general look of sordidness unrelieved by a single
amenity excepting an occasional carved doorway and two or three
verandas. Some of the houses had been rebuilt within a few years,
one last year on the old foundations. Some had considerable back
yards, very ill kept, but most had no curtilage whatever. Yet in a
perambulation of the village site one met with nothing strikingly
offensive to sight or smell.

There had been 147 deaths from plague from August to October,
but no new cases for six weeks, and the only evidence of the recent
visitation was a number of padlocked doors. This outbreak was the
fifth since 1898, and the slightest hitherto. IT have compiled from
the records the following table, showing the whole history of plague
in this village:

The enormous loss of life in 1899—over 700—was felt in the census
of 1901, which showed a great reduction from that of 1891, and the ag-
eregate loss of two-fifths of the population in seven years must have
left a good many housesempty. I examined only two of these, in which
there had been deaths a few weeks before. They were both old and
crumbling, built of sheer mud, without plinths, standing side to side
on a slight declivity of the main street. Each consisted of a single
square room, without window or back door, with an oil mill occupy-
ing the center of the worn earthen floor, the occupants of both having
320 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

been oilmen. The party wall between them was of mud, only 6 or 7
feet high, and crumbling at the top, so that the houses were open to
each other across the whole pitch of the begrimed roof. Plague
deaths had occurred in both, and in one of them five had died out of
a family of six. There were several other padlocked doors on the
opposite side of the street and at intervals in the rows of houses else-
where. Most of the houses, I was told, had been visited in one or
other of the five epidemics, those which escaped in one season being
invaded in another, whilst some houses had had the infection in them
time after time.

While the infection had crept about to all parts of this village site,
it was the unanimous opinion that it always began in a certain quar-
ter, the high ground on the northern side, next to the high road,
which was the particular quarter of the Mohammedan butchers and
rattle dealers. The Lingayat cultivators had a bitter grievance
against their Mussulman neighbors, which they tried to interest me
in, having mistaken me for a person of authority. Slaughtering of
cattle, sheep,.and goats, curing of meat for the Bombay market,
dressing of hides, and the like, were the chief industries of that
quarter of the village. There was no regular slaughterhouse, but
each householder used his house or the space before or behind it
for killing in, the flayed carcases and skins being in evidence as one
walked past; and of course the whole soil of this elevated corner of
the village was saturated with the blood and offal of many years an<l
swarmed with rats, as shambles always do. A year or two before, the
sanitary inspector from Belgaum, a native official of the third rank,
had made a report upon the nuisance, recommending that the Moham-
medans should be removed to a new site outside the village, which
could have been found for them with the greatest ease not far off;
but the commissioner had not moved in the matter, and the anger of
the Lingayat farmers was unappeased.

A DHARWAR VILLAGE.

I shall take next a somewhat different sample of these villages,
which also has had five epidemics of plague in the last seven years,
but not so severe, and curiously enough always three or four months
later in the season, as this table shows:

This village was a purely agricultural one, with no cattle trade,
which is the common type on the rich black plain, or desh, extending
sastward from Dharwar. The road all the way from the city
passed through an unbroken expanse of wheat, jowar, and cotton,
many of the wheat fields being of 20 acres. The area of the village
in question was about 2,000 acres, but much of it was in the hands of
a few large farmers. The patel of the village, a headman in stature
as well as in name, farmed 100 acres, another resident farmed 200,
and several who were resident in Dharwar City were also large own-
ers and occupiers. About a fourth part of the villagers were labor-
ers who held no land, many having lost it by mortgaging to the
wealthier villagers or to pleaders in Dharwar, who had thus acquired
their large farms. The village had once been defended by a wall
and still retained two gates. Although it contained a number of
well-to-do farmers, it did not contain a single pakka dwelling house. —
The houses were all of mud, many of them raised about a foot above
the road on plinths of stone, which was got from a hill overlooking
the village on the north. There was only one masonry structure—a
variegatel marble hall with open-top galleries for public meetings,
which had been built recently by subscription. The streets or lanes
were fairly wide, unpaved, and deep in dust. Few of the houses had
verandas, and they were all equally common or mean. The usual
ground plan was three rooms, one behind the other, with a back door
opposite the street door, but without windows, the cattle being kept in
the apartment next the street. All round the backs of the houses ran
a space which was inclosed in places, traversed by not overclean foot-
paths and overgrown with bushes; but in the dry weather it was not
uotably filthy, and there appeared to be-no particular need for what
is called village sanitation; at least, one did not see where the sanita-
tion was to begin, so long as the streets were unpaved, and the whole
village, except the marble hall, built of mud. At the date of my visit
in December the fifth epidemic of plague had only just begun, but it

appears from the subsequent printed returns that 14 died of plague in
December and 18 in January, while a continuance until March was
probable, according to precedent.

PLAGUE VILLAGES OF THE NORTHWEST.

Time will not allow me to describe in detail other plague villages,
and I regret especially that I must pass over the much better type of
village in Gujarat, in which the houses are mostly built of brick (but
sometimes repaired with mud), raised on plinths, commodious, and
not without traces of taste. Leaving the Bombay Presidency, and
coming next to the northwest, which is now by far the worst seat
of plague, the many thousands of villages which have had the infec-
tion in them are of a very uniform type. As one goes westward,
the compact fort-like aggregate of mud walls and flat roofs becomes
more distinctive, and throughout the whole of the Punjab that is the
type. We have left behind the more open and irregular formation of
the small Bengali village, with clumps of trees or bushes between
the several homesteads, patches of kitchen garden among the trees,
and creepers overrunming the verandas. High-pitched tiled roofs
succeed, and after these thatched roofs with broad drooping eaves,
until at length we come west of Allahabad to the naked mud walls
and flat roofs of the northwest, without a single amenity that the
eye can rest on, and in many cases without even a tree beside the
village well. The interior of these villages is not unlike that which
I have already described for districts of the south, but the houses are
often huddled together, with narrow, winding lanes between the rows,
and sometimes in compact blocks, back to back and side to side, with
no intervals at all. I shall take an extreme instance from a large and
wealthy village of Jullundur. Jullundur is one of the most fortu-
nately situated districts of the Punjab, and its villagers are proverbi-
ally well satisfied with their lot in hfe. They have a soil renowned
for its fertility, and they have water so easily reached by wells wher-
ever they may sink them, that they can dispense with irrigation
canals, and need not pay 2 or 3 rupees an acre for watering their
crops. If they are poor, it is because the pressure of population is
ereat, being, indeed, about 600 to the square mile, and the highest
in the Punjab; but the signs of poverty, or at all events of distress,
are not at all obvious to the passer-by, and the people are of good
physique. The district was the first in the Punjab to be infected
with plague, and in the last four years it has lost 100,000 by that
cause; at the time of my visit, those who were dying were said to be
robust men and women in the flower of their age.
PLAGUE IN INDIA. plo

A PLAGUE VILLAGE OF JULLUNDUR.

The particular village which I am about to describe had a past his-
tory of plague, but IT am unsble to give it, as the Punjab government
does not tabulate and print its returns from villages, as the Bom-
bay government has done from the beginning. Its population was
about 3,000, and it had lost about 250 by plague in the months of
March and April preceding (1904). The greater number of those
deaths had come from a square block of houses (and from one or more
like it) which had the most remarkable construction that I saw any-
where in India. It was literally a hive of some thirty or forty mud
cells. A narrow passage ran around the square, with doors at inter-
vals in the dead wall. Entering by a door near a corner of the
square one came into a room, which somehow held a cow or bullock
us well as the family, and had a hatch-like opening in the flat roof
with a ladder to ascend by. On reaching the roof one found that 1
was a continuous expanse of thirty or forty small squares like those
of a chessboard, marked off from each other only by ridges of mud,
which one had to step across in walking a distance of some thirty or
forty yards to descend by another ladder at the opposite corner.
Each of the thirty or forty square roofs had a round hole in the
middle, invariably covered by an earthenware cap like an inverted
lowerpot. Close to this mud block, separated from it only by the
(-foot passage, was a group of ten or fifteen brick houses two and
three stories high, with windows, balconies, and the usual features
of the pakka houses of towns; this was the only masonry quarter of
the village, holding about a twentieth of the population. I could not
learn whether its residents had escaped altogether the infection which
was so violent in the mud block next to it, but it was certain that most
of the plague cases had been in the latter, or in another like it,
some cells being pointed out in which as many as four persons had
died. Most or all of the apartments were now retenanted, and there
had been no sign of a revival of the infection down to the middle of
January last. In another village, at the other end of Jullundur dis-
trict, I mounted the roof of a block of houses in the Mohammedan
quarter, thinking to find a continuous expanse like the former, but in
that instance there were cattle pens and one or two alleys in the midst
olit:

PLAGUE IN THE NEW VILLAGES OF THE CHENAB COLONY.

Having been told that the new regulation villages of the Chenab
and Jhelum colonies had had plague in them equally with the old
Punjab villages, which was not at all what one would have expected
in recently occupied sites, I visited both colonies to see how the matter
324 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

really stood. I found from the printed figures of 1904 that the dis-
trict of Jhang, which included fully three-fourths of the Chenab
colony (now the Lyallpur district) had had 4,000 deaths from plague,
nearly all in April and May, 1904, which was only a tithe of the rate
of other Punjab districts equally populous, and that the southern tah-
sil of Gujranwala, which included the rest of the new Chenab villages,
had had far less plague than the three other tahsils, where the villages
were old. Still, there had been plague in the new villages, one
of those which I visited having had 30 deaths in the month of
December, 1903, with a prospect of more if the villagers had not
cleared out into the jungle, and another near it, but built two
years earlier, before the regulation plan was adopted, having had 60
deaths. There are more than 1,000 such new villages in the Chenab
colony, which have been built within the last twelve or thirteen years.
The colonists are in great part retired sepoys of the Sikh regiments,
with their subadars, or native officers, as the lumbardars of villages.
Sepoys received grants of 18 acres, some officers a square of 28 acres,
others two such squares, paying a small land tax, as well as so much
per acre for the use of the canal water for irrigating their fields. The
land is now nearly all taken up, and is producing heavy crops of
wheat, cotton, and sugar, the export of wheat from this district being
one of the largest from India, as the railway traffic showed.

The regulation village which I visited, about 6 miles across country
from the railway, was a great improvement in some respects upon the
ordinary hugger-mugger of an old Punjabi village. It was laid out
in regular squares with wide roads between. The compounds were
roomy, with the dwelling houses kept apart from the cattle sheds. A
certain elevation had been prescribed for all dwelling houses, perhaps
10 feet or more, just as our own local boards have raised the height of
all new country cottages. But the public works department had left
the colonists a free hand in the matter of building materials, and they
had built their villages of sheer mud. In the village I am referring
to there was not a single kiln-burnt brick, except in the facing of the
village well, and, so far as I could see, there were not even sun-dried
bricks in the walls of houses. The whole village was a hasty pudding
of crude mud walls, some of which were already cracked. When I
asked to see some house in which there had been plague, I was shown
a closed door a few feet behind the chair of state in which I was seated
at the crossroads of the village. It was a small corner house or shop,
apparently a single room without a window, in which two cooks had
died of plague. The mud wall was cracked in places and had one or
two round holes in it which looked suspiciously like rat holes. All
the new villages of the colony are built of mud, except those few
which have the good fortune to be stations on the railway.
PLAGUE IN INDIA. 325

PLAGUE IN THE OLD VILLAGES OF SHAHPUR.

The other irrigation colony, between the Chenab and the Jhelum
rivers, is now being planted throughout the jungle of Shahpur dis-
trict, following the lines of the Jhelum Canal. Last year Shahpur
had the enormous mortality of 33,000 from plague among 524,000
people, most of it in the time of the wheat harvest. I suppose that
some small part of it occurred in the new villages, but if the instances
which I saw were fair samples most of it must have come from old
villages, of which there are many within the valley of the Jhelum,
depending, as of old, on wells and on the rainfall for their harvests.
The three villages which I saw at close quarters were within a few
miles of each other, all raised conspicuously above the dead level of
the plain on conical mounds of black earth. Their mud houses cov-
ered the sides and summit of these mounds, which were doubtless
formed by the débris of former villages upon the same site, and may
have been growing by accretions of rubbish ever since the time when
Alexander overthrew Porus on a battlefield not many miles distant.
They looked the filthiest and most dilapidated villages that I had
seen anywhere, and were credibly said to be swarming with rats.
Each of them had lost about a fourth part of the population by
plague the year before.

Before I leave the villages, which have nine-tenths of all the prac-
tical interest for plague, I will give a few minutes to two questions
about them. First, is there any real need or excuse for all this mud
building? and, secondly, are the large, compact, fort-like villages nec-
essary and likely to continue ?

MUD WALLS.

First, as to the almost universal mud walls and roofs in the north-
west. In the Punjab districts which suffer the extremes of heat and
cold, the excuse is made that mud walls are the coolest in the hot
weather and the warmest in the cold. But the more general explana-
tion is undoubtedly the ease and small cost with which mud houses
can be run up. On that point I may be permitted to quote a few
sentences by the late Mr. Frederick Growse, who gave much attention
to Indian architecture and did much to revive the native building arts
in his collectorate of Bulandshar.

Replying to a circular of the year 1888 on the question of village
sanitation, he wrote:

Under such supervision an ordinary Indian yillage would in the course of a
few years be less repulsive in appearance than it is at present, but I doubt
whether the death returns would be materially reduced. * * * The real
scourge of the country is fever. This is felt all the year round, and will con-
326 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

tinue to be so until the people adopt a more rational style of house building.
At present the ordinary mode of procedure is to dig a pit, and with the clay
extracted from it to raise a wall on its margin and roof it over for a habitation,
the floor either remaining several feet below the surface of the ground outside
or being partly filled up with the first rubbish that comes to hand. * * *
In no country, however barbarous, is such a style of building in vogue. It has
been adopted in these provinces on account of the tenacity of the ordinary clay
soil, which thus lends itself readily to the purpose. But if in other countries,
where poverty is as much felt as in India, building materials have invariably
to be brought from a distance, the same necessity should be recognized here.
Again, referring to the district of Fatehpur, he says:

Thus for want of skilled labor the villages are all exceptionally mean-looking
collections of mud hovels, and the towns which sprang up under the Oudh
Nawabs are all in decay. * * * If the standard of living is low, it is more
so from habit than from absolute lack of means; large sums are yearly expended
on the only public works which a Hindoo ordinariy recognizes, hamely, temples
and bathing tanks.

The alluvium of the whole northwest makes a sufficiently tenacious
clay, and the black soil of the Deccan valleys is even more sticky.
The former can easily be burnt into bricks, while there is always red
soil suited for brickmaking, or a stone quarry at no great distance
from the black cotton soil. When I asked the lumbardar of one of
the new villages in the Chenab colony, ‘“* Why do you not have pakk:
houses? ” he answered, “ We are very poor men.” But,as Mr. Growse
said, the poor standard of living is more from habit than absolute
lack of means; other countries, where poverty is as much felt as in
India (and more felt than in the Chenab colony), employ village
masons and carpenters, and they have shown their progress in well-
being first of all in the improved housing of the peasantry. This
has been the recognized test in Ireland in the last fifty years, and
in Scotland the great advance in the latter part of the eighteenth
century was shown in nothing so much as the disappearance of such
“auld clay biggins,” as Burns was born in. Yet in India mud vil-
lages have entered on a new lease under the auspices of the public
works department.

SANITARY ADVANTAGES OF HAMLETS.

As to the large, compact, fort-like villages which are »eculiarly
the seats of plague infection, it passes as an axiom in India that
small villages and hamlets may be almost left to take care of them-
selves in a sanitary respect. The axiom is embodied in the Govern-
ment Revenue Handbook, and it recurs time after time in the rephes
to two circulars on village sanitation issued in 1888 and 1893. What
was thus obvious in times of cholera is not less obvious in the present
time of plague. The advantages of hamlets are even more marked
in the latter, for the Bheels of western Khandesh, who were among
PLAGUE IN INDIA. Bare

the chief victims of cholera in the last famine, are said never to have
plague in their rude hamlets or movable camps, although the infee-
tion has been disastrous in the settled villages of eastern Khandesh.
The same escape from plague of small and movable hamlets was
remarked by Colvill in his tour through the plague districts of Meso-
potomia in 1874. The trouble always and everywhere has been from
crowded sites too long inhabited without drainage. The more com-
pact the site or the greater the congestion of houses upon it the more
will the soil be filled with organic impurities. It is well known that
soil has the property of breaking up organic matters by oxidation and
nitrification; that it filters off and retains organic substances sus-
pended or dissolved in water, arrests the action of ferments, and
retains bacteria in its upper layers. But if the upper stratum be
saturated with organic matters beyond the power of the soil to enter
into combination with them, each new accretion sinks down more
or less slowly to the deeper layers unchanged, there to undergo putre-
faction or reduction by ferments, so that beyond a certain point the
self-cleansing action of the soil breaks down. The limit of endurance
is passed constantly in old inhabited sites, whereas in fields pastured
by cattle or sheep or manured for cropping the wholesome chemistry
of the soil goes on from season to season without check. That the
infection of plague resides in the ground is now accepted by every
practical man in India who has been on plague duty, and is perceived
intuitively by the people themselves.

CENTERS OF PLAGUE IN OUDH.

Such being the correct scientific theory of plague, one may find in it
one reason why those parts of India which have the rural population
least congested in particular spots should have had little plague or
none. I have given the instance of the Konkan somewhat fully and
have a few remarks to make about Oudh. The Oudh landscape is
always pleasing. There are other provinces, such as Gujarat, which
may dispute with Oudh the title to be the Garden of India, but it is
certainly the garden of the northwestern plains. It is the province
of hamlets or small villages and of a resident nobility and gentry.
Plague has not been absent from Oudh, for two or three of the dis-
iricts in the south and east, along the Ganges, have had large mor-
talities. As the government of the United Provinces does not print
full details of the villages infected with plague, one has to find out
by personal inquiry, and I was advised to choose Fyzabad as a char-
acteristic part of Oudh. In the week before, that district had re-
turned 110 deaths from plague, and the question was, What kind of
villages did these come from? One of the four tahsils of the district
had to be taken as a sample, and the Fyzabad tahsil was the most
328 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

convement. It appeared that a full half of all the plague deaths in
it were being returned by one village, 10 miles from the city, which
I went to see, accompanied by the tahsildar. It was a large market
village of over 4,000 people and 700 houses, with very little agricul-
ture (chiefly sugar cane) and much cattle trade, more than half the
population being Mohammedans. The Sanitary Inspection Book,
one of those ordered by Government circular of 1893 to be kept in
large villages, contained at various dates severe strictures upon the
squalid conditions, especially of 2 of its 9 mahallas, and remarks
on the slaughtering of cattle by certain butchers in their houses, and
on the common practice of killing sheep and goats in dwelling houses.
There had been plague in it two years ago, and at the time of our visit
one whole quarter of the village was evacuated, owing to dead rats
having been found and to plague cases thereafter. This quarter
consisted of the same two mahallas which had been censured as
specially squalid long before plague appeared. There had been 65
deaths so far and two fresh cases that day. The other chief center of
plague in the tahsil was also a large market village, with a population
chiefly Mohammedan. A few other villages had been returning
plague deaths, but none of them more than 10 in all, and it did not
appear that any of the hamlets had plague. The largest purely
agricultural village, with 1,600 people and 2,400 acres, of which fully
half were cultivated, was distributed in 10 hamlets and had no
plague. On an average the Oudh districts have had hardly more
than a third as much plague per head of population as the districts
of the Agra province, a ratio which is inversely as the number of
hamlets and is most probably dependent thereon.

HAMLETS V. LARGE VILLAGES.

Are there any reasons why the more wholesome kind of country
jife which is found in Oudh should not be extended to other parts of
the northwest? I quote a few sentences to show that the plan or
type of large compact villages is neither ancient nor immovably fixed
even now. In the Gazetteer, of Muzaffarnagar, it is stated:

When Sikh, Rohilla, Gujar, and Marhatta together, or in turn, ravaged the
district, no small community could exist, and the settlers fell back on the strong
villages from which they had gone forth. After the final pacification in 1805,
colonies were again sent out, but so gradually that the beginning of not a few
flourishing villages is still remembered.

Again, as to the tendency to return to hamlets and their sanitary
advantages, Mr. Adams, formerly collector of Benares, wrote in 1888:

The sanitary commissioner has not, I think, taken note of the manner in
which, in many parts of these provinces, the villages are splitting up. The
villagers in old days clustered together for mutual protection, but now they find
they can live close to their fields, and hamlets have sprung up all over the
country.
PLAGUE IN INDIA. 329

But they are not springing up in the black soil valleys of the Dec-
ean, nor in the Punjab, except in cases of feud between one part of
a village and another; and it will appear from what I am about to
read, from the pen of Mr. Alan Cadell, that there are reasons why the
large villages should remain large:

The crowding of the population into large villages is to a certain extent dis-
udvantageous, but the power which the large cultivating communities have
acquired from their numbers and their wealth is of great service to them in
resisting the encroachments of the landlords; and the people must feel that
they would lose in unity and defensive power if they were scattered over several
hamlets instead of being collected together in the old ancestral village. The
fact, too, that nearly all the best land is held by occupancy tenants, whose fields
are situated all over two and even three estates, makes it still more unlikely
that any large number of tenants will leave their present dwellings, for to do
so would, while bringing them nearer some fields, take them away farther than
before from others, and to effect changes of hereditary fields is always difficult
and generally impossible.

PLAGUE IN THE CITIES.

The circumstances of Bombay are so special, if not unique, that it
would take a whole hour to discuss them. Therefore I shall not
begin upon them, however inviting the theme. Poona, infected from
Bombay, has had severe plague every season for nine years, and more
of it per head of population than Bombay itself; the sanitary prob-
lem is complex there also, and can not even be stated in a sentence
or two. Karachi and Caleutta I did not visit. I will come to Benares,
as a good sample of the northwestern cities.

BENARES.

The mahallas or wards into which Benares is divided fall into
two classes—the pakka, or masonry mahals, and the kaccha, or mud
mahals. The separation of the two is sharper, I believe, than in
any other Indian city, and will be readily understood from the
situation of the masonry mahals. They are that famous range of
houses, temples, and terraces which crowns the high bank of the
Ganges for a space of nearly 2 miles. Some 50,000 or 60,000 of the
population are housed there, and twice as many more in the kaccha
or mud-built suburbs which extend back from the riverside quarter
over a radius of 2 or 3 miles. These kaccha mahals, however,
are not all equally mean in construction; for example, the road,
3 miles long, which runs from near the cantonment to the railway
bridge over the Ganges is lined on both sides all the way with
houses or shops of brick raised on plinths. The pakka mahals along
the river are built of stone which had been brought some 20
miles down the Ganges, from the extensive quarries near Mirzapur.

sm 1905——25
330 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

There are no carriage ways through this region, but only a maze
of narrow alleys, with houses on either hand three or four stories
high, and innumerable temples—a perfect rabbit warren, like the
closes of the High street, Canongate, and Cowgate of Old Edinburgh.
What strikes one most in the not unexciting passage through this
maze is the solidity and durability of the structure everywhere.
The walls are of stone, the courtyards and floors are paved with
stone, the alleys are laid crosswise with long slabs of stone, which
form at the same time the roofs of a network of sewers. In this
dense mass of humanity, constantly mixing with pilgrims from all
parts of India, there has been hardly any plague. I make this state-
ment on the authority of the police inspector who accompanied me,
as well as of the collector, Mr. Radice, who wrote as follows: “ In
the five years we have had plague (this is the fifth) the pakka mahals
have been almost entirely free;” and in the sketch plan showing the
incidence of the infection on the several quarters of the city, which

he was good enough to make for me, he has marked only one small
spot in the riverside quarter, the Gaighat, which had some plague in
1903. On the other hand, the mud-built suburbs and the villages to
the west of the city have had much plague; for example, this year a
maximum of nearly 400 deaths in a week in March. In driving
through them one could tell at a glance where the plague was likely
to have been; thus, on the way from the cantonment to the city,
a certain aip in the read is lined on both sides with mud houses of
exceptionally mean appearance, which is found, on reference to the
plan, to be the Tihabagh, marked as having had plague * every
year.

CITIES OF THE NORTHWEST.

In all the other cities of the northwest, which have had much
plague, there are extensive quarters of mud-built houses—in Alla-
habad, Cawnpore, Agra, Lucknow, Bareilly. In Lucknow, beauti-
fied as it is with palaces and fine houses, the relative extent of the
kaeccha mahals seemed to be enormous, and the mud walls of so dusty
and friable a kind that the heavy rain of December had been break-
ing them down. Lucknow this year has had up to 480 plague deaths
in a week, a ratio higher than Bombay. TI shall give a single illus-
tration of plague in Agra. One of the patients in the plague hospi-
tal, a convalescent, was a little girl, the sole survivor of a plague-
stricken family of nine. On proceeding with the assistant medical
officer to see the house where this tragedy had happened, we found
it to be a dilapidated and abandoned mud hut, one of a compact group
of three standing at the roadside on the edge of a small pit, from
which the earth to build them had doubtless been dug.

PLAGUE IN INDIA. Dom

The three large cities of the Punjab— Delhi, Amritsar, and Lahore
have had remarkably little plague. Delhi, which is situated in a
stony region, appeared to be nearly all pakka built, with the excep-
tion of a few lanes around a celebrated black mosque of the fourteenth
century; and even the villages round Delhi are built of a kind of
conglomerate of stone and clay. Amritsar also is a well-built brick
city, and in Lahore there are no such extensive quarters of mud-
built houses as in Allahabad and Lucknow. The smaller towns and
market villages have in some instances furnished a large part of all
the plague deaths credited to a rural area. I was told by the civil
surgeon at Ghazipur that the largest totals in his district this year
were coming in from certain towns or market centers which had a
considerable Mohammedan population; and in the district of Mut-
tra I saw for myself two such market towns with much plague: in
them, one of them, population of 9,000, having had 400 deaths in the
four weeks preceding, and a maximum of 25 the day before; while the
other, with a population of 6,000, had 19 new cases reported that
morning. It is the melancholy fate of those old country towns of
the Mohammedan period, originally well built, with brick houses and
paved streets, and in some cases with fine sarais or forts, to have fallen
into decay of trade and dilapidation of buildings, the houses often
“pakka without, but kaccha within,” as explained to me of an old
two-storied brick house at a village near Benares, in which the rats
had been found dead, and, two or three weeks after, the whole of the
inmates, to the number of 18, had died.

MEANS OF AVOIDING PLAGUE—EVACUATION.

According to everyone’s belief and experience in India, there is only
one thing to be done when plague appears in a place, or the rats begin
to fall, namely, to clear out, or, at all events, to avoid spending the
night there. Hence the strange spectacle every evening about sunset,
in the city of Bijapur, of the whole population, save the inmates of
half a dozen bungalows, to the number of some 20,000, quitting the
bazaars, workshops, and offices, and making their way outside the
walls to a large camp on the downs around the railway station. This
phenomenon is the more suggestive at Bijapur, as the city was de-
serted once before, two hundred years ago, and most probably for the
same reason as now, namely, plague, and continued to be in great part
deserted until it was made the administrative headquarters of the
district about thirty years ago. Also in the country round Bijapur
the people have learned the lesson of evacuation very thoroughly. I
went through an old fortified village of 3,000 people 5 miles to the
west of it, without finding a living creature; the streets were de-
serted, and the doors of all the houses padlocked, the whole of the
ae PLAGUE IN INDIA.

inhabitants being in camp near their fields about a quarter of a mile
away. They had taken alarm from the number of dead rats found,
and the deaths of 36 persons in October, November, and December,
and from the recollection of their first plague epidemic two years
before, when 171 died in the village. At Bijapur City I was told by
a high native official that, if the infection became active another year,
the temporary camp round the railway station would become a_per-
manent residential suburb, so that the area within the walls would be
deserted for the second time in its history. This evacuation is at the
people’s own initiative and at their own expense, which many of them
can il afford. The same thing was going on at Belgaum, where
several thousands went out to camp in the evening and returned to
their work in the bazaars and offices in the morning.

At Dharwar a small beginning had been made toward permanent
evacuation. The government had given a piece of vacant ground to
the municipality, which had sold it by auction in lots at a very low
price, and a new street of some forty houses, called Gibb street, after
the collector, had been run up. At Poona 7,000 or more were in camp
along the sides of suburban roads, or on the various maidans of the
city. At Bombay there were three large health camps along the sea-
ward side of the island as far north as Mahim. In a group of vil-
lages of the Baroda State near Naosari, the cultivators had built
lofty and commodious huts near their wells and fields, to which they
had removed their bedsteads, chests, and other furniture, and in
which they and their children and their bullocks were not unhappy.
The weather after the rains is so fine throughout the Bombay Presi-
dency that there is no hardship whatever in camping out.

It is otherwise in the earher part of the plague season of the north-
west, of which I shall give a single instance from the Punjab. I
went one day with the medical officer on plague duty to a group of
villages 12 or 14 miles from Jullundur. At one of these, a small
village of some 200 people, there had been many deaths from plague
two years before, and on the day of our visit there were more per-
sons lying sick or recovering in their houses than I had seen any-
where in so small a space except in the hospital at Bombay. After
we had gone round the village, a palaver was held with about a dozen
of the men and youths, who stood in a semicircle near the village
well, the women drawing the water all the while. Their spokesman
was a sturdy little Jat who knew his mind, spoke to the point, and
bore himself with the aplomb of a man of affairs. They had been
asked in advance to consider whether they would not submit to inocu-
lation, and had decided so peremptorily in the negative that the
matter was not so much as mentioned again. The only question
discussed was evacuation. The spokesman pointed out various prac-
tical difficulties in the way of a general camping out, to which Cap-

tain Bradley replied, and at length it came to this, that the whole
village might remove to a camp on a certain piece of waste ground
within sight of where we stood if some help were Yorthcoming for
the poorer villagers; it was all a question of expense, and as T was
again mistaken for the commissioner, I was looked at in a signifi-
cant way as we took our leave. But to show how many are the
difficulties in the Punjab, next day a storm of wind and rain broke
which lasted thirty-six hours and was followed by two or three
weeks of intense cold. Camping out was of course impossible, and
the effects of the cold snap were seen in the abrupt rise of the plague
figures about a fortnight after from all parts of the Punjab and the
United Provinces.

SCIENTIFIC THEORY OF EVACUATION.

Evacuation of plague-infected houses or village sites had been
adopted by the people themselves, without any scientific advice, be-
fore the present plague; for example, by the hillmen in IKumaun,
and by the Marwaris, who, as White reported in 1836, “ instantly
quitted a house on seeing a dead rat.” The rats themselves, although
in India they are the symbols of sagacity, are usually surprised by
‘the underground venom, and are often seen trying to escape in a
state of delirium. <A scientific explanation of the common practice
may be found, first, by including plague fully and frankly among the
coil poisons, as I did in my History of Epidemics in Britain, fourteen
vears ago, and, secondly, by applying to it the laws of soil infection
which have been worked out by Pettenkofer and his school. An
infection of the soil makes itself felt most inside dwelling houses, and
most of all overnight, because there is a natural movement of the
ground air toward the walled space. This was shown by the fact
that an escape of gas from a main in the street would travel horizon-
tally through the pores of the greund toward the house opposite, and
be sucked up into it, sometimes to the danger of the inmates. Von
Fodor observed the stratum of air next the floor of an unoccupied
cellar at Budapest day and night for a whole year, and found thai
it always contained more carbonic acid than the ground air outside,
having attracted it from the soil around. In disused cellars, vaults,
or covered wells, the accumulation of carbonic acid is sometimes so
great as to asphyxiate those who enter them first. One reason for the
eround air streaming to and rising through the basement or floor of a
house is that the ground beneath is drier and more permeable, afford-
ing a free upward passage unless there be a concrete foundation or
a2 masonry plinth or stone paving. Another reason is that the air
inside a house is warmer and lighter, so that it yields to the pressure
of colder and heavier air outside and is thrown into an ascending
304 ; PLAGUE IN INDIA.

current. The penetration of the house by ground air is a peculiar
risk in India for several reasons. Where the walls are of mud, as
they are in the great majority of plague villages, and have no ma-
sonry plinth to rest upon, their porous substance is really a part of
the soil, so that the inmates have the ground air not only rising from
the floor, but carried up in the walls as if in a ventilating shaft. A
dwelling house warmed all day by the sun and by the fire kept up
for cooking becomes like an exhausted receiver for the ground air to
rise into. If one visits the old chawls at Bombay, in which there has
been so much plague, you find the narrow, dark rooms on the ground
floor to be heated like an oven even at 8 in the morning.

The intuitive perceptions of the people correspond with the scien-
tific theory of a soil poison. They know that the chief risk of taking
plague is from spending the night in an infected place, and gener-
ally that they incur the greatest risk when confined most to the dwell-
ing houses by cold, domestic duties, or other cause. One very im-
portant thing I must pass over for want of time, namely, the inju-
rious effect of a high level of the ground water and of its seasonal
fluctuations in a filth-sodden soil. In the new chawls at Bombay,
built by the improvement trust, nothing seemed to me to promise
more for the future health than the solid masonry of the foundations,
floors, and passages. The advantages of concrete foundations have
been proved often in similar circumstances, although in Hongkong
they have been only a palliative in plague.

PROBABLE FUTURE OF PLAGUE IN INDIA.

T come lastly to the question, Is there anything to be learned as to
its probable duration from historical precedents and from its own
course during nine years? One was sometimes asked whether the
natural time for plague in India to last was not seven or eight years.
The origin of the idea is what is recorded of two former plagues in
India

one in the reign of the Emperor Jehangir, 1616, of which it is
sald that “it continued to devastate the country for eight years,” the
other in the reign of Aurungzeb, 1688, which “ lasted seven or eight
vears.” Each of these epidemics of bubonic plague is authenticated
twice over by good contemporary authorities, along with some inter-
esting particulars which I have no time to quote. The earher of the
two began in the Punjab at Lahore and “destroyed many villages
and parganas;” the later, seventy years after, was felt most in Oc-
tober and November, 1688, in the city of Bijapur, which Aurungzeb
had just captured and in which his army was encamped, including
15,000 cavalry; but it is said to have lasted seven or eight years and
to have extended over the Deccan and as far as Ahmedabad and
PLAGUE IN INDIA. 335

Surat. The next outbreak in India fell to be described by three
British writers. It happened in Cutch and Kathiawar from 1815
to 1821, in peculiar circumstances of aggravation within walled
towns, arising out of famine and the mode of collecting the tribute
from the recalcitrant petty chieftains of those territories by the
army of the Gaekwar, and it came to an end almost coincidently
with the new order of things in 1821. The only other epidemic be-
fore the present was also a limited one, in Marwar, especially in the
town of Pali, which lasted from 1836 to 1839, and may have been a
revival of plague which is said to have been indigenous in Marwar
“from a remote period.”

Turning from those Indian precedents to the much more continu-
ous and extensive plagues of Europe, we find an uninterrupted his-
tory in one country or another and in one city or another for more
than three hundred years—from the year 1347 to the latter half of
the seventeenth century, when the infection disappeared almost
simultaneously from all the countries of western Europe. The chief
difference between the European plague period and the one which is
now running its course in India is that the former did not involve
the villages, but only the towns, except in its first great wave, from
1347 to 1350, which swamped country and town alike with an almost
unheard-of mortality, and excepting, perhaps, two or three general
but minor revivals at intervals in the latter half of the fourteenth
century; for the rest, it continued an infection of the towns, and in
these it commonly broke out at long intervals—twenty or forty
years—excepting in such capitals as London, where it was seldom
dormant for a series of years until it was about to cease altogether.

It is not surprising that plague in India should be chiefly an affair
of the villages, because that has been also the experience with chol-
era. So much was that a village infection that Anglo-Indian writers
who were at home when cholera reached this country in 1831 prophe-
sied that it would fall most upon the enormously congested rural
population of Ireland. But it spared the Irish villages and ham-
lets almost absolutely, although it attacked the Irish cities severely.
European precedents being thus inapplicable to India as to villages,
we are thrown back upon the lessons that may be learned from the
history of plague in India itself during the last nine years. It is
only from the Bombay Presidency that we have data minute enough
to be of much use, from which it appears that the huge totals of
plague deaths year after year are not so hopeless as they look. When
they are analyzed—and it is no small labor to analyze them—it is
found that the aggregate of each year has been made up by items
from somewhat different places. The cities of Bombay, Poona, and
Karachi have been steady, but in the mofussil all the districts have
336 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

not suffered severely in the same year, the talukas within a given dis-
trict have been affected some one year, some another, and the villages
of a given taluka have been affected in a kind of rotation. T have
shown on the screen the tables of nine villages, which on the whole
agree in proving that each village has had one very severe outbreak,
usually the first, that there have been years absolutely clear, and that
the subsequent outbreaks have been much less extensive than the
original one. It is in the very notion or definition of the word * epi-
demic” that there shall be intermissions; the word ‘ endemic”
means a more steady prevalence from year to year—but in that no-
tion also the steadiness is only in the aggregate of a whole country
or province, not in the several counties or parishes of it. It is prob-
able that all the villages of Bombay Presidency by this time have
had their worst experience of plague, and that in each village plague
has visited all the houses in turn, or as many of them as it is ever
likely to visit. The Bombay figures for the season just ended are
encouraging. Whether it be owing to the resolute practice of evacua-
tion on the first signs of plague or because the invasion is subsiding
naturally, the returns since January have been only about one-third
those of the three or four years preceding for the corresponding
weeks. It looks as if the maximum had been reached and passed,
both for each locality and in the aggregate of the whole Presidency,
and that there is to be a pause. Such pauses occur in all epidemic
infections. We account for them by a phrase or formula that the
infection has exhausted all the “ susceptible subjects,” and we explain
the return of the epidemic after an interval of years by the fact that
a new generation has grown up which contains more “ susceptible
subjects.”

What can be proved from the admirably full statistics of the Bom-
bay Presidency may be perceived in a way in the Punjab. Thus, in
Jullundur, in January this year, I learned that the average was being
kept up to that of former years chiefly by returns from a certain
group of villages in the southwest which were having plague in them
for the first time. The province as a whole is to have more plague
deaths this year than it has had hitherto; but it would certainly
have shown a decrease but for the very large items of three districts
in the Delhi division—Gurgaon, Rohtak, and Hissar—which are
having their first severe epidemic. The prognosis for the Punjab
should be that the infection has reached its height and done its worst
for the time in the districts first attacked and that it will soon begin
to show a decline in the aggregate, following in the wake of Bombay
Presidency.

This is the first vear in which the United Provinces and Behar have
returned such large totals as we have been accustomed to for several
PLAGUE IN INDIA. 337

vears in Bombay and the Punjab, and as ene of them has a popula-
tion nearly, twice as great as these two latter together, it is unsafe
to prophesy what heights plague may not reach in them before it
begins to decline. In any case we may reckon with plague domesti-
cated in the soil of tens of thousands of villages, making an endemic
area larger than that of cholera was ever estimated to be, and from
such an endemic area we may expect future outbreaks at intervals
of years, if not from year to year. In England, for thirty or forty
years after the great invasion of plague in 1348, a poet of the time
compared the state of sickness to “the rain that raineth where we
rest should ” to the drip through a leaky roof, a chronic state of dis-
comfort and uneasiness.

The three centuries of plague in European towns came to an end
without any conscious effort to check the infection anywhere, so far
as one knows. The most probable explanation is that the towns had
emerged slowly from their medieval life, which was peculiarly favor-
able to plague, having thrown down their walls and gates and grad-
ually shifted the pressure of population to new sites, which, however,
were often befouled by the accumulated refuse of the old walled city,
and therefore apt to retain the infection many years longer. The
curious statutes of 32 and 35, Henry VIII, en the decay of practically
all the chief towns of England and Wales, bear out that hypothesis,
according to the reading of their preamble adopted by Nicholls and
Froude. At all events medizval mits were outgrown in all the
towns of Europe, and, after a transition period of a century or more,
plague died out by reason of changed conditions.

India at the present day contains more traces of changed sites than
any country in the world, and some of these changes have actually oc-
curred under British rule. Sometimes the changes of site have been
caused by a river deserting its old channel and leaving a city too far
from the traffic, but there are undoubted instances of sites abandoned
owing to chronic sickness. The British cantonments afford instances
in the past and may afford more in the future. Dacca and Berham-
pore were both condemned, the latter in 1833 after an original outlay
of £300,000; they were healthy stations at first and became sickly by
degrees until they were untenable. What has been happening in
India from time immemorial, both to town sites and to village sites
through the pressure of events, may be anticipated by a deliberate
policy in order to hasten the disappearance of plague. In some of the
towns of the Deccan and Gujarat new suburbs are actually springing
up for the richer class to avoid the infection. For the villages it is
not out of the question that some law might be made to prevent rebuild-
ing on the same foundation when the mud walls crumble, as they do
periodically; but of such a law the essential condition would be the
338 PLAGUE IN INDIA.

helping hand of the State to provide new sites. Atone time I held that
a progressive change of the village site to a clean soil, along with the
break-up of a larger village into several hamlets, would be an effectual
if very slow means of getting rid of plague. But after seeing a good
many of those dreadful mud villages I have come to think that it is
their miserable structure that is the real reason why the Indian plains
are cursed with plague, and that there can be no real cure without a
more civilized kind of dwelling and a great revival of the native
building arts as village industries.
THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER.+

By A. DASTRE.

Once again yellow fever claims our attention. While we are cele-
brating the victorious effort of science in driving that dread disease
from its hereditary domains in Habana and Rio Janeiro, it reappears
and desolates New Orleans; it revives in Honduras and threatens
Panama. Once more we must fight to renew the achievements of
the Americans in Cuba and of the Brazilians in Rio. And that is
possible, for we can struggle to-day with hope, with certainty of suc-
cess. For centuries the disease remained unconquerable. Physicians
knew only what everybody sees—the external signs—the symptoms
and fatal results, but they were not familiar with the true nature of
the disease and the manner of its propagation.

In fact, even to-day our knowledge of the nature of the evil is very
elementary; we have few facts concerning the micro-organism of
yellow fever. The only proven point is that it is a blood parasite,
not feeding upon the red corpuscles like the parasite of malaria, but
only upon the fluid part—the “ plasma.” It is believed that it does
not affect the transparency of liquids, that it can penetrate most fil-
ters, and that it remains invisible to the microscope.

But if the deadly agent, the ultramicroscopic germ, which is. the
specific cause of the disease, is not well known, we are at least familiar
with the means of its propagation, the sole agent of its transmission,
and that is sufficient, as we shall see, rationally and effectually to
eliminate contagion.

This definite agent, the only one capable of inoculating a man with
the micro-organism of yellow fever, is a particular species of mos-
quito, the Stegomyia fasciata, known also as Culex calopus and
previously called Culex fasciata. At the time of Linné, in 1758,
only 6 species of mosquitoes were known. In 1902, 250 different
species could be distinguished, and the number has since increased to
nearly 400 described species. The English naturalist, F. V. Theo-
bald, an authority on the subject, recognized 29 genera. To one of

aTranslated from Reyue des Deux Mondes, Paris, September 1, 1905.
339

340 THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER.

these he gave the name Stegomyia (fly which hides), and in this new
genus he established 22 species. It is one of these species, the Ste-
gomyia fasciata, which to the exclusion of all others, transmits the
yellow fever parasite from the sick to the healthy man. This Ste-
gomyia,moreover,is the most cosmopolitan of all species of mosquitoes,
and its wide distribution explains the continuous spread of this terri-
ble malady since the discovery of America.

Before entering into the blood of a man the fever germ must have
passed a period of incubation in the tissues of the mosquite, and vice
versa. This is a fact of prime importance. The sickness of man
implies the sickness of the mosquito, and inversely. The mosquito’s
illness, however, is light, scarcely perceptible, while that of man is
severe. If ever the human race arrives at the point of being freed
from the yellow-fever micro-organism, the Stegomyia fasciata will
be freed at the same time. Thus there is a sort of pathological com-
pact between man and the mosquito, a kind of unhealthy fellowship
of which the existence of this infectious bacillus is the binding force.
We may therefore believe that in order to eradicate this plague—that
is, the parasitic microbe—this fellowship must be dissolved. The
healthy man must be isolated from the infected mosquito and the
healthy mosquito from the infected man. There would be no danger
in the contact of a healthy man with a healthy mosquito. That is the
theoretical idea. The practical sanitary scheme follows this formula:
To drive out the mosquito, to kill it, or to make it well. Only by
accomplishing separately one of these three aims, or all three at the
same time, have the sanitary authorities been successful in making
healthy the island of Cuba, the Brazilian coast, and more recently the
territory of Dakar, in the French West African colony. Suecess has
been attained in purging these regions .of the disease which had
existed there in an endemic state, and in stifling at the start epidemics
threatened by imported infected cases. It is the same line of action
that will have to be followed in every locality at each reappearance
of the disease until humanity is entirely freed from it.

But to avoid the mosquito, or to find shelter from its bite, we must
know its mode of life, its customs, its habits, its peculiarities, or, in a
word, its complete life history. And that is just what we have
learned from numerous researches by medical naturalists, among
whom must be named the members of three commissions organized by
the United States, English, and French Governments and sent to the
infected localities to study on the spot the evil and its remedies.
Mention must also be made of scholars from the Colonial Medical
School of Liverpool and from the Institut Pasteur de Paris, who
have directed these studies and summarized the results. Besides
special memoirs, the perusal of which is incomparable to gain a
knowledge of the subjects, several recent publications of a more gen-
THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER. 341

eral character have offered the scientific public a collective view of
the ideas gained. Among these works special mention should be made
of Dr. Raphael Blanchard’s elaborate volume upon the natural his-
iory of mosquitoes and their relation to medicine, and of the excel-
lent little book of Messrs. Chantemesse and Borel upon the yellow-
fever misquito.

Through these documents, traced to their different sources, I shall
explain, not so much the practical methods employed in the strug-
gle against yellow fever as the scientific theories upon which the
defense is based.

le

The history of yellow-fever epidemics in various epochs shows a
remarkable tendency for the disease to extend its ravages. Origi-
nating in the islands and on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, it re-
mained for a long time bound to its birthplace. At Vera Cruz the
Spanish conquerors waged war against it from their first attempts
to conquer Mexico at the beginning of the sixteenth century. It was
as formidable an enemy to them as the Aztecs. Historians of the
conquest record that the band under Diego de Nunes, numbering 780
men when in 1509 it had just taken possession of the lowlands of
Vera Cruz, lost 400 men in a short period, and fifteen months later
their number was reduced to 60 men. This first disaster was signifi-
cant. It announced to invaders the frightful consumption of lives of
Europeans which this minotaur of the Tropics, known as the yellow
typhus, black vomit, or yellow fever, was to make during four cen-
turies.

All along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, at the mouths and on
the banks of rivers, the disease lived in an endemic state, showing at
long intervals periods of epidemic outbreak more or less violent.
From this permanent center, called the * Mexican source,” there ex-
tended numerous epidemic radiations. Several, mounting toward the
north, attacked the Bermuda Islands and the Atlantic coast of the
United States; others, summering in the south, infected the Guianas
and Brazil; then encircling the South American Continent, set upon
the Pacific ports. Sugar-laden vessels from Cuba carried the con-
~ tagion to the maritime cities of Europe. In the eighteenth century
slave ships returning from the Antilles infected the western coast of
Africa.

Most of these epidemics, emanating from their original Mexican
center, were extinguished on the spot only after disastrous ravages.
But at other times the yellow fever, encountering in the new coun-
tries conditions favorable for its development, established itself per-
manently in an endemic state. This is what happened in Brazil and
on the coast of Africa.
342 THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER.

Thus were established two secondary sources which became in
their turn two new centers of radiation—the Brazilian source and
the African source. This African source, which dates, as I have
said, from the middle of the eighteenth century, is located in the
Gulf of Guinea between the mouths of the Niger and the Kongo. It
is particularly in the region of Sierra Leone that the permanent en-
demic character of the infection is clearly manifest; from here
have radiated most of the epidemics which have ravaged Africa.

The Brazilian source is of more recent date; it was established in
the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1849 a single ship from
New Orleans, the Brasil, brought yellow fever to Bahia. From that
city another vessel, the Vavarre, carried it to Rio Janeiro, where it
found all the conditions necessary for its naturalization—a low,
marshy ground, river deposits, an intense heat, and an excessive
humidity. So the disease took permanent root as an endemic; it
became a national disease. Finally it branched out from this new
center toward the interior countries, following, as usual, the courses
of rivers. Thus was produced the epidemic which in 1870, during
the war waged by Brazil against Paraguay, broke out in Assumption,
on the Parana, 1.200 kilometers from the coast, and with 30,000
victims spread as far as Buenos Ayres.

Europe in its turn has been the object of many repeated attacks by
this terrible plague. The southern countries below the forty-third
degree of latitude have especially suffered. Spain was attacked for
the first time at Cadiz in 1700. The same port was infected from 1730
io 1734, then in 1780, again from 1800 to 1804, and from 1810 to
1812. The epidemic of 1800 to 1804 instead of being confined to re-
gions along the coast climbed the course of the Guadalquivir and
gained the interior country; it spread to Andalusia and fell upon
Catalonia, with a total of 80,000 victims. In 1812 Barcelona was in-
fected by the ship Grand Ture, hailing from Habana, and 20,000 per-
sons perished. Another epidemic broke out in Pasages in 1828.
From this date there is nothing to mention except two relatively mild
incursions of the plague—one in Barcelona in 1870, the second in
Madrid in 1878 upon the return of a Cuban regiment. Portugal was
seriously attacked at Lisbon in 1723, and lightly im 1750 and 1751.
In 1856 Oporto was the seat of an important epidemic which, brought
by two ships from Brazil, killed 7,000 persons. Italy, since it has
little maritime relation with the centers of contamination, has re-
wained almost entirely free from the plague. Nevertheless in 1804,
et the time of the Spanish epidemic, contagion spreading from Bar-
celona to Livorno caused the death of 1,500 persons. In 1883 a
patient arrived at Torre Annunziata and became the center of a slight
spread of yellow fever.

~
THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER. 343

So much for the hot countries of Europe. In the more temperate
regions of France and England north of the forty-third parallel
there have frequently been yellow-fever cases imported by ships. but
never a real epidemic. .

In France the ship quarantines of Marseille and of Brest received
patients afflicted with yellow fever in 1802, 1804, 1807, 1821, 1836,
1839, and, later, nearly every year from 1891 to 1900. In each case
the workmen employed in unloading the vessels were infected, but
there was no contagion ashore.

The incidents at Marseille in 1821 and at Saint-Nazaire in 1861
are especially interesting; Messrs. Chantemesse and Borel have shown
how instructive they are. While Spain was violently infected during
the summer of 1821, a brig, the Vicolino, left the port of Malaga
bound for Marseille. Upon the day of its departure, August 26, a
yellow-fever patient died on board. During the trip a second case
broke out, and on September 7, upon the ship’s arrival in Marseille,
the patient was sent to the hospital at Pomegue and the vessel held
in the quarantine basin. Other vessels to the number of 40, hailing
from such countries as Tunis, Cyprus, and Alexandria, where yellow
fever had never existed, were moored along the quays of the basin
and kept strictly apart without the least contact with each other.
Nevertheless cases of yellow fever broke out around the brig, even in
the quarantine basin. From September 7 to October 2, 22 persons
were infected. These were some sailors on the neighboring ships,
some health officers stationed on board for their surveillance, and a
laborer working on a pontcon anchored a short distance away.

It was a matter of surprise that the disease so contagious on ship-
board and in its immediate vicinity was not contagious from the pa-
tients transferred to the hospital, nor, asin the case of the workman,
in their houses in the city. No case of contagion in fact originated
either in the hospital or in the city. It is not, then, the sick man
himself nor his clothing, nor his linen, that are the vehicles of the
disease, nor even the shrouds of the deceased ones, but the vehicles
are the mosquitoes, the Stegomyzia, household insects, which of their
own accord wander no more than a few hundred vards from their
birthplace. In the present instance the breeding place of the infec-
tious mosquitoes, their home, was the obscure corners of the ship
Nicolino.

The epidemic of Saint-Nazaire in 1861 furnishes an analogous
example. The ship Anne-Marie sailed from Habana June 12 and
arrived at Saint-Nazaire July 25. Nine sailors were attacked with
vellow fever during the voyage, but they had recovered. The ship’s
sanitary condition being good it was admitted to port. They opened
the hold, the haunt of the insects, a veritable box of Pandora. ‘They
344 THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER.

unloaded the cargo and proceeded to make repairs. Presently some
cases of yellow fever developed among the workmen, the mechanics,
the people dwelling in the vicinity of the infected ship. From July
25 to August 16, 21 individuals were attacked. The epidemic of
which the Anne-Marie was the center spread to the neighboring
vessels, and 10 new cases broke out more or less tardily after they
had left port.

England is in the same condition as France in respect to yellow
fever. The ports of Falmouth, Southampton, and London have had
several outbreaks of the disease. Epidemics may originate on a con-
taminated ship, carrying in its hold some Stegomyia. These in-
sects, either infected when the ship sailed or susceptible of infection
from yellow-fever patients during the voyage, transmit the disease to
whoever approaches them. Some mosquitoes pass to ships near by
and make them new centers of the disease. That is the story of the
epidemic of Saint-Nazaire in 1861. It is likewise the history of the
epidemic that occurred four years later at Swansea, England, where
the ship /Zecla, arriving from Cuba, contaminated a score of persons
coming aboard and spread the fever to another vessel anchored in
its vicinity.

This is not the place to give a story in detail of all epidemics. It
is enough to say that all the particular circumstances are clearly
explained by the supposition that the mosquito is the sole agent of
propagation of the infectious germ and by the knowledge of its mode
of life, its habits, and its dwelling places.

iL

What has been said of the geographical distribution of yellow
Tever has shown the tendency of the disease to spread continuously
on land. It is seen that its progress has been steady since the begin-
ning of the sixteenth century. Can we tell where its onward march
will stop unless scientific hygiene intervenes to cut it short? Should
we suppose that 1t will continue indefinitely and that the pest with-
out cessation will overrun new regions as havigation is developed
and as commercial relations are multiplied with contaminated coun-
tries? Finally, what are the countries menaced in the more or less
near future ? :

It is easy to answer these questions. It is enough to translate the
statement into a language conforming to the doctrine of propagation
of the disease by the mosquito. The yellow fever will be implanted
wherever the Stegomyia lives and multiples, or better, wherever it
is capable of living and multiplying. By a happy chance for Euro-
pean countries it is found that this species of mosquito can live only
in conditions of high temperature, exactly adapted to the accomplish-
THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER. 345

ment of its vital functions. The perfect insect can subsist only at
a temperature between 60 and 100° F.; below 60° it is paralyzed,
it moves with difficulty. It bites with

energy only above 75°. It mates between 68 and 85°, but there is fer-
tilization only when the temperature is above 75°. It lays its eggs

in the water where it lives, in stagnant water of flower vases, gutters,
bottles, tubs, and sinks, but only when the temperature is from 80
to 85°.

The conditions of development of the larvee are not less rigorously
precise. The development of the egg and the hatching of the larva
demand a temperature between 68 and 85°—the best is at 82°. All
lowering under that figure shows itself by a greater or less retarda-
tion in their development. The larva is aquatic. Its respiration of
air obliges it to fix itself at the surface of the water or to rise there
to seek the air periodically. It develops normally into a_ perfect
insect in a period of nine days, provided the temperature at night
does not go below 80°; otherwise the formation of the winged insect,
capable of mating and of reproducing itself, is prolonged to forty or
even sixty days.

To sum up, then, it appears that the yellow-fever mosquito obtains
its full and regular vital development only at an average tempera-
ture of 82°, and that any lowering of the temperature night or day
renders less efficient some one of its physiological functions. This
data is consequently of the first importance. The strict dependence
of the mosquito on temperature conditions is an essential fact in the
interpretation of the history of yellow fever; it is the key to all its
mysteries. The Stegomyia needs plenty of heat and of heat steadily
mnaintained. As soon as the temperature falls, the insect’s life be-
comes endangered, and at 60° it is benumbed and soon dies. This
sensitive insect does everything in its power to protect itself from the
increasing chilliness of the air, and its mode of living offers the means
for doing so. It is practically a fellow-boarder with man, under the
same roof. It is a domestic animal, like the house fly. Whenever it
is cold, it takes refuge in kitchens, bathrooms, heated bedrooms, in
bakeries, or in other warm places. On ships it finds a last resort
close to the engine room, near the heat pipes or smoke pipes. If the
temperature falls below 60°, it becomes torpid and benumbed like a
marmot.

These conditions in their rigorous precision are, so far as known,
peculiar to the Stegomyia among all mosquitoes, and explains
many features in the history of yellow fever. I shall mention
but one. This relates to the peculiar immunity enjoyed by the
inhabitants of Petropolis, in Brazil. Petropolis may be called
the sanitarium of Rio Janeiro. It is a country resort 30 miles

sm 1905——26
346 THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER.

from the capital, at an altitude of 2,800 feet. It is the resi-
dence of the well-to-do population—the diplomatic corps, the
principal merchants, financiers, and government officials. Before
nightfall all these take the tram for the elevated region, where
they find bracing air and healthful security. Petropolis, in fact, is
free from yellow fever at the very time when Rio is scourged with it,
and yet between these two places there is a lively traffic and constant
relations. Even more, some yellow-fever patients are taken there
for treatment throughout their illness, yet the disease is not communi-
cated to anyone. The reason is that the Stegomyia can not live m
that climate, and such as come in the railway trains each day perish
immediately, for the evenings are cool and during the night the tem-
perature often falls below 60°. There is sometimes another explana-
tion given for the immunity from fever enjoyed in this Brazilian
country resort. It is attributed to the altitude of the region above
sea level. This is a mistake. Yellow fever and its mosquito are
found even at greater heights than Petropolis. It is enough to men-
tion the epidemics at Morne Rouge, in Martinique (920 feet eleva-
tion) ; at Camp Jacob, in Guadeloupe (1,800 feet) ; at Newcastle, in
Jamaica (4,000 feet). The fact is that thermometric conditions are
paramount.

It is found that the extreme heat and humidity best adapted to
the welfare of the vellow-fever mosquito are most common along the
coasts of tropical countries. The lands best suited to the swarming of
this insect and to the spread of the plague form a belt around the
earth north and south of the equator. If lines be drawn in the north-
ern and southern hemispheres corresponding to the forty-third par-
allel of latitude, the circles would mark the upper and lower limits
of the home of the Stegomyia and, accordingly, of the yellow fever.
The region comprised in this vast zone form what MM. Chantamesse
and Borel call the “ infectible territories,’ and the more temperate
countries on either side of this zone, denied to the mosquito, are the
“uninfectible territories.” The Stegomyia fasciata considered as a
species can not become acclimated beyond this equatorial zone, for
it does not find that almost invariable temperature of 82° which is
indispensable for the proper exercise of its vital functions, and
especially of reproduction.

The infectible zone represents the actual or virtual habitat of the
infectious mosquito. It is the region of epidemics and is also the
region of possible endemic or permanent centers of infection. At
present the Stegomyia, which is a genus of mosquito very cosmopoli-
ian in its habit, lives in widespread districts throughout the infecti-
ble zone. Theobald found it in India, the Malay archipelago, in
Japan, in Africa, in America, and in all warm countries where he
hunted for it. The contagion is capable, if not well guarded, of
THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER. 347

spreading over a very large part of the warmer portion of the inhab-
ited globe. Thus, if an infected vessel, having on board men or
merely mosquitoes contaminated with the disease, makes a landing in
the infectible zone, it threatens a whole country with an epidemic;
men inoculate the Stegomyia, and new generations of Stegomyia
carry the disease to other men; the plague progresses, the contagion
spreads in scope and in duration; the port, the city, the country is
ravaged. This is what happened in Spain at the time of the epi-
demic at Cadiz and at Barcelona in 1804 and 1812.

The case is totally different in the uninfectible territories situated
beyond the habitat of this mosquito. The infected vessel occasions
only a local epidemic, which exhausts itself on the spot. The in-
fectious insects, on account of their sedentary habits, never wander
far from the ship that houses them; they bite only those imprudent
enough to disturb them. At the farthest they move only to the
neighboring vessels. Since the climate is unfavorable for their
reproduction, their ravages last only during their ephemeral life.
Hence these minor epidemics are limited to a single ship or to an
anchorage basin and vanish of their own accord. This was the case
with the yellow-fever invasion observed at Marseille, at St. Nazaire,
at Swansea, and in general at all French and English ports. The
reason for this is understood. It is because all of England and
nearly all of continental France are beyond the forty-third parallel,
and consequently the disease does not flourish there.

IU.

This line of demarcation between the countries that are susceptible
of infection and those which are not, a line fixed by the forty-third
parallel, has much importance in the campaign against the yellow
fever. On one side of the boundary the peril is great, and sanitary
measures should be rigorous. On the other side there is, so to speak,
no danger at all, and the subject of sanitation is very much simpli-
fied. On either side of this entomological and pathological frontier
the health regulations may, and should, differ. They should be made
in accordance with scientific facts, which enlighten both theory and
practice. How the obscurities disappear! How the paradoxes van-
ish that troubled investigators just a few years ago! The physicians
in the Marseille quarantine during the epidemic of 1821 understood
nothing of the nature of that disease which was so frightfully con-
tagious on shipboard and which ceased to be so the moment patients
were transferred to the city hospital. All is clear now that scholars
on the United States commission of 1900¢ have taught us that there

Reed in present Smithsonian Report for 1905,

is no contagion from the infected persons, nor from their clothing,
nor even from their faeces, but only by infected mosquitoes, which, in
the case mentioned, were confined on a vessel. What a paradox it
seemed to epidemiologists of that time that of two cities—Barcelona
and Marseille—one clean and new, the other insanitary and old, it was
the first which was visited by the yellow fever, while the second
remained untouched. There is no longer a paradox for those who
know that one city is on the northern and the other on the southern
side of the frontier that limits the habitat of the contaminating

mosquito.

The forty-third parallel strikes the continent of Kurope at Ferrol,
in Spain, follows the Pyrennes districts, crosses the Hyeres Islands
below Marseille to the heights of Leghorn in Italy; it leaves below
it nearly all of Spain, the southern half of Italy, and of the French
possessions part of the Hyéres Islands and of Corsica. Care should
be taken in directing to any one of these islands any French colonial
companies returning from yellow-fever countries.

The infectible countries, possible prey for the pestilence, comprise,
as may be seen, a considerable enough portion of Europe, the whole
of Africa, a large part of Asia, of Australia, and the oceanic islands.
Here is an immense empire that must be watched. It will become
more and more formidable, as direct relations are multiplied with
the different endemic centers of Brazil, the Antilles, and the Gulf of
Guinea. The cutting of the Isthmus of Panama, by opening to the
plague Polynesia and the Asiatic world, might create a menacing
danger. .

The way to prevent this extension is to attack the agent of its
propagation, the Stegomyia, both on land and sea; on land by trying
to purge the endemic centers where the insect becomes infectious,
and on sea by attempting to destroy the mosquito itself in the ships
where it finds refuge.

Three signal victories have been gained over yellow fever during
these later years—in Cuba, in Brazil, and in Dakar, in West Africa.
The first is the most memorable of these events. It is the purification
of the endemic center at Habana. This occurred in 1901, during the
United States occupation. The daily press in countless articles has
spread the details. We know that Brig. Gen. Leonard Wood, gov-
ernor of Habana, decreed one fine day that the plague should be
wiped out and the mosquitoes destroyed throughout the entire city of
Habana and its suburbs, and we know that it was done. Praise has
rightly been given to the spirit of decision, of activity, of energy,
and even Draconian rigor which attended the execution of this work.
Tt remains to point out its wisdom, its exact conformity to scientific

theories,
THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER. 349

The theory was that the mosquito is the sole disseminator of the
disease. This is precisely what the United States commission, ap-
pointed the year before, had just proven. It had shown that all the
other supposed causes of contagion were imaginary; that a man
could sleep in the bed of a sick patient or of one deceased, could come
in contact with his feces, put on his clothes, use his linen, confine
himself in badly ventilated rooms at a humid temperature of 100°,
and leave unscathed by the test if he escaped the mosquito bite. The
extermination of the plague, then, leads to the extermination of the
mosquito. But this pretension of banishing such a wily enemy seems
foolish at first sight. You can hardly rid a room of one little insect
that buzzes around, and yet they say you would rid a swampy coun-
try of legions of mosquitoes that abound there.

The yellow fever Stegomyia does not breed in swamps. It has not
the habits of the Anophele of the marsh, the malaria mosquito. It
does not live like that one, in the open country, but dwells in houses.
Tt is a domestic insect. It stays at home, is wary, and is sensitive to
the weather. Like many other mosquitoes, it never goes more than
500 or GOO yards away from its breeding place and journeys only
when its home—a vessel or a carriage—journeys. There is no need
to fear that the insect may be carried far by the wind, for it dreads
the wind. It does not trust itself outdoors when there is the light-
est breeze. The problem is thus simplified. It is no longer a ques-
tion of protecting immense areas. It is enough to protect the house
and its immediate environs—the city and a limited surrounding zone.
Still it would be useless to capture the insect on the wing or at rest.
It is permitted to complete its short life, but is not allowed to have
offspring. The female is prevented from laying its eggs. This is
wvecomplished by draining stagnant water left in so many gardens
and household utensils where the mosquito seeks a breeding place.
fence the efficacy of the measures which forbade the people of Ha-
bana from keeping water in any other way than in covered recep-
tacles or with a coat of oil or petroleum on top.

The success of the measures taken by the American physicians,
Gorgas, Finlay, and Guiteras, in Habana was complete. Yellow
fever has disappeared from there. On April 4, 1904, the President
of the Republic of Cuba, in his message to the Congress, spoke thus:

There has not been in Cuba since 1901 a single case of yellow fever not im-
ported. The country should know of this excellent sanitary condition, which is
due to the perfection of prophylactic measures and the vigilance of the health
authorities.

Events happened in the same way in Brazil. Dr. Oswaldo Cruz, in
charge of the organization of the campaign against yellow fever,
with equal success repeated at Rio de Janeiro what had been done in
350 THE FIGHT AGAINST YELLOW FEVER.

Habana. The enforcement of the measures began April 20, 1903.
The mortality which before had averaged 150 deaths a month fell to
Sin the month of April and to 4 in June. In January, 1904, there
were recorded only 3 deaths.

France decided to follow these encouraging examples. The gov-
ernor-general of French Western Africa, M. Roume, adopted an ad-
ministration analogous to that of Habana and Rio de Janeiro, and he
knew how to profit by these examples. The result was not long de-
layed. On May 29, 1905, an imported yellow-fever patient died in
Dakar. Thanks to the precautions taken, this death has not been
followed by a single other one. The threatened epidemic was
stopped at its first stride and that colony saved from a new disaster
such as it had suffered twice in less than thirty years.
LUMINOSITY IN PLANTS.¢
By Prof. Dr. Hans Mo.iscH.

Sixty-two years ago, at the twenty-first meeting of German
scientists and physicians at Gratz, over which no less a personage
than the famous chemist, J. von Liebig, presided, an Austrian investi-
gator, J. T. Heller, gave an address upon the luminosity of decaying
wood, and advanced the idea that the production of light did not
come from the decaying wood itself, but from a fungus which pene-
trated the wood. Not long after this the same investigator carried
out a thorough examination of light coming from decaying animals
and plants, and discovered that the luminosity in the flesh of dead
marine animals and various decaying plant substances was not a
purely chemical but a biological process, uniformly produced by a
certain plant, a fungus. That is to say, it is not the flesh of a fish
or the wood that is luminous, but a fungus living upon these and
penetrating them in proportion to their decay. It may be noted
that priority for this discovery has been accorded, though unjustly,
to the gifted physiologist, E. Pfiiiger, because Heller’s investiga-
tions dropped entirely out of sight, and were only recently discovered
by me. The priority unquestionably belongs to Heller.

By understanding that the problem is a biological one, an im-
portant basis has been gained for further investigations. As, fur-
thermore, R. Koch has enriched scientific knowledge by his bacterio-
logical technique and the method of pure cultures of bacteria, the cul-
tivation of various light-producing bacteria and recently also of lumi-
nous fungi has been successfully undertaken. We are now in condition
to approach the subject of distinguishing between various species, of
investigating the conditions for luminosity, the nature of the light,
and the problem of light development. If we exclude light develop-
ment in the Peridinew, which are sometimes referred to the animal
and sometimes to the vegetable kingdom and which play an im-

portant part in the striking spectacle of marine phosphorescence; and
if we ignore the so-called glimmer of flowers, first observed by the
daughter of Linneus, which is attributable to an entirely different
cause, probably a purely physical one, and most likely to the appear-
ance of St. Elmo’s fire, all hght-producing plants may be said to
belong to the Fungi; that is, to the Bacteria and the mycelial Fungi.

In order to avoid misunderstanding it may be said that in speak-
ing of hght-producing plants I refer invariably to those plants which
of themselves produce the light, their own and not reflected Hght, to
which latter phenomenon are to be referred the wonderful iridescence
of many sea alge, the remarkable emerald green gleam of the lumi-
nous moss Schistostega osmundacea, and the reflection, like liquid
gold, of the Flagellate, Chromophyton rosanofii. There are in
round numbers thirty different kinds of bacteria and about half as
many other fungi which have the power of luminosity. If we com-
pare this to the combined number of existing plant species they
doubtless appear as a very small proportion. Nevertheless we are
frequently surrounded with luminous objects in nature and even in
the household, because certain ones of these light-producing fungi are
among the most common of all plants. Of these I will give a couple
of examples.

Until recently luminosity in butchers’ meat was considered to be
a spectacle of rare occurrence, a curiosity the cause of which was un-
known and the conditions producing it infrequent. When I under-
took an investigation of the matter IT lacked proper material; and
although I communicated with various people and institutions where
luminous meat would be most likely to be found, not a single specimen
was supplied to me for fully two years. I was about ready to aban-
don the undertaking when the idea came to me to examine meat
supphed to me for household use, and to my astonishment it appeared
that such meat, kept for from one to three days ina cool place, began in
many instances to spontaneously produce light. In following up the
matter I found that the luminosity much more frequently occurred
if ordinary butchers’ meat was so immersed in a 3 per cent solution of
salt that about one-half of it remained out of the liquid. Experi-
ments with meat carried on for three months afforded not less than
87 per cent of cases of luminosity ; thus, experiments with beef afforded
89 per cent, experiments with horseflesh 65 per cent. By means of pure
cultures it was demonstrated that the cause of the luminosity was
invariably the same intensely luminous bacterium, namely, Bacterium
phosphoreum (Cohn) Molisch. As Thave carried on similar researches
for a number of years, not only in the city of Prague but in other
cities as well and with essentially the same results, it can be stated
that the spontaneous luminosity of meat is in fact a quite common
occurrence.
LUMINOSITY IN PLANTS. 353

The cause of this hght development, Bacterium phosphoreum, is
one of the most widely distributed of the bacteria. It is found on
meat in refrigerators, in slaughterhouses, in butcher shops; in fact,
it finds an entrance into our kitchens where meat is usually prepared.
For in no other way can we explain the fact that so many specimens
of meat display the power of spontaneous luminosity. I have of late
come upon another form of light production, which, although of com-
mon occurrence, 1s practically unknown. I refer to light from decay-
ing leaves. During walks taken at night in the Tropics, especially
in Java, I frequently found the dead leaves of Bambusa, Nephelium,
Aglaia, and other plants to be luminous in the darkness. On return-
ing to Europe with the experiences gathered in the Tropics, I looked
into the same subject on native ground and found that luminous
dead leaves of the oak and beech are quite common in middle Europe.
The leaves must be in a somewhat moist condition and to some extent
decayed. Such leaves, especially, as display on account of decay a
somewhat yellowish or ashen color or show spots of yellow and
brown give a particularly beautiful light. The luminosity is usually
local, rarely over the entire surface—a white, soft, steady light.
Here also the luminous cause is not the leaf substance, but the living
fungus within it.

According to my own observations, no inconsiderable percentage of
fallen oak and beech leaves are luminous in the summer time; and on
all sides the floor of the forest is illuminated with light, feeble, indeed,
but easily detected. Unfortunately I have not as yet been able to
isolate the fungus which produces this light of decaying foliage.
Still I have employed with advantage the methods of pure cultures
with the fungus, producing hght in wood, and thereby have recog-
nized in Agaricus melleus and Mycelium « the two fungi which
with us most frequently cause this luminosity. At the same time it
has become evident that certain cryptogams generally considered
as luminous fungi, such as Vylaria Hypoxylon, must be stricken out
of the list of the Photomycetes, and to this may also be added 7Z'ra-
metes pint.

In Bacterium phosphoreum (Cohn), Molisch and Mycelium * x”
(necessarily so called at present, as despite years of cultivation it has
not yet fruited), are secured two remarkably valuable experimental
adjuncts for accurately studying light development in a definite way,
because of their relatively powerful intensity of light and the un-
usually long period that they are luminous.

Luminosity and the growth of luminous bacteria are dependent,
among other things, upon certain salts and organic substances. Table
salt plays a prominent part in this respect, seeing that as a rule these
bacteria are marine, and for this reason 3 per cent of table salt is
generally added to the culture medium, The salt does not serve as

?

354 LUMINOSITY IN PLANTS.

food, but rather performs an osmotic function, by rendering the
culture medium more or less isosmotic to the cell contents of the
bacteria. Other salts can in the same way replace table salt, as
potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium
nitrate, potassium iodide, and potassium sulphate. In fact, I have
the impression that potassium nitrate is more active in causing
luminosity than the chlorides, such as sodium and_ potassium
chlorides.

We are indebted to Beijerinck for some exhaustive and valuable
investigations upon the relations existing between nutriment, lumi-
nosity, and growth. ‘The method of his investigations is essentially
the spreading upon thin glass plates of gelatin containing photo-
bacteria and supplied with an excess of nutriment. When it is spread
out as a thin film the bacterial field quickly becomes luminous. As
soon, however, as the excess of nutriment is consumed, the hght
ceases. If now we add to the gelatin a substance the influence of
which on luminosity and growth we desire to test, it dissolves and is
disseminated in a circle in all directions. If this added substance
is a nutritive one for luminosity, we see, Trequently in a few seconds,
the area that was affected growing luminous. By this method
bacterial fields exhibit reactions of astounding delicacy. Certain
materials, preeminently lebulose and glucose, cause the field to grow
luminous in a few seconds. In this respect the photobacteria react
with so minute a quantity of material that Beijerinck saw in these
reactions an analogy to the Bunsen-flame reaction. In one sense
this bacterial reaction 1s superior, in that it continues longer.

The luminous bacteria act in various ways with materials contain-
ing carbon and nitrogen. One class, called by Beijerinck Pepton-
bacteria, finds the necessities for growth and lght development sup-
plied in pepton or some albuminous material; the other class, called
by him Pepton-carbon-bacteria, requires at the same time the pres-
ence of material contaiming pepton to supply the necessary oxygen
and also carbonaceous matter, which is not necessarily free from
nitrogen.

If the nutritive material is well adapted to both growth and a
multiplication of bacteria, it will cause not only luminous fields, but
fields of growth called “ auxanogrammes,” characterized by the in-
numerable colonies of bacteria that develop far more rapidly in
the field where the material has been diffused than outside of it.
Beijerinck calls such nutritive material “ plastic.” Luminous sub-
stances are uniformly plastic though-the reverse of this is not neces-
sarily true. From this the important fact follows that light devel-
opment by the luminous bacteria is not necessarily connected with
either growth or respiration,
LUMINOSITY IN PLANTS. 355

Beijerinck has with great ability made use of the luminous bae-
teria for detecting the most minute quantity of an enzyme.¢

The following example will illustrate this: He takes advantage
of the fact that Photobacterium phosphorescens displays light with
maltose, while Photobacterium Pfliigeri does not. He uses a thor-
oughly cooked mixture of sea water containing 8 per cent of gelatin,
1 per cent of pepton, and one-fourth per cent of potato starch. To
a portion of this he adds an excess of Photobacterium phosphorescens
and to the rest the same of Photobacterium Pfliigeri, and prepares
from these two similar gelatin plates equally illuminated. In both
the starch remains unchanged, seeing that these bacteria are unable
to secrete the necessary enzyme, diastase. If now some diastase prep-
aration (such as maltose, pancreas-diastase, or ptvalin) is added to
these plates, it distributes itself in all directions, transforms the
starch into grape sugar, and upon the field of the Photobacterium
phosphorescens there instantly appear strong, shining flecks, which
later spread over the whole field of growth, while on the field of
Photobacterium Pfligeri nothing of this kind is to be seen. In this
way Photobacterium phosphorescens can be made to demonstrate
through its luminosity the presence of maltose—that is to say, of
a diastase.

For an understanding of the nature of ight development in plants
it is above all necessary to state that the luminosity is absolutely de-
pendent upon free oxygen. The light is conditioned on oxidation.
The finest investigations of the dependence of luminosity upon oxy-
gen are the brilliant experiments of Beijerinck. According to his
researches the luminous bacteria afford the most sensitive tests for
oxygen that we possess. ‘Thus the extremely minute quantity of oxy-
gen which unicellular alge give off in sunlight by their assimilation
of carbonic-acid gas, is sufficient to instantly render these bacteria
luminous. If we introduce these green cells into a glass tube filled
with bouillon containing luminous bacteria, the ight quickly disap-
pears because the bacteria speedily consumes the oxygen contained in
the hquid. If, now, such a tube is kept in a dark room and then the
heht of a match is allowed to fall upon it for a single second the en-
tire mass grows luminous. The green cells give off oxygen, and this
fabulously minute quantity of the free gas is sufficient to cause lumi-
nosity in the bacteria. It is a remarkable example of the fact that
physiological methods not only compete well with the best physical
and chemical methods, but plainly surpass them, and that a vital

function itself can be used as a methodical factor of science of the
highest value.

A demonstration of the importance of oxygen-to luminosity can
be made before a large audience in the following way: A glass tube
closed at one end, having a diameter of about 8 mm. and a length
of 1 to 13 m. is filled to within { to 1 em. of the top with strongly
juminous bouillon (bouillon mixed with Bacterium phosphorium ov
Pseudomonas lucifera). Such a tube at the expiration of a quarter
of an hour loses its light as the bacteria exhaust the oxygen, except
the mere upper surface of the liquid in contact with the air. If, now,
the tube is closed with the thumb and inverted, a bubble of air will
ascend through the bouillon, making its entire course luminous and
appearing in the darkness like a slowly ascending skyrocket. In a
quarter of an hour or less the luminosity again disappears, and the
experiment can be repeated.

Botanists, as a rule, teach that a direct relationship exists in the
fungi between the development of ght and respiration. Thus
Sachs speaks of phosphorescence as the necessary consequence of
respiration, of phosphorescence by means of respiration. But F.
Ludwig has already demonstrated that luminous bacteria can be cul-
tivated, and therefore made to grow and breathe without any lumi-
nosity; and we can therefore easily see how that at increasing tem-
peratures the intensity of respiration may steadily increase, but
the intensity of luminosity to only a limited degree. The relation
existing between light development and oxygen is analogous to
that between color development and oxygen. Most of the color-
producing bacteria show color only in the presence of oxygen, as
can be seen in gelatin cultures into which an infected needle has
been introduced. When the free gas can reach the bacteria, the
color appears, but deeper in the gelatin the bacteria, cut off from
oxygen, develop without color. Color production and hght produc-
tion are therefore oxydation phenomena. * * = *

During recent times quite a number of investigators have been
incidentally or directly engaged in throwing light upon the nature
of luminosity—E. Pfltiger, Radziszewski, Dubois, F. Ludwig, Katz,
Tollhausen, Lehmann, Beijerinck, McKenney, and Nadson. How-
ever, their interpretations differ from each other considerably. The
further our knowledge of the subject is extended the more probable
appears the idea that within the cell is a hypothetical substance,
“ photogen,” which has the power of producing hght in the presence
of free oxygen. This idea receives substantial support from the
fact brought out by Radziszewski that a long lst of organic sub-
stances, such as aldehyde materials, ethereal oils, carbonic-acid,
water, fatty oils, and certain of the alcohols, have the power of
luminosity when brought into alkaline reaction with active oxygen.
LUMINOSITY IN PLANTS. 357

As the light produced by these substances has an external and spec-
troscopic likeness to that produced by living organisms, and as some
of the substances in the list of Radziszewski which are capable of
luminosity exist also in living cells (I mention lecithin, fats, choles-
terine, ethereal oils, and grape sugar) that investigator has come to
the conclusion that light development in living organisms can be
explained as an oxydation of these same substances. Radziszewski
looks upon the problem, therefore, as solved. We have, however, as
vet hardly gotten that far. The question of whether Radziszewski
is in the right could be definitely settled if we could extract from the
living cell a photogen material which would show luminosity outside
of the cell. But up to the present time the attempt has not been
successful. Furthermore, according to Pfeffer, no active light-caus-
ing oxygen exists in the living plant cell, which does not square with
the theory on which Radziszewski’s explanation rests, inasmuch as
his hght-producing substance is luminous only when in contact with
active oxygen. Nevertheless, I look upon the photogen theory as
the most plausible, though we at present have no knowledge as to
the nature of photogen. Possibly it is a material in no sense similar
to the luminous substances previously mentioned; perhaps something
capable of giving hght without active oxygen.

There are certain facts which appear to me to directly support the
idea of a photogen. Thus certain animal organisms give out a non-
cellular luminous secretion, and certain cells together with their
contents are capable of producing light when no longer living. Men-
tion can be made of Pholas, certain of the insects, myriapods, and
many of the worms. <A fact of significance and too little noted is
that certain tissues and cells have the power of producing light in a
lifeless condition. Thus manuscript written with the luminous mate-
rial obtained from Luciola ttalica gives off hght when it is dampened.
The light organs of Lampyris noctiluca lose their luminosity when
thoroughly dried and kept ina vacuum. But,according to Bongardt,
if after a year’s time they are taken out and moistened with a drop of
distilled water the hght reappears. If filter paper is impregnated
with the secretions of certain myriapods, it can, after two months’
time, be made Inminous by moistening. It is impossible in such in-
stances to talk longer about “ living cells” or “ living cell contents,”
for it is impossible to describe as living the luminous material from
an insect that has been dried and kept for a year in a vacuum. In
such instances we are no longer dealing with a vital but with a purely
chemical process; we are dealing with a substance which produces
light in the presence of water and free oxygen.

In the case of luminous plants no such thing as a luminous excre-
tion exists, though such is erroneously stated to be the case, for the
light exists only within the cell. In other words, it has never been
seen outside of the living plant cell, and to that extent luminosity in

plants must be spoken of as a genuine vital luminosity. But in the
same way not long ago alcoholic fermentation was held to be insep-
arably connected with living yeast cells, while to-day, thanks to the
brilliant biochemical discoveries of Buchner, we know that it is due
to a certain material—the ferment zymase—which can of itself,
although a lifeless substance, bring about the fermentation. We can
suppose the same to be true for photogen. Although the isolation of
such a luminous material has not as yet been accomplished, the fail-
ure is probably due to the material being present in such very minute
quantity, to its extreme inStability, and its destruction through the
death of the cell. What photogen really is, and whether the giving
of light represents a process of fermentation—these questions can not
at present be answered. The future investigator must unearth these
facts. To directly or indirectly prove the existence of photogen; to,
if possible, isolate it from the cell, and then render it luminous—such
efforts, in the light of other biochemical facts, appear to me most
tempting and by no means unpromising.

Whoever has observed the swarms of fireflies flying through the
darkness of the night like wandering stars, or the intense light of
pure cultures of bacteria and the higher fungi, must involuntarily
have been impressed by the peculiarity of these “ living” lights.
And therefore it 1s easy to see that at a time when the science of
physics has surprised us with unexpected revelations, appearing at
first like marvels, that we should with redoubled activity turn our
attention to the nature of this hght coming forth from life, and seek
to discover its physical, chemical, and physiological activities.

T wish, first of all, to call attention to a noteworthy difference be-
tween the character of this light in the animals and in the plants. If
we leave out of account the Peridinex and confine ourselves to the
plants alone, we see they are always steadily luminous. The bac-
teria and higher fungi give forth hght for days, weeks, months—in-
deed, under some circumstances, as when supphed with abundant
nourishment, for years, without cessation, day and mght, while the
animals, with few exceptions, shine only a short time, a few seconds
or minutes, and mainly in response to some external irritation; so
that the light gives the impression of a flash or spark. The hght of
the fungi is of a white, green, or blue character, and, contrary to
carher statements, never undulates like the hght of phosphorus; never
is inconstant or glimmering, but is in all cases quiet, steady, and con-
stant, whether viewed with the naked eye or through the microscope.
Asa rule, its intensity appears to be low, and yet there are bacteria so
intensely luminous that they.can be seen on a bright day in the corner
ef a room without the eyes being accustomed to the darkness. <A re-
markable object in this respect is Bacterium phosphoreum (Cohn)
Molisch, the luminous bacteria of butcher’s meat, and, to an even
LUMINOSITY IN PLANTS. 359

greater extent, Pseudomonas lucifera Molisch, a photobacterium
which two years ago I discovered in marine fish, the ight intensity of
which surpasses that of any luminous bacteria heretofore known.

To R. Dubois is due the credit of having first attempted to utilize
bacterial ight in the form of a lamp, and I have renewed Dubois’s
attempt with the two already mentioned intensely luminous bacteria,
and have constructed a bacterial lamp on the following plan: In a
Florence flask, having a capacity of from 1 to 2 liters, is put from
200 to 400 cubic centimeters of salt-peptone-gelatin. It is then
stopped with cotton wool and sterilized. When cool, but before the
gelatin has quite solidified, it is infected with a culture, fresh and
luminous, of Bacterium phosphoreum or Pseudomonas lucifera, a
platinum needle being used. The flask is held horizontally and
slowly rotated, so that the gelatin forms a coating on the entire inner
surface of the flask and then hardens. After being kept for one or
two days in a cool room, the entire inner surface of the flask is covered
with colonies of bacteria, so that it gleams with an exquisitely beau-
tiful bluish-green light, and presents with its soft, steady brillancy
a splendid appearance. I have lately found that the luminous power
of such a lamp can be considerably augmented by applying the
infection to the gelatin in parallel lines about 1 centimeter apart,
running from the bottom to the neck of the flask, and adding to the
gelatin 1 to 2 per cent of peptone and about one-half per cent of
glycerin. Such a lamp will continue luminous in a cool room for
about fourteen days, and when the eye is accustomed to the darkness
will give light enough to see the face of a watch, the scale of a ther-
mometer, or to read coarse print. Such a flask is visible on a dark
night at a distance of 64 paces, and could in an emergency be utilized
as a night lamp. Inasmuch as dead luminous flounders are success-
fully used as bait by fishermen on account of their light, a lamp of
this kind could be made to serve as a valuable lure in catching fish.

My investigations warrant me in stating that in the future it will
probably be possible, by means of exact formulas of nutriment and
by selective breeding, to so increase the intensity of this exceedingly
cheap source of light, so free also from heat rays, that on account of
its cheapness, its long and uninterrupted luminosity, its freedom
from danger, and its lack of heat it can be turned to practical
account in powder magazines, in mines that are not too warm, and
in other places.

In connection with the investigations of F. Ludwig and Forster, I
may state, in regard to the luminous bacteria and mycelial fungi, that
their light spectra are continuous, without dark lines, and, as a rule,
simply luminous spectra

bacteria shows a more decided trend toward the violet end of the

spectrum than that of the higher fungi; and that in regard to the
light of fungi (and this is also true for insects) the green rays domi-
nate the weaker yellow and blue rays. I have actually succeeded in
distinguishing colors through the spectroscope in the intense light of
the previously mentioned Pseudomonas lucifera Molisch—ereen, blue,
and violet. This is the first established case where colors have been
seen through the spectrum in the light of a plant.

It is possible to state, on account of the spectroscopic composition
of fungous light, that it may be made to act on photographic plates.
In fact, the researches of various investigators—as Von Haren, Nor-
man, Forster, Barnard, and especially R. Dubois—have taught us
that photographs can be taken by bacterial hght. If one uses in-
tensely luminous bacteria, such as are at my disposal, it is possible
to make photographs of bacteria colonies by their own hght by an
exposure of five minutes, and if bacteria lamps are employed, to make
good pictures of various objects, such as busts, thermometers, and
printed matter. In the last instance, however, to secure sharp pic-
tures, the time of exposure must be several hours. On the other
hand, if merely an impression upon the plate is desired, a single
second of time is sufficient to secure an image of a luminous-streak
culture. All pictures so far produced have been the result of light
from colonies or mass cultures. But it appears to me not at all im-
probable, in view of the practically unlimited sensitiveness of pho-
tographic plates, that hereafter it may be possible to photograph a
single bacterium cell by means of its own light, in the same way as

we have succeeded in rendering visible by means of the photographic
plate stars in the heavens which are invisible to the naked eye.

The discovery of Réntgen-Becquerel rays and of the emanations
proceeding from radioactive elements make opportune the thought
that rays of particular quality may also exist in bacterial light. Still
the assertion made by R. Dubois that bacterial light has the power
of penetrating opaque bodies, like wood and cardboard, is based
upon an illusion brought about through the direct action of the wood
or paper material on the salts of silver. On the same basis, I am
able to explain the remarkable, and from the standpoint of physics
utterly puzzling, statements of the Japanese investigator, Muraoka,
in regard to the light of the firefly. Fungous light—and the same
is true of the hght of the firefly—acts upon the salts of silver hke
ordinary daylight, and is incapable of penetrating opaque objects.

It seems to me to be not without interest that bacterial hg@ht also
brings about physiological results in plants. Helotropic sensitive-
ness is, according to Wiesner, of remarkable intensity, especially in
the case of the etiolated seedlings of certain plants. Such plants can
discriminate better than the human eye between the most minute dif-
ferences in light intensity and may therefore with justice be con-

LUMINOSITY IN PLANTS. 3861

sidered as excellent physiological photometers. This extraordinary
light sensitiveness induced me to test experimentally the heliotropic
power of bacterial light. In fact this light can bring about positive
heliotropism in various seedlings, such as the lentil, the pea, and the
vetch; and in fungi, as Phycomyces and Xylaria Hypoxylon. We
have here a striking spectacle, that of one plant influencing another
in its movements; the bacteria, by their production of radiant energy
in the form of light, compelling the stem of a plant to extend its
growth almost directly toward the source of illumination. Bacterial
light does not, however, show itself capable of causing the production
of chlorophyl, probably because the ght is not sufficiently intense
for this process. :

We come now to the question whether so striking a phenomenon as
this development of light in plants gives indication of being of any
practical benefit to them. Zoologists seem to agree that ight among
the animals is of great importance. For when we consider the in-
stantaneous and explosive generation of light, the sudden expulsion
of a luminous secretion and the wonderful construction of a light-pro-
ducing apparatus in animals inhabiting the darkest depths of the
sea, we can have no doubt that such constructions are of service to
the organisms, and that a definite use is served by this light-devel-
opment in the case of many zoological forms. Thus these creatures
may, by means of their light, either allure or frighten, or may illum1-
nate their surroundings in order to more easily and successfully cap-
ture their prey.

The question in the case of plants is far more difficult to answer.
The idea has been advanced that the light capacity of the bacteria
may be a means of their distribution. The hght of those bacteria
occurring in decaying sea animals is said to attract certain animals
along the seashore to feed upon these and by scattering the bacteria
to aid in their dissemination. I agree with Beijerinck that, as sea
currents, waves, and the sand along the shore bring about the dis-
semination of these bacteria in the most admirable manner, the before-
mentioned opinion is untenable.

There may be some doubt in the case of Iuminous mushrooms; in
fact, a well-known biologist, Von Kerner, has expressed the opinion
that the hght of the mushroom points out the way for fungus gnats
and fungus beetles, which lay their eggs in the mycelium and spore-
bearing tissues of these Hymenomycetes; so that these creatures are
in this way of service to the fungus by transporting its spores. At
first sight this theory seems to have much in its support, but on
closer examination we find there is not a little against it. Thus, in
the case of the mushroom Agaricus melleus, it is difficult to under-
stand why the gills, which bear the spores and are easily penetrated
by insects, are not luminous, while the myceleum, growing under

sm 1905 27

362 LUMINOSITY IN PLANTS.

tree bark or in the wood, is luminous. The luminous fungus threads
growing in phosphorescent wood produce, as a rule, no fruit-bearing
organs whatever. If the idea of this hght of the myceleum were to
allure insects or maggots, the result would be simply the destruction
of the fungus, for by attracting these animals it would not be dis-
seminated, but fed upon, and thereby destroyed, so that its hght
would be its ruin. Or if the hight of the plant were to serve the
purpose of enticing animal forms at might, it is not easy to under-
stand why the plant is not luminous merely at night instead of unin-
ierruptedly by day and by night—that is, at times when the light is
wholly imperceptible to these animals. In the case of plants the
question is a radically different one from that in the case of ani-
mals, and under these circumstances it seems to me better to forego
speculations and simply to rest on the fact that at the present time we
are unable to give any plausible teleological explanation of luminous-
ity in the Fungi; perhaps, indeed probably, because it 1s nothing more
than an inevitable consequence of the transforming of substances in
the luminous Fungi.

If, in conclusion, we glance at our problem from the standpoint of
dynamics, it is seen that, in company with various forms of energy
in the plant, as heat, electricity, and chemical energy, radiant energy
can also be produced in the form of light. A wondrous factor! The
green cell in its minute microscopic laboratory, the chlorophyl
grain, lays hold upon the energy emanating from the sun and trans-
forms the living force of the light ray into chemical energy. Thereby
is produced from the carbonic-acid gas of the atmosphere, with lb-
eration of oxygen, organic matter—a storehouse of potential force.
This organic matter enters as food into luminous animals and
luminous plants, and there by transmutation produces once more
heat and hght.

Truly a cyele from light to hight in the plant! In fact, the light
of the living organism is governed by the energy of the sun. When
the hght of the glowworm, hidden in the grass, pours forth, direct-
ing by its lantern the way for its amorous mate; when the Voctdluca
or Peridinew, disturbed by the ship’s keel or whipped by the waves,
suddenly gleam forth; when the sea crabs on the floor of the ocean
illuminate the darkness with their organs of hght, or when luminous
bacteria in decaying flesh or shining mushrooms in old forests flood
their surroundings with magic twilight, this hght of the organism is
fundamentally nothing other than the radiating energy of the sun
caught up by the plant and transformed into light. It is the new-
born sunlight of the plant,

DISTRIBUTION AND DISPERSION OF THE LYRE BIRD.

The Victoria lyre birds are restricted to the densely timbered,
inoist, hilly, and mountainous parts of eastern Victoria, for they must
have abundance of moisture, and food consisting of insects, grubs,
worms, etc. The Melbourne to Sydney railway may be taken as the
approximate western limit of these birds. They have not been found
to the west of that line, nor even nearly up to it in many parts. The
reason apparently is that no densely timbered and scrubby humid
‘anges, with permanent creeks in them, occur to the west of this line
on the northern side of the main divide, for neither Futter’s Range
nor the Mokoan Range near Benalla possesses these characteristics.
The main divide itself, where the railway crosses it at Kilmore June-
tion, at an altitude of 1,145 feet, is rather low, and is not—apparently
never was—densely scrubbed. Again, although eminently suitable
country for these birds is comprised by the Macedon Ranges and
those in the Blackwood district, near and on the main divide, also by
the Otway Ranges, no lyre birds are found there. In the case of the
last, the reason is undoubtedly its isolation. It is completely cut off
from the other hilly and mountainous districts of Victoria by the
great volcanic plains of the western district, which would form an
effectual barrier to the dispersion of the lyre bird southward, even if
it were present on the main divide to the north. The bird is so shy
that, unless abundant cover be quite close at hand, it will not, under
ordinary circumstances, venture into the open forest country, much
less cross wide tracts devoid of arboreal vegetation. It is not so obvi-
ous why the lyre bird is not present in the thickly timbered and
scrubby country of the Macedon Ranges, but apparently this also is
due to its comparative isolation. On the east it is separated by a wide
dissected volcanic plain, forming a natural barrier. The only prac-
ticable bridge of dispersion exists in the main divide itself, which
from Wandong on the railway takes a general northwesterly course

to Mount William, thence southwesterly and southerly to Mount
Macedon. About Mount William itself there was, in its original
state, a small area which might have been suitable for lyre birds, but
on the portions between Wandong and Macedon the want of sufficient
moisture and scrub 1s perhaps the reason of their absence. The birds
seem to have spread over southeastern Australia from New Guinea by
following through Queensland and New South Wales the mountains
that form the watershed between the Darling-Murrumbidgee basin
and the Pacific Ocean; and this within comparatively recent time,
considered from a geological point of view.

It is a matter for wonder that in suitable country lyre birds have
existed in such numbers as they have done. The native carnivorous
fauna destructive to them comprise the dingo or wild dog (Canis
dingo), the “ tiger cat” (Dasyurus maculatus), and the “ native cat”
(D. viverrinus). These animals, especially the first two—which are
much less numerous than the “ native cats ”—frequent lyre-bird coun-
try. These birds build their nests in spots usually accessible to
dingoes, and easily so to the chmbing “ cats.” They have almost in-
variably only one young one a year, and yet in most of Gippsland
and the northeastern district lyre birds exist in much greater numbers
than many of the other larger birds which nest in much less dangerous
situations, such as the gray magpie, king lory, wonga-wonga, and
bronze-winged pigeons, laughing jackass, and black cockatoo. The
lyre bird is a day bird and roosts in trees at night, so except at nesting
time it is practically safe from attack. It is a strong, active bird, and
could, even 1f attacked by a “cat” in a tree, either free itself or drag
the “ cat ” to the ground in its first struggle: But it is comparatively
helpless when in the nest, and certainly the young are completely so.
One fact, however, aids in its protection. The nest is usually not
sasily seen, especially if the female bird is inside with her tail raised
over her head, as is her wont, thus nearly filling up the entrance and
breaking the noticeable black cavity of the empty nest.

Near the source of the King River I have seen the birds going to
roost in tall green trees. They can not fly upward like an ordinary
bird, but rather partially Jump upward in a slanting direction with
their outspread wings aiding them by soaring, not flapping. To get
into these tall young trees, ranging up to nearly 100 feet in height,
they went up by stages, taking advantage of short and long tree ferns
and the branches of smaller trees.

DESTINY OF THE LYRE BIRD.

But the days of the lyre bird are numbered unless it develops the
habit of nesting in trees or spots inaccessible® to its far more dan-
gerous enemy, an introduced one, the European fox. Scattered
feathers and occasional feet are frequently met with in some parts of
the country and attest the depredations of the fox, which has now
spread over nearly the whole, if not the whole, of the State, and has
moreover, developed the faculty of ascending slightly leaning trees.

As regards South Gippsland the lyre bird is doomed to extinction,
and that by the agency of man. The mass of hilly country between
the valleys of the Latrobe on the north; the Tarago, Lang Lang, and
the Bass on the west; the Powlett and Tarwin and the narrow strip
between Foster and Merriman Creek on the south and southeast, was
a large tract, covered with an extremely dense vegetation and in a
continuously moist or wet state before settlement took place. It was
united to the main mass of the mountain system of eastern Victoria
by a narrow elevated tract of volcanic and similarly timbered country
between Warragul and Longwarry. In every gully and on every
spur the lovely notes of the lyre bird could be heard, and evidence
of its occupation could be seen on every hand. Thousands of these
birds must have sported about this country, making the otherwise
rather silent forest a huge natural concert hall. Now, alas, the
march of settlement, with its breechloaders, forest spohation, and
bush fires, has brought about a sad change from a naturalist’s point
of view. With the disappearance of the scrub goes the lyre bird,
and as the country gets cleared from various sides, so patches only of
scrubby country are left. These become the temporary home of such
of the outcasts as have escaped the gun, the clearing, and the fire, till
they, in their ae become felled and burnt, when the lyre birds dis-
appear.

NEST, EGG, AND YOUNG.

During my geological survey of the Victorian coal-fields area in
South Gippsland in the year 1900 I was camped on the Foster River
near Jumbunna, on the edge of a belt of natural forest of an ex-
tremely dense character. This scrub was the home of scores of lyre
birds, whose lovely notes could be heard all through the day.

Several nests of these birds were found, and as many observations
made concerning the birds and their habits as time and opportunity
permitted. One nest was situated in the side of one of the short,
deep channels (“ blind creeks ”) that drained the swampy portion of
the river flat. As is customary in South Gippsland, the timber had

366 NOTES ON THE VICTORIA LYRE BIRD.

been taken “in the face ”—1. e., all the scrub and trees up to, say, 4
feet 6 inches in diameter had been felled, but as they had not then been
burnt they lay in hopeless confusion, forming a tangled mass of logs,
branches, and scrub, through which young scrub was growing. It
was, therefore, an awkward place for stock, or even human beings,
to get into—a fact that some of the birds had apparently recognized
by building their nests in it. Across the river lay the natural forest
forming the feeding and sporting ground of the birds, and contain-
ing some nests also. I found the nest in question one morning by
noticing the female bird fly, or rather float, noiselessly away from the
place on my approach. This is a common practice with the lyre bird.
A young bird, unfeathered save for tufts of down on its crown and
upper back and a few young feathers just breaking forth on the
crown, Was in the nest. It screeched so vigorously on being disturbed

that the female bird quickly appeared, making meanwhile a semi-
clucking noise, somewhat similar to that of a domestic hen calling
her chicks. Whenever the little one gave its whistling screech the
mother made this noise and also gave vent to her own quaintly me-
lodious notes, sounding like * Koo-wuk’, koo-wuk’, koo-wow’,” with
a growl-like roll on the wow, and “* Qua-ack’, qua-ack’,” some like
the guttural of the common opossum. On calming down after the
young birds stopped screeching she imitated various birds,’ princi-
pally the tits, serub wrens (Sericornis), coachwhip bird (Psophodes
crepitans), king lory (Aprosmictus cyanopygius), magpie (Gym-
norhina leuconota), gray magpie (Strepera cuneicaudata), laughing
jackass (Dacelo gigas), black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus funereus) ,
butcher bird (Cracticus destructor), sparrowhawk (Accipiter cir-
hocephalus), ete-—principally the first three. She then walked lei-
surely down the sloping log, stopping every now and then to scratch
it—simply through force of habit, for it was quite dry and sound—
and then jumped onto the ground and resumed her scratching. All
this time she was giving a refined rendering of the liquid notes of the
common magpie.

The place was a very unsuitable one for the camera, and, being
alone, there was difficulty in getting the photograph of the adult bird
(see plate m1). She was very restless, and as a time exposure was
necessary, I was compelled to focus the camera on a certain part of
the log where she stayed for a second or two while walking down it.
Then, as I could get no stick long enough to touch the young one
from my post at the camera, I collected pieces of mud and earth, and
threw bits of these into the nest. Whenever one hit the little bird a
screech followed, and the mother was on the log like a flash, but keenly
alert and ready to float into the scrub at the least sign of danger.

a This is a very important note. Hitherto it was believed that only the male
lyre bird mimicked.—Eds.
NOTES ON THE VICTORIA LYRE BIRD. 367

On one occasion September 22, 1900, when setting up the camera
opposite the nest, I heard a slight sound, and, looking up, found the
bird on the log within 2 feet of my head. I had not touched the
young one, so it had not screeched, and the mother had, therefore,
not betrayed herself sooner. All the while I was setting up the
camera she moved about the log within a few feet of me, occasionally
putting her expanded tail over her head and quietly warbling

an
alert, observant, fearless spectator. Now and then the young bird
gave its whistling screech, when the old one evinced great distress and
moved to a position that gave her a view 6f the nest, though she
never went near it all the time. Whenever I stooped or sat down on
the ground she got suspicious and hopped round till seeing me, then
walked up quite close to see what was being done. Of my whistling
she took very little notice, of talking none at all, but started at once
at a gruff noise like coughing.

One of her most graceful movements was walking along the
swaying frond of a tree fern. As the frond bent under her weight
she gradually reversed her position till she was hanging head down-
ward, suspended by her claws, and quietly warbling the while.
This bird was the most sensible of any of the kind that I have
seen. She seemed to realize at once that I had no intention of
hurting the young one, and though evincing every sign of great
distress while her offspring was screeching, became quite reassured
of its safety when the screeches ceased.

The bird frequently walked down the log while I was standing
at the nest with my head within 2 feet of her. Once I touched
her feet with my hand, and I think with a little time and patience
I could have caught her. Several times I made a grab at her leg,
but she only jumped and floated away to another log, without
evincing any signs of fear. Again, to test her timidity, I shouted,
waved my arms, and threw little sticks at her without frightening
her from her position, and even when one stick hit her on the head
she simply floated to another log and resumed her observations.

The entrance to the nest can be seen just on the right of the
log under the tail of the bird and just to the left of the extremity of
the blackbutt spray with large leaves.

The picture of the young bird (plate tv) shows it resting in
my hat, surrounded with sprigs of tree fern (Alsophila australis),
dogwood (Cassinia aculeata), blackbutt (Hucalyptus pilularis), musk
(Aster argophyllus), and laurel (Pittosporum undulatum). It was
very frightened when first taken out of the nest, but soon rested
quite contentedly in the hat while being photographed.

When in the nest it commenced to screech immediately anything
appeared in the entrance, and thrust itself back as far as it could,
meanwhile keeping almost on its back, with its powerful feet pushed

out in front, and screeching. As it grew older it sometimes pecked
at my hand when thrust into the nest and always screeched. This,
however, was never long sustained, except on movement of the
hand, and it remained quite still if the hand were still.

I watched it carefully till it was nearly fledged, but one day T heard
the distress signal several times in rapid succession. On reaching
the place I found the poor creature dead in the nest. It had suffered
no apparent injury, there were no signs of damage to the nest or
of any struggle, and the only conclusion I could come to was that
it had been bitten by#a tiger snake (loplocephalus curtus). The
nest was in the side of the gully, about 5 feet from the bottom, and
easily accessible to animals and reptiles. The snake had, I think,
put its head into the nest, been pecked by the bird, and after at once
biting it had withdrawn and disappeared. I made careful search to
confirm this view, but could not, as the place afforded no chance of
seeing a snake track of any kind. Had a fox killed it, the bird would
undoubtedly have been dragged out of the nest. The snake, as
every bushman knows, is of a very enterprising nature and _ par-
ticularly partial to exploring nests of birds, whether on the ground
or in trees and scrub. IT have nearly tramped on one crawling along
a scrub-suspended fallen tree, at a height of 10 feet from the ground,
the snake being there probably with the dual view of getting direct
sunlight and young birds, and I for less laborious and quicker prog-
ress than was practicable in the tangled vegetation on the ground.

In the case of another nest near I found there was no sign of any
old bird until the young one screeched on being touched. Then, like
a flash, the female bird was on the spot, uttering notes somewhat sim-
ilar.to those of a “ clucking hen.” On seeing me she flew first into a
tree fern, watching intently meanwhile, then onto the ground and
scratched away, gradually working up almost to within kicking dis-
tance. All this time she quietly imitated three or four notes of the
magpie and those of a few other birds. When any movement was
made she jumped or ran away a few yards and resumed her quest for
grubs. When the young one screeched rapidly several times in suc-
cession the mother, after giving her answering call, * koo-wuk’, koo-
wuk’,” made a noise like a woman in hysteria.. She calmed down
when the young one stopped its noise, and with a grating, purring
noise floated down to the ground and resumed seratching.

The young one when found on August 11, 1900, was probably about
two days old. It had dewn on the crown and upper back, the rest of
it being bare, showing the whole of the skin to be of a bluish-drab
color. The abdomen was an abnormal size and the vent large, char-
acteristics of all the young found. On September 11, on my ap-
proaching the nest, the young one jumped out, but was caught, when
it screeched and struggled violently, using its feet vigorously. It

was most unwilling to enter the nest and. acted like the other one
when placed therein. On September 16 I again visited the nest with
.a view to photographing it, but, as feared, found it empty.

Another young one nearly full grown sat up silently in the nest
when found, but when touched it struggled and screeched, using its
claws freely. In this case the female bird came rushing up at once,
but on seeing me darted back into the scrub and ran round the nest,
making meanwhile her “ koo-wuk’, koo-wuk’,” and in addition the
“clungk, clungk,” or “ buln, buln,” that lyre birds make when undis-
turbed in the scrub. This nest was within half a mile of Jumbunna
township, in an easily penetrable patch of scrub, which probably ac-
counted for the timidity of the parent bird.

For the descriptions of nest, egg, etc., reference should be made to
Mr. A. J. Campbell’s and Mr. Robert Hall’s descriptions in their
publications. Nevertheless, I shall give a few further personal ob-
servations. Nests have been found in various places. ‘The one most
favored by the bird in South Gippsland is the side of a deep channel
cr creek under a slightly overhanging bank, with ferns and leaves
about (see plate vy). Another favorite one is among the roots of
a large fallen tree several feet from the ground with vegetation grow-
ing out of the contained earth. In the Baw Baw and Walhalla dis-
tricts Mr. J. Easton tells me that a large proportion of the nests
occurs in tall stumps of trees. All the nests are placed so that the
bird can have a clear space through which to fly or float out of sight
on the approach of danger.

It has been stated that once a lyre bird’s egg has been touched by
human hands the bird deserts the nest. However true this may be in
individual cases, it by no means is general. On August 26, 1900, T
found a nest in South Gippsland and handled the egg. Between
this date and September 13 I handled the egg on six different occa-
sions. On the last visit the egg was quite cold, and the nest appeared
to have been deserted, but on again visiting it on the 15th a young
one, apparently just hatched, was in it. The young bird was par-
tially covered with down, as in the cases of those already mentioned.
On September 23, 1900, the feathers were just showing through the
skin on the top of the wings and the upper back. Further obser-
vations on this I had no opportunity to make, on account of leaving
the locality. During this survey several abandoned nests, each with
one egg, were found. In these cases I do not think that the nests
had been voluntarily abandoned, but that the birds had been killed.

All the young birds mentioned in this article were sent to the
National Museum, Melbourne, where they can be seen in the scenic
case of the lyre birds.

DANCING GROUNDS.

These dancing grounds are open spaces, generally about 3 feet.
in diameter, situated preferably in a rather clear place in a patch of
dense scrub. In some cases they are raised several inches above the
general level of the surrounding ground, while in others there is little
or no difference in level. The surface, which is flat, appears to have
been scratched up by the birds, and the sticks, roots, and pieces of
grass or creepers thrown to one side. Numerous examples have
been noted in various parts of eastern Victoria, but in no case have I
seen any evidence of a beating down of the surface. They all had
a more or less freshly scratched appearance. On only one occasion
have I been fortunate enough to see the birds dancing. This was on
the top of Mount Wild Boar, about 8 o’clock on a foggy morning
(March 19, 1896). When walking quietly alone along a track I sud-
denly heard and immediately saw two male birds performing on one
of these grounds. ‘They were alternately advancing and receding, turn-
ing, bowing, whirling, hopping, and running about round the ground.
While doing this they raised and lowered their tails repeatedly.
Sometimes they put their heads through their raised tails, and, turn-
ing them, seemed to be admiring the lyre designs thereon. At the
same time they were, in rather subdued tones, whistling beautifully
and mimicking all the forest birds. One female bird walked quietly
round the dance, making a few short, hen-like notes, and_pre-
tended to pick up a grub here and there and to be unconcerned about
the dance. She, however, cast occasional glances at the male birds,
and was doubtless making her choice of a mate. I was in a hurry to
search for a missing horse, and could not watch them for more than
a few minutes, so quietly went past and left them undisturbed.

MIMICRY.

The lyre bird is an extraordinarily good mimic. No sound is too
difficult for it to reproduce, and the imitation, in the case of all sweetly
musical notes, is an exact reproduction of the originals, while of those
of a harsh nature it is a highly refined imitation. Its rendering of
the rich liquid notes of the gray magpie (Strepera cuneicaudata), the
butcher bird (Cracticus destructor), the gray thrush (Collyriocincla
harmonica),and the magpie (Gymnorhina leuconota and G, tibicen) 1s
superb; similarly with the chirp and twitter of the small scrub wrens
and tits. In the case of the laughing jackass (Dacelo gigas) the
harsh, grating, laughter-like effort of this quaint bird is rendered in a
manner so refined as to afford a pleasing contrast with the original.
The swish of the coach-driver’s whip, the sound of the saw and ax,
which I have heard on the Blacks Spur and near Marysville, are per-
fect deceptions, and the rapidity with which the notes of various

birds are rendered, the gliding of one bird’s notes into those of an-
other, and the rendering of two or more simultaneously are nothing
short of marvelous. The male bird is much the better and more
powerful whistler, but the female is practically as good a mimic. I
have no doubt that the lyre bird is a mocking bird, for, even supposing
it to owe to heredity its faculty for ‘mitating the birds of the forest,
as has been suggested, it can have acquired the art of imitating
sounds of human origin only since the settlement of the country in
which it is found.

LYRE BIRDS IN CAPITIVITY.

It is generally supposed that these birds can not be reared and kept
in captivity. Several attempts have, I believe, been made in the
Zoological Gardens, Melbourne, but the birds have always died in a
short time. There are several instances known, however, in which
such attempts have been successful. The most notable one is that of
wu resident of the Woods Point district (Upper Goulburn), who, so
Mr. O. A. L. Whitelaw tells me, reared several of these birds, which
fed with the fowls and were quite tame. The owner decided upon
proceeding to America to exhibit the birds as one of the curiosities of
Australia, but before matters had been arranged all of them were
poisoned, it was supposed, by some malicious person.“

Other instances have been cited of a lyre bird having been reared
and kept for lengthened or brief periods of time” in the Drouin,

aWriting under “ Nature notes” in The Argus of July 28, 1905, Mr. Donald
Macdonald incidentally substantiates this fact. A correspondent, Mr. J. C.
Mahan, of Woods Point, in giving some particulars about saving and keeping
lyre birds in captivity, states: “* When I found a nest I left the chicken for thirty
days after it was hatched; then snared the old bird, and carried them with the
nest to a large wire-netted aviary. The chicken was thus fed naturally by the
mother. On one occasion I had a chicken in the nest for forty-two days. <A
bird that had been in my aviary for three or four years developed only three of
the ‘fronded feathers.’ In my opinion the male bird does not reach its full
plumage for eight years. I have never found more than 24 of the brown bars on
a mature bird. It was a tedious and difficult task to accustom my birds to
artificial food, and I lost thirteen before succeeding. The proof that I got the
right system in the end was shown in the fact that after my birds had been
maliciously poisoned they were opened and found to be lined with healthy fat,
as the saying is. The late Mr. A. C. Le Souéf offered me £40 for the collection,
and later Jamrach’s agent offered £115 a pair for three domesticated pairs,
to be delivered in London. I was going to accept this offer, when all my birds
were poisoned; then I lost heart and gave it up. If the national park is ever
established some lyre birds should be turned down there. With the right con-
ditions they would breed in captivity. The experience of my own aviary
satisfied me as to that.’—Hds.

bMr. F. P. Godfrey in The Emu (Vol Y., p. 33) mentions Mr. S. McNeilly, of
Drouin, having had a male lyre bird in a state of domestication for twenty
years. A photograph of this particular bird is herewith given. (See Plate
VI.)—Eds.

Loch, and Omeo districts. Personally, I think it would be im-
practicable to keep a bird in captivity even after rearing it unless it
had access to some scrub affording shelter and a supply of insects.

GENERAL NOTES.

Though lyre birds are chiefly found in the dense scrubby forest,
they at times can be seen in fairly open country, but in such cases
there is dense scrub at hand, and they disappear into this on the
first approach of danger. In South Gippsland, where I have seen
and heard hundreds of these birds, I never once saw them singing
in cleared land, or even in open forest. Moreover, in no instance
have I seen them feeding or running about on open ground. On
one occasion I noticed about eight of them cross a narrow strip
of cleared ground, about 5 chains wide, from one patch of scrub
to another. They did this just before dusk by running quickly,
jumping over logs, and floating, one after the other. During the
great bush fires in South Gippsland in 1898 hundreds of lyre birds
were burnt or starved, and I have been told by settlers that in the
Jeetho district some of these birds came out of the burnt scrub and
fed among the fowls near the farmhouses. This was doubtless owing
to the destruction of insect hfe. It would indicate that they could
in necessity become graminivorous birds. Mr. J. W. Bainbridge
informs me that two lyre birds have become so tame near Mrs.
Manfield’s Temperance Hotel, at the foot of Mount Buffalo, that
Mr. Manfield has photographed one of the pair perched on the fence
near the place.

Lyre birds may be seen at altitudes from 100 feet above sea level
in the dense gullies of South Gippsland to those of close on 6,000
feet, or as high as arboreal vegetation ascends, in the Australian
Alps. In November, 1890, when returning to Harrietville from
Mount Feathertop (6,303 feet), im the Australian Alps, I saw be-
tween twenty and thirty male and female lyre birds on the stunted
snow gums (/. paunciflora) on the high ridge running from Feather-
top and separating the Ovens River from Snowy Creek. They were
at an altitude of about 5,700 feet and near the timber line. It was
nearly sunset when I was surprised to hear a medley of melodious
sounds, as if all the birds of the bush were singing their best and
loudest. Being alone and on foot, I was in their midst before they
noticed me, but to my surprise they not only remained jumping about
the trees, or with heads inclined watched me from the branches, but
many of them continued their unsurpassable mimicry of other forest
birds. I regretted that approaching darkness did not allow me to
stay and watch them longer. At altitudes of from 5,000 feet te the
timber line I have seen these birds, or evidence of them, on the high
NOTES ON THE VICTORIA LYRE BIRD. one

Gibbo Range, Mount Wild Boar, Mount Bogong, Mount Stirling, in
Benambra, Victoria, and on the high timbered spurs of Mount
Kosiciusko, New South Wales.¢| Once, when camped, on March 20,
1896, on the summit of Mount Wild Boar, at an altitude of over
5,000 feet, I was awakened shortly after sunrise by beautiful and
spirited whistling outside the tent entrance. On jumping up I found
a male bird peering into the tent from a branch only a few feet away.
After putting the camera together as hastily as circumstances per-
mitted I had the mortification of seeing the bird glide away into the
thick scrub just as I was about to take the photograph. Mr. Bain-
bridge informs me that he has heard during the winter,a lyre bird
whistling on Mount Buffalo at an altitude of 3,500 feet and quite
close to snow.

Lyre birds are very inquisitive when found in districts or places
where they have not been molested by man. On passing through
such country one is sometimes escorted for some distance by these
birds, which pass from tree to tree along the line of march. I have been
informed by Messrs. W. Baragwanath, jr., and J. Kaston, that once
when they were surveying a line on the flanks of Mount Baw Baw <«
female bird came close up to the chain, watched it intently, and fol-
lowed it as it was dragged along. Every time they made a noise the
bird gave the well-known alarm whistle and darted into the scrub,
to return almost immediately and repeat these tactics for some time.
On another oceasion, in a creek near Mount Useful, a male bird
viewed them from blackwood trees 60 to 70 feet high and disappeared
only after several sticks had been thrown at him. On other occa-
sions they have brought these birds close up to themselves by whistling
the birds’ own notes, in the same way that the king lory can be
decoyed.

Unlike some of the native birds which give their songs at certain
times through the day, lyre birds may be heard in their haunts
any time from dawn till dusk, regardless of the nature of the
weather. On a misty day, when steady, light rain is falling, they
may, perhaps, be said to be heard to the greatest advantage.

Lyre birds are inveterate scratchers and are almost unceasingly
at such work, somewhere or other in the bush. They must do a
great deal of good by destroying myriads of insects destructive
to vegetation. Unwittingly they also do a certain amount of harm,
by partially obliterating tracks, filling up side cuttings and survey
trenches, and uprooting or burying survey pegs. Some years ago

aHitherto Menura victoria has been recorded for Victoria only, but it is natu-
ral to suppose that the same species is found in the ranges extending over the
border of New South Wales. It is probable that I. superba is not found south
of the Blue Mountains. If it exist farther south, it wouid be interesting to find
where the two species inosculate, if not intergrade.—Lds.
314 NOTES ON THE VICTORIA LYRE BIRD.

I remember seeing a recently made track over the Bogong Pass,
in Victoria, which had been rendered impracticable for horse traffic
though being filled up in some places with masses of rock, logs of
wood, and other débris. These had rolled down the steep sides of the
mountain on account of their supports of humus and soil having
been scratched away by these birds. Again, it is often impossible
to exactly locate a survey trench or peg in lyre bird (‘ pheasant,”
as it 1s called by selectors) country, sometimes even shortly after
they have been placed there. This causes some difficulty when the
blaze (ax-cut mark) on the tree has been destroyed by bush fires.
This habit of scratching among decayed vegetation and soil may
account for the abundance of lee which Mr. W. Bragwanath, jr..
informs me, are to be found on most of these birds in the Baw Baw
district of Gippsland.

I have spoken of the flight of lyre birds as a floating. As far
as I have noticed they do not rise upward in the air like a soaring
bird, and can not make a proper upward flight. But in going to
a lower place they simply jump off a log or rock into the air with
their wings outspread, and float or glide through it down a slope
into a gully, sometimes taking advantage, every here and _ there,
of a log or rock from which to get an additional spring. In a few
seconds they can descend several hundreds of feet with very little
apparent motion of the wings. It is an interesting sight to see the
dark brown form of a departing lyre bird as it hops on a fallen
iree, floats under a tree fern, or jumps off into space—silent, save
for its first shrill whistle of alarm. While lyre birds are fond of
tree-fern gullies and dogwood (Cassinia aculeata and C. longifolia) ,
“native hop” (Daviesia latifolia), and “ wild hop” (G@oodenia
evata) slopes and ridges, they are very partial to the patches of
“blanket wood” (Senecio bedford). This plant grows into small
trees with lateral branches, and large, thick leaves, arranged more
or less horizontally, thus forming a canopy. The ground beneath
is usually not covered with ferns and small plants, but with decayed
leaves and twigs, while the branches form convenient perches for
the lyre birds. There are thus open spaces between the foliage
and the ground, and the birds are fond of moving about in them,
hence the scrub is called locally “ pheasant scrub.”

I. P. Godfrey for six of the photographs which illustrate this

THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN THE
GENESIS OF SPECIES.*

By Jorn A. ALLEN.

Among biologists who accept the modern theory of evolution as
the only reasonable hypothesis available for the explanation of the
diversity of structure among organized beings, there is a wide differ-
ence of opinion as to what are the leading causes of differentiation.
The doctrine of natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, has
recently been brought prominently forward as the key to this complex
problem, and is upheld by a large class of enthusiastic adherents,
who accept it as the full solution of the whole question. By others
the conditions of environment are believed to be far more influential
in effecting a certain class of modifications, at least, than the neces-
sarily precarious influence of natural selection, which must take its
origin in isolated instances of variation in favorable directions, and
depend for its continuance upon these fortuitous advantages being
inherited by the descendants of the favored individuals in which they
originate. The modifying influence of conditions resulting from
geographic or climatic causes was long since noticed, and for nearly a
century has been considered by many writers as explanatory of much
of the diversity existing not only in the human race but among ani-
mals. It has, however, remained until recently vaguely grounded,
being based more in conjecture than on observed facts. Scarcely,
indeed, have two decades passed since the real nature and extent of
geographical variation among animals, and even as yet among only a
few species, began to receive careful attention, while only within the
last fifteen years has any attempt been made to correlate the ob-
served differences with the climatic or geographical conditions of
habitat. Only within recent years have the differences in general
size, and in the relative size of different parts, been ascertained by
careful measurement, and the differences in the character of the tegu-
mentary covering (as the pelage in mammals) and in color. in indi-

viduals of the same species inhabiting distant portions of a common
habitat, been duly recorded. In the work of registering these instruc-
tive data, it has fallen to Americans to take a leading part, large
credit in the matter being due not only to the activity of our profes-
sional biologists, but to the liberality of the General Government in
attaching competent natural history observers and collectors to the
humerous surveying parties it has sent out during the last twenty
years to explore the till then practically unknown geography and
productions of our western Territories.
The combined fruits of their labors, together with those of the
agents and correspondents of the Smithsonian Institution, have re-
sulted in the accumulation of an amount of material far exceeding
that elsewhere accessible to single investigators, representing, as it
does, at least two of the vertebrate classes of animals from the whole
North American continent so fully that generalizations may be made
from their study which could not otherwise have been reached for
many years and for which no similar facilities for any other equal
urea as yet exist. The recent investigations of American mam-
malogists and ornithologists have been in consequence largely di-
rected to the subject of geographical variation, and their publications
teem with tabulated measurements and records of variations in form
and color that accompany differences in the climatic or geographical
conditions of habitat. Among the results that have followed are the
discovery of numerous interesting geographical varieties or subspecies,
and the demonstration of the complete intergradation of many forms,
often quite widely diverse in color, size, and proportion of parts, for-
merly regarded (and properly so as then known) as unquestionably
distinet species, which discoveries have of course necessitated a large
reduction in the number of recognized “ specific ” or nonintergrading
forms. But most important of all has been the correlation of local
variations with the conditions of environment, and the deduction
therefrom of certain laws of geographical variation. Upon these
have been based hypotheses that go far toward explaining many of
the phenomena of intergradation and differentiation observed among
existing animals. In the present paper will be given not only a
summary of the results thus far attained, but enough of the details
of the subject to show the nature of the evidence on which rest the
conclusions already reached. These results, it is claimed, show that
other influences than natural selection operate powerfully in the
differentiation of specific forms, and that geographical causes share
more largely in the work than naturalists have heretofore been pre-
pared to admit—at least to consider as proven.
As is well known, animals vary greatly in respect to the extent of
the areas they inhabit. While a few species are nearly or quite cos-
mopolitan, many others are restricted to single small islands or to
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. oe

limited portions of a continent. Not a few range over the greater
part of whole hemispheres, while by far the larger number are con-
fined within comparatively narrow limits. Of the numerous species
of mammals and birds inhabiting North America, none are equally
common throughout the whole extent of the continent. The habitats
of a few only extend from the Barren Grounds of the Arctic regions
to Mexico, and from the Atlantic coast westward to the Pacific; one
or two only among the mammals range over the whole continent from
Alaska to Central America, while some occupy merely the extreme
boreal parts of the continent. The latter, in many cases, range also
over the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of the Old World. Others
extend from Arctic America southward to the United States. Still
others occupy only the middle or more temperate latitudes, being un-
represented in the extreme north or the extreme south. Others,
again, first appear in the middle or more southerly parts, and range
thence southward far into the Tropics. A large number are restricted
to the region east of the Rocky Mountains; others are confined to a
narrow belt along the Pacific coast; and others still to limited areas
of the great Rocky Mountain Plateau. In general, their distribution
accords with climatal regions or zones, their respective ranges being
limited in part by latitude and in part by geographical barriers, as
treeless, arid plains, or high mountain ranges. The northern and
southern boundaries of the habitat of a species are found to agree, not
generally with the arbitrary parallels of the geographer, but with
isothermal lines, these being more or less different for each species.
The geographical distribution of a species is thus mainly determined
by climatic or other physical causes, though in part, doubtless, by its
organic constitution. In most cases species that are wide ranging
are the most variable, as would naturally follow from their being sub-
jected, in the different portions of their habitats, to widely different
environing circumstances.

Hence such species are often found to run into numerous local races,
some of them greatly differing from others, but still inseparably
connected by individuals inhabiting the intervening regions. Over dis-
tricts slightly diversified, even if of large extent, species generally pre-
serve comparative constancy of character, while, conversely, local races
are of frequent occurrence in regions of alternating valleys, mountain
ranges, and table lands, and more especially is this true if the highly
diversified region be situated in the warmer latitudes. Small islands,
remotely situated from other lands, have usually many species pe-
culiar to themselves, their differentiation being proportionate to the
geologic antiquity of the islands and their remoteness from larger
land areas. In islands of recent origin and not widely separated
from continental lands, the ancestral stock of the species is still often

sm 1905——28
BTS) on PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES

clearly apparent, the forms thus differentiated through insular in-
fluences not having passed beyond the varietal stage; in other cases
they are specifically different from their nearest continental allies, or
may even have advanced far toward generic distinctness, while their
origin may still remain tolerably apparent.

Plasticity, or susceptibility to the influences of physical surround-
ings, often differs even among quite closely allied species, as those of
the same family or even genus, and different species are evidently
affected differently by the same circumstances. Variability in color
may or may not accompany variability in size or in the character of
partic ‘ular organs. Generally, however, a species which varies greatly
in one feature varies to a similar degree in many others. Species
having a wide geographical range not only commonly run into a
greater or less number of local races, but they generally present more
than the average amount of strictly individual variation, as though
species ranging widely in space were originally more plastic than
those having more circumscribed habitats, and were thus able more
easily to adapt themselves to their surroundings; they are also more
persistent, their fossil remains being far more frequently met with in
the quaternary deposits than are those of the more local and gener-
ally more specialized forms.

Geographical variation, as exhibited by the mammals and birds
of North America, may be summarized under the following heads,
namely, (1) variation in general size, (2) in the size of peripheral
parts, and (3) in color, the latter being subdivisible into (a) variation
in color with latitude and (b) with longitude. Asa rule, the mammals
and birds of North America increase in size from the south north-
ward. This is true not only of the individual representatives of each
species, but generally the largest species of each genus and family
are northern. There are, however, some strongly marked exceptions,
in which the increase in size is 1n the opposite direction, or southward.
There is for this an obvious explanation, as will be presently shown,
the increase being found to be almost invariably toward the region
where the type or group to which the species belongs receives its great-
est numerical development and where the species attain the largest
size, and are also most specialized. Hence the representatives of a
given species increase in size toward its hypothetical center of dis-
tribution, which is in most cases doubtless also its original center
of dispersal. Consequently there is frequently a double decadence
in size within specific groups, and both in size and numerically in the
case of species when the center of development of the group to which
they belong is in the warm temperate or tropical regions. This may
be illustrated by reference to the distribution of the higher classes
of vertebrates in North America. Among the species occurring north
of Mexico there are very few that may not be supposed to have had
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 379

a northern origin; and the fact that some are circumpolar in their
distribution while most of the others (especially among the mam-
mals) have congeneric Old World allies further strengthens the
theory of their northern origin. Not only do individuals of the
same species increase in size toward the north, but the same is true
of the species of the different genera. Again, in the exceptional cases
of increase in size southward, the species belong to southern types, or,
more correctly, to types having their center of development within or
near the intertropical regions, where occur not only the greatest num-
ber of the specific representatives of the type, but also the largest.

For more detailed illustration we may take three families of the
North American Carnivora—namely, the Canide (wolves and foxes),
the Felide (lynxes and wild-cats), and the Procyonidx (raccoons).
The first two are to some extent cosmopolitan, while the third is
strictly American. The Canide have their largest specific represen-
tatives the world over, in the temperate or colder latitudes. In
North America the family is represented by six species,’ the smallest
of which, speaking’ generally, are southern and the largest northern.
Four of them are among the most widely distributed of North
American mammals, two, the gray wolf and the common fox, being
circumpolar species; another, the Arctic fox, is also cireumpolar, but
is confined to high latitudes. The three widest-ranging species—the
gray wolf, the common fox, and the gray fox—are those which pre-
sent the most marked variation in size. Taking the skull as the
basis of comparison, it is found that the common wolf is fully one-
fifth larger in the northern parts of British America and Alaskz
than it is in northern Mexico, where it finds the southern limit of
its habitat. Between the largest northern skull and the largest
southern skull there is a difference of about 35 per cent of the mean
size’ Specimens from the intermediate region show a gradual inter-
gradation between these extremes, although many of the examples
from the upper Missouri country are nearly as large as those from
the extreme north.

The common fox, though occurring as far north as the wolf, is
much more restricted in its southward range, especially along the
Atlantic coast, and presents a correspondingly smaller amount of
variation in size. The Alaskan animal, however, averages about one-
tenth larger than the average size of specimens from New England.

a@The gray wolf (Canis lupus [=C. occidentalis and allied forms]), the
prairie wolf (C. latrans [now treated as a group of a dozen or more closely
related species and subspecies]), the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus [now sepa-
rated into several forms]), the common fox (V. aloper [=V. fulvus and numer-
ous related forms]), the kit fox (V. velox [now subdivided into several forms] ),
and the gray fox (Urocyon virginianus [=U. cinereoargenteus, with a dozen or
more subspecies] ).
380 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES.

In the gray fox, whose habitat extends from Pennsylvania southward
to Yucatan, the average length of the skull decreases from about 5
inches in Pennsylvania to considerably less than 4 in Central
America—a difference equal to about 30 per cent of the mean size for
the species.

The Felide, unlike the Canide, reach their greatest development,
as respects both the number and the size of the species, in the inter-
tropical regions. This family has but a single typical representa-
tive—the panther (/elis concolor)—north of Mexico, and this ranges
only to about the northern boundary of the United States. The other
North American representatives of the family are the lynxes, which,
in some of their varieties, range from Alaska to Mexico. They form,
however, the most northern as well as the most specialized or ‘* aber-
rant ” type of the family. While they vary greatly in color as well
as in the length and texture of the pelage at different localities, they
afford a most remarkable exception to all laws of variation in size
with locality; for a large series of skulls, representing localities as
widely separated as Louisiana, northern Mexico, and California on
the one hand and Alaska and the Mackenzie River district on the
other, as well as various intermediate localities, reveals no appreciable
difference in size throughout this wide area. The true cats, however,
as the panther and the ocelots, are found to greatly increase in size
southward or toward the metropolis of the. family. The panther
ranges from the Northern States southward over most of South
America. Skulls from the Adirondack region of New York have an
average length of about 74 inches, the length increasing to 8? in
Louisiana and Texas, from beyond which points there is lack of data.
The ocelot (Felis pardalis) finds its northern limit near the Rio
Grande of Texas, and ranges thence southward far into South
America. The average size of Costa Rican examples is about one-
fifth greater than that of specimens from the Rio Grande.

The Procyonide are chiefly represented in tropical America, a
single species—the common raccoon (Procyon lotor)—being found in
the United States, and thence northward to Alaska [=British Co-
lumbia]. Here again the increase in size is southward or toward
the metropolis of the family—Pennsylvania specimens averaging
about one-tenth smaller than Costa Rican examples.

The common otter (Lutra canadensis) affords another example of
increase in size southward among our Carnivora, although belonging
to a family essentially northern in its distribution. The otters, how-
ever, form a distinct subfamily, which attains its greatest number of
species in the warmer regions of the earth, and hence offers not an
exception to but a confirmation of the law of increase toward the
center of distribution of the group to which it belongs.

PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 381

Instances of increase in size northward among the Carnivora of
North America are so generally the rule that further space need not
be taken in recounting examples in detail. It may suffice to state that
the badger (Taxidea americana), the marten (J/ustela anericana),
the fisher (J/. pennant), the wolverine (Gulo luscus), and the ermine
(Putorius ermineus |= longicauda, cicognanii, novehoracensis.
ete.|)—all northern types—afford examples of variation in size
strictly parallel with that already noticed as occurring in the foxes and
wolves.

To refer briefly to other groups, it may be stated that the Cervide
(deer family) are mainly rather northern in their distribution; that
the largest species occur in the colder zones, and that individuals of
the same species increase rapidly in size toward the north. Some of
the species in fact afford some of the most striking instances of
northward increase in size, among which are the common Virginia
deer and its several representatives in the interior of the continent
and on the Pacific slope. It is also noteworthy that the most obvi-
ously distinctive characteristic of the group—the large, annually
deciduous antlers—reaches its greatest development at the north-
ward. Thus all the northern species, as the moose, the elk, and the
caribou, have branching antlers of immense size, while the antlers are
relatively much smaller in the species inhabiting the middle region of
the continent and are reduced to a rudimentary condition—a simple
slender sharp spike, or a small and singly forked one—in the tropical
species, the antlers declining in size much more rapidly than the
general size of the animal. This is true in individuals of the same
species as well as of the species collectively.

The Rodentia (the squirrels, marmots, spermophiles, mice, and
their affines) offer the same illustrations in respect to the law of
increase in size as the species already mentioned, the size sometimes
increasing to the southward, but more generally to the northward,
since the greater number of the species belong decidedly to northern
types. There is no more striking instance known among mammals
of variation in size with locality than that afforded by the flying
squirrels, in which the northern race is more than one-half larger than
the southern; yet the two extremes are found to pass so gradually
the one into the other that it is hardly possible to define even a
southern and a northern geographical race except on the almost
wholly arbitrary ground of difference in size. The species, moreover,
is one of the most widely distributed, ranging from the Arctic regions
(the northern limit of forests) to Central America.

Among birds the local differences in size are almost as strongly
marked as among mammals and, in the main, follow the same gen-
eral law. A decided increase in size southward, however, or toward

382 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES.

the warmer latitudes, occurs more rarely than in mammals, although
several well-marked instances are known. ‘The increase is generally
northward and is often very strongly marked. The greatest dif-
ference between northern and southern races occurs, as 1n mammals,
in the species whose breeding stations embrace a wide range of lati-
tude. In species which breed from northern New England to Flor-
ida the southern forms are not only smaller, but are also quite differ-
ent in color and in other features. This is eminently the case in the
common quail (Ortyx virginianus), the meadow lark (Sturnella
magna), the purple grackle (Quiscalus purpureus), the red-winged
blackbird (Agelwus pheniceus), the golden-winged woodpecker
(Colaptes auratus), the towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) , the Caro-
Jina dove (Zenedura carolinensis), and in numerous other species,
and is quite appreciable in the blue jay (Cyanurus cristatus), the
crow (Corvus americanus), i most of the woodpeckers, in the tit-
mice, Numerous sparrows, and several thrushes and warblers, the
variation often amounting to from 10 to 15 per cent of the average
size of the species.4

As a general rule certain parts of the organisms vary more than
does general size, there being a marked tendency to enlargement of
peripheral parts under high temperature or toward the Tropics;
hence southward in North America. This is more readily seen in birds
than in mammals, in consequence mainly of thei peculiar type of
structure. In mammals it is manifested occasionally in the size of
the ears and feet and in the horns of bovines, but especially and more
generally in the pelage. At the northward, in individuals of the same
species, the hairs are longer and softer, the under fur more abundant,
and the ears and the soles of the feet better clothed. This is not only
true of individuals of the same species, but of northern species col-
lectively, as compared with their nearest southern allies. Southern
individuals retain permanently in many cases the sparsely clothed
ears and the naked soles that characterize northern individuals only
in summer, as 1s notably the case among the different squirrels and
spermophiles. ;

In mammals which have the external ear largely developed, as the
wolves, foxes, some of the deer, and especially the hares, the larger
size of this organ in southern as compared with northern individuals
of the same species is often strikingly apparent. It is more especially
inarked, however, in species inhabiting extensive open plains and
semidesert regions. The little wood hare, or gray “ rabbit ” (Lepus

sylvaticus) “ affords a case in point. This species is represented in
some of its varieties across the whole breadth of the continent and
from the northern border of the United States southward to Central
America, but in different regions by different geographical races or
subspecies. In addition to certain differences of color and general
size, the ears vary still more strongly. In the form inhabiting the
Great Plains, commonly known as the little sagebrush hare (ZL. sy/va-
ticus nuttallc), the ears are considerably longer than in the eastern
variety and increase in size from the north southward, reaching their
greatest development in western Arizona and the desert region
farther westward and southward, where the variety of the plains
proper passes into still another variety characterized mainly by the
large size of its ears, which are in this race nearly twice the size they
attain in the eastern variety. In the large long-eared “ jackass ”
hares of the plains the ear likewise increases in size to the southward.
In Lepus callotis,® for example, which ranges from Wyoming south-
ward far into Mexico, the ear is about one-fourth to one-third larger
in the southern examples than in the northern. The little brown hare
of the Pacific coast (ZL. trowbridge’) presents a similar increase in
the size of the ear southward, as does to a less extent the prairie hare
(L. campestris). Not only are all of the long-eared species of Ameri-
can hares confined to the open plains of the arid interior of the conti-
nent, but over this same region is the tendency to an enlargement of
the ear southward stronger than elsewhere. It is also of interest in
this connection that the largest-eared hares of the Old World occur
over similar open, half-desert regions, as do also the largest-eared
foxes. On our western plains the deer are represented by a large-
eared species. Among the domestic races of cattle those of the
warm temperate and intertropical regions have much larger and
longer horns than those of northern countries, as is shown by a com-
parison of the Texan, Mexican, and South American breeds with
the northern stock, or those of the south of Europe with the more
northern races. In the wild species of the Old World the southern
or subtropical are remarkable for the large size of their horns. The
horns of the American pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are also
much larger at southern than at northern localities. Naturalists

have also recorded the existence of larger feet in many of the smaller
North American mammalia at the southward than at the northward
among individuals of the same species, especially among the wild
mice, in some of the squirrels, the opossum, and raccoon, as well as in
other species.

In birds the enlargement of peripheral parts, especially of the bill,
claws, and tail, is far more obvious and more general than in mam-
mals. The bill is particularly susceptible to variation in this regard,
in many instances being very much larger, among individuals of
unquestionably the same species, at the southward than at the north-
ward. ‘This accords with the general fact that all the ornithic types
in which the bill is remarkably enlarged occur in the intertropical
regions. The southward enlargement of the bill within specific
groups may be illustrated by reference to almost any group of North
American birds, or to those of any portion of the continent. As in
other features of geographical variation, the greatest differences in
the size of the bill are met with among species having the widest dis-
tribution in latitude. Among the species inhabiting eastern North
America we find several striking examples of this enlargement among
the sparrows, blackbirds, thrushes, crows, wrens, and warblers; in
the quail, the meadow lark, the golden-winged woodpecker, ete. Gen-
erally the bill in the slender-billed forms becomes longer, more atten-
uated, and more decurved (in individuals specifically the same) in
passing from the New England States southward to Florida, while
in those which have a short, thick, conical bill there is a general in-
crease In its size, so that the southern representatives of a species, as a
rule, have thicker and longer bills than their northern relatives,
though the birds themselves are smaller. There is thus not only gen-
erally a relative, but often an absolute, increase in the size of the bill
in the southern races. The species of the Pacific coast and of the
interior afford similar illustrations, in some cases more marked even
than in any of the eastern species. More rarely, but still quite fre-
quently, is there a similar increase in the size of the feet and claws.

The tail, also, affords an equally striking example of the enlarge-
ment of peripheral parts southward. Referring again to the birds of
the Atlantic coast, many of the above-named species have the tai!
absolutely longer at southern localities than at northern, and quite
often relatively longer. Thus, while the general size decreases, the
length of the tail is wholly maintained, or decreases less than the gen-
eral size; but in some cases, while the general size is one-tenth or
more smaller at the south the tail is 10 to 15 per cent longer than in
the larger northern birds. Some western species are even more re-

being annually cast and renewed, and are thus entirely different physiologically
from the horns of bovines, which retain a high degree of vitality throughout the
life of the animal.
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 885

markable in this respect, and in consequence mainly of this fact the
southern types have been varietally separated from the shorter-tailed
northern forms of the same species.

Variations. in color with locality are still more obvious, particu-
larly among birds, in which the colors are more positive, the con-
trasts of tint greater, and the markings consequently better defined
than is usually the case in mammals. The soft, finely divided
covering of the latter is poorly fitted for the display of the delicate
pencilings and the lustrous, prismatic hues that so often char-
acterize birds. Mammals, however, present many striking instances
of geographical variation in color.

As already stated, geographical variation in color may be con-
veniently considered under two heads. While the variation with
latitude consists mainly in a nearly uniform increase in one direc-
tion, the variation observed in passing from the Atlantic coast west-
ward is more complex. In either case, however, the variation results
primarily from nearly the same causes, which are obviously climatic,
and depend mainly upon the relative humidity or the hygrometric
conditions of the different climatal areas of the continent. In re-
spect to the first, or latitudinal variation, the tendency is always
toward an increase in intensity of coloration southward. Not only
do the primary colors become deepened in this direction, but dusky
and blackish tints become stronger or more intense, iridescent hues
become more lustrous, and dark markings, as spots and streaks or
transverse bars, acquire greater area. Conversely, white or light
markings become more restricted. In passing westward a general
and gradual blanching of the colors is met with on leaving the
wooded regions east of the Mississippi, the loss of color increasing
with the increasing aridity of the climate and the absence of forests,
the greatest pallor occurring over the almost rainless and semidesert
regions of the Great Basin and Colorado Desert. On the Pacific
slope north of California the color again increases, with a tendency
to heavy, somber tints over the rainy, heavily wooded region of the
northwest coast.

Geographical variation in color among mammals, for reasons
already stated, is generally, but not always, manifested merely
through the varying intensity or depth of the tints. It is, however,
often strongly marked. The common chickaree, or red squirrel
(Sciurus hudsonius), for example, which ranges from high northern
latitudes southward over the northern portion of the United States,
shows an increase in the color over the middle of the dorsal surface
from pale yellowish or fulvous to rufous. The fox squirrel of the
Mississippi Valley (Scturus niger, ludovicianus), which ranges from
Dakota southward to the Gulf of Mexico, has the lower parts, at
the northward, very pale yellowish white, which tint gradually in-
\

creases 1n intensity southward till in Louisiana it becomes deep red-
dish orange, the dorsal surface also becoming at the same time some-
what darker. Excepting the fox squirrels and a Pacific-coast variety
of the chickaree, all the squirrels ving north of Mexico have the
lower parts white, while those inhabiting tropical America have the
lower parts fulvous, deep golden, orange, or even dark brownish
red, specimens with the belly white being exceptional, though occa-
sionally occurring in several of the species.

Mammals tend strongly to run into melanitic phases, which are
especially developed at particular localities or over limited regions,
but whether or not the result of geographical influences is not clearly
evident. The whitening of the pelage in winter at the north in a
considerable number of species of mammals and in one genus of birds,
and not elsewhere, is, on the contrary, a strictly geographical phe-
nomenon, but seems to be the result of other than the ordinary causes
of geographical variation in color. Its occurrence in some species
and its absence in others closely allied to them is a fact not readily
explained. It shows, however, how differently different animals are
affected by the same influences. The change to a white winter livery
is more complete in the higher latitudes, where the whiteness per-
vades the pelage to a greater depth and continues for a longer period,
the change being only partial in the southern representatives of
species that exhibit this seasonal change of color.

In respect to southward increase in color among birds, a few ex-
amples only out of the many almost equally striking can be here
given. These will be chosen from widely different groups and will
represent localities remotely separated, as well as very diverse styles
of coloration. In comparing, for instance, New England examples
of the common quail with others from southern Florida the colors
are found to be so much stronger and darker in the southern birds
as to give the appearance of their being entirely distinct species,
particularly when the smaller size and larger bills of the southern
race are also considered. While in the northern birds the color of
the dorsal surface is gray and rufous, slightly varied with black, the
gray is wholly wanting in the the southern type, the rufous 1s much
stronger, and the black markings are very much broader. The lower
surface is varied by transverse bars of black and white, but while
in the northern birds the white bars are twice, or more than twice,
the width of the black ones, in the southern birds they are often of
equal width; or the black bars may be the broader, with much more
black bordering the white throat patch, giving, on the whole, a very
much darker aspect to this region of the body. Yet when a series
is brought together from many intermediate localities, there is found
to be a complete intergradation between the most extreme phases.
In the common towhee the style of coloration is entirely different
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 387
from that seen in the quail, the colors being chiefly massed in large
areas, with white markings on the wings and large white spots at
the ends of the outer tail feathers. In this species southern speci-
mens differ from northern ones in the black of the upper parts and
the chestnut of the sides being more intense, while the white markings
on the wings and tail are greatly reduced in area. In the northern
bird, four of the outer pairs of tail feathers have a large white spot
near the end, while in the southern form only three pairs are thus
marked.

In the purple grackle the plumage (in the males) is everywhere
black, with, at the north, greenish or bronzy reflections; in the south-
ern or Floridan form the black is more intense, and the reflections
are steel blue and purple, with iridescent bars across the middle and
lower parts of the back. In the northern form the female is dull
brownish-black, with little or no iridescence, while in the southern
form the female is nearly as lustrous as the northern male. The two
types differ so widely, not only in color, but, as previously noticed,
in size and in the form of the bill, that, without the connecting speci-
mens from intermediate localities, no ornithologist would hesitate
to regard them as entirely distinct species; and they were, indeed,
at one time so regarded. The red-winged blackbird has, excepting
its red wing patches, also a lustrous black plumage throughout, and
presents a similar range of variation in general color with the pre-
ceding; while the red of the wing patch becomes much darker at the
southward, and its creamy-white border seen in the northern form
changes to yellowish-orange in the southern.

The common blue jay, and the long-crested jays of the Rocky
Mountain region, may be cited as illustrations of southward increase
in brilliancy or intensity of coloring where the prevailing tint Is
blue; the green Mexican and Rio Grande jays of a passage from
yellowish-green tints into bright yellow; the yellow-throated warb-
lers (genus Geothlypis), several of the flycatchers (genera Myiarchus
and Z'yrannus), and the meadow lark, as examples of increase in the
area and intensity of yellow; several of the woodpeckers (genera
Centurus and Sphyrapicus), the cardinal finches (genus Cardinalis),
and some of the tanagers (genus Pyranga), of a similar increase
of red; the goldfinches (genus Chrysomtris), and most of the species
above named, of increase in extent and purity of black areas. The
Rocky Mountain jays have, at the northward, a large portion of the
plumage rather dark ashen, which farther southward becomes bluish
ash, and still farther south culminates, in the Central American
States, in blue. In the genus Geothlypis, the Maryland yellowthroat
(G@. triches), which ranges over the whole United States, and thence
far southward, has at the northward the abdomen whitish; more to
the southward, yellowish; and, in the West Indies, Mexico, and
388 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES,

northern South America, runs into races in which the abdomen is
bright yellow. At the same time the black markings about the head
increase in extent and purity and the general size becomes larger,
the group having its metropolis in the tropical regions. In conse-
quence of these variations in color and size this species at the south-
ward becomes differentiated into several more or less well-marked
subspecies (formally accorded full specific rank), which are con-
nected by an unbroken series of intergradations.

In the great-crested flycatcher (J/yiarchus crinitus) of the United
States the yellow of the abdominal region is much the stronger in
the southern birds, while the same is true of several of the western
species of the same genus, which at the southward also pass into sev-
eral recognizable subspecies.

The western goldfinch (Chrysomtris psaltria) affords a well-known
instance of increase of black. This species is found in the western
half of North America from about the parallel of 40° southward to
Ecuador. The northern form has the black of the upper parts
mainly restricted to the head, wing, and tail, the rest of the dorsal
surface being olive green. In northern Mexico the back begins to
be more or less clouded with black, which tint increases in extent in
Central America till it wholly replaces the olive green, while in
northern South America it becomes more intense and lustrous. In
northern specimens the tail is marked with white spots, which either
decrease greatly in size or become wholly obsolete in the southern
races. The extremes, as may well be imagined, are widely diverse in
their coloration and, though formally regarded as entirely distinct
species, have been found so thoroughly to intergrade that it is im-
possible to draw any lines of separation between the several races.
Lawrences’s flycatcher (J/yiarchus lawrence?) affords also a striking
example of southward increase in the area and intensity of black.
At the northward this species has a grayish-black crown, which grad-
ually passes southward into a form with the crown wholly deep
black. With the increase southward of the area and intensity of
black markings there is also in this, as in other species, a general
increase in the intensity or depth of the other accompanying tints.

The red-bellied, or Carolina, woodpecker (Centurus carolinus), a
common bird of the United States, shows a strong increase of red on
the head and lower surface of the body at the southward, in which
this tint is not only much brighter, but also much more extended in
the south Florida birds than in those from the Northern States. At
the same time it presents, in common with other species of the same
family, a marked southward decrease in the size of the white trans-
verse bars and spots of the dorsal plumage.

In the southern portion of the Mississippi Valley the variation is
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 389

in a tropical direction, and is merely due to the more northward ex-
tension there of tropical influences. In passing to the plains and the
Great Basin west of the Rocky Mountains, however, an entirely
different phase of color variation is met with. Here, as a general
rule, there is a loss of color, this region being characterized by the
presence of subdued or faded tints in the representatives of species
having a nearly continental range. The transition, however, is -as
gradual as is that of the climatic conditions, the paleness beginning
near the eastern border of the Great Plains and increasing westward,
reaching its extreme phase in the arid wastes of the almost wholly
rainless districts of the far Southwest—south Nevada, Arizona, and
the contiguous region westward and southward. In respect to this
part of the subject it is hardly necessary to say more than that the
representatives of continental species found here are uniformly much
paler than those inhabiting the adjoining regions; that in many
cases the paler forms were originally described as distinct species,
and are commonly recognized as varietally distinct, though found
{o inseparably intergrade with the neighboring darker forms. In
addition to the general paleness there is often an incréase in the areas
of white and in some cases an accession of new ones.

The wooded, mountainous districts embraced in this region also
give rise to peculiar local phases of color variation, to give a detailed
account of which would too greatly extend the present paper. The
tendency is mainly toward the development of more or less well-
marked rufous or fulvous phases of coloration, with sometimes an
accession of red, while not a few species have more than the usual
amount of black. A most striking instance of increase of red at
western localities is seen in the yellow-bellied woodpecker (Sphy-
rapicus varius)* which, in some of its forms, ranges in the breeding
season over the more northern and elevated wooded portions of the
continent. In its eastern form the male has merely the chin, throat,
and crown red, while in the female the red is restricted to the crown.
In rare instances there is a trace also of a narrow red nuchal band.
In the Rocky Mountain form, however, there is always a red nuchal
band, the red on the throat 1s more extended in the male, and a small
area of red appears also on the throat of the female. In the form met
with in the Cascade Range the red begins to spread over contiguous
portions of the plumage, while in the form occurring along the Pacific
coast the red overspreads the whole head, neck, and breast, through
which, however, the markings of the eastern birds can generally be
readily traced. Here we have, at one end of the series, the red con-
fined to a few distinct patches about the head, while at the other it

a@1n 1877 Sphyrapicus varius included S. ruber as one of its Subspecies, now
generally held to be a distinct species.—Author’s note, 1906,
390 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES.

extends over the whole anterior half of the body. Yet the intergra-
dation between the two has been so fully traced that these diverse
forms are now held by competent authorities as merely local races of
a single species.

Another case of the increase of red over the same region is afforded
by the golden-winged and red-shafted woodpeckers (genus Colaptes) ,
in which vellow in the eastern form is replaced by red in the other;
in the middle region of the continent the species being largely repre-
sented by individuals in which are variously combined the special
characteristics of the two forms. In the present case the black cheek
patch of the eastern form is replaced by a red one in the western.
Traces of the characteristics of the western type occasionally appear
in the most eastern representatives of the eastern type, and, con-
versely, features of the eastern bird appear in the most western rep-
resentatives of the western, showing at least their close affinity and
probable community of origin.

The Pacific coast region from California northward is character-
wed by a great accession of color, all the continental species being
here represented by forms much darker even than on the Atlantic
coast. Here the coloration is duller than at the southward, though
perhaps equally strong, the general tendency being to fuscous or
dusky tints. We consequently find among the mammals and birds of
the United States three strongly marked phases of color differentia-
tion among representatives of the same species, characterizing the
three most strongly marked climatal regions—a bright, strongly col-
ored form east of the Great Plains, a pallid form over the dry
central region, and a deeply colored fuscous form over the rainy,
heavily wooded region of the northwest coast. Examples of this
differentiation are afforded by apparently all the species whose habi-
tats extend entirely across the continent, the several local forms being
In some species only more strongly marked than in others. Among
mammals illustrations are afforded by different species of squirrels,
hares, mice, lynxes, deer, etc., and among birds by six or eight
species of sparrows, a number of woodpeckers, several flycatchers,
thrushes, and warblers, the meadow lark, various hawks, owls, ete.
Generally these several geographical forms were originally described
as dstinct species, and many of them are still thought worthy of
recognition by varietal names. As intermediate links began to be
discovered they were at first looked upon as the result of hybrid-
ity between the supposed distinct species whose characters they
respectively combined, but eventually such links were found to be
too frequent and too general over the areas where the habitats
of the several forms come together to render such a supposition
longer tenable, it finally appearing evident that they were only
the connecting forms between merely local races or incipient species.

PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 391

The local races of any given region, as compared collectively with
those of contiguous regions and the manner of their mutual intergra-
dation, point plainly to some general or widely acting cause of differ-
entiation. This is indicated by the constancy of the results, so many
species, belonging to numerous and widely distinct groups, being simi-
larly affected. Will the fortuitous, spontaneous results of natural
selection yield a satisfactory explanation of these phenomena, or must
we seek some more uniform and definitely acting cause? To briefly
summarize the results above detailed, we have a somewhat uniform
increase of size in some given direction, affecting- many species
simultaneously and similarly over the same areas. We have a fre-
quent enlargement of peripheral parts, affecting not a few, but many,
species, and all in a similar manner, though in varying degrees. We
have a very general increase in the depth or intensity of colors south-
ward, a general loss of color in approaching the central arid portions
of the continent, and again an excessive increment of color under
still different climatic conditions and over a different area. We find
the increase of size among the individuals of any given species to be
quite uniformly in the direction of the center of distribution of the
group to which the species belongs, this being especially well marked
in mammals. We find the increase in the size of peripheral parts, as
the external ear and the length of the pelage in mammals and the
size of the bill and length of the tail in birds, to be in the direction
ef the regions where these parts meet, respectively, their greatest
development—the increase 1n color (especially among birds) toward
ihe region where are developed the richest and most lustrous tints;
the loss of color in the direction of the region where the greatest
general pallor prevails.

We find again that the enlargement of peripheral parts correlates
with increase of temperature; the southward increase of color with
an increase of atmospheric humidity and temperature, and conse-
quently with the protective influences of Juxuriant arboreal vegeta-
tion and clouds: and, conversely, the loss of color accompanying
excessive aridity, a scanty vegetation, and an almost cloudless sky,
ihe conditions, in short, of all others the most. powerfully effective in
the blanching of color; and again, the somber, dusky, tints of the
northwest coast accompanying the most humid conditions of climate
and the conditions generally most favorable for the protection or
preservation of color. Are these merely accidental coincidences, or
are they the evident results of cause and effect? Because the white
winter livery of some of the northern species is more protective
against cold than darker tints would be, or aids in concealing them in
some cases (as in the hares and ptarmigans) from their enemies, or
in other cases (as in the ermines and the arctic fox) tends to aid
them in stealing unperceived upon their prey, are they to be regarded
392 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES.

as unquestionably the beneficial results of the working of natural
selection? Because the dull gray tints of species inhabiting the
semiarid regions of the interior harmonize well with the general
eray aspect of their surroundings, is this concordance the result again
of the operation of the law of natural selection, the less favorably
colored having been weeded out in the struggle for existence? Are
the heavy, dull colors of the humid region of the Northwest the re-
sult, again, of the necessary influence of natural selection in perpetu-
ating only the individuals whose colors best accord with their som-
ber conditions of environment? Has the same action brought about
the bright, rich coloration of birds, msects, and other animals under
the warm, humid conditions of the hotter parts of the earth, preserv-
ing the ratio of brilliancy of coloration with that of the conditions
that everywhere most favor such differentiation? Finally, is the
exact correlation of the changes in coloration with the gradual!
change of climatic conditions in passing from one geographical
region to another the result in like manner of the long-continued
weeding out of the less favored? Or are these modifications sever-
ally due to the direct action of the conditions of environment ?

In answering these questions it may be well to glance first at the
nature of the theoretical origin of differentiation through the influ-
ence of natural selection as expounded by the leading advocates of
the theory. As is well known, all the individuals of a species found
at the same locality (differences resulting from sex and age aside)
are not ail cast in the same mold, but differ constantly, the average
range of purely individual variation in general size and in the size
of different parts ranging (in birds and mammals) from 8 to 15 or
20 per cent of the average size for the species, with a corresponding
amount of variation in color. These variations are found to tend
in every conceivable direction, and it of course follows that some of
them must be in directions exceptionally favorable to the species.
The theory of modification by the action of natural selection -only
supposes that the stronger or otherwise more favored individuals
transmit their favorable qualities to their offspring, and that the
latter, in consequence of their inherited advantages, multiply more
rapidly than their less favored relatives; that these favorable devia-
tions from the parental stock become in subsequent generations more
pronounced, and that the original form is eventually overpowered
and supplanted by its modified descendants. From the same origi-
nal stock may be conceived to arise, even simultaneously, other forms
diverging in different, though still favorable, directions, these in
turn giving rise to several lines of descent, occupying perhaps dif-
ferent portions of the habitat of the original species, where they also
multiply and become dominant, and eventually pass on from the
stage of incipient species to more or less widely differentiated types.
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 3938

These premises being admitted—and they are certainly within the
bounds of reasonable conception—only the element of time appar-
ently is requisite for the.development of an endless variety of un-
stable forms, constantly increasing in number and following diver-
gent lines of development, and thus capable apparently of giving
rise to all the diversity of organisms at present peopling the earth.

But there are many adverse circumstances with which the favored
forms have in the outset to contend and to which in the majority of
instances they must succumb. These are, first, the minuteness of the
first favorable divergence, the isolation of the individuals in which it
appears, and consequently the impossibility of such individuals pair-
ing with others similarly favored, and the consequent tendency of
the offspring to possess the favorable characters in a less rather than
in a greater degree than the parent, and to be absorbed into the origi-
nal stock. Secondly, in case the incipient advantages are perpetu-
ated, as it is necessary to suppose, the new offshoot must originate
from a single point and spread thence gradually to contiguous re-
gions as its representatives slowly multiply.

But it is supposed, again, that new forms are not always thus
gradually evolved from minute beginnings, but sometimes—perhaps
not infrequently—arise by a saltus; that individuals may be born
widely different from their parents, differing so widely and persist-
ently as not to be so readily absorbed by the parental stock. In proof
of this instances are cited of new species apparently appearing sud-
denly and of varieties thus originating under artificial conditions
resulting from domestication. Granting that new forms may thus
arise, although as yet few facts have been adduced in its support,
they are necessarily at first local and in no way accord with the ob-
served geographical differences that characterize particular regions
and which affect similarly many species belonging to widely different

groups.

The direct influence of climatic or geographical conditions upon
animals is, in the main, ignored by the leading exponents of the doc-
trine of natural selection. To quote Mr. Darwin’s own words on this
point :

The action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the strug-
gle for existence; but, in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it
brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the
same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food. Even when
Climate—for instance, extreme cold—acts directly, it will be the least vigor-
ous, or those which have got the least food through the advancing winter, which
will suffer most. When we travel from south to north or from a damp region
toa dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer and
finally disappearing, and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are
tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But this is a false

sm 1905——29
394 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES.

view; we forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly
suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life from enemies or from
competitors for the same place and food, and, if these enemies or competitors
be in the least degree favored by any slight change of climate, they will increase
in numbers, and, as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the
other species will decrease. When we travel southward and see a species de-
creasing in numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in
other species being favored as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel
northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all
kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northward; hence in going
northward or in ascending a mountain we far oftener meet with stunted forms
due to the directly injurious action of climate than we do in proceeding south-
ward or in descending a mountain. When we reach the Arctic regions or snow-
capped summits or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively
with the elements. That climate acts in main part indirectly by favoring other
species we may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens
which can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become natural-
ized, for they can not compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by
our native animals.¢

While there is perhaps little reason to question the general correct-
ness of the above-quoted generalizations, they have little bearmg
upon the question of the modification of species by the direct action
of climatic conditions, but relate mainly to such unfavorable climatic
influences as tend toward the extinction of species or to the circum-
scription of their ranges. Indeed, the phenomena of variation de-
tailed in the foregoing pages were almost wholly unknown at the
time the earlier editions of the Origin of Species were published, and
have hardly as yet become the common property of naturalists.
Gradual decrease in size southward in hundreds of species inhabiting
the same continent, or a gradual increase or decrease in color in given
directions on a similarly grand scale, are facts but recently made
known, and have not as yet been very fully discussed by evolutionists
of.the purely Darwinian school. Mr. Darwin, indeed, in referring
to the “ effects of changed conditions ” upon animals, alludes to facts
of a similar character—as the alleged brighter colors of Kuropean
shells near their southern limit of distribution and when living in
shallow water, and the more somber tints of birds that live on islands
or near the coast under overcast skies as compared with those of the
same species living more in the interior, etc.—but is in doubt as to
how much should be attributed even in such cases “ to the accumula-
tive action of natural selection and how much to the definite action
of the conditions of life.” “ Thus,” he says, “it is well known to
furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur
the farther north they live; but who can tell how much of this dif-
ference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having been favy-
ored and preserved during many generations and how much to the

PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 395

action of the severe climate? For it would appear that climate has
some direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.”* Since,
however, it happens that some species do not vary at all, although
living under the most opposite climates, he is thereby inclined “ not
to lay much weight on the direct and definite action of the conditions
of life,” though he fully admits “ that strong arguments of a general
nature may be advanced on the other side.” ‘ In one sense,” he adds,
“the conditions of life may be said not only to cause variability, but
hkewise to include natural selection, for the conditions determine
whether this or that variety shall survive.”’ But he says again: “ I
believe that natural selection generally acts slowly in effecting
changes at long intervals of time and only on a few of the inhabitants
of the same region.” Ina later work, however, he refers to the vari-
ation in color with locality seen in many species of birds in the
United States, and says explicitly, in reference to northern and
southern localities, “ this seems to be the direct result of the difference
in temperature, light, ete., between the two regions.” ¢

There is, however, a vast amount of unquestionable proof of the
direct and constant action of climate and other conditions of life
upon animals, and that such geographical variations as the thicker
and softer fur of mammals inhabiting cold regions, smaller size and
brighter colors at the southward, ete., do not require the action
of natural selection, in its strict and proper sense, for their explana-
tion. It is well known, for instance, that a flock of fine-wooled sheep
when taken to a hot climate rapidly acquire a coarser and coarser
fleece, till, in a few generations, it nearly loses its character of proper
wool, and becomes simply hair; that the change affects simultaneously
the whole flock, and is not brought about by one or two individuals
acquiring a coarser fleece and through their descendants modifying
the character of the herd. Furthermore, in the case of sheep, it is
well known that certain countries are very favorable to the production
of a fine fleece, and that fine-wooled breeds, even by man’s aid, can
not be perpetuated in other regions. Again, it is a fact of common
observation that in birds and mammals colors become more or less
faded toward the moulting season simply by the direct action of the
elements, the tints of the fresh and the long-worn plumage or
pelage being more or less strikingly different in the same individ-
uals, and that this contrast at different seasons is more marked in
arid than in moist regions, through the greater bleaching effect of a
dry heated atmosphere and the more intense dazzling sunlight of
regions that are not only cloudless, but lack the protection afforded
by abundant vegetation.

396 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES.

While so much is claimed by the writer as due to the direct action
of climatic causes, it is admitted also that habits and food and other
conditions of life than those resulting from climate have a marked
effect in determining modifications of form and color among animals. +
A searcity of a favorite kind of food will undoubtedly force species
to subsist upon the next best that offers, which may be so different as
to modify certain characters and fit the species to live upon the less
desired food. A change of food may lead to modification of denti-
tion, the muscles of mastication, and the organs of digestion and,
correlatively, of other organs or parts of the body; the modification,
however, arising simultaneously among all the descendants of the in-
dividuals thus driven to a change of diet, instead of appearing first in
a single individual and becoming perpetuated in its descendants alone.
Entomologists have found that, among insects of the same species,
the forced or voluntary use of different food plants gives rise to modi-
fications of color and structure, and hence result in what have been
termed phytophagic varieties or subspecies, and that man can also
effect such changes at will by simply changing the food of the species.
Again, the geological character of a country is well known to have a
marked effect upon the size and@color of animals inhabiting it, as is
strikingly illustrated among molluscous animals, whose abundance,
and even presence, is largely dependent upon the constituents of the
soil. Over regions of the United States, for example, where the un-
derlying rock is noncalcareous the species are both few in number
and sparsely represented, while in other regions, where limestone
abounds but which are in other respects essentially the same, the
species are far more numerous and far more abundantly represented.
Tn respect to the fresh-water mussels, those of the same species from
different streams are easily distinguishable by differences in the thick-
ness of the shell, in color, shape, and ornamentation, so that the
character of the shells themselves affords a clew to the locality of their
origin. At some localities the species tend to become tuberculous
or spinous, this being particularly the case toward the southward; at
other localities they acquire a very much thickened shell, or different
colors, the same characteristics appearing simultaneously in quite
diverse species, and thus becoming distinctive of particular localities.
In regard to mammals, measurements of large series of the skulls of
minks, martens, squirrels, and other native species show that the
representatives of these species living in northern New England and
northeastern New York are smaller than the representatives of the
same species occurring in the limestone districts of Pennsylvania and
the States more to the westward, and the same is true of the different
kinds of domestic cattle. This is in opposition to the law of decrease
in size southward that elsewhere and generally characterizes these
same species, and seems obviously related to the geological character
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 397

of the country at these localities; small size, in opposition to a general
law, occurring over northern noncaleareous districts, and larger size
more to the southward, where the underlying rock is limestone. In
this case the difference obviously results from the direct action of the
conditions of habitat upon every individual rather than from “ slowly
effected changes ” originating in “ only a few of the inhabitants ” of
these respective districts.

Use and disuse of organs, through changes of habit resulting from
changed conditions of environment, must result i some modification
of the organ involved. As an example may doubtless be cited the
passerine birds of some of the smaller, remotely situated islands, as
the Guadeloupe and Galapagos groups, where recent investigations
have shown that most of the species differ similarly in several features
from their nearest alles of the mainland, and of which they are
unquestionably insular forms. These differences consist in the
greater size of the bill, shorter wings, longer tails, and darker colors.
The sedentary hfe necessitated by the confined habitats of species
thus situated would naturally act more or less strongly on the organs
of flight, and a reduction in the size of the wing would follow, not
necessarily through the roundabout process of natural selection,
through the modification originally of a single individual, but by the
direct action on all the individuals alike of the changed conditions of
life.

It is doubtless unnecessary to further multiply examples of the
modification of animals by the direct action of the conditions of life.
The subject is one that can be but imperfectly treated at best in a
short paper like the present. The illustrations have here been drawn
from a limited geographical field and mainly from among the two
nigher classes of vertebrates. There are, however, abundant indica-
tions that other fields and other classes would yield results equally
confirmatory of the direct action of physical conditions in the evolu-
tion of specific forms among animals and plants. Changes in en-
vironing conditions will, however, go but a short way toward explain-
ing the origin of the great diversity of structure among existing
organisms; the character of the food, habit, or the increased use or the
disuse of particular organs may explain many of the modifications,
Jeaving a large share of the work to as yet unknown causes. Natural
selection, as sometimes defined, is made to cover all causes of dif-
ferentiation, it being stated by Mr. Darwin himself that if organic
beings undergo modification through changes in their conditions of
life “ uniformity of character can be given to their modified offspring
solely by natural selection preserving similar favorable variations.”
Tn its strict sense, variation by natural selection results only through
favorable differences appearing at first in single isolated individuals,
which transmit these favorable qualities to their offspring, in virtue
398 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES.

of which they multiply till they outnumber, crowd out, and finally
destroy the less-favored form from which they originated.

It is hardly conceivable, for example, how the peculiar structure
seen in the woodpecker, the kingfisher, the swift, the heron, or the
duck, or the peculiar dentition and correlated characters of the
rodents, the ruminants, or the shrews and moles, as compared with
the Carnivora, can have been initiated by the direct action of climatic
conditions, however much other conditions of environment may have
favored the development of these diverse types.

Having thus far mainly detailed merely facts and coincidences
relating to the subject of variation with locality, it may be well in
conclusion to consider. more fully some of the possible or probable
causes of purely geographical variation. In regard to geographical
variation in color, it seems evident that high temperature, conjoined
with moisture, favors increase of color, and especially the acquisition
of lustrous tints, while moisture alone favors simply increase in depth
or the production of dull, heavy, and especially fuscous phases of
coloration; on the other hand, that aridity and exposure favor the
loss of color. The latter is due apparently no less to the influence of a
dry and often intensely heated atmosphere than to the direct action
of light intensified by the reflection of the sun’s rays from almost
verdureless sands. That the latter conditions act powerfully in
blanching color there is most abundant proof. Hence we have the
necessary correlation of increase of bright rich tints of coloration
with the increase of atmospheric humidity. In respect to the enlarge-
ment of peripheral parts at the southward, it is obvious that a high
temperature favors the more rapid circulation of the blood in these
parts, while, as is well known, a low temperature produces the oppo-
site effect and necessarily retards their development.

With the decrease in size among birds, there has been observed a
decrease of vivacity and deterioration of song, which may reasonably
be attributed to the enervating influence of a high temperature.
Since the northern types of animals reach their highest physical
development toward the northward, it seems fair to suppose that
decrease in size southward may be directly due to the enfeebling
influences of increase of temperature, since certainly it can not be
attributed, in the majority of cases at least, to greater scarcity of
food, for in many instances just the reverse obtains. This supposi-
tion is in accordance with the known effects of similar climatic con-
ditions upon the northern races of man, which reach their greatest
vigor and highest intellectual status under temperate conditions of
climate, and deteriorate, both physically and mentally, on removing
to intertropical regions. Again, the mammals and birds of the
United States reach their maximum size within the United States
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 399

under the stimulating climate of the region drained by the upper
Mississipp1 and upper Missouri rivers, being, as a rule, larger here
than in corresponding latitudes more to the eastward. The decrease
in size toward both the northern and southern borders of the habitat
of a given species or genus, of which there are many marked in-
stances, further shows that size varies with the varying conditions
of habitat and reaches the maximum only where the conditions are
most favorable to the life of the species.

Much has been written respecting the influence of climate on man,
and many speculations have been indulged in in relation to the part
the conditions of life have taken in bringing about the diversity at
present existing among the different races. A striking parallelism
is often observable between the leading features of geographical
variation among animals and the physical differences that obtain
among nations or races of men inhabiting the same areas and sub-
jected to the same influences. While civilized man is, in a measure,
‘less the subject of such influences than the lower animals, he is not
wholly above them. Certain regions more favor both physical and
intellectual development than others, and these prove to be, as would
be expected, the milder temperate portions of the globe, where the
struggle for a mere vegetative existence is reduced to a minimum.

The influence of different climatic conditions upon members of the
same nationality find exemplification in different parts of our own
country, and are so obvious as to be the subject of frequent obser-
ration and comment. The same original stock is found to gradually
develop certain peculiar physical and mental characteristics when
placed under diverse conditions of climate, certain localities more fa-
voring intellectual growth and activity than others, just as certain
regions are characterized by the frequent occurrence of particular dis-
eases which in other regions are exceptional. While humidity and a
high temperature, when combined, are found to be enervating and de-
teriorating, a clear, dry atmosphere favors vigor of both mind and
body. But the subject of the influence of climatic conditions upon
man is too vast to be entered upon in detail in the present connection.
The study of man from a geographical standpoint, or with special ref-
erence to conditions of environment, offers a most important and fruit-
ful field of research, which, it is to be hoped, will soon receive a more
eareful attention than has as yet been given it.

In conclusion, a few words seem called for concerning the ques-
tion, What is a species? as well as in respect to the bearing of the
general facts above detailed upon the evolution of specific forms.

As is well known, the belief that species were distinct and immut-
able creations was long the prevailing one among naturalists. Yet
the question of what constitutes a species is one about which endless
400 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES.

discussions have arisen, and one respecting which the most discordant
opinions have been held by naturalists equally eminent in their re-
spective fields of research. The amount and kind of difference neces-
sary to characterize a species has been variously defined; forms that
some have considered as specific others have regarded as merely varie-
ties, and the reverse. In certain groups of organisms intermediate
forms have been constantly met with, constituting steps of easy inter-
gradation between quite diverse types. Such forms have been and still
are held by some writers as varieties of a single species and by others
as constituting a group (genus or subgenus) of distinct but nearly
related species. Through the frequent discovery of such intergrada-
tions, however, the instability of so-called * species ” has been made
manifest and the contrary doctrine of the stability or fixity of species
refuted. Indeed, naturalists now generally agree that the terms
“variety,” “ genus,’ “subgenus,” “family,” “subfamily,”
“superfamily,” and the lke, are but conventional and more or
less arbitrary designations for different degrees of differentiation—
convenient formule for the expression of general facts in biology.
Not a few high authorities even maintain that the differences which
characterize these several groups are of the same nature, differing

ve we oe

species,”

only in degree, in opposition to others who hold that they are based
on different categories of structure, or on differences of Avid rather
than of degree. The falsity of the latter view is shown more and
more clearly with the increase of our knowledge of the structure and
affinities of animals.

While formerly species were considered as necessarily characterized
either by differences of a particular kind, or by a certain amount of
difference, the present tendency is to regard neither as a sufiicient
eriterion, the test of specific diversity being merely absence of inter-
gradation, in other words, breaks in the continuity of closely alhed
beings. Local races, or geographical forms, are thrown together
under one specific designation whenever they are found to intergrade,
however diverse may be their extreme phases of differentiation. The
term species 1s now made to cover groups which were, not many years
since, frequently regarded as subgenera, or even genera, the forms

oe

then supposed, in numberless instances, to be “ good species,” now
ranking merely as subspecies. The reduction in the number of
species has necessarily entailed a considerable reduction in the number
of currently accepted genera, which in turn are limited by hiati rather
than by any given amount or particular kind of difference. It was
formerly urged against the theory of evolution that its advocates
could point to no instance of the gradual change of one species into
another, and that, until this was done, the theory was untenable.
Among the species of North American vertebrates recognized as valid
PHYSICAL CONDITIONS IN GENESIS OF SPECIES. 401

ten years ago, hundreds of instances can now be cited of thoroughly
proven intergradation, forms then regarded as unquestionable species
being found to be but connected phases of one and the same specific
type, which assumes, at remote localities, under the evident action of
climatic agencies, phases widely diverse, which gradually merge the
one into the other through the individuals inhabiting the intervening
districts. So long as species are based on the absence of intergrada-
tion, and biologists have found no other satisfactory criterion for
their limitation, there can of course be no passage of one species into
another. Let, however, some of the connecting links become extinct,
‘and these now intergrading forms would be resolved into distinet
species. In this way insular and other local forms are passing beyond
the so-called varietal stage, and species are similarly tending to gen-
eric distinctness. That varieties may and do arise by the action of
climatie influences, and pass on to become species, and that species
become, in like manner, differentiated into genera, is abundantly indi-
cated by the facts of geographical distribution and the obvious rela-
tion of local forms to the conditions of environment. The present
more or less unstable condition of the circumstances surrounding
organic beings, together with the known mutations of climate our
planet has undergone in past geological ages, points clearly to the
agency of physical conditions as one of the chief factors in the evolu-
tion of new forms of life. So long as the environing conditions re-
main stable, just so long will permanency of character be maintained ;
but let changes occur, however gradual or minute, and differentiation
begins. If too sudden or too great, extinction of many forms must
result, giving rise to breaks in the chain of genetically connected
organisms. In the deep abysses of the sea, where the temperature is
low and stable, where the conditions of life must have remained al-
most unvaried since the early geological periods, the same low organ-
isms still exist that were the prevailing forms of life when life first:
dawned upon the earth. The recent explorations of the depths of the
sea have gone far to prove that stability of organic forms is in
direct ratio to the stability of the conditions of existence, while the
facts of geographical distribution show that change of structure and
diversity of life are directly related to the physical conditions of
habitat.

Nore.—During the twenty-nine years that have passed since the original pub-
lication of this article great advances haye been made in our knowledge of the
mammals and birds of North America, to which this paper primarily relates.
Nearly every part of the continent has since been explored in great detail by
well-trained collectors, employing new methods and greatly improved devices,
especially for the capture of the smaller rodents and insectivores, which in

the earlier days proved so elusive. With the consequent immense increase of
material, of much better quality and from innumerable localities, the point of
view in regard to species and subspecies has greatly changed, resulting in
changes of nomenclature. Aside from the technical names there is little in
the article that I should modify were it to be now rewritten. All that it con-
tains concerning geographic and climatic variation, and the influence of physical
conditions in the genesis of species and subspecies, is still satisfactory. In the
present reprint, the only changes found really desirable consist in the correc-
tion of a few typographical errors, and modifications here and there of technical
names, to bring them more nearly in harmony with present nomenclature.
These changes are for the most made in footnotes or by words inserted in
brackets.

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.
By THroporE GILL.

The belief long prevailed that fishes are indifferent to their eggs
and young and leave them entirely to the care of Mother Nature.
One who was more excellent as a man of letters than as a naturalist,
but who wrote, nevertheless, a very readable work on Animated
Nature, expressed the general belief once dominant. Oliver Gold-
smith, in 1774, told his readers that “ fishes seem, a// except the whale
kind, entirely divested of those parental solicitudes which so strongly
mark the manners of the more perfect terrestrial animals.”¢ Many
to the present time entertain that belief.

More than a score of centuries before Goldsmith, however, the
greatest naturalist of antiquity, Aristotle, told of a kind of fish,
inhabiting the largest river of Greece, the Macedonian Achelous,
which, in the person of the male parent, exerted the greatest care of
both eggs and young. That account, however, was overlooked or
neglected, and even regarded with skepticism and as fabulous. The
‘strange history of that fish—known to Aristotle as the glanis—will
be told at length in later pages of this article. Its truthfulness has
been vouched for, not by later observers of itself, but by studies of
related fishes having analogous habits in a quarter of the world
unknown to and undreamed of by Aristotle. Although the most
detailed history of any fish by any ancient writer is connected with
it in the philosopher’s History of Animals (lept C@@yv toropias
Aifrra), no reference to it appears in any modern popular work.

Many important details respecting the life histories and parental
care of a large number of other fishes have been published from time
to time and may be found in the publications of various societies or

a@Many years before Goldsmith wrote, Linnzeus (1758) had recognized the
impassible gap between true fishes and cetaceans and combined the latter
and the viviparous hairy quadrupeds in the class of mammals, but Goldsmith
urged that, “Although all our modern naturalists have fairly excluded them
from the finny tribes, and will have them called, not fishes, but great beasts of
the ocean,” “ yet, notwithstanding philosophers, mankind will always have their
owh way of talking; and for my part,’ continues Goldsmith, “ I think them here
in the right.” This thought indicates how little of a naturalist Goldsmith really
was.

other periodicals, but such are closed books to most persons. Any-
one who looks for information in the popular works on natural his-
tory of the day must inevitably be disappointed at the meagerness
of the information given. Even in the voluminous German work,
so well known as Brehm’s Tierleben, the information is meager for
almost all fishes, and especially meager for American forms. The
sources of knowledge have not been discovered by the compilers of
such works, but he who might judge from the paucity of data that
no others could be found would be much deceived. To uncover some
of the interesting details hidden in comparatively little known journals
and other works is the object of the present article, which is devoted to
the record of facts about the mating and breeding habits of some among
many remarkable species. It is hoped that the information given may
indicate points to be observed in the history and economy of other
species, as well as of those already noticed. There is, indeed, an ur-
gent call for corroboration and amplification of most of the his-
" tories given, as well as for discovery of the hatural history of other
species.

The species which manifest care for their young are so numerous
that the present article must be restricted to those which are inhabit-
ants of fresh water. Such are better known than the marine forms,
as they are more easily observed and within the range of observation
of a more numerous population. Considerable is known, however,
of the habits of many of the dwellers in salt water. Parental care
has been especially observed in the marine pipefishes, sea-horses,
Pegasids, Solenostomids, Sparids (e. g., Catharus), Labrids (Wras-
ses), toad fishes, gobies, blennies, sculpins or Codttids, lumpfishes,
Gobiesocids, ete. Doubtless analogous care will be found to be exer-
cised by many more when fishes shall have been more thoroughly
studied.

Naturally the most common or frequent mode of care is the sim-
plest, consisting of little more than selection of a site for the deposit
of the female’s eggs and subsequent guardianship of those eggs by
the male. The concomitants of such selection are various. In the
case of the American sunfishes, black basses, and crappies, the place
selected is cleared of stones and weeds, and in the cleared places the
eggs are laid. Some of the sunfish-hke Cichlids and the North
American catfishes, as well as the Grecian glanis, exercise similar
means with sheght modifications. Another kind of catfish, living in
North Australia (Queensland), lays her eggs in the center of a se-
lected area of a river bed, and, after having fertilized them, the fish
accumulates stones from the surrounding area and piles them in a
heap over the eggs. Other modifications of a general plan appear
to be executed by other fishes, but the details remain to be investi-
gated.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 405

Oral gestation or carriage of eggs within the mouth of the parent
fish is practiced in a number of unrelated species. In Siluroid cat-
fishes it 1s associated with enlarged size of the eggs, as in most Tachi-
surines and one of the Pimelodines (Conorhynchos), and is confined
to the males. ‘Phe Malapteruroid, or electric catfish, is also said to be
an oral egg carrier. In other fishes the eggs of the egg carriers are
not essentially different from those of normal habits, and many
related species do not have the peculiarity. Such egg carriers are

Niehlids of America (Geophagus) and of Africa (Tilapia, Tropheus,
Ectodus, ete.), as well as species of the marine genus Uhilodipterus,
one of the Apogonids.

It is especially noteworthy that among the Cichlids are exceptions
1o the rule that the care taker is a male. In several cases it has been
verified that the egg carrier is a female and presumably, of course,
the layer of the eggs. From evidence so far accumulated it would
seem that the sex of the care taker is coincident with specific char-
acters, and that when the care taker is a female the male is not. At
least, in a recent article (L’incubation buccale chez le Tilapia galilaea
Artedi, 1904), J. Pellegrin showed that all four individuals of the
species examined which had eggs in the mouth were females, and he
could find no male egg carriers. Boulenger previously had found
eggs in the mouths of females only of Tilapia nilotica and other
Cichlids of the genera 'ctodus, Tropheus, and Pelmatochromis. On
the other hand, the sex of the egg@ carrier of Tilapia philander was
determined by so competent an authority as A. Giinther to be male.
Further, Lortet named a Cichlid 77lapia paterfamilias, which was
declared by Pellegrin to be specifically identical with Zlapia
simonis. Wortet gave his name, because he considered the egg carrier
to be the male, while Pellegrin confirmed, by dissection, the sex of a
specimen of the same species to be female. Evidently, then, there is
necessity for further observations as to the sex of the egg carriers of
African, as well as the American, Cichlids.”

aThe eggs of some of the ovigerous Cichlids are very large. According to
Boulenger (T. Z. S., XV, 18), ‘the mouth and pharynx of” a female Tropheus
moorii contained ‘four eggs of very large size, the vitelline sphere measuring
4 millimetres in diameter, with an embryo in an advanced stage of devyelop-
ment. The eggs of: the fifteen-spined Stickeback, hitherto regarded as the
largest Teleostean egg in proportion to the size of the animal, measures only
3 millimetres in diameter.” The egg-carrying Tropheus was only about 4 inches
long.

bThe above remarks are left just as they were printed, but on the same
day as the proof of this article was received from the printing office a “ Fourth
Contribution to the Ichthyology of Lake Tanganyika,’ by G. A. Boulenger,
fresh from the press, was also received, containing the much-needed “ further
observations.” Doctor Boulenger records that Doctor Cunnington, the latest
explorer of the ichthyology of the lake, had been “so fortunate as to con-
siderably extend the list of Cichlid fishes in which the parents protect their
406 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

One of the most singular devices for protection of the eggs is the
formation of bubbles of air rendered tenacious by a viscous secre-
tion of the mouth. ‘This might seem to be so specialized a method
that there would be no independent repetition by representatives of
a very different group. In fact, however, the method, or an analo-
gous one, has originated anew time and time again. It is manifest,
so far as known, in its simplest form in the fish-of-paradise (J/acro-
podus viridi-auratus), which makes a floating nest of a mere con-
glomeration of bubbles, but other species of the same family (Osphro-
menids) evolve nidamenta!l receptacles little more complicated, and
«among them is the celebrated Gourami. The nests earliest described,
in which air bubbles formed an essential element, were those of
Hlassars (Callichthyids of the genus Hoplosternum), but in them
the air or “ froth ” was used in combination with vegetable material
(“fallen leaves or grass”). The large floating nest of the African
Gymnarchus, recently described by .Budgett, may, perhaps, be partly
buoyed up by aeriform secretions. The future investigation of the
structures involved in the secretion of such bubbles will undoubtedly
yield most interesting results.

More specialized than any of the methods of parental care herein-
before noticed is one manifested by certain American fishes. Those
fishes are of a family named Aspredinids, peculiar to the fresh
waters of South America and distantly—and very distantly—related
to the catfishes of the north. In them it is the female that assumes
charge of the eggs, and she does it in a strange and truly character-
istic manner. After the eges have been discharged from the ovaries
(and presumably after they have been fertilized), the mother presses
her belly and breast over them and they become attached thereto;
then the areas of attachment of the skin become elevated into cupules
round the eggs, like the cups of acorns round the nuts, and not only
so, but strangulation ensues between each cupule and the general
skin of the belly, so that the eggs and cupules are borne upon stalks
or peduncles, and so they remain till the eggs are hatched and the

offspring by giving them shelter in the mouth and pharynx. This mode of
nursing is illustrated” by examples of seven additional species of six genera.
“The natives” round the lake “say it is always the female, in the cases where
one of the parents takes the eggs in the mouth,” that ‘is the carrier. This
belief has now been confirmed by Boulenger for no less than ten African
genera; in fact, whenever he had been able to test the sex of the egg carrier
it was “invariably the female who thus carries the eggs. This was in con-
tradiction to statements made by Lortet and by Gtinther, who ascribed the
habit to the male in the species of the same genus with which they had dealt.”
Of course it is easy enough to tell by dissection whether a fish is a male or a
female, and the authors in question probably neglected to take the proper
means to ascertain the sex, but took it for granted that the nurse was a male.
See for further data the paragraphs on the Cichlids hereafter.—October 25,

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 407

embryos leave, after which the skin returns to its former condition.
The only analogue to this occurs in certain anurous batrachians, but
in such in a less specialized condition and on the back.

The most specialized of all the care takers are the sticklebacks, or
Gasterosteids. These have an important organ (the kidney and its
adjuncts) especially modified histologically to yield a thread analo-
gous to that developed by spiders and used for binding the objects
selected for a nest. So far as known none of the related fishes has
the same structural peculiarity, but it is quite possible, if not prob-
able, that their nearest relatives of the North Pacific—the Aulo-
thynchids—may have a similar history. It is scarcely within the
range of possibility that an analogous structure like this should have
been independently developed a second time in unrelated fishes.

One remarkable, and to some astonishing, fact is the want of corre-
lation that may sometimes exist within a natural family between
structural features and habits. This is strikingly manifest in the
typical catfishes or Silurids. Neither of the parents of the well-
known wels of central and western Europe appears to care for eggs
or young, but the male of its near relation of Macedonia—the
gianis—assumes a special charge of his consort’s labor. Opposite
ways of making their nests are practiced by the North American cat-
fishes on one hand and certain Australian ones on the other. En-
largement of the eggs is manifested in another group and is associated
with their reception and carriage by the male in his mouth.

In the last English work on fishes, the Cambridge Natural His-
tory, it is declared that, ‘“ with the exception of the pelagic Anten-
narius, which builds its nest in the sargasso weed in mid-ocean,
nest building and parental solicitude for the young are confined to
fresh water fishes and to marine forms with demersal eggs. Pelagic
ova must necessarily be beyond the scope of parental care.” The
so-called Antennarius is no exception; the species meant is not a
true Antennarius, but belongs to a distinct though related genus—
Pterophryne. Its history is a truly remarkable one and it has been
more widely noticed as a nest-building fish than any other except
the Gasterosteids. In truth, however, it does not build a nest at all.
The whole story is the result of a misidentification of the eggs of a
fish. In 1872, the celebrated naturalist, Prof. Louis Agassiz, attrib-
uted egg-bearing masses of gulf weed (sargassum), which he found
in the gulf stream, to the Pferophryne which was abundantly asso-
ciated with them. His equally able son, Dr. Alexander Agassiz,
a decade later (1882), made known the remarkable egg raft which
floated the eggs of a relative of the Pterophryne—the angler
(Lophius piscatorius). This discovery may have led to thought, but

¢Cambridge Natural History, Vol. VII, p. 414 (1904).
408 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

did not discredit the earlier identification.* In 1905, however, Dr.
EK. W. Gudger and Dr. Hugh Smith both caught females of Ptero-
phryne in the act of emission of egg rafts like that of the angler.
Of course the parent of such eggs and egg rafts could not be the maker
of the nests attributed to the Pterophryne. What fish, then, was the
maker of the nests? The only eggs like those found in the nests
are those of some flying fishes (Exoccetids). We are forced, there-
fore, to assume that a flying fish had laid her eggs on a frond ef the
sargassum, and that they had been fertilized by the male. These
eggs have bipolar bunches of very long filamentary tendrils, and
such have mechanically grasped and brought together the finely
divided branches of the sargassum, with the result that subelobular
masses have been formed in which the eggs are protected. They

answer every purpose of a nest, but are they nests? If so considered
we must admit that the eggs and not the fish make a nest!

Some of the fishes to be noticed in the following pages have the
males gaudily colored and larger than the females. The relations of
the sexes to each other with regard to color and size are noteworthy,
inasmuch as they have been generally misunderstood. One eminent
ichthyologist (Doctor Giinther), in an “ Introduction to the study of
fishes” (p. 656), dogmatically declared that “ with regard to size,
it appears that in a// teleosteous fishes the female is larger than the
male,” and Darwin was assured by him that he did “ not know a sin-

a@As Professor Agassiz did not notice any filaments on his eggs, I thought
it possible that some real eggs of a Pterophryne may have drifted on the out-
side of an egg mass, but Doctor Agassiz kindly sent me a couple of eggs from
the outside and they proved to have bipolar filaments and consequently to
be eggs of flying fishes.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 409

gle instance in which the male is larger than the female.”* Yet in
the very chapter containing this assertion Darwin represents three
species of fishes selected by Giinther in which males are figured of
larger size than females; they are named Callionymus lyra (fig. 29),
Xiphophorus helleri (fig. 80), and Plecostomus barbatus (fig. 31).
These species, be it remarked, have the sexes trenchantly differen-
tiated, the males in two cases being marked by a superior brilliancy
of coloration and exuberance of fins and in the other (Plecostomus) by
a bristly armature of the head. The instances of increased size of
the male are, in fact, numerous; in almost all cases when the males
are decidedly differentiated from the females by brillianey of color
or other secondary characters the rule is that they are larger than the
females. Like other rules, this may be subject to exceptions, but the
rule is based on extensive observations. A couple of figures made

graph of the Loricarioid Catfishes of America and reproduced here
exemplify the rule. Of a kindred species, Pseudancistrus barbatus,
the sexes are illustrated in Darwin’s work.

During the consideration of the social economy of these fishes the
question must often recur, How did the parental instinct manifested
originate? It was easy enough in olden time to give an answer
which would be regarded as all sufficient in those days; it was a spe-
cific instinct implanted by an omnipotent creator in every case. In
these days of evolutionary belief, however, such an answer is equiva-
lent to no answer. The instinct must be regarded as a development
of an aptitude inherent in the fish itself.

410 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

Probably few naturalists or psychologists will be prepared to con-
cede the possession of a sentiment of antiselfish altruism by any of
these lowly forms. The attribute of parental care must therefore be
regarded as an outcome of selfishness, or, if you will, self-love,¢ a re-
sult of the sense of proprietorship. The eggs are the fish’s own, and
therefore they and the resulting larve are to be cared for as such.
Perhaps it may be urged that the attention of the parental fishes is
of the same nature as that of the hen to her young. We are not pre-
pared to deny it. It may even be conceded, and yet the claim that
the sentiment is the offspring of self-love can still be maintained. In
fact, there is a regular gradation of self-love into the ennobled senti-
ment which impels the human mother to sacrifice her hfe cheerfully
for her child and the degraded passion which emboldens the miser to

suffer death rather than lose his gold. It is the basis of the courage
of the farseeing martyr for his religion, for he is willing to sacrifice
the present for an illimitable future.

Wonder may be entertained that one and the same method of care
should have originated independently many times, but this will di-
minish on reflection. When the sense of proprietorship in the eggs
has been established protection by hiding them or clearing away of
foreign substances that would interfere with them would not un-
naturally follow. The mouth is used by many fishes for carrying,
and the instinct to take up the eggs into the mouth for protection
would be a natural consequence which might be, and repeatedly has

been, developed into a habit. These and other provisions for the
rare of the eggs do not make excessive demands on our receptive
capacity or imagination. It is only when we consider the case of the
sticklebacks that the combination of aptitudes for nest making im-
presses us. In them complexity is carried to an extreme. There is
a sympathetic development of the kidneys and the testes; there is the
synchronous response of both to external stimuli; there is the reaction
of both on the brain and of the brain to external conditions; there
is the elaboration of the wonderful thread which is used to bind the
nest materials; there is the instinct to use the thread; there are,
finally, the regular aptitudes and impulses which are shared with the
majority of fishes. Such an accumulation and convergence of struc-
tural, physiological, and psychological characters almost force upon
us a rejection, as explanation, of natural selection or sexual selection.
The development manifested in the Gasterosteids is, indeed, one of
the greatest wonders of the evolution of animal life. Nevertheless,
it may not seem so extraordinary if we extend our researches beyond
the class to which they belong.

Naturally the elaboration for the perpetuation of the species in the
Gasterosteids is unique in the class of fishes, but there is to some
extent an analogous provision, although not so complicated, for the
animal economy in certain other classes, as in the case of the webs
of most spiders and the cocoons of some insects, as notably the silk-
worms. Mollusks and Annelids furnish other illustrations. Of
course in those cases the analogous secretions are not produced by
homologous organs, but by very different ones, very different from
each other as well as from those of the sticklebacks.

As this article is intended to summarize existing knowledge re-
specting the breeding habits of some of the fishes in question, the
original words in which the facts are recorded are given in most
cases—in fact, wherever it could be done without interference with the
mode of treatment or sequence adopted for the narration. The text,
however, is by no means confined to information respecting the nests
and breeding habits. Most of the species are little known or even quite
unknown to many persons and yet are very interesting for other
reasons than their parental instincts. Consequently quite detailed
accounts of their habits in general as well as their places in nature
are added. The illustrations are mostly borrowed and are derived
from various sources, as will be indicated in connection with the
respective figures. Among the original illustrations are those of a
fish longest known—the Glanis of the ancient Greeks, never before
figured.
412 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.
THE DIPNOANS.

Tn and confined to the Southern Hemisphere are three very pecu-
har types of aquatic animal life. One from South America was first
deseribed in 1836 as a reptile related to the siren of the north and
named Lepidosiren,; another, from Africa, not long after (1841), was
made known as a true fish, and on account of its simple and sup-
posedly primitive fashion of limbs styled Protopterus. For a long
time it was a matter of dispute between naturalists whether the two
were reptiles or fishes, and no relationship was recognized between
them and any other forms, recent or fossil. At last, in Australia,
in 1870, was discovered the third type, and then it became evident
that not only had they all relatives in the past, but all their relatives
were of the past, and the very distant past. The most recent of
those extinct forms, so far as known, lived not only in old Europe and
America, but also in Africa, Asia, and Australia. They enjoyed a
world-wide distribution during the Jurassic period and thus early in
geological history disappeared from the surface of the earth. Some,
of course, must have survived to transmit their blood and likeness to

Fic. 6.—Neoceratodus forsteri. After Giinther.

their living relatives, but their fossil remains have not yet been
found. There is an extraordinary gap between the oldest of the
living types (of very late Tertiary age) and the hosts that once
ranged over the globe. The three types are the Lepidosiren of South
America, the Protopterus of Africa, and the Neoceratodus of Austra-
la. They and their distant relative, Polypterus, are immeasurably
the nearest of kin to the stock from which alike fishes and reptiles
originated. Two are remarkable for the provision which they make
for their eggs and young. It is most fitting, therefore, that they
should be the first to illustrate parental care among fishes.

The three genera are now segregated into a group named Dipnoi
or Dipneusti, and often called lung fishes, which has been variously
estimated to be of subclass, ordinal, or even class value. Here the
subclass valuation may be accepted as expressing best the taxonomic
importance of the distinctive characters of the group. Among liv-
ing fishes the only ones that are at all related to the Dipnoans are the
Polypterids or Bichirs of Africa, These are the representatives of a
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 413

great group or subclass named Crossopterygians which were charac-
teristic or even predominant fishes of ancient times from the De-
vonian to the Jurassic period. One of the most striking external
features of the Crossopterygians was the prolongation of the axes
of the paired fins and the consequent lateral or fringelike arrange-
ment of the rays along the axes. It is to this characteristic that the
name crossopterygian (or fringe-finned) alludes.

During the same remote period in which the ancient Crossoptery-
gians flourished lived also fishes so much like those forms that they
were confounded with them in the same group by so good a naturalist
as Huxley and by many others. ‘They likewise had lobate paired
fins, but later it was found that instead of a distinct suspensorium
for the lower jaw there was no distinction between the suspensorial
elements and the cranium, and that all formed one piece with which
the lower jaw directly articulated. There were no distinct upper
jawbones. The heart of the living representatives has the same kind
of antechamber as that of the Crossopterygians although otherwise
different.

It was a long time before the facts thus epitomized became known
and appreciated. The histories of the ancient forms and the recent
ones were long told as those of beings entirely unrelated. That of
the living ones is as interesting as it is curious.

Two very distinct familhes of Dipnoans are represented in the
modern world, one (Ceratodontids) confined to northern Australan
rivers and the other (Lepidosirenids) common to South Anaerica
and Africa.

In 1836 a great naturalist-collector, Johann Natterer, discovered in
the Amazon basin an animal of which he sent two specimens to the
Imperial Austrian Museum, and by the custodian of the museum
(Fitzinger) it was described as a reptile related to the North Amer-
ican Siren and called Lepidosiren paradowus. Several years later
(1841) Thomas Weir sent two specimens of another animal, taken
from the Gambia River, West Africa, to London. This species was
described by Owen and considered to be a true fish related to the eels
and was at first called Protopterus annectens, but later it was referred
by its deseriber to the same genus as the South American animal.
Owen thought the two belonged to a peculiar “ family ” and made
“the nearest approach in the class of fishes to the Perennibranchiate
reptiles.” In fact, none of the old authors had any real appreciation
of the relations of either animal.

Quite a warfare was carried on for some time about the question
whether the animals were reptiles (amphibians) or fishes, but long
ago it was decided in favor of the piscine relationship of the Lepido-
sirenids.
414 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

The Ceratodontids are a family of ancient lineage and, indeed,
were for a long time supposed to have died out in the early Mesozoic
period.

In 1870, however, the startling intelligence was published that a
living species of Ceratodus had been discovered in Queensland.
The skepticism with which this announcement was at first received
was soon quieted by detailed examinations, comparisons, and deserip-
tions. It was later admitted that the ving fish was indeed different
generically from any early extinct species known (and named Weo-_
ceratodus), but it was nearly related to the ancient members of the
family. The family is of even greater interest and importance than
the Lepidosirenids, but as the species is not a special caretaker of
eggs or young, no notice of it is called for here and we pass on at
once to the Lepidosirenids.

THE LEPIDOSIRENIDS IN GENERAL.

The Lepidosirenids are much further removed from the ancient
lung fishes than the Ceratodontids, and so far no extinct members
have been discovered.

The shape is anguilliform and the paired fins are reduced to little
more than the stems, the rays being atrophied or lost. The teeth in
number are the same as in most of the order, a pair of palatine and
pair of vomerine teeth above and in opposition a corresponding pair
of molar teeth in the lower jaw. The pneumatoccele is manifest in
the form of a pair of entirely distinct lungs.

In the living animals, according to Professor Lankester, the body
is covered: by “ soft vascular connective tissue, in addition to a well-
developed epithelium,” and consequently “no scales at all or parts
of scales are visible on the surface of the body of a fresh or well-pre-
served specimen.” The scale-like areas which are * marked out on
the surface of the body ” are in fact lozenge-shaped areas “ outlined
by the greater abundance along their margins of the large branching
pigment cells of the connective tissue, which overlies as a uniform and
continuously flat layer the subjacent scales.”

Two genera of Lepidosirenids are represented by living species—in
Africa Protopterus, with three known species, and in South America,
Lepidosiren with one. Superficially they resemble each other so
much that some have referred both to the same genus, but the ana-
tomical differences are numerous and some of them striking. In
Lepidosiren there are only four shts between the branchial arches,
in Protopterus five; the scapular arch is connected with the cranium
in Lepidosiren only by a ligament, but in Protopterus there is an
osseous connection by a bone called the “ supraclavicle.” The body
of Lepidosiren is also more slender than in Protopterus, the ventral
fins farther back, and the dorsal fin considerably shorter.
= a’

THE PROTOPTERES.

Of the three described Protoptert the earliest known, Protopterus
annectens, has the widest range, extending from the streams of trop-
ical Africa, north of the Kongo basin, and from near the west coast
to the Nile. Protopterus wthiopicus is a species of the White Nile,
and Protopterus dolloi of the Kongo River. The last is distin-
guished for its slender body and many ribs (54) thus simulating the
Lepidosiren.

The Protopteres live mostly in shallow, muddy waters or swamps
which dry up during the rainless season. They spend most of the
time at the bottom, and in an aquarium one may “seek the darkest
corner” and squeeze itself “along one of the perpendicular angles
of the case.” At length it will arouse itself from this lethargy and
move about for exercise or for food. J.G. Wood (1863) was “ much
struck with the exceeding grace of its movements, which indeed very
strongly resemble those of the otter.” During its progress “ the
peculiar screwlike or spiral movement of the limbs is well exhibited.”

The open air has to be resorted to more or less for respiration.

Fic. 7.—Protopterus annectens. After Lankester.

McDonnell has recorded his experience with the fish. “At first it
used to come to the surface for air every three to five minutes, and,
taking it in with open mouth, sink from the surface; small bubbles
then generally escaped from the gill apertures, and frequently, before
again coming up for more air, a large quantity was expired, bubbling
up from the branchial outlets.” That the fish “has the power of
voluntarily closing the opercular opening was proved by the follow-
ing maneuver.” ‘“ The animal, burying its nose in the fine gravel in the
bottom of the vessel, used rapidly to gulp up the gravel and throw 1
out through the gills with a strong stream of water. It could at wil!
vary this operation by throwing the jet from the right or left aper-
ture.” After the owner had the animal * for some months,” however,
“and it had again become used to the aquatic respiration, it did not
come to the surface for air oftener than from ten to twenty minutes.”

As the water disappears, the fish burrows into the mud, contracts
the body, and secretes a great quantity of mucilaginous matter which
forms a cocoon around it, and thus it may remain interred unti!
future rain dissolves the mass and liberates it. But provision is made
416 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

for respiration meanwhile, for the vital functions are only partly sus-
pended. A tube is elaborated, lined with the same mucus which
forms the lining of the cocoon from the mouth of the fish to the sur-
face, and through this the Protoptere derives sufficient air to support
its aerial respiration. The presence of a fish in a cocoon may be
readily detected by introducing a straw into this tube. If the fish
be alive, quite a sharp cry may be immediately heard which is pro-
duced by the sudden expiration of the air from the lungs. Bou-
lenger, like Dubois, remarks that nothing surprises a person who has
not been forewarned more than
to hear the sound that may issue
from a clod of earth of small size.

The Protopteres under certain
conditions, indeed, give utterance
to decided sounds. Doctor Me-
Donnell received a cocoon * dug
up on the banks of the Gambia,”
aud proceded to liberate the in-
closed fish. He pushed a straw
into the air hole so as to touch it,
whereupon it squeaked so loudly
as not only to give unmistakable
evidence of its existence, but to
make the doctor quickly draw back
“his hand, 1n- fear lest” he
“might be bitten,” and while the
cocoon was being sawed and
broken open “the animal re-
peatedly produced vocal sounds,”

has explained, “ produced by the sudden expiration of the air from
the lungs,” reenforced by the walls of the cocoon acting as a sounding
board.

The Protopteres are very voracious and indulge in a great variety
of food. They mostly feed on tadpoles as well as grown up frogs,
fishes, crustaceans, insects, and worms, but they likewise will eat
boiled rice and beans. In captivity they have been mostly fed on
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 417

beef. According to J. G. Wood (1863) * the mode of eating was very
remarkable. Taking the extreme tip of the meat between its sharp
and strongly formed teeth it would bite very severely, the whole of
the head seeming to participate in the movement, just as the temporal
muscles of the human face move when we bite anything hard or tough.
It then seemed to suck the meat a very little farther into the mouth
and give another bite, proceeding in this fashion until it had sub-
jected the entire morsel to the same treatment. It then suddenly shot
out the meat, caught it as before by the tip, and repeated the same
process. After a third such maneuver it swallowed the morsel with
a quick jerk. The animal always went through this curious series
of operations, never swallowing the meat until after the third time
of masticating.” In other words, the animal subjects its food to a
kind of chewing process.

If left free in water where other fishes occur, they are very much
at home and exercise a choice of food at the expense of many a coin-
habitant. “A fish may be quietly swimming about suspecting no
evil ” and a Protoptere “ rise very quietly beneath it until quite close
to its victim” and then make “a quick dart with open mouth ” and
seize “the luckless fish just by the pectoral fin, and with a single
effort ” bite “entirely through skin, scales, flesh and bone, taking
out a piece exactly the shape of its mouth.” With this plunder the
Protoptere will sink to the bottom and there chew as is its wont. It
never chases its victim or takes a second bite. But when, in an aqua-
rium, the keeper offered a Protoptere a frog attached to the end of 2
stick it acted differently. ‘ No sooner did the frog begin to splash
than the fish rose rapidly beneath it, seized it in its mouth, dragged it
off the stick like a pike striking at a roach, and sunk to the bottom
with its prey. Not a vestige of the frog was ever seen afterwards.”
Tt was naturally inferred that “ the poor victim was gradually chawed
up like the beef with which the creature was formerly fed.”

Another peculiarity in ingestion of food was observed by MecDon-
nell (1860). He had “seen an active little minnow an inch and a
half or two inches from the mouth of the” Protoptere “suddenly
sucked in and devoured. The prey is drawn into the mouth with im-
mense rapidity by depressing the hyoid bone, and making a gulp
rather than a snap.”

They are very quarrelsome, and Boulenger declares that it is
almost impossible to preserve many together in an aquarium without
their maiming their fellows or amputating fins or tail. It is to be
remarked in this connection that those parts are readily regenerated,
but not to the same size or shape as the original, and consequently
much variety may be observable in those respects.
418 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

The nests and eggs of the Protoptere were looked for for a long
time before they were found. At length Mr. J. S. Budgett, in 1901,
had the good fortune to find them during his expedition to the

Gambia region. One day his native head fisherman, Sory, ap-
proached him “in a great state of excitement to say that he had
found the children of the cambona,” the native name of the Pro-
ioptere. “It was scorching mid-day, in the height of the rainy
season, the temperature 99° in the shade.” But Budgett hastened
to the swamp, and “there, about 10 yards from the water’s edge,
on dry ground, was an oval-shaped hole filled with water, and in the
water was a great commotion, the surface of the water being con-

tinually lashed from side to side by the tail of a cambona, the head of
which was way down under the ground. On being startled the
‘vambona disappeared downward, and the fisherman putting his
hand into the hole drew forth a handful of larval Protopteri.”
Having learned where to look for nests, Budgett found no difficulty
in finding others and supplying himself with material.

Special care is taken of the young. “Throughout the period of
the larve being in the nest, the male Protopterus stays with them and
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 419

guards them jealously, severely biting the incautious intruder.” The
nests are irregular in shape and about a foot deep. ‘“ There was
never any lining and the eggs were laid on bare mud. All the males
found in nests measured about eighteen inches in length.” (This,
however, is by no means near the maximum of size attained.

The rate of growth varies with circumstances. One noticed by
Wood was 10 inches long and weighed “a few ounces” when re-
ceived in London, and in three years grew to a length of 30 inches
and a weight of 64 pounds. “The rapidity of its growth,’ Wood
thought, “ may be accounted for by the fact that it had fed through-
out the entire year instead of lying dormant for want of water dur-
ing half its existence, and its size was apparently larger than it
would be likely to attain in its native state.”

The Protopteres are highly esteemed by the African negroes, and
they take advantage of their knowledge of the habits of the fishes
to secure a supply. They readily discover the presence of cocoons
in the dried-up swamp and dig them up with the surrounding earthy
covering, and these clods may be kept for future use. The flesh
is “ very soft and white.” Long ago the edibility, or rather savori-
ness, of the flesh was appreciated by whites. As far back as 1860
Doctor McDonnell described it as “ excellent as an article of food,”
and being “ highly palatable, somewhat resembling turbot; a consid-
erable quantity of yellow granular fat is diffused among the muscles,
to which, no doubt, is due in some degree its savory qualities.”

THE LEPIDOSIREN.

The habits of the only generally recognized Lepidosiren are anal-
ogous to those of the Protopteres. It lives in stagnant pools and
watery hollows in swamps by the side of a river, but not in the river

Fic. 11.—Lepidosiren paradoxa, After GOldi.

itself. Doctor Bohls was “unable to say from actual observation
that the Lepidosiren can live in the-dry mud of the pools, but as
the swamps do dry up when the weather is hot and little rain falls,
they must either die or pass through a period of nonaquatic life.”

This is probably effected by burrowing and hiding in “ the lower
regions of the mud,” and they “thus survive the drying up of the
pools.” Kerr was able to trace the career of one individual more
fully.

“On the approach of the dry season it ceased to ¢at entirely:
the muscles especially of its tail underwent fatty degeneration.”
It became still more sluggish than was its wont, “ remaining in its
420 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

burrow, and as the waters completely dried up it remained in the
mud, breathing air by means of an air hole.” It, however, appeared
to make nothing so specialized as the cocoon secreted by the Pro-
toptere.

Asa rule, the Lepidosiren is a sluggish animal and wriggles among
the dense vegetation which it affects. It acts as if it were almost
blind, “ merely distinguishing hght and shade,” and is very sensitive
to vibrations in the water. “A remarkable point ” also, at least of
the young, was observed by Kerr. ‘“ During the night the black
chromatophores all shrank up, so that the creature was of a nearly
pure white with round yellow spots.” With the return of daylight
the characteristic color is resumed. “At dawn the creatures are still
pale, but gradually darken, until about sunrise the normal deep
color is re-attaimed.”

Fig. 12.—Views of two dry-season burrows of Lepidosiren. After G. Kerr.

The Lepidosiren is carnivorous and feeds mainly on ‘“ marsh
snails,” or gastropods of the family of apple snails or Ampullariids,
one of which grows as large as a man’s fist and has a dense shell which
the powerful teeth of the Lepidosiren are well fitted to crush. It
by no means confines itself, however, to mollusks, for specimens
have been “ caught with a hook baited with fish,” so that the Lepi-
dosiren occasionally at least feeds on fishes. Vegetable matter, too,
was found “in the alimentary canal of the Lepidosiren together with
the remains of the snails,” but Doctor Bohls thought it “ probable
that this may have been swallowed accidentally and not as food.”
Kerr, however, thought that it deliberately fed “on masses of con-
ferve.” “.During the rainy season, life being easy and food ex-
tremely abundant, the Lepidosirens eat voraciously; fat is stored up
in great quantities in their tissues. This is especially the case in the
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 491

tail region, where the large masses of lateral muscles become in great
part replaced by orange-coloured fat. As the dry season comes on
and progresses so far as to cause the area of water to greatly diminish
in extent, a change comes, and the Lepidosiren ceases entirely to
feed.”

The Lepidosiren has great power in its jaws, and “the bite of
the animal is much feared by the Indians.” There are few enemies
strong enough to master it when adult, but, nevertheless, ** few exam-
ples of the fish are taken in a complete condition; one of the limbs
may be missing, or the tail injured (as often noticed also with Pro-
topterus). The Jacare (Alligator sclerops) feeds on the Lepidosiren
in these pools, and specimens were found with the whole region of
the body posterior to the anus in a state of regeneration—the ampu-
tation having been probably due to the bite of an alligator.”

Doubtless, however, part of the mutilation is due to attacks of the
bloodthirsty Pirayas, and part also, according to Lankester. to the
invasion of a parasite akin
to that which is so injurious
to the salmon (Saprolegnia
ferax).

The Lepidosiren has a sort
of voice. Its discoverer, Nat-
terer, long ago affirmed that
“his Lepidosiren could give a Head from below to show Head _partly projected
ery like that of a eat. Those anterior wee ait from water eee
observed by Doctor Bohls ae ESE eee Sas
gave out a sound when removed from the water, caused by expelling
air through the narrow aperture of the branchial chamber.” Accord-

oe

ing to others, too, it sometimes * growls.”

A Lepidosiren obtained at Obydos (a town in the State of Para)
was sent to Doctor G6ldi and was kept for some time alive in an
aquarium at Para. “During the day and when undisturbed ” the
fish was “a quiet and passive creature, not changing its curled posi-
tion for hours.” Only once did it attempt to bite the fingers of its
keeper. It remained “ generally indifferent even when small living
animals ” were offered to it “ with the pincers.” It refused all food
in the presence of observers, but as it became “in a better state of
nutrition than when it arrived” and “ decidedly fat and round ” it
must have taken food unseen. It was assumed to do so “ when it
burrows half the length of its body in the mud, as frequently seen.”

For respiration it ascended “ from time to time to the surface of
the water, and put out a portion of its head.” The operation lasted
several seconds. In a large aquarium this was done only “ at inter-
vals of several hours,” but in a smaller one much more frequently.
“ The respiration is sometimes singularly prolonged. When descend-
422 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

ing, a series of air-bubbles is generally expelled from the branchial
apertures on each side of the anterior part of the body. The whole
body is covered with a viscous or gluey substance, which fills the
water with whitish flakes when the Dipnoan executes more rapid and
violent evolutions.”

The breeding season follows with the rainy season and “ within
the first few weeks after liberation from the mud,” in which the
Lepidosirens have been imprisoned during the dry season. On the
approach of the breeding season the papille of the ventral limbs of
the males grow out “ into blood-red filaments one or two inches long.”
A sort of nest is made “in an underground burrow ” excavated at
the bottom of the swamp, and therein the eggs are laid by the female,
but “ apparently usually guarded by the male ” alone.

The progress of eggs and young were watched by Kerr.

Eventually there hatched out a tadpole-like larva, devoid of pigments, the
horny eggshell undergoing a process of | digestion before splitting. The
laryee were remarkable for the extremely well-developed sucker and the

pel.

large external gills (strikingly amphibian characters said to be absent in Cer-
atodus). The external gills were four in number on each side. About six
weeks after hatching the external gills atrophied, as did also the sucker; the
creature assumed a much darker, almost black, colour, and its habits became
much more active. The young Lepidosiren remained in its nest till about 60
mm. [about 24 inches] long. For nearly three months it lived in the yolk in the

walls of the enteron, but did not eat at all. About this time yellow spots ap-
peared on the larva, and it remained so spotted till over one foot long. The
young Lepidosirens had proportionately larger limbs than the adult, and used
them much in irregular alternation in clambering through the mud.

The Indians in the neighborhood of its haunts depend largely on
the Lepidosirens, as well as other fishes caught in the pools. The
Lepidosiren can not be caught with nets (on account of the weeds),
nor, commonly, by hook and line. They are mostly obtained by a
spear or harpoon of about 8 feet in length. ‘“ The Indians plunge
into the water in parties, prodding the bottom of the paols with these
instruments.” Doctor Bohls himself went out with a party of ten
Indians. The ovaries of the Lepidosiren are preferred as an article
of food to the salmon-like flesh, and are pressed into a kind of cake,
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. “ 423
CROSSOPTERYGIANS.

During the later Paleozoic period and the sueceeding Mesozic the
predominant fishes were forms distinguished by the axial prolonga-
tion of the skeleton of the paired fins, pectoral as well as ventral.
The species and genera were many, and they represented a number of
famihes. They early disappeared—during the later Mesozoic—from
the waters of countries later to be inhabited by civilized men, but in
others the race or “ phylum” must have been continued, for to-day
relatives are still living in the fresh waters of the African cemitinent,
and there only. The last, though obviously akin to the ancient fishes,
are not near relatives, but in some respects quite different. Modern
naturalists concur in the opinion that many old forms and the new
constitute a great comprehensive group to which the name of Cvos-
sopterygians (Crossopterygii) has been given. By tome that group
is called a subclass; by others a superorder or an order. In the belief
that it is a natural group agreement is universal.

All, extinct and recent, had or have the paired limbs developed
round an axial extension of the paired fin skeleton, so that the fins
are “ lobate.”” A distinct suspensorium of the lower jaw is developed,
connected with the cranium by a simple suture. The skull is also
characteristic in that the upper jawbones are not distinct, as i
typical fishes, but continuous with the cranium as in Amphibians.
The heart is preceded by an arterial muscular bulb, whose cavity is
beset with several longitudinal rows of valves.

The cardiac character is of course known only from the living
forms of the group, and they have been recognized as a distinct type
(Cladistia). These Cladistians, which have been estimated by some
ichthyologists as an order, are distinguishable by the peculiar pectora!]
fins. The base of each of those fins consists of a Y-shaped part artic-
ulating with a convex condyle of the scapular cartilage, and between
the forks of the Y-shaped element is a broad cartilaginous plate. On
the hind edge of this many ray-lke bones or actinosts are set, and
these support the pectoral fin.

It has been urged that this member manifests the nearest approach
from the fish side to the fore limb of a terrestrial vertebrate. The
“convex condyle of the scapula ” is supposed to be homologous with
the humerus, the Y-shaped element represents the radius and ulna,
the intervening cartilage the material for the carpus, and the actinosts
the metacarpals. The group is consequently one of singular interest
to the morphologist. The interest is not lessened by the imperfection
of the history of the group. While its ancient relatives died out
countless ages ago in the explored regions of the earth, in Africa
one branch of the group must have survived, and a number of species
still represent the order and the subclass in many an African river.
These representatives all belong to one family, called the Polypterids,
424 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

THE BICHIRS.

The family of Polypterids or Bichirs is peculiarly interesting, as,
to a greater extent than any other recent group, it is intermediate
between fishes and amphibians—that is, between vertebrates having
fins and those with legs. The body is more or less elongated or sub-
cylindrical and covered with oblique rows of enameled rhombic
seales; the head is snakelike and protected by bony plates; the caudal
fin rounded and continuous upward and forward with the dorsal fin;
the dorsal furniture is especially remarkable; there are along most of
the length of the back a row of spines (very different from the
spines of other fishes) with whose hinder surfaces generally several
raylike appendages articulate and a membrane is developed, thus
resembling separate finlets. The anal is small and almost continuous
with the caudal fin, and the ventrals are also far back; the pectorals
are rounded and most prominent below the middle of the hinder
margin.

The family has two very distinct genera

Polypterus and Cala-
michthys. Of the former one or more of 10 species are found every-

Fic, 16.—Polypterus bichir, After Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,

where in tropical Africa; of the latter only one—a very elongated,
eel-like form without ventral fins—occurs in a few rivers of western
Africa.

The species of Polypterus are so much alike that they have been
supposed by some to be variants of one species, but they are really
well distinguished by differences in the number of dorsal spines
(ranging from 5 to 18), size of scales, size of eyes, and other charac-
ters. The oldest known species (it was known to the ancient Egyp-
tians, but was first described by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1809) is
at one extreme with 15 to 18 spines, and one, described by W. O.
Ayers, of Boston, in 1850, is at the other extreme, with 5 to 8 spines.

The habits of the Polypterids are characteristic. They are in the
main bottom fishes and lethargic. But they are not confined to such
places and conditions. Harrington found that they also live “in
the deeper depressions of the muddy river bed,” and there they are
“active ” swimmers and “ not essentially bottom-livers or mudfishes.”
They are most active at nighttime, when “in search of food.” But
in shallow water they will he for long periods on the mud at the
bottom of the water, with the body a little upraised forward and
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 425

resting on the outspread pectoral fins, whose form is so well adapted
to give a wide resting surface. At last they may deliberately move
away, working the pectorals like a fan, the lower rays being the first
deflected. If the water is foul, they will dart to the surface, take a
mouthful of air, and then rapidly descend to the ground again. It
is noteworthy that part of the air gulped down escapes by the spira-
cles behind the eyes.

-The name pneumatoccele was coined as a common name for a vis-
eus, which may be either an air bladder or a lung—that is, for the
primitive diverticulum of the intestine, which was not specialized as
one or the other. The pneumatoccele of the Polypterids is double on
the floor of the abdominal cavity, and cellular; it is, indeed, a
partly united pair of lungs, rather than
an air bladder, and acts as a lung and not
as a hydrostatic organ or air bladder.
The emission of air instead of water
through the spiracles is in harmony with
this function as a lung. This approxima-
tion of the Polypterids to amphibians by
its respiratory function is coordinate with
another character of amphibians. In
typical fishes the main instrument of pro-
pulsion is the tail and caudal fin, and the
pectorals chiefly preserve its equilibrium ;
in the Polypterids the pectoral fins
assume a large share in the function of
progression, supplementing the caudal.

Although provided with real lungs,
Polypterids do not appear to be able to
live long out of water. At least Harring-
ton complains that they “ will not survive more than three or four
hours out of water, and only then under the most favorable condi-
tions—that is, covered with damp grass and weeds.” This feebleness
was a great obstacle to success in getting mature eggs and sperm at
the same time.

Another characteristic in the actions of the Polypterids has been
recorded by Harrington. “ Peculiar in the swimming movements ”
is “the manner in which the head moves freely from side to side.
This produces the appearance of a progression more or less snake or
eel-like, although in general the powerful sweeps of the strong tail
characterize the progression as fish-like.”

The food of the Polypterids is limited by their ability of locomo-
tion and ingestion; it consists mainly of small fishes and amphibians
as well as crustaceans, but the variety is liberal. Harrington found
that besides small catfishes, such as the “ armoot, bayad, schilbe, and

sM 1905 31

Fic 17.—Polypterus bichir. After
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.

426 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

schal, which were commonly used as bait,” they eat “a great many
other teleosts, as 1s evidenced by the more or less undigested remains
in the stomachal pouch of such forms” as knilhe fishes, eels, and boltis.
They apparently catch such fishes alive, and they are most attracted
by “live bait;” the food is always swallowed whole. “Although
catfish are usually taken head first, some fish were found in the stom-
achal pouch in a reverse position; their undigested remains are
probably ejected through the mouth. The pouch is admirably adapted
for resisting the very dangerous and strong spines possessed by the
catfishes.”

The spawning season commences nearly with the rainy season or
the inundation of the Nile and may last several months, or from June
to September. As the season for reproduction approaches, the habit-
ual lethargy of the fishes diminishes, their movements become more
sprightly, and males and females meet. The eggs become developed,
and about as large as grains of millet; they are of a bright green
color. The males also become more differentiated by the develop-
ment of the anal fin. This is not only larger than in the female, but
specially modified in form.

Another noteworthy circumstance is that “the males are smaller
than the females and, although they are much less numerous, are
generally taken in company with one or more females.” Harrington
obtained “ only twelve males to fifty-eight females.”

On account of the great interest connected with the relationship
of the Bichirs, a number of expeditions have been sent or led to Af-
rica for the purpose of studying the life history and especially the
oviposition and development of the species. The first in the field
were Americans—parties from Columbia University. In the spring
of 1898 Dr. N. R. Harrington, then a “ fellow in zoology ” of the
university, with Dr. Reid Hunt, went up the Nile in search of the
Polypterids and remained till September 10. He found many fishes
with eggs and spawn, but not the combination of the ripe products.
Later Mr. J. S. Budgett undertook to visit equatorial Africa for the
purpose of investigating the species, and in 1901 he published some
important facts relative to the habits of some of the species. After
several ineffectual attempts he succeeded in confining some fishes in
four inclosures in a swamp off the Gambia River. He fed them with
minced meat, and as soon as he put food into the water at one end of
the inclosure some of the fishes “came hurrying through the grass
from all parts and greedily devoured it, without the least appearance
of shyness.” He was unable, however, to obtain eggs from them or
to effectually fertilize those from other individuals. He found that
“the main difficulties in obtaining the eggs seem to he in the fact
that Polypterus probably makes no nest, and certainly lays but few
eggs at a time, these being scattered, probably broadcast, throughout
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 427

the thick vegetation of the flooded grass-lands. The eggs are minute,
and therefore the chances of finding them in a state of nature are
small in the extreme.”

In 1902 Budgett went to Uganda and returned by way of the Nile,
in search of Polypterus. Below Murchison Falls, during August,
he found Polypterus spawning and the fertilization of over a hundred
ova was secured, but this, “the most promising attempt yet made
to breed Polypterus artificiaily, again failed.”

The youngest Polypterus yet found was an inch and a quarter
long. It had external gills as “long as the head. It was a most
beautiful object,” above striped with black on a golden ground and
with a golden stripe running from the snout onto the end of the
stem of the external gill. It was “ extraordinarily active, and, during
the moments when it was at rest, supported the weight of its body
on its pectoral fins, the blade of the fin being turned forwards and
rot backwards as is usually the case in the adult.”

ic. 18.—Polypterus senegalus larva, 14 in. long, in a very characteristic attitude. After
Budgett.

At last, during a third voyage to Africa, in southern Nigeria in
the months of August and September, 1903, Budgett sueceeded: in
obtaining eggs and milt of Polypterus senegalus in proper con-
dition and time. He was “ able to fertilize a large quantity of eggs.”
The early development was found to be very similar to that of a
batrachian—* astoundingly frog-like ” was his first announcement—
“the segmentation being complete and fairly equal and the process
of invagination resembling that of the frog’s egg.. Prominent ven-
tral folds are formed which arch over in the normal fashion.”

A characteristic of the Polypterids is the development and reten-
tion for a long time of the peculiar external larval branchizx or gills,
one on each side, reminding one of similar structures in the Dipnoans.
These have a featherlike form, with a tapering cutaneous axis
bordered by rows of barblike filaments above and below, converging
into a terminal portion; they originate behind the upper extensions
of the branchial apertures. Their persistence is variable, and some-
times one may last much longer than the other, as in a specimen of
the Polypterus congicus, nearly 9 inches (22 ecm.) long, which
retained the right gill but had lost the left one.

Here, for the present, the history of the Bichir’s propagation ends.
Four special expeditions have been made and two excellent natu-
calists—Harrington and Budgett—sacrificed their lives in the search
for further details. Another and more fortunate explorer must arise
before the full history of the fish is known and the extent to which
provision is made for eggs and young.

The Bichir is not only interesting from a scientific point of view,
for it may be considered as a food fish and is by no means a bad one.
Indeed, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire claimed that its flesh 1s white and
much more savory than that of the other inhabitants of the Nile.
As the fish can not be readily cut with a knife, on account of its coat
of mail, it is put whole in the fire, and can then, after the limbs
have been cut out, be skinned and handled with ease.

the Latin designation, Améa calva. Its interest arises from the fact
that it has, like the gar-pikes (Lepidosteids), the merit, for the zoolo-
gist. of being the only survivor of an ancient type of fishes, and thus
preserving the records in flesh and bone of the details of structure as
well as habits characteristic of one of the old types. It is at once

the representative of a peculiar genus (Ama), a peculiar family
(Amiids), and a distinct order or suborder (Cycloganoids). But
although now solitary and confined to some streams and lakes in
North America, not long ago in geological history it had numerous
relatives in many parts of the world, and a few survived in Europe
till the Miocene period, when they had, as contemporaries there,
species of Lepidosteids, as have those now living in America.

Although dogfish and mudfish are the names in widest use, there
are many other popular names in more limited acceptation, such as
bowfin, grindle, or, in more detail, “John A. Grindle,” lawyer,
marshfish and blackfish. Blackfish is the name current in the resi-
dence of the species nearest Washington and the coast cities; that is,
about the Dismal Swamp of Virginia. But it and all the other com-
pounds with fish are much better known to most persons and in litera-
ture in connection with other fishes, and consequently bowfin may be
advantageously used here.

Fie. 21.—Bowfin (Amia calva).

The bowfin has attracted the attention of many persons, and by
various zoologists it has been watched by day and night, as well as
when feeding and breeding, and consequently its life history is quite
well known. Chief of the historians of its doings are F. Fiilleborn
(1894), Whitman and Kycleshymer (1897), Bashford Dean (1898),
and especially the latest, Jacob Reighard « (1903). From these we are
able to derive an unusually satisfactory view of the fish. For details
reference may be had to the writers just named, and a brief summary
need only be given here.

The bowfin is a strong and well-armed fish, both as to the bony
armature of the head as well as the teeth. It is one of the large fishes,
when fully mature attaining a length of over 2 feet, often 21, or even
somewhat more. As usual among fishes, the females average larger
than the males. The males, apparently, are much more numerous.

The geographical range of the bowfin is quite extensive, and vet
restricted in a peculiar way. It is not found in the New England

430 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

States (except in Lake Champlain) nor in the waters, flowing east-
ward, of the Middle States, but it is an inhabitant of the Great Lakes
(except Superior) and of the Mississippi basin, as well as of the South-
ern States up to Virginia and the Dismal Swamp.

Sluggish waters are its favorite haunts, and a couple of its names—
mudfish and marshfish—indicate places in which they may be found.
But, as Dean has recognized, “ the general habitat of the fish varies
at different seasons of the year. In summer it frequents deeper
water; in spring it comes into the marshy shallows and makes its
way through reedy places where the water is scarcely deep enough
to cover the dorsal fin.” For winter quarters, like the carp, it
selects deeper water. Ayers found it “in schools closely huddled
together in the bottom of pockets or shallow depressions of the
gravelly beds” of Lake Oconomowoe (Wisconsin) “among the
water weeds.” In such places the fishes may “lie so close together
that occasionally two individuals are impaled on the fish-spear by
ene throw.” When disturbed by such intrusion, “ they scatter from
their resting-places, moving out a short distance to return quickly

after the first few disturbances.” Doubtless during the cold weather

they cease to feed and live on the fatty stores they accumulated dur-
ing the summer.

The bowfin is a more or less nocturnal animal, but stirring mainly
about the beginning and end of night. After considerable observa-
tion, Dean concluded that it “is rather to be regarded as active at
twilight. It takes the hook best shortly after sundown and during
early morning.” At such times it is “exceedingly active under
natural conditions.”

Voracity is characteristic of the bowfin, and smaller fishes and
crayfishes are its chief prey. Some of its victims may be half as long
as itself, but generally they are considerably smaller. Its approach
to prey is rather slow and stealthy; but when near enough it quickly
darts and seizes the object which it has neared. According to
Hallock, one has “ been known to bite a two-pound fish clean in two
the very first snap.” As a rule the object must show evidence of life
to render it desirable. Dean at least “ found no evidence that the
dogfish eats fish, or, more accurately, some fishes, after they are
dead,” and “dead perch and sunfish remain untouched ” where the
fish “is very abundant.” Nevertheless it sometimes takes advantage
of “a rubbish heap in the water,” and “scraps of meat and a lump
of raw potato have been found in the stomach of one.”

When warm weather sets in, the bowfin leaves its winter quarters
and begins to make good the loss of flesh incurred during the winter.
The impulse to perform their procreative duties is soon felt and the
sexes show the effects. The females become heavy with ripening
egos, but retain the dull colors of winter. The males assume a bril-
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 431

liant livery; all their fins become a bright green and of the same hue
as the pond plants among which they rove; the bronze of the back
and sides is furbished up; the stripes on the cheeks show in bolder
relief, and above all the spots at the base of the caudal fin grow
vividly distinct; the spot of each side culminates in being velvety
black, and its surrounding ring is of a bright orange or yellow color.

Striking and glaring as is the color of a male fish when isolated, it
is quite otherwise when amid his natural surroundings. Then,
Reighard testifies, “ one is struck by certain resemblances between
his colors and those of surrounding objects. All his fins are of a
green like that of the aquatic vegetation and blend with it readily.
The reticular markings on his sides bear a close resemblance to the
shadows cast by the intererossing leaves of the vegetation floating
at or near the surface.” This resemblance is so close that Reighard,
“after prolonged examination at a distance of a foot or two,” was
unable to determine with certainty “ which of the reticulations on
the side of the male were due to pigment and which were shadows.
They could only be distinguished through some slight movement of
the fish. Moreover, the tail-spot bears a striking resemblance to cer-
tain refraction images that are commonly seen on the bottom in shal-
low water.”

In April the mating is generally at its height. Males and females
seek each other. Both resort to places fit for their future functions.
Reighard tells that “ the localities selected for nests are quiet bays or
inlets, well-grown with water-plants and affording sheiter tor the
nests in the form of stumps, bushes or fallen trees. Those localities
are preferred in which the removal of the growing vegetation leaves
a thick mat of fibrous rootlets for the bottom of the nest.” Each
nest is a saucerlike excavation from 1 to 3 feet in diameter and
from 4 to 8 inches deep. The bottom of the excavation is usually of
the kind of fibrous roots just noticed, “ which, freed of all earth,
form a thick spongy mass. Sometimes, however, the bottom is of
gravel or sand, or even of black loam, and in two cases” observed by
Reighard, it was of “ the dead, brown, water-soaked stems or leaves
of cattail or other similar water plants.” Of course there are still
other variants from the average nest.

The male unaided constructs a nest, and, according to Reighard,
“works chiefly by night, not by day.” There are, however, some
exceptions, and Reighard records that ‘a half-completed nest found
at 9 a.m. on April 23 was found completed in the afternoon of the
same day.” Reighard was convinced “that the male uses the snout
in making the nests” from “the fact that in the nesting season the
snout of the male is frequently covered with scratches where the
epidermis has been removed, and the underlying connective tissue
shows white beneath it. Probably the male in building the nest
432 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

breaks off the young shoots with the snout, or by the movements of
the body, or by biting.” Doubtless “ he then sweeps the underlying
rootlets clean of bottom ooze by the fanning movements of his pec-
toral and caudal fins. When he excavates into sand or gravel, the
work is probably done largely, as in teleosts, by fanning with the
caudal and pectoral fins. This much may be inferred from the frag-
mentary observations ” recorded. .

A nest is made without any selected mate and sometime in advance
of finding or selection of one by its maker. Meanwhile the male
stays beside it more or less persistently. “If the female does not
appear, the waiting male ceases after a time to guard the empty
nest,” and leaves. More likely, however, a seeking female, a night

or two later, may find the nest and its maker. After a longer or
shorter play, caressing and circling about, the two come together
side by side, the one laying the eggs, the other fertilizing. On one
oceasion observed by Reighard, the preliminary play lasted * one hour
and twenty minutes.” After the first pairing, the two fishes may
again play and come together as much as five or six times.

The stock of eggs thus provided is watched over assiduously by
the male, but he is quite willing to admit another female to the nest,
and not infrequently one enters and adds to the store. But while
two, or even more, females may spawn in one nest, oviposition being
intermittent, a female may also spawn in two or more nests. Under
such circumstances the number of eggs in any nest may vary greatly,
from a few to many thousands. In one case Reighard could only
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 433

7

find “ twenty-five freshly laid ” ones. Eggs “ may be over the whole
inner surface of the nest, on the bottom only, or on one side only.
If fibrous roots are present, they are invariably on these.”

The stock of eggs being provided, the male bowfin redoubles his
guardianship and “hes for the most part motionless, or with only
slight movements of his fins, but at intervals he moves over the nest
and thus by the movements of his fins keeps the eggs free from sedi-
ment, which would otherwise smother them.” All the time he is on
the outlook for intruders, and especially against other males. One
Reighard saw rushed at another male and “ struck him with his head
in the middle of the side and hurled him two feet from the nest.”
Generally there is no contest, for the rights of the nest maker ap-
pear to be respected, but occasicnally too great aggressiveness on the
part of the occupant or audacity of an intruder results in a regular
battle. Whitman and Eycleshymer tell of one: Two males that
claimed a female were unwilling to yield, one to the other, and “a
fierce battle for supremacy ensued” between them. ‘“ They ap-
proached from opposite sides of the nest and locked jaws in a most
ferocious manner. Their struggles were so violent that a cloud of
muddy water soon arose and obscured them from view.” Eventually
one of the males was left about the nest, and his attentions were
accepted by the female, who, “ during the battle, had remained con-
cealed at the side of the nest.”

Vigilant though the watching may be, it is not entirely continuous
during the period of incubation; Reighard found “that at many
visits ” males were not found over their nests “in spite of careful
search through all the surroundings.” The absences were most nu-
merous in the morning and least so in the afternoon. But day after
day the nest is guarded most of the time. Nine days elapse before the
eggs are hatched and seven to nine more before the larvee are prepared
to leave the nest. The newly hatched larve are not quite a third
of an inch (7 millimeters) long; those ready to take to free life are
nearly half an inch (11 to 12 millimeters) long. By this time black
pigment has developed and the whole body except the belly is “ very
dark greenish black or greenish brown.” The swarm reminds one
both of a swarm of tadpoles and a swarm of bees. First the larvee
are stationary and then they commence to move. “They swim to-
gether in a swarm which moves in a generally circular direction about
the edge of the nest or just outside it. The larvee, though not pro-
gressing continuously as individuals, form a swarm which neverthe-
less progresses, one way or another, with many internal irregulari-
ties.” The course of a school from which its guardian was frightened
away has been well epitomized and illustrated by Reighard.

“This swarm was among hummocks (dotted areas) and bunches
of grass (lined areas), and when the observation began was at A.
434 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

Its subsequent movements, its subdivisions, and the frequent returns
to the point B, where, without much doubt, either the school or the
male had been for some time previously, and its final reunion with
the male when, after fifteen minutes, he returned to the point C, may
all be followed in the figure. These larvee were about 20 millimeters
long. The rate at which the schools move increases greatly with the
age of the larve and doubtless also at any age with the conditions,
such as abundance of food. In a school of larve of about 20 milli-
meters ” Reighard “noted a rate of about 16 meters per hour. In

another case” he “ found a school of larvee of about the same size

within 5 meters of the spot on which it was five hours earlier, another

within 12 meters of its original location, and,another within 30

meters.”

By the middle of June, “ when the larve are some 90 to 100 milli-
meters (about 4 inches) long, the schools are much spread out, con-
sist of few individuals, and are moving with great rapidity.” The
male still continues with them. But by high summer all the swarms
have broken up and the young dispersed to lead independent lives.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 435

After complete dispersion and when the young fishes have to pro-
vide for themselves their habits are those of the species in miniature.
When 3 to 5 inches long, the colors are quite striking; yellow, red,
and green tinting the vertical fins and blackish bordering them, red
dyeing the gill membranes, and three distinct bars bordered with
lighter or orange running along the sides of the head, the uppermost
through the eye, the lowermost along the jaws; later these fade out.
When a year old they are about 10 inches long and like the parents
in form and color. Most individuals probably do not reach sexual
maturity till the third or fourth year.

The bowfin is not a favorite with epicures, and is, indeed, generally
rejected and not ranked as a food fish at all. The flesh is soft and
disagreeable.

CHARACINIDS.

The family of Characinids includes a very large number of species
(about 300), confined to South (and middle) America and Africa;
species ave the sole American representatives of the carp-like fishes
in the Southern Conti-
nent, but in Africa may
be found side by side
with the Cyprinids, espe-
cially Barbels. Nothing

1901 J. S. Budgett re-

corded a noteworthy fact respecting a peculiar provision for the
protection of the eggs and young of a common African species, the
Sarcodaces odoé. According to him, in the flooded grass lands of
equatorial Africa along the Gambia River, “the eye is frequently
caught by masses of white foam floating on the surface of the water.
On close inspection it is seen to be filled with numerous transparent
ova,” about 24 millimeters in diameter. The fry hatched from the
egos “ make their way through the foam * * * down to the sur-
face of the water, and there the young larve hang holding to the
surface of the water by a large adhesive organ situated on the front
of the head.” The blacks were well acquainted with the nature of
the foamy nests, and told Budgett what they were, and were corrob-
orated by his investigations.

The peculiar fabrication of a foamy receptacle for the eggs is
analogous to the provision made by some catfish-like forms—the Cal-
lichthyids—as well as the celebrated fish of Paradise (J/acropodus
viridi-auratus), a relative of the Gourami. This fact is especially
noteworthy, as the three groups which make such similar nests are in
no wise related, and all three differ from most of their relatives in
their peculiar oviposition.

436 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

In an article on “The nest-builders of the sea,” by Dr. C. F.
Holder, published in Harper’s New Monthly Magazine for December,
1883 (LXVITI, 105), a figure is published of a “hanging nest of
perai,” representing a cocoanut-like object floating in the water,
loosely, suspended in the water from a palm-like tree, with two
fishes close by. Doctor Holder can not, at present at least, give me
the source of his information, but thinks it was “ from some French
journal.” By perai, piraya or piranha is meant.

CYPRINIDS.

In the enormous family of the Cyprinids, or carp-like fishes, the
species generally neglect their eggs after oviposition, but a few make
special provision for them. One remarkable method is that exempli-
fied by the Bitterling of central Europe, and illustrated in the
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections (XLVITI, 203, pl. 53).
Several American also take care of their eggs, especially the Horned
Dace (Semotilus atromaculatus), the Black-headed Dace (Pime-
phales promelas), and the Stone-roller (Campostoma anomalum).
Their nest-making habits have long been known, but imperfectly,
and next winter (1907) a full account may be expected from Prof.
Jacob Reighard, of Ann Arbor, who has been observing them for
years, and has already published preliminary communications.

THE GLANIS.

Many centuries ago a fish was noticed inhabiting fresh waters in
northwestern Greece that exercised particular care for both the eggs
and young. The fish was especially an inhabitant of the river Achel-
ous, the largest of Greece, and was then known as the Glanis. Aris-
totle gave more details respecting this fish than about any other. The
mode of oviposition and the subsequent paternal care manifested for
the eggs are described at considerable length in his History of Ani-
mals. The translation of his words from the Greek, due to Prof.
Louis Agassiz, is the best that has appeared in English, and is there-
fore here reproduced with few modifications. Agassiz was probably
assisted by the eminent Greek scholar, Professor Felton. Aristotle’s
account of the Glanés is not a continuous one, but distributed under no
less than seven chapters, wherein various organs or functions are con-_
sidered. The sections relative to the spawning habits and parental
care occur in the sixth and ninth books.

In the sixth book (chap. 13, sees. 2 to 4) the manner of spawning 1s
described as follows:

The fresh-water fishes spawn in the still waters of rivers and !akes among the
reeds, as the phoxinos (minnow) and the perke (yellow perch). The glanis
and the perke give out their spawn in a continuous string, like the frogs; and,
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 437

indeed, the spawn is so wound up that the fishermen reel it off, at least that of
the perke, from the reeds in lakes.

The larger glanis spawns in deep waters, some at the depth of a fathom; the
smaller in shallower places, especially among the roots of willows or some other
tree, and also among the reeds, or the mosses.

They copulate, sometimes a very large with a very small one, and bringing
the parts together which some call the navel, and through which they discharge
the seed, the females the eggs and the males the sperma. All the eggs that are
mingled with the sperma become generally on the first day white and larger,
and a little later the eyes of the fishes become visible. These at first, in all
fishes as also in other animals, are early conspicuous on account of their size.
And those of the eggs that the sperm does not touch, as in the case of sea-
fishes, are useless and sterile.

But in these fertile eggs, as the fishes grow larger, a kind of husk separates.
And this is the envelope that encloses the egg and the young fish. When the
sperm has mingled with the egg the spawn becomes more viscous among the
roots, or wherever it may have been deposited. And where the greatest quantity
is deposited the male guards the eggs, and the female, having spawned, departs.
The growth of the glanis from the egg is very slow, wherefore the male keeps

watch forty or fifty days, that the young may not be devoured by the fishes that
happen to be in their neighborhood.

Aristotle incidentally adds, in subsequent paragraphs, that “ the
eggs of the glanis become as large as the seed of the orobos” (see.
5)—that is, the millet—and that none of the fresh-water fishes “ ex-
cept the glanis watch their eggs ” (sec. 6).

How the eggs are taken care of after spawning is told in a later
book (Book TX, chap. 25, sec. 6) :

Of the river fishes, the male glanis takes great care of its young. For- the
female, having brought forth, departs; but the male, where the greatest deposit
of eggs has been formed, remains by them watching, rendering no other service
except keeping off other fishes from destroying the young. He does this for
forty or fifty days, until the young are sufficiently grown to escape from the
other fishes. And he is known to the fishermen wherever he may chance to
be watching his eggs; for he keeps off the fishes by rushing movements, and by
making a noise and moaning. And he remains by the eggs with so much of
natural affection that the fishermen, when the eggs adhere to deep roots, bring

438 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

them up to the shallowest place they can; but he does not even then leave his
offspring; but if he chance to be a young fish he is easily taken by the hook,
because he snaps at all the fishes that approach him; but if he is already
accustomed to this, and has swallowed hooks before, he does not even then
desert his young, but breaks the hook by a very strong bite.

In 1839 two of the greatest ichthyologists of the last century,
Cuvier and Valenciennes,* regarded this account with great skep-
-ticism and recapitulate it, concluding with this opinion:

What Aristotle relates in detail, and in two passages, of the care which the
male silurus takes of the eggs of his female, borders a little on the marvelous.

Fic. 26.—Aristotle’s catfish (Parasilurus aristotelis) on nest. (Idea.

According to him, the large siluri deposit them in deep waters; the smaller
among the roots of willows and other trees, among the reeds or even the mosses.
The female, having laid them, leaves them, but the male guards and defends
them; and, as these eggs are long in hatching, he continues this care forty or
fifty days.

Skepticism was not at all unnatural in view of the fact that the
French naturalists thought there was no doubt that the Aristotelian
fish was specifically identical with the Sturus glanis of central
Kurope; “On ne peut douter que notre silure ne soit le [’A@vis
d’Aristote,” they exclaimed (p. 344). This opinion was confirmed,

a Histoire Naturelle des Poissons, t. 14, pp. 350, 351.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 439

they thought, by the fact that the Siiurus is called at the present day
Glanos or Glono m Turkey. Fifty-six years later (1895) another
eminent European ichthyologist (Prof. F. A. Smitt) declared that .
“the ancient account of Aristotle, that the male hatches the roe, is now
regarded as dubious.”

It may be here recalled that the Si/wrus-glanis does not care for its
eggs, but after depositing and fecundating them, the parents leave
them to Dame Nature. The skepticism of naturalists respecting the
statements of Aristotle was then quite natural as long as there was
supposed to be no structural difference between the common silurus
and the glanis of the Achelous.

From the fourth century before the Christian era a leap may be
made to the latter half of the nineteenth and into a new world.

America is not inhabited by any species of the same group or even
subfamily as the Glanis, but has numerous representatives of the same
family and of a subfam-
ily quite closely related
to the Silurines. Species
are found almost every-
where in the streams and
lakes of eastern America
and the valley of the
Mississippi, and are gen-
erally known as catfishes.
Tt was also long known
that some at least exer-
cised care of their eggs
and young. It was there-
fore quite natural that
Prof. Louis Agassiz
should accept with implicit faith the account of the ancient natu-
ralist and at the same time be skeptical as to the correctness of
the identification of the Grecian fish with that which he had well
known in central Europe. In 1856 he received specimens of a Silurid
from the same river (Achelous) in Acarnania from which Aristotle
had secured his Glanis, and these were evidently of the same kind
as that described by the old naturalist; according to C. Felton,
they even still bear a name, “ Glanidi, formed, according to numerous
analogies, from the genitive (Glanidos) ” of glanis. The specimens,
on comparison with some of the wels, were found to be quite different,
the species was named Glanis Aristotelis, and an interesting account
of them, in the form of translations from Aristotle, was presented to
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and published in their
“ Proceedings ” (III, pp. 325-334).

Fic 27.—Head from aboye of Aristotle’s catfish (Parastlurus

440 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

In this long account, however, no indication was given of any
structural differences between the Grecian and German fishes, and
consequently for half a century the species has been ignored by Euro-
pean naturalists. Indeed, in the latest English work on fishes (The
Cambridge Natural History, Vol. VII, p. 593) the great ichthyolo-
gist, Dr. George Boulenger, expressly affirms that the “ only Euro-
pean representative of the family,” Siluride, is, the Silurus glanis.
Nevertheless, in 1890, in response to the present writer’s demand for
information, Samuel EK. Garman published a description of the
specimens collected and commented on in 1856, and called the species
“ Silurus (Parasilurus) Aristotelis.” Vt appears that “from the
young of S. glanis L. of equal length, they are readily distinguished
by the possession of four barbels instead of six,” as well as “ by the
difference in shape of those on the maxillaries—they being shorter,
less compressed, and more threadlike, by the wide separation in the
middle of the band of vomerine teeth, by a larger eye, by a greater
slope to the sides of the head, by a smaller dorsal, by the smaller
number of rays in the anal, and by the markings.” The largest of
Mr. Garman’s specimens was “less than 9 inches in length.” All
these characters the present writer has been able to confirm. Further-
more, the snout 1s more convex in front than in the Wels, the chin
barbels further from the symphysis than the foremost ones of the
Wels, and the opercle is smaller and especially shorter. Such char-
acters evidently indicate specific differences from the central Euro-
pean fish. Had Agassiz only added to his account one word, fowr-
barbeled, Felton would have been justified in his exclamation, made
after the communication of Agassiz:

It is a very striking fact, that the fish in question should, so many centuries
after the death of Aristotle, have come from the Achelous across the Atlantic to
this country, to furnish our associate with a commentary on the great phi-
losopher, and to vindicate his accuracy as an observer against the criticism
even of a Cuvier.

The single word “ four-barbeled ” would not only have demon-
strated (accuracy being conceded) that the Glanis was distinct from
the Silurus, but would have suggested to the well-informed ichthy-
ologist that its affinities might be with certain eastern species rather
than with the northern. The Glanis is, indeed, but distantly related
to the Wels of the north and is a near relative of several eastern
species. It is, in fact, the offspring of a successful invasion from
Persiawards and the Orient. Doubtless the renowned ichthyologist
appreciated and intended to have made known these facts, but post-
ponement included non-performance.

The history of the glanis is unique in the annals of ichthyology.
A more detailed account of its habits was given than of any
other fish by the greatest of ancient scientific authors, but the fish
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 44]

itself was lost sight of or confounded with another for more than a
score of centuries. Then it was reserved for a naturalist of a new
world to attempt to revive it, and to a follower of his still living to
establish it as a distinct species and to tell us what it really is.

The Glanis is so exceptionally interesting, as well as so little known,
that the other sections relating to it, as translated by Agassiz (with
a few alterations), are added herewith. It may be seen then how
much naturalists, as well as fishermen of classical Greece, knew about
at least one of her fishes.¢

The cordylus (a salamander) swims with its feet and its tail; and it has a
tail like the Glanis.—Aristotle, Hist. An., 1, 5, 3.

Of fishes that have gills, some have simple gills and some have double; but
the last, nearest the body, is in all cases simple. And some have few gills,
others have many, but all have an equal number on both sides. Those that
have the fewest have one on each side, but that double, as the capros; others
have two on each side, one simple, the other double, as the conger eel and the
searus; others have four simple ones on each side, as the elops, the synagris,
the murzena, and the eel; and others still have four, but in two lines, except
the last, as the kichle (crenilabrus?), the perke (perch), the Glanis, kyp-
rinos (carp?).—Ibid., II, 9, 4.

Of those belonging to the sea, and having lungs, the dolphin has no gall-blad-
der; but all birds and fishes have the gall-bladder, the egg-laying, the four-
footed, and, to speak generally, sometimes more, sometimes less. But some of
the fishes have it on the liver, as the Galeodes (sharks), the Glanis, the rhine
(angel fish), the leiobatos (a skate), the narke (torpedo); and of the long
fishes, the enchelys (eel), the belone (pipefish), and the zygzena (hammerheaded
shark ).—J/bid., II, 11, 7.

The river and lake fishes are exempt from pestilential disease, but some of
them have peculiar disorders, as the Glanis, which, about the time of the dog-
star, by reason of swimming on the surface, becomes sun-struck, and is stupe-
fied by loud thunder; and many glanides in shallow water perish by the bite of
snakes.—I/bid., VIII, 20, 12.

One passage relative to the Glanis has been overlooked by Agassiz
and is here translated from the original Greek :

River and pond fishes are best after spawning and milting, when they have
recovered their bodily vigor. Some are good during the spawning season, as
the saperdis; others bad, as the Glanis. The males of almost all species are
better than the females, but the female glanis is better than the male. (Aris-
totle, Hist., VIII, 29, 5.)

Notwithstanding the interest attaching to such a fish, no illustra-
tion of the Glanis has yet appeared, and undoubtedly the accompany-
ing portrait of one of the original types will be welcome to all. We
are indebted to the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and especially
Mr. Garman, for the specimen requisite to fill this desideratum
(fig 25).

aIt is of course to be understood that the deficiencies of information mani-
fest in some of the statements by Aristotle are not here made good.

449 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.
ICTALURINES OR NORTH AMERICAN CATFISHES.

All the North American catfishes are supposed to take care of their
eggs and young, but the belief may possibly not be realized, for
observation has confirmed the supposition only for two genera and
three species. The species observed are the common catfish of the
Middle States (Ameturus catus or albidus), the common Bullhead
or small catfish of the North (Ameturus nebulosus), and the channel
or blue catfish (/ctalurus punctatus). In view of the difference in
breeding habits between such closely related species as the wels of
central Europe and the Glanis of Greece, it is quite possible that
analogous differences may exist among the American catfishes.

The three American species whose habits are known are much alike
in such respects. The normal mature fishes, some time after they
have awakened from their winter rest and become invigorated, and
when their sexual products have become fully developed, seek mates
and pair. The time naturally varies with the temperature and con-

sequently the latitude, but in the neighborhood of Washington and
New York it may be in April, but apparently is mostly in June and
July. A subcircular or irregular area on a sandy or gravelly ground
is cleared in shallow water and more or less excavated. The cleared
or gravelly bed may serve as the place of deposit of eggs. :

The first time the present writer had an opportunity to observe cat-
fishes at close range during their breeding season was in July, 1883,
when Mr. (afterwards Prof.) John Ryder informed him that a pair
had oviposited and requested him to go to the Fish Commission
laboratory and examine them with him. The fishes proved to be of
the Ameturus catus (then called albidus) kind. On the morning of the
13th of July, a little after 10 o’clock, one of them had laid “ a mass of
whitish eggs ” and both parents were for a time near the eggs. Soon,
however, only “one of the individuals remained constantly over the
egos, agitating the water over them with its anal, ventral, and pecto-

=
ral fins;” the other, “after the eggs were laid, seemed to take no
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 443

further interest in them, the whole duty of renewing and forcing the
water through the mass of adherent ova devolving upon the ” other,
“who was most assiduous in this duty until the young had escaped
from the egg membranes.” During the week this incubation lasted
the writer daily visited the aquarium, but did not remain long. By
Ryder and the immediate attendant it “ was at first supposed ” that
the watcher was “the female,” but the writer contended that it was
‘rather the male. Ryder explained that “ on the 30th of June, or when
the young were seventeen days old, it was determined to make an ex-
amination of the internal organs of both parents, which was done in
ihe presence of Professor Gill, to learn which one of parent fishes it
was that had acted as nurse; ” it was found that it was the male.

Not only did the male alone act as guardian of the eggs, but on one
occasion during the writer’s observation, when the female approached
nearer than she was wont to do, the male advanced toward her and
vutted at her with. partly open mouth. Occasionally, however, the
female may cooperate with her mate, if we may trust to the observa-
tion of Hugh. M. Smith and L. G. Harron (1903) which were more
extended than Ryder’s or mine, and are worthy of reproduction.

During the entire hatching period both parents were incessant in their efforts
to prevent the smothering of the eggs, to keep them clean, and to guard against
intruders. The eggs were kept constantly agitated and aerated by a gentle
fanning motion of the lower fins, and foreign particles, either on the bottom
of the nest or floating near the eggs, were removed in the mouth or by the
fins. The most striking act in the care of the eggs was the sucking of the egg
mmasses into the mouth and the blowing of them out, this being repeated sev-
eral times with each cluster before another lot was treated.

The male was particularly active in watching for intruders, and savagely
attacked the hands of the attendant who brought food, and also rushed at
sticks or other objects introduced into the aquarium. Practically the entire
work of defense was assumed by the male, although the female occasionally
_participated.

During the time the fry was on the bottom the attentions of the parents
were unrelaxed and, in fact, were increased, for the tendency of the different
lots to become scattered had to be corrected, and the dense packing of the young
in the corners seemed to occasion much concern. The masses of fry were con-
stantly stirred, as the eggs had been, by a flirt of the fins, which often sent
dozens of them 3 or 4 inches upward, to fall back on the pile.

When the nest is completed, oviposition may take place at once
or be more or less delayed. In the case of Smith and Harron’s fishes

Two days intervened between the beginning of the nest making and the laying
of the eggs. As soon as the nest was made ready the fish became very quiet.
During most of the time they rested on the bottom, with practically no body
or fin movement, except at intervals. The fish lay close together, often
parallel, with their abdomens just clear of the bottom, their weight being
borne on the anal and ventrai fins. At frequent intervals the female compressed
her distended abdomen against the smooth slate bottom with a quivering or
convulsive movement, the male often accompanying or following the female
in this action, which is obviously for the purpose of loosening the eggs.
444 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

On July 5, between 10 and 11 a. m., the eggs were deposited in four separate
agglutinated masses on the clean slate bottom. Unfortunately the fish were
not under observation at this time, although they were watched for about
fifteen minutes after the extrusion of the first two lots of eggs, when it was
supposed the spawning had been completed. The masses of eggs were of
nearly uniform size, about 4 inches long, 24 inches wide, and half an inch thick.
The newly laid eggs are one-eighth of an inch in diameter, nearly transparent,
and of a pale yellow color. The number of eggs deposited was estimated
at 2,000. The incubatory period was five days in a mean water temperature
of 77° E., the lowest temperature being 75° and the highest 80°. About twelve-
hours intervened between the hatching of the first and last eggs. Active move-
ment was observed in the embryos forty hours after the eggs were laid. Fully
99 per cent of the eggs hatched into normal fry, a few weak and deformed
fry and a few unfertilized or dead eggs being noticed.

Smith and Harron entered into detailed observations respecting
the behavior of the male and female catfishes toward each other and
their nest making.

The nest-making, as modified by the artificial conditions of the aquarium,
consisted in removing all the stones and sand from one end and keeping the
slate bottom scrupulously clean from all foreign objects, even the smallest
particles of food, sediment, etc. In moying the pebbles, which were mostly
from one-half to three-fourths of an inch in diameter, the fish took a vertical
or slightly oblique position and sucked a pebble into the mouth, usually beyond
the lips and out of sight, then swam toward the other end of the tank and
dropped it by an explosive or blowing effort. Sometimes the gravels were
earried only a few inches and sometimes the entire length of the aquarium.
Usually the fish swam horizontally near the bottom when carrying a stone,
but sometimes turned obliquely upward and dropped it from near the surface.
Both fish participated in this operation. The removal of finer sediment was
effected by a quick lateral moyement of the body which caused a whirl that
lifted and floated the particles beyond the limits of the nest.

The pair of fish more particularly under consideration, during the first night
they were in the aquarium, removed all the gravel from over a space nearly
2 feet long and 14 feet wide, upward of a gallon of stone being transferred as
described. After the second pair of fish had cleared a similar space, a pint or
more of gravel was scattered on the nest; the fish immediately began to re-
move the stones, and in a few minutes had completely freed the nest from
gravel. The gravel—regarded by bass and other fishes as desirable material
for the bottom of nests—may be removed by the catfish for two reasons: (1)
To have a clean place for the eggs and young, so that they may be better
guarded, as hereafter described; (2) to provide a smooth place on which to
rest and against which to rub the abdomen. ;

All the observations thus far noticed were made on individuals
confined in aquaria and of the species A meturus catus or A. nebulosus.

The best account of the manner and location of nesting under
natural, or sometimes rather unnatural, conditions, has been given
by Albert C. Eyclesheimer, who had good opportunities to see the
common bullhead of the north (Ameturus nebulosus). The observa-
tions were made in June, 1896 and 1898, in Wisconsin and Michigan.
June 8, 1896, three nests were found in Fowler Lake, Wisconsin.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 445

Two of these were in pieces of stovepipe, the third in an old pail. The nests
were in clear water, near a bold, rocky shore, and at a depth of four or five feet :
all contained embryos and each was guarded by a parent fish—which one I did
not ascertain. On the following day, in searching for other nests, I raised a
small piece of tin pipe and was surprised to find a pair within. Though the
raising of the pipe they became so wedged that it was impossible for either to get
free. They had not yet begun spawning, although the eggs were so ripe that
they were easily extruded by slight pressure. [Artificial fertilization was tried
but was only partially successful.] A small percentage of the eggs segmented,
most of which died before the embryos appeared.

Two years later Eyclesheimer renewed his observations when
camped near Mud Lake, Michigan, which abounded in large bull-
heads, and thus tells of his experience:

An extended search was made on June 9, 10, and 11, and we had almost given
up the search when one of my companions found a nest in a small bay with
shallow sandy shoals. Soon a dozen or more were found along this sandy shoal
and in a depth of water not exceeding three or four inches. They were usually
concealed beneath logs, stumps, or boards, which lay against the bank. One
would often observe a slight depression, and upon turning the sheltering object
would find the pair engaged in spawning or watching over the freshly laid eggs.
446 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

In two nests which were found beneath logs on June 11, the parent fishes were
moving about in the small sheltered excavation. The eggs were removed in
each case; those of one lot were in early cleavage, while those in the other were
in late gastrula. Both nests were visited on the following day, but the fishes
were no longer present. Another nest, in which the eggs were in late gastrula-
tion stages, was uncovered and left exposed. When visited on the next morning
neither fish nor eggs were found.

While the nest is thus bravely guarded in many if not most cases,
it is not in all. In fact much individuality appears manifest in the
behavior of the fish toward the precious deposit whose care it assumes.
Professor Birge had the opportunity to see many individuals and has
given his impressions in excellent form:

There was a surprising difference in the disposition of the fishes on various
nests. One of them was extremely tame. If approached cautiously, he would
not swim off, and it was quite easy for me to put my hand under him and lift
him off the nest. He seemed to enjoy being scratched gently, and when lifted
off the eggs would remain where placed or would swim off a short distance,
and, in general, was very little disturbed by handling. Others were exceedingly
shy, so that as soon as one had approached within a few yards of them they would
dart off, throwing the eggs out of the nest as they went, with a jerk of the tail.
Of course they always came back and brought the eggs together again. But
this violent treatment of the bunch of eggs was apt to break it up, and If
observed that a considerable portion of the eggs was lost in such cases. One of
the catfish whose eggs were in a stump was particularly ferocious, and this
was the only one which I found that had a violent disposition. I found the
nest and put my hand down into the stump to take some of the eggs, when the
fish seized it and worried it with all his force. After that I found it necessary
to remove the eggs from this nest with a pair of long forceps, which the fish
would bite in spite of being rapped on the nose with them rather vigorously.
It was this difference in disposition that especially attracted my attention in
studying the catfish.

If disturbed on the nest, the actions of the parents are characteris-
tic. Eyclesheimer has recorded experiments on a pair:

It was interesting to watch the actions of the fish when the sheltering object
was removed. A fence rail covering a nesting pair was carefully turned, when
the fishes immediately sought its shelter. As it was turned farther and farther
from the nest they followed, keeping as well secluded as possible, the while
moving restlessly about in search of the nest. When the rail was finally lifted
from the water the male lingered for a few moments, then darted for deeper
water. The female approached the shore and began searching here and there
for her lost nest. This she passed several times without recognition, although
she seemed to know the surrounding landmarks, since she would go but a short
distance in either direction, then turning, would pass back to the locality of
the nest, which she found in a short time, and despite the fact that it was
unsheltered, she remained. On the following morning the nest was visited, but
again neither fish nor eggs were to be found.

It is not difficult to allure the fish to an improvised shelter. A number of
boards were placed on the shore with one end projecting into the shallow water.
The fishes sought these places and made their nests beneath the boards. It is
worthy of note that in no case did I observe more than a single nest beneath the
same cover, and this quite agrees with the pugnacious character of the fish.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. - 447

Paternal care is continued for many days after the birth of the
young. At first these may be crowded together in a dense mass,
but as time passes they disperse more and more and spread round
the father. Frequently, especially when the old one is feeding,
some—one or more—of the young are taken into the mouth, but they
are instinctively separated from the food and spit out. At last the
young swarm venture farther from their birthplace, or perhaps are
led away by their parent. Such a swarm may be occasionally no-
ticed by the visitor to a likely stream,and one such the present writer
saw in his youth as he was wandermg along the bank of the Rahway
River. Having read the paragraph by Goldsmith, to the effect that
no fishes exercise care over their progeny, he was quite unprepared
for such a manifestation of parental interest, and, indeed, it was
some time before he recognized the nature of the phenomenon. A
black cloud was apparent near the opposite bank, which was slowly
moving toward the middle of the stream. It was at first conjectured

Fig. 30.—Amieurus nebulosus, After Bean.

to be a lot of tadpoles, but as it approached a large catfish became
distinguishable in the midst of small, black wrigglers, which
were at last recognized as young catfishes. The swarm seemed te
revolve round the large fish, sometimes almost surrounding him and
then massed by the side. For more than an hour the slow movement
from the bank to midstream was observed, when other interests led
the youth away, and he left the swarm to itself.

The same swarming is practiced by the fish in an aquarium, as the
writer has observed. More prolonged observations were made and
recorded by Smith and Harron :

The very young fry were also taken into the mouths of the parents and blown
out, especially those which became separated from the main lot and were found
in the sand and sediment. The old fish would take in a mouthful of fry and
foreign particles, and retain them for a moment, and expel them with some force.
After the young began to swim and became separated, the parents continued to
suck them in and mouth them, and, as subsequently developed, did not always
blow them out. .
448 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

An interesting habit of the parents, more especially the male, observed dur-
ing the first few days after hatching was the mixing and stirring of the masses
of young by means of the barbels. With their chin on the bottom, the old fish
approached the corners where the fry were banked and, with the barbels all
directed forward and flexed where they touched the bottom, thoroughly agi-
tated the mass of fry, bringing the deepest individuals to the surface. This
act was usually repeated several times in quick succession. The care of the
young may be said to have ceased when they began to swim freely, although
the parents continued to show solicitude when the attendant approached the
aquarium from the rear.

The after fate of the brood is suggestive of some of the conditions
and accidents which beset the path of young fishes and indicates why
the number of adult fishes does not vary more from year to year in
spite of the immense number of eggs and progeny yielded by a
mother fish.

When 12 days old about 1,500 of the fry were removed from the aquarium
to relieve crowding, and placed in a hatching trough such as is employed for
salmon and trout. For some unknown cause, 1,000 of these died during the
first three days. The others survived with little or no loss, and are still on hand.

The fry which were left with their parents continued healthy, but their num-
ber steadily decreased. There being no way for them to escape, and a closely
woven wire screen preventing inroads from the exterior, it was suspected that
the old fish were eating their young, though they were liberally fed at suitable
intervals. They were kept under close abservation during the day, and were
seen to be fond of mouthing the fry, more especially the weaker ones—a _ habit
which at this stage seemed unnecessary. They were frequently seen to follow
leisurely a fry, suck it in their mouth, retain it for a while, and then expel it,
sometimes only to capture it again. There was no active pursuit of the fry,
and the tendency seemed to be to spit them out. In one or two instances,
however, it appeared that fry taken into the mouth were not liberated, the
feeding instinct becoming paramount to the parental instinet. After all the
fry which had been left with their parents had disappeared—in about six weeks
after hatching—18 from the trough were placed in the aquarium one evening,
and only 2 of these had survived on the following morning.

During the entire period covered by these observations liver and beef were
fed regularly to the brood fishes, and at no time did their appetites fail. There
was apparently no interference with deglutition, or closure of the cesophagus,
such as has been observed in some other catfishes, as half-inch cubes of meat
were readily ingested during the entire time the fish were under observation.

PIMELODINES, OR SOUTH AND MIDDLE AMERICAN CATFISHES.

Much like the North American catfishes are most of those of South
and Middle America, but they have only six barbels instead of eight,
the missing ones being the nasal; as in the Ameiurines, however,
their nostrils are remote and not close together as in the Tachisurines.

The attitude of the parents to the young among the Pimelodines is
unknown in most cases, but it is probably analogous to that prevalent
among the North American fishes. There is, however, a remarkable
deviation from the latter and doubtless from its relatives of the sub-
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 449

family exemplified in one case, the common bagre of Yucatan. Mr.
Kk. W. Nelson obtained specimens of the fish so named in Yucatan,
and it was later found by Evermann and Goldsborough that the spe-
cles was unknown, and they consequently described it as new (in

Fic. 81.—The Bagre of Yucatan (Conorhynechos nelsonii). After Evermann and
Goldsborough.

1902), calling it Conorhynchos nelsonii. The accompanying figure
will give an idea of what it looks like. It reaches a length of a foot
to 18 inches. Two of the males obtained by Nelson had eggs in their
mouths, one 16 inches long having no less than 89 well-developed
ones, and the other a single one.

SALT-WATER CATFISHES, OR TACHISURINES.

While most of the catfishes are inhabitants of the fresh water, a
few have accommodated themselves to life in the sea, and among
such are the Tachisurines or Ariines, mostly called
sea catfishes. The chief of these are slender, grace
ful fishes, with comparatively small, bony, granu-
lated head and six barbels; the anterior and poste-
rior nostrils are close together. What is especially
remarkable, however, is the fact that of most spe- aiiigy
cies the female lays large eggs the size of a small ric. 32.—The Bagre
marble which, after fecundation, are taken by a Se het ee
male into his mouth and kept there until they are — afterEyermann and
hatched. While such is the case for most species,  G°!“sPereush-
however, it is not so for all, for several are said to oviposit on the
ground and leave the eggs there to be cared for by the males, while
one (Galeichthys or Hexanematichthys felis) has been declared to
be ovoviviparous; this is the most northern of these fishes and occa-
sionally wanders up to Cape Cod.

THE EGG CARRIERS.
When the breeding season has arrived the female gives evidence
of it by an increased fullness of the belly, which is the result of the
enlurgement of maturing or matured eggs. The ovaries are in a
450 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

nearly symmetrical pair, and eggs are existent or developed in about
three sets. According to Wyman, the eggs “ are arranged in three
zones corresponding to three successive broods, and probably to be
discharged in three successive years. In the female of one species,
18 inches long, the mature eggs measured “ three-fourths of an inch in
diameter ” and those of the second zone ‘ one-fourth,” while those
of the third were very minute—*‘ about one-sixteenth of an inch.”
Turner found in an Indian fish that the largest eggs were about as
large as “ grapes or small cherries,” those of the second series * like
medium-sized shot,” and the smallest “like minute granules.” The
size of the eges varies more or less with the species and perhaps with
the average size of the species. Those of the common large bagre of the
Argentine Republic (Netuma barbus or commersoni7)” have a diam-
eter of 17 or 18 millimeters (three-fourths of an inch).

The number of mature eggs differs considerably, but, as would
naturally be expected, are never in large number, as fishes’ eggs go.
Wyman found “ between twenty and thirty ” in the mouth of each
male he observed, Turner found twelve in one of his females,
while in the mouth of one male he found ten and from that of an-
other “ thirteen were shaken out.” In the opinion of Turner, and
apparently of Wyman, “a close relation exists between the number
of eggs which come to maturity at a given time and the number
which the male can carry in his mouth.”

According to Day, however, “in the’ female organs of generation
the eggs seem to come to maturity in batches of perhaps fifty at a
time,” but he * found many males of the genus ” Arius or Tachisurus,
“and also of Osteogeniosus, with from fifteen to twenty eggs in their
mouths.” This concatenation certainly requires verification. Doubt-
less the number of eggs matured varies with size as well as species.

It may be also that the number of eggs in the mouth of a male may
be no certain criterion of the number in a given female. Wyman,
for instance, “in the mass of eggs with which the mouth ” was filled,
“occasionally found the eggs, rarely more than one or two, of an-
other species.” The only way, he thought, in which the presence of
the exceptional eggs could be accounted for “is by the supposition
that while feeding the eggs are disgorged, and as these fishes are
gregarious in their habits, when the ova are recovered the stray egg
of another species may be introduced into the mouth among those
which naturally belong there.” It is, however, improbable that the
male feeds while the eggs are being hatched or that he disgorges
them.

In some cases, at least, special provision appears to be made by the
female to receive the emitted eggs. Day found, “ on examining the

a Arius commersonii of most authors.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 451

conformation of the ventral fins, those of the females appeared to be
larger than those of the males;” further, “these rays were thick-
ened by a deposit of fat, while the innermost one had a large pad
attached to its posterior edge.” He therefore assumed that ‘* these
fins can be expanded into a cuplike surface, the use of which may be
io receive the eggs as extruded, which may be vivified there by the
male.”

As soon as the eggs are extruded by the female and fertilized, they
are taken by a male, but whether from the ventral pouch improvised
by the female or from the open water is unknown. In the mouth
they are probably retained until they are hatched and the fry pre-
pared to take care of themselves. The interior of the mouth is
capacious and the oral cavity separated from the stomach by the
esophagus, which exercises the function of a sphincter and confines
the eggs and fry to the cavity. Wyman, however, found “in one
instance, besides some nearly mature foetuses contained in the mouth,
two or three were squeezed apparently from the stomach, but not
bearing any marks of
violence or of the ac-
tion of the gastric
Juice.” Wyman nat-
urally assumed that fz
“it is probable that
these found their way
into that last cavity
after death in conse-
quence of the relaxa-
tion of the sphincter, which separates the cavities of the mouth and
the stomach.”

The number of eggs carried by the males varies between eight or
ten and forty or fifty. Wyman found between twenty and thirty.
“The mouth and branchial cavity were very much distended, round-
ing out and distorting the whole hyoid and branchiostegal region.
Some of the eggs even partially protruded from the mouth ” in one
of Wyman’s fishes. But, with the exception just noted, “no young
or eggs were found in the stomach, although the mouth was crammed
to its fullest capacity.”

The length of time during which the eggs are retained within the
mouth is unknown, but it must be considerable. Before the period
of oviposition both males and females in India “are said to be so
fat that the curry made with them resembles that made with pork;
but after swimming about for a few days with their mouths full of
eggs,” the males become, according to Boake, “dry and insipid.”
Eventually they may become quite emaciated. Boake thought that
the ovigerous stage lasted for “a period of some weeks.” Perhaps

452 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

the best evidence as to the ovigerous period has been furnished by
the Netuma barbus or commersonii, a species very abundant in south-
ern Brazil, where it is known as the bagre. H. von Ihering (1889)
tells that in the Rio Grande do Sul the spawning season is the late
spring and summer—that is, during November, December, and Jan-
uary. The eggs of this species, by the way, have been declared to be
the largest of any known Teleost, being about three-fourths of an
meh (17 or 18 millimeters) in diameter.

But, although most of the Tachisurines are probably oral egg car-
riers, all are not so, one making a peculiar kind of nest and another
being declared to be viviparous.

A FRESH-WATER TACHISURINE.

The northern Australian fish generally known as Arius australis,
but which some modern systematists would call HWexanematichthys
australis, 1s a nest
maker, but makes a
nest different from
those prepared by the
glanis and the Ameri-
can catfishes.

The species is an in-
habitant of the Hunter
River, Richmond Riv-
er, and the Boyne, and
it was in the last that
Semon found it in
abundance and __ first
noticed its nesting hab-
its. By the English
colonists it is called
jewfish, and by the
native blacks _ bolla.
Inasmuch as jewfish is
better known in con-
nection with several
other fishes, bolla may
be advantageously
used. The fish has
the general appear-
ance of the familiar
sea catfishes and slender fresh-water catfishes of America, but the
upper surface of the head or casque from the interorbital region
backward is thickly sprinkled with fine bead-like granulations.

Fie. 34.—The bolla (Hexanematichthys australis). After Gtinther.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 453

The color is uniform blackish above and silvery on the sides. It
reaches a size of about 18 inches. Its nesting peculiarities have been
described by Richard Semon in his work entitled * In the Australian
Bush ” (1899, p. 196).

The bolla was found by Semon to resort to “ flat, sandy, and stony
parts ” of the river, “ under a rapidly passing current,” to spawn. In
such places, in August—that is, in early spring in northern Austra-
lia—Semon “ found numerous light-colored circles of about a yard
across.” On looking more closely he “ often noticed a fish swimming
about inside this ring, and, as it seemed, occupied with a work of im-
portance. On examining the ring itself, which has a breadth of about
elght inches,” he found that its hght color was * due to the removal of
all stones, large and small, from its surface. They had been carefully
carried into the inner circle, so that the surrounding ring shows the
gleaming white sand of the river bed, bare of every pebble. The ring
shows no other peculiarity. The inner circle,” however, excited his
interest. At the top he found several layers of big stones, among
which nothing was to be discovered. These were succeeded by a mix-
ture of small pebbles and coarse river sand, beneath which followed
the common river ground. At first Semon was unable to find eggs in
any of these layers, though he closely examined them. Observation
through the rapidly flowing water was, however, far from easy, and
being sure that this was the depository of the eggs, he further investi-
gated the matter. He took out a part of the gravel, cleaned it from
sand by passing it through a strainer, and thus found numerous small
egos—small in comparison with the eggs of the egg carriers, but large
in comparison with those of most fishes. They had a diameter of
about one-eighth of an inch, and were surrounded by a “ closely fit-
ting tegument.”

The manner in which the nest thus observed is made has been
explained at length by Semon:

When depositing its eggs and building its nest, the fish goes to work in the
following way. It begins by preparing a bedding about half a yard in area,
consisting of gravel and small pebbles, among which it deposits the spawn,
which is instantly milted by the male. After this it covers up the eggs by sey-
eral layers of bigger stones, thereby preventing them from being washed away
by the stream or being carried off by water-birds fond of this kind of caviare
or by marauding little fishes. The material for this defensive structure is derived
from the above-mentioned ring, which thereby becomes devoid of all stones and
gleams brightly in its smooth garb of white sand. It is wonderful to observe
the accuracy of the fish’s handiwork and the perfect circle described by the
ring. So far as I could see, the fish moved the bigger stones by pushing them
along with its tail.

The whole affair shows a very clever arrangement, the eggs thus being well
shielded from enemies, well ventilated by the current and even protected against
being mud-stifled (Save in case of a downright flood).
454 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.
SUPPOSED VIVIPAROUS CATFISHES.

Besides the two modes of care for the progeny already noticed, it
has been claimed that there is a third kind of provision for the young
by at least one of the American Tachisurines. Evermann and Bar-
ton Bean, during a visit to the so-called Indian River of Florida in
1896, ““ were convinced ” that the sea catfish, known as Galeichthys
felis, “is ovoviviparous.” They urge that, “ according to the testi-
mony of competent observers among the Indian River fishermen and
dealers, the adult females of this catfish are found filled with well-
developed young in March, each rolled up in a ball and the balls
connected in a long string.” In the opinion of Evermann and Golds-
borough (1902), “ while the technical description is a trifle faulty,
the evidence points very strongly toward the ovoviviparity of the sea
catfish.”

It is possible, however. that the “ Indian river fishermen and deal-

ers” confused the contents of the abdomen and the mouth. Certain
it is that males of the Galeichthys or Hexanematichthys felis carry
eggs within their mouths.

Another supposed viviparous catfish is an inhabitant of South
American rivers. It is the lau-lau, declared by R. H. Schomburgk
to be, “ next to the pirarucu, the largest fresh-water fish of Guiana.”
It is, according to that author (Fishes of British Guiana, I, 194),
“remarkable that the young of the lau-lau are excluded from the
ovarium into the abdomen, in which state they might be likened to
the yolk of an egg, in which the two specks of the eyes, the mouth,
and fins, are, however, observable. If a lau-lau should be taken when
near parturition, in consequence of fear the eggs pass off.” A Mr.
Hillhouse “ assured ” Schomburgk that “he had repeatedly put the
eggs In a glass of water, where they hatched themselves, and the young
appeared with a large vellow protuberance on its belly like the abdo-
men of a chicken just hatched. When left to nature, the eggs are
hatched in the abdomen; and when the young are excluded, they

the mother opens her mouth, and the fry find a safe retreat in the
thorax

If this statement could be relied on, viviparity would be proved,
but it is at least possible that the observers, seeing the eggs out, as-
sumed that what had really come from the mouth had issued from
the abdomen.* Anyway, fry that had found their way from the
mouth into “the thorax ” would not find it “a safe retreat.” The
species has not been described or illustrated in such a manner as to
be intelligible. Mr. C. Tate Regan, of the British Museum (7n //tt.),
thinks that “the lau-lau seems to be an Arius,” possibly it is the
Netuma barbus. Another possibility is that it is related to or the
same as the gigantic piraiba of the Amazons (Piratinga filamentosa).
One objection to the last suggestion is that the flesh of the lau-lau
is said to be “ delicious, both in the fresh state and when dried; ” in
fact, the “ flesh is so much esteemed, that it is considered to be one
of the ties which binds him who has once tasted it forever to the
region where it is indigenous.” On the other hand, the flesh of the
piraiba, is indigestible and even dangerous; in the words of its
monographer, E. Goldi (1901, 183), “a carne do Piraibi é tida por
pesada, indigesta, perigosa mesmo com a continuacaio.” As British
Guiana belongs to a nation endowed with scientific investigators, we
may hope soon to know what the lau-lau really is.

The Plotosids, or catfishes, of southern Australia have been also
claimed to be viviparous and they at least make provision for the
eare of their young. In the report of the Royal Commission to ex-
amine into the fisheries of New South Wales, it is asserted that in “ the
fresh-water catfish ” (Copidoglanis tandanus), “as in most if not all
of the Silurida, the ova are fertilized by the male fish before leaving
the body of the female, and both sexes seem to unite in the subsequent
attendance on the nest in which the ova are deposited.” The intro-
mission of the semen among Silurids will be new to ichthyologists
and physiologists.

In fine, while it may be improbable that there is viviparity in
Silurids, it is not impossible, and these popular beliefs should lead
to a candid investigation of the subject.

SILURINES, ICTALURINES, PIMELODINES, AND TACHISURINES

All the fishes now referred to are related to such a degree as to
form a group called the family of Silurids by naturalists. It is the
largest and most comprehensive family of the order of Nematognaths,

about eight hundred species being known. ‘The form is more or less

elongated and the trunk naked, at most plates existing only along the
lateral line. The head is either naked in some or shielded in others,
but with the opercular apparatus well developed. The mouth is
normal and has simple lips; maxillary barbels are conspicuous;
the dorsal fin, when developed, is near the head and has a spine, but
in some is atrophied or entirely suppressed. Coincident with these
are certain osteological characters which reenforce the family value
of the group.

The European species belong to the subfamily of Silurines, which
are distinguished by the great length of the tail and anal fin and the
advanced position of the anus as well as the small or atrophied dorsal
fin; there is no adipose fin. The species are confined to the Old
World and are numerous in Asiatic and African rivers.

The North American species represent another subfamily—Ictalu-
rines—distinguished by the moderate length of the tail and anal fin,
the submedian position of the anus, the well-developed dorsal fin and
spine, and the presence of an adipose or fatty fin along the back of
the tail; the barbels are eight in number, the usual maxillary and
chin being supplemented by a pair of small ones close behind the
hinder nostrils; further the two pairs of nostrils are quite far apart;
the palate is toothless. Catfishes of this kind are nearly confined to
North America, few species extending into Central America and
northeastern Asia. Between thirty and forty occur in the streams
-and lakes of America.

The South American and most of the Mexican species are closely
related to the North American, and have the same form and fins, but
there are only six barbels, the nasal being absent; as in them, however,
the anterior and posterior pairs of nostrils are far apart.

The marine catfishes, designated as Tachisurines or Ariines, differ
very little from the preceding, having essentially the same from and
proportions as well as fins, but the two pairs of nostrils are close
together, there are no nasal barbels, and the palate is armed with small
and densely crowded teeth. Numerous species inhabit tropical seas
near the land, and a few enter fresh-water streams.

All these are closely related and thus may be brought together in
this connection. Another subfamily is more distant.

€
THE DORADINES OF SOUTH AMERICA.

Next may be noticed South American Silurids (Doradines), espe-
cially distinguishable superficially by the existence of a single row of
plates along the sides, and thus separated from the other groups of
the family to which they belong as well as from the Callichthyids,
with which they are often confounded by the natives of the countries
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 457

both inhabit, the Callichthyids having two rows of plates interlock-
ing along the lateral line. The Doradines have also the branchial
apertures separated below by a wide isthmus and the gill apertures
correspondingly narrowed. The true dorsal fin is well developed;
the anal fin is short; the air bladder is free in the abdominal cavity.
One of the species of this group—the flathead hassar (Doras han-
cockii) —has long been celebrated from the account of John Hancock
(1828) as “ one of those fishes which possess the singular property of
deserting the water, and travelling overland. In those terrestrial ex-
cursions large droves of the species are frequently met with during
very dry seasons, for it is only at such periods that they are com-
pelled to this dangerous march, which exposes them as a prey to so
many and such various enemies. When the water is leaving the

pools in which they commonly reside, the yarrow ” (a Species of Lry-
thrinus, probably EF. uniteniatus) and the roundhead hassar (/Hop-
losternum littorale) “ bury themselves in the mud, while all the other
fishes perish for want of their natural element or are picked up by
rapacious birds, ete. The flathead hassars, on the contrary, simulta-
neously quit the place and march overland in search of water, travel-
ling for a whole night, as is asserted by the Indians, in search of their
object.” Hancock, by experiments, ascertained that “ they will live
many hours out of water, even when exposed to the sun’s rays.”
This endurance is promoted by the narrowed gill apertures and the
closeness with which the gill covers can be pressed to the sides. They
have also, according to Jobert, a development of sanguiferous papille
to the intestinal canal serving for aerial respiration analogous to that
noticed in Callichthyids, but less complete.
SM 1905——33
458 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

Long ago Hancock described the movement of the flatheaded has-
sar of Demerara (Doras hancockii). A friend informed him that on
one occasion he and his family “ fell in with a drove of these animals,
which were on their march over land to a branch of the Pomeroon.
They were so numerous that the negroes filled several baskets with
those they picked up.” Their movements “over land” have been
compared to those of “the two-footed lizard. They project them-
selves forward on their long arms (the stout pectoral spines) by the
elastic spring of the tail exerted sideways. Their progress is nearly
as fast as a man will leisurely walk. The strong scuta or bands
which envelop their body must greatly facilitate their march,” Han-
cock thought, “in the manner of the plates under the belly of ser-
pents, which are raised and depressed by a voluntary power, in some
measure performing the office of feet.”

Jnder ordinary conditions, the flathead, according to Hancock,
“ frequents only the fresh water of pools, lakes, and rivers, lives by
suction, and on aquatic insects, and grows to about a foot in length.”

No details of the courtship and parental care of any Doradine have
been published. All that is known is what Hancock (1828) has told.
“ Both ” of the species of Nematognaths which he noticed as “ species —
of hassar ”—the Doras and Hoplosternum—* make a regular nest; ”
the nest of the Doras is made “ of leaves” while that of the oplo-
sternum is made “ of grass; ” the eggs are laid “ in a flattened cluster,”
and covered “ over most carefully.” Like the roundhead, the flat-
heads “ lay their eggs only in wet weather.” Afterwards the parents
are said to “ remain by the side of the nest till the spawn is hatched.”
Tt has been especially asserted that * both the male and female ” share
in guarding the nest, “ steadily hatching the spawn and courageously
attacking any assailant.”

THE RAAD OR ELECTRIC CATFISH.

Almost all the members of the Nematognath order have stout dor-
sal and pectoral spines, but the electrical catfish, like other electrical
fishes, is entirely deprived of spines or dermal armature of any kind;
its electrical battery replaces all such protective devices and is more
than a compensatory substitute. The family Malapteruride@ has
been proposed for it. The body and head are entirely naked and
unarmed, the mouth is terminal, the barbels are like those of the
typical catfishes, a true dorsal fin is wanting but there is a large adi-
pose on the back of the tail far behind, the pectorals are lateral and
unarmed, and the ventrals submedian. |

«The proper name of Malapteruridxe is Torpedinidse. (See Proc. U. 8. Nat.

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 459

The electrical or electric catfish is the only generally recognized
species of the family, although several nominal species have been
proposed from time to time. Another name by which it is known is
raad, raa-ard, or raada. This name, by which it is generally known
to the Arab fishermen of Egypt, means thunder, and thus the natives
have connected the fish with the phenomenon coincident with the
effect which Europeans indicate in the name (electric catfish) which
they have given. Raad is an excellent name, and that will be used
here.

The raad is indeed especially noteworthy on account of the remark-
able development of the electrical apparatus and function. An indi-
vidual no longer than a hand’s length can give quite a disagreeable
shock, as the present writer can testify from personal experience.
“ Both the director and some of the keepers, having received strong
electrical shocks from comparatively small” fishes in the aquaria of
the Egyptian Zoological Gardens, cared not “to experience how
powerful a shock the large fish could give.”

Fic. 37.—Raad or electric catfish (Malapterurus electricus). After Boulenger.

In the words of Fritsch (1893), the raad or J/alapterurus belongs
“to quite a different category from other electric fishes.” “A trans-
verse section of the whole fish shows the difference at once. The body
of the animal is enveloped in a very thick electric skin, constituting
one electric organ. Muscular tissue is nowhere deficient, other histo-
logical elements must therefore have furnished the material for the
electric plates, which are packed very close in the lozenge-shaped com-
partments of the skin.”

In more detail, Francis Gotch (in 1899) explained the structure of
the electrical organ:

It is situated in the skin enclosing the whole body of the fish, and has a beau-
tiful and characteristic appearance when seen in microscopic sections. Hach
organ consists of rows of compartments, and each compartment has slung
athwart it a peculiar protoplasmic disc shaped like a peltate leaf, with a project-
ing stalk on its caudalside. Nerves enter each compartment, and end, according
to the recent work of Ballowitz, in the stalk of each disc. By these nerves
neryous impulses can reach the organ; the arrival of such impulses at the
nerve terminations evokes a state of activity which is associated with the devel-
opment of electromotive charges of considerable intensity constituting the organ
shock. The shock is an intense current traversing the whole organ from head to
460 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

tail and returning through the surroundings; it stuns small fish in the neigh-
borhood and can be felt by man, when the hand is placed near the fish, as a
smart shock reaching up the arms to the shoulders.

The seeker for further information may find ?t in the article on
* The electric fish of the Nile,” by Professor Gotch, in the Proceed-
ings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain for March 17, 1899
(vol. 16, pp. 114-115).

The raad has a wide range through Africa and occurs not only in
the Nile, but in the other great rivers, the Kongo and the Niger,
besides many smaller intervening streams.

In a state of nature the raad attains a considerable length, excep-
tionally as much as 3 feet, but is mature and capable of reproduction
when less than a foot long. According to Forbes, individuals in con-
fined quarters or captivity scarcely ever grow; “ most” of those in
the Liverpool Museum—about 6 or 7 inches long—have rarely,
though in excellent health, grown much after their arrival.” The
largest the present writer saw in an aquarium in Liverpool was less
than 8 inches long. In the aquaria of the Egyptian Zoological
Gardens, however, the director reported (1905, p. 27) that specimens
“increased in length and girth during their stay in captivity.” One
which died in February, 1905, had attained a length of 174 inches
and a weight of over 3 pounds (3.2 pounds), after having lived nearly
two years (since April, 1903) in the aquarium.

A number of good observations were made on individuals living in
the Liverpool Museum, by Dr. H. O. Forbes, and published in the
Bulletin (1, pp. 25, 26). These we freely draw upon. For the most
time and “ when in good health the raad lies sluggishly on the bot-
tom, rising to the surface only for the purpose of feeding or when in
expectation of beimg fed.” Those in the Egyptian aquarium “ ap-
pear to spend nearly the whole day lying motionless on the bottom
of the tank, from time to time flapping their pectoral fins.” In cap-
tivity in Liverpool they “ thrive well on and take with avidity com-
mon earthworms, boiled liver chopped up, and occasionally a young
trout from two to three inches in length.” Its power of vision is very
hmited, although it has “ small, sparkling, diamond-point-like eyes,”
but their optic nerves are “ extremely attenuated,” when compared
with those of “ other fishes of corresponding size.” Its behavior in
being fed is characteristic.

If a worm be dropped into the tank to fall wriggling to the bottom, the J/a-
lapterurus rarely, if ever, sees it. A few moments, however, after the worm
has fallen through the water, the fish becomes suddenly agitated, apparently
through its olfactory organ, or, perhaps, by its barbels detecting the undula-
tions communicated to the water; and begins turning rapidly about with tensely
extended and vibrating barbels, keenly quartering out the tank in quest of the
quarry, whose presence it has become sensible of. The sought-for object is,
however, as a rule, discovered without its coming into actual contact with the
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 461

fish’s tactile oral fringe. The worm, once discovered, disappears in a flash down
the catfish’s throat by suction and is usually not seen again, although some-
limes it is brought up to be partially masticated. On the other hand, the pres-
ence of a young trout in the tank is not, it would seem, detected in the same way,
or so quickly as a worm or a fragment of liver. It more often discovers itself
to the Malapterurus, by coming in contact with its body, when {t is instantly
partially disabled by an electric discharge, and pounced upon, when it likewise
disappears in the same manner as the worm.

Another of their characteristics adverted to by Forbes is a spirit
of pugnacity carried to an extreme which renders their assemblage
im an aquarium dangerous to some of the individuals and require
them “ to be kept isolated in separate tanks.” The individuals in the
aquaria of the Egyptian Zoological Gardens were comparatively
peaceable. According to the director (1905, p. 27), * besides the two
Malapteruri ” kept in one tank were “several ‘ boltiy 7iapia nilo-
tica,” and “neither species of fish appears to in any way interfere
with the other.” According to Forbes:

Although supposed to be immune to each other’s electrical discharges, the fol-
lowing observation would seem to throw some doubt on whether this be really
the case. On one occasion the partition between two halves of a tank, each
containing a MWalapterurus, becoming faulty, two strong and healthy fishes
managed to get together, and were found by night watchman on his hourly
rounds, fighting with each other. Adjusting the partition, he returned the com-
batants to their separate cells. On his return, however, an hour later he
found the barrier had again slipped, and both fishes were in the same com-
partment, but one was dead. On examination no external marks of violence
were visible, and we can only suppose that the stronger fish had killed its
neighbor by a powerful electrical shock.

The raad is apt to kill off other fishes of corresponding size that
encroach on its territory, although this is not always the case. It may
also make use of them in a way which reminds one of the attacks of
jegers on gulls and their consequences. One was confined in an
aquarium in Liverpool with a Clariid catfish; it would not eat worms
offered to it directly, but after the Clariid had taken them, it would
give its companion a shock which had the result of causing him to
vomit the worms recently taken, and these the raad would appropriate
for his own use with an open countenance.

Sounds, described as being “ not unlike the hissing of a cat,” were
heard to issue from a raad in captivity by a sister of William Séren-
sen, when staying at Mansourah on the Nile. ‘This appeared some-
what strange” to Sérensen, but after he had dissected the fish, he
“could easily account for it by the long, narrow ducts through which
the air has to pass from the anterior to the posterior chamber of the
air bladder ” (1895).

The manner of reproduction of the raad is still unknown. The
eggs are rather large, having a diameter of a couple of millimeters,
462 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

but it is not known when or how they are laid. The fishermen of the
Nile assert that the fry are carried im the mouth of a parent.

Naturatly a fish possessed of such remarkable attributes as the raad
attracts general attention, and must be at least tolerably well known
to most of the inhabitants of the country in whose waters it dwells.
‘Phe species was known to the ancient Egyptians, and, according to
Gotch, it was delineated on the interior walls of Ti, estimated to have
lived five thousand years before the Christian era.

It was doubtless used as a remedial agent from early times. An
Arabian physician of the twelfth century described the effects pro-
duced by the fish. It was described likewise in a couple of chapters
in 1625 in “ Purchas, his Pilgrimes” (pp. 1183, 1545), under the
name of torpedo. Its electrical power is made use of for sanitary
and invigorating purposes by the African natives, who share with
many of their European brethren the belief that electricity has
peculiar efficacy and restorative virtues. A child may be put into a
tub containing a raad and kept for a time in spite of its yells and
eries, by the mother, who sacrifices her tenderness of feeling to the
desire for the welfare of her offspring.

Not all the natives in the country of the electric catfishes are fa-
miliar with or know of their power. Ignorance is sometimes dis-
played where it would be least expected. One of the party of a
Belgian official in the Kongo State on one occasion played a practical
joke on his “ chef; ” a good-sized fish was caught and carried alive
to the Kongo chef; he took it and, knife in hand, prepared to skin
it, but as soon as his knife touched the skin the man experienced a
shoek which evoked shrieks of amazement and pain and hurled him
to the ground, where he remained prone and bewildered for some
time.

THE CALLICHTHYIDS.

Related to the Silurids, but forming a peculiar family, is a group
of fishes restricted to tropical America; it is that of the Callich-
thyids.

The Hassars or Cascaduras, otherwise denominated the Callich-
thyids, have a superficial resemblance to the catfishes, but are distin-
guished from them, as well as from.all other fishes, by a peculiar coat
of mail composed of lateral rows of narrow vertically extended
plates, two rows on each side, which interlock along the lateral line
and cover completely the sides. The head has a special system of
plates, and the operculum is well developed; the mouth is inferior
and small and the intermaxillary bones much reduced in size; the
lower lip is everted; the maxillary barbels doubled; the dorsal fin 1s
anterior and has a strong spine, and a spine also fronts the adipose fin ;
a PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 463

the pectorals are low and horizontal and also spiniferous. From
tropical American streams about 30 species have been obtained.

The typical Callichthyids of the genera Callichthys and Hoploster-
num are most at home in streams with a muddy bottom and in the
shallow ditches and pools of marshes. In such places they may con-
gregate in considerable numbers, and when the water is low may be
readily caught with dippers or pails and even with the hand. When
so disturbed they are apt to express their feelings by rumbling or
grunting sounds. At all times they may come to the surface of the
water from time to time to take in gulps of atmospheric air, and
these emergences become more frequent with the lowering of the
water. At length, if the water entirely disappears, the resort to
atmospheric air supplants aquatic respiration, and a curious comple-
mentary mode of respiration is substituted for the normal branchial
method. This was discovered by a French physiologist—Professor
Jobert—who visited Brazil in 1877 and 1878 and undertook some in-

Fic. 38.—Hoplosternum littorale. After Boulenger.

vestigations at the instance of the Emperor. These were favorably
reported on by a special committee of the French Academy of
Sciences of which Milne Edwards was the mouthpiece.

Like the common loach of Europe, according to the reporter, the
typical Callichthyid “ frequently swallows bubbles of air, partly ab-
sorbs the oxygen from them by the walls of its digestive tube, and by the
same course excretes carbonic-acid gas, which is afterwards evacuated
by the anus mixed with the unabsorbed nitrogen.” There is, in fact,
“a complementary respiration analogous to the pulmonary respira-
tion of the terrestrial vertebrates, but having its seat in the intestinal
eanal.” Jobert also “ ascertained that in the Callichthys this tube
presents in its anatomical structure peculiarities in connection with
this exceptional function.” In “the sublaminal portion of the in-
testine ” are developed a “ multitude of filiform appendages arranged
in tufts on the free surface of the mucous membrane and composed
essentially of blood vessels.” It is these “ sanguiferous appendages
of the intestinal coat of Callichthys” that “ serve to maintain an ac-
464 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

cessory aerial respiration in these aquatic animals.” The atmospheric
air is “introduced by deglutition into their digestive tube, traverses
that canal throughout its whole length, and, after escaping by the
anus, produces a sort of continual bubbling in the water.” The
bubbles thus evacuated contain “a large proportion of carbonic
acid,” and are “ naturally less rich in oxygen than atmospheric air.”
By “studying anatomically the vascular tufts which clothe the walls

Fic. 39.—Hoplosternum peclorale. After Boulenger.

of the intestine in which the air, in passing, loses oxygen and _ be-
comes charged with carbonic acid, M. Jobert ascertained that many
of these sanguiferous appendages originate from adjacent veins, in
the same way as the afferent vessels of a lung.”

The habits of two species of very different genera—Hoplosternum
and Corydoras—have been made known. The chief of these, at least
so far as size and economical importance are concerned, 1s Hop-
losternum. This comprises fishes with a broad head high-arched
above and separated from the antedorsal plate by the intervention of
two nuchal plates, and the plates behind the head (ccenosteons or
proscapulas) are broad and continued downward to the breast, where

the pair are separated by a narrow naked area. There are more
characters differciutiating the genus from others, but those given are
sufficient to distinguish it from its nearest relative, Callichthys, the
name-giving genus of the family. Four species of Hoplosternum
are known, the most northern being the 77. /ittorale, which extends
from Trinidad and Guiana to the Rio Plata.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 465

The most generally known English name for any species of Hoplo-
sternum is Hassar, which, however, it shares with very different
species of the family of Silurids—the Doradines. The etymology
and origin of this name is unknown. In the great New English
Dictionary (Murray’s) it is supposed to be of South American origin
(“ ?native South American name”), but this is doubtless a mere sup-
position based on the fact that it is current in a South American
country (Demerara). According to John Hancock (1828) it is
derived from the “Arowaks.” Another name having some currency
in English is one that may be often heard in the British island of
Trinidad. In that island the common species is generally known
as the Cascadura, which is a survival from the time of the Spanish
dominance in that island. This has been translated as “ hardhead,”
but it evidently refers to the segmented or articulated appearance
produced by the two rows of high and narrow plates which cover the
sides, the Spanish word Cascadura meaning “an act of bursting or
breaking asunder.” The same fish is also
called que que by the negroes of Demerara, 1n
imitation of the noise it makes when taken out
of the water, which, it is considered, ‘* much
resembles the cry of a rat.

The roundhead hassar (/Toplosternum litto-
role) was supposed by Hancock to remain and
bury itself in the mud of the pool which was
drying up, and he especially stated that it was __

i : Fie. 41.—Hoplosternum pec-

noe known to attempt such excursions ” as the: ~ ‘oraic, showing armature
flathead hassar resorted to, “ although it is cap- Shree fue eo
able of living a long time out of its element.” a.
A close relative of the roundhead, however, the cambota of southern
Brazil (Callichthys asper), was the subject of interesting observations
by an American resident in Bahia, Mr. Joseph Mawson. He had
s1x specimens of the fish and kept them mostly “in a narrow-necked
tin of water, with some sand and mandioca meal at the bottom, for
five days,” and they continued “active and vigorous.” Mawson’s
specimens were not full grown, measuring only 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10
centimeters) long. Occasionally he let them out of the receptacle,
and once one got out without assistance. Mawson’s account was
published in Science for December 25, 1880 (I, p. 317), and is worthy
of partial republication here, especially as it has entirely escaped the
notice of all ichthyologists.

I have had them out in the garden several times. I find that they move best
on smooth damp ground, and are embarrassed by sticks or other inequalities.
They can jump a little vertically, but their progress on land is effected entirely
by a quick wriggling motion of the body, which is nearly flat upon the ground.
The paired fins (pectorals and ventrals) are extended laterally and seem to bear

‘
466 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

little if any weight, but they move slightly and appear to serve to steady the
body.

On one occasion an individual displayed much activity and gave
Mawson a good opportunity to observe its peculiar movements.

Last night I heard a peculiar sound, and on looking around I saw one of the
fish travelling about the room. He had escaped from the tin which was in my
bedroom, had fallen from the table to the floor, and travelled along the corridor,
about 12 meters (about 40 feet) to the sala. I watched him travelling for
two hours, during which time I estimate that he moved at least 90 meters.
‘Toward the end of the two hours he seemed to flag a little, but in the earlier
part his method and speed were fairly seen. He seemed to start with a sudden
movement of the head or the barbels, then wriggled briskly for 5 or 10
seconds, advancing about a meter. Then he would rest for about 10 seconds,
and start as before. This was kept up during the whole two hours, and I
left him still moving. This morning, five hours later, I found him dead. While
he was moving I spilled some water on the floor, but he crossed it; hence IL
concluded that it was mud rather than water of which he was in search. The
fish are eaten and considered good food.

Many of the hassars bury themselves in the mud as the stream in
which they have lived dries up and are able to survive quite a pro-
tracted dry period, reviving when the rains again fill the depressions
with water.

The roundheaded hassar of Demerara (/Zoplosternum littorale) 1s
one of the earliest fishes whose nest-building habits have been. de*
scribed. When it was generally asserted by naturalists that “no
fishes are known to take any care of their offspring,” from far-off
Demerara John Hancock, an English surgeon resident in that colony
during the second quarter of the last century, in 1829 sent “ Notes on
some species of fishes and reptiles,” and among them were observa-
tions on fresh-water fishes which he called hassars—one kind, the
flathead, a Doras, and another, the roundhead, the Hoplosternum
littorale. The latter was claimed to assiduously guard its eggs and
young. The sexes, it was asserted, cooperate and make a regular nest,
formed of grass, in which “ they lay their eggs in a flattened cluster,
and cover them over most carefully.”

According to Hancock, too, “they lay their eggs only in wet
weather.” He had been “ surprised to observe the sudden appearance
of numerous nests in a morning after rain” had occurred, “ the spot
being indicated by a bunch of froth, which appears on the surface of
the water, over the nest; below this are the eggs, placed on a bunch of
fallen leaves or grass,” which the fishes “cut and collect together.
By what means this is effected,” he continued, “seems rather mys-
terious, as the species are destitute of cutting teeth. It may possibly
be by the use of their serrated arms, which form the first ray of the
pectoral fins.”

The nest building was later (in 1886) described by Captain Vipan,
who observed the same species in Trinidad. He had a pair confined
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 467

in an aquarium; and they commenced to make a nest in June. One
begun on June 6 and another on June 9 * they soon pulled to pieces.
On the night of the 11th they began a new one. It consisted of pieces
of Valisneria, all the leaves of the Vymphwa that were growing in
the tank, which they bit off close to the roots of the plants, and a
great quantity of river moss (/ontinalis antipyretica), each piece be-
ing two or three times the size of the fish, so that they must have had
hard work to bring them to the surface. They worked these ma-
terials together by some mucous substance until the outside was hard.
the whole being under a quarter of an inch thick. They next buoyed
up the structure with a quantity of mucous foam until it was raised
34 inches above the water. The whole nest was 9 inches long and 7
inches wide, and somewhat resembled a finger glass turned upside
down on the top of the water, with the interior filled with froth.”

The process of oviposition is especially interesting and is essentially
the same as in a distant relative—the Corydoras—which otherwise
differs much in habits. According to Vipan, the fish kept swimming
close under the nest, “all the time on their backs, and filling it with
foam. When finished, on the 12th, the female shed her spawn be-
tween her ventral fins, which were clasped tight together, and when
full swam to the nest, and, turning on her back, deposited the spawn
‘nit. This occurred several times, the male each time putting the
spawn in its proper place and covering it with froth.”

The subsequent behavior of the pair must either vary considerably
or one of the observers must have assumed more than was justifiable.

After the nest is made the female deposits her eggs in it. Then.
according to Hancock, she stays about it and shares with her mate
the care of it. The two, says he, “remain by the side of the nest till
the spawn is hatched with as much solicitude as a hen guards her
eggs, both the male and female hassar—for they are monogamous—
steadily watching the spawn and courageously attacking any assail-
ant.” This devotion is often taken unfair advantage of by the
negroes and the fishes are caught by them “by putting their hands
into the water close to the nest, on agitating which the male hassar
springs furiously at them and is thus captured.”

Captain Vipan’s account 1s more consistent with the facts known
respecting the care of the nests by other fishes by the father fish only.
According to him, “as soon as the female had dropped all her spawn
the male took entire possession of the nest and would not let his mate
go anywhere near it, and treated her so badly that ” he “ had to place
her in another tank to save her life. Unfortunately the spawn was
not good, only a few eggs hatching and the young fishes dying soon
afterwards.”

The only other Callichthyid whose breeding habits have been
described is a species of the genus Corydoras. This has been estab-

give striking evidence of it. The males assemble in groups of three
to five and, to use the expression of Carbonnier, disport themselves
in quite a feverish manner (“maniere toute febrile”) and apparently
practice a kind of mutual excitation. All this time the female

agitates her barbels and lips and courts the attentions of the males.
Excited at length by their own actions as well as those of the female,
the males dart toward her, some pressing against her sides and wildly
disporting themselves there, and others on her back. At length one
of the males may stride across the female’s head and seize her barbels
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 469

by the bony spines with which the pectorals are armed. Then he
hugs her vigorously, and without letting go slides around to the lower
surface of her head. In this position he forcibly emits his milt along
the abdomen of the female. The female is ready. As soon as she
had been seized by the male she had brought together her two ventral
fins and by their expansion formed behind the ovarian outlet a cavity
or sort of bag in which the eggs and sperm are to be received. Very
soon afterwards a few eggs are expelled and held in the extem-
porized receptacle and then fructified by the spermatozoa already
lodged there. The set of eggs has about five or six, and these the
female holds for some minutes in the pouch just noticed. Then she
goes in search of a place to deposit her eggs. Her choice generally is
a well cleared area, perhaps a stone projecting out of the water. She
clears with her mouth a spot at least four or six inches (ten or fifteen
centimeters) below the level of the water; then applying her abdomen
to the spot she opens her pouch, parting the ventrals, and fixes her
eggs, which become attached by the viscosity which envelops them.
All the eggs being thus disposed of, she again approaches the males,
and the same procedure is gone through with forty or fifty times in the
course of a day. The number of eggs thus provided for is about
250. As polyandry is indulged in by the female, it is not likely that
any provision except that just noticed is made for the later care
cf the eggs by either male or female.

The absence of a special nest is also vouched for by Captain Vipan,
who, in 1886, wrote that he had “bred great quantities” of the
Corydoras punctatus * from the Amazons, but they never made the
slightest attempt at making a nest, always depositing their spawn
all over the tank and even on the floating thermometer kept in it.”

In the island of Trinidad, where species of three genera live, the
largest of the Callichthyids, called cascadura (/oplosternum Titto-
vale), 1s so highly esteemed that a proverbial expression has arisen—
“ He who eats a cascadura will die in the island.”* The ambiguous
phrase is interpreted to mean that if one goes away he will return to
satisfy his appetite for the fish. The present writer has not been
affected in that manner. He could not appreciate much, if any,
superiority over the best of the common American catfishes. In other
places than Trinidad, too, the fish appears to be highly regarded.
Hancock wrote of the Demerara fish that “ the flesh of this hassar is
yellow, firm, and very savory. especially esteemed by the creoles in
their soups,” whose composition is described by him at length.

snout, and has large everted lips; the barbels are inconspicuous; the
dorsal is anterior; the pectorals are inserted low down and on a level
with the inferior surface of the breast, and the dorsal and pectoral
fins have marginal spines; the ventrals are more anterior in position
-than in other Nematognaths. An adipose fin is generally represented
by a thin membranous ridge with a spinelet in front, but in many
genera is wanting, and, indeed, it has been found in one species to be
of so little significance as to be present in some individuals and absent
in others. Such are the most noteworthy external characteristics,
but those of most fundamental importance are deeper seated and to
be found in the skull and the vertebral column. It would, however,
entail too much technical knowledge to appreciate them. Anyone
who wishes to ascertain what they are may do so by consulting “A
monograph of the fishes of the family Loricaride,” by C. Tate
Regan, published in 1904 in the Transactions of the Zoological
Society of London. The illustrations, as well as the text, are un-
usually good.

The Loricariids are peculiar to tropical America, and about two
hundred species have been already obtained and described. They are
more interesting to the naturalist than the general student and have
little or no economical value. Very little is known of thei habits.
They are bottom fishes, living chiefly, but not only, in streams with a
muddy or sandy bed and at moderate depths.

Marked sexual differences are frequent in the species of Loricarids.
Regan (1904), indeed, has aptly indicated that “the differences be-
tween the sexes in certain genera are very remarkable.” The dif-
ferentiation is generally in the direction of increased spinescence or
the development of stronger spines and bristles in the males than in
the females. It is also noteworthy that an increase of size appears
to be generally correlated with the assumption of the secondary male
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. ATL

characters. This larger size of the male than the female is, in fact,
the rule among fishes when the male is distinguished by salient charac-
ters, such as increase of armature or brillianey of coloration. (See
p- +09.)

Practically nothing exact is known respecting the breeding habits
of any of the species of the family, but doubtless they will be found to
be of extreme interest if we may credit the ideas of Prof. Louis
Agassiz. That eminent naturalist, during his ichthyological explora-
tion of the Amazon in 1865, made certain observations which should
stir up naturalists of tropical America, where species of the genera so
abound, to make diligent hunt for them during the breeding season.
According to Agassiz, some of the Loricariw carry their eggs in folds
of their everted lps, while others, of the genera Plecostomus or
Hypostomus, actually sit upon their eggs like birds. These state-
ments were made in a letter to Milne Edwards from Manaos, Brazil,
and published in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles (5. ser., Zool., t.
5, p. 228). Agassiz’s exact words are: “ D’autres espéces portent leurs
ceufs dans les plis de leurs lévres, telles sont les Loricaires; d’autres
jes couvent comme les Oiseaux, tels sont les Hypostomes.” It is prob-
able that the Hypostomes or Plecostomes, like the American catfishes,
may really rest upon or close to their eggs for a time, but frequently
rise above to fan and agitate them to give them the benefit of fresh
air.

No further information was published by Agassiz respecting the
oviposition or embryology of any Loriecariid. Only an incidental
reference to the rearing of the young of Syngnathids is given in his
Journey in Brazil (1868, p. 239), and the remark is added that “ it is
only matched by the equally curious incubation of the eggs in Lori-
caria.” ¥. Steindachner, however, in 1881, in his description of the
Loricaria spixii, noticed the great development of the hinder or
lower lip, especially in the male during the breeding season, and the

underside of the head.¢

Typical specimens of the Loricaria spixii in the Vienna Museum
were reexamined by Friedr. Siebenrock in 1903, and he informed
Mr. Regan that Steindachner’s “statement was based only on the
structure of the lip, which seems adapted for such a purpose,” but

that none of the specimens in the Vienna Museum show eggs in this
position. Siebenrock and Regan were apparently not aware of the
fact that Agassiz had made the statements already quoted in this
article. Even if eggs had been found as indicated, however, they
might have become accidentally lodged there. We may repeat, then,
that practically nothing exact is known respecting the breeding
habits of any species.

has been given in the volume on fishes of “ Brehm’s Tierleben,”
(1879, p. 206; 1892, p. 243), and that special reference to the same
species as a remarkable nest builder has been made by Dr. R. Semon
in his “ Zoologische Forschungsreisen in Australien und dem Malay-
ischen Archipel” (II, 1895, p. 273), as well as “In the Australian
Bush,” ete. (p. 196).

The account in the “ Tierleben,” however, is due to some confusion
on the part of the compiler and is in no way descriptive of a Lori-
earlid. The names * Chatostomus pictus, Callichthys und Ancistrus
pictus ” are associated in Brehm’s Tierleben with a diagnosis partly
referable to the fish named Chetostomus pictus by Giinther and
partly to the one called Callichthys pictus by Miiller and Troschel.
The description of the nest is entirely derived from Schomburgk’s
notice * given in connection with the Callichthys pictus, etc. The two
fishes have nothing in common but the name pictus and belong to
entirely different families; the former, now named /emiéancistrus
brachyurus, 1s a Loricariid, and the latter (/Zoplosternum Uttorale)
a Callichthyid, whose habits have been noticed in the present article
in the proper place.

When an able naturalist like Semon is misled by a popular work,
such as Brehm’s, it is time to correct the mistake. It may be added
that in the first edition (V, p. 637) the paragraphs copied (with
alterations) from Schomburgk’s work are rightly associated with
Callichthys (“ pictus”), but in the second (VIII, p. 206) as well as
third edition (VIII, p. 243) they are given under the head of Chetos-
tomus pictus.

forepart of the back are much depressed; the usual. opercular bones
are present, but rudimentary; the mouth is inferior; the intermaxil-
lary bones are remarkable for being placed in a longitudinal instead
of transverse direction; the unarmed dorsal is far forward; the pec-
torals are horizontal and each armed with a very strong spine. Only
a couple of dozen of species are known. A special interest attaches to
species of this family on account of the very peculiar care taken of
their eggs by some of the species at least.

In all the other Nematognaths, so far as known, the care of eggs
and young is devolved chiefly if not entirely on the male parent, but
those Aspredinids whose gestation is known (and that of four species
is) act quite differently and in a very remarkable manner.

As long ago as the eighteenth century representatives of the family
had been described with small globular bodies pendant from the
breast and those were supposed to be distinctive of a species named
therefore Aspredo cotylephorus; their function was unknown and
not even guessed at. Not until nearly a century later were they recog-
nized as eges.

Even the great and learned ichthyologist Valenciennes had no con-
ception of their true nature. As late as 1842, in his chapter on the
genus Aspredo, he wrote as follows:

A certain number of individuals in each species (of Aspredo) are remark-
able for singular appendages on the underside of the thorax and abdomen,
and which, after the few observations which I have been able to make, appear
to indicate a certain state of the female. I have not seen them in the males and

biG. 54.—Aspredo filamentosus. After Valenciennes.

the females do not have them at all times. They first appear as pores on the
under and naked surface of the trunk; and these enlarge and swell into tuber-
cles, which subsequently elongate into filaments, and the extremity of each
filament is dilated into a small cupule.¢

It was in this state that Bloch saw them in an individual with six cirrhi, and,
taking them for specific characters, named the fish Platystacus cotylophorus.
But I have seen the same appendages in three species. Artedi, in the text of

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. A475

Seba, had already described two species, to which we now add a third. All
three live in the waters of Guiana and this is all we know of their habits.¢

Not until years later did Prof. Jeffries Wyman, of Harvard Col-
lege, give a true explanation of the cause of such excrescences. In an
able article in the American Journal of Arts and Sciences he re-
viewed the history of opinion and, after giving the description of
Valenciennes, remarked that—

From the preceding paragraphs it does not appear that Valenciennes had
supposed that the so-called “ cupules”’ were intended to contain or had con-
tained ova, especially as he had previously expressed the belief that the Aspre-
dos, in consequence of the large size of the eggs, were viviparous. The true
use of the appendages in question relates to the development of the eggs, as
the following description will show. The habits of
the fish are well known to the fishermen, from one of
whom Mr. Green obtained information with regard
to their peculiar mode of gestation. After many in-
effectual efforts we at last succeeded in procuring
the specimens on which the following observations
were made, and Mr. Green has kindly presented to
me some very fine ones from his own collection, with-
out which this notice would have been much less
complete.?

In the month of June the eggs are found adhering
to the underside of the body, to the ventral and pec-
toral fins, and extend as far forward as the under
lip and as far backward as the middle of the tail
[fig. 55]. In some, however, the distribution is much
more limited. I was unable to learn anything with
regard to the transfer of the ova from the genital
orifice to the point of their attachment. The only
organ which seems in any way adapted to such a
purpose is the slender and flexible tail terminated
by a delicate caudal fin. It is possible that the eggs
may be deposited on the bottom of the river and sub-
sequently attached by pressing the underside of the  Fia. 55.—Aspredo levis, female-

body upon them with eggs attached to under,
: side.

In those individuals where the ova were still in the
ovary, but approaching maturity, the integuments of the underside of the body
gave no other indications of the changes about to take place than of being quite
vascular. The skin was perfectly smooth, no ‘ pores” were visible, but a large
vessel was seen emerging from the region of the liver, and descending along the
median line gave off branches quite freely to the integuments. This may have
some relation to the future development of the pedicles which support the eggs
and perhaps to the nutrition of the embryo as will be adyverted to hereafter.

In all the specimens which I have had an opportunity of examining, the
eggs were either somewhat advanced or quite mature, so that no observations

could be made on the earlier conditions of the egg and the formation of its
pedicle. The pedicle is a fiexible outgrowth from the common integuments,
is about two lines in length, is attached to the skin by a slightly expanded
base, and spreads out at its summit into a shallow cup or “ cupule,” for the
support of the egg. It is composed almost entirely of fibrous tissue, invested
with a layer of tesselated epithelium. In some instances when the eggs were
but little advanced, numerous fusiform cells were detected among the fibers.
It is vascular, two or three vessels reaching to the cup, where they ramify
and form a somewhat extended capillary plexus | figs. 56 and 57].

The eggs vary according to the degree of development from
0.09 to 0.15 of an inch in diameter, and are covered with an
external homogeneous membrane, containing minute puncti-
form depressions—within this is a second, of a brownish color
and composed of epithelium. The embryos which were the
most advanced and just ready to hatch, had not as yet com-
pletely absorbed the yolk, and were coiled up within the mem-
branes, which in consequence of the irregularities of the mass
i Rae formed by the embryo had no longer a spherical form.

absorption.

The relation of the embryo to the parent in this singular mode of gestation
can not be determined yery accurately, but the vascular plexus in the cup
seems to be more than is necessary for the mere nutrition of the part. The egg
increases in size during incubation, those ova in which development had but
slightly advanced measuring from 0.09 to 0.11 of an inch in
diameter, while those nearly mature measured from 0.14 to
0.15 of an inch. How this increase of size of the embryo over
the original size of the egg is actually obtained I have no facts
to show, but either of two suppositions is probable; it may
be by absorption of materials from the water which surrounds
it, or from the capillary plexus of the pedicles, and in this case
in a manner analogous to that of Pipa.

Even now nothing is known of the mating or court-
ship of the fishes. ~Various attempts have been made
to explain, however; the latest and most probable ex-
planation was published by Vaillant in 1898. The eggs,

for the time bemmg. - The adhesion of the eggs to the skin is analogous
to the mode of oviposition of the celebrated Surinam toad, but in that
animal attachment of the eggs is made to the back.

Nothing is known of the subsequent behavior of the mother or chil-
dren, and of course not of the embryology.

THE SCYPHOPHORES.

In Africa, but in tropical and subtropical Africa alone, are found
numerous species which have a peculiar physiognomy by which they
can be at once recognized and which have anatomical characters that
contrast with those of all other fishes. The most important of their
characters are shared in common with the normal Malacopterygians,
and therefore they may be placed in the same order; but the distine-
tive characters are sufficiently important to have led some ichthyolo-
gists to differentiate them as a suborder, which has been named Scy-
phophori, or, in English, Seyphophores.

The Sceyphophores are Malacopterygians with a deep cavity on
each side of the cranium between the squamosal, epiotic, and exoc-
cipital bones, which is covered in a lidlike way by a thin scalelike
supratemporal bone; without an opisthotic and without a symplectic,
and with the premaxillaries united. The brain is remarkably devel-
oped. Furthermore, the opercular and other bones are concealed by
the skin, the branchial apertures are narrow and lateral (being in
front of or above the level of the pectoral fins), and the jaws are not
protractile. These characteristics impart the physiognomy distinc-
tive of all the group. The species of the group are very unequally
divided by structural characters, a single species being contrasted
with all the others. The single species is the type of the family of
Gymnarchids, while all the rest belong to the family of Mormyrids.

The brain of the Scyphophores is extraordinarily developed and
superficially very unhke that of any other fish. Some of the older
anatomists thought the cerebrum was like a mammal’s. When
divested of its most salient peculiarities, however, it has “ very
nearly the same structure as in ordinary Teleostean fishes.” The
chief distinction is the development of “an immensely developed
tuberosity of a rounded shape immediately above the medulla ob-
Jongata and behind the cerebellum,” which “appears as a new develop-
ment superadded to the usual elements of the Teleostean brain,”
and which was designated in 1882 by Sanders as the “ tuberculum
impar.” Another peculiarity is the development of “a fungoid
erowth taking place from the region in front of the cerebellum;
we may then imagine this growth to burst through the tecta lobi
478 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

optic, forcing them asunder, repressing them to the basal part of
the brain, and then to spread out in all directions, covering over and
concealing every one of the remaining portions of the brain.” So
Sanders explains the structures in question. With these exceptions
“the other parts of the brain have very nearly the same structure as
in the ordinary Teleostean fishes.”

The Mormyrids are interesting for another reason: They are of
the number of electric fishes. On each side of the tail are peculiar
muscle-lhke structures which were named “ pseudo-electric ” long
ago, and which the researches of modern physiologists, especially
Babuchin and Gustay Fritsch, have demonstrated to be real electric
organs. These organs are in the form of oblique bands (like the
muscular segments from which they are derived), composed of small
columns perpendicular to their axis. They have little efficiency
compared with the electric apparatus of the electric catfishes, but
they are electric all the same, and they are developed to such an

Fic. 58.—Petrocephalus- bane, After Geoffroy Saint Hiliare.

extent as to largely replace muscles. Fritsch, in 1893, demonstrated
that “a transverse section of the tail of Mormyrus shows no con-
spicuous muscles, but in place of them electric tissue filling up the
entire. space occupied by muscles in ordinary fishes. Of the mus-
cular apparatus there is nothing left except the longitudinal tendons
passing outside the electric organs from muscles placed anteriorly.
If these tendons were cut across the Mormyrus would be unable to
move its tail.”

THE MORMYRIDS.

The Mormyrids are numerous, about 120 species having already
been discovered in the fresh waters of the “dark continent.” A
caudal fin is always manifest and the vertebrz are in moderate num-
ber—387 to 64. An imperfect electrical apparatus is developed from
the caudal muscles. The species vary much in the form of the snout

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. A479

and the extent of the dorsal and anal fins. The osteological and
cerebral variation is also great and the differences between the
ordinary forms (Mormyrines) and the genus Petrocephalus are
so many as to have led to the isolation of the last as a distinct
subfamily type. Representatives of the Mormyrines occurring in
the Nile were reverenced by the ancient Egyptians, and various myths
were connected with them.

There is a great range of size in the family, and even rather
closely related species may represent extremes. For example, the
largest of the family (Jormyrops deliciosus)
sometimes becomes five feet long, while a con-
gener of the same fauna (Jormyrops parvus)
may be sexually mature when less than five inches
long.

The food of the Mormyrids naturally is deter-
mined by the means for obtaining it. Those with
a relatively large mouth are able to secure fishes
and moderate-sized crustaceans; those with mouths
of reduced size are limited mainly to small crus-
taceans and worms and the larvee of insects, supplemented by decay-
ing animal and vegetable matter and some live plants. Boulenger
thinks that the species with prolonged snouts make use of them to
pry out animaleules which have found refuge between stones or
which have buried themselves in the mud, and that the fleshy ap-
pendage at the tip of the lower jaw is a tactile organ by means of
which they are assisted in finding their food. Some, indeed, seem

to prefer decomposing matter, and among such is the J/ormyrops
deliciosus, which Delhez declared affected putrifying animals in the
midst of the water weeds where they occur in large numbers;
especially did they congregate in the neighborhood of encampments,
where refuse matter of all kinds was dumped into the water. But that
very species exercised a rather wide range of choice, for Peters and
Boulenger found in stomachs the remains of fishes and crustaceans.
The longest, if not the best known, of the Mormyrids is the Cas-
chive (Mormyrus caschive) of the Nile, which, however, is by no

means confined to that river, but also occurs in the Gaboon and
Kongo. Caschive is the familiar name in use among the dwellers
along the lower Nile, although it is hkewise apphed by them to other
species of the genus. In ancient times it was known to the Greeks
as the Oxyrhynchus, and numerous representations of it and related

Fic. 61.—Gnathonemus labiatus. After Geoffroy Saint Hilaire.

The species of so large and diversiform a family must naturally
show considerable differences in habits, and especially in the selection
of “stations” or grounds, and little is known about any. Several,
however, have been confined in aquaria at the Egyptian Zoological
Gardens. and some data about them have been published in their
reports for 1903-1905. Some (Jormyrus kannume) “ spend the day
lying quietly on the bottom; ” others (G@nathonemus isidori) “ spend
most of their time in midwater, with all their fins and tails in per-
petual motion, but occasionally, for a short time, they will lie on the

bottom of the tank with fins motionless.” Still others (Gnathonemus
cyprinoides) “usually keep moving about the bottom of the tank,
the pectoral and tail fins being almost constantly in motion, the
other fins being only occasionally used.” The kannume, or abu boos,
and Gnathonemus have “a curious habit of swimming backward,
with tail leading,” a habit which reminds one of the Gymnarchus.
“Like the Gnathonemus,” the kannume prefers “the lower part of
their tank; the pectoral and tail fins are moved most, but there seems
less of the constant waving of fins about this species than there is
with the other two ” Mormyrids noticed here.

Some of the Mormyrids, especially the kannume, are quite pug-
nacious. Those in the Egyptian Zoological Gardens * fight a great
deal among themselves, and several individuals which died from
time to time during 1903, it is believed, had been killed by their
comrades, but latterly these fights have been less frequent.” They
still continued, however, during 1905,
and five were killed in the last year.

All the Mormyrids in the Giza gar-
dens were fed on “finely chopped-up
earth worms,” which they soon learned
to look for daily. After mghtfall the
kannume especially becomes “ very ac- \.
tive, searching energetically for food. — Fic. €3—Hyperopisus bebe. Front view.
When the light from a match or lamp rcpamee a eames
falls on them, their eyes shine very remarkably, sometimes white,
sometimes gleaming red.”

The Mormyrids appear to be mostly more or less nocturnal in a
state of nature, but in captivity most of them soon learn to feed by
daylight. The representatives of the Wormyrops anguilloides, how-
ever, “are of very retiring habits, and spend most of the day hidden
under the rock work of the tank, only coming out to feed at dusk.”
“Tt is interesting to see” the kannume “ searching the bottom of the
tank, examining every stone and cavity with their long snouts, for the
pieces of chopped-up earthworms which are daily put in for them to
feed on.”

They are by no means tenacious of life, but die quickly after being
taken from the water, and Fritsch had great difficulty in keeping
them alive long enough for
his experiments with them.
In fact, he could not keep
them over more than two or

three days at most.

The nesting habits of a Ssh
supposed to be a species of the
family (Hyperopisus bebe)
were observed by J. S. Budgett
in 1900. The parent scoops out

a swamp, laying bare rootlets

the eggs are attached. , The eggs are shghtly oval and small, being
about 14 millimeters in diameter and of a yellowish color but semi-
transparent; they are hatched in about four days. The embryos

the top of the head and two smaller ones on the front of the head.”
Just as soon as “the larva is hatched it rams the upper part of its
head against rootlets and, wriggling away again, draws out from the
four cement glands four fine threads of viscid mucus, which are har-
dened by contact with the water and form a minute rope about the
length of the body of the larva. By this the larva hangs suspended
for four or five days until the yolk is absorbed. If the larva is de-
tached meanwhile, a fresh rope is fermed by a fresh secretion of mucus.
While hanging thus, each

and one, although a foul feeder, was named J/ormyrops deliciosus on
account of the great esteem in which it was held. And, by the way, it
is the largest of its family, sometimes reaching a length of even 5 feet.
Such a fish, we learn from Boulenger, might command a price of 25
francs ($5) at Boma. — It is fished for chiefly at dawn and sunset.

Such are the only facts yet known respecting the breeding habits
of any of the Mormyrids.". In view of the specialized provision for
the care of the eggs in the bebe as well as in its distant relative repre-
senting the family of Gymnarchids, it is reasonable to assume that
care for the eggs may be exercised by most, if not all, the species of the
family.

THE GYMNARCHIDS.

The Gymnarchids are closely related to the Mormyrids, but the tail
tapers to the end and has no fin; the anal fin is also wanting (whence
the name), and the vertebra are very numerous (about 120). A
single species—Gymnarchus niloticus—was long well known as an
inhabitant of the White Nile, but in recent times has also been found
in the Senegal and Niger, as well as Lake Chad.

41 am by no means convinced that Budgett was correct in his identification of
the larval fish figured as the “larva cf Hyperopisus bebe” (in pl. 11, fig. 10)
with that fish; it is too unlike that of Gymnarchus.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 483

The gymnarchus or suyo*of the Gambian natives manifests peculi-
arities in movement in accordance with its peculiarities of form and
structure. “It propels itself through the water, not by the action of
its paired fins, not by the motion of the tail or the undulatory motion
of the axis of the body, but entirely by the action of its dorsal fin.”
When the fish starts forward, “the motion is the result of a series
of waves passing backward along the dorsal fin. About five such

Fic, 66.—Gymnarchus niloticus. After Boulenger.

waves are passing at a time. Suddenly the fish will proceed at the
same rate in the opposite direction, and now the motion is the result
of a series of waves passing forward along the dorsal fin. As the
gymnarchus swims rapidly backward in this way it may be seen to
guide itself through the grasses by using as a feeler this peculiar tail
which it possesses. Thus it appears to be quite immaterial to the

fish which way it progresses, and it always appears to swim in com-
paratively straight lines.” . .

The gymnarchus makes a large floating oblong nest, about 2 feet
long and 1 foot wide on the outside, in‘the dense grasses of a swamp
and in water 3 to 4 feet deep. In one, especially described by
Budgett, “three sides of the nest projected from the water; the

fourth side was several inches lower, being about two inches below the
surface. The deepest part of the nest was opposite to that side where
the wall was low, the bottom being about six inches below the surface
of the water.” Such were the typical nests observed by Budgett.
Tn one nest “ were deposited about a thousand spherical amber-like
eges 10 millimeters in diameter. The eggs hatched five days after
being laid, and in eighteen days a thousand young fry,” about three
inches long, left the nest. They were then essentially like the
adults. Many of the
young were secured by

ing that the parent is at

this time extremely fierce and has a very formidable bite.”
THE OSTEOGLOSSOIDEANS.

In the fresh waters of various tropical countries are found certain
fishes which have a general resemblance to some of the ganoids of
old times, and one of them, at least, has a complexity of the lower
jaw which is only paralleled by such ganoids as the Amiids and
Lepidosteids. The group containing such forms has been designated
as a peculiar superfamily—Osteoglossoideans.

The body is elongated and covered with a system: of hard scales

resembling mosaic work; the head is externally bony and sculptured,
and the parietals intervene between the frontals and supraoccipital.
By some naturalists three families have been recognized for such
fishes, but they are generally united under one—Osteoglosside. All
agree in having the intermaxillaries paired and in the possession of
well-developed interopercles and subopercles, and thus differ from
their nearest relatives, the dwarfed Pantodontids of Africa. The
life histories of these forms are little known, but two of the represent-
atives of the group have been ascertained to be care takers of eggs
and young, and very interesting details have been made known of

one of them.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 485
THE ARAPAIMA.

The most gigantic fresh-water fish—of America, at least—is that
best known as the pirarucu and arapaima. Scientifically it has been
most aptly named Arapaima gigas, and it is the only species of its
genus, as well as family. In addition to the characters already
noted, which it shares with other Osteoglossoideans, it has the belly
rounded and not keeled, the dorsal longer than the anal, the ventrals

far behind, postorbitals excessively differentiated and extremely
tong, and numerous (about sixteen) branchiostegal rays. These
characters, of inconsiderable importance by themselves, are the super-
ficial concomitants of important osteological peculiarities which
would necessitate too much technical detail for the present article.

dontide, and Phractolemide,” by W. G. Ridewood, in the Journal
of the Linnean Society for 1895 (vol. 29, pp. 252-282, pl. 30-32).

The pirarucu is knowif by this name, according to Castelnau,
among all the tribes which live along the Amazon. The name is said
to be a Guarani word meaning red fish. Arapaima is also a native
name.

The pirarucu is unquestionably the largest fresh-water fish of
America, if not of the world, as has been claimed. It has, according
486 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. ,

to Castelnau, a medium length of about 8 feet (2.50 meters), and
one of that size is said to weigh about 330 pounds (150 kilograms).
Occasionally, however, a much greater size is attained. Schomburgk
“was assured by the inhabitants of the Rio Negro that they have
caught some 15 feet long and of 12 to 13 arrobas (410 pounds)
weight.” These accounts are obviously discrepant. If a fish 8 feet
Jong weighs 330 pounds, one 15 feet long, having the same pro-
portions, would weigh nearly, if not quite, a ton. Undoubtedly
Castelnau exaggerated the weight of a fish 8 feet long; Sechomburgk
more nearly approximated the truth by attributing to a fish “6 to 7
feet ” long a weight of “not less than 150 pounds.”

The natives claim that the motherv takes charge of the eggs and
watches over them with great care, protecting them especially against
the male, who seeks to devour them. “The young,” it is further as-

Fie. 71.—The Pirarucu (Arapaima gigas). Wead enlarged. After Valenciennes.

serted, “are protected by the mother for some time after they leave
the eggs,” and they “swim generally over her head.”

Both Castelnau and Schomburgk record this belief of the natives,
but it is probable they were misled by preconceived notions and
knowledge of what birds do. It is likely (but not absolutely certain)
that the male takes charge of the eggs, as in the case of most fishes.

The pirarucu was ascertained by Agassiz (1868) to be “ found
almost everywhere ” in the Amazon Valley and to be “ the most 1m-
portant fish of the river, that which, as food, corresponds to cattle
for the population along the banks.” Castelnau records (1855) that
its flesh, supplemented by that of the manatee, serves to feed the
numerous “ nations ” of that part of the world. Essentially the same
conditions persist to the present time. ‘ When fresh it is excellent,
and the belly nearly all fat,” and it is the belly that is held in great-
est esteem. It is not alone as a fresh fish, however, that it is used.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 487

Great numbers are salted and cured, and it is the object of a consider-
able commerce.
THE HETEROTIS.

The best account of the nesting habits of any Osteoglossoidean has
been given by the late J. S. Budgett, who visited Africa in 1900 for
the purpose of studying the life histories of some of that continent’s
remarkable fishes. Like the arapaima, //eterotis is so distinct from
all other forms that it has been set aside as the type of an independent
family. While it agrees with the arapaima and the Osteoglossids as
to the characters already indicated, it has a rounded belly, the dorsal
shorter than the anal, the ventrals submedian, the postorbitals con-
tinuous in an even curve with the suborbitals, the mouth small, and
the branchiostegal rays in reduced number (seven or eight). The
principal characters, however, are skeletal modifications, especially of
the bones of the back of the skull, and, more than all, of the exoccipi-
tal bones, which furnish large accessory condyles for the first vertebra.

Fic. 72.—The Heterotis (Heterotis niloticus), After Valenciennes.

The only known //eterotis, HW. niloticus, is a large fish, occasionally
even attaining a length of 3 feet or more. A good idea of it may be
obtained from the accompanying figure.

The heterotis makes a very large circular nest, and, indeed, in some
of the swamps of west Africa which Budgett visited, one of the most
striking features was “the presence of numbers of enormous nests,”
which looked hke * miniature lagoons,” and which proved to be those
of Heterotis niloticus. The “nests measured four feet in diameter
and were made in about two feet of water.” The walls were * about
eight inches thick at the top and compact, being made of the stems of
the grasses removed by the fish from the center of the nest.” The
floor was “the swamp-bottom, and was made perfectly smooth and
bare.” :

Budgett once had the good fortune to see a “ fantang” (such is
the native name of the heterotis) make a nest, and tells how it was
done. “It was circling round and round the wall of its nest, every
now and then throwing its tail upwards and outwards, tossing on to
the top of the wall the débris from the inside of the nest. Thus it
toiled on until the wall reached the surface of the water and was com-
plete. When the nest was finished the water it contained was per-
488 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

fectly clean and clear, so that I could see with my water telescope the
eggs nearly covering the bottom of the nest. When all the eggs are
laid the fich leaves the nest by a hole at one side.” >

The nest appears to be used “ for at most four or five days.” The
eggs, 1t was thought, were hatched in about two days. The larvee had
long external blood-red gill filaments.

Fie. 73.—Nest of the Heterotis. After Budgett.

As soon as they are released they strike out from the bottom, and,
the day after hatching, “may be seen continually passing up and
down.” The next day “they cease to pass up and down, and converg-
ing to a swarm about one foot in diameter, form a deep continuous
circle remarkable for its regularity and persistence. The swarm occu-
pies the exact center of the little lagoon. The young fry, which by
now have lost the long external gill filaments, are seen to be steadily

careering round and round, ever in the same direction, for at least a
day. About the fourth day the swarm becomes less persistent and
regular, the larvee swimming first to one side of the nest and then to
the other, until about the fifth day they leave the nest by the exit for a
few trial trips, attended by the parent, and finally leave it altogether,
swimming hither and thither in a dense swarm, from which the par-
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 489

ent is never far distant.” Budgett kept many of the fry for several
weeks, but “ could not get them to feed and eventually they all died.”

THE UMBRIDS, OR MUDFISHES.

The pairing and oviposition of Mudfishes or Umbrids has not been
observed in America, though IT had some for months under observa-
tion, but P. Carbonnier appears to have succeeded in mating them and
observing the behavior of a parent fish to the eggs and young. The
fact, however, has been universally overlooked owing to his mis-
naming of specimens. He called them “la Fondule (Fundula cypri-
nodonta, Cuv.),” but no such name appears in any of Cuvier’s works
and the fish in question was evidently not a Pundulus, and there is lit-
tle, if any, doubt that it was the common Mudfish (Umbra pygmea)
occurring around New York. The reasons for this identification are
given in Science for December 21, 1906. The article by Carbonnier is
in the Buletin Mensuel de la Société d’Acclimatation for November,
1874 (pp. 665-674). It seems that the female fish there described
watches over her eggs “ with a tender solicitude ” during the fort-
night of “incubation.” “ Elle écarte et emporte avec soin tous les
sédiments terreux qui pourraient etre une cause d’alteration,” ete.
For full details the original article should be consulted. The identi-
fication here made should be confirmed by observations on living
fishes. The habits of the species are of unexpected interest.

Fic. 75.—An Ophiocephalid, Ophiocephalus africanus. After Steindachner.

THE OPHIOCEPHALIDS, OR SNAKEHEADS.

The old Romans had a way of expressing incredulity by reference
to nature, but they were not always happy in so doing. Horace took
as the acme of improbability the existence of a black swan—rara avis
in terris; yet all the swans of Australia are black. Seneca would
“ 90 a-fishing in the sea,” and contrasted with such a natural course
another: “ There are many things in this place will come into thy
minde, which a man may term after a merry sort, both incredulous
and fabulous, that a man should go and fish with his pickaxe and not
with nets and hookes.”

But with pickax and spade may the Ophiocephaloid fishes be
sought in India. The bed of a pond or even a river that appears to

be barren on the surface may harbor a few inches below quite a
harvest in the shape of fishes which have found their way there for
refuge from the drought. It is this group of Ophiocephalids, too,
which furnishes some interesting examples of paternal care.

The Ophiocephalids are elongated fishes with a flattish, declivous
head, scales of moderate size on the body and larger ones on the head
in oblique rows, a long dorsal and a long but shorter anal (both spine-
less), and ventral fins behind or under the bases of the pectoral with
six soft rays, the outermost being undivided, but articulated distally.
These characters are supplemented by a peculiar modification of the
branchial apparatus adaptive to aerial respiration, as well as by many
cther anatomical characters. The labyrinthiform apparatus is also
useful under certain other disturbing conditions, according to Day.
‘When pollution or poisonous substances find access to rivers or mud
is carried down in such quantities as to choke the gills of most forms,
these Ophiocephalide are almost: unaffected, for breath-
ing atmospheric air direct, the presence or absence of flu-
viatile contamination is not of such material consequence
to their existence. They are able to live until the poison
has passed downstream and the waters are again puri-
fied.” The differences from all other fishes, indeed, are
so great that there is not universal agreement as to the
affinities of the family.

The Ophiocephalids are about 30 in number and found
in almost all the tropical and even subtropical regions of
FG. 76.—Ophio- the Old World, 3 occurring in Africa, but all the others

ee in Southern and eastern Asia and the islands to the
southward. In the Philippine Islands are found at least 5 species.

There is no general English name that can take the place of Ophio-
cephalids. Snakeheads is a book name that interprets the Latin title,
but is rarely used. The word in most popular use is murrul, vari-
ously spelled, which is the common vernacular Indian term for species
of the family.

When a prolonged drought dries up the ponds or bodies of water
in which they have flourished the snakeheads do not necessarily
suecumb to the consequences, but are provided with means to contend
xgainst the adverse conditions. Some burrow into the drying bot-
tom, sometimes to the depth of 3 or 4 feet even, into a moister horizon,
end in such places may survive till later rains release them from their
entombment and restore the waters to their former beds. The fishes
retain moisture enough to keep their gills from dessication and are
able to breathe the little air needed direct or even to suspend respira-
tion. Others wander from the receding pond to seek more favorable
quarters. Such emigrations are mostly engaged in during night time

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 49]

and when the ground and air are moist they can travel considerable
distances. This capacity is frequently exercised “in the beginning
of the rainy season,” when they may be “ often seen travelling among
wet grass; ” it is also made use of in the opposite season of incipient
drought. It is claimed by some that such emigrations are not en-
tirely pointless, and that instinct guides them to water, but such
claims have not been confirmed—at least not fully confirmed.

Peripatetic showmen and jugglers avail themselves of this, for :
fish, remarkable aptitude for terrestrial progression, both in India
and China. They carry the fishes about, and when a fitting audience
can be obtained take the fishes from their receptacle and place them
on the ground, when they proceed to “ walk” or “crawl about,”
greatly to the wonder and amusement of the children. ‘ Owing to
the breadth of their bodies they are able to progress in a serpentine
manner, chiefly by means of their pectoral and caudal fins, first one of
the former being advanced and then its fellow.” The progression is
really of the nature of crawling.

The Ophiocephalids are especially piscivorous, but their voracity

Fic. 77.—0Ophiocephalus barca. After Day.

is by no means limited to fishes; indeed they * appear to consider a
frog, mouse, or rat as luscious a morsel as a fellow fish. A frog, in
fact, proves to be as captivating a bait for some of them at least as it is
to a pike. ‘“ Near Ganjam,” India, a native official told Day * how
he had ventured out one night to see how murrul *—the walking
fishes or ophiocephals—* were captured. The fisherman was pro-
vided with a long flexible bamboo as a rod, and as a bait used a live
frog. Hardly had the frog splashed into the water when a moderately
sized murrul seized and swallowed it. Desirous of observing what
would occur next, the fish was left on the hook as a bait for something
else. Before long a large water snake was seen swimming toward it,
and soon had the fish inclosed in its capacious jaws, and in this
fashion all three were pulled together out of the water.” It would
from this seem that they are active and feed by night as they also do
by day.

Naturally when the species are so numerous, there is considerable
diversity in habitat and habits. “Some of them reside in ponds,
499 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

others prefer rivers, where they take up their residence in deserted
holes which they find in the banks. The pond species delight in
lying at the grassy margins, where the water is not deep enough to
cover them; and here they are able to respire atmospherte air direct.”
So teaches Day (1883). ‘“ Some of the ophiocephali prefer dirty to
clean water, perhaps for purposes of concealment. When they have
stirred up all the sediment and exuded a quantity of mucus they ap-
pear to be dehghted, their colors become more vivid, and they ascend
to their favorite resort, lying amongst the vegetation just beneath the
surface of the water. As soon as clean water is given them they be-
come excited, as if they imagined the time had arrived when they
should change their abode.”

But such places and postures are at times exchanged for others.
They may be “ frequently seen floating on the surface of the water
as if asleep.” Such individuals “ may be approached very closely.”
In some places guns are used and the fish are shot, but “the game
usually sinks when killed and has to be dived for or otherwise ob-
tained.” -

The differences either in size or coloration between the sexes are 1n-
considerable. Monogamy and parental solicitude are aceredited to
them. They mostly, it is said, breed twice a year. The eggs are
quite large and vary in number in accordance with the size of the
female; in one Day estimated there were about 4,700 eggs. Ovipo-
sition is provided for in a rude receptacle which is prepared by the
male. “The O. striatus of Mysore is said to construct a nest with
its tail among the vegetation near the edges of the tanks, whilst it
bites off the ends of the weeds which grow in the water.” Over this
the parent keeps guard, and his care is exercised not only for the
eggs, but for the young until they are developed and strong enough
to care for themselves. ‘“ Then they are driven away to seek their
own subsistence,” and those who are “too obstinate to leave,” it is
believed, are “ eaten by their progenitors.”

The Ophiocephalids are highly esteemed for table use, “ those
which inhabit rivers being better flavored than the others which live
in sluggish or stagnant water.” They form in many places a very
important part of the fish supply of the community. They are in
prime condition, or at least chiefly demanded, in a perfectly fresh
state. To supply such a demand, “in China they are often carried
alive in tubs or pails of water, and slices are cut for sale as wanted,
the fish selling dear whilst it retains life, while what remains after
death is considered as of little value.” The entrails are removed
before taking the fish around but the muscles remain long responsive
to irritation, and “ when the irritability of the flesh 1s so much ex-
hausted that it no longer quivers under the knife, its value is greatly
depreciated.” This practice, Richardson thinks, “ however much it
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 4938

may shock the feelings when described, is not worse than the crimp-
ing of cod on the London fish stalls.” It is almost superfluous to
add, after this account, that “ they are very tenacious of life.”

By the natives the adult fishes, as well as their eggs, are * greatly
sought after as food.”

To insure a continuous supply they are kept to a considerable
extent in ponds or tanks and even in aquaria, but their wandering
proclivity and climbing capability entail precautions against their
emergence. ‘They are exceedingly difficult to retain in aquaria
unless the tops are covered over, as otherwise they manage to escape
and proceed on their travels.”

494 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

There is, in other respects than those mentioned, much more di-
versity than im most other families, although the species are not very
numerous; their exact number, however, is uncertain. The species
appear to be subject to unusual variation, and characters which would
be of specific importance in most groups in this appear to be merely
individual deviations. <A result of this was that before the extent of
this variability was appreciated many specific names were based on
what later proved to be unstable characters. For instance, an able
French naturalist, Prof. Emile Blanchard, thought that in France
alone there were seven species with three dorsal spines and four
species with many. He was even strongly inclined to think that
other species (plusieurs espéces) remained to be discovered.

Naturalists of the present day reduce the seven to one (Gasteros-
feus aculeatus) and the four to another (Pyqgosteus or Pungitius
pungitius). It is not impossible, however (but not probable) that
it may be found that from the extreme of undue multiplication or
“splitting” of species there has been a revulsion to an opposite
extreme of excessive “ lumping.” Much more certain are the genera:
these are readily separated and stand out boldly in nature. Three
of these occur in the Old World—Gasterosteus, Pungitius (Pygos-
teus), and Spinachia. Gasterosteus and Pungitius are equally well
represented in North America, and the absence of Spinachia is more
than balanced by the existence here of two unknown to Europe—-
Eucalia and Apeltes. Of all these the nesting habits are more or
less known.

All the sticklebacks take care of their eggs and the newly born
young, but it is the male, and not the female, that exercises parental
care; he it is that builds a nest that would do credit to a bird and
drives or entices the full female to enter into it and deposit her ripe
burden. When a sufficient supply of eggs has been secured, the male
closes the nest and remains in charge till the young have reached
a size which he considers to be sufficient to enable them to wander
away and seek their own living.

The sticklebacks have been divided among three groups or sub-
families.

The three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus), ten or many spined
sticklebacks (Pygosteus), and those with four or five dorsal spines
rechinable directly backward (#'wcalia) belong to it.

obtuse behind, lateral bars, and between them an unarmed belly.

A third type, the Spinachiines, have the pelvic bones loosely con-
nected in front only and the ventral fins inserted farther back than
in the others; the body is also more elongated, the snout extends
forward in a somewhat tubiform manner, and the dorsal spines are
more numerous.

The most generally distributed and characteristic of the genera
and that to which the largest species except Spinachia belong is Gas-
terosteus, or the three-spined sticklebacks. The body is comparatively
high and has a fusiform contour, there are two large free spines on the
back and a smaller one in front of the fin, and the ventral spines are
considerably behind the roots of the pectorals and under the inter-
space between the first and second dorsal spines. The most com-
mon species—common to Europe and America
aculeatus.

Almost any permanent body of water, however small, may har-
bor some. In the words of Smitt, “ It is often met with in collections
of water so small and so isolated that it appears difficult, if not
impossible, to explain the manner in which it has been conveyed
thither, or the sources from which it derives its support. It 1s
fondest of calm water, and in summer frequents shallow spots close
inshore, especially where the sunshine has full play. Here it leads
a merry life, and one may often see it leap several centimeters out
of the water, while at other times it keeps still at the same spot, as
though there were nothing in the world to disturb it. But in a
moment it is all hfe and spirit and darts off with the speed of an
arrow. In stormy weather it is tossed on the waves and has thus been
cast even into a boat. Toward autumn it retires to deeper spots on the
shores of channels, estuaries, or larger inlets. In late autumn and at
the beginning of winter, however, it roams about in large companies.”
It then prepares for winter quarters; “ when the cold is most severe,
it probably les packed in large shoals at the bottom.”

496 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

Tt is an eminently gregarious fish and its schools are sometimes very
large, but they are not equally large every year. Some years they may
be comparatively few and in others exceptionally abundant. In
many of the northern streams, W. C. Kendall (1902) testifies, they
occur “in such vast numbers as to be used for fertilizer” and “as
food for cows and dogs, and even for men. They were taken in
large numbers in the brush weirs used for catching small herring on
the coast of Maine, and in the same locality often become a nuisance
by clogging the nets of the swelt seimers.”

One instance illustrative of their occasional extraordinary num-
bers has been often quoted, but is as apt now as ever. In 1776 Pen-
nant claimed that “once in seven or eight years amazing shoals
appear in the Welland ” Canal “and come up the river in the form
of a vast column. They are supposed to be the multitudes which
have been washed out of the fens by the floods of several years and
collected in some deep hole till, overcharged with numbers, they are
periodically obliged to attempt a change of place. The quantity is
so great that they are used to manure the land, and trials have been
made to get oil from them. <A notion may be had of this vast shoal
by saying that a man employed by the farmer to take them has got
for a considerable time 4 shillings a day by selling them at a half
penny a bushel.”

This account has been quoted as unparalleled, but several notices in
American publications come nearly, if not fully, up to it. In the
Canadian Annual Report on Fisheries for 1863 (p. 61) it is reported |
that the three-spined stickleback or picassou was “caught in great
quantities in the small rivers, brooks, and barachois of Magdalen
Islands, where it is used as food for cattle and as manure,” and that
“400 barrels were caught” in 1862 “in the barachois of Basque
Harbor” alone. Four hundred barrels were also caught in 1866 and
sold as manure at 25 cents per barrel, but in 1867 the catch was
smaller (150 barrels) and prices advanced to “ 1s. 3d. per barrel.” 4

Sticklebacks are very voracious and almost omnivorous, their
sapacity being only limited by their size. The eggs and fry of
other fishes suffer severely from their attacks, but with apparently
equal relish they take worms, the minute entomostracan crustaceans,
the larve and imagines of insects, and small mollusks. But they do
not refrain from attacking fishes much larger than themselves. “ Mr.
Mable, at the Weston-super-Mare Museum, had some three-spined
sticklebacks in an aquarium, and some roach, Leuciscus rutilus, were
added. With this invasion the prior inhabitants were dissatisfied,
but not frightened, as they forthwith attacked the newcomers, bit-
ing at them anywhere until they became thoroughly cowed. ‘These
little tyrants were observed to place themselves in front of the roach,

a Wisheries Appendices for 1866 (p. 42) and 1867 (p. 34).
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 497

steady themselves by their tails, and then suddenly dart straight at
the lips of their intended prey, from which they bit pieces out.
These attacks were continued until all the roach had been killed,
when they were eaten by their conquerors.”

Another instance of insatiable voracity has been recorded by Baker.
One devoured in five hours 74 young dace, which were a quarter of
an inch long and of the thickness of horsehair. Two days afterwards
it swallowed 62, and would probably have eaten as many every day
could they have been procured for it.

Such are the main facts respecting the general habits of the stickle-
backs, but their chief interest to us are the extraordinary nests which
they make and the still more extraordinary provision with which
nature has endowed the males to make those nests.

When spring and warm weather are well advanced males and
females become impressed with the instinct to reproduce their kind,
and the whole organization is modified accordingly. The female’s
abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and the male, who had been
silvery white during winter, assumes a brilliant livery, develops from
the urinary bladder and kidneys the material for a peculiar thread-
like substance, and prepares to make a nest for the reception of eggs
of such females as he may be able to influence.

The peculiar secretion from the kidneys deserves some notice here,
for it is unique and only known in the sticklebacks. It was first
fully described by Karl Mobius (1885) and soon afterwards by John
Ryder (1882) and E. E. Prince (1885). The last has not only given
an excellent account of the peculiar structure, but some apt illustra-
tions, and these are reproduced herewith. (Plate I.)

SECRETION FROM KIDNEYS IN GASTEROSTEUS.
t

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 499

On examining the male at the breeding season, the kidneys are seen to be
considerably swollen, the enlargement being especially noticeable posteriorly
(fig. 1 A). Sections of the kidneys reveal an altered condition of the sinuous
tubules (fig. 1 A, 6), the conical epithelial cells of which are swollen at their
free ends and indefinite in outline. The nucleus of each cell is slightly dis-
placed and occupies a more terminal position than in the normal condition.
These epithelial cells are active in secreting the material used in constructing
the nest. They perform the function, indeed, of cell glands, and their secretion
is carried by the uriniferous tubes to the o1ter ventral border of each kidney,
where a large duct passes longitudinally. In cross section the ureters (pl.
I, fig. 1 A, a, @) are oval, and their capacity is very great at this time, the
-walls being of dense fibrous tissue lined with pavement epithelium. Both
ureters emerge from the renal mass near the posterior end, and descending in
a forward direction become applied to the wall of the so-called urinary bladder,
which at this point is somewhat attenuated, and passing anteriorly they open
obliquely from without inward into the bladder. This structure, it is unneces-
sary to say, is not morphologically connected with the urinary receptacle of
higher vertebrates, the lengthened course of the ureters, of which it is simply
a dilated common portion, being due to its extraordinary development in the
male stickleback. In a fish 54 inches in length it is about an inch long, and at
its widest part one-fifth inch in diameter. Situated on the right side of the
abdominal cavity, immediately below the swim bladder in the posthepatie
region, it has the form of a capacious pyriform sac, ending blindly anteriorly,
and diminishing in circumference as it passes backward (pl. 1, fig. F, @).
Before terminating posteriorly it describes a double curve, crossing over the
intestine from the right to the left side (pl. 1, fig. 6, b), and after a short
parallel course passing on the ventrai side of the intestine to the right side
again (pl. 1, fig. 6, ¢), debouching behind the genital pore (pl. 1, fig. 6, d)
into a urinogenital sinus, forming the posterior portion of a cloacal depression
(pl. 1, fig. 6, e), into which also the anus opens (pl. 1, fig. 6, 7). The wall
of the bladder consists of two layers, an internal epithelium (pl. 1, fig. 1 B, @),
which is readily detached, and a dense external connective layer (pl. 1, fig.
1 B, 6), which thins out as the blader enlarges anteriorly. Traces of an inter-
Inediate muscular layer appear posteriorly where the walls are extraordinarily
thickened. The descending ureters (pl. 1, fig. 1 B, € ¢) approach opposite
sides of the bladder, that on the left proceeding obliquely below the common
duct of the vasa deferentia, and passing forward and merging in the walls of
the bladder on the left side.

This union is shown in the same transverse section which shows the union of
the vas deferens of the left testis with that of the right. The course of the right
ureter is shorter and more direct, as the bladder lies on that side of the abdom-
inal cavity at this point. It coalesces with the right wall of the bladder pre-
cisely opposite the left ureter. As the bladder descends to cross the intestine
inferiorly it twists, so that the left ureter is brought to the central side of the
cervix of the bladder. Both return to the lateral position as the bladder crosses
the intestine. The intestine now curves to the right, and the relations of the
ureters become reversed, the right being below and the left rising to the dorsal
side of the bladder. They increase rapidly in capacity, showing in cross section
an extremely elliptical cavity, and as the bladder enlarges they pass obliquely
into its chamber, their walls being continuous with the external layer of the
bladder. Along this tortuous course the viscid secretion of the renal tubules
reaches the bladder, where it is stored up. When first formed the secretion is
simply a plastic jelly; but a fibrillar structure appears to rapidly develop in it.
5OO PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

Indeed this appearance is assumed while the secretion is contained in the
ureters. The epithelial cells of the urinary canals exert so actively the secret-
ing function that the bladder becomes much distended by the accumulating
mucus, and at length it flows slowiy to the urinary aperture, where it emerges
as a tenacious elastic thread which readily adheres to any external object on
contact. It can hardly be doubted that this secretion can be extruded at
pleasure, the walls of the bladder, assisted by the abdominal parietes, being
sufficient to effect this; but it is produced so abundantly that it also often
appears to ooze out involuntarily. Male fishes may often be seen with a glisten-
ing, pendulous, conoid mass hanging from the urinary aperture, and increasing
in size until it becomes detached. Such flask-shaped masses of mucus occur
frequently in tanks where these fishes are confined and no opportunity is
afforded for nest building. When, however, an appropriate mass of seaweeds
has been selected by the. male, the fish has merely to approach closely, so that
the protruding mucus may adhere to a projecting frond, and by passing and
repassing round the mass the weaving operation is accomplished. Occasionally
& rapid ejaculatory movement is observed, and it is interesting to note that the
threads are not carelessly superposed, except when necessary for increasing the
density of the nest, but are crossed at an angle by the varying movements. of
the fish, so that rhomboidal spaces are inclosed and a regular reticulum is thus
produced (pl. 1, fig. 5).

Often the tightly dvawn thread snaps asunder, though its tenacity is extreme.
The fibers then curl up and form a terminal pellet, many of which occur on the
surface of the nest. As before remarked, the mucus is not merely a semisolid
plasm, but assumes a funicular character while in the ureters. If one of the
chords binding a nest together be examined, it will be found to consist of several
strands, the cord itself measuring from 0.0046 to 0.0051 inch in diameter, and
the constituent threads from 0.0008 to 0.00092 inch. These smaller threads
again consist of fine homogeneous filaments, which adhere in parallel order.
The parallel arrangement of the ultimate fibrils is very striking and quite char-
acteristic (pl. 1, fig. 4).

The stickleback is by no means a monogamist, as was once believed,
but endeavors to induce a number of females to deposit eggs in the
nest. he has built. His bellicose tendency, always considerable, is
now greatly intensified, for he is exceedingly jealous and takes of-
fense at every appearance of intrusion or even approach to the
domain which he has appropriated for his own. ‘The males, too, are
fewer than the females, and a consequence is that there are many
furious battles. Smitt tells what may happen:

Two rivals rush with the speed of arrows against each other, deal a power-
ful side-stroke with their sharp ventral spines, and hasten with undiminished
speed each back to his own domain. After a few onsets the superiority of the
stronger combatant is demonstrated, his territory is extended, and he signal-
izes his triumph by a splendor of colours, while the yanquished lays aside
his brilliant dress as though overcome by shame. While the males disport
themselves in these chivalrous tournaments, or rather, fight for their nests, the
females swim about in long troops of greater or less strength outside the battle
ground, and now and then a male selects his temporary mate from the company.
The female that heads the troop swims forward with rapid darts, followed by
the others, suddenly stops and assumes a vertical position, with head turned
toward the bottom. The others assemble round her and range themselves in
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 5OL1

the same manner, as densely packed as possible. When she has thus collected
the troop round her, she suddenly deals a blow that seatters the whole crowd
in an instant. This sport is often repeated, but the rapidity with which they
disperse renders it impossible to observe whether it is always the same female
that takes the lead or whether they change places. These operations are con-
tinued as long as the sun is high in the heavens, for four to six days, according
to the weather. It seems more than probable that during these evolutions the
females lose some roe, which adheres to water plants, and that this is fertil-
ized by the males that, perhaps only for the time being, have not built any nest
for the eggs. Benecke has also ascertained that under certain circumstances—
as, for example, when he finds a suitable crevice or secluded nook among the
water plants—the male does not build any nest, properly so called. Thus
we have to deal with two methods of spawning in which the eggs are de-
veloped where they fall, among the
water plants, and the more connubial
method in which the eggs are devel-
oped in a nest made by the male.
But in any case the nest building is
one of the most interesting parts of
the life of the three-spined stickle-
back, and one which many have been
in a position to observe.

One of the fullest and_ best
considered, as well as earliest of
the accounts of the habits of
the stickleback was published in
1854 by Albany Hancock, in
“ Observations on the nidifica-
tion of Gasterosteus aculeatus
and Gasterosteus spinachia,” in

Naturalists’ Field Club for 1851-—
1854 (Vol.II, pp. 312-317). He

or five sticklebacks, [and] they at

once made themselves perfectly at ease. One, without the least hesitation, took
possession of a certain spot, which it guarded with the greatest pertinacity,
attacking vigorously any of its companions that might happen to approach the
chosen locality. The beetle, too, which sometimes came slowly paddling by, was
pounced upon and unceremoniously tumbled over; but secure within his scaly
armor, as the knights of old, he little heeded the onslaught of his naked assail-
ant, SO overpowering all opposition he scrambled onward in his undeviating
path.

This fish was rather small, had the throat of a bright red colour and the eyes
of a brilliant bluish-green. At first, all the others were pale; but in the course
of a few days one of them gradually assumed the rich hues of that just de-
scribed, and soon afterwards it also became attached to a spot, taking up its
abode in one of the corners of the trough. On examining attentively the two
502 PARENTAL CARK AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

selected localities, a nest was found in each, composed of a collection of deli-
cate vegetable fibers, resting on the bottom of the trough and matted into an
irregularly circular mass, somewhat depressed, and upward of an inch in
diameter, the top being covered over with the same materials and having in the
center a large hole. The fishes scarcely ever strayed from their nests, but were
constantly on guard, defending or repairing them. They were perpetually
prying into the hole at the top and thrusting their heads right into it. On
one occasion, one of them entered by this hole, and slowly forced itself through
the side of the nest. As it gradually moved onwards its body had a pecu-
liar, lateral vibratile motion.
They would frequently seize
hold of the nest and give ita
violent tug, shaking and
tearing loose -the vegetable
matter of which it was
composed; at other times
they would carry to it in
their mouths fine conferva-
stems and press them with
considerable force into the
wall of the nest or thrust
them into the hole, which
by this means was par-
tially concealed. Occasion-
ally each was observed hover-
ing over its nest with the
head close to the orifice, the
body being inclined upwards
at an angle of about 45°,
fanning it with the pectoral
fins, aided by a lateral mo-
tion of the tail. This curious
Inancuvre was apparently
for the purpose, so to speak,
of ventilating the spawn,
which could be distinctly
seen through the orifice at
the top; at least, by this
means, a current of water
was made to set in towards
the nest, as was rendered
perfectly evident by the agi-
tation of particles of matter
attached to it. This fanning or ventilating process was repeated at short
intervals during the day and every day until the spawn was hatched, to
accomplish which took between two and three weeks.

Only one nest contained spawn; the other was torn in pieces and the mate-
rials scattered about, in the hope that we might have the pleasure of seeing it
reconstructed. In this we were not disappointed; the fish immediately began
to form a new nest in exactly the same spot, and by the following day it was
more than half completed. It took a mouthful at a time and was at some
pains in adjusting each load, spreading the materials out and pressing them
down with its mouth; it then drew its body slowly over the whole, vibrating

spawning. After Coste.
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 5038

all the time in the same peculiar manner as when it forced its way through the
nest, as before stated.

On the 15th of June, the hole at the top of the fruitful nest was found to
be much enlarged, so that the entire mass of spawn was exposed to view, and
on looking attentively a few of the newly hatched fry were seen flitting around
the wall of the nest. The assiduity of the parent was now greatly increased ;
it never left the spot; by night it rested either on the nest or by its side, and
during the day nothing was allowed to approach. It fiercely seized a quill
that was passed down toward the object of its solicitude with such vigour that
the shock of attack was distinctly felt by the hand. Combats with its
companions became more frequent, but its ire was. chiefly directed toward
its neighbour, which, like itself, was engaged in parental duties. This having
also a nest to defend, never shrank from the conflict, and the encounters were
therefore fierce and prolonged, but nevertheless conducted with all due caution
and apparently with much science, as the gentlemen of the ring would express
it. The sparring was very wary, and generally lasted a few seconds before the
combatants closed. The attack was usually commenced by one quietly creeping
up, watching its opportunity; on this, the other, acting on the defensive,
would turn its broad side to the enemy, and raising the ventral spine wait to
receive the onslaught; the assailant, intimidated by this formidable demon-
stration, would then slowly retreat, and in its turn had in the same manner to
defend itself. After thus advancing and retreating for a few times, one,
taking advantage of an unguarded moment, would rush in upon its opponent
and butt at it with its head, apparently endeavoring to bite; the other, rallying,
returned the compliment, and after dashing at each other in this way two or
three times with extraordinary rapidity the round would terminate and each
fish retreat to its nest, to recommence its more immediate nidimental duties.

The fry were at first so minute and transparent that they could scarcely
be discerned as they lay partially concealed amid the meshes of the nest;
every now and then a slight fluttering motion betrayed their position, other-
wise it was almost impossible to distinguish them. As I closely watched their
motions at this time, one of the newly hatched fishlings, with intrepidity
beyond its experience, ventured to pass the limits of its cradle: in an instant
the watchful parent was there, and with gaping mouth seized the little wan-
derer, which immediately disappeared, the jaws having closed upon it. Seeing
this I at once gave up the fry as lost, deeming that here was an instance of
instinct at fault and that all the affectionate solicitude of the parent was to
end in devouring its offspring. In this I was mistaken: the old fish, quietly
returning, dropped the straggler into its nest lively and uninjured. During
the whole of this day none of the fry were permitted to ramble beyond the
precincts of their fold; when any attempted to do so—and many did attempt—
they were invariably brought back in the mouth of the parent: none escaped
its vigilant eye, and it was amusing to see with what a hurried, fluttering
motion the little things dropped almost perpendicularly down into the nest,
so soon as they were released from the jaws of the parent.

It was three days before all the eggs were hatched, and the attention of the
parent during all this time was unremitting. On the second day I marked its
manceuvres for five minutes and found that in this short period it ventilated the
nest eight times, warded off an attack of the neighbouring fish, and brought back
to the nest a straggler or two. During this day the spawn was frequently
examined by the parent, who would occasionally seize hold of it and give it a
good shake, apparently for the purpose of throwing off adherent matter, that the
water might freely circulate about the eggs. The parent would then dive head
504 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

foremost into the nest and bring out a mouthful of mud, which it would carry
to some distance and discharge with a puff.

The third day was passed in much the same manner, only as the eggs were
now all hatched the nest was less frequently fanned or ventilated, and the fry,
about 40 in number, were allowed greater liberty, the strongest being permitted
to recreate themselves among the confervie that grew on a stone about 2 inches
from the nest. On the fourth day the fanning had ceased altogether, and the
rambles of the young were less restricted. They were not yet, however, permitted
to pass beyond certain limits. When any transgressed these bounds they were
immediately seized as heretofore and carried back to the nest, into which they
were always very glad to escape from the clutches of their ardent parent.
Notwithstanding all her vigilance one contrived, on the fifth day, to escape her
eye, and in passing the fateful boundary was immediately devoured by the
other fish, which now seemed always on the watch, neglecting its own barren
nest, being intent only on appropriating to itself the nestlings of its fruitful
neighbour. In this act of cannibalism we see the reason for the parent’s anxious
eare and its jealousness of its kind; and it is evident from Mr. Crookenden’s
account, previously quoted, that they greedily devour each others spawn. The
young fry, however, have other enemies as well as their own species. One day
a favorite Hydra (H. fusea) was observed to be distended in a most extraordi-
nary manner. On examination it was found to have swallowed the head and
shoulders of one of the young fish many times larger than itself, and the caudal
extremity, which was too much for it and which was projecting out of its mouth,
had been seized upon by another Hydra. Thus it would appear that these low
organized but powerful and voracious animals occasionally regale themselves
on the flesh of the Vertebrata. This happened when the fry were three or four
weeks old.

All the old fish, with the exception of that with the young, were, in conse-
quence of their Cannibal propensities, turned out of the trough; and danger
being thus removed, the fry were no longer restricted in their rambles, but
enjoyed the whole range of their crystal abode. Henceforth the parent’s assi-
duity gradually relaxed, though for days afterwards it was its custom to
take the young occasionally into its mouth, and after carrying them a little
distance to let them drop out again. I took one of the fry out one day for
examination with the microscope. On returning it to the trough it was in so
sickly a state as to be scarcely able to leave the vessel, which was held in the
hand. The old fish, perceiving the helpless condition of its offspring, came up
to the surface of the water, and seizing hold of the exhausted young one car-
ried it off almost from amid my fingers, and taking it to some distance puffed it
out of its mouth into a tuft of confervee. This courageous act of our little fish
would seem, in Some measure, to give credence to the assertion, so frequently
made, that some of the sharks protect their young by receiving them into the
mouth on the approach of danger.

The stickleback’s life is probably a short one. For a long time it
was supposed to be biennial, but one individual at least was kept for
“nearly double that time.”

Such are the habits of the three-spined stickleback. Those of the
other species of the family are similar in most respects, but each group
of species seems to have its own special way of making its nest, as
Coste long ago (1848) showed. According to the French naturalist,
while the three-spined sticklebacks (Epinoches) invariably (invari-
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 505

ablement) construct their nests on the ground and open to view; the
many-spined sticklebacks (Epinochettes) on the contrary always
attach theirs to vegetation, such as the leaves of aquatic plants. Coste
considered this difference to be of importance enough to indicate
generic distinction for the fishes making the nests, and consequently

he restricted the name Gasterosteus to the three-spined sticklebacks,
and proposed Pungitius for the many-spined species.“

@As the nomenclatural proposition has been universally overlooked, and the
work in which it is published is inaccessible to most, Coste’s own words, conclud-
ing the generalization, may be given: “* * * différence caracteristique qui
parit justifier la séparation qu’on a faite de ces poissons en deux genres (Gds-
terosteus et Pungitius).” Pungitius thus anticipates Pygosteus.

Spinachia has also a characteristic habit of making a nest, using as
a basis a frond of seaweed or some sea plant. The nests ‘ occur most
frequently among seaweeds fringing the tidal pools, and of such
marginal reeds they are constructed,” as has been indicated by Prince.

THE SUNFISHES AND THEIR KIN.

Perhaps the fishes best and most generally known to the boys, and
consequently the elder natives of eastern and middle America, are
those most frequently called sunfishes or sunnies, but which also are
misnamed in various localities bream, roach, and perch. Bream and
its corrupt form, brim, are, indeed, in most common use in many
places, especially in the Western States. These are the most gayly
colored of a family designated by ichthyologists as Centrarchids, and
with popular intent sometimes dubbed the Sunfish family. All have
a compressed body, which is mostly expanded vertically and almost
equally below and above the longitudinal axis of the body. The
scales are mostly rather large or of moderate size, but in some (the
black basses) rather small, and the lateral line is continuous. The
head is scaly and in most the suboperculum is expanded backward in
an ear-like flap. The nostrils are double. The roof of the mouth is
dentigerous, the teeth being in some confined to the vomer, but in
most extending on to the palatines and in some also to the pterygoids
and the tongue. There are mostly six branchiostegal rays, very rarely
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 507

seven. The lower pharyngeal bones are always distinct. The dor-
sal and anal fins are diversiform, but in most of the species the soft
portions of the dorsal and anal fins are almost exactly opposite and
balance each other. These characters are supplemented by still more
important osteological ones, which confirm the natural association of
the genera.*

Besides the sunfishes, others of greater economical importance be-
long to the family, as the black basses, the crappies, and the rock
basses. Thirty and more species in all represent the family and all
are confined to North America and mostly to the United States, but
half a dozen extend into northern Mexico and two are peculiar to
her northern States.

So far as known all the Centrarchids take more or less care of
their eggs and young, and doubtless it is always the male parent that
undertakes this charge. There are, however, various degrees to
which care is exercised, and it is possible (not probable) that some
may fail to take any care of either eggs or young. There should cer-
tainly be some young naturalist who will undertake to watch and
study the aberrant members of the family.

The species whose life histories are best known are the black
basses (Micropterus dolomieu and M. salmoides). On these innumer-
able articles and pamphlets have been published, and 3 volumes
or treatises of superior value.” One of these is James A. Henshall’s
“Book of the Black Bass” (1881, 1889; 463 pp.; 2d ed., 1904),
another, Henshall’s ** More about the Black Bass” (1898), and the
latest and most authoritative of all is a monograph by Jacob Reig-
hard, “ The Breeding Habits, Development, and Propagation of the
Black Bass,” published as Bulletin of the Michigan Fish Commission
No. 7. Henshall expresses the opinion of many in his declaration
(More, 47) that “the Black Bass is excelled by no other fish that
swims for gameness and among fresh water species by but one, the
White-fish | Coregonus |, for the table.”

The family is quite diversiform and three major groups or sub-
families are recognizable, the Micropterines, the Lepomines, and the
Centrarchines.

The Micropterines, or black basses, are the least specialized and
most like serranoid or perciform fishes. They are of rather elongate
oblong form, with weak dorsal spines reduced backward and an anal
shorter than the soft dorsal and also with weak spines. The colors

The Lepomines, or sunfishes, have the body comparatively short, the
dorsal spines robust and not decreasing in size backward, and the anal
fin has a soft portion opposite and equal to that of the dorsal and
with its front part formed ef three or more stout spines. Most of the
species of the family belong to this group, and almost all are bril-

sometimes variegated earlike extensions of the operecular membranes.
The colors rival those of such tropical fishes as the angel fishes or

the dorsal; each has nearly the same number of spines, which regu-

The common sunfish (/wpomotis gibbosus) may be taken as the
best known of the typical species of the family, although of course
the black basses are the most famous and have been most written
about. The habits of the sunfishes and black basses are not very
different from each other.

THE SUNFISHES AND ESPECIALLY THE COMMON SUNFISH (Hupomotis gibbosus).

If we are able to approach near enough, under ordinary conditions
we may watch the sunfishes in all their movements. One will be
found suspended in the water some distance above the bottom, with
the dorsal and anal spines depressed backward and the soft portions
erect and perhaps every once in a while gently undulated; the pec-
torals are extended outward, but also shghtly undulated, while the
ventrals are mostly closed and kept tightly appressed to the belly;
the mouth is shghtly open, and the branchiostegal membrane barely
moves. Another may be seen with all its fins as erect as those repre-
sented in the illustration. Some may rest horizontally in the water,
others tilted forward and downward, and still others with the snout
directed upward.* A flirt of the caudal fin and bend of the tail impel

510 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

the fish in a different direction. They are sociable fishes and apt
to be found in small schools. There is a deliberate slowness in their
movements, when undisturbed, which gives one the idea of dignity
of manner. A splash in the water, nevertheless, at once disperses
them, and away they scurry with rapid fin, to reassemble after a short
time. The sociability is most pronounced in the first year of the
fish’s life, but afterwards, as the fishes advance in age, they are more
disposed to keep to themselves. The time of activity is mostly during
daylight, and at night they rest.1_ They are entirely voiceless.”

The common sunfish, on the whole, prefers clear and temperate
water and the neighborhood of aquatic plants; ponds and lakes are
the favorite bodies, and a couple of the names that the species bears—
pond fish and pond perch—are popular tokens of recognition of that

Fie. 91.—Common Sunfish (Hupomotis gibbosus).

preference; some are, however, found almost anywhere, carried by
currents or wandering of their own will, and thus may be sometimes
found with the long-eared sunfish, which is more of a running-water
species.

The food of the sunfish has been examined by 8. A. Forbes, and the
results published in the Bulletins of the Hlinois State Laboratory of
Natural History (1878-1883). It is not ichthyophagous—that is, a
fish eater—as seems to be generally supposed, but depends mostly on
small shellfish and insects. A considerable percentage of vegetation
is also taken in, perhaps incidentally with the shellfish and insects
found in connection with it. ‘“ Not a trace of fishes was found in the

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 511

stomachs of 25 individuals critically examined. Over half of the
food was ascertained to be of small mollusks (46 per cent of uni-
valves and 6 per cent of bivalves) ; insects contributed 20 per cent,
and crustaceans 22 per cent; the remaining percentage (12 per cent)
was furnished by plants—characee, myriophyllum, and alge.” Of
course the percentage would vary greatly with conditions. Although
no worms appear to have been found, anglers need not be told that
an earthworm is an excellent bait. Doubtless little fishes, too, may
be occasionally taken in if they come in the way. Another source of
food not referred to by Forbes is yielded by true fishes. The sun-
fishes are, to a considerable extent, spawn eaters, but at least they are
not notorious for attacks on the spawn of useful fishes, and, so far,
they are best known for the service they perform as spawn eaters
and not for injuries committed, for it was through forays on the
eggs of the useless and harmful bowfin or dogfish of the lakes
(Amia) that its spawn-eating proclivities became most evident.
Reighard, in his long-continued observations of the nests of the bow-
fin, found that whenever one was deserted by its maker it was liable
to be raided by sunfishes.

When the returning heat of spring has put new life in the fishes,
as well as the rest of nature, the sunfish feels its influence, and it is
made manifest in an added brilliancy of coloration to the males and
the turgid abdomens of the females. They are ready to proceed to
their procreative duties about May. The fullest observations of the
nuptial condition have been made by Jacob Reighard.* ‘In the male
of Hupomotis gibbosus the colors are much brighter than in the
female. The vermicular markings on the cheeks of the male are more
brilliant than those of the female; the opercular ear flap is larger and
bordered with scarlet and blue; the ventrals of the male are black,
while those of the female are yellow; the dorsal and caudal of the
male are much more brilliantly blue than those of the female. In
approaching the female, in order to induce her to enter his nest to
spawn, the male elevates or puffs out the gill covers so as to display
their brilliant markings. At the same time the opercular ear flaps are
erected and the black ventral fins spread out. When in this attitude
the male faces the female, and it is when seen from the front that his
display of color is most brilliant. He assumes a similar attitude when
threatening other males. He was never seen to assume this attitude
except under the circumstances described, so that the display of color
resulting from the attitude must be regarded as a means of expressing
the emotions.”

But, like the cock, which it emulates in action as well as decoration,
the sunfish is apt to excite and incur the hostility of rival males.

aJ. Reighard, Science, April 11, 1902, p. 575.
512 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

According to Abbott, the “courtship of this gaudy fish has been no

easy matter. Hundreds of his kind, as bright as he, have, like him,
striven by the hour to clear the field of every rival, and the clear.
waters are often turbid with sand and grass torn from the bed of the
stream as the older males chase each other from poit to point,
endeavoring by a successful snap to mutilate each other’s fins. No
courtship battles among birds are more earnestly fought, and as the
bird with bedraggled feathers is wise enough to withdraw from the
contest and quietly seek a mate when his soiled plumage is in part
restored, so. the sunfish with torn fins retires from the contested nest-
ing ground. But not a sound has been made by these excited fishes

except that of the rippling of the water when cut by their spiny fins
as they chanced to reach above the surface.”

Meanwhile the male has selected a spot in very shallow water near
the shore, and generally in the midst of aquatic vegetation not too
large or close together to entirely exclude the light and heat of the
sun, and mostly under an overhanging plant. His choice is apt to
be in the same general stretch of shallow water as is favored by many
others, so that a number of similar nests may be found close together,
although never encroaching on each other, close by the shore. Each
fish shghtly excavates and makes a saucer-like basin in the chosen
area, which is carefully cleared of all pebbles. Such are removed
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. bls

by violent jerks of the caudal fin, or are taken up by the mouth and
carried to the circular boundary of the nest. An area of fine, clean
sand or gravel is generally the result, but not infrequently, according
to Dr. Reighard (én litt.) , “ the nest bottom is composed of the root-
lets of water plants.” The nest has a diameter of about twice the
length of the fish.
Very often, if not generally, the row of nests is in water that
rapidly becomes deeper offshore, so that if the sunfish is alarmed it
-may quickly scurry off into deep water, where it remains till the
alarm is over. According to Abbott, “the return to the nest is as
rapid and direct as the exit. Each fish, wherever it may go, has
some point which is recognized as the terminus of the lane leading to
the nest, and having found this it speeds up the narrow pathway
with incredible velocity, and stops as suddenly just at or in,the nest.”
To the nest thus formed a female is enticed, who is prepared to
make a deposit of her eggs After a longer or shorter courtship, as
the case demands, the two come together bringing their bellies close
to each other, the male a httle behind his mate, and eggs and milt
follow each other in rapid succession. The conjunction lasts for
about a minute, more or less, and, as a rule, is not repeated very
soon after. The viscid eggs as soon as laid fall to the bottom and
become attached to the gravel that forms the bottom of the nest.
According to Dr. Reighard (in litt.) “a female if undisturbed takes
about an hour to lay her eggs, though she may frequently during this
time leave the nest and return to it again.” When the female has
completed oviposition, she departs and the male assumes sole charge.
The sunfish, however, is not strictly a monogamist,” and is not always
satisfied with the eggs of one female.
Reighard (1908) yas noticed “a case in which an individual male

aThe ens noted by Abbott ang Te nai eter only under certain condi-

+ Doctor Abbott was doubtless mistaken in supposing (1884) that “ they are
not merely paired for the season, but remain a faithful and loving couple all
the year and for several years,” and that “in these nests both fishes will often
be.” In nests familiar to me many years ago I do not recall one with more
than a single fish in peaceful possession, and that a male. Until 1889, however,
the nest and parental care was entirely credited to the female, or to both. In
accounts by Godman (1833), Kirtland (1856), Agassiz (1857), Abbott (1884),
and Stone (1889) this idea is assumed as a matter of course. In 1889, however,
I urged in Nature (40, 1889, 319) and Forest and Stream (Aug. 8, 1889) that I
believed “ that the chief or the sole guardian of the eggs after their deposition
is the male,” as is the case of the Gasterosteids and Silurids (catfishes). That
such is the case has been later abundantly proved. Reighard recently (1903)
has also stated that ‘ his own unpublished observations on Hupomotis gibbosus
have convinced’ him “that, as surmised by Gill (1889), the female takes no
part in building the nest or guarding it.”

,
514 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

of Hupomotis gibbosus reared in one nest two broods laid at quite dif-
ferent times by two females.” The relation between the sexes of the
sunfish, indeed, is analogous to that of Amia which, Reighard thinks,
“may be described as a promiscuous polygamy.” ‘The female enters
cr is led by her own impulse to the nest after more or less preliminary
play or courtship, deposits her eggs, and then departs or is driven
away. The male having fertilized the eggs redoubles his care. For
many minutes—it may even be for hours at a time—he may remain
poised near the middle of the nest, close above the eggs, watchful for
them and against intruders. If a rival approaches too near, he sal-
lies forth against him and drives him away. One may occasionally
fall a victim to his zeal if a larger fish, snake, or turtle assail him;
prudence nevertheless prevails and impossibilities are not attempted ;
at a man’s approach he flees into deep water, and as long as the man
inanifests activity remains away, although reconnoitering; if the
Inman remains inactive and perfectiy still, the fish may return and
settle over the nest again. Among the most dangerous enemies, how-
ever, are not the large but the small. The darters especially may
deserve their name by darting upon the eggs and bearing off those
dainties for a meal. By Dr. Reighard (in Vitt.) the blackheaded
dace (Pimephales notatus) was found to be the most destructive to
sunfish eggs in Walnut Lake last summer (1905).

John Godman, who was the earliest to publish observations on the
nests of sunfishes, and did so as early as 1829 or 1830, frequently in an
unsportsmanlike manner caught fishes from their nests by means of
a net. He could “ always select the finest and largest of these fish,”
and “such was their abundance that the next day would find all the
nests reoccupied.” Whether the newcomers actually assumed the
role of nest guardians or nest assailants, was not demonstrated.

For about a week, more or less—it depends on the temperature—
ihe male’s attention is absorbed in the care of the eggs, which are
at last hatched. When the larval fry have appeared the parent con-
siders his work at an end and leaves the young to take care of them-
selves as they best may. According to Reighard, care of the eggs is
only “continued until they are hatched,” while in the case of the
black basses it “ may follow the young fish until they are well grown.”

The prominence of the nests of sunfishes in the landscape of a place
is amusingly exemplified by their utilization for forecasting the
weather by country wiseacres, according to Doctor Abbott, of Tren-
ton, N. J., who writes as follows:

The old men of the neighborhood frequently speak of them in this connection
and undertake to forecast whether the coming summer will be wet or dry, from
the fact that their nests are sometimes in water a foot in depth, while at others

less than one-half this depth covers them. These wise old men of the village
sagely shake their heads when the facts are stated, and remark, if the nests
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 515

are Comparatively deep, * It will be a dry summer,” and vice versa. This is based
on the supposition that in dry summers the evaporation will exceed the rain-
fall, and that the fish place their nests in deep water to prevent them from
being left high and dry.

Doctor Abbott justly adds that “ the absurdity of this is apparent.
The nests are occupied but for a portion of one month, and what the
summer may be can in no wise affect them; but of this the village
sages never think. The truth is the same spots are used year after
year, whether the water be high or low.”

The sunfish is to a considerable extent used as a pan fish and is at
least as good as a perch, but on account of its small size (it averages
less than 6 inches) it can not be ranked as an important market fish.
It has been, nevertheless, the object of considerable demand in different
parts of the United States, and the United States Fish Commission
raised and distributed a large number, especially in the early nineties.
The demand, however, was doubtless to a large extent-from dealers
in fancy fishes and for artificial ponds and household ornamentation.

THE CICHLIDS.

The next family that may be considered is that of the Cichlids.
Its chief representatives are much like most of the Centrachids, but
there is considerable diversity in some respects. The form varies
from a high and much compressed body to an elongated one like that
of a pike; the scales are generally of moderate size, in some cycloid,
in others ctenoid; the lateral line in most is interrupted and double
for a short distance on the tail, but ina few merely deflected; the head
is scaly; the nostrils are always single; the palate is never dentiger-
ous; there are mostly five branchiostegal rays, and never more than
six; the lower pharyngeal bones are united, at maturity at least, into
a single bone. Further, systematists lay much stress on the fact that
they have two rows of filaments to the last branchial arch as well as
others usual in fishes, but not in the Pomacentrids, to which they
are most nearly related, and that there is no subocular shelf.

The family is almost entirely confined to fresh waters and further
to those of tropical Africa and America. A very few have extended
beyond these bounds; from Africa several into neighboring Asia
including Palestine; from tropical America one species into sub-
tropical Texas.

Until near the close of the nineteenth century it was supposed
that America was far richer both in genera and species than Africa,
but long after the discovery of Lake Tanganyika explorers of the
animal riches of that great lake were rewarded with an unexpectedly
rich harvest of new types of fishes as well as mollusks. No less than
73 species, representing 24 genera of Cichlids, had been discovered
therein up to the middle of the year 1906.
516 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

The latest monographer of the family, J. Pellegrin, in 1904 recog-
nized 294 species of the family, and of these 161 were inhabitants
of Africa (including Syria) and 133 of America. The 294 were
ranged by him under 55 genera. The chief authority for African
fishes (Boulenger) in 1905 admitted 179 species for that continent,
and more recently Regan has enumerated 133 American species.
Including subsequently introduced or fortified species, there are now
known nearly, if not quite, 350 species.

It is especially noteworthy that each genus is strictly limited to one
continent or at least continental area, not a single African having
American representatives, nor any American an African one. There is
not, however, a natural aggregate of American types to be contrasted
with another of African. Nevertheless most of the American types are
closely related to each other, and there is not the diversity that is
manifested by the African. In one respect, nevertheless, the varia-
tion is much greater. All the African species have three anal spines,
and three only, while in the American they range from three to as
many as fourteen.

Most of the American species at least are very much like the famil-
iar sunfishes of the North American streams and lakes, and when the
writer first saw a small school of coscorobs (Cichlasoma) in a river
of Trinidad he thought it was one of the familiar sunfishes. Not
until he had carefully examined some that were caught was he un-
deceived. A couple of writers of an illustrated book on the Fishes of
Guiana (1841) were not only impressed with the hkeness, but per-
petuated their impressions in the nomenclature, actually referring
species of the family to the genera “ Pomotis” and “ Centrarchus ,”
and so also had two very great ichthyologists (Cuvier and Valen-
ciennes) been misled by a colored figure of a Cuban fresh-water fish,
which they referred to the genus Centrarchus, but which proved to
be a member of the characteristic middle American Cichloid genus
Heros or Cichlasoma. Nevertheless the likeness of Cichlids to Cen-
trarchids is entirely superficial, for they differ in the single nostrils,
toothless palate, the lateral line, the number and arrangement of
branchiostegal rays, the single lower pharyngeal bone, and various
other anatomical characters. Still they may have originated from
not very remote common progenitors, which were, however, neither
specialized Centrarchids nor Cichlids.

The Cichlids exhibit remarkable diversity of oviposition and care
of the eggs and embryonic young. Some “lay their eggs in the
sand,” or, like the northern sunfishes, “ build a kind of nest in the
sand or mud in which they deposit their eggs, hovering over them
until the young are hatched.” Among such are the Hygrogonus
(Astronotus) and Chetobranchus, according to Agassiz. One
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. bln,

(Geophagus lapidifera) was observed by Castelnau in the Araguay
River to carry many pebbles, one by one in its mouth, to a spot where
it deposited them to form a nest. These pebbles were the size of the
end of a finger. In this nest the eggs, resembling mustard seed, were
laid.

Like the Centrarchids, the Cichlids, probably generally, exercise
a parental care, but according to some great authorities (Boulenger
and Pellegrin) in most. cases the females assume guardianship.
Pellegrin found that all the individuals (four) of a common 7i/apia
of Palestine (7. simonis) examined by him which had eggs in the
mouth were females. Boulenger confirmed the ovigerous agency of
the females for many other species. At present, in fact, it appears
that in most (probably all) of the African Cichlids, at least, the
females are the egg carriers rather than the males.

The earliest information respecting the oral gestation of the Bra-
zilian species was given by Agassiz (220) from observations on “a
species of Geophagus” (the sex not stated). “ The eggs pass,” he
knew not how, “ into the mouth, the bottom of which is lined by them,
between the inner appendages of the branchial arches, and espe-
cially into a pouch formed by the upper pharyngeals, which they
completely fill. There they are hatched, and the little ones, freed
from the egg case, are developed until they are in a condition to
provide for their own existence.” He did “ not know how long this
continues,” but had * met with specimens whose young had no longer
any vitelline sac, but were still harbored by the progenitor.” Occa-
sionally, instead of eggs, Agassiz “ found the cavity of the gills, as
also the space inclosed by the branchiostegal membrane, filled with
a brood of young already hatched. The eggs before hatching are
always found in the same part of the mouth, namely, in the upper
part of the branchial arches, protected or held together by a special
lobe or valve formed of the upper pharyngeals.” The cavity thus
occupied by the eggs was thought by Agassiz to correspond “ exactly
to the labyrinth ” of the fishes with labyrinthiform pharyngeals.

AN OLD EGYPTIAN AND PALESTINIAN OVIGEROUS CICHLID.

The principal and longest known of the Cichloid genera is 7'¢/apia,
for a long time generally called Chromis. One species, indeed, was
familiar to a numerous and highly civilized population thousands
of years before there was an English language. It was the object
of the angler’s as well as professional fisherman’s pursuit along
the banks of the Nile under the Pharaohs, and was sculptured on
various monuments. The same species and closely related ones are
inhabitants of Palestine and undoubtedly were the chief products
518 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

of the fisher disciples of Jesus Christ, but they are not specifically
mentioned in the Bible.

Abundant as these fishes are in the lake so celebrated in biblical
story, no specific mention of any of them, or of anv other fishes, oc-
curs in the Bible. All that came into the nets of the old fishermen
of biblical times were simply “ fish.” But even in that prescientific
age, it was recognized that one of the same kind that abounded in the
lake was also found in the Nile. Josephus, in his eulogy of the
beauties of the Plain of Gennesareth, tells that it is ‘“ watered from a
most fertile fountain. * * * Some have thought it a vein of the
Nile, because it produces the coracin fish as well as that lake which
is near Alexandria.” The coracin or crowlike fish, so called on ac-

a Cichlid of the genus 7’lapia, closely related, at least, to the bolti of
Egypt.¢
What is known of the preliminary advances of the male to the
female or courtship has been derived from observations of the 7’/apia
simonis of the “ Sea of Galilee” or Lake Tiberias made by L. Lortet.?

active fishes and to discriminate between them will appreciate how confused he
may become. Placing too implicit faith in the universality of the rule that the

are of a deep blue color. These are deposited by the female in a
slight excavation which she makes among reeds and_bulrushes.
About 200 is the ordinary complement of a good-sized fish. After
she has laid her eggs the female appears exhausted, and remains
almost motionless at a short distance from the deposit. The male,
on the contrary, appears to be much agitated, hovers around the eggs,
swims without cessation above them, and probably fecundates them
at this time. Some minutes later he takes the eggs, one after an-
other, into his mouth and keeps them inside his cheeks, which be-
come notably swollen and distorted outside. Some of the eggs, how-
ever, pass backward between the branchial arches and find a resting
place there. These eggs, though not restrained by any membrane
nor by any glairy or sticky matter whatever, remain in place within
the mouth. The parent never loses them when in the water, and it is
only when he is caught and thrown on the sand that the eggs fall out
in consequence of his spasmodic efforts to breathe. Some, however,
still remain in the mouth.

A SOUTH AFRICAN MALE OVIGEROUS CICHLID.

The most complete observations of the actions of the male guardian
of the eggs and the care of the eggs as well as young were made by
another naturalist, N. Abraham, in 1901. The*species whose actions
Abraham describes was one abundant in Natal, where he lived, and
has been named 7ilapia philander.

In the month of November of 1900 I visited a pond in the neighbourhood of
Durban and received several chromides (Tilapia). I introduced them into a
tank prepared for them and kept careful watch. I at once noticed that one of

resorted to.

The article by Mr. Abraham was sent to Doctor Giinther and by him contrib-
uted to the Annals and Magazine of Natural History (VIII, 821-525). Doctor
Giinther, in his introductory remarks, stated that “one of the specimens sent
[to him] is the individual which Mr. Abraham had under observation for some
weeks, and is a male.” Doctor Boulenger, howeyer, after examination of the
same individual, and of “a further series of Tilapia philander, together with
some 7’. natalensis, which he had received from the Rev. N. Abraham, several
of which have eggs in the mouth, as well as in the genital glands, found all
the egg carriers to be females. Doctor Giinther must, therefore, have assumed
the egg carrier determined by him to have been a male from general principles,
and not after dissection. (See Boulenger, T. Z. S., Xvil, pp. 588, 539, Oct.,
1906.) In accordance with Boulenger’s determination, wherever the words
“he” and “his” occur in the annals “she” and “her” are substituted in the
present article. Boulenger aptly remarks that it “remains unproved whether
in any of the African or Syrian cichlids the ‘ buccal incubation,’ as it has been
called by Doctor Pellegrin, devolves on the male; the instances previously
adduced being either controverted or unsupported by the only reliable evidence,
an examination of the genital glands.”
520 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

these fish showed indications of carrying ova in its mouth. ‘The gill covers did
not fit closely over the cavity containing the gills, but were distended, making
the fish look as though it had a swollen head. This fish I removed into
another “tank,” of which it became the sole occupant. This little fish meas-
ured two inches and three-quarters in length including the tail. The tank in
which I kept it for observation was a small aquarium measuring eight inches by
five, with a depth of water of two and a half inches. <A few roots of Vallisneria
spiralis provided the necessary oxidation of the water. A few days after the fish
was introduced into this “tank ” the swelling out of the gill-covers became more
marked, until they stood out or remained opened quite a distance from the cavity
of the gills. Beyond this feature nothing particular was to be noticed for some
days. But after these days a very interesting stage in the development took
place. I was enabled to see that the ova had evidently matured, for I could see
a number of tiny living forms moving about in the mouth of the parent fish. A
slight development also took place beneath the lower jaw of the fish in the shape
of an expansion of the membrane, which made more room in the mouth and re-
minded one somewhat of the dilatable pouch affixed to the lower mandible of a
pelican. This pouch being partly transparent, as well as a portion of the head
rear to it, I was enabled to see fairly well right into the mouth cavity.

For some minutes nothing could be observed in watching the head of the
fish but the rhythmic movement of the lower jaw and gills; but after an in-
terval I could clearly see all the young fish in a great state of commotion,
filling the whole front of the mouth with a living pack of minute dark creatures
whose movements reminded one of the ways of tadpoles when huddled together
in dense masses, only with this difference, these tiny fish moved with great
rapidity. After these creatures had made one of their periodic excursions to
the front of their parent’s mouth they always retreated out of sight to the back,
and nothing more would be seen of them for a few minutes, and then there
would be another turmoil and mad rush to the front; but none of them ever
escaped out of the mouth. I think that these movements might be accounted
for on the supposition that as these embryonic fish began to grow they gave
the parent fish some inconvenience, and that owing to this the fish was obliged
to constantly force his growing family from the pharynx to the front of the
mouth, giving [her] an opportunity of relieving [herself] from the choking
feeling [She] must have been constantly subjected to. These little fish did not
swim to the front of the mouth, but were evidently rushed there, as they looked
like a ball composed of a great number of minute wriggling creatures whose
real shape could not be seen because of the rapidity of their motion, which
was more a revolving motion than any other. I could not see well enough to
observe whether they were really fish-like in form or embryonic, and I did
not like to disturb the fish enough to find out. I simply kept close wateh
day after day. These movements continued for some days, during which time
I allowed several of my friends to come to my study and witness the strange
sight, which was regularly repeated every few minutes.

After two weeks had passed these movements almost ceased for a time,
and I had fears that all was not going well; but after careful watch for a few
more days I entered my study early one morning, and to my great delight saw
a large number of little fish, very perfect and beautiful, slowly and gracefuily
swimming about near to their parent’s head, their movements now being very
different from the wriggling, hurry skurry which marked their movements prior
to their leaving for the first time their parent’s mouth. I tried to count the
aumber of young in this shoal so strangely brought into the world. 1 counted
sixty for certain, but there were probably two or three more. And now, being
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. yA

anxious to prove the assertion that the parent fish among the chromides take
their young into their mouths, I called into my study some of my family and
asked them to watch what happened when I revolved the table top upon which
the aquarium was standing. Half a return of the revolving top was sufficient—
the whole shoal quickly gathered about the parent’s head; [she] opened [her]
mouth, and into it swam the sixty little fish, leaving us to wonder what had
become of them. It was a wonderful sight and made a vivid impression upon
my mind. It is difficult to describe such a sight; one must see it to appreciate
it. Swiftly, but in perfect order and with great grace, all the young swam into
the open mouth of the parent and disappeared. I ascertained that they meas-
ured a little more than one-third of an inch in length. The parent fish, as I
have said, only measured two and three-quarters inches, yet [she] found room
to pack away in [her] throat over 60 young, each measuring a third of an
inch in length. Once safely within [her] mouth, [she]- did not let them out
again for several hours, and then I was fortunate enough to see [her] expel
them. Two or three were first thrown out of the mouth (shot out, as a smoker
puffs out smoke from his mouth). Then a few more were thrust out, until
nearly thirty were swimming about; then with a circular motion [she] scat-
tered all the rest almost simultaneously into the larger world of water contained
in the tank.

Now that the young fish were out the parent fish watched over them. I had
introduced two fresh-water shrimps into the tank a few days before. The fish
had taken no notice of them, but now the jealous parent chased these poor
shrimps up and down the tank in such a savage way that I had to take them
out. I may add that whenever I wanted to see the young fish swim into their
parent’s mouth it Was only necessary to make some slight disturbance on the
table, and at once the beautiful and strange scene was enacted. After two or
three days the little fish began to venture to the extreme limits of the aquarium
hunting for food, and now, when danger was near, the parent fish did not wait
for the fry to come to [her]—in fact, they did not seem quite so eager to be
swallowed as at first—but [she] went after them, gathering them up one by one
from all parts of the tank until every one was safe within [her] mouth. Each
evening also, at about sundown, all the young fish were gathered up and kept in
the mouth all night. I did not watch all night, but when I looked during the
night I could never see any of the fish about, so I concluded [she] never let
them out after collecting them at sundown until the next morning.

The young fish began to grow not only in size, but in independence, and after
five days from their first exit the parent fish treated them as though the time
had come for them to look after themselves, and soon after [she] took no fur-
ther trouble with them, except in the way of fighting any supposed enemy that
was introduced into the tank.

I may add that I have since observed other fish, with the same result—I
mean, of course, other chromides (Tilapia).

A SOUTH AMERICAN NEST-MAKING CICHLID.

In 1901 a number of living individuals of two Brazilian species
of Cichlids, identified as Geophagus brasiliensis and G. gym-
nogenys, were received in Germany, and two aquariists recorded

the same year (1900)—the fishes had. propagated. At an exhibi-
tion which took place in January of 1901, in Dresden, where, among

PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 523

others, a few of these fishes were exhibited by Mr. Schiime, they justly
created quite a sensation. In the spring of 1901 the young were
already on the market, and I, as one of the first, obtained four indi-
viduals. They were fishes measuring about 5 to 6 centimeters in
length, which I placed in an aquarium of a capacity of about 45
liters of water. The fishes felt apparently quite comfortable in the
well-planted basin, ate with relish all that I offered them—earth
worms, raw meat, and daphnia—were seldom seen, and thrived per-
ceptibly. But after awhile they became more lively in the aquarium,
and fights and persecutions took place constantly. It was then seen
on closer examination that the four fishes presented a very slight
gradation with regard to size. And now the largest was contin-
ually pursuing the three others, the second largest did not leave
the two smaller in peace, and number three made the smallest the
target of his persecutions. The end of the matter was that I with-
drew the two smaller, which had already their fins very much torn,
and placed each one by itself, while I left the two larger in the
aquarium. Meanwhile July had come, and the larger of the two
fishes seemed to take a special pleasure in digging up the whole
aquarium, without, however, stopping the persecution of the smaller
fish. Everywhere he had dug deep holes into the sand, thereby,
of course, uprooting many plants. When about the middle of July,
T examined the smaller fish more closely, it appeared to me as though
its body had swollen perceptibly. I did not, however, pay any fur-
ther attention to this increase in size, for it did not occur to me that
the fishes, only about nine to ten months old, were already about to
propagate, but, on the contrary, I took this increase to be a sign of
their good condition. But from that time on the behavior of the
larger fish toward the smaller changed. The persecution stopped,
and the larger fish devoted itself exclusively to examining the
bottom of the aquarium, which seemed to consist of little hills and
valleys. As the sand covering the dirt layer was only about 3 to 4
centimeters deep, it happened in some places that the fish also stirred
up the dirt with it, which could not but influence the clearness of
the water. At last it appeared to have found a place suitable for its
purpose; I came to this conclusion because it busied itself for a
greater length of time about this place; it had generally taken only
a short time in making the other holes.

After some time I saw how the fish dug up some vallisnerias in this
place, then pulled at them, and finally put the plants away with
evident exertion. After that it deepened the resulting hole very
carefully, fanned away all dirt with its caudal and pectoral fins, and

went in search of the other previously so badly persecuted female.
In the meantime the size of the little fish had further increased a
Hee PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

little, and now there was no doubt left in my mind that I had before
me a highly pregnant female and a male preparing a “ cradle ”—
consequently a pair. It may be imagined with-what expectancy I
looked forward to what was going to happen. In the last days of
July the ovipositor of the female developed, and on the morning of
August 1 I found eggs deposited on the side of the aquarium next
to the window, which I estimated to number from two to three hun-
dred. Because of the troubling of the water through the digging of
the male I could only indistinctly discern the parents, which con-
stantly swam up and down in front of the eggs. After five or six
days I discovered that the eggs had disappeared from the glass, and
on turning aside the plants covering the place where the male had
dug the hole I could discern the constantly moving young. One of
the parents was continually hovering over the hole and appeared
to keep watch while the other was feeding. After eight more days I
noticed one morning that the hole was empty, and on looking about
IT saw the whole swarm of young ones accompanied by the parents -
in a corner of the aquarium searching the bottom and the plants.
And from that time on the young were daily swimming about accom-
panied by the parents, and generally so that the female was in the
midst of the young, while the male would always swim around the
swarm, on the lookout that none of the little ones should get lost.
Sometimes it happened that one of the young stayed behind a little,
then the closely watching parent took the little one into its mouth
and spit it out again in the midst of the swarm, whereupon the young
one turned a few somersaults and then swam merrily away. To be
sure, I also saw at different times that the male did not handle the
young very gently; indeed, at times it would seize them so roughly
and spit them out again with such violence, that they could not stop
their somersaults and slowly sank to the bottom, where they lay twist-
ing and quite slowly recovered. In three or four cases the young
perished through the rough treatment of the father. Every evening
the young were taken to the hole where they remained during the
night.

This pretty exhibition of family hfe lasted about four weeks and
the young had already grown somewhat. Then came, in September,
some very cool days and yet cooler nights, and the number of the
young decreased every day, while the behavior of the parent fishes
to one another became as before, so that I was finally obliged to pro-
tect the female from the bites and hits of the male by removing it
from the basin. The weather became yet colder and with it the
number of the young steadily decreased. I had not at my disposal
an aquarium capable of beimg heated and so had to see how the young,
one after another, disappeared. The male seemed hardly to care
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. hea

about them any longer, and at last I counted only seven of them.
Those I took out of the basin and placed in a little breeding tank.
They held their own in it for a few days more, but finally one morn-
ing the last one was dead.

Later I had prepared a small aquarium capable of being heated
and in which I intended to have the parent fishes winter, but only a
few days later I was obliged to isolate the female, as the male had
been too hard on her. ‘This time the female did not recover from
the bites and wounds received, and after two days I found it floating
dead on the surface of the water. The male, however, was very well
during the entire winter. I had provided the aquarium which it
occupied with only a sand bottom, into which I had put a few plants

Fic, 96.—Geophagus brachyurus,

(Hlodea densa). Yn this sand the fish dug one hole after another
during the whole winter, whereby the plants were of course continu-
ally pulled out. In the beginning I always put the plants back into
the ground when I saw that they had been dug up. But I became at
fast tired of continually replacing the plants and left them as the
fish wanted to have them. Gradually it got them all dug up, except-
ing one behind which it had its place of hiding and of rest. When
it saw anything moving in or near the aquarium, it took refuge
behind this plant. In February I was obliged to give away this fine
fellow for want of room. It stayed with its new possessor a few days
in a tank without any bottom soil whatsoever, and whether it there
missed the digging as a condition of living or whether it became
diseased I can not tell. The short and the long of it is that it soon

followed its children and its mate into eternity. Thus the pretty
fish disappeared from my aquariums, for I had given away the two
smaller ones in October.

THE ANABANTOIDEANS.

In tropical Asia and Africa, countries where a long “ dry season ”
alternates with a “ wet” one when showers are frequent, live a num-
ber of fishes with singular appendages to the branchial skeleton.
They have in common a vascular suprabranchial respiratory organ,
which is developed around the topmost joints, or epibranchials, of the
first of the branchial arches. By means of this they are able to
breathe air direct, and are consequently admirably adapted for life in
countries where the streams and ponds dry up or shrink so that ordi-
nary fishes would be deprived of a sufficient amount of oxygen in the
water. Not only are they not dependent on the supply of oxygen in
the water, but they demand more and have developed to such an
extent as to require air direct, and if prevented from obtaining such
die of asphyxia.

There are at least two familes which are so distinct as to have
been far removed from each other by some modern ichthyologists,
although by the older ones all the species were associated in the same
family. Most of them have the normal union of the pelvic bones with
the shoulder girdle by a direct connection of the respective bones.
These belong to the Gourami family (Osphromenids). Others have
the pelvic bones rather loosely connected by hgament with the shoul-
der girdle and have consequently been removed from the Acanthop-
ierygians and associated with the mullets and related fishes in the
suborder Percesoces. They form the family of Anabantids and are
best known through the Anabas scandens, in popular parlance desig-
nated the chmbing fish, and in the Malabar or Tamil language the
paumi-eyri or sennal, one signifying “tree climber.” Sometimes
united with the Osphromenids and sometimes distinguished as dis-
tinct families are two monotypic groups designated Helostomids and
Luciocephalids.

A little detail explanatory of the structure referred to is here
necessary.

The uppermost element but one of one pair (the first) of the gill-
bearing arches is pecularly modified; that is, the element (called
branchihyal) of each side, instead of being straight and solid as
in most fishes is excessively developed and provided with thin plates
or folds erect from the surface of the bone and from the roof of the
mouth to which the arch is attached. These plates, by their inter-
section, form chambers, and are lined with a vascular membrane
which is supplied with large blood vessels. There are corresponding

cavities to receive these appendages. It was formerly postulated
that this apparatus had the office of receiving and retaining supplies
ef water which should trickle down and keep the gills moist; such
was supposed to be the adaptation for the sustentation of life out of
the water. The experiments of Surgeon Day and others, however,
threw doubt upon this alleged function and tend to show (1) that
these fishes die “ when deprived of access to atmospheric air, not
from any deleterious properties either in the water or in the ap-
paratus used, but from being unable to subsist on air obtained solely
from the water, aerial respiration being indispensable;” (2) “ that
they can live in moisture out of water for lengthened periods, and
for a short and variable time in water only;” (3) “that the cavity
or receptacle does not contain water, but has a moist secreting sur-
face in which air is re-
tained for the purpose of
respiration, and it seems
probable that this air, after
having been supplied for
this purpose, is ejected by
the mouth and not swal-
lowed to be discharged per
anum.”

In fine, the two respira-
tory factors of the bran-
chial apparatus have inde-
pendent functions: (1) the — yy6.

Ng their normal function.

If, however, the fish is kept in the water and prevented from com-
ing to the surface to swallow the atmospheric air, the labyrinthiform
apparatus becomes filled with water, which can not be discharged
owing to its almost noncontractile power. There is thus no means
of emptying it, and the water probably becomes carbonized and unfit
for oxygenizing the blood, so that the whole of the respiration is thus
thrown on the branchie. This will account for the fact that when
the fish is in a state of quiescence it lives much longer than when
excited, whilst the sluggishness sometimes evinced may be due to
poisoned or carbonized blood.

Later investigations, especially those of N. J. Zograf on Polyacan-
thus in 1888, have confirmed these results.

The suprabranchial or epibranchial organ varies in complexity
528 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

with age. At first there are, as the basis, exceedingly thin bony lam-
inee, which increase in number and plication with time, till finally
they well merit the designation of labyrinthiform, if not “ labyrin-
thiform branchie,” which was conferred on them by Cuvier. The
osseous lamine are covered with a special mucous and aeriferous tis-
sue and functions as a lung. It is by means of this organ that the
fish is enabled to avail itself of a supply of air which it seeks or is
forced to avail itself by stress of circumstances.

Although occurring in “ tropical Asia and Africa,” the Anaban-
toideans are by no means found everywhere in those countries, and
their distribution indeed is remarkable. The Anabantids are more
widely distributed in Africa than in Asia, but while the Osphrome-
nids have a wide range in southern Asia and the archipelagoes, they
are limited (so far as known) to a single genus and species (J/iecra-
canthus marchii) , restricted to tributaries of a single river of western
Africa—the Ogowe. Consequently, a vast area exists between the
present headquarters of the family and the area where a single relict
survives to bear testimony to the former extension of the family.
Why fishes apparently so well fitted for the struggle of life should
have succumbed is one of the many mysteries which constantly con-
front the naturalist.

Only one of the Anabantoidean families—the Osphromenids—re-
quires notice here. Its members construct remarkable nests.

THE OSPHROMENIDS.

The Gourami family have an oblong and rather irregular body,
covered with scales which extend over the head; the head and mouth
small, the palate toothless, and the fins very diverse. Almost every
genus is distinguished by special fin modifications, but the anal always
extends farther backward than the dorsal. The ventrals are more or
less behind the roots of the pectorals and have a spine (in one genus
atrophied) and an outermost more or less elongated ray developed at
some expense to the others—that is, the others are reduced in length
or more or less suppressed. :

There is an extraordinary range of variation in the dorsal and anal
as well as ventral fins. At one extreme are the Gourami and its near
relatives, whose fins are very long and have numerous spines, and at
the other the pla-kat or fighting fish (Betta pugnax), deprived of
both dorsal and anal spines. Again, at one extreme are the Poly-
acanthi, with the completely developed ventrals (having a spine and
five rays) of an ordinary acanthopterygian fish, and at the other the
Trichogasters, with those fins each represented by a single filamentous
ray. Between such extremes are a number of intermediate forms,
which certify to the fact that such differences do not have the value
PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES. 529

they do in the case of other fishes and that the family in which they
are combined is a natural one. So far as the ventrals are involved,
the gourami is one of the intermediate types, having all the rays but
the outer filamentary one much abbreviated.

Each of the genera whose ovipositing habits are known has its own
special method for the elaboration of the nest. The simplest of these
nests 1s that formed by the 77ichogaster fasciatus; next to it is that
of the fish of paradise (Jacropodus viridi-auratus). That of the
gourami is the most complex. <A notice of the first can alone be
given here.

THE RAINBOW FISH.

The 7Trichogaster fasciatus (generally named Colisa vulgaris in the
popular accounts of it) has a wide range in the waters of India. The
ground color is greenish above, light below, and fourteen or more
oblique orange bands traverse the sides, but besides these are brilliant
colors which have gained for the fish the English name rainbow
fish and the French equiv-
alent poisson  arc-en-ciel.
It sometimes grows to a
length of about 5 inches.
but those of an inch and a
half are the most common.
The first and best account
of its nesting was given by
Paul Carbonnier in 1875.
Here is a translation which Fia. 98.—The canto ae
was originally published in a
the Annals and Magazine of Natural History for February, 1876.
The next year (1876) the author’s son, Pierre Carbonnier, gave later
observations in the Bulletin de la Société d’Acclimatation (p. 11-21).

The rainbow fish is met with in the tanks and ditches of the country watered
by the Ganges. Its length never exceeds 4 centimeters. It is one of the prettiest
of known fishes. One is agreeably surprised with the exuberance of colour that
nature has bestowed upon this little animal; but its most important peculiarity,
from a scientific point of view, is its mode of nidification.

As the spawning time approaches, the male, spreading his brilliant fins, plays
round the female, showing her his bright colours; with his long ventral filaments
he pats and touches her in all directions, until, overexcited by his caresses, she
takes to flight. I believe that all these graceful movements of the male fish,
all these amorous proceedings, influence the physical condition of the female
and aid the maturation of the ova.

The male fish then commences the preparations for oviposition. Seizing a
little conferva in his mouth, he carries it to the surface of the water. The
plant, from its greater density, would fall back very rapidly to the bottom; but
our little workman sucks in a few bubbles of air, which he divides and places
immediately beneath the plants so as to prevent them from descending. He
repeats this process several times, and thus, in the first day forms a floating

530 PARENTAL CARE AMONG FRESH-WATER FISHES.

island § centimeters in diameter. The bubbles of air are not coated with a
greasy liquid as in the case of the fish of paradise, Wacropodus viridi-auratus ;
ali those which approach sufficiently to touch, unite together and fuse into one.

The next day the male continues his provision of air, which he now accumu-
lates towards the central point. These bubbles exert a pressure from below
upwards, the consequence of which is the elevation of the vegetable disk, which,
issuing from the water, becomes converted into a sort of a dome floating on the
surface.

The nest being completed outwardly, the fish busies himself with giving it
a firmness which may protect it from shipwreck. With this view, he creeps
upon it in all directions and glides over its walls to smooth the surfaces; he
forcibly presses this felt with his muzzle and his chest. If one of the twigs
is too prominent, he seizes it and removes it or, by means of successive pushes
with his head, forces it into the interior. It is by turning and pressing the wall
from all sides that he succeeds in rounding it nicely.

The protective roof being finished, the male plays about the female, shows
her the brilliancy of his dress, touches her with his appendages, and seems to
invite her to follow him. The female then soon enters the nest. While she is
feeling its walls and examining its arrangements, the male, bent horizontally
under the entrance, turns spirally upon himself, throwing towards the summit
of the edifice the lustre of his many-coloured tints.

Speedily the female approaches the male with confidence; she applies her
head near the extremity of his anal fin, and thus traverses it as far as the
origin of the filaments; then she bends into a semicircle. The male fish, by
a like inflexion of his body, embraces her, turns her over, and presses her side,
an operation the result of which is a first emission of ova. These, from their
lightness, tend of themselves to rise; but with a foresight which can not be
too much admired, the male, in pressing the female, forms, by means of his
dorsal fin, a concave fold, a receptacle in which the ova undergo the contact of
the fecundating principles. Soon after there is a new visit of the female and a
fresh approximation of the male until the ovaries are completely evacuated.

The spawning over, the female quits the conjugal roof, leaving to the male the
care of rearing the family, a task of which he acquits himself with a truly
paternal zeal. Collecting with his mouth the ova seattered through the plant,
he raises them into the nest and arranges them in orderly fashion; if they are
too much agglomerated, he separates them by a movement of the head and com-
pels them to remain in the same plane; then he issues from the nest, and sets
himself with great activity to contract the entrance. When this operation is
completed, he goes away and swims round his edifice to examine the whole, and
not without anxiety, for he often goes to fetch fresh bubbles of air, which he
places intentionally under doubtful points or under menaced parts.

After seventy hours of incubation, the male, foreseeing that the ova require
fresh care and quite a different medium, ascends in the nest and pierces its
summit; the air bubbles escape and the dome immediately flattens upon the
water, imprisoning all the embryos, the existence of which begins to be manifest.

Fearing lest the young should escape his care, he sets to work to make a new
barrier for them. For this purpose he follows and traverses the outer margin
of the floating carpet, and pulling at it with force, separates it from the felt,
thus obtaining a sort of pendent fringe where the stray young ones will not be
able to pass; then, having got rid of all anxiety from this side, he takes his
young in his mouth and removes them to short distances, always conveying
those of the circumference toward the center.

them, and carries them back to the protective dwelling. This surveillance lasts
until the embryos, having undergone their complete evolution, have acquired
strength and agility. Their numerous and frequent flights announce to the
male the end of his troubles, which comes about eight or ten days after the
sinking of the nest.

The same pair of fish gave me three ovipositions during the summer of 1875,
each consisting on the average of 150 ova.

The embryos of the Rainbow fish undergo a series of transformations
analogous to those which I first indicated as occurring in J/acropodus. Want
of time and dread of affecting the existence of animals which are still rare pre-
vented my following this investigation with all the attention that the subject
deserves ; but I propose to resume it hereafter.

All M. Carbonnier’s observations on the fish were made in Paris, in
small aquaria containing about 15 liters, the temperature of the water
being kept at 23 to 25° C. (= 738.4° to T7.77° F.).

OF AMERICA AND GERMANY, ESPECIALLY IN THE
FIELD OF SCIENCE.¢

The rapid flight of time has again brought round the day that we
gladly set apart for presenting to our illustrious protector, His
Majesty the Emperor and King, our veneration and homage, and
for offering him, with loyal gratitude, our hearty congratulations in
the name of his Academy of Sciences, in which he retains a vivid
interest, which he has especially signified this very day by presenting
to the permanent secretary a golden chain of office.

May our knightly and warm-hearted prince continue to withstand,
as heretofore, the assaults of advancing years, and may he be enabled
to maintain enduringly and firmly that noble and lofty aim of his
political efforts—the preservation of peace and its blessings. Indeed
the past year, in which we have been forced to witness one of the most
powerful dramas in the world’s history, the first great struggle
around the shores of the Pacific Ocean, brings this wish home to us.
In the distant East there still resounds the din of the frightful war
which began last year immediately after we had here assembled for
a festival like the present. And now its convulsions approach our
own borders! What the year just begun may bring to us from these
almost inconceivable complications we know not, but one thing we
do know—that we may trust our sovereign. God bless him and
his house!

While a view of the East shows us a gloomy picture, toward the
West we see a bright and joyous one. In the heart of the great
American .Union the peoples of this terrestrial ball assembled for
a work of peace which we venture to hope may spread its blessings
as far as our own boundaries. There indeed our own country, thanks

again to the initiative of our Emporer, took an honorable position,
and in a competitive exhibit of industrial arts, particularly in the
scientific field, obtained the unqualified and freely bestowed appro-
bation not only of our American hosts, but also of all other rivals.
We again recognized where our strength hes. May we never for-
get it!

To the youthful culture of America there was contributed during
the past year, hkewise through a noble impulse of our Emperor,
a fresh memorial of our renewer and second founder, King Frederick
the Great, whose memorial day we celebrate together with this anni-
versary of our Emperor’s birth. The statue of the great king has
been set up in the capital city of that Union toward which, at the time
of its formation, he evinced deep interest and a friendly appreciation.

The fact that there are men who, as has been shown in this connec-
tion, think it necessary to find fault with everything, and, unfortu-
nately, others to whose low and hardly human intelligence nothing
seems worthy of esteem, should not trouble us. AT] this vanishes be-
fore the manly words with which the clear, wide-seeing, and nobly
thinking President of the United States welcomed the gift of our
Emperor. Seldom, indeed, has the great general, the provident
statesman, the friend of science, and the true philosopher on the
throne—Frederick the only—received so just a valuation as that from
Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the great American Republic.

It seems appropriate on this occasion to recall the attitude of Fred-
erick toward the young assemblage of States across the ocean whose
waters afford an unimpeded passage to our own shores, and to asso-
ciate with it the attitude of modern Germany toward the United
States of to-day. This may be regarded as a legacy of the King, our
renewer, reaching down as far as our own times, when thousands of
hands have grasped each other with friendly pressure from across the
sea.

George Bancroft,’ the former ambassador of the United States at
the court of Berlin, Friedrich Kapp,” and, recently, A. Pfister,° who
have drawn so exhaustively from the archives of this country that
there hardly remains anything for their successors to find, give us a
clear picture of the sentiments of Frederick the Great toward the
rising States of the Union, as of the attitude which he assumed
toward them. <A strongly woven historical bond unites the develop-

ment of the great North American confederation with that of the
Prussian Kingdom, indeed with that of the new German Empire. if
we recognize Prussia as the backbone of that Empire, and that King
Frederick in the Seven Years’ war, beginning with unsettled con-
ditions, filled out and firmly united this backbone. In truth the Seven
Years’ war was by no means limited to the Germany of that period,
Austria, and Europe. It affected as no previous war had done the
Western Hemisphere and laid there the foundation for the wide-
reaching power of the United States. England, at first in alliance
with Frederick, attacked France, the enemy of Frederick, upon the sea
and in North America, where at that time Canada and the entire
interior beyond the English coast colonies as far as the great Missis-
sipp! River and the southern shores along the Gulf of Mexico were
under French domination. After an unfortunate beginning in the
conduct of the war on the part of the English, the day of Quebec,
September 13, 1759, when two brave commanders, Wolfe and Mont-
calm, pitted themselves against each other and both lost their lives,
decided the conflict in favor of Albion. As a victor’s prize for this
battle, which was small indeed as regards the number of combatants,
but almost unexampled in its conduct and far-reaching results, the
English obtained the whole of Canada, as well as unobstructed access
to the Mississippi from the coast. “The Seven Years’ war,” says Ban-
croft* in this ‘connection, “extended the English colonies to the
Mississippi and gave Canada to England. ‘ We conquered America
in Germany,’ said the elder Pitt, ascribing to Frederick a share in
the extension of the Germanic race in the other hemisphere; and in
hike manner Frederick in his histories treats the English movement
in America and his own struggles in Europe all as one so long as
Pitt was at the helm.”

In this sudden extension of English rule over so wide an area of
American soil it is easy to recognize one of the quietly working
factors that led, a few years later, to the separation of the States of
the Union from old England. George Washington, who as colonel in
the Seven Years’ war helped to win for England this vast country
from its possessors, was the illustrious leader who afterwards freed
it from her domination and the great statesman who secured perma-
nent stability from the first fortunate successes. After the peace of
Paris, in 1763, thethirteen English colonial states became aware of the
future that lay before them—they also had proved their strength in the
“Seven Years’” or rather “ Nine Years’” war with France—and al-
most from that hour we may note their obstinate opposition to the
measures of the mother country to which they had not agreed, until,

a Wistory of the United States, Vol. X, p. 86. Boston, 1874.
536 RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY.

in the last days of 1773, the “tea party ” at Boston gave the opening
signal for separation.

There is, therefore, a connection, both in time as well as in the per-
sons concerned, between the origin of the Union and the establishment
of Prussia as the leading German state.

Now, the reason for the still closer relations that ensued between
young America and Prussia upon this historically prepared ground
arose from the behavior of England toward Frederick in the last
years of the Seven Years’ war, in which she might be reckoned as an
enemy rather than as a friend. King Frederick had not forgotten
that, and treated as feasible the propositions of the Colonial States
then struggling toward freedom in their conflict with England.
Had he been able to provide a fleet he would have made a commercial
treaty with the States while the conflict was still goingon. Again and
again he says that without a fleet he has no means of enforcing a
treaty and making it operative. He was therefore obliged to con-
tent himself with stopping the passage through Prussian territory
of the auxiliary troops England had obtained from various German
states, particularly from Hesse, and with favorably influencing to-
ward America other states, among them France and Russia. That
the young Government might grow up to be the first great Repubhe
was to the far-seeing monarch no obstacle. I need only refer in
this connection to his noteworthy commentary, in which he compares
the republican and monarchical forms of government.‘

We should take care, however, not to place too much weight upon
the expression by Frederick of favorable and friendly sentiments
toward the United States. The great king was a practical politician ;
sentimental politics were entirely out of his line. With him the
controlling principle was the welfare of his State, down to that of
his humblest subject; hence the rule that directed his conduct was
care for the intellectual elevation and education of his people. Ban-
croft’ has an excellent, brief passage on this subject: ‘“‘ No prince
could be further than Frederick from the romantic attempts to res-
cue from oppression foreign colonies that’ were beyond his reach.
* * * THis cares are for the country which he rather serves than
rules; he sees and exactly measures its weakness as well as its
strength; he cares for every one of its disconnected parts, and
gathers them all under his wings; but he connects his policy with
the movement of the world toward light and reason, the ameliora-
tion of domestic and international law.”

Yet that might and did suffice for the equally practical sense and
sober judgment of the Americans. In the United States Frederick
the Great has always remained a national figure in the best sense of

2 Oeuvres, I, 239, b Wistory of the United States, Vol. X, p. 103.
RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY. 537

the word. It is worthy of note that one of the last great political
acts of Frederick was the conclusion of a commercial and friendly
treaty with the North American Union. Although that treaty was
not renewed at the expiration of the term for which it was fixed,
this was merely because the commerce between Prussia and the Union
was so slight that there were no strong inducements for renewal.
Besides, matters in France absorbed all attention. Although Kapp
says, with somewhat harsh judgment, that statesmen like George
Washington and Hertzberg had exaggerated and confused ideas as
to the significance of this treaty, I will not hesitate to quote a few
words from letters written by Washington to Rochambeau and to
Lafayette: “ Some of the late treaties,” says the man who was soon
to be the first President of the North American Union, “ and par-
ticularly that between the King of Prussia and the United States,
seem to promise a new era in negotiation and to promise the happy
consequences I have just now been mentioning. It is the most liberal
treaty which has ever been entered into between independent powers.
It is perfectly original in many of its articles, and should its prin-
ciples be considered hereafter as the basis of connection between na-
tions, it will operate more fully to produce a general pacification
than any measure hitherto attempted amongst mankind.”* What
Washington here says is really contained in the articles of the
treaty, and since these two great contemporaries—King Frederick and
the first ruler of the Union—cooperated in this manner for a work of
peace which they conceived as such, this treaty has actually since
that time served as a pattern in all essential respects in our relations
with America and will still continue to do so.

But how greatly have these relations developed in the last one hun-
dred and twenty years! It is true that at an early period German
immigrants were already an important constituent of the population
of the United States. I recall the settlement of Germantown, in
Pennsylvania, in 1683, to-day a suburb of Philadelphia, from whence
the first protest against slavery was issued. But how greatly has the
influx of Germans increased! Right in the center of America, upon
the blessed agricultural fields of Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin,
and Minnesota, around the head waters of the Mississippi, the Ger-
mans have settled, and there most faithfully shown their national
peculiarities. Even to-day they constitute, next to the people of the
United Kingdom, the strongest stream of immigration. And, if I
may speak my thought openly, I will say that it is most desirable for
the United States that this should continue. Those who first took
possession of the land and have since cultivated it belonged to the
Germanic race. The population derived from the Romance and Sla-

a Sparks, J: The Writings of George Washington, Vol. IX, pp. 182, 194.

538 RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY.

vie races has been much less and will remain so. The intermixture
of the native born with the immigrants will proceed most quickly
and in the best manner if the latter come from states having a Ger-
manic population. Considerably more than five millions of the in-
habitants of the United States continue to speak their German
mother tongue together with English, hold German schools, hear
German church service, read German books and newspapers pub-
lished in that country, maintain German customs, and know how to
combine and preserve a love for their American fatherland with
faithful memories of their maternal home.

The commercial and intellectual interchange between us and
America amounts at the present time to millions of letters, telegrams,
and articles of merchandise, and to-day we journey as rapidly from
Berlin to New York as we did seventy years ago from Berlin to
Konigsberg. Next to the old mother country, Albion, Germany is
the land whose ties and common interests with America come first in
question and whose fostering care and requirements must above all
be near to the hearts of both countries, since it has an historical as
well as a natural foundation. The former we have endeavored to
briefly set forth; the latter is shown by the unusual increase of trade
which has developed in an entirely natural manner.

We may also go yet further and say that the relations of Germany
to the North American Union are so determined by the geographical
position and most intimate—I might almost say family—interests of
the two countries that they entirely forbid to either any conflicts ex-
cept those of a peaceful character. America and Germany are to
sach other like brothers. There may be contentions and misunder-
standings even among brothers, yet this is soon followed in the rea-
sonable course of things by the restoration of harmony. There are
really no vital antagonistic interests between the German coasts of
the North and Baltic seas and the ocean coast of America. This was
expressed by Carl Schurz on the 7th of October of last year, the Ger-
man day at St. Louis,¢ as follows:

No international friendship could be more natural than that between this
tepublic and the German Empire. There are not only the bonds of blood and
the common Germanic spirit that cement the relationship between the two
nations; there is also the complete absence of any antagonism of great inter-
ests which might separate them. In fact, no one can show a single point in
which the great interests of the two countries or even the directions of their
just ambition run counter to each other.

These two political bodies, whose development has not as yet nearly
reached the noonday height—indeed, Germany, since her unification
was the later effected, may in this sense be called the yvounger—are

«See the Westliche Post, edited by Doctor Pretorius, in St. Louis, of October
7, 1904,
RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY. 539

brought together by what I might call natural gravitation. Each
can lend to the other light and blessings of all kinds as international
comity may demand and require, and it is therefore idle and irrele-
vant to dispute as to which may hereafter be the weightiest and most
permanent organism. That rests in the bosom of time. It is enough
that, judging by human foresight, they can not injure each other.

The task which, for both peoples and states, arises from this con-
dition is that of effecting as close a union as possible and of avoiding
everything that may tend in any way to injure existing harmony, for
only so will both secure in the fullest extent the advantages which, as
ohe may say, spontaneously arise.

The relations between peoples and States are manifold, hardly to
be followed out and specified in detail. They can only be considered
in large comprehensive groups: The international political relations
and actions toward, with, and against each other; the relations with
a third party, the military relations, and above all the commercial
and industrial relations. These all deal with questions as to bare
existence. But in the lives of cultivated peoples, as soon as a cer-
tain stage of development is reached, there are engendered many
higher relations, such as those of morality and religion, art and
science. In these matters, peculiar to man alone, lies that which
makes life worth living. It is these that we are now to con-
sider, especially the scientific relations between the United States
and Germany, touching the others only in so far as they have a
scientific basis or belong to history. I must, however, entirely omit
the latter, as it would lead us much too far afield.

How should we conduct ourselves toward America in the great
domain of science? In advance I will say one thing: If two peoples
are to cooperate in the advancement of culture as also in the recipro-
cal demands of material interests, they must respect each other. Each
must have something good and self-achieved to offer, each must pre-
serve its own individuality without obtrusive ostentation, but with
quiet certainty, such as that given by the natural feeling of one’s own
health and strength. He who does not have confidence in himself
will soon lose the confidence in others. To our American brethren
sprung from German stock I make this appeal in relation to the
departments of art and science as well as those of morals and man-
ners. Do not form an exclusive clan in a great State—but be a pow-
erful root that brings healthy sap to the mighty, spreading, gigantic
tree to which we may liken the Union. In this way you will obtain
the regard as well as the full confidence of your fellow-citizens of
Anglican stock, who, changed and transformed by the climatic ex-
igencies of North America, make the nucleus of what we call the
“American nation,”

540 RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY.

You may also be of use to us by counteracting tendencies that in an
unauthorized way threaten to injure the mother country, by helping to
remove prejudices that arise there and to clear up our own misunder-
standings and unjust suspicions by pointing out the good which we
often fail to see either through prejudice or from ignorance of the
nature of the people and of the political and social institutions be-
yond the ocean. I am happy to say that this conception of the situ-
ation of the American citizen of German descent and speech pre-
vailed_as the keynote of the many demonstrations which were given
at St. Louis on “ German day,” celebrated on October 6, 1904, and
the same note agreeably sounded in my ears wherever I, in social
circles, discussed this subject with intelligent persons.

In order to properly and usefully comport ourselves in scientific
relations we must first of all know what the Americans in general
think of culture and science, what is the present condition of science
and scientific research in America, and how it is likely to be modified
in the near future.

There is widely spread among us a false prejudice that Americans
turn predominantly toward material interests and have but little
inclination to purely scientific matters. Those who hold this forget
that the most famous of the American universities, Harvard, in Cam-
bridge, Mass., with an attendance of more than 5,000 students, cele-
brated not long ago the anniversary of its establishment in 1636;
that Yale University, at New Haven, Conn., likewise highly regarded,
has had a festival celebrating the two hundredth year from its
foundation; that Princeton University, in New Jersey, Brown Uni-
versity, in Providence, R. I., and Pennsylvania University, in Phila-
delphia, are about as old as G6ttingen. Besides these, Columbia
University, in New York, which is striving in noble competition to
reach the top, was established more than seventy years ago. They
forget that in the course of from seventy to forty vears five universi-
ties of the first rank have been established—the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, in Baltimore; the Cornell University, in Ithaca, N. Y., for-
merly under the direction of the worthy Ambassador Andrew D.
White, who has recently sent us friendly regards from over sea in
his “Autobiography ;” the University of Chicago, Il., the Leland
Stanford University, Cal., and the Berkeley University, to which
belongs the renowned Lick Observatory, on Mount Hamilton, in Cali-
fornia. They especially forget the numerous great public libraries,
with their model equipment, which make it possible for everyone to
obtain intellectual food; only a few of us know how much these are
used by all classes, including the working people.

The American knows very well that culture brings freedom with
it, and that in the fierce struggle for life, in which he must either
conquer or be overcome, methodical training is necessary if he would
RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY. 541

keep his head above water. Hence the great care which we see in
America for public schools, for advanced schools of all sorts, for
museums, collections, laboratories, public lecture courses, all of which
are of an abundance excelled by only a few similar establishments
in the Old World, and in practical arrangement and facility of use
are surpassed by none of our institutions, if, indeed, ours do not
yield to them in this respect. Although their earlier progress was
rapid, that of the last ten years exceeds all expectations. It needs
no gift of prophecy to predict that in fifty years the institutions of
the Union will far surpass ours in good arrangement, ease of use,
and wealth of means offered.

Now, has anything been attained by this liberal provision for the
equipment of scientific work? This leads us to some intermediate
considerations.

The endowment of any special ability, whether bodily or mental,
is an inborn gift of nature; it can not be increased in any organ-
ization beyond the limits permitted by that organization. A math-
ematician can not be made out of a man whose brain does not pos-
sess the necessary endowment any more than a singer can be made
from anyone who is defective in the auditory centers of the brain,
in the organs of hearing, or in the larnyx. These natural endow-
ments are sometimes hereditary in families; quite often, indeed,
perhaps oftener, the reverse is the case. Neither material prosperity
nor high social position have anything to do with the production
of these endowments; on the contrary we often see capable intellects
of the first rank emerge from the great mass of the people, from
those in poor circumstances as frequently as from families that have
long enjoyed favorable conditions—a benificent, equalizing justice
of nature. It can not be denied that certain races are preferred—the
history of science teaches it. They are those which, with a generally
healthy and harmonious development of the body, possess brains
of the largest size relative to the body mass. Another factor has
doubtless an influence here; I refer to all that is generally inferred
when we use the word “climate.” Neither the excessive darkness
of the polar regions nor the flood of sunlight at the equator appears
favorable; it is in the temperate zones, in countries much diversified
by land and water, with fertile soil and a complete alternation of
seasons that we find the most favorable climatic factors. In such
countries one can not rely upon fruit dropping into the mouth; one
must work, but the work rewards and at the same time tempers the
worker. I think it is clear that the factor of climate does not work
directly. I am much more inclined to believe that it works by pro-
ducing well-built, healthy men with good brains.

Now, on the other hand, it is not the less true that a certain
already attained development of culture and institutions likely to

542 RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY.

have a favorable influence—such as good means of instruction of all
kinds, libraries, methods of tmtellectual imterchange and others—
frequently aid in the bringing forward of men of intellectual force.
That is, however, easily explained. Given two muscles equally well
organized, the one will become more efficient that is given opportu-
nity to exercise and test itself, so if we take two equally endowed
brains the one will prove the most effective to which the best intel-
lectual nourishment and the most opportunity for exercise is afforded.
How many highly endowed heads have never attained their full
working power because they were surrounded by barriers through
which they could not break? Men of true genius, like Napoleon I,
Shakespeare, Gauss, may perhaps overcome every obstacle and by
reason of their original creative force do without many things and
yet succeed, yet easily accessible aids will arouse and inspire many
capable men whose powers would otherwise remain obscure.

If we now compare * old ” Europe, as we sometimes hear it called
over there, with the United States, we find that in both regions the
climatic factor is of the highest quality, although there are in western
North America wide areas unfavorably situated, yet there are very
large portions of the country that lie as favorably and are as well
formed as any part of Europe. The human type is the same, for,
indeed, all Europe has contributed of her best to form a large part of
the population of the Union. The cultural appliances are similar
and in many respects better; America excels, as has been said, in
ease of their use and in their manifold character. With these ap-
pliances America will doubtless develop in the course of time a high
average of capable men and women in all spheres of activity. The
advantage of such an intellectual support, equal to all the growing
demands of the great whole, is to be prized much higher than that of
an equal number of men of great corporeal strength, although I
certainly do not wish to undervalue such men; there is no truer
saying than “Mens sana in corpore sano.” The truth of this saying
has, however, been recognized in the education of American youth.

It is by no means in thé natural and technical sciences alone that
the Americans have distinguished themselves. From the excellent
work of H. Miinsterberg, professor of philosophy in Harvard Uni-
versity, who is highly regarded on both sides of the ocean, we find,
together with the names of naturalists such as Audubon, Cope, Os-
borne, Marsh, Dana, Alexander Agassiz, Wolcott Gibbs, Rowland,
Newcomb, and Gould—the six last being all corresponding members
of our academy—the names of the political economists and jurists,
Charles Francis Adams and Sumner; of the historian of literature,

a4 Miinsterberg, H., Die Amerikaner. Berlin, 1904. See especially Vol. II,
chap. 20.
RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY. 543

J. Child; the orientalist, Hilprecht; the Sanscrit scholar, Whitney ;
the philologist, Hadley; the philosophers, Emerson and Royce, as
well as the historians, Bancroft, Parkman, and Charles Kendall
Adams—all of the best renown. From the imposing list of names
cited by Miinsterberg I have here selected only a few best known to
me by their works, and upon these I do not attempt to pass judgment.

To rightly understand the Americans we must remember that even
their oldest cities never had walls; that there have never been there
any of those endless petty feuds of single cities with each other and
with their overlords which, in their day, did so much to retard the
development of Germany; that they have never had imposed upon
them any compulsory feudal service or similar burdens other than
those they themselves voluntarily assumed; that the state does not
concern itself with religious creeds—there being no question of “ the
church ” as a political foree—nor do the creeds trouble themselves
about the state. All this produces a breadth of view and a feeling
of personal independence, which feeling the Americans likewise
inherit from the founders of the Republic and traditionally main-
tain in their education. This is again reflected in their great scien-
tific establishments, as an example of which we may take the Smith-
sonian Institution at Washington to show the magnificent manner in
which such views are realized.

This Institution is a scientific central station for the entire Union
and effects an exchange of writings and scientific objects with the
museums and scientific establishments of the entire world. It also
administers a museum remarkably rich in specimens relating to
natural history and ethnology, especially that of America; an astro-
physical observatory of the first rank, and a zoological garden, which,
among other objects, seeks to perpetuate those species that are threat-
ened with extinction. A considerable library of some 200,000 vol-
umes is attached to it. The executive body of the Institution, admin-
istering it under the egis of the Government, has among its members
some of the most notable men of the country. At its head is the
President of the United States for the time being. Besides about
half a million of dollars appropriated annually by Congress, the
Institution controls considerable means derived from its own re-
sources. These are used for (2 furtherance of researches of the
most various kinds, as is done by our own academies and learned
societies.

Other establishments similar to this are by no means wanting in
the United States. They have not, however, yet reached the impor-
tance enjoyed by the great academies of the Old World. The most
important and noteworthy American academy is the National Acad-
emy of Sciences. It was established in 1863, has a membership prac-
tically limited to 100 members, and has always held a very high rank.

544 RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY.

Membership in it is considered one of the highest honors that can be
attained by a scientific man. It 1s made by law the accredited
scientific adviser of the Government. Another of the more important
American academies is the Washington Academy of Sciences, which
acts as the federal head of a series of affilated societies devoted to
anthropology, archeology, general biology, botany, chemistry, ento-
mology, forestry, geography, geology, history, medicine, philosophy,
and physical sciences. There should also be mentioned the American
Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Edu-
sational Association. Besides these I will here mention the Stanford
University, at Palo Alto, Cal., as an institution of the first rank. It
was established in 1891, has an endowment valued at $40,000,000, and
has on its staff of teachers some of the first scientific men in the
United States. Its president is the eminent ichthyologist, Dr. David
Starr Jordan. Finally, I must not omit one of the youngest of the
great establishments of this kind, the Carnegie Institution, estab-
lished in 1902 by Mr. Andrew Carnegie, with an endowment of
$10,000,000. It has for its special object the furtherance of original
scientific research.

I was repeatedly able to personally satisfy myself upon the spot as
to the progress which is being made, especially in the biological sci-
ences and their application. I also had an opportunity, at the St.
Louis Exposition, of examining the educational sections in all their
‘amifications. I find that over there they are equal to us in all essen-
tial respects—in the kind and method of scientific work, in the value
of the same, in the fitting up and equipment of laboratories, in the
materials for instruction, in the style and method of imparting
knowledge. Visit the great workshop of Alexander Agassiz at Cam-
bridge; the anatomical laboratories of Huntington, in New York, at
Columbia University; and of Mallat Baltimore; the Peabody Museum
at Yale University in New Haven, so richly filled by Marsh; the
Anthropological Museum at New York, and others, and you will say
that Tam right. J. Orth recently published a similar opinion.“ Ina
few years the new buildings of the medical school of Harvard Uni-
versity will be ready, and what I saw of the plans at the St. Louis
Exposition leads me to think that in them we shall have the best yet
produced.

T have sought to give a concise sketch of what the great American
Union has done for science up to the present time and what it 1s ina
condition to offer us to-day. What should we do to maintain and
increase the natural ties that now knit together the scientific interests
of that great country and our own?

RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY. 545

If we proceed to compare the scientific capital that we possess with
that of America we find that as regards the factor of climate and the
creative and thinking human material we are about the same. The
advantage which we perhaps possess as regards the age of our mate-
rials for culture and historical background will disappear in the
course of time. Our scientific institutions are good, but we should be
careful not to restrict the free development that they have always had
hitherto, for if we do so we will quickly fall behind America. Sei-
ence and art thrive only in the open air! One thing should be men-
tioned in which America is excelled by the Old World of western
Kurope—I do not refer alone to Germany—that is in scientifie dis-
coveries and theories which open entirely new scientific domains, such
as the discovery of a surprisingly large number of new chemical ele-
ments; spectral analysis, together with astrophysics; the great discov-
eries in the chemistry of dyes and sugars, the physical chemistry of
the phenomena of solutions, the liquefaction and condensation of
gases, especially liquid air, the Réntgen and Becquerel rays, radium
and its rays, color photography, the electric dynamo, electric lighting—
indeed, most of the investigations and applications of electricity as a
source of power—the electric furnace and its application, so fruitful
in the arts; then in the field of biology, almost our entire knowledge
of the protista and of bacteriology, with the light which they throw
upon epidemiology, toxines and antitoxines, the development of the
doctrine of immunity, the discovery of the recondite phenomena of
fertilization and karyokinesis, the doctrine of descent and Darwinism,
and, crowning all, the conception and establishment of the great idea
of the conservation of energy.

These are the discoveries and theories of European investigation of
the last fifty years; many of them belong to quite recent time. In
the realm of the historical and philosophical sciences also there could
be named a great number of men and works which would easily show
that here too the preponderance of attainment still rests with Europe.
Theodor Mommsen, Moriz Haupt, Leopold von Ranke, Macaulay.
Gaston Paris, Karl Ritter, and many others of which Europe may be
proud, have indeed passed away; yet their influence is felt through-
out many schools that are continuing their work with honor. Europe
with Germany in the heart of it has retained up to the present day
its fresh and youthful vigor in intellectual work. So long as the
climatic conditions remain as favorable as at present there will be no
lack of intellectual achievement.

Certainly the education of our youth has hitherto been good, and I
do not lightly value the independence of our universities. It is by
no means desirable that they all should be made to correspond to a
common pattern; we should rather maintain their well-tested organi-
546 RELATIONS BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND GERMANY.

zations. We ought to especially oppose too great a uniformity. The
strength of an investigator, of a scholar, or of a teacher lies in the
development of individuality. Among the Germans the individual-
ity of investigators and teachers is usually well marked; this should
remain so, especially as in the United States there is a tendency to a
certain uniformity.

Although to-day the cultured states of western Europe occupy the
first place in the field of science, we should not lull ourselves to sleep
with the pleasant security that this will always continue to be so.
America’s scientific capital, as I have above endeavored to show, is
equal to ours; she is well in the way of preceding us in the culture of
the sciences. She has already produced in considerable numbers men
of the first rank whose performances were also of the first rank; others
may arise at any time. Let us then seek to keep company with America
in our pursuit of science. Let us unhesitatingly allow to the Ameri-
‘ans whatever they may have that is as good or better than ours; let
us gladly receive it from them. If then, by our own effective ability,
we preserve their regard and esteem, we shall help more and more to
strengthen in the scientific field the bond that naturally exists between
America and Germany. And now I will touch upon an important
point which at the present time is of marked interest. Hitherto
young Americans have come to us in order to learn from us, but the
time has now arrived in which the German and European students
should travel in America for the purpose of broadening their culture.
This scientific exchange from person to person, from university to
university, and from academy to academy should be favored as far as
possible. Let us be as liberal as they are to us in the reception of all
those eager for knowledge and in granting them everything that they
need. Let us place the published results of their work in our libraries,
at least in the great Royal Library of the chief city of the Empire.
Let us in all things show them that in Germany they come to a people
intellectually allied, under whose political and social institutions even
they with their free views may feel at home. Everyone who has
been their guest can say in their praise that they treat us in this
manner. Americans welcome men of science with a feeling of appre-
ciation and friendliness. So may we also, while fully guarding our
interests and our individuality, contribute much toward keeping up
the relations between the two peoples, or indeed toward knitting them
more closely together.

We should act toward America as the Americans do toward Ger-
many. We should also try to form a correct judgment of the scien-
tific work of the Americans by personal examination. We should,
more than hitherto, inform ourselves upon the spot. It would do no
harm if annually a number of German students should seek to widen
-

their horizon by a course at American universities. I also unhesita-
tingly favor the scheme already in operation for several years, and
first thoroughly agitated by our fellow-member, Mr. Harnack, of
allowing American investigators to give fuil courses at German uni-
versities, and vice versa German teachers at American ones. The
further realization of this arrangement should be hailed with joy.

In the association of academies a wider bond of union is afforded.
Our academy has always willingly met the wishes of the learned in-
stitutions of America, of which not less than forty-four have estab-
lished with us a regular exchange of publications.

May all this be looked out for, futher developed, and followed up,
in order to adapt itself to the natural tendency that, in the scientific
field, inclines us toward the United States. I do not feel called upon
to advise the Americans as to their future behavior toward us, for if
we remain at the level we now occupy they will need no advice, but
will willingly maintain and extend their old relations in the pathway
of science.

And then, aside from all other considerations, looking merely upon
science and its service, will not such an intercourse fulfill the noblest
and highest mission that comes within the province of science—the
advancement and elevation of culture from people to people ?

However, in these thoughts we only reflect the sentiments and re-
solves of our great protector, the Emperor and King, whose birthday
we here celebrate. As the history of his reign unequivocally shows,
he cherishes for the trans-Atlantic Republic the same open and
friendly feelings as did his great ancestor. We can to-day offer no
more suitable wish than this: That the noblest aspirations of both
peoples, carrying blessings in their train, may be fulfilled.

There is yet another wish that is near our hearts to-day, which,
with due respect, we may be allowed to express. His Imperial High-
ness the Crown Prince of the German Empire and of Prussia has
contracted an engagement with a noble princess, who will be called
to stand by his side during life while he accomplishes the lofty task
which will in the future be assigned to him. May hope and peace,
health and blessings attend the imperial and royal pair.

WALTER REED.

A Memorr.

By WALTER D. McCaw.

It is given to but few scientific men to lay bare a secret of nature
materially affecting the prosperity of nations and the lives, fortunes,
and happiness of thousands. Fewer still succeed in so quickly con-
vincing brother scientists and men in authority of the truth of their
discoveries, that their own eyes behold the glorious result of their
labor.

Of the fifty-one years of Walter Reed’s industrious, blameless life,
twelve only were spent in the study of the special branch of science
in which he became famous, but his name now stands with those of
Jenner, Lister, and Morton as among the benefactors of humanity.

Walter Reed was born in Gloucester County, Va., September 13,
1851, the son of the Rev. Lemuel Sutton Reed and Pharaba White,
his wife.

The circumstances of his family were modest, and some of the
years of his boyhood were spent in a much-troubled section of the
South during the great civil war. He acquired, however, a good
preliminary education, and at an age when most boys are still
in the schoolroom, he began the study of medicine at the University
of Virginia, graduating as M. D. in 1868, when only 17 years old.

A second medical degree was received later from Bellevue Medical
College, New York, and then came terms of service in the Brooklyn
City Hospital and the City Hospital, Blackwells Island.

Before the age of 21, Reed was a district physician in New York
City, and at 22 one of the five inspectors of the board of health of
Brooklyn.

He entered the Army of the United States as assistant surgeon
with the rank of first leutenant in 1875, and for the next eighteen
years, with the usual varying fortunes of a young medical officer of

mission,

the Army, he served in Arizona, Nebraska, Dakota, and in the South-
ern and Eastern States.

According to the exigencies of the service he was moved frequently
from station to station, everywhere recognized by men of his own age
as a charming and sympathetic companion, and by older officers as
an earnest and intelligent physician whose industry, fidelity to duty,
and singularly good judgment gave brilliant promise for the future.
In the poor cabins and dugouts of the pioneers in the sparsely settled
districts where he served his flag Reed was ever,a messenger of heal-
ing and comfort. At that time army posts on the frontier were
usually remote and with small garrisons. The young medical officer,
generally the only one at the station, was called upon by the settlers
for miles around. Without help, and with only such instruments
and medicines as could be hastily stuffed in his saddlebag, he was
summoned to attend a fractured thigh, a child choking withgsdiph-
theria, or, most trying of all, a complicated childbirth.

Such experience schools well in self-reliance, and in the formation
of quick and accurate observation.

For a man like Reed, already an earnest student, no better prepara-
tion could perhaps have been had. His earlier army service must
have singularly tended to develop in him the very qualities most nec-
essary to his final success. To the end of his life it was noticeable
that even when he had long given up the practice of medicine for the
work of the laboratory, he was nevertheless unexcelled at the bedside
for rapid, unerring diagnosis and sound judgment in treatment. So
also were the series of experiments which robbed yellow fever of its
terrors especially remarkable for simplicity, accuracy, and complete-
ness, or they never would have so quickly convinced the world of
their truth. Too much reverence for accepted teachings and too lht-
tle experience in grappling with difficulties unassisted and they
might never have been conceived or carried out.

In 1890 he was assigned to duty in Baltimore and remained there
over a year. Here he had the great advantage of working in the
laboratories of Johns Hopkins University and the happiness of win-
ning the close friendship of his distinguished teacher, Prof. William
H. Welch.

In 1893 Reed was promoted surgeon with the rank of major, and
in the same year was detailed in Washington as curator of the Army
Medical Museum and professor of bacteriology at the newly organized
Army Medical School. Here he worked industriously at his spe-
cialty and wrote many valuable monographs, all characterized by
accuracy and originality. His excellent judgment made him espe-
cially valuable in investigating the causes of epidemic diseases at
military posts and in making sanitary inspections. He was therefore
frequently selected for such work, which, with his duties as teacher
WALTER REED. nay b

and member of examining boards, occupied much of the time that
he would otherwise have spent in his laboratory. Here again it
seems that duties which must often have been irksome were specially
fitting him for his culminating work.

During the Spanish-American war the camps of the volunteer
troops in the United States were devastated by typhoid fever, and
Major Reed was selected as the head of a board to study the causa-
tion and spread of the disease. This immense task occupied more
than a year’s time. With the utmost patience and accuracy the
details of htndreds of individual cases were grouped and _ studied.
The report of the commission, now in course of publication by the
Government, is a monumental work which must always serve as
a basis for future study of the epidemiology of typhoid fever.

The most original and valuable work of the board is the proof
that the infection of typhoid fever is spread in camps by the com-
mon fly and by contact with patients and infected articles—clothing,
tentage, and utensils—as well as by contaminated drinking water.

In June, 1900, Major Reed was sent to Cuba as president of a board
to study the infectious diseases of the country, but more especially yel-
low fever. Associated with him were Acting Asst. Surgs. James Car-
roll, Jesse W. Lazear, and A. Agramonte.

At this time the American authorities in Cuba had for a year and
a half endeavored to diminish the disease and mortality of the Cuban
towns by general sanitary work, but while the health of the popula-
tion showed distinct improvement and the mortality had greatly
diminished, yellow fever apparently had been entirely unaffected by
these measures. In fact, owing to the large number of nonimmune
foreigners, the disease was more frequent than usual in Habana and
in Quemados, near the camp of American troops, and many valuable
lives of American officers and soldiers had been lost.

Reed was convinced from the first that general sanitary measures
alone would not check the disease, but that its transmission was
probably due to an insect.

The fact that malarial fever, caused by an animal parasite in the
blood, is transmitted from man to man through the agency of cer-
{ain mosquitoes had been recently accepted by the scientific world;
also, several years before, Dr. Carlos Finlay, of Habana, had ad-
vanced the theory that a mosquito conveyed the unknown cause of
yellow fever, but did not succeed in demonstrating the truth of his
theory.

Dr. H. R. Carter, of the Marine-Hospital Service, had written a
paper showing that although the period of incubation of yellow
fever was only five days, yet a house to which a patient was carried
did not become infected for from fifteen to twenty days.

To Reed’s mind this indicated that the unknown infective agent has
55g WALTER REED.

to undergo a period of incubation of from ten to fifteen days, and
probably in the body of a biting insect.

Up to this time the most generally accepted theory as to the causa-
{ion of yellow fever was that of Sanarelli, who claimed that the
bacillus icteroides, discovered by him, was the specific agent of the
disease. Major Reed, in association with Doctor Carroll, had, how-
ever, already demonstrated that this bacillus was one widely dissemi-
nated in the United States and bore no special relation to vellow fever.

In June, July, and August, 1900, the commission gave their entire
attention to the bacteriological study of the blood of yellow-fever
patients and the post-mortem examination of the organs of those
dying with the disease. In 24 cases where the blood was repeat-
edly examined, as well as in 11 carefully studied autopsies, bacillus
icteroides was not discovered nor was there any indication of the
presence in the blood of a specific cause of the disease.

Application was made to Gen. Leonard Wood, the military gov-
ernor of Cuba, for permission to conduct experiments on nonimmune
persons and a liberal sum of money requested for the purpose of re-
warding volunteers who would submit themselves to experiment.

It was indeed fortunate that the military governor of Cuba was
a man who by his breadth of mind and special scientific training
could readily appreciate the arguments of Major Reed as to the
value of the proposed work.

Money and full authority to proceed were promptly granted, and
to the everlasting glory of the American soldier, volunteers from the
Army offered themselves for experiment in plenty, and with the
utmost fearlessness.

Before the arrangements were entirely completed, Doctor Carroll, a
member of the commission, allowed himself to be bitten by a mos-
quito that twelve days previously had filled itself with the blood
of a yellow-fever patient. He suffered from a very severe attack,
and his was the first experimental case. Doctor Lazear also experi-
mented on himself at the same time, but was not infected. Some
days later, while in the yellow-fever ward, he was bitten by a mos-
quito and noted the fact carefully. He acquired the disease in its
most terrible form and died a martyr to science and a true hero.

No other fatality occurred among the brave men who, in the course
of the experiments, willingly exposed themselves to the infection of
the dreaded disease.

A camp was especially constructed for the experiments about 4
miles from Habana, christened Camp Lazear in honor of the dead
comrade. The inmates of the camp were put into most rigid quar-
zntine and ample time was allowed to eliminate any possibility of
the disease being brought in from Habana.
WALTER REED. 5538

The personnel consisted of three nurses and nine nonimmunes, all
in the military service, and included two physicians.

From time to time Spanish immigrants, newly arrived, were
brought in directly from the immigrant station; a person not known
to be immune was not allowed to leave camp, or if he did was for-
bidden to return.

The most complete record was kept of the health of every man to
be experimented upon, thus eliminating the possibility of any other
disease than yellow fever complicating the case.

The mosquitoes used were specially bred from the eggs and kept in
a building screened by wire netting. When an insect was wanted for
an experiment it was taken into a yellow-fever hospital and allowed
to fill itself with the blood of a patient; afterwards at varying inter-
vals from the time of this meal of blood it was purposely applied to
nonimmunes in camp.

In December five cases of the disease were developed as the result of
such applications; in January, three, and in February, two, making
in all ten, exclusive of the cases of Doctors Carroll and Lazear. Im-
mediately upon the appearance of the first recognized symptoms of
the disease, in any one of these experimental cases, the patient was
taken from Camp Lazear to a yellow-fever hospital, 1 mile distant.
Every person in camp was rigidly protected from accidental mos-
quito bites, and not in a single instance did yellow fever develop in
the camp, except at the will of the experimenters.

The experiments were conducted at a season when there was the
least chance of naturally acquiring the disease, and the mosquitoes
used were kept active by maintaining them at a summer temperature.

A completely mosquito-proof building was divided into two com-
partments by a wire screen partition; infected insects were liberated
on one side only. A brave nonimmune entered and remained long
enough to allow himself to be bitten several times. He was attacked
by yellow fever, while two susceptible men in the other compartment
did not acquire the disease, although sleeping there thirteen nights.
This demonstrates in the simplest and most certain manner that the
infectiousness of the building was due only to the presence of the
insects.

Every attempt was made to infect individuals by means of bedding,
clothes, and other articles that had been used and soiled by patients
suffering with virulent yellow fever.

Volunteers slept in the room with and handled the most filthy
articles for twenty nights, but not a symptom of yellow fever was
noted among them, nor was their health in the slightest degree
affected. Nevertheless they were not immune to the disease, for
some of them were afterwards purposely infected by mosquito bites.

554 WALTER REED.

This experiment indicates at once the uselessness of destroying valu-
able property for fear of infection. Had the people of the United
States known this one fact a hundred years ago an enormous amount
of money would have been saved to householders.

Besides the experimental cases caused by mosquito bite, four
nonimmunes were infected by injecting blood drawn directly from
the veins of yellow-fever patients in the first two days of the disease,
thus demonstrating the presence of an infectious agent in the blood
ut this early period of the attack.

Even the blood serum of a patient, passed through a bacteria-proof
filter, was found to be capable of causing yellow fever in another
person. :

The details of the experiments are most interesting, but it must
here suffice to briefly sum up the principal conclusions of this admi-
rable board of investigators, of which Reed was the master mind:

1. The specific agent in the causation of yellow fever exists in the blood of
a patient for the first three days of his attack, after which time he ceases to
be a menace to the health of others.

2. A mosquito of a single species, Stegomyia fasciata, ingesting the blood of
a patient during this infective period is powerless to convey the disease to
another person by its bite until about twelve days have elapsed, but can do so
thereafter for an indefinite period, probably during the remainder of its life.

3. The disease can not in nature be spread in any other way than by the bite
of the previously infected Stegomyia. Articles used and soiled by patients do
not carry infection.

These conclusions pointed so clearly to the practical method of
exterminating the disease that they were at once accepted by the
sanitary authorities in Cuba and put to the test in Habana, where for
nearly a century and a half by actual record the disease had never
failed to appear annually.

In February, 1901, the chief sanitary officer in Habana, Maj. W. C.
Gorgas, Medical Department, U. S. Army, instituted measures to
eradicate the disease, based entirely on the conclusions of the commis-
sion. Cases of yellow fever were required to be reported as promptly
as possible, the patient was at first rigidly isolated, and immediately
upon the report a force of men from the sanitary department visited
the house. All the rooms of the building and of the neighboring
houses were sealed and fumigated to destroy the mosquitoes present.
Window and door screens were put up, and after the death or recoy-
ery of the patient his room was fumigated and every mosquito de-
stroyed. A war of extermination was also waged against mosquitoes
in general, and an energetic effort was made to diminish the number
bred by draining standing water, screening tanks and vessels, using
petroleum on water that could not be drained, and in the most sys-
tematic manner destroying the breeding places of the insects,
WALTER REED. 555

When the warm season returned a few cases occurred. but by Sep-
tember, 1901, the last case of yellow fever originated in Habana,
since which time the city has been entirely exempt from the terrible
disease that had there kept stronghold for a hundred and fifty years.
Cases are now admitted into Habana from Mexican ports, but are
treated under screens with perfect impunity in the ordinary city hos-
pitals. The crusade against the insects also caused a very large de-
crease in malarial fevers.

The destruction of the most fatal epidemic disease of the Western
Hemisphere in its favorite home city is but the beginning of the bene-
fit to mankind that may be expected to follow the work of Reed and
his associates. There can be no manner of doubt should Mexico,
Brazil, and the Central American Republics, where the disease still
exists, follow strictly the example set by Habana that yellow fever
will become extinct and the United States forever freed from the
scourge that has in the past slain thousands of our citizens and caused
the loss of untold treasure.

More recent investigations into the cause and spread of yellow
fever have only succeeded in verifying the work of Reed and his
commission in every particular and in adding very little to our knowl-
edge of the disease.

Later researches by Guiteras in Habana, by the Public Health
and Marine-Hospital Service in Veracruz, and lastly by a delegation
from the Pasteur Institute of Paris in Rio de Janeiro all confirm
in the most convincing manner both the accuracy and comprehensive-
ness of the conclusions of the American commission. It.has been
well said that Reed’s experiments “ will always remain as models in
the annals of scientific research, both for the exactness with which
they were adapted to the points to be proved and the precautions
taken that no experiment should be vitiated by failure to exclude
all possible sources of error.”

Appreciation of Reed’s work was instant in the scientific world.
Honorary degrees from Harvard University and the University of
Michigan were conferred upon him, learned societies and distin-
guished men delighted to honor him, and after his death Congress
voted a special pension to his widow.

To the United States the value of his services can not be estimated.
Ninety times has yellow fever invaded the country, carrying death
and destruction, leaving poverty and grief.

New Orleans, Memphis, Charleston, Galveston, Portsmouth, Balti-
more, Philadelphia, New York, and many smaller towns have been
swept by the disease.

The epidemic of 1853 cost New Orleans 8,000 lives; that of 1793
wiped out 10 per cent of Philadelphia’s population.
556 WALTER REED.

The financial loss to the United States in the one epidemic of 1878
was estimated as amounting to $15,333,000; but suffering, panic,
fear, and the tears of widows and orphans can never be estimated.
Now, however, if yellow fever should again cross our southern bor-
der there need be no disturbance of commerce or loss of property im
the shghtest degree comparable with that which epidemics in the past
have caused.

The death of Major Reed took place November 23, 1902, in Wash-
ington, from appendicitis. It is gratifying to think that, although
his country and the scientific world were deprived of one from whose
Tuture services more benefit to humanity might reasonably be ex-
pected, nevertheless he was privileged before his life’s close to know
that his discovery had been tested and that a great city was freed
from her ancient foe, to know that his conscientious work had con-
tributed immeasureably toward the future prospects of an infant
Republic, and even more to the welfare of his own beloved country,
whose flag he had served so faithfully.

In the national capital and in the great cities of the United States
there are stately monuments to the country’s great ones. Statues of
warriors, statesmen, and patriots stand as silent witnesses of a peo-
ple’s gratitude. Is there not room for the effigy of Walter Reed,
who so clearly pointed out to his fellowman the way to conquer
America’s worst plague ¢

RUDOLPH ALBERT VON KOLLIKER, M. D..

Professor of anatomy in the University of Wiireburg.

By WILLIAM STIRLING,

Professor of physiology and histology, and dean of medical school, University of
Manchester, England.

The death of Professor Koélliker was announced in the British
Medical Journal of November 11. The venerable scientist died on
November 3, of pneumonia, after an illness of thirty-six hours.

The name of Kolliker has been familiar to all histologists and
anatomists for nearly half a century, for there is scarcely any depart-
ment of histology to which he did not contribute largely by his
original work. The whole animal kingdom was laid under contribu-
tion, and his contributions dealt both with the structures as they
appear in adults and with tissues and organs in their development.

Born at Zurich in 1817, just four years after the birth of Claude
Bernard, K6lliker began his studies in the university of his native
town in 1836. In 1839 he proceeded to Bonn, and later in the same
year to Berlin, where he became a pupil of Johannes Miiller, who
exercised a profound influence on the young and ardent student.
Miiller’s wide survey of physiology led Kélliker to take the same
broad view of histology. He took the degree of doctor of philosophy
at Zurich in 1841, and because that university insisted on a viva voce
examination when he presented a dissertation for a medical degree,
he elected to take his degree in Heidelberg in 1842, presenting on the
occasion a thesis on the development of Chironomus and Donacia.

Schleiden, of Jena, published his work on vegetable cells in 1838,
and Schwann his cell theory in 1839. In the memoir entitled ‘ Mi-
croscopical researches into the accordance in the structure and growth
of animals and plants,” the cell theory was formulated. Ko6lhker was
thus fortunate in finding a field of research which he cultivated with
such marvelous success that up to 1899, when he published Erinner-
ungen aus meinen Leben, when he was over 80 years of age, the total
number of his papers is given as 245, most of them on histological

and allied subjects. At Zurich he listened to the stimulating lee-
tures of Oken on zoology; in 1839, in Bonn, he attended the clinic of
Nasse, who gave his lectures in Latin. The future anatomist tells
how at the clinic at Bonn he was unable to find the vein in the arm
of a very fat lady patient who was ordered to be bled. The turn-
ing point in his career came in Berlin in 1839, where he fell under
the spell of Johannes Miiller and Jakob Henle, whose influence on
him was powerful. Under Miiller he studied comparative anatomy
and pathological anatomy, and under Henle normal histology.
Henle instilled into him the epoch-marking doctrines of Schwann
and directed his attention to the microscopical structure of the body.
There also he got much encouragement from Ehrnberg, Meyen, and
Robert Remak. He took a private course under Remak, who gave
lectures and demonstrations at his own house on “ Development of
the chick.” This led in future years to a study of development in
mammals and many other animals and to the publication in 1861 of
his Entwicklungsgeschichte des Menschen und der héheren Thiere.

Kolliker tells how, at his Staats-examen, he knew all about the
finest branches of the cranial nerves, the structure of the ear, brain,
and eye, yet he could not answer a simple question on the portal
vein. In the session of 1841-42 he became assistant to Henle, who at
that time was professor of anatomy at Zurich. In 1842 began the
first of a series of journeys to other lands, which were always utilized
for scientific purposes. The first was undertaken with Nagel to
Naples, where he devoted his time to comparative anatomy of aquatic
forms, a subject which began to be studied in the thirties and forties
by Stannius, W. Peters, J. Miiller, Milne-Edwards, and Quatrefages.
While there he made eight researches in all, on amphioxus, ceph-
alopoda, on the hectocotylus of Argonauta, and kindred subjects.
After Henle left Zurich in 1844 to go to Heidelberg the chair in
Zurich was divided, and Kolliker, at the age of 27, became professor
of physiology and comparative anatomy, with an income of 1,200
francs. In 1847, when 30 years of age, he was called to Wiirzburg,
largely through the influence of Henle and the then rector, Professor
Rinecker. Originally at Heidelberg he taught physiology, but IXol-
liker made it a condition that as soon as the chair of anatomy be-
‘ame vacant he was to have it, for he desired to devote himself to
microscopical anatomy. During the Zurich period he published
papers on the Pacinian corpuscles, the tissues of the tadpole, inde-
pendence of the sympathetic nervous system, development of Ceph-
alopoda, on blood, spermatozoa, and the structure of smooth muscle.
By the use of nitric acid he showed that smooth muscle is made up
of fusiform cells. He also found that cellulose existed in the skin
of tunicates.
RUDOLPH ALBERT VON KOLLIKER, M. D. 5D

At Wirzburg he taught physiology, and added to this microscopic
anatomy and development, so that in 1849, when the chair of anat-
omy became vacant, he taught all these subjects and was the head of
two institutes. Kolliker, in his first decennium in Wiirzburg, was
particularly fortunate in his associates and assistants, for he had as
friends the gifted Heinrich Miiller. Carl Gegenbaur, and Franz
Leydig. Professor Rinecker had a microscopical institute, with
Franz Leydig as an assistant, but Kolliker gave the first micro-
scopical course in 1848. On the death of Heinrich Miiller, in 1864,
physiology was separated from anatomy, and Prof. A. von Bezold
was called to fill the chair of physiology.

In 1849 Kolhiker had as prosecutor Gottfried von Siebold, and in
the same year these two founded and edited the Zeitschrift fiir
wissenschaftliche Zoologie. Many papers on zoological subjects were
contributed by him to this journal. Among his later assistants were
Eberth, Forel, C. Hasse, M. Flesch, R. Fick, Grenacher, Eimer,
M. v. Lenhossék, M. Heidenhain, and Ph. Stohr, who succeeded him
on his retirement from active duty as an anatomist in 1897, when he
had completed his eightieth year and his fiftieth as an active pro-
fessor of anatomy. He still retained what he called his second in-
stitute, namely, that for comparative anatomy, microscopy, and
embryology.

Kolliker, on arriving in Wiirzburg, found the want of a scientific
society, and to him was largely due the foundation, in 1849, of the
well-known Die physikalisch-medicinische Gesellschaft in Wiirzburg.

As showing the width of his training Ko6lliker lectured on human
anatomy, physiology, comparative anatomy, gave a microscopical
course on normal histology, and lectures on topographical histology
and comparative histology, and also courses on embryology—human
and comparative. He also gave short courses on comparative anat-
omy and physiology and on topographical anatomy.

Kolliker, of course, was the recipient of many honors. In 1897
there was conferred on him the title * Excellenz ” by Prince Luitpold
of Bavaria. Only once, however, was he rector of his university, and
he did not take any very active part in the inner academic life.

In early youth Kolliker was a great gymnast and indulged largely
in manly sports. He was a keen sportsman, especially as a hunter.
He also was a great climber, and he records that in 1837 there was
not an inn in Zermatt. Sie tempora mutantur.

He also traveled much and was a splendid linguist. English he
spoke with-great fluency, and he was a great admirer of English life
and English ways. French and Italian he knew well, and he pub-
lished papers in all three languages. In 1840 he visited Heligoland
and worked up the fauna of the surrounding sea, for most of his
560 RUDOLPH ALBERT VON KOLLIKER, M. D.

visits had a scientific object. Naples and Sicily were visited in 1842.
In 1845 he first visited London, and on his way stopped at Louvain
to make the acquaintance of Schwann and Van Beneden. In Lon-
don he made the acquaintance of Sharpey, who was then professor
in University College. A close friendship sprang up between them,
and Kolliker had the highest regard for Sharpey, who was greatly
interested in the young histologist, who demonstrated to Sharpey the
termination of nerves in Pacinian corpuscles. He also became the
friend of Owen, Bowman, Todd, Kiernan, Wharton Jones, and Ed.
Forbes. Spain was visited in 1849, Holland, England, and Scotland
in 1850. To London he was accompanied by Czermak. In Edin-
burgh he was the guest of Goodsir and Simpson.

In his letters he gives a charming account of the Edinburgh profes-
sors of those days. He says he knows only three anatomists and
physiologists in all England who do not practice medicine for a pro-
fession, namely, Owen, Sharpey, and Grant. He placed Sharpey and
Bowman at the head of English microscopists. When he and Czer-
mak were the guests of Goodsir in Edinburgh, Goodsir gave him Tom
Jones to read in bed. When he was tired he got up and blew out the
gas, but fortunately he did not fall asleep just at once. The smell of
the gas aroused him, else the career of the young histologist might
probably have been short. He was present at the meeting of the
British Association in Glasgow in 1855 as the guest of Allen Thom-
son, and on that occasion read several papers. He made another
visit to Scotland in 1857 and again in 1861. He delivered the Croon-
ian lecture in 1862. He visited Manchester to see the histological
work of the late Professor Williamson on fossil plants. In 1887 he
visited Pavia to study under Golgi his method of preparing sections
of the nervous system, though he was then already 70 years of age.
He published about twenty papers on the results he obtained on the
nervous system by the Golgi and Cajal methods.

To give a detailed account of Kolliker’s work would be to write a
treatise on comparative histology. His Gewebelehre was published
from 1850 to 1854. His Handbuch der Gewebelehre was first pub-
lished in 1852 and reached its sixth edition in 1893-1899. The Man-
ual of Human Histology was translated by Busk and Huxley for the
Sydenham Society in 1853-54. Even as late as 1851 Virchow held to
Schwann’s doctrine of * free cell formation.” Before this Kolliker
had rejected this theory. His studies on the eggs of cephalopods had
shown him the untenable nature of Schwann’s views. He attached
great importance to the study of protozoa and the simplest animals.

Kolhiker published but little on ordinary naked-eye anatomy. His
work lay chiefly in microscopical studies. He was an excellent lec-
turer, good draftsman, and a most methodical teacher. For eighteen
RUDOLPH ALBERT VON KOLLIKER, M. D. 561

years he taught physiology, and admits that the physical and chem-
ical side of this subject were left somewhat in the background. His
microscopical course was largely attended and was given in the
evening; each meeting lasted two hours. He regarded the incisures
of Lantermann, the funnels and spirals of Golgi, and the Ewald-
Kitihne networks in nerve fibers as artificial and produced by the
action of reagents. He supported Ranvier’s view of the outgrowths
of nerve fibers from a nerve cell.

That he.did not do more work in naked-eye anatomy, and, in fact,
produced only one large work on this subject, On the Position of the
Internal Female Sexual Organs (1882), he explains: by the fact that
his scientific activity fell at a time when microscopical anatomy and
embryology were in their infancy. Comparative anatomy he was
fond of, partly because it stood in such intimate relation to the Dar-
winian theory, a theory which he subjected to keen criticism.

K6lliker made many important observations in physiology. He
studied the action of poisons such as curare, strychnine, veratrin,
upas antiar, and conium. He was specially interested in curare, for
in 1856 he showed that there were poisons that, although they para-
lyzed intramuscular nerves, left the excitability of the muscle tissue
itself intact. He published his researches on curare before those of
Bernard were published. He also extended the study of poisons to
other muscular tissues, such as the heart. The emission of light by
Lampyris and Noctilucd was carefully studied. He also made some
experiments on the electrical condition of the heart and on the sec-
ondary contraction resulting when a nerve of a nerve-muscle prep-
aration is laid ou a beating heart. .

On embryology he published his great work in 1861, of which a
second edition appeared in 1879. His Grundriss, on the same sub-
ject, reached a second edition in 1884.

Many papers were published on bone; the most elaborate and the
best illustrated is * Die normale Resorption des Knochengewebes und
ihre Bedeutung fiir die Entstehung der typischen Knochenformen,”
1873. In 1872 he coined the word “ osteoclast ” in lieu of Robin’s word
“ myéloplaque,” and linked up their function with the production of
Howship’s lacune.

To the subject of Darwinism he contributed several papers, and he
gives in his Erinnerungen a broad and excellent account of the
doctrine of descent as it affects the cellular and other elements of the
body.

Classifying his published papers, we find that on histology he pub-
lished 108, including in this number his various text-books and their
editions; on anatomy, 2; physiology, 16; embryology, 52; Dar-
wWinism, 5; comparative anatomy and zoology, 19, including his
562 RUDOLPH ALBERT VON KOLLIKER, M. D.

Teones Histologice and 5 papers on unelassified subjects. This
gives a measure of the variety of his work, but not of its importance.
He continued to produce good scientific work until a very short time
before his death.

When the writer first made the acquaintance of Kolliker his hair
was already white—not so much with age, for it appears that his
hair changed its color rapidly. This gave to his suave and noble
face a pleasant and reverend appearance, which, coupled with a
charming manner, made Kolliker an attractive personality, while
his great knowledge, keen interest in all that was new, and his vast
experience made him a veritable Gamahel at whose feet it was a
pleasure to sit and easy to gain inspiration «ad profit.

Dr. J. Dulberg (Manchester) writes:

When I was at Wiirzburg some sixteen years ago or so, K6liker was still, in
spite of his advanced age, one of the most indefatigable workers in the medical
school, and it was a real pleasure to listen to him when either lecturing or dem-
onstrating. It was touching to see the solicitude with which he used to arrange
his microscopical specimens with his own hand and the pride he took in them.
Ou one occasion, particularly, I remember he kept me for over a quarter of an
hour discussing the merits of a section of the spinal cord which he told me was
the finest he had eyer seen. He examined me in anatomy for the “ doctor
examen,” but instead of asking me questions he spent nearly the whole of the
time allotted to me in giving me a miniature lecture on some anatomical detail.
Hiyven in his ordinary conversation he would not forget that he was an anatomist.
When I went to say good-by to him before leaving Wiirzburg he presented me
with his photograph, which stands before me as I write, and in doing so pointed
out to me that the photographer had exaggerated the activity of his corrugator

supercillii. As a teacher Kélliker was kind, patient, and helpful, far more than -

the generality of German professors, and to foreigners he was particularly
attentive. What an army of doctors all over the world there must be to mourn
the loss of one who has been a teacher for well-nigh three generations!
