1965

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION FOR THE YEAR
ENDED JUNE 30, 1965, INCLUDING THE
PINANCIAL REPORT, OF .THE , EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
Washington 1965
With this, the first issue of the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution to appear under the general title THE SMITHSONIAN
YEAR, certain changes have been instituted in the procedures pertaining to
Smithsonian annual reports:

1. The Annual Report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution (now
THE SMITHSONIAN YEAR) will no longer be followed by the green-
bound volume containing the General Appendix of articles in the sciences
and the arts. The last of the old series is that for 1964.

2. The objectives of the General Appendix, according to present plans, will be
met by an annual volume in the nature of a Smithsonian yearbook, an
anthology of distinguished and important contributions to the sciences and
the arts written by authorities in their fields and presented for the general
reader. The first of these yearbooks will appear in the spring of 1966 and
may be purchased. It will contain the eleven addresses delivered at the
scholarly sessions of the Smithson Bicentennial Celebration held in Wash-
ington in September 1965.

3. The Report of the United States National Museum will no longer be issued
initially as a separate document but incorporated in THE SMITH-
SONIAN YEAR together with the reports of the other branches of the
Smithsonian. Reprints of each of the agency reports will be available.

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson,
of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United
States of America ‘“‘to found at Washington, under the name
of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.” In receiving the
property and accepting the trust, Congress determined that the
Federal Government was without authority to administer the
trust directly, and, therefore, constituted an ‘‘establishment,”’
whose statutory members are ‘‘the President, the Vice President,
the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments.”

Music on the Mall for summer visitors to Washington and the Smithsonian

is heralded by tower music—trumpets playing on the north portico of the
Smithsonian Building.

An audience of 12,000 at a Music on the Mall concert in summer 1965 heard
the National Symphony Orchestra, under Howard Mitchell, play Aaron
Copeland’s Lincoln Portrait. ‘The late Ambassador to the United Nations,

Adlai E. Stevenson, was narrator.

Statement by the Secretary

S. Ditton RieLey

In presenting this report in the year 1965, which marks the two-
hundredth anniversary of the birth of James Smithson, it is
appropriate to turn back to some of the thoughts of Joseph
Henry, the first Secretary, who labored to make the Institution
truly a center for “enlarging the bounds of human thought.”
This year it has been my privilege, representing the Institution,
to testify before a Congressional Subcommittee on Science,
Research, and Development on the subject of the National
Science Foundation. One of the topics of that testimony was
the increasing need for supporting basic rather than applied
research. In 1854 Professor Henry was much concerned about
the state of the increase of knowledge in America, one of the
foundation stones of James Smithson’s famous will. Joseph
Henry felt that comparatively little encouragement was being
given to the “‘increase”’ of knowledge. As he wrote: “As soon
as any branch of science can be brought to bear on the neces-
sities, conveniences, or luxuries of life, it meets with encourage-
ment and reward. Not so with the discovery of the incipient
principles of science. The investigations which lead to these
receive no fostering care from government, and are considered
by the superficial observer as trifles unworthy the attention of
those who place the supreme good in that which immediately
administers to the physical necessities or luxuries of life.”

As he further stated, the Institution has “two fundamental
maxims . . . to do nothing with its funds which can equally
well be done by other means; and, second, to produce results
which, as far as possible, will benefit mankind in general”
(hence our interest in basic research). What then are the ac-
tivities with which the Smithsonian staff feels it can primarily
concern itself and what have been some of the results in the past
year?

789-427—_66——_3
2 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

In the science field noteworthy activities of the Museum of
Natural History staff included the following:

In a paper to be published in a forthcoming issue of Deep Sea
Research the first occurrence of a deepwater coral structure out-
side of the North Atlantic is recorded. ‘This structure was dis-
covered by Dr. Donald F. Squires in the Sub-Antarctic Islands
of New Zealand while he was cooperating with the New Zealand
Oceanographic Institute’s oceanographic program in that region.
Coupling his knowledge of living coral structures of the eastern
coast of the United States with study of the deepwater fossil
structure in New Zealand, Dr. Squires was able to postulate
sequences in the development of the coral structure. Stages of
development lead from a colony of coral up to several meters in
diameter through the accumulation of dead skeletal material and
living animals in distinctive communities to form a coral bank
several kilometers in diameter and as high as 50-60 meters.
Intermediate stages of development, termed “thicket”? and
“coppice,” have been identified in the fossil record.

Several important scientific discoveries were made by the
department of mineral sciences during the past year. These
include the discovery by Dr. Kurt Fredriksson, division of
meteorites, of a glass with inclusions of metallic nickel-iron in
the Chainpur chondrite. This discovery, which was studied in
detail with the division’s new electron microprobe, is of funda-
mental importance in determining the origin of chondrules and
of chondritic meteorities in general.

As part of a cooperative study with Woods Hole and Scripps
Oceanographic Institutions, Dr. William G. Melson of the divi-
sion of petrology discovered metabasalts in ocean dredge
samples from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Such rocks may require
modifications of existing theories about the origin of the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge, and about processes of rock formation beneath
the sea floor.

While participating in the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian
Biological Survey of Dominica, entomologist Paul Spangler dis-
covered for the first time the presence on the island of the snail
Planorbina glabrata (Say), the intermediate host of the principal
helminthic disease of man, schistosomiasis.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 3

In a study of yucca moths, Dr. Donald R. Davis has proved
beyond doubt the close relationship between agave and yucca
through the habits of the moths. The two genera of plants have
always been placed in two families, but the evidence concerning
the moths suggests that the two genera of plants should be
associated in one.

In a study of material collected on the mid-Pacific Island of
Rapa, Dr. J. F. Gates Clarke has found that an ancient connec-
tion between the fauna of Rapa with those of Australia, New
Zealand, and South Africa is apparent.

In the area of anthropology Dr. K. V. Flannery’s preliminary
research in the Valley of Oaxaca, southern Mexico, has verified
the presence in many of the caves and rockshelters of abundant
perishable remains of human occupation, and has determined
that the corn cobs, cactus fruits, fragments of squash, etc., and
associated artifacts came from the period 6500-2500 B.C.
During this time the development of domesticated plants and
of techniques for growing them provided the basis of the all
important change to settled village life, rapid population growth,
and increasingly complex socioeconomic and religious systems.
Thus Oaxaca joins a few other localities in Mexico in developing
the prerequisities of civilization as we presently are inclined to
describe it.

Dr. W. H. Crocker continued his field work among the Canela
Indians of Brazil. He found that under the pressure of expand-
ing non-Indian settlement and the destruction of their simple
way of life, they were experiencing a messianic movement, led
by a prophetess whom he was able to study at first hand. Rarely
has a social scientist been able to observe at close quarters the
social, psychological, and ecological revolution that a people
undergoes with the impact of shattering external contacts—a
microcosm of much of the upheaval today throughout the
world’s developing nations.

For more than 19 years the Smithsonian has administered the
Panama Canal Zone Biological area, whose scientists are engaged
primarily in behavioral and ecological studies. Four Smith-
sonian staff members are currently employed. Dr. Martin
Moynihan is investigating the evolution of behavior in New
World primates and passerines, particularly the evolution of
4 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

social signal systems. Dr. Robert Dressler is continuing his
work on the pollination relationships among the New World
orchids. Dr. Neal Smith is studying the evolution and genetics
of egg-mimicry in parasitic cuckoos, and has initiated a study of
avian species diversity in tropical grasslands. The newest
member of the staff, Dr. Stanley Rand, is continuing his studies
on the ecology of iguanid lizards and has begun investigating
the role of vocalizations in the social organization of certain
neotropical frogs.

The Institution’s Radiation Biology Laboratory investigates
the direct effects upon, or the indirect control of the functions of,
living organisms by radiation. One of the significant achieve-
ments has been the development of instrumentation to measure
the spectral quality of sunlight, in 100-millimicron bands, from
sunrise to sunset throughout the year. The data that are being
accumulated by means of this instrumentation have been cited
as urgently needed by biologists who deal with light as an
environmental factor. Advances have been made in other areas
of the research program, such as additional information toward
determining the chemical structure of polyphosphate com-
pounds in marine organisms and algae, the light-stimulated
metabolism of sugars in plant development, and improved
techniques for removing radioactive radon from carbon-dating
samples so that samples may be counted without the 30-day
delay previously necessary.

During the past year’s work at the Smithsonian’s Astrophysical
Observatory satellite-tracking data from the Baker-Nunn
cameras at the 12 astrophysical observing stations were used to
make more accurate determinations of the gravitational poten-
tial of the earth, and of the station positions. Analyses of
atmospheric drag on satellites and the atmospheric variations
deduced from it have been completed for half a solar cycle from
the maximum of solar activity during the International Geo-
physical Year through the minimum during the International
Year of the Quiet Sun. Baker-Nunn photographs of comets
are being reduced in studies of tail motions and brightness as a
function of solar activity. ‘The camera network also continues to
observe flare stars. The Prairie Network of automatic cameras
for simultaneous photography of very bright meteors went into
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 5

full operation this year and has already collected significant
data. The Harvard-Smithsonian Meteor Radar Network has
been improved to achieve greater sensitivity and accuracy.
Observations of artificial meteors launched from Wallops
Island have been made, and the data are being reduced. New
measurements of radioactive and stable isotopes in meteorites
and in dust samples from the Greenland Ice-Cap and elsewhere
have been carried out. In theoretical astrophysics, studies of
stellar atmospheres and of very massive and very dense systems
continue. Of the observatory’s flight experiments, the proto-
type of Project Celescope is undergoing environmental testing
while flight hardware is being constructed, a spark-chamber for
detection of gamma rays during balloon flights has been fabri-
cated and is now being tested and calibrated.

In American studies, a wide variety of techniques were
employed in field, laboratory, and library to advance the research
program of the Museum of History and Technology. Among the
year’s accomplishments have been the perfection of underwater
surveying and measuring methods by Mendel L. Peterson in
exploring a late 16th-century shipwreck off Bermuda; the use
of tape recorder and camera by Mr. and Mrs. C. Malcolm
Watkins in recording the survival of folk potterymaking in
Moore County, North Carolina; and the completion of a 700-
page manuscript, The Origins of Chemistry, based upon studies of
archival and printed sources, by Dr. Robert P. Multhauf. In
addition, John C. Ewers has prepared a book, Arizsts of the Old
West, profusely illustrated with reproductions in black-and-white
and color of historically significant drawings and paintings
from museum collections of the United States, Canada, and
Europe.

A hallmark of the Smithsonian’s research enterprise is that it
draws upon a highly diverse community of scholars whose con-
certed efforts can transcend narrow disciplinary approaches to
learning. It undertakes to pursue those courses of investigation
uniquely suited to its institutional character, especially those
which illuminate the ways in which diverse areas of knowledge
are interdependent. An example of this lies in the character
and collections of the Freer Gallery of Art. As always, research
has been the primary activity. Man’s history and culture; the
6 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

organization of life; the nature of the universe: these are time-
less questions. For more than a century they have been the
central concerns of Smithsonian research.

The major joint effort this past year, occupying three Freer
staff members, has been devoted to the final stages of the cata-
logue of Chinese ceremonial bronzes which has been in prepara-
tion for some time. Individual projects range through such
diverse fields as History of Pigments and Coloring Materials,
Biographical Studies of Chinese Painters, Buddhist Wall Paint-
ings in Afghanistan, Yamatoe Painting and Design in Japan,
Dionysiac Elements in Sasanian Art, and Early Distribution
of Chinese and Japanese Porcelain in World Trade. The
traditional close collaboration with the University of Michigan
in the teaching of oriental art has been maintained; and two
curators have taught regularly scheduled courses at the New York
University and Johns Hopkins University. A Freer staff member
has been active on the American committee planning the great
exhibition to be sent to this country by the Japanese Govern-
ment in the coming year and has also supervised the preparation
of the catalogue.

The preceding are all examples of research in which part of
the staff happen to be concerning themselves. Much of this
research depends upon collections of objects which already
belong to the Smithsonian, those 57 million objects so often
referred to, that vast accretion. Some, like the original Wilkes
Exploring Expedition collections arrived fortuitously and were
thrust upon the Institution. Some, like insects from the Island
of Dominica recently collected, have been eagerly sought
after by Smithsonian scientists as evidence of the principles of
evolution. It should never be forgotten that the collections of
the Institution are intended for original investigation. The
Nation has no need of an attic as such, nor should any curator be
charged simply with housekeeping or janitorial tasks.

In our efforts to maintain the levels of excellence to which the
Smithsonian justly lays claim we must demonstrate to the Nation
and to international scholarship our valid and continuing stew-
ardship of these collections through research. The technical
and learned staff of the Smithsonian cannot perform this notable
task alone. This is why this year we have issued the first ‘‘Re-
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 7

search Opportunities” pamphlet, listing some of the many pos-
sibilities in undergraduate and summer programs, in graduate
studies, and in postdoctoral research available to the Nation’s
students and scholars for study here. In this cause we are selfish.
We wish to replicate ourselves, to exhibit to others how many and
how intriguing are the avenues to the increase of knowledge
which lie within our doors. What greater pleasure could we
as scholars afford than to exhibit our collections, our objects as
source material for study? ‘To open avenues to this study
should be our primary objective. To study objects is to return
to the original wellsprings, like the documents and manu-
scripts preserved in a library. The objects are our archives.
From them we can construct concepts about the very nature of
man himself and that “invisible wall which bounds the prison
of our knowledge.”

Without such a positive attitude toward our collections not
only will we never be through curating them but we will never
have properly evoked the knowledge which lies within our
grasp in their constructive study. Anthropologists know this.
The dwindling realms of primitive peoples, people who live on
a different scale and time from ourselves, have yielded up vast
storehouses of ethnography, some of which has revealed truths
about patterns of human life to students from the days of Powell
and Morgan to the more contemporary, Boas, Malinowski, and
Mead. Present-day anthropology is in a quandary about peoples
and social organization. How right were some of the earlier
theorists? Should the theories not be reexamined? One way
to do it, one way to reillumine the scene with vigor and new
intellectual clarity would be to reexamine the objects themselves.
The objects at least still exist, and most of the documents,
journals, and accounts that go with them. Social anthropolo-
gists of the future will be derelict in their duty to the whole
realm of social psychology and cultural evolution if they do not
turn again to the objects, the life formulae, which can speak to
them as surely as to any artist or sculptor.

There is a relation, not tenuous, between the objects and the
thoughts they evoke and the most basic principles of education.
Somewhere in this unrealized, metaphysical half-world there
8 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

may lie a key to the present baffling phenomenon to educators,
the problems of how to interest anyone in anything.

Today, with our national hopes and goals in education, there
is a sense of urgency in this. As part of the President’s war on
poverty and the Youth Opportunity and United Planning Or-
ganization campaigns, the Smithsonian has taken on over 100
youths in various summer programs of training opportunities.
In addition we have undertaken a voluntary Teacher Institute
for 50 social science instructors from a poverty area in order to
train these instructors in how to use the museums as teaching
tools. These are the areas of interest with which the Smith-
sonian should experiment. It may be that the Institution, as
well as museums in general, is especially qualified to develop
interests and technical skills in many young people who do not
respond to more conventional educational techniques.

We hope that this year of the observance of the bicentennial of
James Smithson’s birth will mark a reawakening of under-
standing of the role and the utility of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in many areas little known to our people, in areas of re-
search, of the study of conservation, of knowledge of nature and
the atmosphere, of those dwindling populations of men whose
adjustment to their environment is radically different from our
own, of those dwindling populations of species of animals and
plants the world around that are becoming extinct often because
of relentless pressures unleashed by man himself. Finally, in the
world of creative art and expression the Smithsonian plays a
role in which historical studies become one, with recurring pat-
terns, with those which help to lay bare the mysteries of the
universe, and the life processes which make it up. The Smith-
sonian as it has grown and as it exists lays open a simple present
truth. There are no “‘two cultures.” We are all, scientists and
historians, concerned with a common intellectual process, not
merely with concepts of it, involving a morphology of forms and
in the end a similar testimony to “the increase of knowledge.”

The Board of Regents

The membership of the Board of Regents remained unchanged
except for the new Vice President of the United States, the
Honorable Hubert H. Humphrey, who became an ex officio
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 9

member on January 20, 1965, filling the seat formerly occupied
by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The roll of Regents at the
close of the fiscal year was as follows: Chief Justice of the
United States Earl Warren, Chancellor; members from the
Senate: Clinton P. Anderson, J. William Fulbright, Leverett
Saltonstall; members from the House of Representatives: Frank
T. Bow, Michael J. Kirwan, George H. Mahon; citizen mem-
bers: John Nicholas Brown, William A. M. Burden, Robert V.
Fleming, Crawford H. Greenewalt, Caryl P. Haskins, Jerome C.
Hunsaker.

The customary informal dinner meeting, preceding the annual
meeting, was held on January 27, 1965, in the reception room of
the Museum of History and Technology. Dr. Richard S.
Cowan spoke on ‘““The Smithsonian Institution’s Bredin-Arch-
bold Biological Survey of Dominica”; Mendel L. Peterson on
“New Methods of Surveying Ancient Shipwrecks”; and Dr.
I. E. Wallen on “Oceanography in the Smithsonian.”

The annual meeting was held on January 28, 1965, in the
conference room of the Museum of History and Technology.
The Secretary presented his published annual report on the
activities of the Institution. The chairman of the Executive
and Permanent Committees of the Board, Dr. Robert V.
Fleming, gave the financial report for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1964.

The spring meeting of the Board of Regents was held on
May 19 in the conference room of the Smithsonian building.
An informal dinner followed in the newly decorated Regents’
room.

Finances

A statement of finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian
private funds, will be found in the report of the Executive Com-
mittee of the Board of Regents, page 401.

from the District of Columbia for the National Zoological Park,
$1,738,565; from the National Park Service, Department of the
Interior, for the River Basin Surveys, $237,000.

Lectures

Stella Mary Newton, formerly consultant on historic dress
and adviser to the Restoration Department of the National
Gallery, London, England, delivered an illustrated lecture,
“Social Implications in the Costumes in Hogarth’s Paintings,”
in the auditorium of the Museum of History and Technology on
the afternoon of October 27, 1964.

Vice Admiral Friedrich O. Ruge, GN (Ret.), gave an illus-
trated lecture on ““Rommel and the Invasion of Western Europe
in 1944” in the auditorium of the Museum of Natural History
on the evening of November 23, 1964. This lecture was spon-
sored jointly by the Smithsonian Institution and the Naval
Historical Foundation.

Paul MacKendrick, professor of classics at the University of
Wisconsin, lectured on “‘Athenian Aristocracy: Archaeological
Evidence,” in the auditorium of the Museum of History and
Technology on the evening of February 11, 1965. This illus-
trated lecture was sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the Archaeological Institute of America.

collections, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada, gave an
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 11

illustrated lecture, ‘‘French Canadiana Versus the American
Dream,” in the auditorium of the Museum of History and
Technology on the evening of February 16, 1965.

The second Edwin A. Link Lecture, ‘“The United States and
the Oceans,” was delivered by Lt. Cmdr. Don Walsh, U.S.N.,
in the auditorium of the Museum of Natural History on the eve-
ning of February 17,1965. This series of lectures, made possible
by a grant from the Link Foundation, is administered by the
Smithsonian Institution in cooperation with the U.S. Office of
Education.

Dr. A. G. W. Cameron, senior scientist, Goddard Institute
for Space Studies, Columbia University, gave the 30th Annual
James Arthur Lecture on the Sun on the evening of March 10,
1965, in the auditorium of the Freer Gallery of Art. His subject
was ““The Early History of the Sun.”

Several lectures sponsored by the Freer Gallery of Art and the
National Gallery of Art are listed in the reports of these bureaus.

Visitors

Visitors to the six buildings comprising the Smithsonian com-
plex on the Mall this year again surpassed all preceding records
with a total of 13,153,713, which was 2,340,518 more than in
fiscal 1964. August 1964, with 2,517,672, was the month of
largest attendance, and July 1964 was second with 2,250,105.
The greatest number of visitors for a single day was 109,839 on
April 19, 1965. The tabulation on page 12 gives a summary of
attendance records for the six buildings. The National
Zoological Park had an estimated 4,536,256 visitors during the
year. This figure, added to the attendance in the Institution’s
buildings on the Mall, and to the 1,253,102 recorded at the
National Gallery of Art, brings the total Smithsonian attendance
for fiscal 1965 to 18,943,071.

New Offices

Mindful of the widening horizons and varied opportunities
facing the Institution, the Smithsonian established three new
offices in the past year:

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 13

SMITHSONIAN OFFICE OF ANTHROPOLOGY.—On February 1,
1965, the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Department
of Anthropology of the Museum of Natural History were com-
bined to form the new Smithsonian Office of Anthropology
under the Museum of Natural History. This consolidation
unites the efforts and resources of the Institution in modern
programs in ethnology, linquistics, archeology, and physical
anthropology. Dr. Richard B. Woodbury was appointed its
acting head. Activities of the new office as well as the bureau’s
accomplishments in the past year are given on pages 39-53 of
this report.

Division OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING.—Recognition of the
Smithsonian’s responsibilities and opportunities in research and
higher education led to the establishment in October 1964 of
the Division of Education and Training. Effective July 1, 1965,
Dr. Charles Blitzer was appointed its director. The objective
of this new division is to bring about the fullest use of the Insti-
tution’s resources—both its collections and its distinguished staff
of scientists and scholars—and to make these resources available
to the scientific and scholarly community at large. This objec-
tive is being pursued through a variety of programs.

Under one of these programs the Smithsonian entered into
agreements with a number of universities for cooperation in
postgraduate education. Typically, such agreements contem-
plate use of the Smithsonian collections by Ph. D. candidates
with the supervision of Smithsonian staff members; often, closer
ties are developed between Smithsonian scholars and the
universities’ graduate departments. During the year under
review, cooperative programs were established with the Uni-
versity of Kansas for graduate training in botany and pale-
ontology, with the University of Pennsylvania for graduate
training in the history and philosophy of science, and with the
George Washington University for graduate training in
American Studies, in museum techniques, and in sedimentology.
At the end of the year negotiations were in progress for similar
cooperative programs in anthropology, botany, field biology,
the fine arts, the history of art, and marine science.

The results of these programs—already measurable in those
that have been operating for some time—will be the develop-
14 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

ment of highly trained specialists in areas of the sciences, the
humanities, and the arts in which the Smithsonian traditionally
has been involved, as well as the enhancement of research
activities by the Institution’s permanent staff as it is brought
into closer contact with colleagues in the academic world.

The Division of Education and Training also conducted two
programs through which undergraduates and beginning grad-
uate students are brought to the Smithsonian during the summer
as junior research associates. Of the 53 students appointed
under this program, 16 were supported by a grant to the Smith-
sonian from the National Science Foundation’s Undergraduate
Research Participation Program. Appointments were based
on academic achievement and potential for research, and con-
siderable care was taken to ensure that each student’s experi-
ence would contribute significantly to his education.

With a view toward extending the Smithsonian’s services to
the local research community, the Division of Education and
Training conducted a survey of the educational activities of
Federal research centers, private research centers, and uni-
versities in and around the District of Columbia. Results of
this study were made available to those concerned with the
development of the area’s potential for higher education.

The division also arranged for the holding of a special summer
institute for 50 social science teachers from the public schools
of the District of Columbia. The purpose of the institute was
to develop with the teachers ways of using the museums on the
Mall as major educational resources for their classes.

Throughout its history the Smithsonian has welcomed scien-
tists and scholars from colleges, universities, and other research
institutions in this country and abroad. Their use of the Smith-
sonian’s collections, and their association with its professional
staff, clearly contribute to the purposes for which the Institution
exists. Their presence testifies to the importance of the Smith-
sonian’s resources for research and, at the same time, serves to
enliven the scholarly atmosphere of the Institution.

To encourage the use of the Smithsonian’s resources by out-
side investigators, and to ensure that their visits will prove as
fruitful as possible both from the point of view of advancing
human knowledge and from the point of view of the special
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 15

concerns of the Smithsonian, the Division of Education and
Training is developing a number of programs for visiting re-
search associates. Funds, both public and private, are being
. sought for these programs.

OFFICE OF SPECIAL PRoyects.—The Office of Special Projects
was established this year with Robert N. Cunningham in charge.

The primary concern of the office thus far has been the detailed
and thorough preparation for the formal commemoration of the
birth of the Institution’s founder, James Smithson. The year
1965 marks the 200th anniversary of his birth, and Congress
designated September 17 and 18 as special days to honor Smith-
son’s memory. In addition to honoring the _ Institution’s
founder, the stated aims of the Bicentennial Celebration are:

1. To pay tribute to the distinguished past of the Smith-
sonian and affirm to its members and Regents, to scholars,
scientists, and kindred institutions, and to the general public,
the Smithsonian’s intent to fulfill a vital and useful role in
society ; and

2. To examine the nature of knowledge and creative dis-
covery as conceived by Smithson and as understood today.

The Office of Special Projects has also been laying the ground-
work for the establishment of a Smithsonian Society of Associates,
an organization seen as a national association with several types
of membership, which would seek to diffuse knowledge of the
Institution as widely as possible in order to enlarge understand-
ing and support of its activities—thereby increasing the scope
and depth of the Smithsonian’s scientific, cultural, and educa-
tional contributions to mankind.

FRANK A. TayLor, Director

The annual reporting procedures of the U.S. National Museum have
been changed to take cognizance of the broadening scholarly horizons
of the Smithsonian Institution and of the enlarged scope of the Museum
of History and Technology resulting from the move to its new building.

In order that its message reach a wider audience, the full report of
the U.S. National Museum, rather than the condensed version pre-
viously given, will be carried in Smithsonian Year. Within the Museum
Report, henceforth, the work of the component Museums of Natural
History and of History and Technology will be treated separately.
Furthermore, the contents of each report are rearranged to emphasize
the fact that research and publication are the foundations from which
arise the other activities and services of the Museum. To this end,
also, a bibliography of staff publications is appended to the research
report of each office and department. A full list of the publications
issued by the Museum appears in the report on publications, on pages
392-395,

Those activities heretofore found under the Bureau of American
Ethnology in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution are
reported by the Museum on pages 39-53, under the Smithsonian Office
of Anthropology, into which office the Bureau has been merged.

The consolidated Annual Report formerly issued by the U.S. National
Museum is discontinued. Instead, separates of the reports of its com-
ponent Museums appearing in Smithsonian Year will be available for
those accustomed to receive the consolidated Annual Report. To each
separate report will be appended a full list of the donors to that
Museum.

Conservation

To serve the various museums of the Smithsonian Institution, a con-
servation research laboratory has been established under the United
States National Museum. Directed by Charles H. Olin, its offices are
located in the Museum of History and Technology.

The conservation research laboratory began the installation of
equipment for physical and chemical analysis. This includes in-

19
20 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

strumentation for x-ray spectrography and x-ray diffraction, equipment
for preparing, examining, and photographing cross-sections of metals,
an infrared spectrophotometer, and accessory equipment.

In the area of x-ray spectrography, qualitative spectra were used to
identify the composition of metal alloys in objects from the Freer
Gallery and from the divisions of archeology, numismatics, mechanical
and civil engineering, medical sciences, and physical sciences of the
Museum of History and Technology. Approximately one-fourth of
the time devoted to x-ray analyses involved the establishment of
sampling methods and standards. In quantitative analysis, an in-
vestigation was begun into the method of sampling whereby drillings
of the sample are pressed into a pellet. X-ray diffraction was used
for the identification of corrosion products and pigments for the
National Collection of Fine Arts and for the divisions of cultural
history and archeology.

Of 134 requests for analyses and conservation received, the laboratory
completed 52 analyses and furnished the services required in 54 of
the conservation requests. Advice was furnished on requirements
for collection preservation involving air conditioning and the control
of light and dust. Conservation treatment was performed on objects
of bronze, glass, hide, ceramics, and wood; and also on paintings,
prints, feathers, photographs, and archival materials, even though the
facilities of the laboratory are designed for analysis and conservation
research and not for treatment.

The problem of providing an abstracting service for the fields of
conservation and archeological chemistry was studied for the laboratory
by Dr. Seymour Lewin, Conservation Center, New York University.
His report, which evaluated the problem and outlined a program, is now
being used to secure support for a proposed abstract journal. Professor
Cyril Smith, who visited the laboratory for one week, prepared reports
on the organization of the laboratory and on the metallographic
examination of objects from Ecuador.

T. DALE STEWART, Director

The trend toward specialization in science hasreached the point where
few museum curators can be considered broad naturalists in the sense of
some of their predecessors. Botanists more than ever concentrate on a
portion of one plant family and disclaim anything but a general knowl-
edge of other families. Vertebrate paleontologists work with larger
assemblages, such as groups of reptiles, fishes, or mammals, but often
in a single geographical area or geological epoch. Anthropologists
study man from the standpoint either of some part of his physique or
of his culture, and the latter only in its historic or its prehistoric aspect.
And much the same holds for other specialties. For this reason, and
also because more money is available for research than ever before,
research projects in which many people from a number of disciplines
participate have become customary.

The Museum of Natural History finds itself involved in some large-
scale projects of this sort. Mention has been made in previous reports,
for example, of the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian Biological Survey of
Dominica. Since January 1964 when it was initiated, 24 specialists
representing 10 disciplines have spent varying periods of time on this
Caribbean island. The Smithsonian African Mammal Project has had
altogether about 15 collectors in the field since 1961, giving attention
not only to the mammals but to their ectoparasites. Also, the
International Indian Ocean Expedition has included in its numerous
cruises 11 specialists from the Museum representing 6 different fields,
with a large back-up group in the Museum’s Sorting Center hastening
the preparation of the resulting collections.

But the project which surpasses all others in number of personnel and
size of the geographical area covered is the Pacific Ocean Biological
Survey Program, described in the following section by its principal
investigator.

23
24 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

An Ecological Survey of the Central Pacific

The Smithsonian Institution is engaged in an ecological survey
of a central Pacific area comprising some four and a third million
square miles of open ocean, dotted here and there with clusters and
strings of islands and atolls. The major goals of this survey are to
learn what plants and animals occur on the islands in this vast region
and the seasonal variations in their numbers and reproductive activities,
and in addition to learn more about the factors which determine the
distribution and abundance of the birds of the open ocean in that
environment.

The survey is designed to accumulate in a few years sufficient data
on the plants and animals, on the pelagic birds at sea, and on climatic
and oceanographic variables, to permit broad ecological conclusions
to be drawn.

To initiate the survey, the Smithsonian sent several small field parties
to the Hawaiian Leeward and Phoenix Islands. As the survey grew
in scope, other institutions and government agencies joined the effort,
and today the Smithsonian alone has a combined field and laboratory
staff of about 40 intensively studying the plants and animals of 33
islands. .

The main area of interest (see map), which represents only a small
fraction of the total Pacific Ocean, was more or less arbitrarily delimited
to include a wide variety of island groups and oceanic conditions. It
spans the Equator, extending from latitudes 30° N. to 10° S., and it
includes islands and island groups from longitudes 150° to 180° W.
Most of the islands are products of coral construction on worn-off
volcanic upheavals—the tops of the submarine mountain ranges which
spring up from the ocean floor 15,000 to 18,000 feet below. The
Hawaiian Islands stretch for 1,578 miles across the northern end of the
study area. Johnston Atoll, an isolated surface indication of the vast
mid-Pacific mountain range, lies 450 miles south of the Hawaiian ridge.
Farther south and to the east, the Line Islands stretch in a long chain
across the Equator. In the southwestern corner of the study area
Howland and Baker lie just north of the Equator, the Phoenix Islands
are clustered 3° to 5° south of it, and the Tokelaus lie 5° farther south.

Except for the main Hawaiian Islands and certain of the Line and
Phoenix Islands, this whole area is characterized by low rainfall. The
majority of the low-lying coral islands have desert climates. Their
sparse vegetation consists of a few grasses, herbs, and dwarf shrubs.

A few species of terrestrial mammals and reptiles, some of them
introduced by man, occur on several of the islands, but across this vast
central-Pacific area, oceanic birds are the dominant terrestrial verte-

brates. Apart from the endemic and introduced birds on the
main Hawaiians and certain of the Hawaiian Leeward and Line
Islands, about 90 species occur as migrants, accidentals, or nesting
birds. On islands of the area, 28 species of oceanic birds are known to
nest, and an additional 21 species occur as regular migrants or
accidentals.

The ecology of oceanic birds is a curious hybrid between the ter-
restrial ecology of islands and the ecology of the sea (more often called
oceanography), in that the surrounding ocean provides food for the
island avifauna and affects the climate of the island as well. The
ecology of the oceanic birds under study, moreover, is affected not only
by conditions on and around the islands, but by conditions in regions
remote from the central Pacific.

Present conditions on these islands reflect the introduction of many
species of plants and animals over the years by man, who has also made
major changes in the distribution and abundance of soils and other
surface materials by his guano mining during the latter part of the
19th century. Hence, to understand the disturbed conditions on many
of the islands, it has been necessary to delve deeply into the history of
man’s activities in the central Pacific.

Fortunately, the extensive file of published and unpublished reports,
diaries, and other records pertaining to the area, organized by Edwin
H. Bryan, Jr., manager of the Pacific Scientific Information Center at
the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, and the extensive files of Dr. F. Ray-
mond Fosberg of the U.S. Geological Survey have been placed at
the service of the Smithsonian. From these and other sources can be
learned the extent to which man has disturbed the ecology of some of
these Pacific islands. For example, over a period of about two decades
during the latter part of the 19th century, approximately 125,000 tons
of guano were removed from Howland, a remote desert island only
eight-tenths of a square mile in area. In the 1930’s this island was
colonized, and three airplane runways, each 150 feet wide, were built,
preempting 7 percent of its total area. And in the early years of
World War II it was shelled or bombed at various times.

On islands of the nearby Phoenix group from which the human popu-
lations have been moved out, a legacy remains of introduced plants
and mammals, of which the domestic cat is surely the most destructive
influence. Phoenix and McKean Islands are free of cats and support
16 species of nesting birds including petrels, shearwaters, boobies,
frigatebirds, tropicbirds, and terns. Howland and Baker Islands both
had cat populations. At that time Howland supported only 5 nesting
species of birds, numbering fewer than 3,000 individuals, and Baker
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY—INTRODUCTION 27

but one nesting species, the noddy tern, with a population of fewer
than 100.

One year later all cats on Howland and Baker were finally extermi-
nated. Almost immediately the number of species present and nesting
increased. Coincidentally, on Baker Island the house mouse became
superabundant, with its population estimated to number in the hun-
dreds of thousands, where in the previous year it had been extremely
rare. Thus, even though man’s actions have drastically modified many
of the islands, changing the vegetation and in some cases exterminating
some of the animals, the sea-bird populations are able to recover swiftly
when predators are eliminated through effective conservation.

Although the ecology of plants and animals of all kinds is the concern
of the Smithsonian survey, most of the field effort has been devoted to
the birds and arthropods, which are the most abundant terrestrial
organisms in the central Pacific. In the two and one-half years that the
survey has been under way, enormous quantities of data have been
collected and are being organized, but as yet any attempt at synthesis
would be premature. New data and new ideas are appearing at such
a rapid rate that it will be some time before a first level of organization
and synthesis is completed and ecological conclusions can be drawn.

An example of the survey’s data-collecting efforts is the study of
bird distribution in the central Pacific by means of banding. This
banding program is designed to provide answers to such questions as:
What contribution do the bird populations of each island make to the
avifauna of the open sea? What is the pattern of dispersal of birds from
any given island—where do they go after the nesting season? It is also
designed to provide new facts concerning the biology and behavior of
the population of birds on any given island, and on the origins of the
migratory birds which pass through or winter in the area. To provide
this information enormous numbers of birds must be banded. Up to
April 1965, Smithsonian field parties had attached U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service bands to the legs of over 425,000 birds of 44 species.
Although most of these birds were banded on islands in the area of
interest, programs were also undertaken in the Marshalls and Gilberts,
on Wake Island, and on St. George Island in the Pribilofs.

For most of the resident species in the area of interest, it is the hope
to band over 50 percent of entire populations. For species such as the
sooty tern, the populations of which number in the millions, this is
clearly impossible, but for species with populations numbering in the
tens of thousands, the Smithsonian has been able to band over half the
entire breeding population. The blue-faced booby illustrates this
point: over 25,000 individuals have been banded in the study area, and
28 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

of this number more than 500 have been recaptured at sea or at other
islands. ‘The data from interisland returns of banded birds now make
it possible to state in quantitative terms the differences between age
groups and nesting and nonnesting birds in their amount of wandering
at different times of the year. As additional data of these kinds ac-
cumulate, it will be possible to determine the amount of interisland
mixing, the composition of roosting flocks, age at first nesting, longev-
ity, mortality curves, and so on.

The effectiveness of the Smithsonian banding program in the central
Pacific has been largely due to the enthusiastic cooperation of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service Bird Banding Laboratory. Without this
organization and its system of maintaining and processing data, the
program could never have gotten underway.

In order to increase the rate of recovery of banded birds throughout
the Pacific world, the Smithsonian has sent out thousands of copies of
a notice soliciting reports of banded or color-marked birds. Printed
in five languages, these have been distributed to 19 countries and 21
major island groups, where the notice has been further translated
into Korean, Malay, Samoan, Gilbertese, Ponapean, and other
languages, and has been reprinted in newspapers, magazines, and vari-
ous commercial and official or semiofficial government reports. The
notice has formed the basis for lectures to school children, clubs, and
professional groups, and it has been distributed to vessels in various
commercial fishing fleets and shipping lines, and to the U.S. Navy,
Merchant Marine, and Coast Guard. The Smithsonian also issues a
newsletter which is sent to all cooperators in the Pacific-wide bird
banding program. This publicity effort, in addition to increasing the
recovery of banded birds, heightens public interest in problems of
conservation in the Pacific area.

Although most of the field work in the central Pacific is being under-
taken by a Smithsonian field staff under director Charles A. Ely,
whose offices are in Honolulu, the success of the program depends
most heavily on the generous cooperation of numerous collaborating
institutions and individuals.

An agreement between the Institution and the U.S. Department of
the Interior has resulted in a free exchange of information and services,
particularly with respect to the Hawaiian Leeward Islands, where
mutual interest and exchange of information further enhances the
status of these islands as wildlife refuges or sanctuaries. The Smith-
sonian has received enthusiastic cooperation from the State of Hawaii
Division of Fish and Game, which represents the interest of the State in
ecology, management, and conservation.

The effectiveness of Smithsonian studies of the distribution of
pelagic birds at sea is almost entirely dependent upon the Department
of the Interior, Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, in Honolulu. This
agency has generously provided not only ship support for bird censuses,
but also a body of oceanographic data which, when combined with the
ornithological data, will make a unique contribution to our understand-
ing of the oceanographic factors affecting their distribution.

Modern transportation and communication facilities are essential
for the coordination of a large-scale biological survey over such a
vast region. The Smithsonian maintains permanent field parties on
two islands through the courtesy of the U.S. Coast Guard, which also,
from time to time, very kindly grants opportunities for Smithsonian
personnel to visit various islands during the course of regular Coast
Guard trips. In addition, the U.S. Navy has generously permitted
Smithsonian personnel to carry out at-sea observations on its vessels.
Never before has it been feasible to visit most of the islands in this
area three or four times a year, or to carry out monthly at-sea surveys
over a period of years to collect data on pelagic bird distribution and
on various physical oceanographic factors.
30 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

Studies of the distribution and ecology of terrestrial plants on islands
of the central Pacific, in which Dr. Charles Lamoureaux and Mr.
Robert Long, of the University of Hawaii, are collaborating with the
Smithsonian Institution, are important not only in developing an
inventory of plants on each of the islands and a history of plant intro-
ductions, but also to an understanding of the factors affecting the
distribution and abundance of terrestrial animals.

Perhaps the most important practical accomplishment of the Smith-
sonian survey will be the delineation of the environment over a relatively
short period of time. This will provide a baseline of comparison
for biologists concerned, 10 or 20 years from now, with measuring the
effects of man-made modifications of the environment on natural
populations of organisms. The need for such a baseline is most
urgent today, when man, in his struggle to advance himself, is changing
the face of the earth at an appallingly rapid rate, and is subjecting
the total environment—water, atmosphere, and living tissues—to
physical and chemical influences which need to be measureeg gw and
in the future. For unless these fundamental changes in his environ-
ment are properly assessed, man himself, through ignorance, may fall
victim to his own progress.

SYSTEMATICS

The Office of Systematics was established early in 1965 to provide a
focal point for systematic interests both within the Museum of Natural
History and outside it. Although nearly all the professional staff
engage in systematic research, interdisciplinary needs increasingly
occur which can be met best by a non-discipline-oriented office.
Typical of these needs are research problems requiring joint attack
by several disciplines.

In long-range terms, the most important project which transects
all disciplinary lines involves data processing by computer. As the
number of specimens in natural history collections increases, a stage is
reached at which the specimen-attached. data become difficult or
impossible to organize and recover by “manual” methods. A central
file of such data from our own millions of specimens, and ultimately
including those of other museums, will provide the means by which
many permutations of these data can be performed almost instantly.
Moreover, bibliographic, karyologic, genetic, ecologic, and biochemi-
cal data can be inserted in sucha data bank and retrieved in various
new combinations with other data. Such a facility will provide the
researcher with a means by which an almost limitless number of data
configurations can be programed to meet his needs.

Such vast files of information require any available device which
facilitates their organization into retrievable form; the binomial borne
by each species of plant or animal is the means by which the most
diverse sort of information can be organized, stored, and retrieved.
But 30 million names are difficult and prohibitively expensive to use
directly in an information system. Under way is the development of
a code to express names in machine-readable form, free of hierarchical
implications and completely open-ended. Support from several sources
is being sought to complete the code and begin the accumulation of data.

The International Biological Program will begin field operations
in January 1967, and those studying the biota of Africa will have in
hand a field guide to the mammals. This is the objective of a project
receiving Institutional support through the Office of Systematics. One
of the foremost mammalogists in southern Africa is writing various
parts of the manual, and he is securing the contributions of mammal
specialists over the world.

The National Institutes of Health have provided contractual support
for a project to search among our collections for tumors of invertebrates

31

and cold-blooded vertebrates. ‘There is reasonable hope that the
phylogeny of some of the animal groups, as well as that of tumer
diseases, may be elucidated by this project.

An ad hoc committee consisting of representatives from archeology,
paleobotany, and modern plant systematics has participated in present-
ing the need for a pollen laboratory and staff. Pollen grains are highly
resistant to destruction and are so distinctive as to permit the specialist
to reconstruct reasonably accurately the former vegetation of an area
and the environmental conditions under which the plants grew.
Likewise, the pollens of primitive man’s crop plants persist in the refuse
of his habitations and reveal much about the kinds of things he grew
and under what conditions. The student of recent plants uses paly-
nological data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of plant groups
and to clarify phylogenetic relationships. Funds have been set aside
for the equipping of the laboratory, and it is hoped that a research
palynologist can be employed by the end of the next fiscal year.

A new publication, “Smithsonia,”’ planned for next year, is dis-
tinctive in that it is a series of which each unit is devoted to the descrip-
tion of a new species or redescription of an old one. Such a format
will permit progressive revision of genera and other taxa by the pub-
lication of groups of descriptions. |

Initial planning has begun toward convening at the Smithsonian in
1966 an international symposium on systematics, jointly sponsored
by the National Science Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences,
and the Smithsonian Institution. Outstanding systematists from
abroad will participate with prominent American ones in a one-day
session on principles of systematics and a second day on methodologies.
It is hoped that future conferences can be held on important questions
related to the training of both technical researchers and scientific aides
for systematics. Such meetings satisfy an important responsibility of
the Office—to represent systematics at all levels, to urge the incorpora-
tion of taxonomic data in otherwise non-systematic studies, and to
broaden the base of current systematics to include information from as
many ancillary sources as possible.

ECOLOGY

Man has learned, to a very large extent, how to escape, through
control of his environment, the pangs of hunger, the rigors of un-
favorable weather, and the anxieties of individual preservation, as op-
posed to group protection. In the process, however, man has so
greatly modified his surroundings that the human species, as its popula-
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-ECOLOGY 33

tions expand apace, stands in very real danger of losing control over
its own destiny. To focus research effort, while there is yet time, on
important problems of environmental biology, plans were completed
for establishing, on July 1, 1965, an Office of Ecology. Selected as
its head, and assistant director for ecology, is Helmut Buechner, who
will continue his own researches in the behavior of certain ungulate
mammals.

Since the systematic research produced by the professional staff has
generally included ecological data, the program represents not a
beginning of Institutional interest but a means to focus staff attention
on the subject and to facilitate cooperation between the Smithsonian
and other Federal agencies and educational organizations.

In January an informal conference of outstanding biologists discussed
research trends and opportunities in environmental biology, including
ecology, genetics, behavior, and the study of wild populations under
natural conditions. Participants were requested specifically to con-
sider (1) what contributions might be made by environmental studies
in the New World Tropics, (2) the desirability of undertaking studies of
soil ecology, and (3) the projected field stations on Chesapeake Bay.

Several planning sessions were devoted to organizing the Center for
Field Biology, on land at the head of Chesapeake Bay, in summer of
1965. As its first director, Kyle Barbehenn will be in charge of the
Center and its program development. Sharing the Center with
Smithsonian research personnel will be biologists from the Johns
Hopkins University, the University of Maryland, and, to a limited
extent, from the National Institutes of Health, who will study captive
animals, as well as native and migrating ones, and their possible inter-
action with the environment.

Consideration has been given to undertaking a research program
on soil biology in which will be investigated the nature of the inter-
actions of soil organisms on each other and with their environment.
Although applied studies of soil organisms are under way in various
research laboratories, little or no attention has been devoted to the
ecological aspects of this problem.

Since the International Biological Program is strongly oriented toward
environmental biology, the Office of Ecology will also be a focal point
for staff participation in this program.

OCEANOGRAPHY

Although the Smithsonian Institution has been engaged in studies of
marine organisms since Spencer F. Baird joined its staff more than
34 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

100 years ago, the active involvement of the Institution in a National
Oceanography Program has made it necessary for the Institution to
reexamine its interests and capabilities for studying the world ocean.

This reexamination has rested comfortably within the context of the
traditional operations of the Museum of Natural History; that is to say,
the Smithsonian’s marine operations are principally concerned with
collecting marine natural-history objects in order to determine the
kinds, distributions, and populations of organisms and sediments in
the world ocean. These studies are oriented toward systematics; the
available data are exploited, however, for additional information
concerning the ecology, biogeography, and evolution of the specimens
collected. Because proper study of these specimens is not feasible
without an active program to gather material from areas not repre-
sented in the national collections, Smithsonian scientists continue to
seek collections from chartered vessels and from ships of many public
and private agencies.

In addition to these research responsibilities, the Smithsonian has
always provided limited service to other governmental and non-
governmental scientists by making identifications of natural-history
objects. As a part of its expansion in the National Oceanography
Program, the Institution has now developed an increased capability
for the accomplishment of such service by establishing the Smithsonian
Oceanographic Sorting Center for the separation of bulk collections
into groups which may be studied effectively by individual scientists.

The magnitude of effort required for this involvement in the National
Oceanography Program is evidenced by the nearly 80 U.S. oceano-
eraphic vessels of assorted sizes that are gathering marine specimens,
many of which may end up at the Smithsonian Institution: 10 private
U.S. oceanographic institutions use 22 ships for oceanographic col-
lection of data and specimens; 22 Coast Guard vessels collect data and
specimens on ocean stations; and many large and small vessels of the
Navy, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Bureau of Commercial
Fisheries, and other government agencies obtain data and collections
from the ocean. Impetus recently has been given to a so-called
‘ships of opportunity” effort which could use for biological collections
many of the estimated 6,000 civilian and military ships which may be
at sea on any one day in the North Atlantic alone. The backlog of
biological research information waiting to be uncovered is scarcely
realized, even within the Museum.

The oceanography plans of the Institution have been developed in
continuous consultation with scientists of the United States in all
fields of biological oceanography. Hence, a large portion of this
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-OCEANOGRAPHY 35

program involves cooperation with many other agencies. Since
1962 the Institution has maintained membership in the Interagency
Committee on Oceanography (ICO), and the assistant director for
oceanography of the Museum of Natural History is chairman of its
research panel. In addition to support from Congress, joint research
projects, with funds from both organizations, have been undertaken by
the Smithsonian and each of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Office
of Naval Research, the Department of State, the Bureau of Commercial
Fisheries, the National Science Foundation, the Naval Oceanographic
Office, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
Interagency Committee on Oceanography, and one state agency—the
Maryland Fisheries Commission. Also, joint research projects have
been undertaken by staff members of the Institution with support from
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Lamont Geological
Observatory, the Marine Biological Laboratory of Woods Hole, the
University of Maryland, Duke University, the University of Kansas,
Johns Hopkins University, the University of Michigan, the University
of Minnesota, the University of Miami, the University of Southern
California, Yale University, Florida State University, the University
of Washington, and others.

Regional industrial and professional groups, foundations, and in-
dividuals also have provided support and specimens to the Institution’s
oceanography program. These include International Business Ma-
chines, Inc., the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the Link
Foundation, the National Geographic Society, the American Chemical
Society, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Hong Kong Fisheries
Research Station, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission,
the Guinean Trawling Survey, the Indian Ocean Biological Center,
the National Oceanographic Data Center, General Ed Schwengel,
Jeanne Schwengel, and Edwin A. Link.

Specimens have been identified for the Naval Oceanographic Office,
the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Coastal Engineering Research
Center, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the Bureau of
Commercial Fisheries, the National Science Foundation’s Antarctic
Research Program, and a large number of other Federal and private
organizations.

Field support has been provided to members of the oceanography
staff by ships of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the
National Science Foundation, Stanford University, the University of
Southern California, the Marine Biological Laboratory of Woods
Hole, Mass., the University of Miami, and the National Aeronautics
36 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

and Space Administration. Vessels also have been chartered specifi-
cally for use by the Institution.

Projects that have been supported by other agencies have been in the
areas of marine systematics and ecology, the processing of specimens,
the keeping of records of natural-history specimens, and the publication
of appropriate documents, as well as the establishment of an oceano-
graphic exhibit in the Museum of Natural History.

In doing research on the biological and geological natural history
of the oceans, members of the staff of the Smithsonian Institution have
functioned to study existing collections of the Museum of Natural
History and other museums; to take additional collections in unique
areas; to describe organisms in relation to their environment; to report
unusual natural history features, such as the presence of cancer and
other abnormalities, in order that biological and physiological studies
might be pursued elsewhere; to formulate theories with regard to the
evolution of organisms; to provide explanations of the intra- and inter-
relationships of organisms; to develop field guides for the easy identifica-
tion of marine specimens; to develop and test basic collecting gear for
use in studying marine organisms; to provide an urgently needed
identification service; to assemble, maintain, and provide access to the
national collections; to provide a collecting staff for use in unique
areas; to develop curating and preservation techniques, and other
handling advice and experience; and to provide for proper storage of
collections in appropriate facilities.

A natural outgrowth of the National Oceanography Program has
been an ever-broadening involvement of the Institution in collections
from the routine operations as a part of the world ocean survey, from
research cruises and expeditions of other agencies, and from special
international programs such as the International Indian Ocean Expe-
dition and the International Cooperative Investigations of the Tropical
Atlantic. The Institution has found it desirable to be involved as
closely as possible in the planning of various expeditions and has en-
deavored to produce labels and specimen-handling information on a
continuing basis, so that collections can be maintained in better con-
dition for ultimate study and so that adequate environmental infor-
mation is available to provide broad interpretation of the biological
data resulting from the studies.

Perhaps the most obvious of the changes in the first three years of the
Smithsonian’s research effort in oceanography has been a large increase
in staff involvement in biological and geological oceanography activi
ties. Not only has the number of scientists involved in the oceanog-
raphy program tripled in these three years, but the number of organi-

zational units included in the program also has tripled. Whereas
before, the Institution had extremely restricted capability to treat the
nearly 100 major groups of marine organisms, selective recruiting has
resulted in the addition of capabilities to examine and carry out research
on groups which could not be included in earlier oceanographic efforts.

The expansion of staff within the Museum of Natural History has
been almost entirely in the systematics area. Additional groups of
marine organisms may now be studied, and in this fiscal year, capabili-
ties have been added to carry out research in such marine groups as
ostracodes, amphipods, nematodes, macroalgae, coralline algae, and
plankton. New personnel include a senior electron microscopist, a
sedimentologist, and a petrologist interested in marine rocks.

The principal new activity within the oceanography program is the
Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center, conceived by A. C. Smith,
former Assistant Secretary for Science, and organized in January 1963
to receive bulk samples from governmental and private sources; to
separate them into appropriate taxa for identification by specialists; to
obtain and coordinate the station data to provide maximum environ-
mental information with the specimens; to experiment with preserva-
tion, labeling, accessioning, shipping, and storage of specimens; to
train technicians for all aspects of specimen handling; and to provide
information and forms helpful to oceanographic investigations by
insuring that consideration be given to the maximum collection of
environmental data.

More than five million specimens have been sorted by the Center, and
more than three million of these have been shipped to specialists for
study. In spite of this productivity, the Center has a tremendous back-
log of specimens which have been given it for processing, and a sub-
stantial expansion in its staff is needed to work on the specimens.

The Sorting Center uses a series of seven advisory groups, each con-
sisting of five members with differing research specialties. The advice
of these committees is sought with regard to the assignment for study
of specimens processed by the Center and for recommendations of
permanent depositories of identified specimens. In addition to these
continuing groups, the Center has sought specific advice from John
Wickstead of the British Plymouth Laboratory; from Ruth Patrick of
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences; from Allan Bé of the
Lamont Geological Observatory; from E. C. Jones of the Bureau of
Commercial Fisheries Laboratory in Hawaii; from Saul Saila of the
University of Rhode Island; and from Isabel Farfantes Canet. In
addition, assistance and advice is given by the several hundred sci-
entists visiting the Center. Such guidance is continually sought
through correspondence with the above and other persons.

789-427—66-——7
38 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Of special note is project support for strong involvement of the Sort-
ing Center in the U.S. Antarctic Research Program of the National
Science Foundation (NSF). With NSF support, the Center lists
specimens taken from all past U.S. efforts in the Antarctic, and it sorts
and maintains records of specimens now being taken from the Ant-
arctic. In addition, the photographs of the ocean bottom taken from
the NSF research vessel Eltanin are duplicated and distributed to
scientists.

Also noteworthy are collections made available for study by the Na-
tional Science Foundation through the International Indian Ocean
Expedition, by the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and by the Inter-
governmental Oceanographic Commission’s International Cooperative
Investigations of the Tropical Atlantic. Other collections have come
to the Sorting Center from the Pacific Halibut Commission, the Inter-
American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Guinean Trawling Survey,
the Geological Survey, the Coast Guard, the Naval Oceanographic
Office, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Coastal Engineering Re-
search Center, the Laboratory of Radiation Biology of the University
of Washington, the University of Michigan, the Atomic Energy
Commission, and the Government of Chile.

Through the Sorting Center, technician Jack Rudloe was employed
to make special collections as a professional collector during the Inter-
national Indian Ocean Expedition; T. Peter Lowe worked as a tech-
nician in lieu of a scientist on the Anton Bruun; and Mrs. LaNelle Peter-
son and Mrs. Cynthia Stoertz participated as professional collectors in
a cruise of the Eltanin in the Antarctic in early 1965.

Special labels and other collecting materials and forms were devel-
oped for, and provided to, the International Indian Ocean Expedition,
the International Cooperative Investigations of the Tropical Atlantic,
and the U.S. Antarctic Research Program. Duplication and distribu-
tion of these labels, as well as the provision of a central receiving and
processing facility, have resulted in increasing the effective results of
natural history expeditions by providing for better maintenance of more
collections for study.

The Sorting Center has served as a unifying influence in the system-
atics of marine organisms by providing specimens and information con-
ing the stages of their processing, together with information on the
commitments of specialists scattered throughout the world. Visiting
scientists may find working space in the Center. As a result of the
activities of the Center, an increasing number of the individual speci-
mens from multiple bulk collections are being processed for their re-
search value, and the results may be fitted together more effectively.
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-OCEANOGRAPHY 39

It is anticipated that this flourishing activity will go on from its healthy
beginning to do much to meet the challenge of man’s expansion into
the ocean.

As the most recent new effort of the Smithsonian, an oceanographic
vessel has been acquired from Navy surplus and modified slightly for
use in an investigation of coralline algae of the North Atlantic Ocean.
This vessel, the Phykos, is a converted small freighter, 133’9’’ length,
30’ beam, 650-ton displacement, which will be used principally as a
platform for SCUBA diving and for the operation of a small undersea
vehicle. It is anticipated that a crew of six or seven will be able to
operate the vessel for a scientist to collect these algae from shallow
depths around the margin of the North Atlantic. The Phykos began
operation during this year and will operate throughout the next.

ANTHROPOLOGY

The Smithsonian Office of Anthropology was created on February
1, 1965, to renew and expand the Smithsonian’s role in anthro-
pology. Uniting the separate activities of the Bureau of American
Ethnology and of the Department of Anthropology of the Museum
of Natural History, it includes all the personnel of both former units,
and its head is also an assistant director of the Museum of Natural
History. The Office consists of a division of cultural anthropology and
a division of physical anthropology, and it administers the Smith-
sonian River Basin Surveys. It also includes the archives and library
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, a conservation laboratory, and
a section for illustrations. It maintains the only set, in the vicinity of
Washington, of the Human Relations Area Files, a comprehensive,
systematic inventory of data on a worldwide sample of cultural groups.
Renovation of its office space, work areas, and storage sections in the
Museum of Natural History provides excellent space for SOA’s activ-
ities, and offices for the newly merged professional and subprofessional
staffs. Thus, for the first time since the 19th century, all the anthro-
pological personnel of the Institution is under one roof, and the foun-
dation has been laid for carrying on past activities efficiently and
initiating new anthropological programs of several types.

Publication of the Bulletins of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
which began in 1887, will cease with Bulletin 200, and henceforth
anthropological papers and monographs will appear in the new series
“Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology,” which has a new format
and increased page size that present more effectively such material as
illustrations, tables, and maps. Unlike the Bulletins, the new series
40 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

will include material dealing with the Old World as well as the New.

Research in the Old World was conducted in a few widely scattered
areas. Olga Linares de Sapir, who was appointed a collaborator in
January 1965, began archeological research in Senegal with a post-
doctoral fellowship from the National Science Foundation. This
portion of Africa is one of the least-known archeologically of any part
of the world, and the establishment of a firm sequence of prehistoric
events will be of great importance.

In June, J. Lawrence Angel left for an extended investigation of
human skeletons excavated from Neolithic and other sites in Greece
and Turkey. His work, supported by the American Philosophical
Society and the Wenner-Gren Foundation, continues research in physi-
cal anthropology in Greece, carried on for many years, into the
social biology of culture change.

Field work in the Far East was carried out by William C. Sturtevant,
who from October 1963 to October 1964 was in Burma investigating
the forms, functions, and symbolism of modern Burmese dress. Prior
to returning he visited London to examine archival material on
Burmese dress.

From August 29 to October 30, Richard B. Woodbury examined in
Spain, Libya, Egypt, Pakistan, and Israel a great variety of ancient
and modern water-control systems, especially cisterns, irrigation ditches,
and terraces, for comparison with the New World techniques studied
in the Western United States and in Mexico. The trip, supported by
the National Science Foundation, included visits to abandoned Roman
irrigation works in Libya, modern farms in the Fayum using traditional
water systems, Mohenjo-Daro, a center of intensive irrigation in the
Indus Valley five millennia ago, and the restored Nabatean terraced
farms of the Negev in Israel.

Eugene I. Knez continued research on several aspects of Korean and
Japanese culture, working particularly on a bibliography of Korean
anthropology with emphasis on Asian literature, and on a study of
Japanese ceramic materials in this Institution. He is seeking to relate
the ceramics chronologically to traditional kiln sites in Japan. Knez
also visited several museums to study material aspects of Korean culture
in connection both with future exhibits and a monograph on Korean
village life that he is preparing.

William H. Crocker continued field work with the Canela of Brazil,
with whom he worked in 1963. This small tribe, living in relative
isolation and supporting themselves by a simple pattern of hunting,
gathering, and rudimentary farming, is now undergoing rapid changes
due to the pressure from Brazilian settlers in adjacent areas. Prior to
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-ANTHROPOLOGY 41

his arrival in the field in July 1964, the Canela had been moved from
their savannah habitat to a forested reservation, providing radically
different surroundings, different resources, and a serious challenge to
the continuation of their way of life. Six months before this, a Canela
woman had announced that she was receiving messages transmitted by
the motions of her unborn child. These messages were thought to be
instructions from the Canela culture hero who announced in this way
that when the child was born he would transform the Canela world
into a city with all the comforts and machines necessary to make life
easy. In accordance with his directions, this prophetess proceeded to
bring together several scattered villages, create a new pattern of danc-
ing, order the selling of personal belongings to buy goods, and direct
the stealing of cattle from neighboring settlers for consumption during
festivals. Although her child was stillborn in May, she managed to
redirect the movement into new rites adopting Catholic elements.
Shortly after this the Canela were attacked, and several were killed and
others wounded by the settlers whose cattle they had been stealing.

The prophetess, Maria, had predicted the enemy bullets would all
miss their mark because the culture hero would protect them. With
the total failure of her predictions and the death of several Canela, her
power and her cult movement became discredited. In 1963 the Canela
had been resettled, and when Crocker and his wife arrived in the field
they were able to study firsthand the effects of this drastic sequence of
events to which the Canela had been subjected. He is analyzing his
data in terms of three approaches: social, psychological, and ecological.
Socially, the Canela have been little affected by this traumatic move,
since their social system continues to function in their new external
social environment, to which they have adjusted with their usual and
remarkable flexibility. Psychologically, however, there is evidence of
a great deal of suppressed hostility which is likely to find an outlet in
the near future, both against themselves and against neighbors. So
far this hostility has affected in only minor ways their motivations and
outlook, but some Canela already are preferring helplessness and an
admission of failure to the creating of a new life. They blame their
predicament on civilization and not themselves.

Ecologically the problems are much greater: because they have not
adjusted to the necessities of forest living and its greater need for sani-
tation, disease rates, especially tuberculosis, have risen sharply; having
failed to learn to hunt in the forest, they suffer from a scarcity of meat
and considerable undernourishment; and because many materials
available in the savannah, and needed to carry out their customary
practices or to keep certain taboos, are unavailable in the forest, a
42 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

number of practices and related beliefs are rapidly being lost and con-
fidence and faith in their old traditions are being weakened. Crocker
has supplemented these field observations with extensive linguistic
work and kinship analysis, and a substantial series of photographs. His
field work, supported by the National Science Foundation and the
Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, is expected to
result in a major monograph.

The opportunity for Crocker to make on-the-spot observations of
these rapid and traumatic changes is almost unique, as anthropologists
have so often been forced by circumstances to rely on secondhand
accounts or on interviews with survivors of such rapid changes, made
years after the events took place. His results will be of importance far
beyond any interest we have in the fate of this small group of Brazilian
Indians, as they will make clearer the processes by which human groups
respond to, adjust to, or break down under the impact of sudden,
overwhelming changes imposed from outside sources. Since much of
the world today is in the midst of rapid and unprecedented change,
any of his conclusions will have very wide significance.

A very different type of field work is represented by the trip of Clifford
Evans and Betty J. Meggers to Brazil from October 5 to November
22,1964. The teaching aspects of this trip, supported by the Fulbright
Commission, are described on page 50. In addition, they were able
to make an extensive inspection tour of departments of anthropology
at various universities and museums throughout Brazil in order to
determine needs and potentials for archeological research programs.
By becoming familiar at firsthand with the collections and facilities,
and, even more importantly, with the personnel, of Brazilian institutions,
they were able to lay a groundwork for a long-term cooperative program
in Brazilian archeology in which they will have the support and co-
operation of a large proportion of the promising younger Brazilian
scholars. Such a coordinated program will make possible the securing
of data under carefully planned conditions, strictly comparable and
useful to scholars elsewhere in Brazil and throughout the world.

During the Brazilian trip, Evans and Meggers worked with Mario
Sim6es at the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belém, Para, on sherds
from stratigraphic excavations at a locality on Marajé Island, not
investigated by them in their 1948-49 excavations there. The new
material could be interdigitated into the previously published sequence,
and they extended it back to earlier time periods with a substantial
amount of material. This new work is of special importance because
carbon samples were secured by SimGes and his coworker Napoleao
Figueiredo, to be tested at the carbon-dating laboratory of the Smith-
sonian’s Radiation Biology Laboratory. The results, it is hoped, will
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—ANTHROPOLOGY 43

provide the first absolute dates for the archeology of Marajé Island, a
key locality in the prehistory of the entire South American lowlands.

A pre-doctoral fellowship from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for
Anthropological Research made it possible for Yoshio Onuki, of the
University of Tokyo Andes Expedition, to spend six months at the
Museum analyzing and studying a large collection of potsherds, received
from the University of Tokyo Andes Expedition through the courtesy
of its director, Professor Seiichi Izumi. It includes type specimens for
the entire range of Formative Period materials from the site of Kotosh
in the Department of Huanuco, Peru, and is of particular importance
for comparative purposes in view of the interest of Meggers, Evans, and
Flannery in the Formative Period of Mesoamerica and South America.

From January to April 1965, Robert M. Laughlin was in Zinacantan,
Chiapas, Mexico, with support from the National Institute of Mental
Health, continuing his study of the Tzotzil Indians, one of the surviving
Maya-speaking descendants of the famous prehistoric Maya Indians of
Central America. He has concentrated on the elicitation, through
systematic procedures, of the entire vocabulary of the Tzotzil language,
both as a basis for a Tzotzil dictionary and, even more important, as a
means of determining the ideas, concepts, and attitudes that lie behind
the more visible and material segments of Tzotzil culture. Prior to
this field work, he continued the analysis of myth and dream material
previously collected, as a means of determining the values implicit in
Tzotzil culture. Both of these approaches are significant means of
securing data on the more intangible and frequently ignored aspects
of a primitive culture.

Kent V. Flannery, who joined the staff on July 8, 1964, continued
research on both the Old and the New World with parallel programs
dealing with the beginnings of domestic plants and animals in two key
localities—southwestern Iran and central and southern Mexico. From
July through September he was at Rice University studying more than
10,000 identifiable bone fragments from prehistoric caves and villages
in the Deh Luran valley, Khuzistan, Iran. Shedding light on the
important problem of the beginnings of domestication of sheep, goat,
cattle, and the dog, these came from three archeological sites which
spanned the time from about 7900 B.C. through the beginnings of town
life about 4500 B.C. to the threshold of urban civilization about 3800
B.C. Among the important conclusions he reached is that agriculture
began in this region with the very small-scale, almost incidental,
growing of wheat and barley in forms closely related to their wild ances-
tors, and that only later were the techniques added by which farming
became the mainstay of life. He also concluded that goats were domes-
44 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

ticated substantially earlier than sheep, the latter apparently being
imported from distant areas after their domestication there. The
botanist Hans Helbaek, working with the expedition, has shown through
the study of details of the flax seeds that irrigation of at least this crop,
and presumably of wheat and other crops as well, began some six
millennia before the Christian era in this region—much earlier than
had heretofore been suspected.

In December 1964, with the cooperation of Mexican authorities,
and particularly of Ignacio Bernal, director of the Museo de Antro-
pologia in Mexico City, Flannery was able to visit many of the 200
already-located sites in the valley of Oaxaca. These will provide the
basis for a major archeological study of the beginnings of agriculture in
this area and of prehistoric human ecology during the centuries which
span the beginnings of village life and the growth of villages into towns,
and which led to the foundation of civilization in Mexico. Numerous
caves or rock shelters, appearing to cover the period from 6500-2500
B.C., were found. These assure abundant perishable archeological
materials such as corncobs, fragments of squash, cactus fruits, twine,
and so on. When plans now complete are carried out next year, the
study will parallel the important Tehuacan Project in which Flannery
and Richard B. Woodbury have both participated in previous years.
The intensive archeological study of key areas in such regions as Middle
America, through cooperative programs with botanists, zoologists,
archeologists, and others, is providing far fuller and more meaningful
data than have heretofore been available. Both in Flannery’s Iranian
work, now nearing completion, and in the contemplated work in Oaxaca,
close collaboration with other specialists within the Museum of Natural
History is proving extremely rewarding, as a result of the generosity
with which they make available their particular talents in a variety of
fields.

Gus W. Van Beek made substantial progress on his study of South
Arabic ceramic technology and architecture in conjunction with the
preparation of his final report on the excavations at Jahar Bin Humeid.

Before and after the meeting of the 7th International Congress of
Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences which he attended in
Moscow, August 3-10, Henry B. Collins studied museum collections
in Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, Moscow, Leningrad, and
Tblissi. Saul H. Riesenberg, who attended the same mectings, also
studied Pacific collections in several of the same museums.

Riesenberg completed his research on migrations and movements of
people in Micronesia. He also carried forward his research projects
on Ponapean political organization and folklore.

Gordon D. Gibson continued his researches on African material
culture as part of the preparation of new exhibits in the hall of African
cultures.

J. Lawrence Angel continued, for the third and final year, his re-
study of senior medical students whom he first studied as freshmen
at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. Changes in body
composition, blood serum make-up, body measurements, and external
appearance recorded in this study will clarify the process of differential
aging in man.

Lucile E. Hoyme visited the Department of Anatomy, Washington
University Medical School, St. Louis, in November and December
1964, to make observations on about 175 human pelves of known
age and sex, to supplement data already recorded on U.S. Negro
pelves at Howard University and American Indian and Eskimo
specimens at the Museum of Natural History.

Waldo R. Wedel continued research in the Plains during July and
August 1964, with support from a National Science Foundation grant.
Accompanied in the field by George S. Metcalf and Edgar W. Dodd,
his survey had two objectives: to clarify the relationships among
several late prehistoric and early historic Indian groups—those defined
for the Central Plains, for the upper Rio Grande area of New Mexico,
and the southern plains of Oklahoma; and to assess the nature of
ecological adjustments made by pre-white peoples in the transitional
zone where the subhumid eastern prairie plains environment gives
way to a semiarid short-grass or steppe environment on the west.
The area of study was selected because hitherto it has been little ex-
amined but is adjacent to better known areas providing material for
comparative study and cross dating. From a base camp in Kansas
at the Meade County State Game Farm, dune and blowout localities
along the Cimarron River and its tributaries as far west as the Colorado
line were checked. Visits were also made to the Crooked Creek
Valley and to localities on the Medicine Lodge River and on the Salt
Fork of the Arkansas River.

In the western part of this area, where the Cimarron crosses the
High Plains, pottery-bearing sites were small and scarce, often with
little but a few sherds and flints. Grinding stones, however, and some
of the many chipped-stone tools suggest aboriginal occupation ranging
in time from the Archaic period of several thousand years ago to his-
toric times, the latter represented by iron arrow points. Fluted or
46 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

lanceolate blades, indicative of Clovis and Folsom or of the Eden
and Scottsbluff complexes, respectively, were extremely scarce.
Non-pottery sites, marked by quantities of stone artifacts and refuse
and by clusters of hearth stones, were, however, surprisingly numerous,
apparently coming to light wherever the sandy soils along the Cimarron
have been blown away to expose former ground surfaces.

Farther east, pottery-bearing sites with an inferred semihorticultural
subsistence basis included several that merit further study. These had
pottery identifiable as belonging to the Woodland period before about
A.D. 900, to the Central Plains complex of about 1000-1450, and to
the Dismal River complex of about 1650-1750. Pottery-bearing sites
tended to occur in the immediate vicinity of springs or other depend-
able surface water supplies, some of which have almost totally dried
up in the past 50 years, thus materially changing the appearance
of the landscape and its apparent potential for farming occupants.
Potsherds originating from the Pueblo settlements on the upper Rio
Grande were seen in local collections and were coliected from a number
of sites visited; these are being examined by experts in New Mexico
for identification and dating.

The general impression from the summer’s work is that semiseden-
tary, probably horticultural settlements, more closely related to late
prehistoric cultures of central Oklahoma than to the Central Plains
cultures north of the Arkansas River, occurred at least as far west as
Meade County. Farther west were more transient economies based
primarily on seasonal hunting and gathering, with springs and ponds
as foci of human interest and with winter residence elsewhere than in
these treeless, windswept, inhospitable steppe lands.

Special attention by aerial and ground reconnaissance was given to
the vicinity of Englewood, Kans., where traces remain of fairly extensive
irrigation systems no longer in use. Persistent local traditions and
archeological reports of the 1930’s specify that these are, in part, of
prehistoric Indian origin. No evidence was found, however, either in
the remaining ditches themselves or in the scanty archeological sites of
the locality, to support the view that there was ever a prewhite popu-
lation sufficiently numerous, settled, or advanced technologically, to
have constructed such irrigation works as are now visible.

River Basin Surveys

As in previous years, by far the most extensive field activities in
archeology for the Smithsonian Institution were carried on by the
River Basin Surveys in the Missouri River Basin. This was their 19th
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-ANTHROPOLOGY 47

year of continuous operation and again included large-scale excavation,
surveys of lesser known areas, processing and analysis of specimens from
excavations, and the preparation of reports of results. During the year
23 field parties worked within the Missouri Basin, of which 11 were
in the field in July, August, or September 1964, in the following places:

1. The Sommers Site, Upper Big Bend Reservoir, S. Dak., one of
the largest in the reservoir area, with at least 50 house depressions but
unfortunately with heavy overburden, requiring the use of drag line
and bulldozer to reach house floors.

2. The Fort George Site, a small fortified earth-lodge village near
Pierre, S. Dak. Both the pottery and the objects of glass, iron, and
brass suggested occupation in the first half of the 18th century, probably
by the protohistoric Arikara.

3. The Chapelle Creek Site, 20 miles downstream from Pierre,
where previous disturbance by amateur excavators and the rise of
water resulting in waterlogging, limited severely the extent of excavation.

4. Anumber of sites on the right bank of the Missouri in the Upper
Big Bend Reservoir in which extensive test excavations suggested occu-
pation from the Middle Missouri period through the time of the
modern Dakota Indians.

5. The Davis Site and the Larson Site near Mobridge, S. Dak.
At the latter, skeletons on the floors of the most recently occupied
houses and associated musket balls and copper arrow points indicated
clearly that occupation extended from prehistoric times into historic.

6. The Stelzer Site, near Mobridge, the largest known Woodland
burial and occupation site along the middle Missouri.

7. Calamity Village, also near Mobridge, a small site protected by
moats and palisades and located on a small spur of land overlooking
the river.

8. Some 30 sites, either newly found or tested in accordance with
recommendations from previous years, in the Yellowtail Reservoir on
the Big Horn in southern Montana and northern Wyoming. The
most important of these was Bottleneck Cave, a deep rock shelter
containing at least five prehistoric occupations extending back to the
paleo-Indian time level.

9. Several new sites were found on a shoreline survey of the west
bank of the Fort Randall Reservoir, S. Dak. The degree of damage
to surviving archeological sites by bank erosion was evaluated, and the
need for additional testing or excavation was determined.

10. A survey in the Rathbun Reservoir on the Chariton River,
Iowa, with emphasis on the revisiting of previously known sites, par-
ticularly six major mound groups overlooking the flood plain. Exten-
48 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

sive tests yielded stratigraphic information but no cultural material
serving to identify the mounds with a known complex or to date them.
11. A brief reconnaissance of sites in the Upper Oahe Reservoir to
assess the needs for future excavation.
In April, May, and June, 1965, 12 additional field parties undertook
field work, as follows:

1. Survey of three reservoirs in eastern Kansas: the Onaga Reser-
voir on the Vermillion River, the Hillsdale Reservoir on the Osage
River, and the Garnett Reservoir on Pottawatomie Creek.

2. A short reconnaissance of several Missouri River mainstem reser-
voirs: Gavins Point, Fort Randall, and Oahe, with special attention to
sites being actively eroded.

3. The beginning of test excavation and large-scale work at a site
near Fort Yates in the Oahe Reservoir area.

4. A 1965 continuation of work at the Sommers Site designed
especially to clear additional long rectangular houses, to test non-
residential areas, and to examine possible evidence of a defensive
perimeter.

5. Excavations in the Upper Oahe Reservoir at another site with
large, long, rectangular houses.

6. Work at Fort Manuel, an important fur-trade post in northern-
most South Dakota.

7. A continuation in the Rathbun Reservoir, Iowa, of work begun
in the fall of 1964.

8. Further work in the Upper Big Bend Reservoir where sites had
been damaged by recent construction or threatened by recreational
development of the area.

9. Work in the Garrison Diversion Project of North Dakota, begun
late in the fiscal year to survey and test selected sites.

10. A revisit to the Upper Yellowtail Reservoir to obtain palyno-
logical and soil samples from selected locations.

11. Work at the Aycock Site in the Oahe Reservoir.

12. Work in the Upper Big Bend Reservoir.

In addition to the field parties from the Lincoln office of the River
Basin Surveys, a number of institutions cooperated in 1964 in carrying
out significant field work in the Missouri Basin; these included Iowa
State University, Kansas State Historical Society, the University of
Missouri, the University of Nebraska, the Science Museum of the St.
Paul Institute, Minnesota, the State Historical Society of North Dakota,
and the State University of South Dakota. Each of these had field
parties carrying on salvage excavations or survey work in areas of
immediate concern to them. At the end of the fiscal year five cooper-
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-ANTHROPOLOGY 49

ating institutions again had field parties in the Missouri Basin: the
University of Nebraska excavating in the Glen Elder and Milford
Reservoirs of Kansas; the University of Kansas working in the Perry,
Clinton, and Kirwin Reservoirs of Kansas; the Kansas State Historical
Society, also excavating in the Perry Reservoir; the University of Mis-
souri, continuing work in the Kaysinger Bluff and Stockton Reservoirs of
Missouri; and the State Historical Society of North Dakota, excavating
at the Shermer Site in the Oahe Reservoir.

One of the important undertakings of the River Basin Surveys has
been the Missouri Basin Chronology Program which recently has in-
cluded, by cooperative agreement with the U.S. National Park Service,
a review of dendrochronological data on the Plains area, being carried
out by the Tree Ring Laboratory of the University of Arizona. Initial
indications are encouraging for the future development of dendro-
chronology in the Plains as a supplement to other less precise chrono-
logical systems.

Other Scientific Activities

Henry B. Collins continued to serve as a member of the Board of
Governors of the Arctic Institute of North America, which he helped
to found in 1945, and as chairman of the directing committee of its
comprehensive “‘Arctic Bibliography,” in which are indexed and sum-
marized the contents of publications in all fields of science and all Jan-
guages pertaining to the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of the world.
Volume 12, prepared for publication during the year, will contain ab-
stracts in English of 7,270 papers and monographs, 94 percent of which
were published between 1960 and 1962. Of these, approximately half
are in English, almost as many in Russian, and the majority of the re-
mainder are Scandinavian, German, and French. Collins also con-
tinued as chairman of the advisory committee of the Institute’s Rus-
sian Translation Project, which he organized in 1960. With a grant
from the National Science Foundation, the editing of the fifth volume
of the series, ““The Archeology and Geomorphology of Northern
Asia: Selected Papers,” was completed for publication by the Univer-
sity of Toronto Press in 1964; and a sixth volume, consisting of papers
on Siberian archeology, was expected before the end of 1965. Prior
to the merger of the Bureau of American Ethnology into the Smith-
sonian Office of Anthropology, Collins served for a year and a half
as Acting Director of the Bureau.

W. H. Crocker continued as a contributing editor for South Amer-
ican ethnology for ‘‘The Handbook of Latin American Studies” of
50 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress. In that capacity
he surveyed about 800 articles or books published from 1960 to 1964
in this particular field and prepared critical abstracts of over 400 of
the items for use in the Handbook.

At the invitation of the Fulbright Commission of Brazil, C. Evans
and B. J. Meggers received travel grants in order to give in Brazil
an intensive training course on archeological method and interpre-
tation to a select group of Brazilian archeologists at the University
of Parana. This program, conducted October 5-30, 1964, was held
at the Museu Paranaguense de Arqueologia e Artes Populares in
Paranagua and at the Department of Anthropology at the Univer-
sity of Parana in Curitiba. It was held in seminar form, six days a
week. Mornings were devoted to lectures on archeological theory and
a review of the latest information on New World archeology. After-
noons were devoted to practical workshop sessions with specimens in
order to show methods of classifying pottery, of seriating sequences,
of writing pottery type descriptions, of reconstructing regional se-
quences, and of determining the cultural history of aboriginal
Brazil. Evenings were devoted to discussions of general problems
in Brazilian archeology, the planning of field research, and the or-
ganizing of common themes for study and presentation at the 1966
International Congress of Americanists to be held in Argentina.

The seminar was highly successful, both in training and developing
the interest of a group of able young Brazilian archeologists, and in
providing the Smithsonian Institution with new contacts and an aware-
ness of current research in this region. The seminar also made possible
the planning of a comprehensive, long-range research program for
key areas of Brazil hitherto neglected or investigated only by outmoded,
inadequate methods that produce results not comparable with those
of other areas. The young scholars participating, it is hoped, will
be able to collaborate with Smithsonian archeologists in this program,
both carrying on their own research in Brazil and visiting the Museum
of Natural History for short periods for conferences and additional
training programs, and for comparative study of collections not avail-
able in Brazil.

VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Although the horizons of research in vertebrate zoology are con-
tinually expanding, this does not reduce the importance of taxonomic
studies at the “‘alpha”’ level in many groups, nor does it eliminate the
continuing need for field collecting, particularly in less well-known
parts of the world, such as the tropics.

Fishes are taxonomically the least well-known vertebrates, and re-
search on this group involves to a great extent the description of new
forms and revisions at the generic and higher levels. Victor G.
Springer is carrying out revisionary studies of blennioid fishes and re-
cently completed the examination of material for a world revision of
the genus Entomacrodus. ‘This work is one of the few intensive studies
of a circumglobal genus of marine shore fishes based on abundant
material.

William R. Taylor is studying speciation, relationships, morphology,
and distribution of several families of marine and freshwater catfishes.

Stanley H. Weitzman’s current and projected research includes
studies on the morphology and evolution of stomiatoid fishes, especially
the deep-sea fish families Astronesthidae, Melanostomiatidae, and
Gonostomatidae. He is also continuing work on the morphology,
evolution, and classification of the large South American and African
suborder of freshwater characi fishes, Characoidei.

Robert H. Gibbs, Jr., and several colleagues are studying the bathy-
pelagic fishes collected on two north-south transects in the western
Indian Ocean during two cruises of the International Indian Ocean
Expedition. The relationship of the distribution of species to physico-
chemical and biological properties of the oceans is receiving much
attention. Gibbs also neared completion of an ecological analysis of
pelagic oceanic fishes, collected 1956-1960 from the M/V Delaware,
and continued study of Atlantic Ocean flyingfishes.

Ernest A. Lachner recently completed a study of certain North
American barbel minnows. Robert E. Jenkins, graduate student,
Cornell University, and Robert Ross, professor at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute, over the past several years have amassed thousands of speci-

789-427 66——_9
54 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

mens from central Appalachia using electric shocking devices. Jenkins
and Lachner have analyzed the river populations of these nest-building
chubs (genus Hybopsis, subgenus Nocomis). ‘Their studies concern the
ecology, distribution, origin, and dispersal of the several species and
their infraspecific populations in relation to preglacial and postglacial
stream captures and avenues of dispersal.

In the division of reptiles and amphibians a major manuscript on
the frogs of Colombia was completed by Doris M. Cochran in collabo-
ration with Coleman J. Goin of the University of Florida.

James A. Peters is studying the systematics and ecology of the reptiles
and amphibians of Ecuador, including analysis of the results of six
ecological transects made through the Subalpine, Transition, Cloud
Forest, Subtropical, and Tropical Zones of the eastern slopes of the
Andes. The area, almost totally unknown ecologically, is an evolution-
ary microcosm, with striking examples of barrier formation and accom-
panying speciation, altitudinal zonation, ecological indicator species,
populational and community differentiation, and micro-faunules.
Field studies in Ecuador of comparative cardiac physiology (with
Robert Mullen, supported by the National Institutes of Health) re-
sulted in the first known electrocardiograms of caecilians, the rare
legless amphibians, and a large series of electrocardiograph records of
Ecuadorian snakes and lizards, which will ultimately provide a contri-
bution to physio-ecological studies of phylogenetic relationships.

Peters also published a dictionary which contains over 3500 words
and terms descriptive of the biology of the reptiles and amphibians,
including material drawn from such other disciplines as behavior,
genetics, ecology, physiology, and pathology, as well as systematics
and morphology.

Research on birds has a strong ecological orientation, with empha-
sis on sea birds in four of the world’s oceans and land birds in Latin
America.

George E. Watson has developed a cooperative research program
with the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries to study the distribution,
abundance, and behavior of sea birds in association with fish schools in
the tropical Atlantic Ocean. He participated in a cruise aboard the
Bureau ship Geronimo in the Gulf of Guinea in August and aboard the
Woods Hole research vessel Atlantis IJ off northern South America from -
October to December. These resulted in the production of an illus-
trated preliminary identification manual designed to facilitate collection
of reliable data on the distribution of pelagic birds. With J. Phillip
Angle as assistant, Watson is working on a similar manual for Antarctic
birds on a grant from the National Science Foundation. They gathered

RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY 55

data aboard the aircraft carrier Croaton, used as a mobile launch facility
by NASA, off the west coast of South America in April. Frank B. Gill,
research assistant, returned to the United States after 15 months on the
International Indian Ocean Expedition.

The Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program, of which Philip S.
Humphrey is the principal investigator, reached the end of its first
phase of general survey work at the end of June 1965. An inventory of
the terrestrial organisms and seasonal variations in their distribution
and abundance has been made in the study area, and preparation has
begun for a series of survey reports on an island-by-island basis.

Humphrey’s other research activities during the year mostly con-
cerned studies of the distribution and ecology of Latin American birds.
He continued field studies of the ecological and seasonal distribution
of birds and arboviruses in the tropical rain forest in cooperation with
Robert E. Shope of the Belém Virus Laboratory in Brazil under a grant
from the Rockefeller Foundation. During the dry season they gathered
comparative ecological data in the same study area used during the
rainy season in 1963. Humphrey also continued his research on
Patagonian birds, assisted by David Bridge.

Paul Slud, a specialist in tropical ecology, joined the staff in July 1964
and left almost immediately for a year of field work in Costa Rica.
He is part of a team working on a bioecological classification for mili-
tary environments supported by the Army Research Office. An im-
portant objective has been to study a variety of habitats in detail in
order to classify and predict plant formations and the distribution of
birds.

Alexander Wetmore continued his studies of birds of the Isthmus of
Panama and was in the field from January through March.

Richard L. Zusi made considerable research progress in functional
anatomy and adaptation, completing in collaboration with Robert W.
Storer of the University of Michigan one manuscript comparing head
and neck anatomy in the pied-billed grebe with that of the rare giant
pied-bill, and another on the mechanism of kinetics in the bird skull.
His other studies in progress include adaptive radiation in shorebirds,
for which he obtained useful data and motion pictures during field
work in Kansas and Florida. He is working on a joint study of the
evolution of the woodhewers, a group of tropical American tree-trunk
climbing birds, with Paul Slud, who has contributed specimens and field
observations from Costa Rica.

In mammals, research is oriented mostly toward studies of tropical
faunas which are far less well-known than those of temperate areas.
Much of this work is done in cooperation with specialists of other
56 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

disciplines. For example, Henry W. Setzer works extensively with
parasitologists in his faunal studies, supported by the Office of the
Surgeon General, Department of the Army. This year he conducted
field work in Mozambique in July and August, and throughout the
year he supervised a field team working in Iran and Pakistan and two
others working in Mozambique and Bechuanaland, each including
entomologists as well as mammalogists.

In cooperation with Vernon Tipton, Brooke Army Medical Center,
Fort Sam Houston, Tex., Charles O. Handley, Jr., began work on a
study of the distribution and ecology of mammalian ectoparasites,
arboviruses, and their hosts in Venezuela, with support by the Office
of the Surgeon General. On the project staff are 11 parasitologists, a
virologist, and an ecologist. With support from the National Science
Foundation, Handley also directed field work in Panama and in the
southeastern United States.

David H. Johnson is studying some of the Far Eastern species of the
genus Rattus as a part of a comprehensive study of the mammals of
southeastern Asia.

INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Invertebrate animals are still so little known with respect to their kinds
and diversity, their distributions, and the mechanisms that control these
distributions, that much research in invertebrate zoology is necessarily
fundamental and exploratory. It is still preoccupied with “alpha”
taxonomy—the exploratory phases of systematics. The range of this
research exploration extends from the Antarctic to the Arctic and
includes all of the oceans of the world. Some of the activities de-
scribed below illustrate the nature of the department’s research and
predict the far-reaching conclusions which someday may follow these
preliminary studies.

The International Indian Ocean Expedition, concluded this year, has
provided a unique opportunity for American zoologists to cooperate in
a full-time biological! effort in one of the least known areas of the world.
Many members of the department have participated. Joseph Rose-
water completed a study of the tridacnid clams of the Indo-Pacific, in
part based upon the collections made during participation in Te Vega
Cruise A and earlier observations made at Eniwetok Atoll. He is now
considering the littorinid snails of the Indo-Pacific region, using these
same collections and others from western Malaysia, Thailand, and the
islands south of Sumatra. Charles E. Cutress, Jr., who collected exten-
sively along the Indian coast in 1963, has been describing certain of the
sea anemones.

Louis S. Kornicker, aboard Te Vega for Cruise B during early 1964,
collected from Ceylon to the Maldive Islands. He returned in Novem-
ber and December to cruise the East African coast and the coral reefs
of the western Indian Ocean aboard Anton Bruun on Cruise 9. The
myodocopid ostracods he obtained will provide the nucleus for study
of these little-known forms in the Indian Ocean. To provide com-
parative materials for his studies, Kornicker also collected from
the Bahamas and other areas from which few reference materials exist
in most museum collections.

Museum technician T. Peter Lowe made important and significant
collections of deep-water corals from south of the Malagasy Republic.
60 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

These specimens provide an index to the northern boundary of the
Southern Ocean fauna under study by Donald F. Squires. Although
temperatures at great depths in the ocean are quite low, there appears
to be a clear-cut faunal demarcation between a “deep-water tropical
fauna” and the deep-water corals of the Southern Ocean. Lowe also
collected reef corals from some of the more southerly coral reefs during
stops at ports in the Malagasy Republic.

Among the many intriguing studies of marine invertebrates are those
concerned with planktonic faunas, for these organisms live throughout
their lives in a medium in motion and therefore are dynamic both
spatially and temporally. Thomas E. Bowman, in his analysis of the
planktonic copepod crustaceans, has been considering the striking zona-
tion of species which occurs in an inshore-offshore progression. ‘The
zones appear to represent a series of communities which replace each
other from shallow neritic to deeper oceanic waters. Each of these
faunas inhabits water masses having potentially definable physical
characteristics; therefore, they are indicators of these water bodies.
Studies made on the distribution of two species of a genus of planktonic
shrimp indicate that these striking and easily identifiable forms could
be used for very rapid identification of some of these water bodies.
The results of this study have potential importance in understanding
the ecological basis of the fisheries off the southeastern coast of the
United States. Incidental to this research, Bowman has been con-
sidering the distribution of certain aquatic cave isopods from various
regions of the Americas, and he presented a paper on the evolution of
these forms to the Society of Systematic Zoology.

Western Atlantic stomatopods, which may become important as a
food source, were subjected to further study by Raymond B. Manning,
who is concluding his monographic treatment of this group. An ex-
tension of these studies to the eastern Atlantic was made possible by his
participation, both this year and last year, in cruises to the Gulf of
Guinea aboard the University of Miami research vessel Pillsbury. His
studies include investigations of the planktonic larvae of the stomato-
pods. In conjunction with his field-based studies, Manning completed
a revision of the Australian and New Zealand stomatopods.

Other studies of the invertebrates of the eastern United States region
were carried out by Meredith L. Jones, Marian H. Pettibone, and W.
Duane Hope. Jones, who continues his long-range program of research
upon the tropical polychaete faunas, engaged in field work in the area
of Margarita Island, Venezuela, and off Key West, Fla. He also com-
pleted an analysis of the spatial distribution of some marine benthic
invertebrates in San Francisco Bay, Calif. Such an analysis, made

In Tonga, members of the biology class of Tonga College were recruited by
Curator Harald Rehder to collect mollusks from the flat behind the raised
Ha’ateiho Reef on Tongatapu. Below: In the laboratory, Rehder makes

upon collections taken with a special sampling device, permits a better
understanding of the community structure of small organisms and may
ultimately give us insight into some aspects of their behavior, but
it can be carried out only in those areas where the organisms are
sufficiently well known to permit identifications.

It is toward this higher level of understanding that research such as
that of Pettibone is directed. She continues her detailed studies of the
polychaetes of the New England region, extending from Nova Scotia
south to Cape Hatteras, and is preparing another in her series of mono-
graphs on this fauna. Polychaete worms, which constitute a large pro-
portion, by mass, of animals in many marine environments, are poorly
known and difficult to study. It is only through long-range projects
resulting in monographic taxonomic treatments for the identification
of these animals that other biological studies can progress.

Revisional studies are often possible only after long experience with
the fauna of a region or with a smaller group of organisms with which
one has had vast experience. The summary of a lifetime of work with
such a group is the objective of research associate Waldo L. Schmitt,
who is studying the New World species of pinnotherid crabs. This
study, in which Schmitt brings together what is known of the diversity
and distribution of these crabs, will permit a better understanding of
their position in the evolution of the crustacea and make possible mean-
ingful studies of their ecology and their role in the marine environment.

The work of systematics often extends beyond descriptive analyses of
species. W. Duane Hope has been considering seasonal distribution of
marine nematode worms in the Woods Hole, Mass., region. The nema-
tode fauna reflects the variable seasonal environments, as well as local,
stable habitats which might be due to a single aberrant ecological
parameter, such as the sediment type. A description of a fauna such
as the nematodes, in this region, requires, therefore, a knowledge of
distribution mechanisms, as well as of the methods by which the indi-
vidual species may be recognized. This program of research has been
underway since September, when Hope joined the departmental staff,
and is being conducted in cooperation with the Systematics-Ecology
Program of the Marine Biological Laboratory of Woods Hole.

J. Laurens Barnard, whose association with the Smithsonian began
in August, has continued his studies of the benthic amphipods of the
California coast, particularly those of the intertidal zone from Monterey
Bay, Calif., to Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California. Upon comple-
tion of this study, which is expected early next year, Barnard will
commence investigations of the benthic Antarctic amphipods.

Broad-scale zoogeographic studies such as that to be commenced by
Barnard are already underway in the Antarctic region, or more

properly in the Southern Ocean (the southern portions of the Atlantic,
Pacific, and Indian Oceans), by David L. Pawson and Donald F.
Squires. Pawson has been concerned with the systematics and distri-
bution of holothuroids (sea cucumbers) and echinoids (sea urchins),
particularly those of the New Zealand and Australian regions. Squires’
long-range program on Southern Ocean corals likewise has been con-
centrated in the above regions. But both investigators expect to ex-
tend their area of interest into the Southern Pacific, which is virtually
unknown biologically. The emphasis on the New Zealand and Aus-
tralian regions is not accidental, for New Zealand lies athwart the
boundary between the subtropical and sub-Antarctic faunas, and the
relationship between the faunas of New Zealand and those of the
Antarctic sheds light on the paths of migration of these faunas and on
their history.

It is well known that faunas are most diverse toward the center of
their distribution but become attenuated or less diverse near the periph-
ery. Only the more hardy species can live in the often marginal
ecological conditions which exist in peripheral regions. ‘The applica-
tion of this principle to the molluscan faunas of the marginal tropical
Pacific areas is the subject of research by Harald A. Rehder. The
immensely diverse molluscan faunas found in the tropical coral reefs
of the Pacific Ocean become less diverse in the island groups on the
edge of the coral-reef area. The diminution of these faunas reflects
their isolation, as well as their more severe environments; knowledge of
the diversity and composition of the faunas is essential for an under-
standing of the causes of such diminution. ‘To accumulate the data for
his studies, Rehder spent four months in southeastern Polynesia and
supervises a continuing program of field collection.

Although the major interest of the department is in the marine forms
of life, there has been some activity toward better understanding of
freshwater and terrestrial species. Horton H. Hobbs, jr., who has
been engaged in studies of the evolutionary history of crayfish and their
commensal entocytherid ostracods, has engaged in a project on the
freshwater and terrestrial decapods of the Antillean Islands. A report
being prepared jointly with Fenner A. Chace, Jr., deals with the fauna
of Dominica, surveyed as a part of the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian
biological survey of Dominica. ‘This work is a continuation of studies
of the North American crayfishes and those of the Mexican region
which have doubled the known species of these important organisms,
used frequently in experimental and behavioral studies. In connection
with his taxonomic studies, Hobbs conducted field work in the south-
eastern United States, particularly in Louisiana.

Joseph P. E. Morrison, who continues work upon brackish-water
mollusks, also collected in the southeastern United States and the U.S.
Virgin Islands. Mrs. Mildred Stratton Wilson, who has been mono-
graphing the freshwater calanoid copepod crustaceans of North Amer-
ica, in an attempt to develop a geographic and physiographic index to
the faunal composition of individual bodies of water, had her work
delayed as a result of damage to her laboratory and library in the
Alaskan earthquake of 1964.

ENTOMOLOGY

Throughout the department there has been marked activity in the
field and in basic research this year. Paul J. Spangler completed his
study of Peruvian water beetles for the Academy of Natural Sciences
of Philadelphia. Both larvae and adults were included in this work,
which included the description of two new genera and 12 new species,
all represented by 129 illustrations. Spangler also continued his
studies toward a revision of the important water-beetle genus Tropr-
sternus. Members of this Western Hemisphere genus have been shown
to be intermediate hosts of several important internal parasites, notably
a tapeworm cysticercoid and the thorny-headed worm, both affecting
swine in Puerto Rico. Certain species are implicated in the trans-
mission of botulism to waterfowl. Other species of Tvropzsternus are
host to many species of fungi being studied by mycologists. One of
the most significant of Spangler’s accomplishments was his discovery
of the snail Planorbina glabrata (Say)—the intermediate host of the
principal helminthic diseases of man, schistosomiaisis—on the island of
Dominica while he was participating in the Bredin-Archbold-Smith-
sonian biological survey of Dominica.

Oscar L. Cartwright is continuing his research on the scarab-beetle
genus Ataenius, which consists of about 300 described species; he spent
two months studying types in the British Museum (Natural History)
and the Muséum d’Histoire naturelle, Paris.

Research associate Doris H. Blake continued her study of the Chrys-
omelidae of the Western Hemisphere. She completed two papers and
is presently revising the genus Glyptoscelis. Mrs. Blake devoted five
weeks to research at the Science Museum, Institute of Jamaica, and
on several field trips there she acquired new material for the national
collection.

Richard C. Froeschner completed a revision of the cactus plant
bugs (family Miridae) which makes available names to be used in
ecological studies of insects important to the culture and control of
cacti. Clarification of the nomenclature of the burrower bugs (Cyd-
nidae) was accomplished by the fixation of correct names.
66 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Research associate Carl J. Drake continued his investigations of the
lacebugs (Tingidae) of Madagascar, the Congo, and the Americas, but
the publication of his 634-page catalog, Lacebugs of the World, is the
most significant contribution to the knowledge of this group of insects that
has ever appeared and is the culmination of a lifetime of research and
investigation. [Active to the last, Carl J. Drake died October 2, 1965.]

Donald R. Davis conducted biological investigations of yucca and
agave moths, emphasizing differences in life histories, host specificity,
and other factors. His published work will be replete with illustrations
demonstrating his findings. Davis is also engaged in a study of the
New World Incurvariidae, small moths belonging to the superfamily
Tineoidea. In April 1965 he joined the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian
biological survey of Dominica for field work which will emphasize
investigations of the Tineoidea.

W. Donald Duckworth has made significant progress with his research
on the New World Stenomidae. Particularly important in this con-
nection have been the field investigations carried on in El Salvador,
Costa Rica, and Panama. These investigations have resulted in the
accumulation of much material which will contribute to our knowledge
of the ecology and zoogeography of the group. Further advances in
the research on the Stenomidae were made by his study of the extensive
collections of typical and ordinary material at the British Museum
(Natural History); also the type material from the Naturhistorisches
Museum, Vienna.

William D. Field continued his research on the butterflies of the
genera Thecla and Vanessa and initiated studies of the butterflies and
larger moths of Dominica. The latter project will include the moth
families Arctiidae, Ctenuchidae, and Sphingidae.

J. F. Gates Clarke furthered his long-term project of elucidating the
Meyrick types of Microlepidoptera. Volume 5 of this series appeared
in March 1965. The solutions to several problems and the revision of
several groups of Neotropical Microlepidoptera have been accom-
plished. The research on the moths of this area is another long-term
project greatly facilitated by a grant from the National Science Founda-
tion. Concurrently, Clarke is continuing research on the Micro-
lepidoptera of Rapa, Micronesia, and other Pacific Islands.

Oliver S. Flint, Jr., in his research on the Trichoptera (caddisflies)
of the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, has concentrated on those of
the West Indies, with the result that major papers on the Trichoptera
of Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles are nearly complete.

Research associate Thomas E. Snyder continued work on the second
supplement to his notable “Annotated, Subject-Heading Bibliography
of the Termites.”
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-ENTOMOLOGY 67

Research associate K. C. Emerson completed several projects on the
taxonomy of the Mallophaga or biting lice. In the course of his
investigations he has studied major collections of lice from birds from
Uruguay, New Guinea, the Congo, and the Pacific Ocean.

Ralph E. Crabill, Jr., is continuing several projects, mostly begun
several years ago. Among them are a monograph of the New Zealand
chilopods, a revision of the genus Strigamia, and a revision of the
Mecistocephalidae. He is also preparing several articles on the dolicho-
cephalic Geophilomorpha. Work on two projects, a monograph and
a checklist of North American Chilopoda, is suspended because of the
unavailability of certain type specimens. From May 18 to September
8, 1964, Crabill studied critical collections in London, Munich, Vienna,
Hamburg, and Frankfurt. In order to augment our material, Crabill
undertook several field trips in north, central, and southern Germany
and in the Tirol and Vorarlberg areas of Austria.

BOTANY

The vast forests, plains, tablelands, and islands of the New World
tropics are a reservoir of countless species of plants still to be understood
and described. For over 75 years botanists of the U.S. National
Herbarium have spent a large share of their research time exploring for
plants in these regions and in making them understood to the scientific
community through their publications.

This tradition of specialization in the New World tropics has con-
tinued into the present time. During the past year Lyman B. Smith
spent six months collecting plants in Santa Catarina and adjoining
States of Brazil in preparation for a flora of the former area. This
work is being pursued in collaboration with Brazilian botanists Padre
Raulino Reitz and Roberto M. Klein of the Herbario “Barbosa
Rodrigues,”’ Itajai, Santa Catarina. The grasslands of Brazil’s Mato
Grosso and other parts of the planalio were explored by Thomas R.
Soderstrom in association with his studies on the grasses of Brazil.
Soderstrom accompanied botanists of the New York Botanical Garden
and first collected plants around Brasilia, an area surprisingly unknown
botanically. Later, poorly known parts of the States of Mato Grosso
and Goids were visited, including a wide variety of habitats on the
Serra do Caiapé which support a rich and varied flora and made for
collections of excitingly different plants. Antillean plants were sampled
by Dan H. Nicolson, who spent six weeks on Dominica in conjunction
with the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian biological survey of that Carib-
bean island.

Keen interest has prompted the Smithsonian Institution to participate
actively in an international program for the preparation of a ‘Flora
Neotropica.” To this end, research associate José Cuatrecasas was
70 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

appointed by the ‘Organization for a Flora Neotropica” as one of
two scientific directors. For his work with the Organization, the Smith-
sonian has given him laboratory and office space to help him carry out
his responsibilities. Besides continuing his own investigations of New
World plants, Cuatrecasas will act as liaison officer, especially with
Latin American botanists, to stimulate research clarifying the taxonomic
complexities occurring in the Western Hemisphere tropics. Production
of a tropical flora for the New World is a Herculean undertaking
because of the great number of species, the shortage of sufficiently
trained botanists, and the still difficult access to many outlying regions.
It will be the labor of generations of botanists; the present hope is to
lay a sound foundation for the research of years to come.

A smaller, but nonetheless significant, project also begun this year
is the production of a flora for the Island of Dominica. Actually, this
island falls within the range of the ‘“‘Flora Neotropica,” of which the
information set forth will form a fragment. ‘The scientific aspects of
this venture are under the direction of Dan H. Nicolson, who is being
aided by fellow Smithsonian scientists as well as those from other
botanical institutions in the United States and abroad.

Mason E. Hale, Jr., carried his research on the cosmopolitan lichen
genus Parmelia to the Far East this past year under the auspices of the
National Science Foundation and the Government of Japan. He made
extensive general collections of lichens in Hawaii, Sabah, Sarawak, the
Philippines, and Japan; and through his work the Museum will have
the world’s most extensive Malaysian and Philippine lichen collections.
Hale was based at the National Science Museum in Tokyo for the
greater part of his studies abroad, collaborating there with Syo
Kurokawa.

As the facts accumulated by intensive study of plants become over-
powering in their numbers and increasingly more difficult to consult,
it becomes evident that means must be found for the rapid storage and
retrieval of these data so that they can conveniently be used for further
investigations. Presently, searches for data are subject to the vagaries
of abstracting and indexing journals and to human shortcomings, and
therefore a large body of pertinent data relative to current research
projects might easily be overlooked. Machine storing of data does not
automatically confer accuracy or reliability, since the system is only as
good as the confirmed data stored in it; but the data are always re-
trievable in their entirety, and automatic data processing, moreover,
provides ways objectively to manipulate facts in a manner not pre-
viously possible.

Botanists are realizing that data processing devices and computers
may be important tools in the treatment of botanical facts; thus, David
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—BOTANY 71

B. Lellinger has completed research on the generic relationships of the
fern subfamily Adiantoideae, a taxon of 45 genera. The study was
the first of its kind to use a large digital computer to apply neo-typologi-
cal methods to evolutionary classification. The computer employed
models of character-state distributions, and chose those characters which
were most probably important to an evolutionary classification of the
taxa in Adiantoideae. Machine-made computations enabled Lellinger
to construct dendrograms illustrating the most probable evolution of
the genera. Among the resultant taxonomic conclusions which he
drew were the division of the subfamily into six tribes and the segrega-
tion of several genera. ‘These separations were made on the basis of
probability, rather than intuition. The computer proved to be a val-
uable adjunct to, but not a replacement for, conventional taxonomic
methods.

In taxonomic studies it is important to consider all evidence which
may assist in elucidating problems in plant classification and evolution
and to be concerned with all parts of the plant body, with the influence
of environment, and with pertinent chemical processes. Accordingly,
it is noteworthy that Richard H. Eyde is continuing his investigations
into the anatomy and morphology of the genus Corokta which has been
allied to the Cornaceae in most taxonomic treatments. Eyde’s data,
based partially on specimens of Corokia gathered by Smithsonian ento-
mologist J. F. Gates Clarke from the remote South Pacific island of
Rapa, permit the confident exclusion of the genus from Cornaceae.

Research on the cytology and pollen morphology of Campanula ameri-
cana has been completed by Stanwyn G. Shetler. He is preparing a
paper in collaboration with James Matthews of the University of North
Carolina on the taxonomic affinities of this species within the genus
Campanula. Along a similar vein, Wallace R. Ernst began a cytotax-
onomic survey of selected West Indian plants. ‘This will be the first
study of its kind on many of these tropical plants. Although associated
studies such as those described above may never completely replace
traditional morphological taxonomic research, they provide new win-
dows through which plant systematics can be viewed, and they present
other methods of approach to taxonomic problems.

PALEOBIOLOGY

Continuing his studies of the Permian Brachiopoda of West Texas,
G. Arthur Cooper, in collaboration with Richard E. Grant of the U.S.
Geological Survey, completed a manuscript of 4000 pages. The illus-
trations are yet to be made. With J. T. Dutro of the U.S. Geological
Survey, Cooper spent a month in New Mexico completing a study of
the stratigraphy of the Devonian of that State.
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-PALEOBIOLOGY 75

Investigation of the Lower Devonian fossil flora of eastern Canada by
Francis M. Hueber is demonstrating that this is a more diversified flora
than previously anticipated. Hueber visited nine European museums
and universities to obtain data, for comparison with the Canadian flora,
from their collections of Devonian plants from classic European local-
ities. He observed a striking similarity of occurrence and composition _
between the western European and Canadian floras. His paper “New
data on the morphology of Devonian Psilopsida and Lycopsida,”’ em-
bodying much of the new information gained from his studies of the
Canadian Lower Devonian flora, was presented at the Symposium on
Earliest Records of Plant Life, during the Tenth International Botanical
Congress at Edinburgh, Scotland.

Walter H. Adey extended his studies of crustose coralline algae
northward from the Gulf of Maine'along the coasts of Nova Scotia, the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, to Newfoundland and Labrador. His northern-
most station was at latitude 60°6’N. A collection of 3010 specimens
was assembled. Preparation and examination proceeded as the col-
lecting schedule progressed during summer, and was completed during
winter and spring with the help of museum aide Mary Cochran.
Through a rare opportunity, the sexual development of a species of the
coralline Lithothamnium was recorded and worked out. Work has pro-
ceeded in plotting of the bathymetric and geographic distribution of the
crustose coralline species in the regions where collections were obtained.

C. Lewis Gazin is investigating the morphology of the Eocene con-
dylarthran mammal Hyopsodus. He completed a study of a “‘fossil
brain” of the middle Eocene primate Smilodectes, the first well-preserved
endocranial cast of a Tertiary primate reported from this country. He
also completed a study of a series of early Eocene mammalian faunas
and their environments in the vicinity of the Rock Springs uplift.

Field work last summer by Gazin and Franklin L. Pearce of the
laboratory of vertebrate paleontology yielded rare Paleocene mammals
from the Puerco and Torrejon horizons of the San Juan Basin in New
Mexico, and early Eocene and Oligocene mammals from the Wind
River Basin in central Wyoming.

David H. Dunkle continued studies of new and poorly known fossil
fishes from Middle and Upper Devonian strata of Ohio, Ontario, and
Michigan. Accompanied by museum technician Gladwyn B. Sullivan,
he made a second trip to Tijeras, Bernalillo County, N. Mex., where
in 1963 a unique assemblage of marine fishes was discovered in the
Late Paleozoic Madera Formation. There, two types of sharks, a
paleoniscoid, an osteolepid, and a probable lungfish were collected.

Nicholas Hotton III, starting in September 1963, spent a year in a
field study of the stratigraphy and environment of the Permo-Triassic
76 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Beaufort Series of South Africa, 10,000 feet thick. Preliminary study
indicates more overlap between supposedly distinct faunal zones than
hitherto suspected, and suggests that some of the lower zones may rep-
resent contemporaneous environmental facies rather than temporal
sequences.

A collection of the abundant mammal-like reptile fauna of the Beau-
fort was also made, with emphasis on the herbivorous suborder Anomo-
dontia. Knowledge of the anomodonts is vital to understanding of
Beaufort stratigraphy and paleoecology because of their abundance
and variety and because of their basic position in the food pyramid of
Permo-Triassic times.

Publication of Clayton E. Ray’s research on later Cenozoic mammals
included three papers on Antillean faunas. <A survey of fossil walruses
of the eastern states is in progress.

With museum specialist John E. Ott, Ray spent two weeks in Florida
collecting a partial skeleton of a mammoth discovered by a Boy Scout
troop. The specimen was donated to the Institution by Explorer Post
410 of Wauchula, Fla. Ray is also studying Pleistocene musk oxen
referred to him by Virginia Polytechnic Institute.

Research associate Remington Kellogg continued investigating the
developmental history of the Cetacea with special reference to the
Mysticeti. A study of a Calvert Miocene sirenian was completed.

Richard S. Boardman and research associate John Utgaard completed
a major restudy of some genera of Paleozoic Bryozoa. Their paper
includes an interpretative section on the budding of most incrusting
forms, illustrated by 3-dimensional cutaway drawings by scientific
illustrator Lawrence B. Isham. Boardman has begun an investigation
of living species of cyclostome Bryozoa considered closely related to
Paleozoic forms. Microstructure of the calcareous walls of individuals
in the colonies is being studied jointly with Kenneth M. Towe, using
the electron microscope.

In other research on Bryozoa, museum specialist Frederick J. Collier
finished a detailed taxonomic study of two Devonian genera that will
be the nucleus for a larger publication on rhomboporoid genera.

Richard H. Benson, professor of geology at the University of Kansas,
joined the staff in July 1964 to work on Recent and fossil ostracodes.
He spent his first five months in the western Indian Ocean as a member
of the scientific party on the R/V Anton Bruun. He collected thousands
of specimens off Africa and Madagascar and has begun to sort and de-
scribe them. Benson is also completing a survey of the effects of the
formation of Bering Strait on the ostracodes of the North Pacific and
Arctic Oceans.
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS——PALEOBIOLOGY AT

Martin A. Buzas completed a manuscript on a multivariate analysis
of some species of Elphidium. He is currently applying the same ca-
nonical analysis to the distribution and abundance of Foraminifera off
Texas. In addition, he has been surveying the Foraminifera in Chesa-
peake Bay as part of a preliminary sampling program which will be
followed by an ecological study of the Foraminifera in the Bay. In
cooperation with the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole,
Mass., Buzas has also been studying the distribution and abundance of
Foraminifera in Hadley Harbor, Mass.

Richard Cifelli continues his studies of planktonic Foraminifera from
the north and equatorial Atlantic in a cooperative program with the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution that includes the detailed sur-
vey and sampling of portions of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Last year
the R/V Chain surveyed around latitude 22° N., and many cores,
bottom samples, and dredges were collected from the crest and flank
of the Ridge. Several samples yielded chunks of cemented foraminif-
eral oozes associated with basalt and basaltic weathering products.
The oozes are all late Tertiary, but represent at least two and possibly
three distinct ages. From the relationships between the oozes and the
basalts, it appears that the latter were deposited during the late Miocene
or early Pliocene.

Erle G. Kauffman continues to study the Mesozoic pelecypod groups
Inoceramidae, Ostreidae, and Thyasira. A morphologic and supra-
specific taxonomic revision of the Inoceramidae and a study of the
Caribbean Cretaceous inoceramids were completed. Significant prog-
ress was made on study of the Upper Cretaceous Inoceramidae of
North America. A study of American Cretaceous Thyasira and three
studies dealing with the Ostreidae are completed or in progress. Work
was initiated on a major revision of early Upper Cretaceous stratigraphy
in Colorado and Kansas, and several local biostratigraphic studies in
Colorado and New Mexico are in progress. Kauffman was in the field
for three months’ work on Cretaceous paleontology and stratigraphy of
the Rocky Mountains, and he conducted two weeks of research in
Trinidad.

In an effort to understand the living habits of fossil echinoids, Porter
M. Kier three years ago started a study of the echinoids living off the
Florida Keys. Using scuba gear, he and Richard E. Grant of the U.S.
Geological Survey mapped the distribution of 17 species found between
the shore and a depth of 110 feet seaward of the reef. Particular atten-
tion was paid to the relationship of the echinoids to the bottom, vegeta-
tion, depth, and nearness to shore. Most species were restricted to a
78 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

narrow depth range and to a particular type of bottom. The species
living on sand were only rarely found on rock or coral.

Kenneth M. Towe, who joined the staff on October 1, 1964, is in
process of setting up a laboratory for research with the electron micro-
scope. His principal interests include calcification and shell structure,
and clay and colloid mineralogy.

Research associate Wendell P. Woodring spent two months in Central
America collecting Tertiary mollusks for a continued study of the
paleontology and stratigraphy of Panama, Costa Rica, and adjacent
areas. He is currently in the field collecting faunas from the classical
Tertiary localities of Italy and France. Research associate Franco
Rasetti completed one phase of study on a new Lower Cambrian tri-
lobite fauna from the Taconic region of New York. And research
associate Axel A. Olsson continues his studies of South American
Tertiary Mollusca.

MINERAL SCIENCES

The department of mineral sciences completed its first full year as
a separate department on October 15, 1964. Kurt Fredriksson joined
the staff in July 1964 to head the division of meteorites and to implement
a research program supported by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Later in the year Brian Mason joined the meteorite
group, and in August 1964 William G. Melson joined the staff to head
the division of petrology.

The division of meteorites now operates a modern and complete elec-
tron microprobe laboratory. Emission and x-ray fluorescence spec-
troscopy and x-ray diffraction facilities have also been added. The
optical microscopy and photographic equipment has been upgraded
and extended. The chemical laboratory has obtained modernized
equipment for sample preparation and spectrophotometry.

The electron microprobe is an instrument for nondestructive ele-
mental analysis of extremely small (~ 1 micron) particles of material
or areas. In operation, a polished sample, such as a petrographic thin
section, is bombarded with a finely focused electron beam. The
elements present in the sample then emit their characteristic x-ray
Electron probe x-ray microanalyzer in the division of mete-
orites. To the right are high-voltage and _ electron-lens
power supplies and vacuum controls. The main tank has the
electron gun (top), a microscope, sample chamber with
access door and sample stage, and three spectrometers. ‘To
the left of the operator are beam-scanning controls and display
oscilloscopes with camera. The recording unit at the left
contains detector and control-voltage supplies, strip-chart
recorders, and x-ray counting devices (scalers) connected to
the automatic typewriter (far left). The instrument was
obtained under a grant (NsG—688) from the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration for meteorite research
now in progress. (See p. 80-81.)

spectra that are analyzed with three focusing spectrometers, and the
elements determined. Quantitative analysis is obtained by comparing
the intensity of a specific spectral line emitted by the sample to a
standard of known composition. The sensitivity of the method is
usually better than 0.1 percent, and since the sample weight can be of
the order of 10°” grams, it may be possible to detect 107 grams of an
element. The electron beam can be made to sweep the area of the
sample synchronously with an oscilloscope on which the light intensity
is modified by the x-rays emitted from the sample. By means of
this technique a “map” can be obtained illustrating semiquantita-
tively the distribution of all elements heavier than lithium in areas
from about 10 x 10 to 500 x 500 microns.

The acquisition of an x-ray diffraction unit, used for identifying and
estimating abundances of different phases in meteorites, has filled a
long-time deficiency in the department’s facilities. Also acquired was
an x-ray fluorescence unit which attaches to the diffractometer. This
is used for routine survey analyses of meteorites and rocks before
deciding if more costly wet-chemical analysis is warranted. Newly
acquired emission spectrographic equipment makes it possible to
perform semiquantitative spectrographic analyses, particularly for the
first survey of an unknown sample when only a small amount, a
milligram or less, is available.

Although the new laboratory has been operating for only six months,
an intensive program of meteorite research has been pursued, the
scope and variety of which is indicated by the publications that have
ensued.

Edward P. Henderson and Brian Mason collected tektites and
meteorites in the interior of Australia for approximately six weeks.
A number of fine specimens, including one unique form, were found,
and the material is presently being studied in detail as to morphology
and material loss during the flight through the atmosphere. This
work is being carried out in cooperation with scientists from the NASA
Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif. Significant evidence for
the fall of tektites in defined “streaks”? was obtained.

Henderson’s study of hexahedrites shows that the world-wide dis-
tribution is suggestive of showers rather than individual falls.

Mason published a fundamental study of the distribution of plagi-
oclase in chondrites. ‘The presence or absence of this mineral is related
to the olivine composition and the type of pyroxene present. From
these observations it was concluded that most chondrites have under-
gone solid-state recrystallization and that the amount of plagioclase and
orthopyroxene may be a measure of the intensity of this metamorphism.

789-427 6613
82 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

With H. B. Wiik, Mason published new descriptions of four meteorites,
and he was also coauthor of a paper describing a peculiar new
mineral “‘sinoite,” silico oxynitride (Si,N,O), found in several enstatite
chondrites.

Another new mineral was described by Fredriksson and Henderson
(1965). It was first found in enstatite chondrites but is also present in
a stony-iron (Mount Egerton) and an iron meteorite (Horse Creek).
The findings indicate a close relationship between these different classes
of meteorites. Together with K. Keil of the Ames Research Center,
Fredriksson published a microprobe analysis of olivine and pyroxene
of 90 chondrites, and also a detailed study of the Murray carbonaceous
chondrite. These data, as well as the discovery of glass enclosing
metallic nickel-iron in the Chainpur chondrite by Fredriksson and
Reid, make it possible to set rather rigid boundary conditions for the
formation of chondrules and chondrites. ‘There is exceedingly strong
evidence for the supposition that chondrules are quenched droplets and
that the nickel-iron in chondrites is cogenetic with the main part of
the silicates olivine and pyroxene.

From an investigation of the mineral phases in the Orgueil carbona-
ceous meteorite and their equilibrium relations, completed by Fredriks-
son and Kurt Bostrom, University of California, San Diego, it could be
shown that the minerals in Orgueil are not in equilibrium but represent
at least three different temperature stages. ‘The last formed minerals
indicate the presence of an external source of oxidation, possibly water
dissociated by ultraviolet radiation.

E. Olsen and Fredriksson described iron phosphates from iron
meteorites. ‘Thermodynamic calculations of the system metallic iron,
iron phosphide, and iron phosphate indicate that the degree of oxida-
tion of fine octahedrites is approximately the same as in ordinary
chondrites and considerably higher than in enstatite chondrites.

Roy S. Clarke, Jr., completed analyses of two iron meteorites, Bogou
and Angelica, and one stony meteorite, Harleton. Eugene Jarosewich
analyzed the Bonita Springs chondrite and is working on two of the
unequilibrated chondrites, Semarkona and Sharps. An investigation
of the distribution of gallium and germanium in iron meteorites and
stony-irons is in progress. Tektite studies, particularly relating to the
Martha’s Vineyard and Georgia tektites, are continuing. Clarke is
working on this project cooperatively with colleagues at the Corning
Glass Works and the U.S. Geological Survey. He also continues
cooperative work with Rutherford J. Gettens of the Freer Gallery on
iron-oxide corrosion products associated with antique bronze objects.

Paul Ramdohr, professor emeritus, University of Heidelberg, and
temporarily on the staff of the Geophysical Laboratory, made micro-
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-MINERAL SCIENCES 83

scopical investigations of a large number of polished sections of
meteorites.

In the division of mineralogy, George S. Switzer worked on a group
of rare ammonium-sulfate minerals, and on a description of one of these,
letovicite, from the Geysers, Sonoma County, Calif. He found that
published composition of letovicite is given correctly as (NH,)3H(SO,).,
but that the crystallographic data for letovicite given in standard
reference works are for the artificial compound NH,HSO,, not known
as a mineral. Work on this poorly described group of minerals is
continuing.

In spring of 1965 Switzer spent several weeks in South Africa visiting
diamond mines. Of particular interest were the “pipe”? mines where
diamonds are found in their original matrix of the ultramafic rock
kimberlite. Collections were made of kimberlite from several mines in
the Republic of South Africa and in Tanzania, and of the eclogite
inclusions in these pipes. A detailed mineralogical study of these
collections has been started, an extension of work done some time ago
on similar rocks occurring in California. A closely related long-range
study underway is the composition of garnet from rocks of all types,
and in particular from eclogite, as a first phase of the study.

Paul E. Desautels continued work on a suite of radioactive minerals
from a new occurrence in Mexico. John S. White, Jr., continued work
on a first description of the crystallography of natural crystals of platt-
nerite. During the year Desautels and White spent two weeks in
Oaxaca, Mexico, examining an area of pegmatites containing an in-
teresting suite of minerals, including scapolite crystals of very large
(up to two feet) size.

The origin of the ocean basins is a subject of speculation largely
because very little is known concerning the rocks which compose them.
The geologic contrast between the igneous and metamorphic rocks of
the continents and ocean basins is only poorly known. Rocks obtained
during recent deep-sea dredgings have demonstrated particularly that
important modifications are required in current theories about the
origin of the ocean basins and about processes of rock formation be-
neath the sea floor.

During the past year in the division of petrology W. G. Melson began
a cooperative study with Vaughan T. Bowen and Tjeerd van Andel of
the Woods Hole and Scripps Oceanographic Institutions, respectively,
concerning rocks from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This study, which
began when Melson visited Woods Hole in March, resulted in the
discovery of metabasalts in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Such rocks may
require modification of existing theories about the origin of the Ridge.
84 | SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

The study of these rocks, nearly completed during the pastyear, is
scheduled for completion before December 1965.

In conjunction with Bowen, Melson began a second study, con-
cerning a large group of ultramafic rocks collected from St. Pauls
Rocks and from the surrounding sea floor. St. Pauls Rocks, situated
on the central portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, is believed by
many petrologists to be an upthrusted portion of the earth’s mantle
and is thus particularly worthy of a detailed petrologic study. This
study to date has resulted in electron microprobe analyses of an amphi-
bole which has a composition approximating basalts, and is of interest
in connection with the origin of basalts. A preliminary publication on
this amphibole and associated rocks should be completed by the end
of 1965.

Melson has manuscripts in press on phase equilibria in calc-silicate
hornfels, Lewis and Clark County, Mont., and on plagioclase-spinel-
eraphite zenoliths in metallic iron-bearing basalts, Disko Island,
Greenland, and he has completed a manuscript on the geology and
mineral deposits of the Lincoln area, Lewis and Clark County, Mont.
Additional field and laboratory studies of the latter topic are planned.
He also began a long-term study of the igneous and metamorphic rocks
of west central Montana.

Short-term studies begun during the past year include: (1) high-
magnesium chlorites, Natural Bridge, N.Y. (cooperatively with Mar-
garet Foster of the U.S. Geological Survey); (2) corundum-bearing
gneisses, Montana (cooperatively with George S. Switzer); (3) pumice
from the South Pacific Ocean (with George E. Watson of the division
of birds); and (4) magnetic particles from the Red Sea floor (with
Sidney Knott, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and
Charles Fiori).

ANTHROPOLOGY

Physical renovation of office and storage space in the Office of Anthro-
pology, and the administrative reorganization of the Office, have both
necessitated and made possible extensive rearrangements and improve-
ments in storage facilities and in procedures for processing, accessioning,
and cataloging new specimens. The 5000 drawers of skeletal material
were placed in an alphabetical arrangement of states and foreign
countries, with a special placing of the Huntington collection of early
20th-century Americans (largely born abroad). This work was skill-
fully supervised by Donald Ortner. The African collections were
placed in a systematic, geographical arrangement, and within each
major area many objects formerly arranged by type were rearranged
by tribe. The Old World archeological collections were rearranged.
And the Smithsonian’s sizable collection of Japanese ceramics was
classified according to geographic regions and to the kilns of Japan.
Objects resulting from acculturation, whether made for export or for
sophisticated local use, were placed apart from the traditional specimens.
Rearrangement and reidentification of the Japanese ceramics were
greatly facilitated by the assistance of Mr. and Mrs. Victor Hauge.

The American Foundation for the Study of Man has loaned the
Museum all its archeological material from southern Arabia, the
finest and largest such collection in the world, and except for selected
specimens to be used in the new hall of Old World archeology, this will
be maintained as a separate study collection.

THE COLLECTIONS—CARE AND CONSERVATION 87

All the paintings that were made by Europeans or other non-native
artists and that were in the former division of ethnology have been
transferred on a long-term loan to the National Collection of Fine Arts.
This includes, particularly, the extensive series of Indian paintings by
George Catlin and the excellent facsimiles of the paintings of John
White.

The archives formerly part of the Bureau of American Ethnology
are now a part of the Office of Anthropology and continue to serve
anthropologists and other scholars throughout the world. Several
extensive collections of photographs were cataloged, particularly
covering the years from 1890 to the early 1900’s and mainly recording
details from tribes of the Plains and Southwest, but also including the
Maya and Seminole.

Most significant were the creation of a single processing laboratory for
archeological and ethnological materials, and the institution of im-
proved procedures for handling incoming collections and the constant
outgo of materials for loans, identifications, and study by visitors.
Management of the six Museum aides, technicians, and specialists
engaged in this work is a responsibility of Clifford Evans.

A. Joseph Andrews continued his repair, restoration, and casting
work with the limited facilities thus far available for the conservation
laboratory. Among the items handled were two elaborately painted
wooden doors from India; a marimba from Guatemala; pottery from
China, Egypt, Libya, Brazil, and the Pima, Acoma, and Zuni Indians;
and a Sioux tobacco pipe.

The illustrating staff, consisting of Edward G. Schumacher, aided
part-time by G. Robert Lewis and Marcia Bakry, prepared for the
publications of the research staff a large number of scientific drawings
and maps.

VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

The end of the year saw all divisions of the department, except
fishes, in new quarters and the reorganization of their collection man-
agement and research facilities in process or completed.

To improve management of the fish collections, the ledger-type
catalog books were replaced by a 3- by 5-inch card file. This new
system provides complete data in the jar with each cataloged lot;
it automatically provides duplicate cards for cross-reference purposes,
and it is adaptable to automatic recorders and to data processing
systems.

Since color discrimination is important in systematic research on
birds, the problem of supplying reproducible light conditions has been
88 | SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

solved by the installation of banks of new Examolite fixtures over the
five permanent work surfaces in the bird range. These generate a
light spectrum very near that of natural sunlight.

INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

The long-awaited move of the marine-invertebrate collections to
new quarters in the west wing was made in March and April of this
year. Its accomplishment in somewhat less than four weeks was made
possible only by the complete cooperation of all staff members, and
especially by the coordination of all aspects of the move by museum
specialist Henry B. Roberts, who devoted much of the year to the
manifold details necessary for the transfer of over 450,000 bottles of
specimens and their rearrangement in the process of transfer.

Normal curatorial activities continued, nonetheless. Marian H.
Pettibone arranged for the acquisition of the Berkeley collection of
Polychaeta, traveling to Nanimo, British Columbia, to supervise
its labelling and packing. David L. Pawson, having assessed the
requirements of the echinoderm collection, instituted an international
exchange program with 30 institutions in more than 20 countries to
broaden the scope of the collection and enhance its value as a reference
tool. And Joseph Rosewater completed an index to the uncataloged
collections of mollusks, which include over 1100 miscellaneous acces-
sions; these specimens, only generally available previously, are now
more readily accessible and may be incorporated into the general
collection more rapidly.

ENTOMOLOGY

Under grants from the National Science Foundation more than 10,000
water beetles and 14,133 specimens of Ataenius have been prepared for
critical study. The transfer of Hemiptera collections into the unit
tray system was completed this year. Carl J. Drake continued to
improve the Drake collection so that now the combined Museum and
Drake material contain more than 80 percent (1491) of the 1820 species
of the family Tingidae (lacebugs). Research associate Carl F. W.
Muesebeck and members of the Department of Agriculture staff have
added to the collection of Hymenoptera large deposits of specimens
from biological studies. Approximately 20,000 newly acquired
specimens of Lepidoptera were prepared and sorted by Mrs. Joan
M. Ledbetter, and approximately 2500 North American chrysaugine
moths were consolidated and reorganized by summer intern E. D.
Cashatt. The New World Glyphipterygidae were reclassified and
THE COLLECTIONS—-CARE AND CONSERVATION 89

properly arranged as was much of the large collection of Brassolidae.
Approximately 3000 newly acquired Microlepidoptera were prepared
for critical examination.

An important achievement concerns the enormous F. C. Bishopp col-
lection of ticks, of which, when it was received, practically all of the
specimens were dried out. During the past year Mrs. Sophie G.
Lutterlough restored 35,000 specimens by treating them with trisodium-
phosphate solution and then reintroducing them into alcohol. The
gradual introduction of trisodium-phosphate solution into the vials of
dried specimens by means of a large syringe avoids disturbing the
specimens and thus prevents damage. Ralph E. Crabill and Mrs.
Lutterlough have restored, relabeled, and rehoused 3000 myriapods
and arachnids, among which 40 unsuspected type specimens were
found. In addition, 1118 microscope slides were cleaned and sorted,
and 14,600 specimens from the Hopkins collection were treated.

PALEOBIOLOGY

Because of increased need for space, the division of paleobotany
was assigned to new quarters in the recently completed west wing of
the Natural History Museum. For the first time, the entire paleobo-
tanical collections of the Museum and those of the U.S. Geological
Survey housed in the Museum are located in a single area. The collec-
tions are arranged in order of stratigraphic occurrence and further
arranged alphabetically by State under each age category. Foreign
collections are maintained as a separate unit categorized first by strati-
graphic occurrence and then alphabetically by country. The type
collections are housed separately. The work of segregating specimens
and preparing a type-specimen catalog by museum specialist James P.
Ferrigno has been interrupted by the move.

Museum specialist Louis R. Purnell completed a card file of type
specimens in the Paleozoic ammonite collection of invertebrate paleon-
tology. Three major-type collections have now been fully curated and
manuscript lists prepared for the publication of a series of catalogs of
type specimens which will supersede the 1905 catalog in part.

Research associate Remington Kellogg undertook a major reorgani-
zation of the extensive study collections of fossil marine mammals.
This involved identification and the completing or furnishing of catalog
data. The segments of the national collection of fossil fish, involving
the scales, otoliths, agnathans, acanthodians, and placoderms were
trimmed, cleaned, completely reorganized in storage, and their docu-
mentation revised by David H. Dunkle with the aid of summer intern
James McKenney.

ANTHROPOLOGY

To the physical-anthropology collections were added a series of 24
skeletons from Buena Vista, Ecuador, excavated by Emilio Estrada.

In connection with the preparation of new African ethnological
exhibits, a collection of 69 items from Libya and a collection of ten
specimens from Zambia were secured.
THE COLLECTIONS—GIFTS AND ADDITIONS 91

Among the outstanding ethnological Asian materials received and
accessioned are the Tokyo National Museum collection, with 54 speci-
mens including rural tools and basketry; the Government of the Ryukyu
Islands collection, with 71 items emphasizing the wide range existing in
traditional textile production; the Beue Tann collection, with 49
objects related to Chinese calligraphy; 16 exceptional examples of
Japanese folk art, from Mr. and Mrs. Victor Hauge; 23 Nepalese
carvings, from Paul Rose; and 37 Jewish ritual objects made by well-
known Israeli craftsmen, from Dr. and Mrs. Abraham Kanof.

The large series of Paleo-Indian artifacts from the Lindenmeier Site
in Colorado, excavated by Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., from 1935 through
1940, was the most important archeological material accessioned. In
addition, a large collection of potsherds was received from the Uni-
versity of Tokyo Andes Expedition, through the courtesy of its director,
Professor Seiichi Izumi; type specimens are included for the entire
range of formative period materials from the site of Kotosh in the
Department of Huanuco, Peru. Archeological accessions included a
large collection from the Brooks Range, Alaska, covering the time span
from the earlier human occupations to the modern Eskimo, excavated
by research associate John M. Campbell. An important collection
from the Hostermann Site in South Dakota was also received by trans-
fer from the River Basin Surveys.

VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Fishes totaling about 15,000 specimens were received from three
critical geographic areas: Victor G. Springer collected nearly 10,000
specimens of the inshore marine fish fauna of Dominica during October
and November 1964 as a participant of the Bredin-Archbold-Smith-
sonian biological survey of Dominica. These will be especially useful in
monographic studies of western Atlantic fishes, for no comparable
collections have been made in this area. Several thousand well-
preserved fishes from islands of Oceania were received from the Smith-
sonian Institution Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program. Rich in
representative species of the tropical, inshore reef habitat, they fill
many geographic gaps from which few or no specimens are in the
national collections.

From the exploratory fisheries research activities of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, several thousand specimens of pelagic and deep
sea fishes were received. Taken mainly from the Caribbean area, these
represent some of the best scientific collections ever obtained in the
region. Collections in the Western Atlantic, resulting from the Fish
92 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

and Wildlife Service Exploratory Program, have contributed impor-
tantly to the great success of the Sears Foundation for Marine Research
monographic studies of the fishes of the western North Atlantic.

Three major collections from the New World tropics came as gifts to
the collection of reptiles and amphibians from Wilmot A. Thornton,
Albert Schwartz, and C. J. Marinkelle. An important collection of
amphibians from East Africa was given by Margaret Stewart. And 587
specimens of reptiles and amphibians were collected in Iran for the
Museum by Robert G. Tuck and John Neal of the division of mammals.

Birds accessioned this year include important new material from
little-known regions. The first major collection in the United States of
specimens from Socotra and Abd-el-Kuri in the northern Indian
Ocean was obtained by an expedition carried out by Alex Forbes-
Watson. An important collection of oceanic birds from islands in the
Central Pacific, obtained by the Smithsonian Pacific Ocean Biological
Survey Program, documents many new distribution and nesting
records. Some of the islands visited during the field work had never
before been surveyed for birds. Three collections of Latin American
birds totaling over 2000 skins and almost. 400 anatomical specimens
were accessioned during the year. These include specimens collected
in Dominica by Richard L. Zusi, in Brazil by Philip S. Humphrey, and
in Panama by Alexander Wetmore, whose years of field work there have
brought the Museum an unparalleled collection of Panamanian birds.
By transfer from the Fish and Wildlife Service 1033 skins and 111
skeletons of North American birds were received.

In 1965 over 8000 specimens of mammals were accessioned. The
largest increment came from Africa and the Middle East through the
efforts of Henry W. Setzer. Particularly noteworthy were 5700
mammals from South Africa, Mozambique, and Iran, collected on
grants from the Department of the Army; 1228 mammals from Pakistan
collected by Robert Traub and the Department of Microbiology,
University of Maryland; and a superb collection of 542 bats from
Kenya, presented by Russel E. Mumford.

A number of important accessions were of mammals from tropical
America: 185 bats from northeastern Brazil, collected by Philip S.
Humphrey and R. E. Shope; 185 mammals from the interior of
British Guiana, obtained from Stanley E. Brock; Colombian bats from
José Borrero and C. J. Marinkelle; 436 Panamanian mammals,
mostly from Isla Cébaco, collected by E. L. Tyson on a National
Science Foundation grant; and 218 Nicaraguan mammals from the
University of Pennsylvania, through L. G. Clark.
THE COLLECTIONS—GIFTS AND ADDITIONS 93

A number of individual specimens of unusual interest was received:
a skull and complete skeleton of the rare Pacific right whale from the
Whales Research Institute, Tokyo, through the generosity of its
Director, Hideo Omura; a frozen specimen of the rare Ross seal from
the National Science Foundation, Office of Antarctic Programs; a
frozen head of a pigmy sperm whale from Marineland Research
Laboratory; and a skull of the rare rough-toothed porpoise Steno breda-
nensis, from the University of Florida. The trend toward deposit of
types in the National Museum continues; holotypes of the new sub-
species of mink Mustela vision and of the bat Chiroderma salvini were
contributed by the Alaska Department of Game and Fish and the
University of Arizona, respectively.

INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Perhaps the largest and most significant addition to the invertebrate
zoology collections this year was the more than 10,000 specimens of
Polychaeta collected by Edith and Cyril Berkeley of the Pacific Bio-
logical Laboratory at Nanaimo, British Columbia. This collection
represents the accumulation of over 40 years of work, most of it having
been the subject of study and scientific publication by this team. The
significance and content of the collection have been described by
Marian H. Pettibone in a paper soon to be published. The deposition
in the Museum of an important collection such as this assures its per-
manent availability to students.

By exchange, 212 specimens of isopods were obtained from the
Zoological Institute, Leningrad, U.S.S.R.; and 500 specimens of mol-
lusks, from Tonga and the subantarctic islands of New Zealand, were
obtained from the Dominion Museum, Wellington, New Zealand.
Purchased through the Chamberlain fund were 3290 marine shells
from North Borneo, collected by Mrs. Mary Saul, and 610 from Muscat,
Oman, by Donald T. Bosch.

Colleagues in other institutions and universities often deposit their
study collections in the national collections when their researches are
complete. In this manner 2354 specimens of copepods collected by
Arthur Humes of Boston University were donated to the Museum.
They were obtained during Humes’ researches at Nosy Bé, Malagasy
Republic, as a part of the Indian Ocean Expedition.

ENTOMOLOGY

The largest, and perhaps most outstanding, contribution made to
the entomological collections this year, that obtained in the western
94 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

Mexican states by Paul Spangler and his family, consisted of 50,850
specimens, of which 32,000 were water beetles. Spangler also donated
7000 specimens from his personal collection. J. F. Gates Clarke and
his wife contributed 11,674 specimens from the remote island of Rapa,
obtained with the aid of a grant from the Office of Naval Research, and
2622 specimens from Arkansas. Ronald W. Hodges presented 3000
Coleoptera through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Oliver S.
Flint contributed 2062 beetles from the West Indies, and 2000 beetles
of the subfamily Aphodiinae were obtained from Argentina.

To the Hemiptera collections were added 5000 specimens from George
F. Knowlton, 1169 specimens from George E. Bohart, and 651 speci-
mens from Oliver S. Flint, Jr. To the Lepidoptera collections were
added a notable number of small but important contributions, con-
spicuous among which were the more than 3900 specimens collected
in the Malagasy Republic by E. D. Cashatt and K. I. Lange; 791
butterflies from Greece collected by J. G. Coutsis; 1300 New Zealand
moths contributed by T. H. Davies;,632 Hydrelia flies from D. L. Donier
and J. L. Laffoon; 5000 specimens collected in Florida by Ronald W.
Hodges; 495 European flies from D. L. Knutson; 890 Alaskan flies
from K. M. Sommerman; and 2336 flies collected by George C.
Steyskal, primarily in Egypt and North America.

Donald R. Davis contributed over 5000 specimens from Arizona and
New Mexico; W. Donald Duckworth and his wife obtained 10,125
moths and flies from Panama; Oliver S. Flint, Jr., contributed 1887
Lepidoptera and Diptera from the West Indies and the United States;
and Waldo L. Schmitt presented 458 flies collected by him in Antarctica
and New Zealand.

Particularly important additions to the collection of biting and sucking
lice were made by K. C. Emerson who deposited 1160 slides, including
33 holotypes, of these insects. In addition, he was responsible for the
transfer of 919 slides of these important ectoparasites from the Depart-
ment of the Army. Ralph E. Crabill, Jr., presented 402 European
myriapods, almost all the species of which were previously unrepre-
sented in the collections. Yu Hsi Moltze Wang presented 107 identi-
fied Formosan myriapods, none previously represented in the col-
lections. Waldo L. Schmitt presented 2383 mites from New Zealand
and Antarctica, noteworthy because of the paucity of material in the
collections from this part of the world.

BOTANY

Noteworthy among the wide diversity of botanical research materials
from various areas of the globe added to the collections was a group
THE COLLECTIONS—GIFTS AND ADDITIONS 95

of 1330 herbarium specimens of flowering plants received by exchange
through the Botanical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the
U.S.S.R. A group of 1250 microscope slides of cleared strobili of
Selaginella was received as a gift from Northwestern University. These
slides document published research of Howard J. Arnott and Harry T.
Horner, based largely on collections in the National Herbarium, on the
disposition of mega- and microspores in this genus. The historically
valuable diatom collection of M. L. Walsh, received as a gift from Mrs.
Walsh of Baltimore, included 920 microscope slides, 350 samples of
diatomaceous earth, and 385 bottles of liquid-preserved diatom-
bearing materials. These represent careful collections from almost
all the known diatom deposits in southern Maryland, many of which
have now been exhausted or otherwise obliterated. Conrad V.
Morton added 2595 photographs of fern types prepared in European
herbaria. A collection of 150 ferns constituting three series of ‘‘Filices
Japonicae Exsiccatae,” prepared by M. Tagawa and K. Iwatsuki, was
accessioned. ‘These specimens contain isotypes of several new fern
species. Two collections of African grasses were added to the grass
herbarium: 385 specimens of Digitaria gathered by A. J. Oakes in West
Africa, and a miscellaneous assortment from R. R. Martenson, a mis-
sionary in Northern Cameroun. A large set of Mexican grasses was
accessioned through A. Robinson of Kansas Wesleyan University, who
identified them during a visit to the National Herbarium. Three
groups of wood specimens were accessioned from Southeast Asia: a
small but rare set from Cambodia, received on exchange from the
French Centre Technique Forestier Tropical; 120 specimens from
Thailand, donated by Robert M. King; and 220 woods from the
Philippines, from William L. Stern. The latter two accessions com-
prise excellent research materials, since the identifications of all speci-
mens are corroborated by herbarium vouchers. Other important
accessions included 330 specimens of European mosses received on
exchange from the University of Helsinki and 635 lichen specimens
from southeastern United States, collected by Mason E. Hale, Jr.

PALEOBIOLOGY

Among the specimens accessioned by the division of paleobotany,
those of major importance include the 142 type or figured specimens
received as gifts, of which a few examples are: the Goucher collection
of cycadeoid trunk sections, representing the finest collection of de-
scribed specimens from the Lower Cretaceous of Maryland, from
Goucher College; the earliest described specimen of an American
cycadeoid, from Johns Hopkins University; and, among the microfossils,
96 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

12 holotypes of Maestrichtian and Danian calcareous nannoplankton
from Alabama, Arkansas, France, and Denmark, from M. N. Bramlette
and E. Martini. From the Walcott fund was purchased 1000 pounds
of selected Rhynie chert. This quantity of material constitutes the
largest single collection in the United States of this classic Middle
Devonian plant-bearing material. From the Roland W. Brown fund
was purchased an excellent exhibit specimen of the Lower Cretaceous
cycadeoid Cycadeoidea marylandica, found near Laurel, Md. Also pur-
chased was a collection of fossil plants from the Eocene of Bolca, Italy.
Exchange with the Paleobotaniska Avdelning, Naturhistoriska Riks-
museets in Stockholm, Sweden, brought in 89 specimens of Chinese
Permo-Carboniferous plants and 44 Swedish Rhaeto-Liassic plants.

A collection of amphibians and therapsid reptiles from the Permo-
Triassic of the Karoo region in South Africa, outstanding in being
probably the best documented Beaufort collection to date, was made
by Nicholas Hotton under a grant from the National Science Founda-
tion and with the help of J. W. Kitching of the Bernard Price Institute
in Johannesburg. It includes about 312 specimens consisting of skulls,
partial and complete skeletons, and identifiable fragments, and is
particularly strong in the herbivorous anomodonts. A collection of
about 550 specimens of early mammals was made by GC. L. Gazin,
assisted by Franklin L. Pearce, under a grant from the National Science
Foundation. The greater part, about 320 specimens, consisted of jaws
and maxillae of a variety of rare Paleocene mammals from Puerco and
Torrejon horizons of the Nacimiento formation in New Mexico. The
remaining portion of the collection was obtained principally from the
Lysite early Eocene and Chadronian Oligocene of the Wind River
Basin, Wyo., greatly increasing our representation of the smaller
mammals of these horizons.

David H. Dunkle, assisted by Gladwyn B. Sullivan, during the latter
part of the summer season made a collection of about 115 specimens
of vertebrate and invertebrate animals under support from the Walcott
fund. Of these specimens, 81 were fossil fish secured from a clay pit
in the upper Madera formation near Tijeras, N. Mex. Particular
mention may be made of unusually complete skeletons of acanthodian
and a variety of palaeoniscoid fishes, as well as the fragmentary remains
of several sharks and a caelacanthine.

An outstanding addition to the invertebrate-paleontology collections
was made possible by the Walcott fund: during the winter of 1963-64,
Richard E. Grant, of the U.S. Geological Survey, accompanied by
Ali N. Fatmi, of the Geological Survey of Pakistan, made an extensive
collection of Permian fossils from the Productus Limestone of the Salt,
Khisor, and Surghar Ranges of West Pakistan; these consist of an

estimated 35,000 specimens and an additional undetermined number
that will be freed from limestone blocks by dissolution in hydrochloric
acid. This collection, which is to be shared by the Geological Survey
of Pakistan, will provide a basis for direct comparison of American
Permian specimens with those from the best known Permian sequence
in Asia, since the Productus Limestone of the Salt Range is a standard
for reference and correlation of Permian rocks of all parts of the world,
and its fauna must be considered in connection with Permian studies
everywhere. The Pakistan collection, a valuable addition to the
national collections under any circumstances, is especially valuable
in view of the extensive program of Permian studies now under way.

The Walcott fund also supported field work which resulted in several
other important additions to the collections, each of several thousand
specimens. These include Devonian invertebrates from southern
New Mexico, collected by G. Arthur Cooper and J. T. Dutro; Ordo-
vician Bryozoa from measured sections and type localities in north-
eastern New York, by Richard S. Boardman and Olgerts Karklins;
and invertebrates from the Middle Ordovician at Paquette Rapids,
Ont., by Ellis Yochelson.

MINERAL SCIENCES

To the collections were added 11 meteorites not previously repre-
sented, as well as 2066 grams of tektites received from the Ames
Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

A major effort is being made to acquire for the petrographic reference
collections specimens of rocks that have been described and chemically
analyzed. About 100 such rocks were acquired during the year, most
of them by transfer from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Of the many important additions to the mineralogy collections,
three were of outstanding importance: Harry Winston, Inc., presented
to the Smithsonian in memory of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, former
Chairman of the Board of De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd., a
magnificent gem-quality diamond crystal weighing 253.7 carats,
from the Dutoitspan Mine, Republic of South Africa; John B. Jago
of San Francisco donated his collection of minerals, numbering nearly
4000 specimens and generally considered to be the finest contemporary
private collection in the United States; and Mr. and Mrs. Lennart
Erickson of Palo Alto, Calif., donated three outstanding gems: a 117-
carat emerald cabochon brooch, a 126-carat aquamarine, and a 50.5-
carat rubellite tourmaline.

Exhibits

ANTHROPOLOGY

An exhibit of Dead Sea Scrolls from Jordan was shown in the foyer
gallery of the Museum of Natural History from February 27 through
March 21. Negotiations for loan of the specimens and accompanying
photographs, conducted by Gus W. Van Beek and the Department of
State, had been in progress since 1960 with the Government of Jor-
dan, which generously loaned the material for the Smithsonian ex-
hibit. One of the most popular ever presented in the Museum,
the exhibit was kept open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings;
and during its 22 days 209,643 persons were recorded as visiting it.
The exhibition provided a synopsis of the story of the Dead Sea Scrolls
in four sections: first, the discovery; second, the Essenes, the people
of the Scrolls, and their community; third, the Scrolls themselves and
their significance for historical and religious studies; and fourth, the
techniques of Scroll research and publication. Van Beek was assisted
in preparation of the exhibit by a number of internationally known
scholars and by Rolland O. Hower, of the Smithsonian’s exhibit
staff, who was chief designer. The imaginative and effective arrange-
ment, created for temporary traveling display, will eventually ac-
company the material back to Jordan, where it will become part of the
permanent Palestine archeological exhibits. The material was sched-
uled for display in Philadelphia, Berkeley, Claremont, Omaha, and
Baltimore, and will then go to Canada and England before its return
to Jordan. This exhibit is an outstanding example of how much
can be done to associate the meaning and significance of a group of
objects with the objects themselves, stressing ideas in the exhibit
rather than merely presenting specimens.

Substantial progress was made in the African hall, in the hall of
physical anthropology, and in the hall of Old World archeology.
In the preparation of African materials, it was fortunately possible
to undertake extensive restoration, cleaning, and repair of important
specimens—some of them old and unique. A special crew, under
contract, in the course of the year treated 288 separate items, of which
the largest number were spears and swords and among the most
important were wood carvings and masks, some of them among the
oldest surviving from parts of Africa. They similarly treated over 100
specimens for exhibit in the hall of Old World archeology.

A significant achievement was made by the plastics laboratory of the
Office of Exhibits in the making of new casts of important works of

98
EXHIBITS 99

sculpture. Previously such casts have been made of plaster, and re-
sulted in heavy, fragile specimens requiring considerable maintenance,
including frequent repainting. Under the supervision of John C.
Widener, old plaster casts are now being replaced with casts made of
plastic. This involves cleaning and repairing the plaster cast, making
a rubber mold of it, and then casting a reinforced, colored plastic
duplicate. These new duplicates are light in weight, strong, and resis-
tant to damage; they have the color built in and can be maintained
by an occasional washing with detergent and water. A number of
monochrome plastic casts have been made of reliefs from Zinjirli,
Persepolis, and Nineveh. Much more ambitious was the copying in
plastic of a large Egyptian red-granite lion, utilizing techniques devel-
oped by Walter G. Sorrell. Using a fragment of Egyptian red granite
as a guide, he made thin sheets of plastic reproducing the colors of the
different crystals in the granite. These sheets were then broken into
chips of various sizes, distributed over the surface of the mold, and a
pink plastic matrix poured over them. The result is a magnificent
cast which so nearly approximates the original stone that a fragment of
the red granite placed against the plastic cast becomes lost in its back-
ground. These techniques hold considerable promise for newer
museums that are no longer able to acquire original sculptures from
abroad.

Work continued on the preparation and installation of the remaining
few exhibits in the Asian hall, and collections already in the Museum
were augmented with eight contemporary objects donated by Dr. and
Mrs. Abram Kanof through the Jewish Museum in New York, and
three specimens given by the Embassy of Israel.

Installation of the Hall of Physical Anthropology approached its
final stages with sections on man as a primate, on human biological
variation, on pathology, and on the populations of the world, being
produced. The section of exhibits on fossil man and a panel on mech-
anisms of evolution are the only portions remaining for future prepara-
tion. The world map showing body-build silhouettes of various popu-
lations and accurate face masks of individuals from all parts of the world,
has turned out to be particularly impressive and informative.

On May 25, 1965, fire caused by a faulty electrical circuit gutted
two cases in the Indian hall, one exhibiting Zuni and Hopi kachina
figures, some of them collected as early as 1870 by such early explorers
and scholars as Burke, Powell, Wheeler, Palmer, Cushing, and Steven-
son, and the other, objects from the Spanish Mission period of the
southwestern United States, illustrating the transition from Indian
religious concepts to Catholicism. Nearly all of the objects in these
100 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

two exhibits were a total loss, although a few of the kachina figures can
still be used for scientific study though not for exhibition. An ad-
joining case illustrating the life of the Cocopa Indians was somewhat
damaged by water and flames, but all of the material was saved.

VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

A model of a giant-sized black marlin, Makaira indica, captured by
the donor, Alfred C. Glassell, Jr., provided a spectacular addition
to the hall of life in the sea. ‘The marlin, a world record for rod and reel,
was captured off Cabo Blanco, Peru, and measured 14}, feet in length
and weighed 1560 pounds.

Members of the curatorial staff participated in the planning and de-
sign of the hall of osteology, which opened during the year, and the
hall of cold-blooded vertebrates. ‘The latter is in process of construc-
tion, and considerable progress has been made in obtaining material
for the topical and habitat cases.

The freeze-dry method of preserving reptiles continues to be highly
satisfactory and efficient. Freeze-drying of amphibians often brings a
whitish wax to the surface, which is easily painted out by a thin coat of
oil paint.

On the basis of his experience in Chile and Antarctica last year,
George E. Watson provided scripts for three cases in the temporary
exhibition “Image of Chile,” on display in fall of 1964.

INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Work on the hall of life in the sea progressed slowly throughout the
year, with no additional exhibits opened. For alcove cases depicting
reproduction and parental care, many models have been completed
and work on others begun under the direction of Charles E. Cutress,
Thomas E. Bowman, and David L. Pawson. In these exhibits an
attempt is being made to show, by enlarged models, some of the many
fascinating ways and devices by which marine invertebrates repro-
duce their kind and provide protection for their eggs and young.
Methods of reproduction, ranging from simple asexual splitting to the
complex courtship behavior associated with sexual reproduction in a
fiddler crab, and examples displaying parental care have been selected
from as wide a range of animals as possible, so that these cases will also
serve to illustrate the great diversity of form and structure in inverte-
brate animals.

With the assistance of summer intern Durbin Dixon, coral specimens
were produced for inclusion in the coral-reef life group, but significant
EXHIBITS 101

progress on this exhibit awaits construction of viewing ports and
supporting steel work.

Accompanied by Kjell B. Sandved, Cutress collected selected in-
vertebrates and took over 1200 color photographs of living animals in
Puerto Rico during August and September 1964. These, together
with detailed notes, will form the basis for the construction of the models
required for adequate representation of many of the minute and deli-
cate invertebrate forms. Among the many specimens photographed
was the large Caribbean feather-duster worm Sabellastarte magnifica,
selected to represent a polychaete annelid and a particular feeding
mechanism. A model maker will construct with plastics and waxes an
enlarged representation of this organism, working from the preserved
specimens, notes, and photographs. Cutress continued to supervise
the construction of models, for which data were obtained during a
similar trip to the Hawaiian Islands in the previous year.

PALEOBIOLOGY

Clayton E. Ray was heavily occupied in developing plans for the
hall of Quaternary vertebrates in collaboration with designer Lucius
E. Lomax, of the Office of Exhibits. The laboratory of vertebrate
paleontology made progress in mounting skeletons for exhibition in
this hall of a Rancho La Brea group that includes the sabre-tooth cat
Smilodon californicus, the ground sloth Paramylodon harlani, and the horse
Equus occidentalis. Restoration has been completed preparatory to
mounting the 4-horned antelope Stockoceros onusrosagrus from the
Pleistocene of Arizona, received in an exchange from the Frick Lab-
oratories at the American Museum in New York. Much progress also
has been made in restoring the two giant ground sloths Eremotherium
rusconit, secured by C. Lewis Gazin from the Pleistocene of Panama,
which are to serve as the central display in the hall.

MINERAL SCIENCES

Construction was completed for new physical geology, meteorite,
and jade exhibits, and for a major enlargement and revision of the
gem exhibit. Paul E. Desautels wrote scripts for all the gem exhibit
cases, the design was completed by Mrs. Dorothy Guthrie, and rein-
stallation begun. When the gem exhibit was closed for revision in
January 1965, a temporary exhibit was set up in the adjacent mineral
hall. Edward P. Henderson and William G. Melson began writing
scripts for the meteorite and physical geology exhibits, and the design
and production of these will be started as soon as the gem and jade
rooms are completed and reopened to the public in summer 1965,

Joun C. Ewers, Director

The Museum Historian as Scholar

The academic historian relies upon the printed page and the written
document for his primary source materials in reconstructing and
interpreting history. The resourceful museum historian, however, is
not limited to verbal sources. He knows that history is written in
objects as well as in words. He seeks to recover the sights and sounds
as well as the descriptions of history. In field and laboratory he
seeks to employ the tools and methods of modern technology to obtain
a more precise understanding of how people lived in the past. He is
limited only by his ingenuity in making the most effective uses of
these resources.

The current research program of professional historians at the
Museum of History and Technology provides numerous examples of
this broader, more ingenious approach to history. I cite only a few
examples.

Buried treasure—whether it is in the ground or under the sea—
has excited the curiosity of generations of Americans. In recent years
the technical perfection of light diving gear has made undersea treas-
ure hunting an increasingly popular pursuit. But under the leadership
of Mendel L. Peterson, chairman of the Museum’s department of
armed forces history, underwater exploration in the Western Hemi-
sphere has evolved from mere treasure hunting into systematic under-
water archeology. In solving historical problems it combines with
field exploration of underwater sites the study of written records of
shipping and shipwrecks, and of the manufacture and uses of artifacts.
It results in the recovery, preservation, and identification of dated
artifacts which help to document the progress of the introduction of
European culture into the New World, routes and cargoes in colonial
trade, and the development of ships, and of their armament and other
equipment.

At underwater sites off Bermuda this year Peterson has conducted
research in the techniques of surveying, measuring, and recording
undersea remains. ‘Three new instruments for measuring in plan and
elevation were used in exploring the timber remains of a ship believed

to be Spanish and of the late 16th century. An ingenious camera
stand for photographing the remains in plan was built in the form of
a brass tower adjustable in height. Carrying a 35-mm. camera at
the top, the tower is set over the timber remains which have been
marked with numbered ‘“‘tacks”’ in a grid pattern. The photographs,
taken in succession as the tower is moved over the site, later are as-
sembled in a photographic mosaic which becomes a valuable guide
to the artist making the finished drawing of the remains.

Two instruments for measuring remains in elevation proved to be
very successful. The first, a simple sighting device, is settled in the
middle of the site and leveled. With this instrument, a theoretical
MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY—INTRODUCTION 107

plane is established, and at each corner of a square encompassing the
site datum rods are then set in the sea bottom, clear of the timber
remains. With this sighting device, targets are set on the datum rods
and securely fastened. These remain in place throughout the measuring
operation.

After the theoretical plane is established, a measuring frame con-
sisting of heavy aluminum beams is placed on steel stanchions set
vertically on the keelson of the timber remains. The frame is then
secured to the stanchions at the plane established by the sighting device.
Attached to this frame is a rack in which ride—at 6-inch intervals—
measuring rods scaled in inches. Over each ship’s timber in turn,
starting at one end and progressing along the remains, the rack is set,
leveled with the beam, and anchored at the outer end. The measuring
rods are then lowered to contact the frame, and readings are taken
directly from them. In this manner the curvature of each of the ship’s
frames is established. From these data, recorded with a grease pencil
on white plastic sheets, an accurate elevation of the remains can be
drawn.

Techniques for preserving objects recovered from underwater sites
meanwhile are being perfected through research in the Museum
laboratory. These studies include the perfection of a more rapid
method for dehydrating organic materials, and the uses, for wood
specimens, of preservatives that penetrate and strengthen the specimens.

Peterson’s History Under the Sea: A handbook for underwater exploration,
published in 1965, provides the first handbook on this subject ever
printed. This pioneer text and its 56 plates cover the surveying of
underwater sites, field preparation of materials recovered from these
sites, laboratory techniques for preserving artifacts from underwater
explorations, and photographic reproductions of selected metal, glass,
and pottery specimens recovered from underwater sites and processed
in the laboratory.

Eugene Ostroff, associate curator of photography, employed modern
technology in pioneering another field of historical research. Recog-
nizing that image discoloration and fading was making old photo-
graphs in the collections useless for reference or exhibition, he investi-
gated the causes of this deterioration and explored the practicality of
restoring the image. With some of the earliest photographs made by
W. H. F. Talbot of England, who in 1839 invented the photographic
negative, he obtained strikingly successful results. Faded prints in
which the image was not visible to the eye were irradiated with neutrons
in a reactor at the Brookhaven National Laboratories. This converted
some of the image silver into radioactive isotopes. When an unexposed
sheet of x-ray film was placed in contact with the original for a short
108 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965

time, then processed, a clearly visible restored image corresponding to
the original appeared on the x-ray film.

Old photographs can be important historical documents. It is
expected that the historian of the future will be indebted to Ostroff for
his discovery of a means to recover the lost images on these faded
documents.

The use of the modern tape recorder in gaining knowledge of the
past from living informants has proved an effective method of research
in a variety of historical projects. Edwin A. Battison, associate cur-
ator of mechanical and civil engineering, obtained from the surviving
inventor, J. Frank Duryea, information on the construction of the
Duryea automobile built in 1892-93, one of the first gasoline-powered
automobiles built in the United States and the oldest in our collection.
On the basis of these interviews with the inventor it was possible to
restore missing details of the vehicle. The recorded data also pro-
vided some of the information for Donald H. Berkebile’s account of its
construction, The 7893 Duryea Automobile, published by the Smithsonian
Institution this year.

C. Malcolm Watkins, curator of cultural history, carried a tape
recorder to rural Moore County in North Carolina to record surviving
folk-pottery traditions in an area where country folk have made
red earthenware and salt-glazed pottery since before the American
Revolution. There Ben Owen charmingly recalled how his grand-
father had made pottery and described how he himself carried on
the family tradition—from the digging of the clay to the removal of the
fired pot from the kiln. Mrs. Joan Watkins supplemented the oral
account with an extensive series of color photographs of this potter’s
shop and of the stages in his making of pottery. Examples of this
pottery were obtained for the Museum collections.

In the mountains of Virginia and North Carolina last fall Jay Scott
Odell, museum specialist in the section of musical instruments, recorded
traditional folk songs of the Appalachian Highlands played on the
dulcimer and banjo, and descriptions of the making and use of these
instruments from the lips of their makers or the musically talented
descendants of makers. At the same time he photographed the playing
of a dulcimer, made about 1875, which he later obtained for the na-
tional collections. Such thorough documentation will be appreciated
by the historian of future years.

The sounds of history were sweet indeed in the series of concerts
arranged by Mrs. Cynthia Adams Hoover, associate curator of musical
instruments, during the year. The November 11, 1964, concert of
Gustav Leonhardt, harpsichordist, playing on the Museum’s restored
MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY—INTRODUCTION 109

1754 Dulcken harpsichord, and Frans Brueggen, recorder player,
was considered one of the highlights of the Washington musical year.
At popular request, a program of the music of the 1860’s, played on
brass instruments of that period from the collections, was repeated
in an open-air concert on the Mall in June. The musical arrangements
were taken directly from bandbooks of the Third New Hampshire
Regiment of the 1860’s. These and other concerts, played upon the
kinds of instruments for which the music was written, not only delight
those in attendance but are recorded for the study of musicians and
historians.

Surely the museum historian is no less concerned with written his-
tory than is the academic historian—but he consults a greater variety
of sources. He reads history not only in letters and documents, but
also in illustrated trade catalogs, magazine and newspaper advertise-
ments, plans, drawings, paintings, prints, and photographs, and in
three-dimensional objects as well.

The museum historian has the same dedication to detailed accuracy
as does the scholar in the natural sciences. He requires the same
precision in restoring a hundred-year-old machine tool or a two-hun-
dred-year-old highboy as does the paleontologist in his restoration
of a hundred-million-year-old dinosaur.

In his field work the museum historian’s methods resemble those
successfully employed by the anthropologist, be he an archeologist
exploring a prehistoric site occupied by a little-known primitive people,
or an ethnologist obtaining from an aged American Indian informant
verbal information on tribal customs of six decades ago. Historic-
site archeology—on land and under the sea—offers the historian oppor-
tunities to recover plans of ships and of domestic, industrial, and
military structures about which little information is available in written
sources, as well as possibilities of recovering dated artifacts which will
help to document other undated ones. The oral testimony of elderly
men and women provides previously unrecorded details about inven-
tions, manufacturing and crafts processes, and the disappearance or
survival of traditional arts and crafts.

In his dealings with the objects he studies and admires, the mature
museum historian’s interests extend far beyond their aesthetic quali-
ties and beyond the tracing of technological developments per se. Like
the anthropologist, he is concerned with the broader implications of
objects—the roles they played in the cultures which produced them
and the social implications of technological change. He will continue
to employ a variety of techniques and to consult a wide range of
sources in his quest for answers to the problems of history.
Research and Publications
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

A number of major works by members of the department of science
and technology were published or are in press this year. Silvio A.
Bedini, in his Museum Bulletin Early American Scientific Instruments and
their Makers, brought together a wealth of facts and photographs that
has stimulated wide interest in this subject. As a result, enough new
information has been elicited to warrant a revised and enlarged edition,
on which he is working at present. Bedini also has assembled data and
illustrations documenting the scientific instrument as it appears in
American archeology. His purpose is a study of the scientific back-
ground of the exploration and early settlement of the North American
continent up to about 1700, for a book-length work completed in first
draft. The American Philosophical Society now has in press his
Mechanical Universe.

In his Museum Bulletin Bark Canoes and Skin Boats of North America,
Howard I. Chapelle brought order and meaning to the inchoate
50-year accumulation of notes and portions of manuscript left by the
senior author and authority on canoes, Edwin Tappan Adney. This
monograph, carried to completion through the generosity of the
Mariner’s Museum, which supported Chapelle in his work on the
Adney paper and his preparation of the numerous line drawings it
contains, represents a high order of cooperation in museum research,
and makes available information which otherwise might have remained
forever buried in museum archives.

Sami K. Hamarneh’s Bzbliography on Medicine and Pharmacy in Medieval
Islam was published in Stuttgart by the Internationalen Gesellschaft ftir
Geschichte der Pharmazie. And the Early Engineering Reminiscences
(1815-40) of George Escol Sellers, which Eugene S. Ferguson edited and
annotated while he was curator of engineering, appeared as a Museum
Bulletin.

Three other book-length manuscripts are in press: Robert P. Mul-
thauf, The Origin of Chemistry, Uta C. Merzbach (with Garrett Birk-
hoff), Source Book in Classical Analysis, and John H. White, Jr., The
Cincinnati Locomotive Builders. And among the total of 35 publications
listed by the staff this year were a group of historical and analytical
articles on museums of science and technology making up the December
1964 issue of Technology and Culture (vol. 6, no. 1).

A number of publications appeared as a result of research directed to
the documentation of collections. Donald H. Berkebile’s study of the
Duryea automobile exploits a series of tape-recorded interviews with

110
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 111

the surviving inventor J. Frank Duryea, initiated and conducted here
in 1956 and 1957 by Edwin A. Battison. The Duryea automobile,
built in 1892-93, is the oldest in our collection and one of the first
gasoline-powered automobiles constructed in the United States.
Only through these interviews was it possible to restore missing details
of the vehicle.

White’s article on the Pioneer documents a locomotive built in 1851
by Seth Wilmarth in South Boston, Mass., and used primarily on the
Cumberland Valley Railroad in Pennsylvania. The machine was
given to the Museum in 1960 by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.

Bedini’s study of an 18th-century astronomical clock deals with a
timepiece designed, in the words of its inventor, Father Francesco
Borghesi (1723-1802), ‘‘so that I might contemplate leisurely, both
during the day and in the night, the true face of the heavens and of the
seas unobscured by clouds, even though I had no astronomical equip-
ment.” This clock, for which the faculty of eclipse prediction was also
claimed, was presented upon its completion in 1764 to the Empress
Maria Theresa of Austria. It was acquired by the Museum in 1958.

An article by Edwin S. Battison on screw-thread cutting by the
master-screw method is based upon a study of one of the oldest extant
screw-cutting machines, signed ‘‘Manuel Wetschgi, Augspurg’”’ and
dated from the end of the 17th century or the beginning of the 18th.
The machine was received from the Yale and Towne Company in 1959.

Some other research papers published this year were inspired by
work in connection with exhibits. Chapelle’s paper on Robert Fulton’s
“Steam Battery” is one of a series of articles he has based on his design
reconstructions of historically important ships. The subject of the
article, the first steam-powered warship, was designed during the War
of 1812. The reconstruction of this historic ship is based upon plans
located by Chapelle in the Danish Royal Archives in Copenhagen.

A paper on early electromagnetic instruments was published in
connection with the design of the exhibits in electricity by Museum
consultant Robert Chipman. ‘The problem which inspired this paper
was the reconstruction for exhibit of “Schweigger’s multiplier” of
1821, popularly regarded as the progenitor of the galvanometer. In
the course of this work Chipman found that several other instruments
of the same type were developed in the same year by Johann C. Pog-
gendorf and James Cumming. The consequence was an exhibit, in
which five reconstructed instruments are shown, and the present paper,
in which his findings are exposed.

Robert M. Vogel has produced three papers in connection with the
design of the hall of civil engineering. His paper on the engineering
112 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

contributions of Wendel Bollman arose in the dual problem of repre-
senting the work of Bollman in the exhibit of bridge building and of
evaluating an actual bridge, which had been brought to our attention
as the last surviving example of Bollman’s work. Because of the
interesting and unique problems arising during the design and con-
struction of the hall, Vogel has presented the results of his experience
in two papers that describe the manner in which objects and docu-
ments are utilized to produce exhibits which will be both attractive to
a general audience and informative to the specialist.

Walter F. Cannon, who spent part of 1962 and 1963 in London on a
National Science Foundation research grant for the study of science in
England in the 19th century, published the results in two papers,
‘History in Depth: the Early Victorian Period,” and “Scientists and
Broad Churchmen: an Early Victorian Intellectual Network.” He is
now working on a biography of John Herschel.

Hamarneh spent the period June 29 through October 17, 1964, in a
research tour of ten Middle Eastern countries and Spain. In addition
to assembling manuscript data for a history of medicine in medieval
Islam, he collected data for indexing the medical manuscripts in the
Zahiriyah National Library, Damascus.

Edwin A. Battison arranged for and supervised the translation of two
Russian books through the Israel Program for Scientific Translations:
S. V. Tarasov, Technology of watch production (Moscow, 1956), and A. S.
Britkin and S. S. Vidonov’s biography of the machine builder A. K.
Nartov. These translations, which have been completed, will be
published with introductions by Battison.

ARTS AND MANUFACTURES

The new curator of agriculture and forest products, John T. Schle-
becker, took up his duties on June 14, 1965. Since 1959 associate
professor of history at Iowa State University, he is a member of the
executive committee of the Agricultural History Society and an im-
portant contributor to agricultural history studies. His History of
Dairying in the United States 1607-1964 is in press, and he has in progress
a much-needed general history of American agriculture.

Paul V. Gardner spent six weeks in Europe examining 22 museum
and private collections for the purpose of verifying attributions and
preparing material for a definitive catalog of the unique collection of
18th-century European porcelains received from Dr. Hans Syz. In
the same connection and with the support and cooperation of the
Ceramica Stiftung of Basel, Switzerland, arrangements were made by
Dr. Syz for consultation in Washington with Dr. Rainer Riickert, Ober-
konservator of the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich, Germany,
who spent the period April 19 through June 14, 1965, working with
Dr. Syz and the staff on special problems.

Dr. Syz, who on April 27, 1965, was appointed an honorary fellow
of the Smithsonian Institution in recognition of his scholarly contri-
butions to the history of ceramics, continues to spend several days every
month on the project.

Gardner, who has spent a major portion of his time revising the
script for the new hall of ceramics to include the Syz collection, has
nearly completed his biography of Frederick Carder, founder of Steuben
Glass Works. While in Europe, he visited London and the English
Midlands in search of material concerning Carder’s early training and
experience. J. Jefferson Miller II was also heavily involved in the
revision of the hall of ceramics script to include recent important
116 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

acquisitions in the Syz and Sutherland collections. He has contributed
extensively to the material for the Syz catalog.

Jacob Kainen continued his study of the Dutch engraver Hendrick
Goltzius (1558-1617).

Eugene Ostroff has developed a new technique to restore faded
photographic images through neutron irradiation. This work, de-
scribed on page 107, is the subject of a paper, ‘Early Fox Talbot
Photographs and Restoration by Neutron Irradiation,” to be published
by the Journal of Photographic Science (London). Ostroff is continuing
his research into Talbot’s experimental procedures. As part of his
investigation he examined four Talbot work diaries, and he uncovered
a group of Talbot’s photographic experiments which has been brought
back to Washington for study. He also found what may prove to be
the earliest negatives on a transparent flexible-base material. These
photographs by Nevil S. Maskelyne were made, ca. 1860, on very thin
sheets of mica. At the invitation of Beaumont Newhall, director of
George Eastman House, Ostroff presented a paper describing this work
at the Symposium on the History of Photography and served as modera-
tor of a panel on the preservation of photographic materials.

A project idea originated by Mr. Ostroff has resulted in a unique
photograph of the United States. This consists of an unbroken aerial
color photograph of the United States from the east to the west coast,
and, as a result, the longest panoramic picture in the world was pro-
duced. The project involved the cooperation of the United States
Navy, North American Aviation, Chicago Aerial Industries, and Gen-
eral Aniline and Film Corporation.

Museum technician David Haberstitch, who joined the staff in
November 1964, has investigated the history of the section of photogra-
phy. His report concerning its establishment and early activities
reveals that the Smithsonian Institution was probably the first museum
in the United States to collect material related to the history of
photography.

Philip W. Bishop worked on studies of early drilling methods and has
documented the procedure used by Colonel Drake in drilling the first
commercial oil well. A study of depreciation methods and _ their
influence on the process of innovation, especially during the period
1870-1914, is also in progress.

Research concerned with the preparation of scripts for the halls of
nuclear energy, petroleum, iron and steel, and general manufacturing,
has required continuous consultation with the technical staffs of in-
dustrial firms and scientific laboratories and has resulted, incidentally,
in a number of substantial gifts to the Museum. John N. Hoffman,
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 117

who entered on duty July 12, 1964, as associate curator of manufac-
tures and heavy industries, has developed a design for the hall of coal.
He has begun a study of the significance of the canal in the develop-
ment of Pennsylvania’s coal resources in the early 19th century.

Mrs. Grace Rogers Cooper continued her research on the spinning
wheel and its use in America from the Colonial era through the 19th
century.

Rita J. Adrosko made progress in her work on American coverlets and
began two short-term projects: one on Jacquard-woven silk pictures
and Jacquard imitation tapestries, and the second on the use of natural
dyes in 18th- and 19th-century American textiles.

Museum specialist Doris M. Bowman located a number of excellent
examples of early machine-made net of the late 18th and early 19th
century for her study of that article. Her catalog of the Museum’s
excellent collection of sewing birds and similar clamping devices is also
further advanced.

CIVIL HiSTORY

Documentation of an important and extensive collection of over
350 examples of American folk art, the Eleanor and Mabel Van
Alstyne collection, which came to the museum in December, partly
118 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

by gift and partly on loan from Mrs. Fred Dana Marsh of Woodstock,
N.Y., was undertaken by Peter Welsh and Anne Castrodale. This
collection includes rare examples of the late 18th century and extends
to the early 20th century. Carved animals from carousels, circus
wagon figures, and shop and tavern signs abound in the group, which
also includes paintings, calligraphy, weathervanes, ships’ ornaments,
and small carved birds and animals.

The original interior appearance and furnishings of the Smithsonian
building have been the subject of an extensive research project ini-
tiated by Richard H. Howland. In this he has been assisted by
Rodris C. Roth. This nationally significant architectural landmark
was designed in the 1840’s by the noted architect James Renwick,
and the long-range plan of renovation is intended to produce an
interior that is in harmony with the exterior, and yet can serve use-
fully as offices and exhibit areas. The research is nearing completion:
renovation of the Regents’ room and the Secretary’s offices has been
completed to reflect the period of the third quarter of the 19th century,
the epoch of Joseph Henry’s secretaryship; and considerable work
has already been accomplished on the renovation of the great hall,
which will serve as an exhibit area and visitors’ lounge. Welsh has
collaborated in choosing for it exhibits that reflect the significant
research accomplishments of the museums and major bureaus of the
Smithsonian.

Museum specialist Jay Scott Odell made two field trips to the south-
ern Appalachian mountain country, primarily in Virginia and North
Carolina, to search for American folk instruments for the collections
and to record the present traditions of musical performance in those
areas.

Concerned with interrelated objectives of research and exhibits,
C. Malcolm Watkins and Mrs. Joan Pearson Watkins, research col-
laborator, during October sought a post-Gold Rush period ranch
house kitchen in northern California to install in the Museum’s hall of
everyday life in the American past. One was found in a long-aban-
doned house, built about 1862 at the foot of Mount Shasta, which
exemplifies both the transfer of traditional Eastern folk concepts of
farm-house architecture and the adaptation of design to new Western
conditions. With the cooperation of George H. Watson, specialist
in restoration of old structures, the house was thoroughly analyzed
and measured, and its plans were drawn. Mrs. Watkins made a
detailed photographic study of it, and interviewed descendants of the
builder, a gold-miner-turned-rancher named George Washington
Arbaugh, and others.
RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS—-ARTS AND MANUFACTURES 119

Mr. Watkins is also engaged in research relative to a frame “‘salt
box” house built in 1853 in Half Moon Bay, San Mateo County.
Embodying ideas from 18th- and early 19th-century Eastern proto-
types as well as adaptive features typical of California, the house is
rich in implications of cultural transfer and cultural change.

Mrs. Elvira Clain-Stefanelli published her Select Numismatic Bibli-
ography, a compilation of 4962 titles, arranged by subject, that sum-
marize research in numismatics during the past two centuries, including
the study of medals and decorations, and a history of prices and related
economic and historical problems.

Vladimir Clain-Stefanelli, in addition to his publications, gave two
lectures, ““The Future of United States Coinage” and “Historical
Notes on Some Coinage Metals,” that attracted wide press coverage
because their themes touched on the impending shortage of silver for
United States coinage.

Underwater exploration, with its related activities, continued to be
a major element in the program of Mendel L. Peterson. Research on
the techniques of surveying and measuring underwater remains pro-
ceeded on Bermuda sites. Three new instruments for measuring in
plan and elevation were tested on the timber remains of a ship believed
to be Spanish of the late 16th century. Their use is described in detail
and illustrated on pages 105-106.

Research on techniques of preserving organic materials recovered
from underwater sites was continued with substantial results by museum
specialist Alan B. Albright. The following investigations were carried
on:

1. The devising of a rapid method of dehydration, using heated
alcohol.

2. Tests using acetone as a dehydration agent.

3. Experiments using various heat ranges in attempting to speed
up the penetration of PEG 4000 in dehydrated wood.

4. Experiments in the use of PEG 6000 in the place of PEG 4000
where the greater inherent strength of the higher weight PEG would
be useful in restoring very fragile organic objects.

5. Research into the use of fiberglass resin as a wood preservative.

6. Continued research in the problem of the preservation of iron
recovered from under water; research into the use of high temperatures
and wax impregnation under vacuum in an attempt to eliminate the
long process involved in the use of electro-chemical baths.

7. Restoration of ceramic materials.

The results of these researches were published by Peterson this year in
his History under the Sea: A Handbook for Underwater Exploration.

In the division of military history Edgar M. Howell and museum
specialist Donald E. Kloster completed in draft the first volume of a
comprehensive descriptive and critical catalog on United States Army
dress to include uniforms, headgear, and footwear. In connection
with this work, they actively assisted the Department of the Army in
research which resulted in the adoption of a new-type headgear.
Howell continued his work on contemporary graphics relating to the
role of the Army in the opening of the West, publishing a second
monograph on the subject. Kloster completed as partial requirement
for the degree of master of arts a thesis, ““The United States Uniform
from 1832 to 1851, from Romance to Practicality.”

In the division of naval history Philip K. Lundeberg broadened his
long-range study of modern commerce warfare, completing a survey of
“The Impact of Undersea Warfare upon Allied Strategy during the
First World War,” which he presented at the annual convention of the
American Historical Association. Delivered at a session sponsored by
the American Military Institute on the influence of technology upon
strategy in World War I, this paper re-examined the maritime con-
flict in terms of the downfall of Imperial Russia, as well as Imperial
Germany. Notwithstanding the fact that undersea operations utterly
failed Germany, their most ardent protagonist during the First World
War, submarine and mine warfare exerted a profound influence upon
Great Britain’s peripheral strategy, repeatedly frustrating her attempts
to achieve effective maritime collaboration with her isolated eastern
ally.

Melvin H. Jackson continued his study of naval muzzle-loading
ordnance of the 18th and 19th centuries. A field trip to Europe, which
covered the coastal region from Sweden to Spain and included southern
France and England, produced from naval museums and archives
basic information which will enrich material contained in a manu-
script on muzzle-loading ordnance prepared by the late Colonel
Carey Tucker. At the Legersmuseum in Leiden, a series of 50 draw-
ings concerning brass cannon founding in the 18th century was
brought to Jackson’s attention. These drawings by Pieter Verbruggen
(who, with his father Jan, was master-founder of the Royal Brass
Foundry at Woolwich, England, from 1770 to 1800) proved of such
interest, from both the point of view of ordnance and the history of
technology, that plans are under way for their publication. Jackson’s
manuscript “Caribbean Vortex, 1793-1801,” a maritime history of the
Wars of the French Revolution in the Caribbean was completed and is
under consideration by a university press. His lecture at the Walter
Library, University of Minnesota, Salt, Sugar and Slaves: The Dutch in

Collection.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

The receipt of a large collection often poses a problem in cataloging
and documentation. Such collections sometimes come to the Museum
because their processing has been beyond the capacity of other museums
or private collectors. The extant records may be incomplete, and
their rehabilitation and full documentation may require years. Three
large collections were handled this year: the Hirsch collection of water
meters (96 items), the Read collection of phonographs (93 items), and
the Arthur collection of timekeeping devices (about 2600 items).
Processing them called for a special effort in which summer interns and
outside consultants assisted Deborah Mills in their cataloging.

A program to make operable the majority of machines to be exhibited
in the hall of heavy machinery was undertaken by William Henson
and Marion Jarboe. The latter also began occasional demonstrations
of the machine tools in the hall of tools. An alarm system devised by
Elliot Sivowitch and Roy LaRoche of the division of electricity has
been installed experimentally for the protection of several objects not
cased.

ARTS AND MANUFACTURES

A new technique for restoring faded photographs through neutron
irradiation was devised by Eugene Ostroff (it is described in detail on
page 107). A small selection of the most valuable photographs in the
collection is now being treated by this method.

THE COLLECTIONS—CARE AND CONSERVATION 125

Museum specialist Elliott Hawkins continued a long-range program
of increasing the collections of periodicals, monographs, and books
devoted to motion pictures.

The cleaning of George Washington’s headquarters tent, a major
conservation project, was jointly undertaken by the divisions of textiles
and military history. With plans for its permanent exhibition, this
Revolutionary War tent, which had been carefully stored for 75 years
in the military history collections, was carefully examined. It was
found basically in sturdy condition, but the metal hooks and eyes
used to fasten the sidewalls to the top had rusted and had stained and
deterioriated the linen fabric, leaving it in an acid condition. The
tent was also mud stained and generally dusty. After consultation, it
was decided that for safe preservation, the tent, of single ply, z-twist,
plain-woven, unbleached linen, should be cleaned to neutralize the
acid condition which is very harmful to cellulose fibers.

Stretched out, the sidewalls measured 82’3’’ long and between 6'4’’
and 5/1%’’ high. The top measured 34’ by 20’8’’ and was edged
with a valance trimmed in a narrow woven red wool-twill tape of 2-ply,
s-twist worsted yarns. Before work could be started, the 171 rusty
hooks and eyes were removed to prevent further deterioration from
rust. The tent parts were then protected with fiberglass screening
and carefully vacuumed with a hand-type, low-suction vacuum cleaner
to remove all loose dust and dirt.

Although neutralized distilled water would have been preferred,
the quantity required made it more economical to use de-ionized water
with a non-ionic detergent. To handle the two portions of the tent,
a wooden frame 11’x7’ by 7’’ deep was constructed to support a con-
tainer made of two layers of polyethylene sheets that could be clamped
and unclamped to the frame as required.

The sidewall portion was folded into eight layers, placed on fiber-
glass screening of suitable size, and lowered into a bath of 180 gallons of
neutral, de-ionized water at room temperature, where it was soaked
for 65 hours. This removed the large water-mark stains on the tent
and some of the soil. Supported on the screen, the sidewall was re-
moved from the bath, the soiled water pumped out, and the dirt film
was wiped off and rinsed from the polyethylene bath liner, after which
the bath was refilled with a wash solution consisting of 4 oz. of non-
ionic detergent to each gallon of de-ionized water, the detergent
first having been dissolved in beakers of water over low heat. When
the entire bath was at room temperature, the sidewall was lowered into
it and remained there for 3% hours. The only mechanical action used
was a gentle pushing and smoothing movement by hand to eliminate
air bubbles that formed between the layers of tent. After being re-
126 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

moved from the detergent solution, the sidewall was rinsed four times.
Each rinse solution was tested for pH, and the final reading was a very
satisfactory 7.1.

After removal from the final rinse, the sidewall was allowed to drain
on the screening until excess moisture was eliminated. It was then
laid on a polyethylene film placed over a terrazzo floor and carefully
smoothed flat while damp. The linen adhered to the plastic and
dried smooth overnight. White absorbent towels, laid along the full
length, took up excess moisture and protected the linen from dust.
It was then rolled until the case was completed for exhibition.

The top was treated in the same manner, except that, because of the
shaped construction, it was dried on a frame stretched with fiberglass
screening and supported two feet from the ground to allow a good
circulation of air and to keep drying time at a minimum. At installa-
tion it was lightly sprayed with distilled water and smoothed to the
shape of its contour support structure.

The entire project, under the general supervision of Mrs. Grace R.
Cooper, was carried out by museum technician Maureen Collins of the
textile laboratory, assisted by museum technician Lois Vann of the
division of textiles and museum specialist Donald Kloster of the division
of military history.

CIVIL HISTORY

A new, well-equipped conservation laboratory designed by museum
specialist Jay Scott Odell, has facilities for the restoration of all types
of musical instruments and includes a “‘go-bar deck,” an adaptation of
an 18th-century device for gluing bridges on harpsichord sound boards.
With the completion of this laboratory, most of the restoration work
can now be done at the museum under controlled conditions. Once
the collections are in order, this shop will also be used for experiments
in the building of modern reproductions of medieval, Renaissance, and
Baroque instruments.

Specially designed metal storage racks, installed for keyboard instru-
ments, are cantilevered to allow for storage flexibility. The keyboard
instruments, with their legs removed, are mounted on wooden pallets
and lifted into place by a fork-lift truck. This system permits ready
examination of the instruments, and is efficient enough to store a major
portion of the Smithsonian’s collection of more than 200 keyboard
instruments.

Under the guidance of museum technician Mrs. Betty J. Walters,
considerable progress was made in assembling data on certain phases
of the collections for use in a Termatrex data-retrieval system. Ulti-
mately, it is expected that major portions of the collections, with their
THE COLLECTIONS—GIFTS AND ADDITIONS 127

associated catalog records, can be made useful in a variety of ways
hitherto impossible by visual or manual means.

More than 95 percent of the entire reference collection of philatelic
items was moved from the old Arts and Industries building into the
new museum within two days, and the move was completed without
damage to any of the 9,800,000 specimens handled.

ARMED FORCES HISTORY

Experiments were begun to test the effectiveness of a commercial
rust-inhibitor formula C.R.C., which appears to be most effective and
requires less work than is presently required in applying a wax formula.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

A number of notable collections were acquired this year by the
department of science and technology. Among them are the Arthur
collection of timekeeping devices, the Read collection of phonographs,
a rare early American woodworking shop, a collection of wood-
carvings, and the “first generation’? of communications satellites.
128 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

The first, assembled by James Arthur, who also endowed the Arthur
lectures at the Smithsonian, is especially remarkable for Japanese
and early American clocks and for American watches. It was re-
ceived on permanent loan from New York University. The Read
collection was received from Oliver Read, co-author of the book
From Tinfoil to Stereo. It contains such rarities as the Edison coin-
operated phonograph of 1897, and it more than doubles the size of
the Museum’s phonograph collection. The woodworking shop, from
Mansfield, Conn., contains an up-and-down sawmill, water turbines,
and, among other machines, one of the earliest extant lathes with a
completely intact automatic feed. It also contains a very important
gage attachment for woodturning with handtools, which allows
‘‘automatic”’ sizing of the work.

The wood carvings, gift of Joel Barlow, include a number of ship
half-models, which augment our already strong collection, and also
decorative ship carvings and figureheads, of which we have heretofore
had very few. And in a highly successful example of systematic
collecting of pioneer apparatus in a particular field, Bernard S. Finn
succeeded in acquiring from five different donors, for a special ex-
hibition of “‘communications in space,’”’ actual examples of the first
eight communication satellites.

Among the important individual specimens added to the collections
were the following:

A Chinese monumental equatorial sundial of the Ming dynasty.
This instrument, 52 inches in height, is the only sundial of its type
known to exist in the Western world. Its construction is of native
copper gilded by the mercury process. The 25-inch dial is designed
to be read on both sides, with the shadow marking the hours on the
upper side during the summer months and on the lower side during
the winter.

The second ammonia-beam maser apparatus, designed in 1955
by Charles Townes of Columbia University, a joint gift of Townes
and the University. The maser is an outstanding development of
20th-century quantum physics for which the inventor shared the Nobel
Prize in 1964.

An early American-made Schmidt telescope, built in the 1930's
by C. A. and H. A. Lower of San Diego, Calif., was received from
San Diego State College.

A White Motor bus of 1917, received from the Baltimore Transit
Co., the first commercial transit motor vehicle in the collection.

A model, to the scale of 1” equals 1’, of the famed ‘“‘Louisville
pumping engine,” one of the masterpieces of Erasmus D. Leavitt,
builder of the most efficient steam engines of the 19th century. Before

Chinese equatorial sundial, recently obtained for the national collections
(see p. 128), is 52 inches high and measures 48 inches in overall length.
The diameter of the dial is 25 inches. It is constructed of almost pure
native copper assembled with wide dovetail joints, hammered into surface
smoothness from the interior, and soldered. The decorative motifs are
chiseled and engraved from the outside, and the whole is covered with
heavy fire gilt. The dial is read on both sides—on the upper surface during
summer and on the lower surface during winter.

Early 15-passenger motor bus with solid-rubber tires, gift of Baltimore Transit
Co., was built in 1917 by the White Motor Company. ‘The body was made
by J. G. Brill, the famous streetcar builder. Below: Bow view of model of

the original engine was scrapped jin 1962, this fully operating model
was begun by the builder and donor, Mr. Harry H. Catching of
Lexington, Ky.

A model of Columbus’ flagship of 1492, Santa Maria, constructed
at the Museo Maritimo in Barcelona, under the supervision of its
director, José Ma. Martinez-Hidalgo y Teran. This model, presented
by Lawrence H. M. Vineburgh, was built in connection with the
full-sized reconstruction of the Santa Maria for the New York World’s
Fair. The project was directed by Sr. Hidalgo, as the leading authority
on the ships of Columbus, with the advisory participation of Howard I.
Chapelle.

ARTS AND MANUFACTURES

With the cooperation of the Fine Hardwoods Association and
specialist manufacturers some 200 panels of foreign and domestic
woods were presented for incorporation into a decorative screen,
designed by the exhibits laboratory, that will provide the hall of forest
products with an encyclopedic account of available timbers. For the
agriculture collections a fine contemporary model of the first field
pick-up hay baler (1932) was received from Mr. Leslie R. Tallman,
son of the inventor.

The ceramics collections continued to receive support from previous
donors, notably Mrs. William A. Sutherland and Robert H. McCauley.
Dr. Hans Syz formally donated 16 extremely valuable items of that
part of his collection still on loan to the Museum. Other major gifts
were those of Dr. Lloyd Hawes who presented 23 pieces of 18th-
century English earthenware, including some excellent examples of
polychrome salt glaze; and of Mr. and Mrs. Edward M. Pflueger,
whose gift included an extremely fine pair of Chinoiserie busts from
the Bow Factory (ca. 1755).

The Holmegaards Glasvaerk of Denmark and the N. V. Koninklijke
Nederlandsche Glasfabriek ‘“‘Leerdam” of Holland added to the
collections of contemporary glass some fine pieces which it was possible
to include in the present exhibition area. Ray Winfield Smith’s
collection of ancient glass was lent to the Museum for installation in
the glass gallery in September 1964, and during the year ten pieces
from this collection were acquired.

A splendid set of 31 Venetian views by Antonio Canal (1697-1768),
commonly called Canaletto, constituting the entire body of his etchings,
was received from Mrs. Francis P. Garvan of New York City. Among
other important acquisitions were outstanding examples of German
Expressionist printmaking including work by Max Beckmann, Ernst

789-427—66——20
130 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel, Franz Marc, and Max Pechstein;
one of the earliest known lithographs Landscape with Men in Armor
(1803) by Joseph Fischer; and the aquatint Green Clown with Boy
by Georges Rouault. American contributions were represented by the
etching Woolworth Tower (1913) by the pioneer modernist John Marin,
and the color woodcut View from Taormina by Carol Summers.

The A. B. Dick Company of Chicago presented an early model (ca.
1885) of the Edison mimeograph, an important pioneer example of
duplicating equipment.

To the collection of historic photographic equipment were added
the first Polaroid-Land camera to be produced (1948); a prototype of
the first Leica camera, invented by Osker Barnack (1912) and marketed
by Leitz in 1924; and two examples of the Technicolor Corporation’s
3-step color motion-picture cameras associated with the introduction
of high-quality color motion pictures in 1930.

Colonel and Mrs. Burnett Brown of Lacock Abbey, Wiltshire, the
home of W. H. F. Talbot, gave a rare copy of Part VI (April 1846)
of the latter’s publication The Pencil of Nature, the first book to be
illustrated with photographs.

Dr. Zoltan Bay of the National Bureau of Standards deposited the
original electron-multiplier developed by him (1938) at the Institute
of Atomic Physics of the Royal Hungarian University, Budapest.
This apparatus, to be included in the hall of nuclear energy, repre-
sented a turning point in the development of instruments for counting
elementary particles. An equally critical stage in the study of nuclear
physics is represented by the million-volt Van de Graaff accelerator
(1931) given by Merle A. Tuve of the Carnegie Institution’s Division
of Terrestrial Magnetism. Among other achievements, this machine
brought protons close enough to atomic nuclei to overwhelm the inher-
ent electrical repulsion, and so demonstrated the existence of the short-
range nuclear force. Pioneer work among elementary particles was
commemorated by Professor Conversi of the Universita degli Studi,
Rome, Italy, in the form of a replica of his experiment with Piccioni
and others (1941-1943) demonstrating the noncapture of mu mesons.

A number of substantial gifts were received from industry for the
iron and steel hall. Ford Motor Company Fund and U.S. Steel
Corporation are supporting the construction of large models of a
foundry and of an integrated steel plant, respectively. The Allis-
Chalmers Company gave a model of a pelletizing plant, Bausch and
Lomb a bench metallograph, and the Tinius Olsen Company a display
of hardness-testing equipment.

The coal industry contributed a variety of miners’ tools, while a
THE COLLECTIONS—GIFTS AND ADDITIONS 131

further portion of a collection of tinware, previously on loan, was
converted to a gift.

Plans for the hall of petroleum were virtually completed by agreement
with the engineers of various firms for demonstrations of oil production
techniques to accompany the actual machinery. A group of oil men
in and around Tulsa, Okla., have contributed, through Mr. W. H.
Helmerich, a 57-foot mural describing the oil industry. This mural,
now being painted by Mr. Delbert Jackson, staff artist of the Pan
American Petroleum Corporation, will embellish the entrance to the
hall of petroleum.

The Austrian Imperial bridal veil, an outstanding example of Brus-
sels Point de Gaze lace, was presented to the textile collections by Mrs.
Marjorie Merriweather Post. The veil was worn by Princess Stephanie
of Belgium for her wedding to Crown Prince Rudolph in 1881. Scat-
tered over the Brussels needlepoint réseau, sheerest of all lace grounds,
are garlands and sprays of ferns and flowers of many kinds. The crown
of the veil is powdered with tiny rosebuds, while the double-headed
eagle of Austria dominates the center back. The arms of the provinces
of Austria and Belgium form the border, with the arms of Belgium at
the center.

Also added to the textile collections were nine fragments of Egyptian
tapestry-woven fabric, woven between the third and eighth centuries,
A.D. These interesting examples of early tapestry-weaving technique
will be incorporated into the expanded area of tapestry weaving in
the new textile hall.

CIVIL HISTORY

The collections were enriched in a variety of ways. The Honorable
David K. E. Bruce presented numerous objects of French and English
decorative arts and furniture. Mrs. Gustave A. Murman gave the
woodwork of a Federal-period parlor from a house in Martha’s Vine-
yard, Mass. This room is remarkable for the primitive landscape
painting that appears in an oval cartouche in the rectangular over-
mantel panel above the fireplace. The room, with contemporary
furniture, will be installed in the hall of everyday life in the American
past. It was moved from its site by the Museum’s restoration specialist,
George H. Watson. The Eleanor and Mabel Van Alstyne collection,
containing outstanding examples of folk art of the United States, was
given by Mrs. Fred Dana Marsh. In addition to the kitchen of the
George Washington Arbaugh ranch house in Siskiyou County, Calif.,
discovery of which is described on pages 118 and 138, the collections of
132 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

Californiana were greatly enriched by a unique figure of a hunter,
carved of redwood, holding a gun in one hand and a partridge in the
other. The wheeled platform on which it stands and its costume both
confirm the traditional belief that it was carved, in about 1850, as a
sign for a gun shop in San José.

A handsome bass viola da gamba was acquired for the collection of
musical instruments. This fine instrument, made in London, 1718, by
Barak Norman, who is regarded as the Stradivarius of the viola da
gamba, is richly carved with floral designs and an elaborate monogram
on the back and sides. A carved male figure appearson the head. In
excellent condition, this instrument, when not in use in Museum
concerts, will be on exhibit.

At a ceremony on December 18, 1964, Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson
contributed to the First Ladies collection a most significant addition,
the satin evening dress worn by her at a state dinner at the White
House in December 1964. Presented by Mrs. Gladys P. Lehmann
was one of a group of 188 arm chairs ordered in 1818 by Henry Clay
and used in the United States House of Representatives until 1857.
The chair, upholstered in its original black horsehair, bears the label of
the maker, T. Constantine and Company of New York City. The
Honorable John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House, presented the
Museum with the flag flown at the Capitol during the time the body of
President Kennedy was lying in state.

Among the pieces of unusually fine jewelry given by Mrs. Merri-
weather Post are a necklace of diamonds and oriental emeralds and a
ring set with a large oblongemerald. Herdaughter, Mme. Léon Barzin,
gave a pair of pear-shaped diamond earrings once owned by Marie
Antionette; another daughter, Mrs. Augustus Riggs IV, presented a
seed-pearl bag with platinum frame set with rubies, emeralds, and
sapphires.

Remarkable during the past year was the increased number of
institutions and private individuals from abroad contributing to the
growth of the numismatic collections. Among them were the Hermit-
age in Leningrad; the mints of Australia, the Netherlands, Norway,
Nationalist China, and Pakistan; the banks of Guatemala, New Zea-
land, and Venezuela; the Deutsche Bundesbank; the Bayerische
Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank; the Australian Numismatic Society;
as well as engravers and medallic art companies from Denmark and
Italy. Frederick Hauck donated an impressive collection of 2478 gold
coins, among them 1918 United States pieces which filled many gaps
in the branch-mint issues in the national collections, and 560 foreign
gold and platinum coins as well as medals encompassing the entire
THE COLLECTIONS—GIFTS AND ADDITIONS 133

world. Other additions to the United States series came from Mrs.
F. C. C. Boyd, who gave 934 United States tokens and medalets.

From the Stack family in New York came many donations, among
which should be noted particularly a group of trial impressions of
United States coins and pay orders signed in 1795 by David Ritten-
house, first Director of the United States Mint. Mr. Willis H. du Pont
added to his previous gifts of Russian coins, formerly owned by the
Grand Duke G. Mikhailovitch, a group of 923 coins and medals in
silver and bronze encompassing the period from Catherine II to
Alexander I, Mrs. Wayte Raymond contributed over 2000 foreign
coins struck during the 19th and 20th centuries. A well-rounded
collection of coins of Nepal from the 17th through the 20th century was
presented by Mr. Paul W. Rose.

Outstanding among the philatelic objects acquired is a unique cover
and its enclosure, carried by John Wise in his balloon Jupiter, August
17, 1859, from Lafayette, Ind., on the first attempt to carry American
mail by air under authority of postal officials. ‘The cover was pur-
chased through the Charles and Rosanna Batchelor fund and the
Milton A. Holmes Memorial fund. A specialized collection of 2392
stamps of various nations commemorating Rotary International was
received from Dr. Joseph H. Kler of New Brunswick, N.J. Portions
of this collection, important for its scope and completeness, were
exhibited at a special ceremony in Washington, D.C., held to observe
the issuance of new Rotary commemorative stamps by the Republic
of China. An additional 80,000 postage stamps, with perforated
initials, were given by Mr. and Mrs. Victor J. Van Lint of Riverside,
Calif., and additional essays, proofs, and photographs of the stamps of
China were given by Mr. and Mrs. R. O. D. Hopkins of Contoocook,
N.H.

ARMED FORCES HISTORY

Significant additions to the national collection of historic warship
models, being installed by the division of naval history in the new hall
of armed forces history, include an attractive admiralty-style model
of the 44-gun H.M.S. Boston, a vessel constructed for the Royal
Navy in 1748 by Yankee shipwrights; a superb model of the United
States Revenue cutter Bear, representing that historic vessel under sail
during her late 19th-century service in Alaskan waters; and impressive
models of the nuclear submarine George Washington, the nuclear frigate
Bainbridge, and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Vigilant.

A remarkable group of maps and nautical charts, located at Ellicott
City, Md., by Philip K. Lundeberg, includes an early hydrographic
134 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

survey (ca. 1828) of the harbor of Annapolis, Md.; pre-construction
maps of the proposed Chesapeake and Potomac Canal and the Erie
Canal; early 19th-century nautical charts of North American waters,
retailed by Edmund Blunt; and, most significant for the history of
exploration, a series of four manuscript charts of the southern coast of
South America prepared during the Malaspina Expedition, an official
survey conducted by the Spanish Navy in that quarter from 1798 to
1799.

The Medal of Honor and other decorations, orders, and service
medals awarded Major George G. McMurtry for conspicuous gallantry
in action with the “Lost Battalion” in World War I were presented by
Mrs. McMurtry. The Medal of Honor is the only example of this
unique decoration from the modern period, during which it has been
rarely awarded, in the national collections. From the Patent Office
came an important group of ordnance patent models that supplement
the already extensive and unique collection in the division of military
history. A rare Confederate cutlass was received from Douglas
R. Williams.

The collections of materials from underwater sites were increased
substantially during the year through field activity in Bermuda during
July and August 1965. A large collection of sherds from the Spanish
site, believed to be late 16th century, were acquired. From these frag-
ments some 15 individual shapes of redware pottery probably can be
reconstructed. A significant collection of ordnance materials recov-
ered from the site of L’Herminie, a French frigate which sank in 1838,
includes a device which may be a pill-lock firing mechanism for the
heavy guns. If this identification proves to be correct, the device will
be a very rare specimen, as this type of lock was transitional and in use
for only a brief period.

An early 18th-century iron naval cannon came to the collections as a
gift from the DACOR Corporation through its vice president, Mr.
D.L. Davison. This piece was recovered from a site, as yet unidentified,
lying on Banner Reef south of Jamaica, West Indies.
Exhibits

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

Two major exhibition halls were opened in their entirety, and two
others in part. The hall of civil engineering was dedicated on July 8,
1964, and the hall of American merchant shipping, on November 12,
1964. In September 1964, the refrigeration and diesel sections of
the hall of heavy machinery were opened, and in February 1965,
that portion of the hall of electricity representing communications,
power, and electrical measurement.

The division of electricity undertook a notable program of special
exhibitions. In July 1964, the exhibition “Communications in Space”
brought before the Museum’s visitors the story of communications
satellites from its beginning in 1958. The exhibit is based upon
eight operable satellites received from the American Telephone and
Telegraph Co. (Telstar I), National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration (Echo I, Relay I, and Syncom II), Department of the Army
(Score and Courier), U.S. Air Force and the Lincoln Laboratory of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Westford), and the American
Radio Relay League (Oscar). The exhibit is completed by an ani-
mated diorama illustrating the variety of modern communications
systems and by an exhibit relating to the Satellite Communications
Corporation. For this exhibit, which is scheduled for a 2-year showing,
an illustrated brochure was prepared.

Special exhibits were opened on the history of electrical transformers,
on early modern scientific instruments, and on the Verrazano-Narrows
bridge. The exhibit of transformers, in October 1964, was occasioned
by the loan of two historic transformers of 1885 by the Budapest
Historical Museum. Through the courtesy of the Hungarian Gov-
ernment Peter Asztalos of the Ganz Electrical Works of Budapest
presented two lectures here in connection with this exhibit. The
exhibit of early modern instruments consisted of a collection, chiefly of
17th- and 18th-century instruments, owned by David H. H. Felix
of Philadelphia.

A showing in March and April 1965 of 43 drawings and paintings
by Lili Réthi recorded the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows
bridge, 1961-65. Also shown in March 1965 was a collection of
prints from the civil engineering collections, to be circulated by the
Smithsonian traveling exhibition service.

ARTS AND MANUFACTURES

In September the halls of hand and photomechanical graphic-arts
processes were opened. To the collections and exhibits transferred
from the old building were added new cases and redesigned displays,
among them a handsome free-standing installation of the diorama on
Japanese woodcutting. The first special exhibition, “Sporting and
Western Lithographs by Currier & Ives,’? was shown in the special
exhibition hall, April through May 1965. The exhibit of photographs
by Sam Falk, installed June 1964 in the exhibit hall in the Arts and
Industries building, was extended through the year.

Installation of the Tuve Van de Graaff accelerator in the hall of
nuclear energy was virtually completed. This machine was dismantled
at the division of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution
under the supervision of M. A. Tuve and Louis Brown. ‘The supporting
columns were redesigned by the staff. The reinstallation by exhibits
specialist Abraham Richards and museum technicians John Carter
and Francis Gadson has required meticulous measurements and the
fitting of a complicated mass of instrumentation in an area difficult
of access. |

Plans were advanced for extension of the demonstration program of
the division of textiles to include spinning as well as weaving. In
January demonstrations of tapestry weaving started on an experimental
basis in the Arts and Industries building. These “‘live’”’ exhibits, even
on their present limited scale, continue to draw local residents as
well as tourists, who actively participate by asking questions.

Examples of contemporary and 19th-century hand-weaving and
needlework were lent to the Instituto de Cultura Hispanica for a
special exhibition in Madrid, “Arte Popular de America y Filipanas.” In-
cluded were a 20th-century afghan, poncho, stole, guest towel, and
overshot coverlet, as well as a 19th-century overshot coverlet, a silk
slumber throw of 1883, and an applique album quilt of 1847.

Preparation for the reopening of the textile hall in the Museum of
History and Technology is under way. One area of the new hall
will be reserved for special changing exhibits drawn from the collections
and from temporary loans.

Part of the glass gallery was opened September 18, 1964. A special
exhibition of 65 contemporary glass objects chosen by the curator and
given by Leerdam factory in Holland is being installed in it. The
opening of the ceramic hall, in production throughout the year, is
scheduled for early spring, 1966.

hoped to modify the hive and install a larger colony during the current
season.

CIVIL HISTORY

The numismatic displays in the Arts and Industries building were
moved to the new Museum of History and Technology, where the hall
of numismatics was opened Friday, October 23, 1964. While the
layout differs in many respects from that previously used, the general
character of the exhibit remains the same. The exhibits trace the
evolution of money within a sequence of significant historical events
and show it as an integral part of the cultural development of human
society. Additional features are the world’s largest collection of gold
coins on display and the famous United States Mint collection, which
had its inception in the late 18th century.

Among the special numismatic displays were “The Kennedy Half
Dollar,” with original mint models and designs made available by the
United States Mint; ‘‘The Austrian Empire and Its Currencies,” an
historical exhibit made possible by a recent donation from Mortimer
and Anna Neinken; and “‘A Selection of Contemporary Artistic Medals
from Europe,” featuring prominent artists from France, Germany,
Greece, and Italy.

The Reifenberg collection, illustrating Israel’s ancient history through
its coins, was displayed from November 1964 through January 1965.
Starting with two exceedingly rare pieces struck in Judaea under
Persian rule, the exhibit, featuring a virtually complete series of ancient
Judaean coins, was made possible through the cooperation of Mrs.
Esther Reifenberg of Jerusalem, and Mr. M. Avida, Director, Cultural
Relations Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Jerusalem,
Israel. .

A temporary display, arranged through the courtesy of the Argentina
Mint, illustrated coins and paper currencies of Argentina and included
master hubs for the silver peso of 1881, Argentina’s first national coin;
the original model for the Liberty-head appearing on many of its
coins; a wooden block for the 1000-peso banknote—the first issue made
at the Buenos Aires Mint in 1889; as well as color proofs for projects
of banknotes.

The first international numismatic display ever held in the United
States was organized by V. Clain-Stefanelli in August 1964, on the
occasion of the convention of the American Numismatic Association
in Cleveland. The displays from 20 countries represented contribu-
tions from 41 exhibitors.
138 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1965—-MUSEUM OF HISTORY & TECHNOLOGY

The hall of philately and postal history was opened September 18,
1964, after ceremonies at which more than 500 guests were addressed
by assistant postmaster general Ralph Nicholson and James Conlon,
chief, currency and stamp manufacturing, Bureau of Engraving and
Printing. The new exhibits include more than 70 major units dealing
with the history of the world’s posts, United States stamp production,
transportation of the mails, United States and foreign postal stationery,
and the history of revenue stamps and stamped paper. Among them
are a comprehensive selection of stamps of the world from the national
collection, exhibited in 473 pull-out frames; the re-creation of a country-
store post office, ca. 1880, furnished with original equipment and fix-
tures; 15th- and 16th-century correspondence carried by the posts of
the Republic of Venice; papyrus letters from Egypt; and a cover with its
enclosure, carried by John Wise in his balloon Jupiter in 1859 from
Lafayette, Ind., on the first attempt to transport mail by air under
authorization of postal officials. The new hall, developed under
former curators George T. Turner and Francis J. McCall and the pres-
ent associate curator in charge, Carl H. Scheele, is the only permanent
exhibition in the United States which presents a comprehensive and
large-scale survey of postal history and stamp production.

A special exhibition of stamps from the Federal Republic of West
Germany was opened in April 1965 by His Excellency Heinrich
Knappstein, the German Ambassador. Postal issues of the recent
post-war period displayed included stamps honoring the late John F.
Kennedy and the German resistance to the Nazis during World War II.

Inclusion of a California post-gold-rush ranch-house kitchen in the hall
of every day life in the American past became possible when an appro-
priate room was found in Siskiyou County, Calif. Remarkable for never
having been disturbed since it was constructed about 1862, and for
bearing its original blue paint, the kitchen of tongue-and-groove
boards was dismantled by George H. Watson, specialist in the restora-
tion of old structures, and his assistant, Charles H. Rowell. Not only
was the interior woodwork removed, but also the peeled cedar post
rafters and pine roofers from the roof overhead and the heavy pine
floor joists and stone piers supporting them. All were reconstructed in
the exhibit hall by Watson and his crew so that the visitor views the
room with its structure above and below, as though looking into a
cross-section of the house. The kitchen is equipped with furnishings
and utensils of the period collected in California and originally used
there. On the other side of the kitchen is a temporary exhibit, “The
Chinese in California,’ and nearby are prints and paintings lent by
Joan Pearson Watkins. The kitchen and its associated exhibits, con-
EXHIBITS 139

ceived and planned by C. Malcolm Watkins, were opened on May 7,
1965, with a ceremony and reception sponsored jointly by the Cali-
fornia State Society of D.C. and the Smithsonian. For this occasion,
the historic gold nugget found by James Marshall at Sutter’s Mill,
which inspired the great California gold rush, was specially exhibited.

An exhibit of furniture from the Surrender Room of the McLean
House at Appomattox, Va., marked the 100th anniversary of the
surrender on April 9, 1865. An exhibition, opened May 29, 1965,
marking the 200th anniversary of the Virginia Resolves against the
Stamp Act, includes sections on the passage of the Stamp Act, the
colonial reaction to it, and its eventual repeal. The exhibit will con-
tinue into the bicentennial years of these events, through 1965 into
1966.

“The Victorian American,” a temporary exhibit of prints from the
Harry T. Peters lithography collection, was organized by Peter C.
Welsh to illustrate the national character of Americans during the
Victorian era.

ARMED FORCES HISTORY

Completion of exhibits for the armed forces halls has occupied the
entire staff of the department.

The preparation of General George Washington’s headquarters tent,
a unique specimen in an excellent state of preservation, considering its
age, proved an unusual and exacting task (cleaning, repairing, and
preparing the tent itself for exhibition are described on p. 125). An
undertent of unchemically treated linen was constructed and mounted
over a chemically inert metal frame. The original tent was then placed
over the whole with no resultant stress on any seams or fibers. One
end of the tent was opened to present a period-room display using con-
temporary camp furniture and objects. The whole was enclosed in a
glass case.

Completion of the extensive exhibit of the Continental gondola
Philadelphia marked a memorable stage in the long history of that re-
markable relic of the American Revolution. A system of ramps and
protective railings enables visitors to view this heavily armed gunboat
from all elevations, while ensuring her physical security. Nearby are
cases of artifacts recovered from the Philadelphia site on Lake Champlain,
as well as a series of maps illustrating Benedict Arnold’s Northern Cam-
paign of 1776, in which this historic man-of-war served.
Visitor Services

An important and extensive program for utilizing the Museum’s
ancient instruments in a series of concerts was initiated by Mrs. Cynthia
Adams Hoover. In these activities she has been assisted by museum
specialist Jay Scott Odell.

Winter concert activities included a program of music of the 1860’s
played on brass instruments of that period from the collections. The
musical arrangements were taken directly from the band books of the
Third New Hampshire Regiment of the period (at popular request,
this music was played again in a concert on the Mall). The English
Consort of Viols played at the Smithsonian in November. The con-
cert by Frans Brueggen, recorder, and Gustav Leonhardt, playing on
the Museum’s restored 1745 Dulcken harpsichord, was considered by
local music critics as one of the highlights of the Washington musical
year. In December, the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress
were hosts to the national meetings of the American Musicological
Society and the College Music Society, for which a concert featuring
Carissimi’s Oratorio “‘Jonas” was arranged.

Music on the Mall was initiated in May on the Museum’s terrace
with the National Symphony Orchestra. ‘The Honorable Adlai Steven-
son, Ambassador to the United Nations, narrated Aaron Copland’s
“Lincoln Portrait,’ and the young pianist André Watts played Saint-
Saens’ Concerto No. 2. Tower music was a weekly feature in summer.
Played by five wind musicians from the top of the north portico of the
Renwick-designed Smithsonian building, it began the summer ‘Tuesday
evening music series in early June. These new developments have
materially changed the atmosphere of the Mall lying between the
Smithsonian’s buildings. Mrs. Hoover collaborated in the extensive
research leading to the design and construction of a new music platform
and background shell for the outdoor concerts on the terrace.

Several lectures and forums were sponsored in the department of
civil history. Stella Mary Newton, advisor to the restoration depart-
ment of the National Gallery, London, gave a lecture ‘‘Social Impli-
cations in the Costumes in Hogarth’s Paintings.”” John Harris, keeper
of drawings of the Royal Institute of British Architects, lectured on
‘William Kent.’ Scott Symons, formerly assistant-curator-in-charge
of the Canadiana collections, The Royal Ontario Museum, lectured
publicly on “French Canadiana Versus the American Dream” and
gave an intramuseum seminar on the same subject. (Mr. Symons also
spent three weeks in residence as a visiting scholar studying the
Museum’s furniture collections.)

VISITOR SERVICES 141

In association with the Naval Historical Foundation, the division
of naval history inaugurated an annual series of lectures on naval and
maritime history. In November 1964, the noted German naval
historian Vizeadmiral Friedrich C. Ruge presented an illustrated
lecture, “Rommel and the Invasion of Western Europe, 1944,” before
a capacity audience of military and naval historians. As former
naval advisor to the colorful field marshal, Ruge described Rommel’s
dogged but unsuccessful efforts to concentrate German armored
strength on the Normandy coast on the eve of Operation ‘“‘Overlord.”
In March 1965, the division again joined with the Foundation in
sponsoring a lecture, ‘““The Defense of Trade in World Wars I and
II,”’ by the distinguished British historian, Captain Stephen W. Roskill,
R.N. Drawing not only upon his voluminous official history, The
War at Sea, but also on his recent researches on British naval policy
between the wars, Roskill analyzed the nigh-disastrous Allied under-
estimation of a renewed U-boat threat in 1939 and presented a critical
evaluation of the role once again played by the convoy system in
safeguarding Allied sea communications.

International Exchange Service
J. A. Cotiins, Chief

The original plan of organization of the Smithsonian Institution
provided for a system of exchange of current publications which would
afford the Smithsonian Institution the most ready means of entering
into friendly relations and correspondence with all the learned societies
in the world and of enriching the Smithsonian library with the current
transactions and proceedings of foreign institutions.

When the first of the Smithsonian’s long series of scientific publica-
tions was issued, copies were sent to scientific and learned institutions
abroad. In return, the Smithsonian Institution received many
valuable publications from foreign institutions. To continue this de-
sirable international exchange of scientific information, the Smithso-
nian Institution appointed agents in a number of foreign countries to
distribute the publications received from the Smithsonian Institution
and to forward to the Smithsonian Institution the publications received
from the foreign institutions.

In 1851 the privilege of transmitting publications through the
Smithsonian Institution to other countries, and of receiving publica-
tions from foreign institutions in return, was extended to other insti-
tutions in the United States. This opportunity to distribute their
publications abroad was eagerly accepted and the system grew so
rapidly that today most Government agencies, many universities,
and scientific organizations representing every State in the Union
utilize the International Exchange Service.

Among the many colleges and universities transmitting publications
through the Service during the past fiscal year were the following:
University of California, Columbia University, Cornell University,
Harvard College, University of Illinois, Indiana University, University
of Kansas, University of Michigan, University of Oregon, University
of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, University of Texas, University
of Virginia, and Yale University.

In fiscal year 1965, the International Exchange Service received for
transmission 989,779 pounds of publications from foreign and domestic
sources. This was a slight decrease from the preceding year. Of the
amount received, 115,537 pounds were from foreign sources for dis-
tribution to addressees in the United States. A strike of the long-
shoremen on the east coast of the United States affected the operation

of the Service from the middle of December 1964 until March 1965.
Another strike in June by the Maritime unions against some of the
steamship lines delayed the forwarding of publications to many countries.

Publications were received from more than 350 different organizations,
institutions, Government bureaus, Congressional committees, agricul-
tural experiment stations, and individuals during the year for trans-
mission to more than 100 different countries.

Publications weighing 624,125 pounds, 70 percent of the total
weight received for transmission abroad, were forwarded by ocean
freight at a cost to the Smithsonian Institution of $36,856, or approx-
imately 5.9 cents per pound.
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE 147

Addressed packages of publications are mailed directly to the intended
addressees in the countries that do not have exchange bureaus. During
the past fiscal year packages of addressed publications weighing 259,354
pounds—30 percent of the total weight received for transmission
abroad—were mailed to the intended addressees at a cost to the Smith-
sonian Institution of $61,039, or approximately 23.5 cents per pound.

Listed below are the names of the foreign exchange bureaus to which
the International Exchange Service forwards addressed packages of
publications for distribution to the intended recipients.
