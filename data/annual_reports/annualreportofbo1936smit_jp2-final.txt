REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

C. G. ABBOT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 20, 1936

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and the
Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1936. The first 16 pages contain a summary
account of the affairs of the Institution, and appendixes 1 to 10 give
more detailed reports of the operations of the National Museum, the
National Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of
American Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National
Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the Division of
Radiation and Organisms, the Smithsonian library, and of the publi-
cations issued under the direction of the Institution. On page 97 is
the financial report of the executive committee of the Board of
Regents.

OUTSTANDING EVENTS

Notable progress has been made by the Institution in its varied
fields of endeavor. Continuation of the study of the relation of our
weather to changes in the sun’s radiation led to apparent proof that
the short-interval changes of solar radiation are of major influence
on the weather for the following 2 weeks. Funds to establish seven
additional observing stations to test this promising method of weather
forecasting were provided in a bill passed by the Senate, but unfor-'
tunately the item was lost in conference. The Division of Radiation
and Organisms has determined specifically the efficiency of different
wave lengths of radiation in promoting photosynthesis and photo-
tropism, and has developed new types of research apparatus of un-
equaled adaptability and power. The Institution published the latest
results of the high-altitude rocket experiments of Dr. R. H. Goddard,
whose early work was supported for 12 years by the Smithsonian.
In his most recent trial flights the liquid-propelled rocket attained a
height of 7,500 feet, its automatic stabilizer keeping the flight verti-
cal. With the P. W. A. grant reported last year, three new modern

t
Dy ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

exhibition buildings are under construction at the National Zoological
Park and are expected to be completed by January 1937.

Toward the end of the year a weekly radio program on the activi-
ties of the Smithsonian Institution was put on the air by the Office
of Education, Department of the Interior, in cooperation with the
National Broadcasting Company. The program consists of weekly
half-hour dramatizations of science and art over a Nation-wide
hook-up. The mail response from listeners has been enthusiastic.
The sales of the Smithsonian Scientific Series, a set of 12 popular
science volumes written by members of the Smithsonian staff and
collaborators, have continued to increase until at the present time a
total of nearly $150,000 has been received by the Institution in royal-
ties for the furtherance of its researches. In the will of the late
Dr. William L. Abbott, long a collaborator and friend of the Institu-
tion, a one-fifth share of his residuary estate was left to the Smith-
sonian to promote zoological researches. The executors state that
this share will be in the neighborhood of $100,000.

The Institution has continued its work on the problem of Folsom
man through the investigations of Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, Jr., near
Fort Collins, Colo. Additional information has been obtained on!
this earliest known American aboriginal culture, as well as further
evidence of the contemporaneity of Folsom man with extinct species
of bison. In Alaska Dr. AleS Hrdlicka and Henry B. Collins, work-
ing independently, have continued to seek for direct evidence of the
ancient migration of the American Indians from Asia, with valuable
results.

Outstanding among the year’s publications were: Solar Radiation
and Weather Studies and The Dependence of Terrestrial Tempera-
tures on the Variations of the Sun’s Radiation, by C. G. Abbot,
summarizing his investigations on the relationship of our weather
to variation in the sun’s radiation; An Introduction to Nebraska
Archeology, by William Duncan Strong, a monographic work on
the archeology of that important region; and Molluscan Intermedi-
ate Hosts of the Asiatic Blood Fluke, Schistosoma japonicum, and
Species Confused with Them, by Paul Bartsch, a definitive classifi-
cation of the intermediate hosts of this human parasite, which(
affects millions of Orientals, particularly the Chinese. Suggestions
for its control are included.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF THE
INSTITUTION

National Museum.—¥or the maintenance of the National Museum
the total appropriations were $760,742, an increase of $44,671 over
those for 1935. Additions to the collections numbered 486,581 speci-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

mens, coming mostly as gifts or as the result of Smithsonian expedi-
tions. Perhaps the most outstanding single accessions in the various
departments of the Museum were as follows: In anthropology, the
Richard K. Peck collection of materials representing the Negritos
and Papuans of Dutch New Guinea, the Dyaks of Borneo, and the
Jivaro of Ecuador; in biology, an accession of 465 mammals from
Africa, Asia, and South America, representing 300 forms not previ-
ously contained in the collections, by exchange from the Field
Museum of Natural History; in geology, a notable series of Chilean
minerals, including six new species, collected by Mark Bandy; in
arts and industries, the airplane Winnie Mae, flown by Post and
Gatty and later by Post alone in various record flights, purchased
through special Congressional appropriation. A number of field
expeditions went out during the year, financed mainly by Smith-
sonian private funds. Visitors to the various Museum buildings
numbered 1,973,673. There were published 1 annual report, 11
Proceedings papers, and 1 paper in the series Contributions from
the National Herbarium.

National Gallery of Art.—A large part of the year’s work related
to the care, protection, and restoration of paintings belonging to the
Government. In the interests of the better preservation of works of
art and of better working conditions, an air-conditioning unit was
installed in the storage workroom. At the 15th annual meeting of
the National Gallery of Art Commission on December 10, 1935, the
death of Joseph H. Gest, chairman, was announced, and Charles L.
Borie, Jr., was elected chairman. A number of portraits and other art
works were accepted by the Commission for the Gallery. Four minia-
tures were acquired through the Catherine Walden Myer fund. The
Gallery held eight special exhibitions, as follows: National and inter-
national high school art; intagho prints and etchings by members of
the Chicago Society of Etchers; miniatures by members of the Ameri-
can Society of Miniature Painters; paintings and etchings by Mons
Breidvik; portraits by Bjorn P. Egeli; vitreous enamels by Frances
and Richard McGraw; the First Annual Metropolitan State Art Con-
test; and paintings by children receiving free art instruction in the
New York area.

Freer Gallery of Art.—The year’s additions to the collection include
a Persian brass box, four Chinese bronzes, and a sculptured Persian
pediment, all shown in plates 1 and 2. There were also added four
leaves from a sixteenth century Persian manuscript, two Indian and
three Persian paintings, and in pottery one Chinese cup and a Syro-
Egyptian bowl. Curatorial work was devoted to the study of Chinese,
Japanese, Armenian, Arabic, Persian, and East Indian objects and of
the texts and seals associated with them. During the year 673 objects

and 225 photographs of objects were submitted to the curator for an
112059372
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

opinion as to their identity, meaning, or historical or esthetic signifi-
cance, and 18 inscriptions for translation. Visitors totaled 123,418,
and 96 groups were given docent service. A course of four lectures on
Persian Painting was given at the Gallery by Eustache de Lorey,
former Director of the French Institute of Arts and Archaeology, and
19 lectures and illustrated talks were given by members of the Gallery
staff at Columbia University and at the Gallery.

Bureau of American E'thnology.—The researches of the Bureau on
the American Indians included archeological and ethnological studies
in Washington, in many other parts of the United States, in Canada,
and in Central America. In the field of archeology, aid was given in
establishing two P. W. A. projects at two important old sites in
Florida; further investigation of the problem of Folsom man was
carried out through excavations at the Lindenmeier site in northern
Colorado; a joint Smithsonian-Peabody Museum expedition made
important archeological discoveries in Honduras, notably that of a
culture level apparently ancestral to that of the Maya. The year’s
ethnological investigations included linguistic studies of the Timucua
and of the Indians of James and Hudson Bays, Canada; study of the
Mission Indians of California; field work among the Shoshoni, Ban-
nock, and Gosiute Indians of Utah, Nevada, and Idaho; studies of the
League of the Iroquois; and researches on Florida Indian music. The
Bureau published an annual report and two bulletins.

International eachanges.——The exchange service is the official
United States agency for the exchange with other countries of gov-
ernmental and scientific documents. In carrying out this important
work of aiding in the interchange of scientific thought among the
nations of the world, the exchange service handled during the year a
total of 596,951 packages weighing 618,789 pounds. The number of
full and partial sets of governmental publications forwarded abroad
is now 111, and 102 copies of the Congressional Record are sent to
other countries in exchange for their parliamentary journals. The
Exchange Agency in Peru, formerly conducted under the Ministerio
de Fomento, Lima, is now under the jurisdiction of the Ministerio
de Relaciones Exteriores, the Seccién de Propaganda y Publicaciones
in Lima carrying on the work. The agency for the Union of South
Africa has been removed from Pretoria, Transvaal, to Capetown,
Cape of Good Hope.

National Zoological Park.—Under a grant from the P. W. A. of
$680,000, supplemented later by $191,575, work was begun during the
year on five projects, namely, machine and carpenter shops and a
garage; installation of three 250-h.p. boilers which will heat all exhi-
bition buildings except the bird house; a building for small mammals
and great apes; a building for large animals such as elephant, rhi-
noceros, and hippopotamus; and a new wing on the bird house.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

With the completion of these projects, the Zoo will have four large
modern exhibition buildings, and the new construction constitutes the
greatest improvement in the history of the Park. Assignment of
P. W. A. labor also enabled the Park to carry out a considerable
number of lesser improvements, including work on roads, grounds,
and buildings. Accessions of animals numbered 786. Losses by
death and otherwise totalled 765, leaving the collection at the close
of the year at 2,191 animals, representing 675 different species. Vis-
itors numbered 2,235,850, including groups from 579 schools and
organizations from 20 States and the District of Columbia.

Astrophysical Observatory.—Measurements of the solar constant of
radiation have been continued on every possible day at the three
Smithsonian stations at Table Mountain, Calif., Montezuma, Chile,
and Mount St. Katherine, Egypt. The irregularity of the results at
Table Mountain led to the development of a criterion for distinguish-
ing unfavorable sky conditions, which will provide a new increase in
the accuracy of measurement of the solar variability. Two papers
published by Dr. Abbot appear to prove that the short-interval
changes of solar radiation are of major influence on the weather for
the ensuing 2 weeks or more. To test the use of this relationship in
weather forecasting, seven additional observing stations are required.
An amendment to the Urgent Deficiency Act providing the necessary
funds was passed by the Senate, but was rejected in conference with
the House. Preliminary studies were begun of the possibility of
automatic determination of solar variability from sounding balloons.

Division of Radiation and Organisms.—The Division’s investiga-
tions comprised the following: Continuation of work on the depend-
ence of carbon dioxide assimilation in wheat upon the wave length
of radiation ; experiments on the effects of ultraviolet rays on algae;
experiments on the effects of light of different wave lengths on
growth of tomatoes; development of an extremely sensitive and
quick-acting spectroscopic method for measuring carbon dioxide con-
centration; study of the dependence of photosynthesis in wheat on
time factors; and the development of a highly sensitive thermo-
couple of great ruggedness.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore,
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

constituted an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the
executive departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The terms of the three Members of the House of Representatives
on the Board of Regents, Representatives T. Alan Goldsborough, of
Maryland; Charles L. Gifford, of Massachusetts; and Clarence
Cannon, of Missouri, expired on December 25, 1935, and on January
9, 1936, they were reappointed by the Speaker of the House for the
statutory term of 2 years. Mr. Frederic A. Delano, of Washington,
D. C., whose term as a citizen Regent expired January 21, 1935, was
reappointed for another 6 years by Joint Resolution of Congress
approved August 7, 1935. By Joint Resolution of Congress ap-
proved February 21, 1936, Dr. Roland S. Morris, of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, was appointed to fill the existing vacancy in the class
of citizen Regents.

The roll of Regents at the close of the year was as follows:
Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, Chan-
cellor; John N. Garner, Vice President of the United States; mem-
bers from the Senate—Joseph T. Robinson, M. M. Logan, Charles L.
McNary; members from the House of Representatives—T. Alan
Goldsborough, Clarence Cannon, Charles L. Gifford; citizen mem-
bers—Frederic A. Delano, Washington, D. C.; John C. Merriam,
Washington, D. C.; R. Walton Moore, Virginia; Robert W. Bing-
ham, Kentucky; Augustus P. Loring, Massachusetts; Roland S.
Morris, Pennsylvania.

Proceedings—The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was
held on January 16, 1936. The Regents present were Chief Justice
Charles Evans Hughes, Chancellor; Senators Joseph T. Robinson
and M. M. Logan; Representatives Charles L. Gifford and Clarence
Cannon; citizen Regents Frederic A. Delano, Augustus P. Loring;
and the Secretary, Dr. Charles G. Abbot.

The Board elected Senator McNary a member of the Permanent
Committee.

The Secretary presented his annual report, detailing the activities
of the several Government branches and of the parent Institution
during the year, and Mr. Delano presented the report of the Execu-
tive Committee, covering financial statistics of the Institution. The
Secretary also presented the annual report of the National Gallery
of Art Commission.

In his usual special] report the Secretary briefly reviewed outstand-
ing events of the year, and Assistant Secretary Wetmore detailed
important activities in the National Museum.

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST

SMITHSONIAN RADIO PROGRAM

A new means of carrying on the diffusion of knowledge was made
available to the Institution toward the end of the fiscal year, when
the Office of Education, Department of the Interior, began, as a
feature of the Radio Project of the Works Progress Administration,
a series of weekly half-hour radio broadcasts, on a Nation-wide
hook-up, on the activities of the Smithsonian Institution. These
broadcasts, which constitute an innovation in the field of educational
radio programs, take the form of dramatizations of the scientific
research, exploration, museum exhibits, and art activities carried on
under the Institution’s direction. They form an N. B. C. blue net-
work feature on Sunday mornings at 11:30 Eastern daylight saving
time (red network, 11:30 Eastern standard time after September
27), and are presented through the cooperation of the National
Broadcasting Co.

The first broadcast, produced on Sunday, June 7, 1936, dramatized
the founding of the Smithsonian Institution and the stories of some
of the famous exhibits in the Arts and Industries Building of the
United States National Museum, including Colonel Lindbergh’s
Spirit of St. Louis, the Star Spangled Banner, the first Atlantic cable,
and Alexander Graham Bell’s early télephones. This, with the 18
other broadcasts listed below, were to comprise the first series:

From the beginning this program has been enthusiastically re-
ceived. Hundreds of letters were received at the Office of Education
commending the dramatized form of educational broadcast as being
both entertaining and instructive, and I may anticipate the next fiscal
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

year by saying that at the writing of this report in the early fall of
1936 the mail response had increased to an average of over 2,000 let-
ters a week. A large number of the letters come from teachers and
others particularly interested in education, many of whom state that
the informative material contained in the dramatized stories of re-
search, exploration and art, and in the advance summaries mailed out
to those requesting them, is of real, practical use in their work.

The Institution is grateful to the Office of Education and to the
National Broadcasting Co. for making possible this effective means
of disseminating knowledge in the fields of science and art.

ROCKET EXPERIMENTS OF DR. R. H. GODDARD

For 12 years—from 1916 to 1928—the Institution supported
through annual grants Dr. R. H. Goddard’s investigations on rocket
flight, with the primary purpose of supplying a means of exploring
the unknown upper atmosphere. Dr. Goddard’s pioneering researches
on the design of the rocket itself and on the most effective rocket fuel
and the means of utilizing it in the rocket led to a successful trial
flight in July 1929, and in my annual report for 1930 I said:

The apparently assured success of Dr. Goddard’s experiments has drawn
support from a source better equipped financially to provide it than the Smith-
sonian, The late Simon Guggenheim, at Colonel Lindbergh’s suggestion, made
a large grant of funds and set up an advisory committee, of which the Secretary,
Dr. Abbot, is a member. Dr. Goddard’s experiments are now going on under
these auspices in New Mexico. It is a pleasure to record here that the Smith-
sonian has again been able to support during its more or less uncertain pioneer-
ing stages an investigation of great promise for the increase of knowledge.

Dr. Goddard has continued to advance the development of his
liquid-propellant rocket with marked success, and early in 1936 he
made a report on these later researches to the Daniel and Florence
Guggenheim Foundation. From this report, which was published by
the Smithsonian Institution on March 16, 1986, it will be of interest to
quote a few paragraphs:

Inasmuch as control by a small gyroscope is the best as well as the lightest
means of operating the directing vanes, the action of the gyroscope being inde-
pendent of the direction and acceleration of the rocket, a gyroscope having the
necessary characteristics was developed after numerous tests.

The gyroscope was set to apply controlling force when the axis of the rocket
deviated 10° or more from the vertical. In the first flight of the present series
of tests with gyroscopic control, on March 28, 1935, the rocket as viewed from
the 1,000-foot shelter traveled first to the left and then to the right, thereafter
describing a smooth and rather flat trajectory. * * *

In subsequent flights, with adjustments and improvements in the stabilizing
arrangements, the rockets have been stabilized up to the time propulsion ceased,
the trajectory being a smooth curve beyond this point. * * * ‘The oscilla-
tions each side of the vertical varied from 10° to 30° and occupied from 1 to 2
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

seconds. Inasmuch as the rockets started slowly, the first few hundred feet of
the flight reminded one of a fish swimming in a vertical direction. * * *

The continually increasing speed of the rockets, with the accompanying steady
roar, make the flights very impressive. In the two flights the rocket left a
smoke trail and had a small, intensely white flame issuing from the nozzle,
which at times nearly disappeared with no decrease in roar or propelling force.
The occasional white flashes below the rocket are explosions of gasoline vapor
in the air.

In the flight of October 14, 1935, the rocket rose 4,000 feet; in the flight of
May 31, 1935, it rose 7,500 feet. * * *

As in the flights of 1930-32 to study rocket performance in the air, no attempt
was made in the flights of 1984-85 to reduce the weight of the rockets, which
varied from 58 to 85 pounds. A reduction of weight would be useless before a
vertical course of the rocket could be maintained automatically. The speed of
700 miles per hour, although high, was not as much as could be obtained by a
light rocket, and the heights also were much less than could be obtained by a
light rocket of the same power.

It is worth mentioning that inasmuch as the delicate directional apparatus
functioned while the rockets were in flight, it should be possible to carry record-
ing instruments on the rocket without damage or changes in adjustment.

The next step in the development of the liquid-propellant rocket is the reduc-
tion of weight to a minimum. Some progress along this line has already been
magde;c =

The chief accomplishments to date are the development of a combustion cham-
ber, or rocket motor, that is extremely light and powerful and can be used
repeatedly, and of a means of stabilization that operates automatically while
the rocket is in flight.

WALTER RATHBONE BACON TRAVELING SCHOLARSHIP

DR. MOZLEY’S MOLLUSK INVESTIGATIONS

The Walter Rathbone Bacon Traveling Scholarship of the Smith-
sonian Institution granted to Dr. Alan Mozley for 1932 and 1933 for
field studies of land and fresh-water mollusks in northern Asia, in
order to correlate these with similar researches which he had made in
the far north of North America, was extended for an additional sea-
son to permit the gathering of further data. This is the first report
it has been possible to present on Dr. Mozley’s later work.

Dr. Mozley intended to make a trip down the Lena River and to
explore this stream and adjacent territory before attempting a final
report, but for certain reasons it was not practicable for him to obtain
the necessary permission for work in this territory. He therefore,
with the sanction of the authorities of the Smithsonian Institution,
shifted his field of exploration to Finland and northern Sweden, using
Alvsky, Kabdalis, Ostersund, Strémsund, Sveg, Orsa, Mora, Alvdalen,
and Stockholm as bases for his quest.

At the close of the collecting season Dr. Mozley revisited England,
where he continued museum studies of his catches, after which he
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

returned to the United States National Museum for his final endeay-
ors. These are in part embodied in a paper entitled “The Fresh-
Water and Terrestrial Mollusca of Northern Asia”, published in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. 58, pt. 3, no. 24,
pp. 605-695, pls. 1-5, figs. 1-8, 1935-36. In this he describes the
species collected by him and discusses their ecologic relationship.

The region embraced in this work includes the greater part of con-
tinental Asia north of latitude 50°, excepting outer Mongolia and
Manchuria, and the Lake Baikal area with its peculiar fauna. In
the region covered 67 species and subspecies were obtained and exam-
ined in detail. A certain number of forms are held in abeyance, to
be discussed in a final report, upon the preparation of which Dr.
Mozley is now engaged.

DR. BLACK WELDER’S STUDY OF THE STAPHYLINID FAUNA OF THE WEST INDIES

The Walter Rathbone Bacon Scholarship was awarded in June
1935 to Dr. Richard E. Blackwelder, of Stanford University, Cali-
fornia. In his application for this scholarship the successful candi-
date indicated that his project should consist of a study of the
staphylinid fauna of the West Indies, with especial reference to the
subfamily Tachyporinae.

Accordingly Dr. Blackwelder set sail from New York late in June
and commenced the field work necessary for the completion of the
project. In succession he has visited the islands of Jamaica, Gaude-
loupe, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Antigua, St. Thomas, Trinidad, To-
bago, Grenada, Caracou, St. Vincent, Union, Barbados, St. Lucia,
Martinique, Dominica, Montserrat, Antigua, and St. Kitts. Depend-
ing upon the size of the islands and the opportunities for collecting,
Dr. Blackwelder has spent a longer or shorter time on each of these
islands.

During the coming 6 months the islands of the Greater Antilles
will be revisited, the second visit coming at a different time of year
from the first, in that way making it possible to get species which
were not found at the first attempt.

The results of his trip so far, as shown in his monthly reports, have
been gratifying, many thousands of Staphylinidae having been
already obtained, together with material in other groups of the animal
kingdom. Material other than Staphylinidae has been of the Coleop-
tera, arachnids, diplopods, chilopods, and birds.

At the end of his field work in the West Indies it is intended that
Dr. Blackwelder will return to Washington, there to prepare a series
of the species which he has collected and which he will take to the
British Museum for comparison with the types of described West
Indian species. Upon his return from the British Museum Dr. Black-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ti

welder will work over the entire collection and prepare a report upon
this group of insects.
GRANTS

Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratorium der Rijks-Universiteit te
Leiden.—In continuation of a number of previous grants to the
Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory, through its director, Prof. Dr. W. H.
Keesom, the Institution contributed $500 toward the support of
certain of the low-temperature researches now in progress at the
laboratory. At the suggestion of the Secretary, a like contribution
was also made by the Research Corporation of New York.

Dy, Erzsébet Kol—A grant of $700 was made to Dr. Erzsébet
Kol to enable her to study the biology of snow algae on the
snow fields and glaciers of Alaska. Dr. Kol, a botanist of Szeged,
Hungary, has come to this country through a fellowship from the
American Association of University Women to study the snow algae
on high mountains in the United States. The Smithsonian grant
will enable her to extend the work to include Alaska. Dr. Kol’s
studies in the field of cryobiology have covered a period of 10 years
and have included similar field work in the mountains of Switzer-
land, Norway, France, and Hungary.

Mount Washington Observatory—A small contribution of $50
was made toward the continued support of Mount Washington Ob-
servatory. This high-level observatory (6,284 ft.) in New Hamp-
shire is under direction of Dr. Charles F. Brooks, of the Harvard
Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory. Its observations are at times
the only upper air data available in the northeastern United States
in periods of general storm or fog. All phases of ice formation on
airplanes can readily be studied here on the ground, as the ice-
forming wind rushes by at airplane speeds.

FIFTH ARTHUR LECTURE

The fifth Arthur Lecture was given in the auditorium of the Na-
tional Museum February 25, 1936, by Dr. Earl S. Johnston, assistant
director of the Division of Radiation and Organisms, Smithsonian
Institution, under the title “Sun Rays and Plant Life.” Dr. John-
ston pointed out that the wide range in type of vegetation on the
earth is due to the great variation in the solar energy reaching our
planet. These variations relate to the duration, the intensity, and
the quality or wave length of sunlight. The lecturer discussed the
investigations by the Smithsonian Institution and other agencies of
the harmful and beneficial effects upon plant growth of specific wave
lengths of light.
{2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

The lecture will be published in the General Appendix to the 1936
Smithsonian Report.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EXHIBIT AT THE TEXAS CENTENNIAL
EXPOSITION, DALLAS, TEX.

The Smithsonian Institution exhibit at the Texas Centennial Ex-
position June 6 to November 30, 1936, was concerned wholly with a
presentation of the laboratory methods and processes involved in
the preparation and restoration of a fossil dinosaur skeleton and
with a picturization of the scientific knowledge of prehistoric rep-
tilian life derived from laboratory studies. The exhibit formed one
of aseries of scientific exhibits entitled “The Story of Life”, prepared
by the combined efforts of the United States Public Health Serv-
ice, the colleges and universities of Texas, and the Smithsonian
Institution.

The Smithsonian Institution exhibit occupied a rectangular bay,
the back wall of which was about 30 feet wide and the side walls of
which were, roughly, 30 feet and 20 feet, respectively, in length. A
railing prevented the visitors from approaching the rear wall closer
than 15 feet and the side walls 3 feet. There was thus made available
between the railing and the rear wall an area of approximately 15
feet by 30 feet for the carrying on of the regular laboratory work in
plain view of the visitor. Here daily during the course of the expo-
sition Norman H. Boss, chief preparator of the division of vertebrate
paleontology in the National Museum, and an assistant, Gilbert
Stucker, of Chicago, who was employed for the period of the exposi-
tion, carried on the intricate and varied work involved in working up
in relief parts of the Jurassic dinosaur Camarasaurus.

On the back wall of the working area there was mounted a full-size
line drawing of Camarasaurus and superposed on the drawing was
the original skull and the first five vertebrae, which had been pre-
pared in the National Museum laboratory prior to the exposition.
These original parts, together with those gradually exposed by the
preparators and the full-size profile drawing, gave the visitor a clear
idea of the complicated nature of the preparatory work in this
scientific field.

Five large masses of plaster-bandaged fossil in the rock, one weigh-
ing approximately 214 tons and another 114 tons, were shipped to
Dallas and constituted the working material during the exposition.
These masses are in the same form as received in 1923 by the United
States National Museum from the Dinosaur National Monument
quarry in Utah. The finished pieces were exhibited on available floor
space in the working area of the exhibit.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ie

Flanking the laboratory area there were exhibited two oil paintings
15 feet by 8 feet prepared by two Washington artists, Bruce Horsfall
and Garnet W. Jex, respectively. The Jex painting portrays rep-
tilian life in the Permian age of Texas. The Horsfall painting
visualizes Camarasaurus, the fossil skeleton of which was being pre-
pared, as he was supposed to have appeared in the flesh and in the
environment of his time, namely, the Jurassic age. Both paintings
were executed under the close supervision of C. W. Gilmore, curator
of vertebrate paleontology in the National Museum, and are as scien-
tifically correct in the topography, vegetation, and reptile restoration
as can be done with oil paint and brush.

In addition to the oil painting on the right flanking wall of the
area there was exhibited a well-executed diorama visualizing all
known life of the Jurassic age. This yielded to the visitor an under-
standing of the reptilian associates of the Camarasaurus in Jurassic
times and vividly indicated the swampy, moist character of the land
area of that distant time.

Thus the visitor to the Smithsonian Institution exhibit at the
Dallas exposition had revealed to him the manner in which the
Division of Vertebrate Paleontology in the United States National
Museum is acquiring scientific knowledge as to prehistoric life and
utilizing that information in the advancement of knowledge.

SMITHSONIAN SCIENTIFIC SERIES

The Smithsonian Scientific Series, a set of 12 volumes written in
popular style and profusely illustrated on the various branches of
science covered by the Institution’s research activities, was first put
on the market in 1928. In entering into the agreement for the sale
of this series, a departure from the normal free distribution of its
publications, the Institution had two aims in view, namely, the wider
diffusion of knowledge and the increase of its financial resources for
the promotion of research. The books are published and sold by a
private corporation of New York, the Smithsonian Institution Series,
Inc., and the Institution receives a royalty on all sales.

As the series has not been mentioned in my annual reports for the
past 2 years, it will be interesting to state the results of this enterprise
up to the close of the fiscal year 1936. From 1928, when the first set
was sold, to June 30, 1936, there have been sold a total of 12,917 sets.
In royalties, the Institution has received to date in the neighborhood
of $150,000, a definite proportion of which has been added to the
Institution’s permanent endowment, and the balance expended for
the most pressing scientific investigations. As the sales of the series
are continuing at an ever-increasing rate, the Institution’s endow-
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

ment funds will eventually be substantially augmented, with a corre-
sponding increase in the annual income for current researches.

BEQUESTS

William L. Abbott bequest—Dr. William L. Abbott, associate in
zoology since March 25, 1905, who had conducted and sponsored many
field expeditions for the Institution, died April 2, 19386. Under the
terms of Dr. Abbott’s will, the Smithsonian Institution is to receive,
in addition to any of his books and papers that they may desire,
one-fifth of his residuary estate. According to advices from the
executors of the estate, the Institution’s share will be in the neighbor-
hood of $100,000. This final expression of Dr. Abbott’s friendship is
very gratifying to the Institution, since he was one of its most valued
collaborators and had contributed materially to the upbuilding of its
biological and other collections.

Charles Dyke bequest—In the will of Charles Dyke, probated in
Corpus Christi, Tex., July 29, 1935, appears the following provision:

Item three: All the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate * * * I
give, devise, and bequeath to the Smithsonian Institute of Washington, District
of Columbia, to be used in founding and endowing a chair in some branch of
the Institution, to be designated as the branch of financial research, whose
purpose is to take steps to capitalize on any inventions, discoveries in research,
or through whatever other project seems most feasible. The aim of this bequest
is to enhance the endowment funds of this Institution to the highest degree
practicable in opulence through the efforts of said chair of financial research.

The Dyke estate is to remain in the hands of the executor during
the life of the first beneficiary, after which the legacy will be paid
to the Institution. Advice has been received from Mr. Dyke’s attor-
ney that the present value of the property is about $15,000.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

In the furtherance of its researches, the Institution sent out or
took part in 15 expeditions to a number of foreign countries as well
as to many localities in the United States. Dr. Charles W. Gilmore
collected rare vertebrate fossils in Montana and Wyoming. Dr.
Charles E. Resser studied the Cambrian rocks of the southern Appa-
lachian Mountains. Dr. G. Arthur Cooper established stratigraphic
correlations of Devonian rocks in the mid-western States and in New
York State. Mark C. Bandy collected mineral specimens in the
famous mineral localities of Chile. Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., studied the
fauna of the Florida Keys, with particular reference to the mammals
peculiar to that area. Dr. Doris M. Cochran investigated the am-
phibian life of Brazil. Dr. Waldo Schmitt, as a member of the
Hancock Pacific Expedition to the west coast of Central and South
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

America and the Galapagos Islands, collected specimens of marine
life. Capt. R. A. Bartlett led an expedition to the Arctic which
studied and collected the interesting marine life of the coasts of
Greenland. Dr. David C. Graham continued to collect specimens of
the mammal, bird, and insect fauna of little-known areas of
Szechwan, China.

Dr. AleS Hrdlitka continued his archeological excavations on
Kodiak Island, Alaska. Neil M. Judd visited many of the antiquities
of Mexico as a member of the United States delegation to the Seventh
American Scientific Congress. Herbert W. Krieger studied the early
Indian sites along the lower Potomac River in Maryland and Vir-
ginia. M. W. Stirling examined a number of ancient Maya sites in
Central America. Dr, F. H. H. Roberts, Jr., continued his investiga-
tions of Folsom man in northern Colorado. Dr. Truman Michelson
conducted Indian language studies of James and Hudson Bays,
Canada.

PUBLICATIONS

The several series of publications issued by the Institution and its
branches constitute its chief means of carrying on the “diffusion of
knowledge among men”, as stipulated by its founder, James Smith-
son. The majority of these publications are technical in character,
but many others are in popular demand, notably the Smithsonian
Annual Reports, which summarize scientific progress each year in
25 or 80 semi-popular articles by leading authorities; the bulletins
of the Bureau of American Ethnology on various phases of the study
of the Indians; and certain of the bulletins of the National Museum,
such as Bent’s volumes on life histories of North American birds.
The wider diffusion of scientific information has been aided in
recent years by a service of popular science news releases, based on
the researches of the Institution, which are widely used by leading
newspapers, and this year by a weekly radio program on Smith-
sonian activities put on the air by the United States Office of Educa-
tion in cooperation with the Institution’s editorial office.

It is gratifying to report that this year a portion of the printing
appropriation has been restored, so that it has been possible to resume
publication in a small way of the bulletins and proceedings of the
National Museum and the bulletins of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, all of which had been practically suspended for 3 years
because of drastically reduced printing appropriations. This sus-
pension overburdened the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, a
series supported by the limited private funds of the Institution, with
many papers which would normally have appeared in the other series.

The titles, authors, size, and date of appearance of all publica-
tions issued during the year are listed in the editor’s report, appen-
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

dix 10. It may be said here that a total of 70 volumes and pamphlets
were published; 54 of these were issued by the Institution proper,
13 by the National Museum, and 3 by the Bureau of American
Ethnology. The number of publications distributed was 124,359.

LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library comprises 10 major and 35 minor units,
which together contain a total of 860,000 volumes, pamphlets, and
charts. The new accessions for the year numbered 11,215, most of
these coming in exchange for the publications of the Institution and
its branches. Outstanding among the accessions received were the
semiprivate libraries of three of the members of the staff and associ-
ates of the Institution, namely, the invertebrate paleontology library
of Dr. E. O. Ulrich, the collection of works on orthoptera of the
late Dr. A. N. Caudell, and the anthropological library of the late
Dr. Walter Hough. The routine work of the staff included cata-
loging 7,015 publications, preparing and filing 55,829 cards, entering
25,205 periodicals, and making 11,235 loans, of which 281 were to
libraries outside the Smithsonian system. In addition, a large
amount of cataloging and carding was accomplished in connection
with the union catalog. The sorting, arranging, and labeling of the
collection of thousands of miscellaneous items that had accumulated
for years in the Smithsonian west stacks was practically finished,
with the result that hundreds of needed publications were brought
to light. It is significant in the growth of the library’s usefulness
that the staff was called on for even more reference and bibliographi-
cal service than usual, not only in connection with the Institution’s
own scientific work but also in response to inquiries from its
correspondents throughout the country.

Respectfully submitted.

C. G. Aspor, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1

REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL
MUSEUM

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the con-
dition and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1936:

Appropriations for the maintenance of the National Museum for
the year totaled $760,742, which was $44,671 more than for 1935.

COLLECTIONS

Material added to the collections during the year embodied a great
variety of valuable accessions, coming mostly as gifts from indi-
viduals interested in the Museum and from expeditions sponsored
by the Smithsonian. A total of 486,581 specimens were received,
comprising 1,784 separate accessions and distributed among the five
departments as follows: Anthropology, 4,856; biology, 263,705;
geology, 213,024; arts and industries, 2,281; and history, 2,715.

The more important of these accessions are summarized as follows:

Anthropology.—Outstanding among the ethnological material re-
ceived in the department of anthropology were the large Richard K.
Peck collection of weapons, costumes, and other articles illustrating
the decorative arts of the Negritos and Papuans of Dutch New Guinea
and of the Dyaks of Borneo; and specimens illustrating the culture
of the Jivaro Indians of Ecuador. In North American material the
Sioux, Hopi, and Navaho Indian tribes were represented. President
Franklin D. Roosevelt presented a collection of costumes, musical
instruments, and weapons from the Cuna and Tule Indians of south-
eastern Panama. There came also ethnologic artifacts from West and
South Africa, Australia, China, and Japan. The noteworthy Virgil
M. Hillyer collection of articles illustrating the history of lighting,
with an endowment to the Smithsonian of $7,000, was presented by
Mrs. Hillyer. Over 200 specimens were added to the collection of
musical instruments.

Of special interest among the archeological material received were
the following: 557 Paleolithic artifacts from Palestine collected by the
1934 joint expedition of the British School of Archeology in Palestine
and the American School of Prehistoric Research; several lots of
earthenware, stone, shell, and other artifacts from Alabama, Alaska,

17
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

Costa Rica, Puerto Rico; and over 1,100 archeological specimens from
Kodiak Island, Alaska, collected by Dr. A. Hrdlicka in 1984 and now
cataloged.

Skeletal material comprised about 500 specimens, mostly from
Kodiak Island and from prehistoric graves in Crimea.

Biology.—The Museum was singularly fortunate during the year
in acquiring older biological collections containing many type speci-
mens and otherwise important historical material that has served as
a basis for monographic studies by recognized authorities. Also
there was a marked increase in the number of species and genera
acquired not heretofore represented in the Museum.

In mammals the outstanding addition was 465 specimens from
Africa, Asia, and South America, representing approximately 300
forms not previously available in our collections. Important bird
specimens (skins and skeletons), many of them types, came from
Siam, Rhodesia, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Honduras, West Africa,
and Chile. There was added, in particular, a skin of the South
Trinidad petrel (Pterodroma arminjoniana), the first received in
North America. The largest accession of amphibians and reptiles
of the year comprised 1,600 specimens from several south-central
States collected by Dr. C. FE. Burt. The ichthyological collections
were enlarged by over 3,300 specimens, the most important single
one being a large sailfish caught off Cocos Island, Costa Rica, by
President Franklin D. Roosevelt and presented by him. Large
series of fishes came from the Amazon River, as well as a representa-
tive lot from Virginia. Noteworthy among the insect accessions
may be mentioned the valuable Bovie collection of weevils received
as a gift from L. L. Buchanan; the Beutenmiiller collection of
Cynipidae; 20,000 vials of ectoparasites of rodents received from the
National Institute of Health; the Alan S. Nicolay collection of
clerid beetles; 12,000 Chinese insects from the Rev. D. C. Graham;
and about 44,000 miscellaneous insects. Over 11,000 marine inverte-
brates of many kinds were added, including types of a number of new
species. The mollusks totaled over 50,000 specimens (including
13,135 collected by Dr. J. P. E. Morrison, of the Museum staff, dur-
ing several excursions into Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and
the Carolinas). Over 54,000 plant specimens were added from many
sources, outstanding among which was the large cactus collection of
the late David Griffiths.

Geology.—Important acquisitions in mineralogy were obtained,
as in former years, through the income from the Canfield, Roebling,
and Chamberlain funds. An outstanding collection of Chilean min-
erals, including what proved to be six new species, was made for the
Canfield collection by Mark Bandy. The Roebling collection was
enhanced by much new mineral material obtained from various
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

sources. Donated specimens and those received through exchange
comprised many valuable minerals from many parts of the world.

The total number of distinct meteorite representatives in the col-
lection was increased from 592 to 606 during the year. The most
important accession to the petrological collection was a series of
anorthosites, interesting rock types, from Norway.

In stratigraphic paleontology an important addition was about
100,000 specimens illustrating the Middle Devonian faunas of central
New York, collected by Dr. G. A. Cooper a number of years ago
and received in exchange from Colgate University. About 100,000
others, Middle Paleozoic rock specimens, came from Illinois, Indiana,
Towa, and Michigan.

Invertebrate fossils added represented Chile (Jurassic), Timor
(Permian), Portugal (Ordovician), Oklahoma (Carboniferous),
Florida (Miocene), and Hawaii (Pleistocene). The paleobotanical
collections were enriched by rare types of fossil cones from the Cre-
taceous of Maryland and the Eocene of North Dakota.

Field expeditions in vertebrate paleontology yielded the following
rarities: From Wyoming a nearly complete articulated skeleton of
the mammal Coryphodon, so far as known the second entire specimen
as yet found; from Montana articulated parts of the little-known
dinosaur Procheniosaurus, fragments of Leptoceratops, and an adult
skull of Brachyceratops. There were also added a nearly complete
skeleton of the edentate mammal Scelidodon capellini from South
America and the only known complete skull of the Oligocene lizard
Glyptosaurus giganieus.

Arts and industries —The outstanding accession in aeronautics was
the airplane Winnie Mae, flown by Wiley Post and Harold Gatty, and
subsequently by Post alone in various record flights, which was pur-
chased through funds provided by a special Congressional appropria-
tion. The airplane Polar Star, of exploration fame, used by Lincoln
Ellswerth in the first flight across Antarctica in November and De-
cember 1935, in an expedition sponsored by the National Geographic
Society, was received as a gift from Mr. Ellsworth. Propellers from
the airships Macon and Akron were transferred from the Navy De-
partment. The collection of scale models of aircraft was increased
by 14 specimens, including models of the following: The Short
Brothers’ airplane of 1911; the Breguet sesquiplane Point d’[nterro-
gation; the first plane built by Glenn Martin in 1909; a V-F-7-H;
and the Baby Clipper.

In mechanical technology the most important accession was the
original locomotive A ¢lantic, built at Baltimore in 1832, and the first
locomotive to enter the National Capital. A Ford model T touring
car of 1913, given by Harvey C. Locke, proved the most popular

112059—37——_3
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

transportation accession of the year. 'Two ship models were received
from President Roosevelt: One of the R. M. S. Mauretania and the
other of a modern seagoing trading junk of the island of Hainan,
China. Capt. John B. Harrison presented two models of Chesapeake
Bay vessels.

Other important specimens, to the number of 951, were added to the
collection of textiles, organic chemistry, wood technology, history of
agriculture, and medicine, as well as many valuable drawings, water
colors, photographs, prints, and photographic and printing equipment
to the division of graphic arts.

History.—Over 2,700 articles of historical and antiquarian value
were received, many of them pertaining to the lives and careers of
eminent Americans, such as Brand Whitlock, Maj. Gen. George A.
Custer, Maj. Gen. Adolphus W. Greely, and Rear Admiral Winfield
Scott Schley. Included also were 85 coins and 1,907 stamps for the
numismatic and philatelic series.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Work in a number of interesting fields of exploration was carried
forward during the year, mainly through grants from the income of
the invested funds of the Smithsonian Institution.

Anthropology—F rank M. Setzler, acting head curator, investi-
gated a large shell midden on St. Simons Island, Ga., at the request
of the Society for Georgia Archeology; he also made surface surveys
at other Georgia localities.

Under the joint auspices of the National Geographic Society and
the Smithsonian Institution, H. B. Collins, Jr., assistant curator of
ethnology, conducted archeological investigations of the prehistoric
Eskimo at Cape Wales, Alaska, pursuant to previous studies at Ber-
ing Strait, St. Lawrence Island, and Point Barrow.

H. W. Krieger, curator of ethnology, spent brief periods in the
study of aboriginal culture in tidewater Virginia and Maryland.

Dr. AleS Hrdhltka, curator of physical anthropology, spent the
summer of 1935 on Kodiak Island, Alaska, excavating at the same site
where he worked during previous years.

Biology.—Important biological work, supplementing that done in
previous years by Dr. H. M. Smith, was carried on in Siam under a
cooperative arrangement with H. G. Deignan, who forwarded a large
shipment of birds and mammals.

W. M. Perrygo, taxidermist, assisted by Carleton Lingebach, col-
lected birds and mammals in the Appalachian region, in an effort to
obtain for the Museum representative specimens for geographic dis-
tribution studies.

Dr. A. Wetmore, assistant secretary, made two collecting excursions
to White Top Mountain and one to Spruce Knob and other moun-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

tains in West Virginia, and obtained specimens of use in outlining
the local ranges of certain birds.

Dr. G. S. Myers, assistant curator of fishes, collected fishes in
Dismal Swamp and the Chowan-Roanoke River systems, in connec-
tion with a survey of Virginia fresh-water fishes begun in 1933.

Under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, the curator of
mollusks, Dr. Paul Bartsch, began some breeding experiments with
the mollusk Goniobasis virginica of the Potomac drainage, in an
attempt to ascertain the effect of different environmental conditions
on animals from the upper and lower parts of the river. Dr. J. P. E.
Morrison on his own initiative collected mollusks for the Museum
in the Blue Ridge and Shenandoah country.

Other biological field work included that of Austin H. Clark in a
study of Virginia butterflies, in which he made a preliminary survey
of 75 counties of the State; of P. W. Oman, who made an extensive
collection (about 40,000 specimens) of Homoptera in the West; of
KE. P. Killip, who collected plants on the Florida Keys; of Dr. C. E.
Burt, who continued his collecting for the Museum of herpetological
specimens from the south-central States; and of Dr. R. E. Black-
welder, holder of the Walter Rathbone Bacon Traveling Scholarship
of the Smithsonian Institution, who visited many of the islands of
the West Indies in a study of staphylinid beetles,

Geology—Mark C. Bandy spent four months in the Atacama
Desert region of Chile in the interests of the Museum mineral collec-
tions in cooperation with Harvard University.

At the end of the year Assistant Curator E. P. Henderson was col-
lecting in an extensive limestone contact zone on Prince of Wales
Island, Alaska.

Dr. G. A. Cooper, stratigraphic paleontologist, made a number of
field trips—to Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, as
well as the Midwest and Ontario—to obtain Middle Devonian rocks
and other geological specimens.

Dr. C. E. Resser, curator of stratigraphic paleontology, spent two
months in the southern Appalachians studying Cambrian geology.

The field explorations of vertebrate fossils under the direction of
C. W. Gilmore begun last year were continued, and collections were
made in the Two Medicine formation of Montana and the Wasatch of
the Big Horn Basin, Wyo., with good results.

Late in the year Dr. C. L. Gazin headed an expedition into the
vertebrate-fossil fields of New Mexico and Arizona.

MISCELLANEOUS

Visttors.—Visitors to the various Museum buildings during the year
totaled 1,973,673, an increase of 135,981 over last year and over 44,000
more than has ever before been recorded for a single year. The
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

212,031 visitors during August 1935 is the largest ever recorded for a
single month. The annual attendance in the several buildings was
recorded as follows: Smithsonian Building, 312,896; Arts and Indus-
tries Building, 873,533; Natural History Building, 635,561; Aircraft
Building, 151,683.

Publications —A small increase in the Museum allotment for print-
ing resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of papers
published. Thirteen publications were issued—the Annual Report,
11 Proceedings papers, and 1 number of the Contributions from the
National Herbarium. These are listed elsewhere in this report (ap-
pendix 10). Volumes and separates distributed during the year to
libraries and individuals throughout the world aggregated 33,936
copies.

Under direction of the Museum editor, Paul H. Oehser, a sizable
start has now been made on the long task of compiling the compre-
hensive index to Museum publications, now 3 years in progress. The
index now comprises about 183,500 cards and is complete through
Bulletin 47 (part 2) and Proceedings volume 17.

Assistance from work-relief agencies——Under supervision of the
curatorial staff of the Museum, a great deal of work was performed
during the year by personnel assigned to the Museum by the Federal
Art Project, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and the
Works Progress Administration, the latter two through the District of
Columbia Government. The work performed was chiefly as follows:
Checking, labeling, and repairing library material, preparing draw-
ings and photographs, typing, preparing and mounting specimens and
miscellaneous work on them, model making and repairing, labeling
and drafting, translating, and work on plaster casts. The work
ageregated 28,572 man-hours.

Special exhibitions—Fifteen special exhibitions were held during
the year under the auspices of various scientific, educational, and Gov-
ernment agencies, including, among others, the Association of Federal
Architects, Washington Philatelic Society, Center of Inter-American
Studies of George Washington University, District of Columbia
Dental Society, and Works Progress Administration.

Changes in organization and staff—Through a reorganization of
the fiscal offices of the Institution effective July 1, 1935, all fiscal work
was coordinated under the direction of N. W. Dorsey, accountant and
auditor. All fiscal matters pertaining to Museum appropriations are
now handled through Thomas F. Clark, assistant accountant and
auditor. Frank M. Setzler, assistant curator of archeology, was
advanced to the position of curator of anthropology on December 16,
1935, and at the same time was named acting head curator of the
department of anthropology. Paul S. Conger, of the Carnegie Insti-

ant property clerk. Floyd B. Kestner was appointed junior photog-
rapher on September 3, 1985; William E. Wade, undermechanic, was
promoted on September 1, 1935, to succeed George H. Sherwood as
assistant engineer; Joseph H. Boswell was transferred to the Museum
from the National Gallery of Art guard force on December 9, 1935,
to succeed H. G. Lugenbeel as principal guard in the Freer Gallery.

Carl W. Mitman, head curator of arts and industries, was desig-
nated as Smithsonian contact officer in connection with the Texas
Centennial Exposition; and Norman H. Boss, chief preparator in
vertebrate paleontology, as exhibits supervisor of this exhibit.

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1936:

In the last 12 months much of the business of the Gallery has related
to the care, protection, and restoration of paintings in the possession
of the Government. Six were cleaned, relined, and restored for the
United States National Museum. Forty-nine of the paintings in the
White House were cleaned, varnished, and protected; one was
mounted on masonite. The Harriet Lane Johnston paintings in the
Gallery were all cleaned, varnished, and covered at the back with
sisal kraft paper. Three of these were cleaned of varnish and care-
fully restored.

An air-conditioning unit for humidity and temperature control has
been installed in the storage workroom. The temperature is main-
tained at from 70° to 78°, and the relative humidity is held to a varia-
tion of about 2U percent, from 50 to 70 percent, which is a great
improvement over the conditions outside. In addition to the better
preservation of our paintings and works of art, it would seem that
the conditioned temperature and humidity would reduce the forma-
tion of mold and the activity of insects.

APPROPRIATIONS

For the administration of the National Gallery of Art by the
Smithsonian Institution, including compensation of necessary em-
ployees, purchase of books of reference and periodicals, traveling
expenses, uniforms for guards, and necessary incidental expenses,
$34,275.00 was appropriated, of which $16,153.34 was expended for
the care and maintenance of the Freer Gallery of Art, a unit of the
National Gallery.

THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The fifteenth annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art Com-
mission was held at the Smithsonian Institution on December 10, 1935.
The members present were: Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., vice chair-
man; Dr. Charles G. Abbot (ex officio), secretary ; and Herbert Adams,

W. Redfield, and Mahonri M. Young. Ruel P. Tolman, curator of
the division of graphic arts in the United States National Museum
and acting director of the National Gallery of Art, was also present.

In response to a resolution adopted at the last meeting, a report on
the future of the National Gallery of Art was presented by the execu-
tive committee.

The available sites for a National Gallery of Art and the announced
plans of Andrew W. Mellon were discussed.

The death of Joseph H. Gest, chairman of the Commission, on June
26, 1935, was announced, and resolutions, submitted by Dr. Abbot,
were adopted.

The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: Charles
L. Borie, Jr., chairman; Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., vice chairman;
and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, secretary; as well as the members of the
executive committee: Charles Moore, Herbert Adams, and George B.
McClellan. Charles L. Borie, Jr., as chairman of the Commission,
and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, as secretary of the Commission, are ex
officio members.

The Commission recommended to the Board of Regents the re-
election for the succeeding term of 4 years of the following mem-
bers: James E. Fraser, Frank J. Mather, Jr., and Edmund C. Tarbell.

Messrs. Borie, Keppel, and Young were appointed to suggest the
names of three persons from which the Commission should select one
for recommendation to the Board of Regents to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Joseph Gest.

The Commission viewed certain works of art offered to the Gal-
lery within the year, and selected the following:

THE NATIONAL GALLERY REFERENCE LIBRARY

The library has been increased materially by numerous gifts and
purchases. Miss Helen G. Rankin was temporarily employed as
librarian.

SPECIAL DETAILS

The Acting Director was detailed from November 13 to 18, 1935,
to attend the opening of the Cecilia Beaux exhibition at the gallery
of the Society of Arts and Letters, New York City, and to study the
art collections and methods of exhibiting in various art institutions,
including the Morgan Library, the Museum of Modern Art, the
Roerich Museum, the Museum of the City of New York, the Brook-
lyn Museum of Arts and Sciences, and the Metropolitan Museum of
Art; and in Philadelphia, at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
Arts, the exhibit of contemporary American miniatures and water
colors,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ol

A second detail from February 6 to 9, 1936, was granted to visit
the new Art Museum at Richmond, Va., as well as the Art Academy
and the Valentine’s Museum, but the real occasion of this trip was
to study the 300 or more American miniatures assembled in the Gibbes
Memorial Art Gallery at Charleston, S. C. This is one of a series
of exhibitions of Early American miniatures which this gallery has
brought together in the last few years. These exhibitions have been
the means of discovering the names of artists not known before as
well as much new information about others.

Curator for expert opinion as to provenance, age, meaning, or other
significance. Written or oral reports on these objects were made
to the institutions or private owners who asked for this service. Six
hundred and seventy-three objects, 225 photographs of objects, and

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1936, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress of February 2, 1935. The act
referred to contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the Amer-
ean Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation of
archeologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, includ-

ing necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and illustra-
tions, the purchase of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses, $58,730.00.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

At the beginning of the fiscal year M. W. Stirling, Chief of the
Bureau, was in southern Florida for the purpose of locating arche-
ological sites which it was anticipated would be excavated later in
the year with relief labor. Mr. Stirling returned to Washington
the latter part of July. In December two Works Progress Admin-
istration archeological projects having been approved on request of
the Florida State Archaeological Survey in cooperation with the
Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Stirling again went to Florida in order
to consult with Works Progress Administration officials and super-
vise the establishing of the projects in Hillsborough and Dade Coun-
ties. He returned to Washington December 22. During the visit
of a Blackfeet Indian delegation to Washington in the month of
March 1936 opportunity was taken to make further checks and modi-
fications on the sign language material of the late Gen. Hugh L.
Scott.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, devoted the greater part of his
time during the first half of the fiscal year to the arrangement of the
Timucua linguistic material under stems. Further material was
added to his large paper on the Indians of the Southeast. On De-
cember 26, 1935, Dr. Swanton was appointed by the President a mem-
ber of a commission of seven “to study and report to the next session
of Congress its recommendations for a suitable celebration of the
four-hundredth anniversary of the expedition of Hernando de Soto.”

36
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY By

A later act of Congress extends the time within which the report may
be made to January 2, 1939. Since this appointment was made, the
activities of the Commission have absorbed a great deal of his time,
involving as they do the promotion of research in foreign deposi-
tories of manuscripts, particularly those of Spain, the translation of
Spanish works, and especially a study and determination, as far as
that is possible, of the route taken by the great explorer and his suc-
cessor, Moscoso, through territories now covered by 10 States of the
Union. This involves the use of library materials and direct study in
the field. At the request of the other members of the Commission,
Dr. Swanton acted in the capacity of temporary chairman in arrang-
ing the first meeting, March 5 to 7, in the Smithsonian Building. At
this meeting Dr. Swanton accepted the permanent chairmanship of
the Commission, with the understanding, however, that he was to
serve only until the factual report is made. A second meeting was
held at Tampa, Fla., on May 4 to 6. After this was over, he accom-
panied Col. J. R. Fordyce, vice-chairman of the Commission, in an
investigation of parts of the route of De Soto between Florida and
Mississippi, and May 30 to June 18 he made a second expedition to
examine that section between South Carolina and the Mississippi
River.

During the year an interesting and ethnologically important letter
bearing on the Indians of Florida was brought to Dr. Swanton’s
attention by Dr. Lucy L. Wenhold, of Salem College, Winston-Salem,
N.C. A negative photostat of this document is also in the possession
of the Florida State Historical Society, which has kindly loaned the
use of it in making a positive copy, and this is being prepared for
publication in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections with anno-
tations by Dr. Swanton and Dr. Wenhold.

On July 3, 1935, Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, started on an
expedition to the region of James and Hudson Bays, made possible by
a subvention from the American Council of Learned Societies. The
object was to make a linguistic map of this area. He spent some
weeks at Moose Factory, about 10 days at the Great Whale River, a
little over 2 weeks at Fort George, and a day at Rupert’s House, and
returned to Washington September 20. Besides getting data from
the Indians and Eskimos of these places, he was able to get in contact
with one Indian from the East Main River, one Cree from Wenusk,
on the west side of Hudson Bay, one Cree from the Albany River,
who had also been at Attawapiskat, and one Ojibwa from the Albany
River. Data from some of the more remote localities were obtained
by indirect means. His observations indicate that the folklore and
mythology of these northern tribes are far closer to those of the
Central Algonquian tribes than is usually thought.
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

On June 5, under a new grant from the American Council of
Learned Societies, Dr. Michelson left Washington to renew his studies
among the Indians and Eskimos of the James and Hudson Bays
region.

The entire fiscal year was spent by Dr. John P. Harrington, eth-
nologist, in study of the Mission Indians of California, compiling
complete notes for the forthcoming edition of the Boscana manu-
script of 1882, which tells in 15 chapters of the life and religion of
these Indians. This important manuscript of the early Franciscan
Father Boscana, a missionary born in Catalonia, Spain, and stationed
for years among the Mission Indians, was recently discovered by
Dr. Harrington and a literal English translation of it without notes
has already been published.

As a byproduct of the preparation of these notes an interesting
account of the ethnology of the Mission Indians has been assembled,
covering their mode of life, dress, food, sociology, religion, language,
and knowledge of nature. The presence of Mission Indians in
Washington has constantly enhanced and perfected this work
throughout the fiscal year.

At the beginning of the year Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, Jr., archeologist,
was engaged in excavations at the Lindenmeier site north of Fort
Collins, Colo. This work was continued until September 10. The
Lindenmeier site is the location where the first series of stone imple-
ments definitely attributable to the Folsom complex, the oldest estab-
lished horizon in the archeology of North America, was found in
the autumn of 1934. The investigations of the 1935 season were a
continuation of those begun the preceding fall and consisted of in-
tensive excavation of certain portions of the site. The digging
brought forth additional information which makes possible the draw-
ing of more detailed conclusions on the material culture of Folsom
man.

When the summer’s project was brought to a close Dr. Roberts
went to Globe, Ariz., at the request of the authorities at Gila Pueblo,
for the purpose of conferring with members of the staff on the
finds which they had made at Snaketown, a Hohokam site, near
Phoenix. He also studied the collections in the Gila Pueblo Museum
and visited the Snaketown site and Casa Grande. The latter was
the scene of considerable activity on the part of Cosmos Mindeleff
and Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, members of the staff of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, 40 and more years ago. Dr. Roberts returned
to Washington October 1.

In January he took part, by special invitation, in a symposium on
Karly Man in America which was held at the annual meeting of the
Society of American Naturalists at St. Louis. He also prepared a
manuscript detailing the work done during the summer. This report,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

Additional Information on the Folsom Complex: Report on the Sec-
ond Season’s Investigations at the Lindenmeier Site in Northern
Colorado, was issued on June 30 as Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections, vol. 95, no. 10.

Dr. Roberts left Washington June 1 for Anderson, Iowa, to inspect
a site where Folsom points and other material had been found. This
proved to be a highly interesting place, as it marks the easternmost
locality that the true or High Plains form of the Folsom point has
been noted. While in Iowa he saw and studied numerous collections
of specimens and found evidence of the Folsom complex at. a number
of sites. From Iowa he proceeded to Colorado, where he resumed
excavations at the Lindenmeier site. By the end of the year, June 30,
several trenches had been run through portions of the site and an area
20 by 30 feet had been completely cleared. of the several feet of accu-
mulated earth which had covered it. This area consisted of an old
occupation level upon which the traces of Folsom man and his activ-
ities were numerous.

From July 1935 to January 1936 Dr. W. D. Strong, anthropologist,
served as consultant in anthropology to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
In addition to office work in relation to numerous acculturation studies
being made on various Indian reservations of the United States, Dr.
Strong made two field trips to various reservations and administrative
centers in New Mexico and Arizona in August and December, respec-
tively. In November a trip of several weeks was made to the Chip-
pewa reservations in Minnesota to advise on problems of tribal reor-
ganization. On January 5, 1936, Dr. Strong left Washington for
Honduras as leader of a joint archeological expedition from the
Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, and the
Peabody Museum, Harvard University. He was assisted in the field
by Alfred Kidder, II, and Drexel A. Paul, Jr., from the Peabody
Museum. Establishing its base at Progreso, in the Ulua Valley, the
expedition made stratigraphic excavations at several sites on the Ulua
River. In March and April Dr. Strong, with Mr. Paul, conducted
excavations around the north end of Lake Yojoa, while Mr. Kidder
worked on the Comayagua River. In May and June the entire expe-
dition worked sites on the Chemelicon River, including the site of
Naco, first visited by Cortez and the early Spanish Conquistadores.

On the Ulua River excellent stratigraphic series were secured of
the prehistoric polychrome pottery horizons. At Playa de los Muer-
tos, on the Ulua, these horizons, corresponding roughly to the close of
the Maya Old Empire, were found to overlay a much earlier living
level marked by monochrome, polished, and incised pottery.

The work of the expedition approached conclusion in June, and on
June 30 preparations for departure began. Throughout its entire
work the expedition received cordial cooperation and assistance from
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

the government of the Republic of Honduras. It was also materially
aided by the United Fruit Company, from whose employees it received
unlimited hospitality. Without these much appreciated sources of
cooperation its scientific results would have been much curtailed.

Dr. Julian H. Steward was appointed as associate anthropologist
in the Bureau, effective October 21, 1935. During September 1935,
prior to reporting to Washington, Dr. Steward traveled to Pendleton,
Oreg., for the purpose of making a selection of 200 negatives of ethno-
logical subjects taken by the late Maj. Lee Morehouse. These were
purchased by the Bureau from Mrs. L. L. Cornelison, his daughter.
From November 16 to December 10, 1935, Dr. Steward was engaged in
conducting a W. P. A. archeological project in the vicinity of Miami,
Fla. During this time he supervised the excavation of the large
mound at Miami Beach and began work on a smaller mound several
miles northwest of the city of Miami. Because of Dr. Strong’s de-
parture for Honduras, when Dr. Steward returned to Washington he
was delegated to continue the cooperative work between the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and the Bureau of American Ethnology previously
conducted by Dr. Strong. In connection with these duties Dr.
Steward made an extended trip from March 7 to April 15, 1936, in
the interest of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. On June 19 he left
Washington for the purpose of continuing his field work among the
Shoshoni, Bannock, and Gosiute Indians of Utah, Nevada, and Idaho.
During the winter and spring Dr. Steward prepared for publication a
series of trait lists collected from the Shoshoni Indians of Nevada
during the summer of 1935. From other material collected at the
same time he completed two articles entitled “Shoshoni Polyandry”
and “Panatubiji, a Biography of an Owens Valley Paiute.” In addi-
tion, Dr. Steward completed for publication in the Smithsonian
Annual Report an article entitled “Indian Petroglyphs of the United
States.”

J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, completed a detailed study of the ap-
proximate position and territorial habitat of the northern Iroquoian
tribes and of the contiguous Algonquian peoples as they were at the
time these groups were first visited by the early explorers. Mr.
Hewitt also made a historical study for the purpose of showing the
marked influence of the principles and aims of the League of the Five
Iroquois Tribes as founded by Deganawida in the early sixteenth
century on those of the Constitution of the United States.

Mr. Hewitt had previously recorded from the late Chief J. A.
Gibson two Onondaga versions of what is fundamentally a single
ritual, namely, the Requickening Address. He made a new transla-
tion of these, having first. revised both texts so that there should be
no material differences in the meaning of the two. He also made a
careful revision of the Onondaga texts and laws relating to the posi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 41

tion and powers and limitations of the Federal Chieftains, and also
those governing the Chief Warriors.

He also added to the Bureau’s collection of ritual wampum strings
by completing two new sets of strings made from loose beads on
patterns taken from originals in the Museum of the American Indian,
Heye Foundation, and a set which was owned by the late Chief David
Skye, of the Canadian Six Nations.

During the year Mr. Hewitt continued to represent the Bureau of
American Ethnology on the Advisory Committee on Geographic
Names, Department of the Interior.

On June 21, 1936, Mr. Hewitt left Washington on field duty, visit-
ing the Tuscarora Reservation near Lewiston, N. Y., and then the
Grand River Grant to the Six Nations in Ontario. On the latter
reservation he obtained a short Delaware vocabulary and a fine Mo-
hawk text embodying the so-called Handsome Lake Religion, the
preparation of which was about completed by the end of the fiscal
year.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

Miss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, in continuation of her study of Indian music, submitted
a manuscript entitled “Dance Songs of the Seminole Indians”, with
phonograph records and transcriptions of 25 songs. These songs
were recorded in February 1932 at Brighton, Fla., by Billie Stewart,
one of the best singers in the Cow Creek group of the tribe. Five
songs connected with the tribal ball game were presented, together
with songs of the alligator, steal-partner, switch-grass, and buffalo
dances. The songs of the ball game were sung to bring success and
were accompanied by beating on a water-drum hung by a strap from
the player’s shoulder. A coconut-shell rattle accompanied the dances.
All the songs of each series were recorded. This afforded an oppor-
tunity to note the maintaining of a fundamental pitch throughout
the series, with a pleasing variation of rhythm in the several melodies.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

The editing of the publications of the Bureau was continued
through the year by Stanley Searles, editor. In addition to the cur-
rent work of the office the comprehensive manuscript index of Bulle-
tins 1-100 has been corrected. All entries have been verified.

An index of Schoolcraft’s “Indian Tribes”, in six volumes, is near-
ing completion. More than 30,000 entries have been made and are
now being alphabetized.
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

Bulletin 112, “An Introduction to Pawnee Archeology”, by Waido
Rudolph Wedel, and Bulletin 113, “The Troyville Mounds, Catahoula
Parish, Louisiana”, by Winslow M. Walker, were issued.

Work has been done on other manuscripts in the custody of the

editor.
Publications distributed totaled 9,337.

LIBRARY

Miss Ella Leary continued in charge as librarian until February

There are also about 20,000 pamphlets and more than 3,000 volumes
of unbound periodicals and society transactions.

It is planned to reclassify the library according to the Library of
Congress scheme of classification, and copies of the scheme in the
Bureau’s field have been furnished by the Library of Congress. All
new material is being put in the new classification, and it is hoped
that a real start on older material can be made during the coming
year. A shelf list has been begun and will be continued along with
the reclassification.

A depository set of Library of Congress catalog cards is being
established.

A beginning has been made on refiling the catalog and the task will
be completed within the next few months.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1936:

Congress appropriated for that year $44,262, which is an increase
of $3,084 over the amount granted for the Service during 1935. The
repayments from departmental and other establishments amounted
to $3,563.30, making the total resources available for the exchanges
during the year $47,825.30.

The total number of packages handled during 1936 was 596,951, a
decrease of 57,180. The weight was 618,789 pounds, an increase of
58,408 pounds.

The material sent and received through the International Exchange
Service is placed under three classes—parliamentary documents, de-
partmental documents, and scientific and literary publications. The
following table gives the number and weight of packages containing
the publications coming under those headings.

During the year 2,475 boxes were shipped abroad, an increase of 288
over the preceding 12 months. Of these boxes, 529 were for the for-
eign depositories of full sets of United States governmental docu-
ments and the remainder (1,946) were for distribution to miscel-
laneous establishments and individuals.

As has been referred to in previous reports, in addition to the
packages forwarded in boxes for distribution by foreign exchange
bureaus, many are mailed directly to their destinations—some because

44
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 45

it is more economical to send by mail than by freight; some, like the
daily issue of the Congressional Record, because treaty stipulations
provide that they shall be so forwarded; and some for the reason
that they are for places remote from existing exchange agencies,
The total number of packages transmitted by mail during the year
was 70,899, an increase of 12,026 over last year.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of full sets of governmental publications forwarded
abroad is 61 and of partial sets 50, making a total of 111 sets. The
depository of the partial set sent to Bengal has been changed from
the Department of Education to the Bengal Legislative Council
Department, Calcutta. A complete list of the depositories is given

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1936:

The regular appropriation made by Congress for the maintenance
of the Park was $215,000. The total expenditures for the year from
this appropriation were about $214,200.

IMPROVEMENTS

The fiscal year 1936 marked the beginning of more substantial im-
provements than had ever before been made in any one year or a
considerable period of years in the Zoo. Under a grant from the
Public Works Administration of $680,000, supplemented later by
$191,575, contracts were let and work begun on five projects. These
include machine and carpenter shops and a garage; the installation
of three 250-horsepower down draft boilers, which will serve to heat
all of the exhibition buildings with the exception of the bird house,
which was considered as being too remote from the others to warrant
a conduit being built to it; a brick exhibition building approximately
185 by 115 feet for small mammals and great apes; a stone exhibition
building 227 by 90 feet to house large animals, such as elephant,
rhinoceros, and hippopotamus; and a new wing to the bird house.

The machine shop and central heating plant will be completed in
time to supply heat to the buildings in the fall. The other buildings
should be finished by January 1, 1937.

The completion of these projects will give the Zoo four large,
modern buildings containing numbers of new features for the ex-
hibition of animals and is the greatest improvement in the history
of the Zoo.

With the use of labor assigned to us through the District Works
Progress Administration and some material from the same source,
together with materials purchased from our regular appropriation,
5,083 linear feet of concrete road and walk curbing were constructed
and 4,112 square yards of roads and walks were given bitulithic sur-
facings. Also 14,038 square yards of road were tarred, graveled, and
rolled. The worst of the holes in the road between the mechanical
sheps and the crossroads at the Harvard Street entrance were re-
paired preparatory to a tar-gravel treatment when the construction

53
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

work at the shops is finished. Terra cotta sewer, 1,700 linear feet of
12-inch diameter, was laid from the District sewer along the creek to
the vicinity of the great flight cage in the ravine. This was a step
in the line of diverting all sanitary sewerage from the creek into the
District’s sanitary sewers. Repairs were also made to the storm
water sewers in the same ravine, and 2,000 feet of various sized water
lines were laid.

The improvement of the grounds by planting grass, shrubs, and
trees, removal of objectionable or surplus vegetation, grading, and
related grounds work has been carried on with very satisfactory re-
sults. Material progress has been made in the removal of poison ivy.

A small amount of miscellaneous repairs to buildings and fences
has been carried out with funds from our regular appropriation
and unskilled labor assigned to us under W. P. A. When certain
W. P. A. clerical employees assigned to the Zoo were not urgently
needed on routine work directly connected with the W. P. A., they
rendered substantial assistance in repairing a considerable number
of valuable pamphlets relating to zoology and in arranging them in
the Zoo library. Just at the close of the year a bookbinder assigned
to the Institution by the W. P. A. was detailed to this branch of
the Smithsonian library. This arrangement is most promising for
the binding and repairing of many valuable publications in our
excellent vertebrate zoology brary which otherwise would rapidly
deteriorate.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 55

About 3 o’clock every afternoon, except Sunday, a census is made
of the cars parked on the Zoo grounds. During the year 22,997 were
so listed, representing every State in the Union, Hawaii, Canada,
Canal Zone, Alaska, and Cuba. Since the total number is merely a
record of those actually parked at one time, it is not of value as
indicating a total attendance but is of importance as showing the
percentage attendance by States, Territories, and countries. The
District of Columbia comprised slightly over 52 percent; Maryland,
19 percent; Virginia, 11 percent; and the remaining cars were from
other States, Territories, and countries. During years in which
counts have been made on Sunday as well as during the week it has
been found that the percentage of cars from the District of Columbia,
Maryland, and Virginia is less, and the percentage of the more
distant States is correspondingly increased. This is brought about
by tourists coming to the Zoo on Sundays when other points of
interest are closed to them.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts—The collection was enriched by a number of important
gifts. A Hood Island tortoise was received from Rear Admiral C, S.
Freeman, United States Navy. From Mrs. A. N. Pack, Espanola,
N. Mex., a splendid pair of pumas were received. Elisha Hansen,
Washington, D. C., presented a black-striped wallaby. A number
of rare frogs of the genera Dendrobates and Atelopus were received
from Dr. E. R. Dunn, Haverford, Pa. Miss Gloria Hollister, of
the New York Zoological Society, presented three Trinidad vampire
bats. R. E. Stadelmann, traveling in Central and South America,
continued his generosity and interest in the Park with several ship-
ments of reptiles.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the ac-
tivities of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1936:

As heretofore, our principal work has been the determination of
the variability of the intensity of the sun’s radiation as it would be
found outside of our atmosphere; 1. e., changes in the so-called solar
constant of radiation. Measurements of the solar constant of radia-
tion have been continued daily when possible at three stations:
Table Mountain, Calif., Montezuma, Chile, and Mount St. Katherine,
Egypt. Although to the eye the sky at Table Mountain seems
equally as favorable to the work as that at the two foreign stations,
the measurements at Table Mountain show much greater irregularity.
Days that appear excellent there sometimes yield solar-constant
values which are quite impossible. We suppose this is caused by
invisible clouds of water vapor sweeping over the station through
the canyons of the Sierra Madre Mountains.

We have attempted in the past year to develop a criterion based
on the measurements which should inform us, before reducing an
observation, whether it is affected by this invisible prejudicial sky
condition, and in this search we have measurably succeeded. Find-
ing it so useful for Table Mountain work, we have applied it also to
the work of Montezuma and Mount St. Katherine, where much less
frequently than at Table Mountain the results are similarly inex-
plicably bad. These investigations have occupied Mr. Aldrich and
several computers at Washington for most of the year, but are now
completed. They lead to a recomputation of all solar-constant
measurements of recent years at all stations—a heavy task now
under way.

Of the criterion itself, its technical character forbids a full descrip-
tion here. In brief, it comprises constructing families of standard
curves representing average relationships of pyrheliometry to pyra-
nometry at different air masses and different values of precipitable
water. When the observations on any occasion depart from these
standard curves beyond a certain tolerance, such observations are to
be viewed with suspicion. In this way single observations of a given
day may be rejected from the mean of the day. Also, suspicious days

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY at

at one station may be justifiably rejected, because of this sort of inter-
nal evidence, when they differ widely from reasonable results of other
stations. The application of these criteria at the three stations will
lead to a new increase in the accuracy with which we may measure
the solar variability, and to a much closer agreement between the
results of the three stations.

This long-desired improvement in accuracy is now shown to be
indispensable to a proposed application of studies of solar variability
to weather forecasting.

Dr. Abbot published in May and August of 1936 two papers en-
titled, respectively, “The Dependence of Terrestrial Temperatures
on the Variations of the Sun’s Radiation” and “Further Evidence on
the Dependence of Terrestrial Temperatures on the Variations of
Solar Radiation.” These papers appear to prove that the short-
interval changes of solar radiation, such as run their courses in a few
days, are of major influence on the weather for the ensuing 2 weeks or
more. Figure 2 of the first-mentioned paper shows such effects for
the temperature of Washington. The curves shown each represent
the average results for some 10 to 20 cases occurring in each of the
months of the year of the years 1924-1935.

It is observed that opposite solar changes produce opposite tem-
perature effects; that these effects differ from month to month; that
other investigations reported in the papers cited show that they also
differ from locality to locality; that the effects are of large magnitude,
sometimes reaching 15° F., sufficient indeed to account for most varia-
tions from the normal temperature; that these effects follow solar
changes seldom as great as 1.5 percent and averaging only about 0.7
percent.

After discussion of these results with the Chief of the United States
Weather Bureau and with several gentlemen of the Weather Bureau
Advisory Committee, these gentlemen all agreed that the investiga-
tions offered reasonable promise of a method of forecasting some
features of the weather for at least 2 weeks in advance. They
unitedly signed a memorandum recommending increased support to
the Astrophysical Observatory to enable it to set up seven additional
solar stations in the best localities of the world, and also to investi-
gate the possibility of automatic determinations of solar variability
from sounding balloons. This measure was approved by the Presi-
dent and the Bureau of the Budget, passed the Senate as an amend-
ment to the Urgent Deficiency Act, but was rejected in conference
with the House.

The Institution has since made a small grant from private funds
to promote preliminary studies for the balloon investigation referred
to, but the application of solar variation observations to weather fore-
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

casting must await Government support. The necessary expense will
approximate $200,000 a year. It is necessary to observe the complete
solar radiation of all wave lengths nearly every single day to an
accuracy of 4 of a percent at mountain solar-constant stations, or else
to observe daily the intensity of a certain band of ultraviolet solar
rays from sounding balloons at an altitude of 100,000 feet or more,
with an accuracy of 2 percent or better. Either plan involves diffi-
culty and expense, but the probable advance in weather forecasting
seems to justify it.

In August 1935 Dr. Abbot published a study of the variation found
in the monthly mean values of the solar constant of radiation since the
year 1920. This was entitled “Solar Radiation and Weather Studies.”
The following conclusions are quoted from the summary:

1. The output of radiation of the sun varies, as proved by simultaneous
observations at three stations remote from each other.

2. The solar variation, seemingly irregular, really comprises 12 or more regu-
lar periodicities, which support successful predictions of solar changes for years
in advance.

11. Forecasts based on these relations having been made to cover the years
1934, 1985, and 19386 for more than 380 stations in the United States, these fore-
casts are fairly well verified both as to temperature and precipitation in 1934.

Although, as stated in conclusion 11, fair success was achieved in
the predictions for the year 1934, the success was less complete in 1935
and 1936. Weather details, though present, were found to be displaced
in time so much as to invalidate the method for detailed predictions
more than a year in advance. This partial failure is believed to be
caused by the changes of phase of the subordinate periodicities which
make up the 23-year cycle. It is hoped that further study may give
means of predicting these changes of phase, and so of perfecting the
method.

But while the prediction of details is thus unsatisfactory, certain
large and prolonged features, like the great drought in the Northwest,
seem to be very clearly previsioned by the cycle. This appears plainly
in the accompanying figure 1, a reproduction of figure 26B of the
article. It is very plain that the first decades of each of the five 23-year
cycles shown there were marked by the fall of the level of Lake Huron,
but that this depression in the first, third, and fifth cycles is outstand-
ing. Thus there seems to be a 46-year cycle of great droughts, and
while moderate drought conditions may be expected in the decade
1950-1960, a severe drought is probable in the decade 1975 to 1985.

The present drought seems comparable to those of the decades fol-
lowing 1840 and 1890, and may therefore be expected to last for a year,
or possibly 2 years more before the initiation of recovery. But it
would be rash to make a more definite prediction.

PERSONNEL

No changes of personnel have occurred other than the shifting of
observers from one field station to another, except that on April 16,
1936, Alfred G. Froiland reported as bolometric assistant to take
station at Mount St. Katherine.

SUMMARY

The year has been distinguished for the introduction of a new
criterion for distinguishing unsatisfactory sky conditions at the
solar-constant stations. This will add decidedly to the accuracy and
harmony of the results. Studies of the variability of the sun over an
interval of 15 years have disclosed many periodicities, all aliquot
parts of 23 years, which altogether make up the apparently irregular
solar variation of long term. The cycle of 23 years is abundantly
evidenced in weather and things dependent thereon. Besides this it
is shown that the weather is to a great extent governed for at least
2 weeks afterward by the initiation of incidental rising or falling
solar radiation, usually of only a few days’ duration. Expert opinion
concurs that this affords a promising method of forecasting certain
weather features for at least 2 weeks in advance. Unfortunately, it
requires expansions of our solar-observation program, which thus
far there are no funds to finance. Papers detailing these investi-
gations were published by the Director in the Smithsonian Miscel-
laneous Collections under the following titles: “The Dependence of
Terrestrial Temperatures on the Variations of the Sun’s Radiation”,
“Further Evidence on the Dependence of Terrestrial Temperatures
on the Variations of Solar Radiation”, and “Solar Radiation and
Weather Studies.”

APPENDIX 8

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION
AND ORGANISMS

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Division of Radiation and Organisms during the year
ended June 30, 1936:

This has been a year of large accomplishment in several fields. Mr.
Hoover’s work on the dependence of carbon dioxide assimilation in
wheat on wave length of radiation has been amplified and rounded
out for publication. This pioneering research has produced and
checked a curve which gives the efficiency of the different-colored
rays to promote photosynthesis. The curve starts at zero in the
violet, runs to a maximum in the blue at about 4,400 A, continues of
moderate intensity in the green and yellow, rises to its highest maxi-
mum in the red at 6,500 A, and then falls to zero.

Dr. Meier has continued her experiments on the effects of ultra-
violet rays on algae. Besides checking former work and publishing
on lethal effects, she has shown that ultraviolet rays of maximum
lethal influence when applied in minute doses are stimulating. This
behavior reminds us of the effects of certain poisonous drugs which
in minute doses are stimulants.

Dr. Johnston has continued experiments on the effects of light of
different wave lengths to promote growth effects of various kinds in
tomatoes. His work has yielded much advance in the technique of
these investigations. Among other results which stand out clearly,
he finds that rest periods not only from radiation but of diminished
temperature are necessary to these plants.

He gave the annual Arthur Lecture on the subject of the influences
of the sun on plant growth.

Dr. McAlister has developed an extremely sensitive and quick-act-
ing spectroscopic method for measuring carbon dioxide concentration.
A concentration of 1/10,000 of 1 percent carbon dioxide in air is
readily measured. The respiration and carbon dioxide assimilation
of a single grain of wheat in its germination is readily observed.
Studies of the dependence of photosynthesis in wheat on time factors
are in progress and are yielding beautiful and remarkable results.
Dr. McAlister also did interesting cooperative work with the Depart-
ment of Agriculture on the germination of seeds.

81
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

Mr. Clark has made valuable developments in the technique of
special lights useful for studies of plant growth. He has also made
important improvements in thermoelectric junction material, having
developed a couple of high sensitiveness and at the same time as
rugged as ordinary wires of common metals of equal size. With
Mr. Fillmen he has constructed much new apparatus for the uses of
the Division.

The work finished or in hand will shortly afford publications of
great interest to plant physiologists and others. Individuals of the
Division have been of utmost value to the Astrophysical Observatory
and other branches of the Institution, assisting in special problems.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 9
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the ac-
tivities of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1936:

THE LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library, or library system, comprises 10 major
and 35 minor units, each an important instrument in the work of
the Institution or of one of its affiliated bureaus. They are as fol-
lows: The main library, or the Smithsonian deposit in the Library
of Congress—a collection which, while somewhat general in char-
acter, is chiefly scientific and technical and contains extensive files
of monographs and serials, American and foreign, including the
reports, proceedings, and transactions of many learned societies and
institutions; the library of the United States National Museum,
which also concerns itself largely with natural history and tech-
nology, and has more or less closely connected with it the 35 sectional
libraries of administration, administrative assistant’s office, agricul-
tural history, anthropology, archeology, biology, birds, botany,
echinoderms, editor’s office, engineering, ethnology, fishes, foods,
geology, graphic arts, history, insects, invertebrate paleontology,
mammals, marine invertebrates, medicine, minerals, mollusks, organic
chemistry, paleobotany, photography, physical anthropology, prop-
erty clerk’s office, reptiles and batrachians, superintendent’s office,
taxidermy, textiles, vertebrate paleontology, and wood technology;
the library of the Bureau of American Ethnology, concerned with
the history, life, and culture of the early peoples of the Americas,
notably the North American Indians; the library of the Astrophysi-
cal Observatory, on astrophysics and meteorology; the library of the
Freer Gallery of Art, related to the special interests of the Freer
Gallery, namely, the art and culture of the Far East, India, Persia,
and the nearer East, and the art of James McNeill Whistler and
other American painters, and containing the celebrated Biblical
manuscripts of the fourth and fifth centuries, known as the Wash-
ington Manuscripts; the library of the National Gallery of Art, on
the fine arts of Europe and America; the Langley aeronautical
library—the famous collection of aeronautical publications, many of
them very rare, that once belonged to Samuel Pierpont Langley,

112059—37——7 83
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

Alexander Graham Bell, Octave Chanute, and James Means, and
that since 1930, under its own name and book plate, has supplemented
the Government collection on aeronautics in the Library of Con-
gress; the Smithsonian office library, made up of general reference
works, publications of the Institution and its branches as well as of
various foreign learned societies and institutions, and a large num-
ber of popular books and magazines; the radiation and organisms
library, pertaining to the studies the Institution is making of the
influence of the sun on plant and animal life; and the library of the
National Zoological Park, on animals and their care. In the libraries
taken together there are about 860,000 volumes, pamphlets, and
charts. This total does not include thousands of volumes awaiting
completion, binding, and cataloging.

PERSONNEL

Four changes took place in the permanent staff during the year.

Miss Ella Leary, after a long service as librarian of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, retired, and Miss Miriam B. Ketchum was
transferred to the vacancy from the library of the Weather Bureau.
Miss Ketchum received the B. A. and M. A. degrees from George
Washington University, where two of her special interests were li-
brary science and anthropology. Before her appointment to the
Weather Bureau in 1934 she served for some years on the library staff
of the Naval Observatory.

Mrs. Grace A. Parler, who since 1980 had been in immediate charge
of the library of the Freer Gallery of Art, resigned. She was suc-
ceeded by Miss Alice Elizabeth Hill, who had taken the B. A. degree
at American University, studied library science in George Washing-
ton University, and obtained considerable experience at various times
as a temporary employee of the Smithsonian library.

Miss Ruth E. Blanchard, a graduate in library science of the Uni-
versity of Oklahoma and for several years a member of the library
staff of the university, was appointed to the position of minor library
assistant in the Astrophysical Observatory, under an arrangement,
however, by which part of her salary is paid by the National Zoologi-
cal Park and part of her time given to its hbrary.

Stephen Stuntz, who for 6 years had been assistant messenger, was
promoted to a post elsewhere in the Institution, and the vacancy was
filled by the selection of Carroll McKinley Martin.

The temporary assistants were Miss Margaret Link, Miss Helen
Rankin, Miss Wilda Suter, and Mrs. Emma B. Thomsen. A number
of workers under the F. EK. R. A. were also assigned to the library for
a time early in the year and toward its close several under the

W2oPs.A.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85
EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

As usual, although some of the accessions for the year were pre-
sented by friends of the Smithsonian or were purchased, most of them
came in exchange for the publications of the Institution and its
branches. The packages received by mail numbered 21,808 and
through the International Exchange Service 2,868—an increase of
1,920 over the previous year. Especially noteworthy were the send-
ings from the R. Deputazione di Storia Patria per le Provincie di
Romagna, Bologna; the Academia Romana, Bucharest; the Carlisle
Natural History Society, Carlisle; the Erdélyi Mtizeum, Cluj; the
Instituto Nazionale di Ottica, Firenze; the Naturforschende Gesell-
schaft zu Leipzig, Leipzig; the Société Géologique de Belgique,
Liége; the Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society,
Newport; the Nigerian Field Society, Ondo; the R. Laboratorio
Centrale di Idrobiologia, Rome; the Fauna och Flora, Stockholm;
the Botanisches Institut, Franz-Josefs Universitit, Szeged; the Knox
Academy of Arts and Sciences, Thomaston; the Japanese Patho-
logical Society, Tokyo; and the Instytut Popierania Nauki, Warsaw.
More detailed mention should be made of two sendings—one that of
41 monographs and bulletins, from the Oriental Institute, Chicago;
the other of 156 publications—some long since out of print—from the
Museum of Comparative Zoédlogy, Cambridge. ‘The last two send-
ings were obtained by the library under a special exchange arrange-
ment, the latter by returning to Harvard some of the university’s
publications that had found their way into the Smithsonian dupli-
cate collection. These many unusual sendings added materially to
the resources of the Smithsonian deposit and the library of the
National Museum.

Among the publications received were 7,021 dissertations from the
Academy of Freiberg, the Agricultural School of Bonn-Poppelsdorf,
the universities of Basel, Berlin, Bern, Bonn, Breslau, Budapest,
Erlangen, Freiburg, Giessen, Greifswald, Halle, Heidelberg, Jena,
Johns Hopkins, Kiel, Koln, Leipzig, Lund, Marburg, Neuchatel,
Pennsylvania, Rostock, Tiibingen, Utrecht, Wirzburg, and Ziirich,
and the technical schools of Berlin, Braunschweig, Delft, Dresden,
Karlsruhe, and Ziirich.

In connection with the exchange and other activities of the library
the staff wrote 2,651 letters, or 516 more than the year before, arranged
for 300 new exchanges, or 36 more than in 1935, and obtained, in
response to 584 request cards, 6,422 volumes and parts needed in the
libraries of the Institution. It should be pointed out, however, that,
thanks to the recent organization of the Smithsonian duplicates, many
of these publications were found in this collection—a fact that was
particularly true of the large number sent to the Smithsonian deposit

86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

and the libraries of the Astrophysical Observatory, Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, and National Museum. Several thousand documents
of foreign governments were forwarded by the library, as usual, to
the division of documents in the Library of Congress.

GIFTS

Among the gifts of the year at least two were notable. They were
the collections—each numbering many thousands—of publications on
invertebrate paleontology and orthoptera gathered, respectively, dur-
ing a long period of service in the National Museum by Dr. E. O.
Ulrich and the late Dr, A. N. Caudell and presented, each with a
complete card index, by Dr. Ulrich and Mrs. Caudell. It is gratify-
ing to know that these unique and valuable semiprivate libraries are
not to be dispersed but are to remain permanently as instrumentalities
of research in the sections where they have grown up. A similar col-
lection—or, at least part of it—namely, that of the late Dr. Walter
Hough on anthropology, also became the property of the library
during the year. Special mention should be made, too, of the gift
of a generous number of its own publications from the Philosophical
Society of Washington, to be used by the library for exchange pur-
poses. Other large gifts were received from the Bureau of the Inter-
national Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, the Geophysical Laboratory of the
Carnegie Institution, the Anthropological Society of Washington,
and the Washington Academy of Sciences, as well as from the estate
of the late Dr. W. L. Abbott and from W. P. Hay, son of the late
Dr. O. P. Hay. One of the most welcome gifts came from the
Library of Congress. It was a complete set—the fourth presented
to the Institution—of printed cards covering the publications of the
Smithsonian and its bureaus, for filing in the sectional catalogs of
the Museum. The smaller gifts included Contribution 4 l’étude des
Pilons Océaniens, by His Excellency Governor L., J. Bouge, of Guade-
loupe, from the author; Zoologische Ergebnisse einer Reise nach
Bonaire, Curacao und Aruba im Jahre 1930, 3 volumes, from Dr.
P. W. Hummelinck; Beitrige zur Mineralogie von Japan, by T.
Wada, from T. Ito; Charles F. Dowd, by Charles N. Dowd, from
Ralph W. Lester; Japanese Works of Art, 6 volumes, selected from
the Moslé Collection, from Alexander G. Moslé; Moss Flora of North
America North of Mexico, volume II, parts 1-3, by A. J. Grout, from
the author; Back to Newton, a Challenge to Einstein’s Theory of
Relativity, by George de Bothezat, from the author; The Microscope

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

Among the special activities of the year, a few may be mentioned
as indicating further progress toward making the library system a
more complete and efficient instrument in the work of the Institu-
tion and its branches.

The slow and tedious task of sorting, arranging, and labeling the
large collection of miscellaneous material, including many thousands
of scientific and technical serials, that had accumulated for years on
the second and third floors of the west stacks of the Smithsonian
Building—an undertaking referred to in several annual reports as
receiving special attention—was at last practically finished, with the
gratifying result that, as in 1934 and 1935, hundreds of publications
were brought to light that were needed in the libraries of the Insti-
tution. It is hoped that the unchecked material on the first floor
can receive similar treatment during the coming year, in connection
particularly with the reorganization of the office library and the
rearrangement, and possible reassignment, of the Watts de Peyster
collection.

The staff sorted and arranged the 7,000 and more publications that
were recently given to the hbrary by the International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature, selecting 1,019 for the National Museum, 108 for
the Astrophysical Observatory, and 235 for the Smithsonian deposit.
Most of these found their way into the active sets; the others into the
reserve file—a collection, begun a year or two ago, of standard scien-
tific works designed to meet the future requirements of the Institution.
To this file will probably be added many of the remaining items,
especially some of the longer runs, in this noteworthy gift. It is
expected that permanent shelf room will be provided for the reserve
collection in the west end of the Smithsonian Building when disposal
is made of the duplicates now occupying this space.

The staff also continued the task of reorganizing the technological
library and several of the sectional libraries, notably that of administra-
tion, in the Arts and Industries Building; advanced the work of classi-
fying the Bell aeronautical clippings; withdrew 913 reprints and sep-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 89

arates from the natural history library and sent them to the curators
concerned; sorted according to subject the set of 27,200 printed cards
covering to date the publications of the Institution and its branches,
that was presented during the year by the Library of Congress, and
forwarded them to the el libraries for filing; picked out 603
surplus maps from the collection in the National Museum and trans-
ferred them to the Smithsonian deposit, where they would be pre-
served against possible future need; prepared 300 volumes for the
bindery, to be sent early in July as the first installment of several
thousand publications to be bound with the deficiency appropriation
made to the Smithsonian for this purpose toward the close of the
fiscal year ; checked and rearranged the reference collection in the office
library; continued to date the index of Smithsonian publications and
contributed substantially to the index of exchange relations; brought
nearly to completion the seven library sets of Smithsonian publica-
tions—a piece of work that has required years of special search for
missing items, many long since out of print; and finished cataloging
the Chinese and Japanese publications in the library of the Freer
Gallery of Art, as well as the field collection that had been returned
to the Gallery from China the year before.

They sent back to the Superintendent of Documents a large number
of Government publications that either were duplicates or were not
pertinent to the work of the Institution; turned over many thousands
of other items not in the immediate field of Smithsonian interest to
the libraries of the Army Medical Museum, Department of Agricul-
ture, Office of Education, and Geological Survey, and the Public
Library of the District of Columbia; assisted further the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in its effort, begun the
year before and shared in at that time by the library, to complete its
office set of Science by presenting to the Association 448 more numbers
of this publication; made generous sendings of duplicates, under a
special exchange arrangement, to the Musée Nationale d’Histoire
Naturelle, Paris, the John Crerar Library, Chicago, the Marine Bio-
logical Laboratory, Woods Hole, and the libraries of the following
colleges and universities: Brown, Catholic, Columbia, Hamilton, Har-
vard, Pennsylvania, Princeton, Vanderbilt, and Yale. From these
institutions, as well as from Cornell University, Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
were received many valuable publications, most of which, if it had
not been for the special exchange arrangement referred to, the brary
would have had to buy.

Finally, the staff was called on for even more reference and biblio-
graphical service than usual, not only in connection with the regular
interests of the Institution in science, technology, and art, but in
90 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

response to inquiries of a miscellaneous character from correspondents
throughout the country.
NEEDS

The needs of the library remain the same—more trained assistants,
more funds for binding and for purchasing necessary books and peri-
odicals that cannot be obtained in exchange, and more shelf room for
several of the important collections that have outgrown their
accommodations,

Respectfully submitted.

Wuu1AM L. Corsin, Librarian.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.

REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 99
FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave
to the Institution his collection of Chinese and other oriental objects
of art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by
Whistler, Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave
funds for the construction of a building to house the collection, and
finally, in his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and
securities to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endowment
fund for the operation of the gallery. From the above date to the
present time these funds have been increased by stock dividends, sav-
ings of income, etc., to a total of $4,651,867.07. In view of the impor-
tance and special nature of the gift and the requirements of the
testator in respect to it, all Freer funds are kept separate from the
other funds of the Institution, and the accounting in respect to them
is stated separately.

The invested funds of the Freer bequest are classified as follows:

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genrrat Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific
discovery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool-
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi-
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1936.

ASTRONOMY IN SHAKESPEARE’S TIME
AND IN OURS

By C. G. ABBOT
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

[With 6 plates]

About 50 years ago Dr. S. P. Langley, third secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, wrote a charming book called The New
Astronomy. He pointed out that from the earliest times almost
until his own, astronomy had been restricted to the study of the posi-
tions and motions of the heavenly bodies. Now the inquiry had be-
come more and more: What are members of the heavenly host in
chemical and physical constitution? Both branches of astronomy
have made astonishing progress since Langley wrote, as we shall
see in contrasting astronomy’s present status with that of Shakes-
peare’s time. What I wish to emphasize by referring to Langley’s
book is that nothing that depends on the use of the spectroscope or
of photography was known to the astronomers of Galileo’s and
Shakespeare’s generation. And we may well estimate that three-
fourths of our present knowledge of the subject depends on photo-
graphic and spectroscopic observations.

Astronomy is the distinguished child of that gypsylike mother,
astrology. In Babylonia, the sun, moon, and planets were gods and
goddesses. Fortunate and unfortunate public events were naturally
associated with the intervention of the gods, and hence with the
aspect of the heavenly bodies. It therefore became a priestly duty
to watch the heavens for portents. In this way astrology was born,
flourished, and gave birth to astronomy. During at least 2,000 years
there grew up a great body of knowledge of the motions of the sun,
moon, planets, and stars, but until the seventeenth century of our era
there were no telescopes or accurate clocks by which observations
exact enough to prove sound theory could be made.

The poet Shakespeare lived at the very beginning of a new astro-
nomical epoch, which we may call the first age of the telescope, last-
ing through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries.
Copernicus, indeed, had published his great work on the motions of

the heavenly bodies. Kepler and Galileo, who made such notable dis-
coveries, were Shakespeare’s contemporaries. The telescope was
invented during his lifetime, and exact mechanisms were no longer
rare. But printing was still costly, and intelligence traveled slowly.
Indeed, the work of these great astronomers just named was slow in
receiving recognition. I believe there is no evidence from Shakes-
peare’s writings that he was aware of them or of the results of their
investigations. Like practically all other outstanding men of his
time, he appears to have accepted the system of Ptolemy, wherein
the earth was regarded as the center of the universe. Though that
master introduced his numerous epicycles and equants merely as

Fieurp 2.—Diagram of the Ptolemaic system. The four substances, earth, water, air, fire,
which the ancients supposed to be world elements, are at the center. (From The Uni-
verse, from Crystal Spheres to Relativity, by Frank Allen. Harcourt, Brace & Co., New
York, 1931.)

mathematical devices, the vulgar understanding of his system con-
ceived it to imply that the moon, the sun, the planets, and the stars
were affixed to spheres of greater and greater remoteness from the
earth. These spheres, it was supposed, moved according to combina-
tions or circular guidances too complicated for description here. It
was the concert of these spheres which made heavenly harmony ac-
cording to Pythagoras. Beyond the farthest sphere, to which the
stars were fixed, lay Heaven itself, the homeland of the blest.
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

The good sense of Shakespeare rejected the extravagant claims of
astrology, the mother of astronomy. Im one of his sonnets he
remarks:

Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck ;
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality.
(From XIVth Sonnet.)

Indeed he had astronomy! From the earliest times the celestial
host has always been an inspiration to literature. The Psalmist sings:

The Heavens declare the glory of God
And the Firmament showeth his handiwork.

Again:
When I consider Thy Heavens, the work of Thy fingers
The moon and the stars which Thou has ordained

What is man that Thou art mindful of him
Or the son of man that Thou visitest him.

Yet compared to the glorious blaze of knowledge of these subjects in
which we now live, the astronomical reflections which the Psalmist
or even Shakespeare could indulge were as the faintest glimmering.
From the astonishing combination of simplicity and complexity re-
siding in the submicroscopic atomic world to the infinitely outreach-
ing boundaries of the starry universe as we now know them, there
is displayed such a wealth of marvelous adaptations as cannot fail
to inspire even the dullest person with astonishment and awe.

Consider any solid body; be it stone, wood, metal, flesh, or any
other. Imagine a single morsel of it, no larger than a mote that flies
in the sunbeam. Small as it is, it contains at least 10 million billion
molecules. Each of these molecules contains many atoms. Each
of these atoms contains several or many smaller bodies besides pro-
tons and electrons. But these multitudinous ultimate constituents
of every speck of matter le so far separated one from another that
they are relatively as remote, each to each, as the stars are in the
heavens. Solids, then, are no more to be regarded as solids, but
rather as openwork, gossamerlike constructions, wherein the spaces
are immense compared to the occupied parts. Motions of the most
beautiful configurations dance about within these systems. The elec-
tric forces which are imprisoned in these infinitesimal structures
baffle imagination to conceive of their immensity. A large book would
not suffice to tell of all the wonders that one invisible atom contains,
in a space far below the limit of vision of the most powerful
microscope.

On the other hand, consider the heavens. We live upon the earth,
8,000 miles in diameter, which revolves about the sun 93,000,000
ASTRONOMY IN SHAKESPEARE’S TIME—ABBOT 113

miles away, and more than 300,000 times as massive as the earth. Our
sun is one of the many billions of suns which we call the stars, some
of them a billion times as large as it, which throng the Milky Way.
The very nearest of them to our sun is a Centauri, a bright star of
the Southern Hemisphere. It lies so far away that light itself,
traveling 186,000 miles each second, requires 4 years to reach us.
From the remotest stars of our galaxy, light requires 100,000 years
to come, But this is by no means the limit of the universe. It may
even be limitless. At least we know that on every side of our own
starry host lie other galaxies. They are certainly millions in num-
ber. Each of them contains, like ours, a multitude of stars. These
“island universes”, as Herschel called them, lie a million light years
apart, and we recognize them still at such immense distances that
the light by which we photograph them today started toward us
200,000,000 years ago in Cambrian geologic times when our earth
was in the possession of the trilobites extinct these hundred million
years.

How keenly we must regret that the fertile mind of Shakespeare
could not draw from this abounding store of wonders material about
which to wield his magic wand of expression. In his time, atoms
were practically unthought of, and for no star, not even for our
sun, was there known the distance, motion, size, temperature, or
physical or chemical composition. The universal unity of the
building material of all nature, the vast reaches of the universe,
and the astonishing numbers and immensity of its denizens could
not possibly be imagined in their grand proportions which now we
know.

As already remarked, Shakespeare was no astrologist. In King
Lear, he puts derision of astrology into the mouth of Edmund,
as follows:

When we are sick in fortune * * * we make guilty of our disasters
the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains on necessity, fools
by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predomi-
nance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers, by enfore’d obedience of planetary
influence, and all that we are evil in, by divine thrusting on.

Of course in his fidelity to actuality Shakespeare does not hesi-
tate to put into the mouths of some of his characters exactly those
beliefs in the good and evil influences of the heavenly bodies, and
of obscure earthly things which were current among nearly all
men of his time. For instance, Horatio, moved by the appearance
of the ghost, refers as follows to the death of Caesar:

A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,

The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

He continues, after a line now lost which might have read, “The
heavens also with dread portents teemed” :

As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,

Disasters in the sun, and the moist star,

Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands

Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.

And even the like precurse of fierce events,

As harbingers preceding still the fates

And prologue to the omen coming on,

Have heaven and earth together demonstrated

Unto our climatures and countrymen.
In many other passages, Shakespeare distills the quintescence of
beauty from old astronomical beliefs which now are obsolete. None
of these references is more beautiful than those relating to Py-
thagoras’ music of the spheres. One is found in the Merchant of
Venice where Lorenzo says:

How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bankj

Here will we sit and let the sounds of music

Creep in our ears. Soft stillness and the night

Become the touches of sweet harmony.

Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven

Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.

There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st,

But in his motion like an angel sings,

Still quiring to the young-ey’d cherubins;

Such harmony is in immortal souls;

But while this muddy vesture of decay

Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

In order to appreciate more truly the status of astronomy in
Shakespeare’s time, let us take a general bird’s-eye view of the ad-
vance of that science up to the present.

The progress of astronomy suggests four epochs. In the first
epoch the observer’s eye was unaided by optical apparatus, accurate
clocks were unavailable, communication of results was slow and
costly, and records could only be multiplied by hand copying. The
human intellect, though doubtless quite as keen then as now, had but
rough and feeble observations to work upon. Hence, from the lack
of observational groundwork the theory of astronomy was encum-
bered until a few centuries ago with a maze of spheres, cycles, and
epicycles, and the pseudo-science of astrology stood on an equal or
superior plane with true astronomy in public estimation. This first
astronomical epoch began as the outgrowth of astrology in the dim
past, and only merged into the second or epoch of the telescope, during
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries of our era. Among its greatest
names stand Euclid, Archimedes, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and Regio-
montanus.
ASTRONOMY IN SHAKESPEARE’S TIME—ABBOT 115

The second epoch was ushered in by the theory of Copernicus. By
the invention of the telescope and the mechanical clock, great physical
aids became available for observation. Printing, that greatest agency
of human culture, had been invented. Mathematics, which in the
first epoch grew to comprise arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trig-
onometry, received in the second epoch not only the introduction of
logarithms but the superpowerful reinforcement of the calculus which
was invented by those great geniuses, Sir Isaac Newton and Leibnitz.
Besides these great names already mentioned, Tycho Brahe, Kepler,
Galileo, La Place, Bradley, the Herschels, and many others of nearly
equal fame immortalize this epoch. The laws of Kepler, interpreted
by Sir Isaac Newton in his theory of gravitation, were outstanding
triumphs of theory. Bradley, with his discovery of aberration of
light and his catalogs of star places, was the apostle of an accuracy
almost modern.

At the beginning of the third epoch, about 1810 to 1840, stand four
invaluable discoveries and one revolutionary observation. Photog-
raphy, the spectroscope, the wave character of light, and improved
optical glasses were the four discoveries, and the first measurement of
the immense distance of one of the nearest stars by Bessel was the
revolutionary observation. Bessel’s measurement in 1837 gave an un-
impeachable standing to the system of Copernicus. Prior to that time
everyone who accepted the view of Copernicus, that the earth re-
volves about the sun, had to accept on faith the proposition that all
the stars are so immensely distant that they are shifted only im-
perceptibly in apparent position by the displacement of the earth in
its revolution round the sun through nearly 200,000,000 miles each 6
months. Bessel measured such a shift. It corresponded to a star
distance of 60 trillion miles. How astonishing must have seemed this
tremendous extension of the universe to those to whom this immense
distance first stood undeniably revealed! The improvements in op-
tical glass led in this epoch to the construction of large achromatic
refracting telescopes of short enough focus to be manageable. The
older telescopes had required an excessive focal ratio to avoid spheri-
cal aberrations and were terribly unwieldy. ‘Thus great power was
added to eye observations. The diffraction grating for spectroscopic
work was perfected by Angstrém and Rowland. Photography, how-
ever, was delayed in coming to its own for astronomical use until near
the beginning of the fourth astronomical epoch in which we now
live. Spectrum analysis disclosed the chemistry of the sun and stars
at the middle of the nineteenth century. Here again was something
almost incredible: That we should ever know the composition of
bodies trillions of miles away!

In the present or fourth epoch of astronomical progress, extraor-
dinary aids to observation have come. These include the applica-
tion to telescopes of great engineering construction and highly accu-
rate mechanisms, fully equipped with electrical devices for their
operation. The photographic plate, the thermionic amplifier, and
the sensitive thermoelectric element have nearly displaced the eye
at the observing end of the gigantic reflecting telescopes of the pres-
ent day. Photographic records in which light builds up its story
through many hours or even many nights may now be studied at
leisure in the comfort of an office, instead of glimpsed in an instant
at the eyepiece of a telescope in frigid winter midnight. Observa-
tions with powerful spectroscopes reveal the composition, motions,
distances, and temperatures of the stars. Based on the science of
thermodynamics, twentieth-century physical knowledge and studies
of the mysteries of radium and radioactivity, of the inner construc-
tion of atoms, and of the effects of powerful excitations of atoms
by electricity or heat, have settled questions of the natures of stars
that formerly seemed insoluble. Such studies have even disclosed
stars whose material is many times as dense as gold or platinum.
And yet more paradoxical, such stars as these are nevertheless in the
gaseous state! On the other extreme are disclosed stars several
hundred million miles in diameter whose density is thousands of
times less than that of air. Sir William Herschel’s happy guess that
the nebulae are other galaxies outside our own system, or, as he
called them, “island universes”, has proved to be correct. Millions
of these remote galaxies have been disclosed, each like our own
Milky Way containing multitudes of stars, but situated so enor-
mously remotely that their light, traveling nearly 200,000 miles each
second, requires many millions of years to come from them to us.
We see them, therefore, as they were in former epochs of the earth’s
geology, when gigantic creatures now extinct abounded. What food
would this have been to an imagination like our Shakespeare’s!

Turning from these inspiring views of modern astronomical knowl-
edge, let us now explore more particularly some of the instruments,
the theories, and the observations which comprised the astronomy as
generally known in Shakespeare’s time. As we have remarked, the
unaided eye had neither telescope, photographic plate, nor sensitive
radiometer to assist 1t. The positions of the heavenly bodies could
only be observed by casting shadows or by looking through sights
analagous to those of a sporting gun. These two types of naked
visual observation are exemplified in the sundial and in the astrolabe.

Nevertheless, much information was gathered by the ancients
merely from the shadow of the sun. This knowledge reached far
beyond its well-known use in the sundial to indicate the time of day.
ASTRONOMY IN SHAKESPEARE’S TIME—ABBOT 117

For instance, by observing the length of the shadow of a vertical rod
on a horizontal floor, noon would be indicated each day as the in-
stant of the day’s shortest shadow. Soon a mark could be made to
indicate the direction of the shadow at every noon, and this would
be the line of north and south. Presently it would appear that the
end of the shadow at noon marched southward from July to Decem-
ber and then returned. A diligent observer, watching this march of
the end of the noon shadow for several seasons, would obtain a more
and more accurate measure of the length of the year. As long ago
as the times of the ancient Chaldeans and Egyptians the year was
thus known to be about 36514 days. If shadow observations were
continued over centuries, as doubtless they were by priests as re-
ligious rites, the fraction approximately one-fourth could be deter-
mined to several decimals.

From the total length of the excursion of the shadow’s end be-
tween June and December, compared to the height of the rod which
east it, the angular inclination of the ecliptic to the Equator was
determined several centures before Christ as 2314°. Eratosthenes,
about two centuries before Christ, went further. He observed that
the sun at midday in Alexandria at the summer solstice stood 1%
of a circumference, or about 7° from the zenith, whereas at Syene,
in Upper Egypt, the sun at the same time stood exactly overhead.
From this he inferred that the distance from Alexandria to Syene
was 14) of the circumference of the earth. His observation agrees
closely with the truth. Another use of the march of the end of the
sun’s shadow from north to south would discover the dates at which
it stood exactly half accomplished. These dates, corresponding to
the equinoxes, would reveal the inequalities of several days which
we now attribute to the ellipticity of the earth’s orbit round the sun.
Latitudes were also readily determined by the ancients from the
direction and length of the sun’s shadow.

But enough! We will not follow the shadow farther but turn
our attention to the astrolabe, the pearl of ancient instruments.
Imagine, if you please, that your watch was expanded in diameter
several fold, and that its chain ended in a loop large enough to hang
on the thumb or finger instead of in a bar or hook. Assume the
weight of the watch increased to 1 or 2 pounds, its glass and
works removed. On the face, instead of hands, would be pivoted
a bar carrying peephole sights at either end, by means of which
the axis of the bar could be pointed at the sun, a star, or at some
terrestrial object. Corresponding to the position of the hours, III
and IX of the watch would be the horizon line. The angle be-
tween the sighting bar and the horizon line could be read off on
the graduated circle. Sighting through such an instrument, held
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

suspended from the upstretched hand, and directed to any point of
the compass, the observer could readily measure the angular differ-
ence of elevation of any two stars, mountains, or other objects by sub-
tracting their respective angular distances above the horizon line.

In addition to these features, the astrolabe had a complex frame,
called the spider, or rete, upon its face. This frame was filled with
points representing the positions of important stars. There were,
besides, a number of metal plates packed within the body of the
instrument. The proper one to suit the observer’s latitude could be
selected and exposed next under the spider. On this plate were drawn
families of curves used for various purposes. For instance, after
measuring the altitude of the sun, a setting could be made whereby
the time of day was given. This setting involved the constellations
of the zodiac which appeared on a circle, also part of the face of the
instrument. On the back of the astrolabe was drawn a system of
cross-section lines so that from any setting of the pointers there could
at once be graphically computed some desired mathematical result.

The astrolabe maintained itself as an instrument of astrology,
astronomy, and navigation for nearly 2,000 years. It was displaced
by the mariner’s sextant, invented by John Hadley about 1731. So
highly was the astrolabe appreciated that it is still spoken of with
regret that so choice an instrument is not quite up to modern require-
ments of accuracy. It is interesting to note that the poet Chaucer
wrote a treatise on the astrolabe and its uses.

Although both the sun dial and the astrolabe were used from
antiquity to tell the time of day, neither they nor the clepsydra, or
water clock, reached the precision needed for fundamental progress
in the theory of astronomy. The positions of the stars are known
when their distances north or south of the celestial equator, that is,
their declinations, are determined, and in addition the times at which
they cross the meridian, which fixes their right ascensions. There-
fore, not only must the astrolabe, or its equivalent, be used to measure
the Sree angular daete above the fees of a star to fix its
declination, but it is no less important to measure the exact time
when the star makes its meridian transit. There was no instrument
in the hands of the ancients which could keep accurate time for 24
hours. An imperfect substitute for a true clock available to the old
astronomers would be to note the relative lengths of clepsydra time
between meridian passages of stars, and reduce this as nearly as pos-
sible to true time by a network of astrolabe measurements of angles
between stars, reduced by trigonometry to east-west projection. The
accuracy ayailable in star positions could not have reached a
thousandth part of present-day precision.
ASTRONOMY IN SHAKESPEARE’S TIME—ABBOT 119

Hipparchus it was who realized the great value to posterity of a
star catalog, and he made one containing 1,080 stars, which, with
Ptolemy’s additions, remained standard for 1,600 years.

It was the making of this catalog of stars which led Hipparchus
to note that certain stars observed by Timocharis and Aristyllus a
century and a half earlier were in his time 2° farther east, measured
from the equinox, than they had been 150 years previously. Thus
he discovered the precession of the equinoxes, and set for it a value
of not less than 36 seconds per annum. Modern observations raise this
to about 50 seconds. The causes were found after Sir Isaac Newton
laid down the law of gravitation. The earth is a great spinning top.
As the attraction of the sun and moon on the earth’s equatorial
bulge tends to bring the equator into the plane of the ecliptic, they
merely set the pole to revolving, just as you do when you try to tip
over a spinning top. The attractions of the planets slightly increase
the effect.

Hipparchus had worked out a fairly satisfactory theory of the
sun’s apparent motion, assuming the earth stationary. It involved
circular orbits only. He was not so successful with the moon’s
motion, and finding the motions of the planets too obscure, he set
himself deliberately to making regular observations of their positions
which could be used by posterity, if not by himself, to ascertain their
true behavior. This altruistic attitude well deserves high praise
for Hipparchus.

Ptolemy, living over three centuries later, expressed the highest
admiration for Hipparchus and employed that master’s observations
and discoveries with those of other philosophers to compose the great
system known as the Ptolemaic, which is described by him in the
Almagest. Ptolemy’s greatest original contribution is in his system
for the moon’s and the planetary motions. Retaining the hypothesis
of circular orbits and assuming a stationary central earth, he required
a very great complexity of cycles, epicycles, eccentrics, deferents,
and equants. He was content with a mathematical system or fiction
by means of which the positions of the planets among the stars
could be predicted. It is not to be supposed that he regarded this
complexity as a real mechanism. In fact, until the rise of Kepler
and Newton, no understanding of the real operation of the solar
system was possible. At the cost of immense labor, and great shrewd-
ness of mathematical analysis, Ptolemy obtained a very fair repre-
sentation of the lunar and planetary motions, as accurate perhaps
as the observations available to him.

Throughout the Middle Ages, Ptolemy was regarded as final au-
thority in astronomical matters, and little was added to the astro-
nomical edifice built up by the Greek philosophers as finished by
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

Ptolemy. The Arab astronomers, Albategnius, Abul Wafa, Ibn
Yunus, Arzabel, Nassir Eddin, and the Tartar, Ulegh Begh, made
some observations of value, computed tables of planetary and other
positions, and kept alive the knowledge of the works of the Greeks.
But they added very little of original discovery to the body of
astronomical knowledge. Indirectly, however, by their introduction
from India of our present system of writing numbers, which we
still call the Arabic notation, they conferred an immense boon upon
astronomy.

Regiomontanus, with his master Purbach and his pupil Walther,
in the latter half of the fifteenth century, published in Nurnberg a
treatise on planetary theory, invented the method of lunar distances
for determining longitude at sea, and published for many years
almanacs giving astronomical information, He was invited to Rome
to reform the calendar, but died there at the age of 40.

Here then we come to the end of the astronomical knowledge of
Shakespeare’s time. The Greeks and earlier observers had proved the
earth and moon to be spheres, and had inferred that the other heav-
enly bodies were spheres also. They had devised means of determin-
ing latitude, the length of the year, the times of the equinoxes and
solstices, and had discovered the periodicity of eclipses. The planets
from Mercury to Saturn were known, and their curious motions in
advance and in retrograde among the stars had been observed for
many centuries. The motions of the sun and moon with respect to the
stars were also long observed. By the theorems of geometry, ampli-
fied by some of the powers of trigonometry, ingenious, yet fatally
complex theories of the celestial motions had been worked out. Such
obscure phenomena as the precession of the equinoxes and the various
inequalities of the apparent motions of the sun and moon had been
discovered.

All of this was done without the telescope or the exact clock. No
sufficient accuracy was possible without them to build a true edifice of
astronomical theory. Neither was the cloud of ignorance so far lifted
as to reveal to most men the improbability of the claims of astrology.
Shakespeare showed his superiority of mind by declining to believe
that twinkling stars could order human destiny. He made use of
other men’s beliefs in astrology, nevertheless, to impart mystery and
awe to dramatic situations. By the happiest references he often used
bits of true or fanciful astronomical lore to make facets of gemlike
brilliancy shine from out his verse. What added beauties he would
have created had he possessed the knowledge of the Universe that awes
us now, it is difficult to imagine.

I have a mind to end this paper gallantly by quoting some lines
from the plays to present Shakespeare’s heavenly outlook vividly.

THE SIZE AND AGE OF THE UNIVERSE*

By Sir JAMsEs JEANS, F. R. S.

[With 2 plates]

Tt has often been said that the history of the race is that of the in-
dividual writ large, and this remark is specially applicable to the
question of the size of the universe. The new-born child is unable to
form an adequate conception of the size of the world, probably because
it takes its cradle or its nursery as its unit of measurement. It was the
same with the human race in its infancy. Taking for granted that the
earth was the central and most important part of the universe, it some-
what naturally supposed that the earth was comparable in size with
the whole universe.

EARLY DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROBLEM

Peering into the dimly lit recesses of early science, we see the gradual
crumbling away of this belief. In the sixth century B. C., Pythagoras
taught that the earth was globular in shape; and in the fourth century
B. C., Heraclides of Pontus explained that the apparent rotation of
the heavens arose from the rotation of this globular earth under the
stars. Such teachings as these inevitably led men to revise their esti-
mates both of the relative size and relative importance of the earth.
In the third century B. C., we find Aristarchus of Samos making the
first attempts to estimate the size of the universe by the really scien-
tific method of exact measurement. He saw that when the moon was
exactly half illuminated, the line from the sun to the moon must be
perpendicular to the line from the moon to the earth. Thus in the
triangle formed by the sun, the earth and the moon, one angle is a right
angle, while another, that at the earth, can readily be measured by
observation taken on earth. In this way Aristarchus hoped to obtain
the relative lengths of the sides of the triangle in question, and so also
the relative distances of the sun and moon.

His theory was perfect, but his observations very faulty. Actually
the angle at the earth differs from a right angle by only about 9

sion from Nature, vol. 137, no. 3453, Jan. 4, 1936.

{24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

minutes of arc. Aristarchus estimated it to be 3°, and so concluded
that the sun was only about 20 times as distant as the moon—actually
it is 400 times as distant.

He also made estimates of the actual distances. Thanks to the
genius of Anaxagoras, the nature of eclipses was already well under-
stood. It was known that the darkness which spreads over the moon
at an eclipse is the shadow of the earth. Aristarchus, knowing that
the sun was many times more distant than the moon, saw that this
shadow must be approximately of the same dimensions as the earth
itself{—it was a circle of the size of the earth seen at the distance of
the moon. Knowing the size of the earth, it was an easy matter to
compute the distance of the moon.

Once again Aristarchus relied on a series of erroneous measures.
He estimated that the earth’s shadow had only twice the diameter of
the moon—actually it has three times this diameter. Also, the moon
subtends an angle of half a degree in the sky, but Aristarchus took
the angle to be 2°, and so got erroneous values for the moon’s distance
as well as for its size. Clearly exact measurement was not his strong
point, yet he was the first to demonstrate the order of magnitude of
astronomical distances.

Aristarchus made an even more important contribution to the
large-scale problems of astronomy. He showed, by reasoning very
similar to that used by Copernicus 1,800 years later, that the earth
revolved in a circular orbit about the sun. He then argued that, as
the fixed stars appeared in spite of this motion to retain fixed places
in the heavens, they must be at immeasurably great distances from
the earth, saying that the distances of these stars “bore the same rela-
tion to the earth’s orbit as the radius of a sphere bears to its center”—
in other words, the whole solar system was a mere point in the immen-
sity of space.

I need scarcely remind you how, in the second century after Christ,
these enlightened views were challenged and temporarily vanquished
by Ptolemy of Alexandria. Ptolemy argued that if the earth were
rotating, objects at the Equator would be in the most violent rotation,
and so would fly off into space, since “matter which is in violent rota-
tion does not seem fit to be massed together, but rather dispersed.”
He went on to say that “long before now the disintegrated parts of
the earth would have been dissipated over the heavens themselves,
which is very ridiculous.” He also said that, if the earth were rotat-
ing, a stone dropped to earth would not reach its destined place, be-
cause the earth would be moving eastward under it all the time it
was falling. He said further that if the earth were rotating, the
clouds would move over our heads from east to west as a conseauence
of this rotation. Clearly he had never stood in the track of the
SIZE AND AGE OF THE UNIVERSE—JEANS 125

trade-winds and seen the clouds moving in endless procession from
east to west as a result of the very rotation he was trying to discredit.

It was not until 1543 that these arguments were refuted by Coperni-
cus. Ptolemy’s argument had been that the earth cannot be rotating,
because if it were it would fly to pieces; thus the nightly motion of the
stars must result from the rotation of the heavens themselves. Yet, if
the whole heavens rotated once every 24 hours, they must have an even
higher tangential velocity than he, Copernicus, wished to attribute to
the earth. Why then, asks Copernicus, do not the heavens themselves
fly to pieces? It was a shrewd thrust, but Copernicus was betrayed
into pursuing his stricken enemy too far. For he went on to inquire
whether the heavens really could be expanding under the centrifugal
force of their rotation; and his argument has a strange ring of 1935
about it. He scornfully asks what the heavens could possibly be ex-
panding into, for as they are the whole universe, there can be no
space beyond them into which they could expand.

The theories of Copernicus fared better than those of Aristarchus,
the two principal reasons for their greater success being that printing
and the telescope had been invented in the meantime. Two-thirds
of a century after Copernicus published his book, the telescope of
Galileo had virtually established the truth of his doctrines, and the
sun replaced the earth as the fundamental unit of the universe. Ten
years before Galileo had looked through his first telescope, Giordano
Bruno was maintaining that the stars were similar objects to the
earth, moon, and planets—as Pythagoras had conjectured 2,000 years
before. Ten years after, Kepler was saying that they must be similar
objects to the sun; and this led to the first real comprehension of the
immensity of space. For, if the stars were intrinsically as bright as
the sun, they must be at stupendous distances to look so much fainter
than the sun. We receive approximately 100,000 million times as
much light from the sun as we do from a first-magnitude star such as
Altair, Betelgeux, or Aldebaran. Thus, if these stars are comparable
with the sun in luminosity, they must needs be about 320,000 times
as distant—no smaller distance would be compatible with their faint-
ness. In modern terminology, these first-magnitude stars would be
at distances of approximately 11 parsecs or 5 light-years.

We know now that this method of calculation cannot lead to
very accurate results, at any rate in its present crude form, because
the supposition that the stars are all of the same candlepower as the
sun is very far from the truth—some have more than 10,000 times the
candlepower of the sun, while others have less than a ten-thousandth
part. But the method admits of almost endless refinement, and in
its modern form provides the most useful, and indeed almost the only,
method for estimating the distances of very remote objects.
126 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

THE MODERN METHOD OF ATTACK

The stars fall into clearly defined categories. As an unassorted
whole, they exhibit an enormous range in candlepower, but all the
stars in any one category are of approximately the same candle-
power, so that we can obtain a reasonably good estimate of a star’s
distance by considering its apparent brightness in conjunction with
the category into which it falls. For the majority of stars, the cate-
gory is determined mainly by the star’s spectrum, but in the case
of variable stars, the period of variability is even more important
than the spectrum, and leads to results of far greater precision.

To take an instance of the simplest kind, the star Sirius, which
looks the brightest in the whole sky, is one of those nearer stars whose
distance can be determined by ordinary trigonometrical methods—
methods which are the same in principle as those which the sur-
veyor uses to determine the distance of an inaccessible mountain peak.
The whole process is, of course, conducted on an enormously larger
scale; the surveyor takes a base-line a few miles long on the earth’s
surface and finds his mountain is a few miles distant, while the as-
tronomer takes as his base-line the diameter of the earth’s orbit round
the sun—a base-line 186,000,000 miles long—and finds that his star is
many millions of millions of miles distant. In this way he finds
that the distance of Sirius is 51 million million miles, or 8.65 light-
years. Knowing this, we can estimate the distance of all stars which
belong to the same category as Sirius; for example, a similar star
which looks 100 times less bright must be 10 times as distant, because
light falls off as the square of the distance.

Variable stars provide a more reliable method of estimating
astronomical distances. For example, the star 5 Cephei is found by
the ordinary surveyor’s method to be about 60 times as distant as
Sirius. All stars which have the same period of variability as 5
Cephei are found to have about the same candlepower, so that again
their distance can be estimated from their faintness. As these
variable stars are enormously bright, they can be seen to immense
distances—hence their special value as indicators of astronomical
distance.

We can test these methods in various ways. The obvious one is
to find a group of stars which are already known to be all at the
same distance, and see whether each of the stars tells the same story
as to the distance of the group. Such groups of stars are to be
found in the globular clusters, the Magellanic clouds, and in the
nearer of the extragalactic nebulae.

In these last objects, even the vivid Cepheid variables look very
faint. Nevertheless they are visible, and their feeble brightness can
be measured with considerable accuracy in a large telescope. In this
SIZE AND AGE OF THE UNIVERSE—JEANS 127

way we find that the distance of the nearest of these nebulae is about
770,000 light-years,

This is the nebula M33 in the constellation Triangulum. The
second nearest nebula is the well-known “Great” nebula in Androm-
eda; this is at a distance about 8 percent greater. In this last
nebula, no fewer than 40 Cepheid variables can be detected, but as we
pass to more distant nebulae, the number of identifiable Cepheids nat-
urally decreases, and this particular method becomes less reliable.
Finally it fails altogether through the impossibility of discovering
Cepheid variables at all.

Yet many stars are even brighter than Cepheid variables, and
these enable us to carry on with the same method to even greater
distances.

In table 1, the second column shows the distances of eight near
objects as determined from the Cepheid variables observed in them.
The last column shows the candlepower of the brightest stars ob-
served in these objects, that of the sun being taken as unity.

With one exception, the brightest star in each of these objects
has about 20,000 times the candlepower of the sun. Now stars can
be identified in 40 nebulae in all, and if we assume that in each
of these the brightest star has about 20,000 times the candlepower of
the sun, we can immediately estimate the distance of these nebulae
also,

We have been gradually moving farther out into space, and if we
still continue our journey, we come in time to nebulae in which even
the brightest of stars are invisible. How then can we discover the
distances of these nebulae ?

The answer is that the nebulae—like the stars—appear to be built
to pattern. When two stars show the same spectrum and the same
period of variability, they belong to the same category, and are of
approximately the same candlepower. In the same way, when two
nebulae show the same build—the same shape and distribution of
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

relative brightness—they are of approximately the same candle-
power. We reach this conclusion from a study of the nearer nebulae,
whose distance can be ascertained, and then assume that it is true
of the farther nebulae also. Thus the faintness of the nebulae gives
a measure of their distance, and in this way we can estimate the
distances of even the faintest of visible nebulae.

THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE

Using this method, we find that the faintest nebulae which are
visible in our telescopes are at a distance of about 240 million light-
years. Before we proceed further, let us try to see all this in pro-
portion—let us make a small-scale model on the scale of 2 million
jight-years to the inch. Then our visible universe will be a sphere
20 feet in diameter. Our galaxy is a small disk of the size of an
average pinhead—perhaps one-tenth inch in diameter. The naked-
eye stars are all contained in a sphere of about one six-hundredth
inch radius—a mere speck of dust. Our sun is a single electron,
and the earth is a millionth part of an electron.

There is no reason to suppose that this sphere of 240 million light-
years radius contains the whole of the universe; we may be sure that
a larger telescope would show still fainter, and, therefore, still remoter
nebulae, so that there is no means of fixing the total size of the
universe—if it has a finite size—in this way. We must turn to other,
and less direct, methods.

RELATIVITY THEORY AND THE UNIVERSE

According to the theory of relativity, space curves back into itself,
so that the total volume of space is finite—just as the total area of
the earth’s surface is finite. If the earth’s surface were plane, the
area within a distance # of any given point, say Charing Cross, would
be exactly proportional to x’. But, because of the curvature of the
earth’s surface, the actual area increases less rapidly than 2. A circle
1 mile in radius has an area of 3.1416 square miles, but a circle 100
miles in radius has an area of less than 31,416 square miles. If space
is curved in a similar way, the volume of space which lies within a
distance w of the earth would increase less rapidly than 2’, so that if
the nebulae are uniformly distributed in space, the number of nebulae
would also increase less rapidly than a’.

Efforts are being made at Mount Wilson to examine whether the
number of nebulae falls off in this way at great distances, but so far
the number appears to vary approximately as the cube of the dis-
tance—there are no signs of falling off as yet. Indeed, preliminary
statistics which have only reached Great Britain within the last few
days seem to indicate the exact reverse. This may perhaps mean that

SIZE AND AGE OF THE UNIVERSE—JEANS 129

we live in a part of the universe which is only sparsely filled with
nebulae, so that we come to a greater density of nebulae when we go
far from home. But a more likely interpretation is that the present
observational material is inadequate for statistical treatment. We
may hope that the new 200-inch telescope will solve the problem for
us in due course. In the meantime, the only inference that we may
legitimately draw from our present telescopic observations is that, in
all probability, the nebulae extend very much further than the 240
million light-years to which our telescopes can penetrate.

If the effect just mentioned had been observed, it might have been
possible to form an estimate of the total volume of space. As this
method is not available, we must fall back on other, and less reKable,
methods.

According to an earlier form of the theory of relativity, there was
a quite simple relation between the total volume of space and the
average density of matter in space. Unhappily, it is not easy to
estimate the density of matter in space with any accuracy, but it is
at least possible to assign upper and lower limits between which it
must lie. This, of course, leads to upper and lower limits for the
total volume of space; and calculation showed that if this theory were
sound, space was immense in comparison with that part to which our
telescopes can reach. The 240 million light-years to the farthest
visible nebulae is only a minute fraction—perhaps a three hundredth
part—of the radius of space. Or, to say the same thing in another
way, light takes 240 million years to travel from the farthest visible
nebulae to us, but would take 500,000 million years to complete the
journey round space and get back to its starting point.

This particular development of the theory of relativity has fallen
into disfavor of recent years; it is still possible that it may give a
rough approximation to the truth, but it seems quite certain that it is
not the whole truth. Other theories have suggested radii of space of
about 2,000 and 10,000 million light-years respectively, but it is hard
to feel much confidence in these estimates. All that we can say with
any confidence is that the dimensions of space are probably far greater
than the 240 million light-years to which our telescopic eyes can see.
Kinstein’s latest conjecture is that space may after all, his earlier
theories notwithstanding, be of literally infinite dimensions.

THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE

The question of the age of the universe is of a somewhat different
nature. ‘There are a great number of different ways of estimating
this age; none of them are completely trustworthy, and unhappily
they appear to lead to inconsistent results. Stated in its crudest
and most obvious form, the problem is, of course, that of examining
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

how far we can trace back the universe into the past, and it is
perhaps not surprising that the further we go the less certainty we
find.

The big telescope at Mount Wilson shows us objects in space whose
light has taken 240 million years to reach us. When we turn the
telescope on to these objects we see them, not as they are now, but
as they were 240 million years ago. These parts of the universe,
then, must have been in existence 240 million years ago, and we seem
justified in concluding that the universe as a whole is more than
240 million years old. Not only so, but these distant parts of space
are occupied by objects which do not differ in essentials from those
nearer home, from which it seems safe to conclude that the universe
has not altered greatly in the past 240 million years; in other words,
this period is only a small part of the evolutionary life of the
universe, so that the age of the universe is probably many times
240 million years.

A study of our own earth confirms this conclusion. Geology can
reconstruct for us the physical conditions of 240 million years ago,
and we see that, broadly speaking, they were very similar to those
prevailing today. This not only shows that the earth is more than
240 million years old, but also that the sun has changed but little
in the past 240 million years. Thus the sun, and so also the universe
of which the sun forms part, must probably have an age of many
times 240 million years.

By analyzing the radioactive properties of rocks of various kinds
in the crust of the earth, we can discover the length of time which
has elapsed since these various rocks solidified. The oldest rocks
of all show ages ranging up to 1,750 million years since solidification.
Thus we may safely conclude that the universe is at least 1,750
millions of years old.

THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE

For the next piece of evidence, we must return to the extreme
depths of space. We believe the great extragalactic nebulae to be
galaxies of stars generally similar to our own, and these are found
to be receding from our galaxy with immense speeds—the largest
speeds we encounter in astronomy, apart from the velocity of light.
The greatest so far observed is 42,000 kilometers a second, which
is one-seventh of the velocity of light. It is found to be a general
rule that the most distant nebulae are receding the most rapidly,
and the speeds of the various nebulae are proportional to their
distances from us. This is shown in figure 1, which embodies results
recently obtained by Hubble and Humason at Mount Wilson. The
abscissae represent the distances of various nebulae and groups of
SIZE AND AGE OF THE UNIVERSE—JEANS 131

nebulae at distances ranging up to about 40 million parsecs (130
million light-years) ; the ordinates represent the observed velocities
of recession of these nebulae expressed in kilometers per second.
It is at once seen that the velocities are very approximately pro-
portional to the distances of the nebulae.

The theory of relativity provides a very simple explanation of
these observed motions of the extragalactic nebulae, and of the law
obeyed by the speeds of the nebulae at different distances. It is,
in brief, that space itself is uniformly expanding, and that the

nebulae embedded in it indicate the motions of space, much as
floating straws indicate the currents in a stream. If this is the true
explanation, then the nebular motions show that space is at present
expanding at such a rate that its linear dimensions double every
2,000 million years—which, let us notice in passing, is just about
the probable age of the earth. But the theory of relativity goes
further than this, and tells us that space is very unlikely to expand
continually at a uniform rate. Certain assumptions suggest that
the expansion increases, approximately at least, in geometrical pro-
gression with the time. If this is the true law, then the present
nebular motions show that space doubles its linear dimensions every
1,400 million years. In other words, 1,400 million years ago space
had only half its present linear dimensions; 2,800 million years ago
only a quarter of its present linear dimensions; and so on.
1120593710
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

We must not, however, go on in this way forever. It would take
an infinity of time to reduce space to a point, but this is unimportant,
for obviously we must not reduce space to a point; we must stop
somewhere before we reach that stage. Detailed mathematical in-
vestigations, too complicated even to summarize here, seem to suggest
that space cannot have been expanding for more than about 160,000
million years. This figure is, however, very uncertain, and in any
case provides no conclusive evidence as to the age of the universe.
lor mathematical investigation also shows that the present period
of expansion may well have been preceded by a period of contrac-
tion. Indeed the mathematical equations admit of solutions of two
different types. In one, the present epoch of expansion is preceded
by an earlier epoch of contraction, and no limits can be set to the
possible duration of this. In the other, the present epoch of expan-
sion is only one of a great number of epochs of regularly alternating
contractions and expansions, and no limit can be set to the possible
number of these epochs. ‘This line of discussion, then, can tell us
nothing definite as to the age of the universe.

It may, of course, be argued that, even though definite evidence is
lacking, considerations of probability fix a probable limit to the age
of the universe. The general line of argument would be that in the
last 1,000 million years, the dimensions of space have changed very
appreciably—probably by about 60 percent—so that the time-scale of
change is one of thousands of millions of years, and it is likely that
the total age must also be measured in terms of thousands of millions
of years. To take a parallel instance, if a zoologist captured a new
kind of animal, of entirely unknown species, and found that its
weight increased by 60 percent in a month, he would probably con-
clude, rightly or wrongly, that the creature was not many months
old. If a tree increases its height by 60 percent in a year, the bot-
anist may be fairly sure that it is not many years old. The argu-
ment undeniably carries some weight, but we must be careful not to
overrate it. In brief, we must remember that the universe is neither
an animal nora tree. The population of England has increased by
60 percent in the last half-century, but we should not be justified in
concluding that England is only a few half-centuries old. The
brightness of the star Mira Ceti has changed by about 60 percent in
the last month, but we must not conclude that Mira Ceti cannot be
more than a few months old. Thus general considerations of prob-
ability can at best give a presumption, and not a very strong one at
that.

THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS

Another line of argument, which seems to me far more convincing
than the foregoing, leads to very different conclusions. If I set a
SIZE AND AGE OF THE UNIVERSE—JEANS 133

pendulum swinging, it comes to rest after a short time. It has been
reduced to rest by its continued impact with molecules of air; in
brief, it has shared its energy with these molecules.

Actual experiment may show that this pendulum comes to rest in
a few minutes, but I could calculate this out without experiment.
All I need to know is the size and weight of the pendulum, and the
density of the air in which it swings. Thus if I come into the room
and find the pendulum swinging vigorously, I can conclude, from
purely abstract calculations, that it has not been swinging for many
minutes; it must have been set into motion only a few minutes ago.
But if I find that it is at rest, and that hundreds of other similar
pendulums are also at rest, I can conclude that they have stood un-
disturbed for many minutes—they may previously have been in
motion, but if so, they have already shared their energy with the
surrounding molecules of air.

This tendency to sharing energy pervades the whole of physics
and prevails also in astronomy. ‘The laws which govern the motions
of the stars show that these also must share their energies with one
another, and if they have been left undisturbed for a sufficiently
long time, this sharing of energy will be complete. We can calculate
how long a time is needed for the process to be effected, and it proves
to be a matter of millions of millions of years. Thus if we find that
the stars have already shared their energy, we know that they must
be millions of millions of years old.

The method admits of greater refinements. Suppose I have a row
of pendulums of different sizes and weights, one of which comes
approximately to rest in 2 minutes, while the next requires 4 minutes,
others require 6, 8, 10, and 12 minutes, respectively. Suppose a
cataclysm of some kind occurs—say, an earthquake—and after a time
I come into the room and find that the 2, 4, and 6 minute pendulums
have already come to rest, while the 8, 10, and 12 minute pendulums
are still swinging with varying degrees of force. It is reasonzble to
conclude that the cataclysm occurred between 6 and 8 minutes ago.
With a sufficient number of pendulums, it might be possible to fix
the time with considerable precision.

Now the different kinds of stars form just such a range of pendu-
lums. Fortunately, they share their energies at very different rates.
When we proceed to observation, we find that in actual fact some
types of stars have already shared their energies almost completely,
both with other stars and with one another; for other types the
process has barely begun. This is shown in the three following
tables.

Table 2 is concerned with observations of 116 stars;-for 83 the
eccentricity of orbit is less than 0.6, and for 38 stars it is greater than
0.6. The last column shows the statistical distribution of eccentrici-
ties we should find in a group of stars in which the process of energy-
sharing was complete, the group being chosen to be of such a size
that there are again 83 stars of eccentricity less than 0.6. A compari-
son of this and the preceding column shows that the energy-sharing
process is fairly complete up to eccentricity 0.6, but that for eccen-
tricities higher than 0.6, there is very little evidence of energy-shar-
ing. These stars of high eccentricity correspond to very slow “pen-
dulums”, but we must not overlook that our table may be incomplete
on the observational side, since binary stars of eccentricity greater
than about 0.6 are difficult to detect and still more difficult to measure.

The visual binaries of eccentricity less than about 0.6 form a range
of pendulums in which the process of energy-sharing requires a time
of millions of millions of years. In another class of binary stars, the
spectroscopic binaries, the components lie much closer together—so
close in fact that the gravitational forces from other stars have very
little effect in modifying their orbits. In these stars, the process of
energy-sharing is a matter of hundreds of millions of millions of
years at least. Table 3 contains statistics as to the orbits of these
stars. We see at once that there is no appreciable sharing of energy.

SIZE AND AGE OF THE UNIVERSE—JEANS 135

Finally, the linear motions of ordinary single stars provide yet
another range of “pendulums.” We know that the molecules in a
gas tend to share their energy, until finally all types of molecules, big
and small, light and heavy, have, on the average, the same amount of
energy. In the same way the stars tend to share their energy, and
groups of stars of different masses form a range of pendulums, the
most massive stars sharing their energy most slowly and the lightest
the most rapidly.

Table 4 gives the average linear velocities of stars of different
masses as determined by Seares at Mount Wilson. We see that all
except the most massive stars are well on toward equipartition of
energy, all having an average energy which is not very far from
3,750 in the units we are using.

These and various other “pendulums” agree in suggesting that we
must assign to the universe an age of 5 to 10 millions of millions of
years,

THE SOURCE OF STELLAR ENERGY

Let us now consider the state of things 5 millions of millions of
years ago. Observation shows that the sun is at present radiating
energy away at the rate of about 250 million tons a minute. This
time yesterday, then, it weighed 360,000 million tons more than now.
A million million years ago, it weighed a very great, but still calcula-
ble, number of tons more than now; it was about 6 percent more mus-
sive than now; and, because of this, it was also a brighter star than
now, radiating not 250 million tons a minute, but about 300 million
tons a minute. After adjusting our calculations for such considera-
tions as this, we find that 5 million million years ago, the sun was
probably many times as massive as now and many times as bright. In
the intervening period, it has been gradually getting rid of its mass

in the form of radiation, until it is reduced to a mere relic of its
former magnificance.
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

A few years ago, it was difficult to believe that the sun could pro-
duce its radiation by the actual annihilation of its substance, but in
these few years the short-lived positive electron, or “positron”, has
been detected in the laboratory. This has given us every reason for
thinking that the transformation of matter into radiation is contin-
ually going on in ordinary terrestrial matter, as well as the converse
process of the creation of matter out of the energy of radiation. With
this source of energy to call on, there is no longer any objection to our
assigning ages of millions of millions of years to the stars.

It was not easy to visualize the vastness of astronomical space, and
it is even less easy to conceive of the immensity of astronomical time.
A fairly lengthy book contains about 200,000 words averaging five
letters each. Let us take the whole of such a book to represent. the
age of the earth. Then the whole of civilization is represented by
the last word or two, and the whole of the Christian era by something
less than the last letter. A single lifetime is a good deal less than
the final full stop with which the book ends. Such is the age of
our own planet, and, whatever view we take, the age of the whole
universe, on the same scale, is a matter of volumes. If the view
I put forward last is correct, it must be represented by a library of
some thousands of volumes.

THE EARTH, THE SUN, AND SUNSPOTS?

By Lorine B. ANDREWS

Instructor in Astronomy and Executive Secretary of the Harvard Observatory

[With 2 plates]

About thrice a year there lies upon my desk a letter which typi-
cally reads in the following fashion: “I would greatly appreciate
it if you could send me a list of dates of maximum and minimum
sunspot activity running back to around 1850. I believe I have dis-
covered a correlation between sunspot activity and business activity,
but, inasmuch as I have been unable to get the sunspot periods accu-
rately, I am unable to carry the correlation back over a sufficiently
long period of time. I would greatly appreciate any help you can
give me along these lines.”

This letter is the stimulus to take once again from the observatory’s
library the volume I have so frequently fingered, the Astronomische
Mitteilungen of the Ziirich Observatory, to open it at no. 132, page
67, and to extract therefrom the list of sunspot maxima and minima
for as long a period of time as the writer requests. I find, for example,
that since 1900 there has been maximum spottedness at the following
times: 1906.4, 1917.6, and 1928.4; and minimum spottedness at 1901.7,
1913.6, 1923.6, and 1933.8. An arithmetician will inform you that these
figures tell of a variation of spottedness of the sun possessing a pe-
riod of 10.8 years, or, as one commonly states it, a period of 11 years.
A further perusal of the table—and it lists the maxima and minima
back to 1610—reveals that this period is not reproduced with clock-
like precision. One notes a minimum interval of 7.3 years and a
maximum interval of 15.0 years. In fact the long-term average for
the period of sunspot variation is 11.13 years. Other idiosyncrasies
are noted in the heights of maxima and the depths of minima.

The average person of today is endowed with sufficient intelligence
to avoid looking directly at the sun without protection for the eyes.
Yet it was not always so. We are informed that the very early Chi-
nese astronomers observed the sun with the naked eye and discovered

137
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

thereon large black areas, blemishes on the face of a perfect, luminous
sphere. Today one may with fair frequency similarly observe with
the naked eye dark areas on the surface of the sun, provided the eye
is suitably protected by a piece of dark glass or an overexposed bit
of photographic film. These dark areas are the sunspots, imperma-
nent markings, subject to the variation in number previously out-
lined. They represent evidence of some deep-lying solar activity,
the exact nature of which astronomers do not yet know.

Research has conclusively demonstrated that sunspots are huge
solar cyclones, whirlwinds in the solar atmosphere, accompanied by
pronounced magnetic conditions. Each sunspot, assumedly as the
result of the whirling of electrically charged particles within it, is
a huge magnet. Each such disturbed area of the solar atmosphere
may be simple or complex in appearance. One speaks of single
spots, the ultimate state of simplicity; of bipolar groups, whereby
is meant, in general, two neighboring disturbances, the one preced-
ing, the other following, along a solar parallel of latitude; and of
complex groups, of which the name is adequately descriptive. The
magnetic polarities of the individual centers of activity within an
area follow certain general rules that become of increasing complex-
ity of application as one proceeds from single spots to the complex
groups.

Sunspots have been termed impermanent markings. Inasmuch as
they are of the nature of solar cyclones, they should be as imperma-
nent as their terrestrial counterpart. The average life of a dis-
turbance of this nature is 2 or 8 months. The longest-lived spot on
record is that of the years 1840 and 1841, which persisted for 18
months. The shortest-lived disturbance is usually of but a few
hours’ duration.

Such a variable phenomenon requires daily observation, even as
daily records are made of terrestrial weather. It is t6 a certain
extent the equivalent of keeping a daily account of the solar weather,
though there is no attempt at a detailed prediction of what the
morrow will bring. It is for this reason that one activity of the
Department of Astronomy at Harvard has been the daily photog-
raphy of the sun, when the weather permits, a procedure that has
been followed since the autumn of 1926. To the present over 1,800
photographs have been filed.

Some attempts have been made to ascertain whether certain re-
gions of the solar surface represent weak areas wherein sunspots
are most likely to reoccur. The results are but poorly supported by
the direct evidence. Of one result, however, astronomers are com-
pletely certain. Sunspots occur only within certain limits of solar
latitude. Beyond the confines of the two belts defined on the ap-
SUNSPOTS—ANDREWS 139

parent solar surface by solar latitudes 6° and 40°, the one in the
Northern Hemisphere, the other in the Southern, spots but rarely
occur. The first spots of a new outburst of solar activity appear
near the high latitudes of the belts, and, as the cycle progresses
toward maximum spottedness, the average latitude of these dis-
turbances progresses constantly toward the lower solar latitudes,
reaching the value of 15° at maximum, and continuing onward
toward the lower limits of the belts as the cycle declines toward
minimum. Thereafter the first evidence of a new cycle is the reap-
pearance of spots near the upper limits of the belts. The causes
of this behavior of spots, as well as of the variations of their mag-
netic properties, are still clothed in mystery.

The aim of this article is, however, not to recount the properties
of sunspots as such. Given this manifestation of solar activity, our
interest lies in the determination of any possible terrestrial influence.
The presence of huge magnetic fields in sunspots results in their
acting as howitzers to pour forth charged particles of matter into
the interplanetary realm. If the earth is in the range of the how-
itzer, its atmosphere is the recipient of these particles, and, beyond
doubt, electrical phenomena should occur there. The rotation of the
sun on its axis in a period of some 25 days prevents the earth’s
being constantly in the range of a sunspot or sunspot group, and
so we look for the evidence of a terrestrial effect primarily when a
spot lies near the center of the sun as seen from the earth. When
this state of affairs is valid, such terrestrial phenomena as auroral
displays, magnetic storms, and effects on long distance radio reception
should occur, for they all depend upon the electrical conditions of
the atmosphere; and indeed our expectations are fulfilled. All three
phenomena show a close correlation with sunspot activity and par-
ticularly with the passage of an active sunspot group across the
central area of the sun’s disk; the aurorae, borealis and australis,
perform beautifully, magnetic compasses oscillate to and fro over
a small amplitude centered at their normal position, and long dis-
tance radio reception is either improved or hampered. In connection
with the last of these it should be said that whether reception is
improved or hampered depends upon the wave length of the signals
and other factors related to radio transmission.

The assumed validity of a correlation of electrical phenomena on
the earth and sunspot activity is thus established in a straight-fur-
ward manner. The many additional correlations, inchiding the cor-
relation of sunspot activity with weather conditions, the receipt of
rabbit pelts, wars, floods, international crises, economic tranquillity
and distress, the growth of trees, even with volcanic activity, hardly
fall, however, within the category of terrestrial electrical phenomena.

Yet sunspot activity apparently correlates with these terrestrial activ-
ities, and the source of the correlation must be sought in other solar
phenomena that are correlated in turn with sunspot activity.

Among the solar phenomena which might possibly have an in-
fluence on things terrestrial are the intensity of the solar radiation
and the nature of the ight which the sun sends earthward. Both
of these are found to correlate with sunspot activity. At the times
of sunspot maximum the earth’s receipt of heat from the sun in-
creases over nomal and, when the sunspots are at a minimum, the
heat received is below normal. Surely this change in the receipt
of warmth by the earth should be noticeable. One would expect
that the increased receipt of heat would result in a generally higher
terrestrial temperature and a slackened heat input with a generally
lower terrestrial temperature, but this is not so. The relationship
is exactly the reverse, at least so far as accurate measurements of
temperature on the earth are available. The theory commonly
given to explain this apparent anomaly is as follows: Increased heat
radiation from the sun entails a higher degree of warmth of the earth.
High temperatures are, however, conducive of increased evapora-
tion from the water-covered areas of the earth with a resulting
higher water-vapor content of the earth’s atmosphere. Inasmuch as
clouds are the results of the condensation of water vapor, its higher
percentage should result in the prevalence of clouds as well as in
increased rainfall. Both evaporation and rainfall are cooling
phenomena. The net result should be that, when the earth is receiv-
ing the greatest amount of heat from the sun, surface temperatures
on the earth would be below normal. When the earth’s receipt of
heat from the sun is at a minimum, the terrestrial effects are the
reciprocal of those at sunspot maximum, and terrestrial tempera-
tures should be above normal. A number of correlations are sug-
gested by this line of reasoning. There should be a correlation be-
tween sunspots and the prevalence of clouds on the earth, such that
at sunspot maximum, cloudiness should be at a maximum too, while
at sunspot minimum, cloudiness should be at a minimum. At sun-
spot maximum, rainfall should be at a maximum, at sunspot mini-
mum, it should be at a minimum. Of course, it is necessary to inject
a word of caution, namely, that terrestrial weather, considered in
detail, is such an uncertain affair that to differentiate a strictly solar
effect from the multitude of terrestrial effects is not the easiest task
imaginable.

The ideas of the last paragraph would seem to offer a clue to long-
range weather forecasting with a somewhat higher degree of validity
than that with which it is done in certain almanacs of wide circula-
tion. There does seem to be a general agreement among meteor-
SUNSPOTS—ANDREWS 141

ologists that solar influences dominate the weather situation of the
earth, and the attempts being made at present to discover the clue
to long-range weather forecasting have their basis in the study of
the output of heat from the sun.

The second correlation between a solar phenomenon and sunspot
variation is that of the ultraviolet content of the sun’s radiation. At
times of sunspot maximum the percentage of ultraviolet radiation
from the sun reaches a maximum; at sunspot minimum, it is at a
minimum. In this correlation lies the clue to a large number of
terrestrial effects. The biological effects of ultraviolet light might
form the subject of a thesis by a biologist. In general, I believe,
the thesis would hold that ultraviolet light is conducive of good
health; at least, such reasoning has resulted in the fad of sun bathing,
either for the acquisition of bodily tone or for the acquisition of a
fashionable bodily tan. One might suggest that it is most economi-
cal to acquire a coat of tan at times of sunspot maximum, for then
the ultraviolet content of sunlight, the motivating factor in the crea-
tion of tan, is at a maximum and the desired coat may be acquired in
the minimum interval of time.

The influence of ultraviolet light upon plant life is that of stim-
ulating growth, though it must be admitted that frequent rains will
also assist the weeds to grow luxuriantly amid the prouder foliage
of your garden. If you will grant the earlier theory that rainfall
should be at a maximum at the time of sunspot maximum, then the
coupling of frequent rains with the maximum receipt of ultraviolet
radiation should manifest itself in plant life on the earth. A very
simple manner of testing the hypothesis is by the study of the growth
of trees. Even as little children we learn that a tree adds a ring
each year, so that, by sawing down the old pine tree and counting
rings backward from the bark, it is possible to tell its age. The
theory would indicate that at times of sunspot maximum the width
of the ring should be greater than at times of sunspot minimum
or at intermediate times. The correlation is so good that Prof.
A. E. Douglass, of the University of Arizona, has used it to deter-
mine the antiquity of the Indian ruins in the southwestern areas of
the United States, and for carrying back our records of sunspot
activity prior to the time of satisfactory man-made records of it.
Sample cross-sectional borings of the timbers used in the construc-
tion of these dwellings show patterns of ring widths that are re-
produced time and again. Comparisons with the cross-sections of
recently felled patriarchs of the neighboring wooded areas and cor-
relation with recorded observations of sunspot activity have enabled
Professor Douglass to carry back his studies of tree-ring cycles to
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

the point where it is possible to date the timbers used in these ancient
dwellings.

The biological effects of ultraviolet light may be such as to stimu-
late certain animals to the creation of large litters, which will ac-
count for the fact the number of rabbit pelts returned to the whole-
salers by the trappers becomes a maximum near the time of sunspot
maximum. It is not a case of greater activity on the part of the
trappers, but rather a case of more rabbits to be trapped. On the
other hand, ultraviolet light is a penetrating radiation that seeps
under the cuticle of human beings and stimulates the nervous sys-
tem, thereby arousing the individual to unusual heights of activity
and achievement. With trappers thus excited in their work, it is
hardly possible for the cause of their enthusiasm to remain safe;
hence the usual number of rabbits may exist, but there is more
enthusiastic trapping.

Ultraviolet radiation, as has been previously suggested, is an excit-
ing radiation. That large proportion of it which is not intercepted
by trees, plants, and human beings must of necessity find its way
into the earth. Whether it can be as exciting of inanimate objects as
it appears to be of animate ones is an open question. Yet there seems
to be some evidence, perhaps entirely of a coincidental nature, that
volcanic activity correlates with sunspot activity. Disturb the under-
layers of the earth’s crust by an excess dose of ultraviolet radiation
and they may find relief by discharging their excess energy as a
volcanic eruption.

Already it has been stated that ultraviolet radiation is a stimulant
to human beings; it may at the same time be an irritant. A Rus-
sian scientist suggested not many years ago, and I have seen the
same statement made independently at a more recent time, that great
international crises, such as wars, peace treaties, and other evidences
of international amity or friction, follow the period of sunspot activ-
ity with some fidelity. The basis for such a correlation may be
sought in the stimulating effects of ultraviolet light, prodding states-
men to great international concords, or, in its irritating effects, an-
noying them until they come to blows. The sole difficulty with the
correlation and with its theoretical explanation is that the world
seems to be in a state of international upheaval at almost any hour
in any year.

A correlation of great human interest is that of sunspot activity
with stock market transactions and with the price of grain, wheat,
cotton, and other major items of exchange, the oft-discovered cor-
relation that prompts such letters as that quoted at the beginning of
this article. It is conceivable that the stimulating effects of ultra-
violet radiation upon humans should have much to do with the periods
of prosperity and depression, and with the flux of prices, not only

of stocks and bonds, but of staple commodities. Those who bear the ©
brunt of furnishing advice to investors and wholesalers have been |
enthusiastic in their search for such a correlation between solar activ-_
ity and terrestrial activity. Needless to say, they have found evidence
of such a correlation. As the number of sunspots mounts, prosperity
turns the corner; as the number of sunspots diminishes, prosperity
hides itself in a depression. It may be pointed out that the last
sunspot maximum occurred in 1928, an epoch in the economic history
of the United States to which one commonly refers as “the good old
days.” The last sunspot minimum occurred in 19338. Someone has
mentioned an economic depression similarly dated. It is now said that
conditions are improving and that prosperity is again just around the
corner; sunspots are improving in number as well. The correlation
seems amazingly satisfactory, and its amazing properties are en-
hanced by the fact that it holds equally gocd over nearly the past two
centuries, If you have faith in this relationship, you may heed the
advice of the lyrics which runs, “Now’s the time to buy, so let’s have
another cup of coffee and let’s have another piece of pie.” Whether
the lyrical prediction apples also to other fields is left to your own
judgment. It would at least seem that all the king’s horses and all
the king’s men cannot bring prosperity back again; but the sun can.

It may justifiably be said that the terrestrial influences of ultra-
violet radiation may be expected at times to be immediate, at other
times, cumulative. This is shown by the coincidence or lag of the ter-
restrial curve with respect to the sunspot curve in the accompanying
diagram.

The present waxing of sunspots should come to an end in 1989.
Concerning some of the concomitant effects we are certain. Concern-
ing the remaining effects your prediction of their trend is as satis-
factory as mine. I have laid them before you, here and there in
serious fashion, elsewhere with a touch of cynicism. To you is left
the final judgment as to when this cynicism is justified.

THE LOWER AIR

Before considering the upper atmosphere it may be well to recall
the remarkable unseen events taking place within this lecture theater
of the Royal Institution, so pregnant with famous memories. You
probably did not notice that, as the lecturer entered, a large number
of an essential part of this gathering went out as quickly as he came
in. This number may be estimated at about a million million million
million, a number almost sufficient to impress even Sir James Jeans.
The calculation is not difficult, for my weight somewhat exceeds that
of 2 cubic feet of water. The late Sir Arthur Shipley pointed out
that all men, including even the Archbishop of Canterbury, are about
90 percent water, and it is clear that my volume is, more or less as
the lawyers say, 2 cubic feet or 5,000 cubic centimeters; but the num-
ber of air molecules in a cubic centimeter down here is roughly 2.7 by
102°, a vast number equivalent to 27 followed by 18 noughts. Multi-
plying these figures together, you obtain more than the million million
million million, or 1024, molecules that left the room as each one of
you came into the hall. The molecules of air are not at rest but are
moving more rapidly than a rifle bullet. They are frequently collid-
ing with one another, each one about 5,000 million times a second,
and providing everywhere, by their bombardment, a pressure of 15
pounds to the square inch. If the air in this room, about half a ton
of it, could be suddenly removed, my voice could not reach the audi-
ence, who would all be dead within 2 minutes, if they had not already
exploded outward from their internal pressure of 15 pounds to the
square inch. The air molecules are small; about 100 million of them,
side by side, would stretch for half an inch or so, but they are by no
means crowded, for their average distance apart is 300 times their

diameter. If my audience were similarly dispersed, and if you take
your diameter as one foot, then your nearest neighbor would be 100
yards away, so that the audience would be widely scattered and in
an extreme state of agitation. The sound waves of the speaker ara
faithfully transferred to your ears by this wild jumble of swift
molecules. There is the further demand of intelligence, the supreme
factor in physics, on the part of the audience and the lecturer! In
ithe meantime there are not only a gravitational field and a magnetic
field throughout the region, but all the electromagnetic waves, radio
or wireless waves, from nearly all the broadcasting stations of the
world, are coming through the walls and through our bodies almost as
if we did not exist, making the electrons in our conducting bodies
dance rhythmically up and down, so that each one of us is an aerial,
but most fortunately, I think, we are not gifted with receiving gear
to detect this medley. We have to content ourselves with that wonder-
ful octave of electromagnetic waves which gives us the glory of light
and the splendor of color.

Do not forget that from the cosmos there come also radiations
which can penetrate the whole atmosphere (equivalent to 30 inches of
mercury), pass through the roof, through our bodies, very many a
second, and plunge down into the earth. As was shown recently in
the underground railway at Holborn, even after passing through
more than 70 feet of solid ground, there still remains 15 percent of
the cosmic rays. On the whole, this theater is a much more lively
spot than a casual glance would suggest.

The upper atmosphere consists of air molecules similar to those
around us, but, at the reduced pressure of high altitudes, the mole-
cules are much further apart, their free paths are much longer, so
that collisions between the molecules are less frequent. The differ-
ence between the two elevations cannot be better illustrated than by
the passage of electricity between two conducting regions. At our
level there is a more or less noisy spark, or « flash of lightning with
a peal of thunder. ‘Although it is not possible to go many miles
aloft, it is possible to send a current of electricity between two metal
electrodes and to observe the changes that take place as the air is
pumped from a closed tube of considerable length. On making the
experiment there is at first little or no current; the air acts almost as
an insulator. On reducing the pressure there is a thin rosy line of
light which grows and fills the tube until a considerable current is
carried by charged molecules, or ions. It is unnecessary to recall at
the present moment all the successive changes, but it will be seen that
with a high vacuum a greenish light suffuses the whole tube, because
electrons are taking a large share in the proceedings, and you will
note that they may be deflected by a magnet.
NORTHERN LIGHTS—EVE 147

This experiment is better shown by projecting the electrons through
a small hole so that they glance along a fluorescent screen. It is then
easily seen that the beam of electrons is readily bent into a circular
arc on the approach of a magnet.

Two streams of electrons, passing through neighboring holes, may
be seen to repel one another, whereas parallel currents in the same
directions, passing along wires, are known to attract. All these
preliminary remarks have a direct bearing on the main theme—

Northern Lights.
THE UPPER AIR

Dwellers in cities see little of the night sky; they are dazzled by
street lights and advertising signs. Those who live in the country
enjoy a greater privilege. Although London is nearer to the North
Pole than Montreal or Quebec, yet it is the people of Canada who more
frequently see the glory of the Northern Lights. It is the distance
from the magnetic axis of the earth that counts, and that axis meets
the earth about midway between the north magnetic pole and the
North Pole. This might be called the north axial pole, and it is near
northwestern Greenland.

The appearance of the Northern Lights has been frequently de-
scribed, and in any case words are quite inadequate to describe its
beauty. We must look forward to the time when really good colored
motion pictures of the aurora have been taken, and this will be a diffi-
cult feat because the light intensity is feeble compared with sunlight.
The three main forms of display are the arc or arch, the curtains, and
the long streamers. The color is commonly greenish white or greenish
yellow, sometimes with an admixture of red or violet. I still remember
being taken as a small boy from bed at my home in the Midlands to
see from a window the rosy glow of the Northern Lights. It was the
winter of 1870-71 when the Prussians were besieging Paris, and the
villagers declared that the light was the reflection of Paris on fire,
regardless of the fact that Paris was to the south and the lights to the
north.

The first appearance of the aurora is sometimes a bright quiescent
arch with its peak a few degrees west of due north. This may sud-
denly be followed with a host of streamers, like searchlights, but
changing, flickering, and dancing. This is rather frivolous behavior,
for the Eskimo believe that the lights are the spirits of their ancestors.
At other times the display begins with nearly vertical curtains of
light, the folds of which keep changing in form. It is often a fascinat-
ing and resplendent spectacle, and it is pardonable if a word picture
falls short of the reality. The drapery is usually to the north, spread-
ing from east to west, but sometimes it appears quite overhead. Even

112059—37——11
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

as far south as the State of New York the curtain may sometimes be
seen south of the zenith.

The altitudes of these displays have been skillfully measured in
Norway by St¢rmer, with a number of observers connected by tele-
phone, who took photographs at the same instant from different
places at a measured number of miles apart (fig. 1). The photo-
graphs (pl. 1) show the Northern Lights in each case with a back-
ground of the stars of the Great Bear, but owing to parallax the
lights are seen in different positions relative to the stars on the

phone. From Oslo to Kongsberg is 63 kilometers.

different photographs. <A simple calculation determines the altitude
of the aurora. About 60 miles is the most common result, that is,
60 miles from the surface of the earth, not from the observer.
Sometimes the tops of the streamers may be 250 miles above the
earth, and I believe that the lowest determination is an altitude of
40 miles. The record height for the top of a streamer is 1,000 kilo-
meters, more than 600 miles. Similar measurements were made in
Canada by Sir John McLennan and others, and the results there
were in excellent agreement with the earlier determinations in
Norway.

It is a strange fact, proved by Stgrmer, that those auroras which
have the greatest altitudes, ranging (base to top) from 350 miles to
630 miles, occur in a sunlit portion of the atmosphere far above the

NORTHERN LIGHTS—EVE 149

dark region where the observer stands.2. Those auroras which occur
wholly in a dark atmosphere range from 60 miles to 200 miles.
Thus the upper ionized atmosphere appears to expand by day and
shrink at night. Appleton has found similar results when measuring
the altitudes of those ionized reflecting regions which echo back wire-
less waves of suitable wave length.

Notwithstanding these definite facts, and the further one that
Northern Lights appear behind distant mountains, there are many
who declare that they have seen an aurora close to the ground. An
engineer, with excellent judgment and good observational powers,
assured me that he had once seen personally some of his men walk
into an aurora! A minister in Canada wrote to me that he was
driving a horse and buggy when a brilliant display of aurora ap-
peared near the ground close to his side. He declared that his horse
saw it too, for the animal first shied and then bolted. It is no good
telling these men that they could see no such thing. <A probable but
not certain explanation is that a patch of mist close to the ground was
lit up by the vivid light of an aurora about 60 miles away.’

THE SOUND OF AURORAS

Several observers, some of whom I have met personally, declare
that sometimes there occurs with an auroral display a sound, dis-
tinctly audible, that resembles the swish of a silk dress, or the noise of
a sword moved swiftly with the blade broadside to the air, or of wind
whistling in the rigging of a ship. A westerner declared that he was
prepared to take an oath (that he could hear the Northern Lights)
on a stack of Bibles as high as a church. This picturesque evidence
proves nothing, except that the man quite meant what he said.
Here is a letter, exactly as written, sent to me by a trapper in the
Province of Quebec. Such men live much in the open both by day
and by night, and they see much of nature:

Il a été donne ici une conference par un de vos professeurs dont je ne puis

150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

The following letter was written to me by a McGill engineering
student who was fortunate enough to belong to an Arctic expedition
which, after so many years of search by so many navigators, did
actually discover the North-West Passage:

WEsTMOUNT, February 27, 1931.
Drak Sir:

Yesterday evening you were kind enough to request me to write concerning
the aurora.

I was fortunate enough to be a member of a Survey Expedition to find the
channel through the North-West Passage.

I wintered in the Arctic at the magnetic pole, 70 N., 96 W., during 1928-29.
During the period of darkness there were intense displays of aurora, most
frequently seen from the SW. to SE. in dead calm weather, temperature 50° F.
below zero. In the Arctic silence, it can be definitely said that whistling
crackling sounds accompanied the aurora display. They were also seen several
times in the NE. Their effect on radio communication was also marked. Most
frequently, north and south communication predominated, and only seldom
did the east and west predominate. The communication never showed freak
reception in all directions at once, but faded on one and increased on the
other.

It was difficult to get consistent data of the effects of aurora on radio com-
munication, even though I tested and communicated daily. The same observa-
tions were noted from King William Island during 1929-30.

(Signed) H. Ross SmyruH.

On the other hand, several of my scientific friends, such as Frank
Davies, who has been on both Arctic and Antarctic expeditions, have
listened in vain for sounds accompanying auroras. Negative evi-
dence, however, is never satisfactory. Others declare that the noise
swells and fades at the same instants that the lights increase and
diminish in intensity. It is difficult to believe that this could be true.
If the aurora is 60 miles away the sound therefrom, if any, would take
at 5 seconds for each mile, about 5 minutes to arrive, so that coinci-
dence would be more impossible than between lightning and thunder
with a flash many miles away.

Moreover, it must be remembered that sound does not emerge or
travel at all well in highly rarefied air such as there is in auroral
regions. There is the famous experiment, first made successfully by
Robert Boyle, after others had failed, which proved that the sound
of a bell does not emerge from within a receiver from which the air
is thoroughly pumped. What then do these men hear? It has even
been suggested that they hear the blood surging in their head, or the
tinkling of the ice of their frozen breath. We may safely dismiss
these suggestions as trivial. It seems more probable that they hear
something real in the same sense, let us say, that we hear church
bells ring. I may venture to suggest that in dry, cold weather there
may be a small brush discharge from snow or bushes somewhat sim-
ilar to St. Elmo’s Fire, seen on mountains, and sometimes as an

NORTHERN LIGHTS—EVE 151

electric discharge from the masts and rigging of a ship when the
earth’s voltage differs considerably from that of the air. My verdict
for what it is worth, is then, that men cannot possibly hear the
Northern Lights, which can make little or no noise, but they may
hear something else not far from them, such as a local brush
discharge.

SPECTROSCOPIC EVIDENCE

The spectrum of the aurora has been photographed, and most of
the lines, or bands rather, are found to be due to nitrogen, which is
the major constituent of the atmosphere (about four-fifths) here on
earth, and remains the chief constituent at high elevations. The
spectrum of the aurora also includes the famous green line which Sir
John McLennan investigated so ably, and proved to be due to oxygen
in an enhanced or unusual, excited state. He and his coworkers
actually produced the green line in his laboratory at Toronto by suit-
able stimulation of oxygen with helium, neon, or argon also present.
About 1 percent of the air at ground level is argon. All the other
rare gases are present in much minuter quantities—neon, krypton,
xenon, radon. Hydrogen is so light, and the molecular velocity in
consequence so large, that the hydrogen overcomes gravity and passes
out of the atmosphere.

Some of these gases, notably neon, the ingenious Claude has shown
us how to collect, to place in tubes at low pressure, and to ionize
with high voltage, so that every city is besplangled with artificial
auroras, and decorated with an extraordinary variety of colored signs
and vivid advertisements. The question is whether we most admire
their scientific interest, their intrinsic beauty, or the subtle skill with
which they invite or induce the public to buy. It was supposed that
some of the rare gases played a part in the rich coloring of auroras,
and McLennan suggested that at high altitudes there is more helium
than oxygen. On the other hand, experiments by Kaplan indicate
that enhanced nitrogen can also stimulate oxygen to emit the light of
the green line. Furthermore, the extended researches of Vegard
show that the spectra of auroras contain lines or bands of nitrogen
and oxygen only. No traces of hydrogen or helium were found.

THE AURORA AND MAGNETISM

Everyone today is familiar with a magnetic field, particularly as
everyone has lived all his life in a feeble field of that character due to
our great magnet the earth. It is not suggested that we know exactly
what magnetism is, but then that is true of everything else. The
magnetic compass needle, in some form or other, can reveal to us
both the direction and intensity of this field at any desired point.
Most people also know something of the behavior and properties of
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

electrons, and perhaps it is fair to add that the younger they are,
within reason, the more they know about them. The older among
us are conscious that this omniscience of the younger is not wholly
confined to electrons. However that may be, it is certain that if you
shoot electrons at right angles to a uniform magnetic field, the elec-
trons will go round in circles—exact circles. The stronger the field
and the slower the electrons, the smaller will be the circles, and the
converse is true. The mathematical, electrical, and mechanical prin-
ciples are simple and certain. People are beginning to believe that
physics is becoming indefinite and hazy, because they attend to the
fascinating borderlands of speculative science and are forgetful of
the definite and eternal verities. If, on the other hand, electrons are
projected obliquely to a magnetic field then the electrons will each one
describe a helix or a path with the shape of a corkscrew.

If electrons are shot earthward from the sun, they will travel
through space and become entrapped by the magnetic field of the
earth. They will spiral round the lines of force until they meet the
upper atmosphere in the regions surrounding either the north or
south magnetic poles. The speed of such electrons may be sufficient
by their collisions toe ionize the molecules, that is, to knock other
electrons from them, thus leaving positively charged molecules, or
ions. The recombination of electrons with positive ions is attended
with radiation, as has been amply proved in laboratory experiments.
It is generally believed that electrons spiraling round in one direc-
tion arrive near the north magnetic pole and give rise by ionization
to the aurora borealis; while similar electrons spiraling round the
lines of magnetic force in the other sense proceed toward the south
magnetic pole and occasion the aurora australis. This result is well
confirmed by experiment. In spite of some effort, I have not yet been
able to discover whether major displays of northern and southern
lights occur together at the same time in both Arctic and Antarctic
regions. There are some theoretical reasons for expecting such coin-
cidence, and some of the major displays, such as that of February 4,
1872, have been seen in both northern and southern latitudes.

There are some authorities who declare that light charged par-
ticles such as electrons would mutually repel one another on their
long journey from the sun, so that they would be scattered far afield
and in that case there should be no auroras at all! Prof. S. Chap-
man states that there are positive, negative, and neutral particles all
coming from the sun. There is a very wide choice of possible pro-
jectiles—electrons, positrons, protons, neutrons, deutons, alpha par-
ticles, and cosmic rays, besides photons. Therefore it is not wise to
be too dogmatic as to the nature of the bombardment that arrives at
the earth’s surface, but it is right to insist that only electrically

NORTHERN LIGHTS—EVE 153

charged particles will show so marked a tendency to proceed toward
the two main magnetic poles of the earth.

It may very well be asked why it is claimed that the projectiles come
from the sun. The answer is that auroras, sunspots, and magnetic
storms all follow, over a long series of years, the same periodic vari-
ation of increase and decrease in number and intensity. This is the
well-known 11-year cycle. In recent years the variation of the effec-
tive frequency required for radio signals across the Atlantic has been
found to follow the same cycle. The general result is that we have
a twofold aspect of the sun. On the one hand, it must be regarded
as a variable star with an 11-year period. On the other hand, it is
endowed with such marvelous constancy that the main temperature
of the earth has continued between the freezing and boiling point of
water ever since life first appeared upon the earth many hundreds
of millions of years ago, with every prospect of its long continuance.
The sun converts some of its mass into radiation at the rate of 3 or
4 million tons a second, and yet plenty remains. This delicate balance
of temperature must be an unusual feat, and is a thing which, if it
had not happened, would be deemed impossible. In my young days
Sir George Stokes would have said, “Design!” Today many say,
“Chance!” Looking on the matter as fairly as I can, and not attach-
ing too much weight to my enormous veneration of Stokes, it still
seems to me that he was probably correct. This is a difficult question
which everyone must decide for himself, unless he prefers to sit on
the fence.

AURORA AND THE WEATHER

There is a popular belief that a change of weather follows the
Northern Lights—a change for the worse. There are many beliefs
also connecting the moon and the weather; for if the moon is linked
with the tides, why not with the weather? A glance at a large scale
map will show that many various types of weather, good, bad, and
indifferent occur at any and the same time, at different places on the
whole face of the earth, whereas the phase of the moon is the same
for all. A somewhat similar statement may be made about an auroral
display, which often covers a large region and has to be responsible
for varied conditions. Besides, the aurora is 50 to 60 miles high, and
our weather is brewed in the lowest 10 miles, for the very highest
cirrus clouds are rarely higher than 6 miles. There is, however, this
point to be remembered: Northern Lights are not seen in cloudy
weather, but only in clear. Hence it is much more probable that rain
or cloud will follow the aurora than the reverse, but it is probably
erroneous to state that the change was caused by the aurora.

return to earth, there are records of elevation, temperature, and
humidity. Such balloons may also be followed with a transit instru-
ment, or theodolite, so that the wind velocity at different levels may
be deduced. The greatest elevation attained by a balloon without
NORTHERN LIGHTS—EVE 155

recorders, was 2314 miles, at Padua. One of Regener’s balloons has
ascended 1714 miles and been recovered with its recorders.

In recent years attempts have been made to explore the strato-
sphere in balloons. The intrepid Piccard constructed a gondola
sufficiently strong not to explode outward, and was himself carried
inside it upward by a balloon. The ascent is easy, the place and
nature of arrival on the earth are largely fortuitous. He reached an
altitude of 10 miles and obtained valuable results on the cosmic rays,
which at that height are about 100 times as intense as on the earth’s
surface. The Soviet gondola crashed to disaster after attaining an
altitude of 12 miles. The greatest height so far attained is 1314
miles, achieved last year by Anderson and Stevens in the United
States.

A new method of exploration has recently been devised by Tuve
and others, members of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism,
Carnegie Institution of Washington. A searchlight beam is directed
upward to a height of 17 to 40 miles, and the intensity of the hght
is modulated, or varied periodically at the source. A large concave
mirror collects the scattered hght from the upper part of the beam
and brings it to a focus on a photocell connected to an amplifier,
which is synchronized with the modulation of the searchlight. This
apparatus may well give some information on the nature of the
molecules in those very regions on which we are least informed,
above the range of pilot balloons and below the auroral and ozone
layers,

Ozone, O;, is produced from oxygen, O., by radiations of a suit-
able frequency or by electrical discharges. Much of the ultraviolet
light from the sun is absorbed or stopped in the ozonosphere about
20 to 40 miles above the earth. The presence of the ozone is revealed
by absorption bands in the spectrum of the sun. When the sun is
high it passes almost vertically through the ozone layers. When
the sun is setting its rays have to pass horizontally through a much
greater thickness. Measurements of the intensities of the absorp-
tion lines due to ozone lead to an estimate of the height of the ozone
region as being about 25 miles, and therefore lower than the Northern
Lights.

The barometric disturbance due to the great Krakatoa volcanic
explosion traveled four times round the earth, and the actual noise
of it was heard 3,000 miles away. The sound of big guns or of heavy
explosions passes upward into the cool and rarefied air and is then
refracted or bent back again to the earth, so that sometimes, like
short-wave radio, it cannot be heard or detected at intermediate
distances. Newton stood in the gateway of Trinity College, Cam-
bridge, and heard the guns of the naval action between the Dutch
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

and the English. He foretold a British victory, because the noise
of battle became gradually fainter as the victors pursued the Dutch.
The fact that sounds are bent back again to the earth necessitates
a warmer layer above the cold. It seems that with increasing altitude
the temperature may gradually decrease down to many degrees below
zero Fahrenheit, but at a height of 30 miles there is an increase up
to 80° F., and the heat to maintain this may be connected with the
formation of ozone from oxygen by the sun’s ultraviolet light.

RADIO WAVES

The most important method of throwing lght on the nature of
the upper regions of the air is by projecting radio (or wireless)
waves directly upward, for it is found that with suitable frequencies
they will be reflected back to the earth. It will be recalled how
puzzling it was, in the early days of wireless, to account for the fact
that the electromagnetic waves, expected to move in a straight line
like light, could travel from Ireland to Newfoundland. Today wire-
less waves, carrying speech, music, or Morse, can be sent completely
round the world, so that a man can speak to himself and hear it a
fraction of a second later, using waves which have circumnavigated
the globe, changing local time in the most remarkable way as they
traveled. During a part of the journey it must have been yesterday,
or tomorrow though on return it was the same day and perhaps
about a seventh of a second since they started. It was surmised both
by Kennelly and by Heaviside, independently, that the possibility of
successful long-range wireless signals depended upon reflection or re-
fraction by an electrified or ionized region at a considerable height
above the earth. ‘The proof of the existence of such a conducting
region was given by Appleton, who also showed that there is another
higher region also capable of reflecting radio waves back to the
earth.

The lower or # region is at about 100 kilometers, or 60 miles from
the earth, and it is also called the Kennelly-Heaviside region. The
upper or F region is two or three times as high, and bears the name
of Appleton. It is possible to send a brief signal of suitable fre-
quency which will be reflected back from both the / and F regions,
so that both signals may be recorded on a suitable photographic plate
(pl. 2) by means of a cathode ray oscillograph. It is possible to
measure the very short period of time between the initial and return
signals, and, as the velocity of such waves is about 186,000 miles a
second, it is easy to deduce the height of the reflecting region. For
example, if the interval is one-thousandth of a second, the reflecting
layer would be about 93 miles above the earth. Experiments carried
out by Henderson and others, during a total eclipse of the sun in
NORTHERN LIGHTS—EVE 157

Canada, proved that the / region is made conducting, or is ionized
by the ultraviolet light from the sun, but it is not yet possible to
assign a cause to the / region.

It should be clear now that it is necessary to determine in due course
the different types of radiation responsible for (a) the ozone layer,
(6) the Kennelly-Heaviside layer, (c) the Appleton layer, (d) the
more occasional and local auroral displays, all of which are attribut-
able to the sun’s activity. There is a yet more difficult problem with
respect to the cosmic rays and the bursts or showers of ions to which
they give rise. Sometimes a hundred million ions occur at a single
outburst.

In the upper atmosphere the pressure is so low that the molecules
are quite far apart, and if an electron is detached from a molecule by
some type of radiation, it may have to wander a long way before it
can find a partner in a positive ion; or it may find a resting place on
a neutral molecule, so that the pair become a negative ion. While
free, the electrons are so small and hight compared with their electric
charge that they are readily made to oscillate, or dance in rhythm,
with any electromagnetic waves that are passing them. Curiously
enough, the group of waves travels the faster in consequence, so that
an electromagnetic wave entering these ionized regions obliquely
has the upper part wheeling faster than the lower, until the wave
front is turned round and proceeds downward to the earth again.
However, much the same sort of thing happens every time you look
into an ordinary mirror or looking glass. There also the free elec-
trons in the mercury at the back of the glass are able by their stimu-
lated motion to return to you a fairly faithful image of your face.

Radio signals will also bounce to and fro between the earth and tha
reflecting regions, proving that the earth also is an admirable radio
reflector. The total path for eight such reflections, which have been
obtained from the F region, must exceed 2,000 miles.

SUNSPOTS

In the old days the heavens were deemed to be eternal, changeless,
and perfect, so that the discovery in the days of Galileo that there
were spots on the sun came as a shock to medieval thought. The face
of the sun is a turbulent place at the high temperature of 6,000° C.
Black spots appear on it, sometimes large enough to be seen through
a darkened glass with the unaided eye, and much broader than the
diameter of the earth. The number of these spots follows the same
11-year cycle as the frequency of the aurora. At the beginning of
such a period the face of the sun may be practically without spots
(pl. 3). In due course a few appear in middle latitudes on both sides
of the sun’s equator. There is a steady increase in number, the spots

NORTHERN LIGHTS—EVE 159

become nearer to the equator, and they disappear when at the lowest
attained latitudes.

These relatively cool, dark whirlpools reveal magnetic properties
discovered by Hale through the Zeeman effect, and they may perhaps
be compared with the “lows” or cyclones which so often bring storm,
rain, and flood. The periodicity of sunspots, auroras, magnetic storms
on the earth, and changing radio phenomena has been found to hold
good for the fluctuations of the white polar caps on the planet Mars
and even for a cycle of ring growths in the great and ancient trees
of western America,

METEORS

Most people are familiar with shooting stars or meteors and many
have seen in their lives dozens or hundreds of them; yet it always
comes as a surprise to learn that no less than 20 million of them
every day plunge into our atmosphere with velocities ranging up to
130 miles a second. Sometimes these visitors are but the size of a
pin’s head, and at other times they are large enough to pierce the
atmosphere and reach the earth. The famous Arizona crater may
have been formed long ago by a giant meteor; the crater is 1,400
yards wide and more than 500 feet deep. In 1908, a great meteor,
estimated to weigh 130 tons, fell in Siberia and devastated by its
great heat hundreds of square miles of country. The elevation of
most frequent meteoric displays is about 40-60 miles above the earth.
It is somewhere in this region that the temperature rises according
to the theory of the reflection of sound waves, to which already
reference has been made. Sometimes the meteors are of iron, some-
times of stone, and it is not easy to understand how they become
red or white hot when rushing through cool air, how indeed they
acquire more heat from the bombardment of molecules than is
carried away by them. However, the luminosity of meteors occurs in
rarefied air at heights of 100 to 30 miles above the earth. An experi-
ment in the laboratory of a similar character would be difficult to
make, because our projectiles achieve a speed of a few thousand feet
a second as contrasted with meteors having velocities of many miles
a second.

MOTHER-OF-PEARL AND NOCTILUCENT CLOUDS

There occur rarely and at great elevations iridescent clouds, as
remarkable for their beauty as for their height. They are generally
observed over regions of low barometric pressure and it is probable
that the clouds are formed of supercooled water vapor.* Stérmer
and his coworkers have measured the altitudes of many of these

*S. Chapman, Nature, vol. 129, p. 497, Apr. 2, 1932.
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

“mother-of-pearl” clouds (pl. 4) and found them to be in the strato-
sphere, about 15 miles above the ground.

The strangest of clouds (pl. 5) are those observed in the middle
of the night, or twilight, which occur at a measured altitude of 50
miles. The heights have been measured in Norway® by the same
band of observers and at many of the same stations as those used in
the determinations of the distance of auroras from the earth’s sur-
face. These clouds are not iridescent, and they move westward at
about 100 miles an hour.

It will be gathered that the study of the Northern Lights is bound
up with other physical phenomena in the upper regions of our
atmosphere, and that progress can best be made, as in other branches
of science, by advance on a broad front.

RADIOACTIVITY AND ATOMIC THEORY *

By Lorp RuTHERFORD, O. M., F. R. S.

Nearly 40 years have passed since the spontaneous radioactivity of
uranium was shown by Becquerel in 1896. We know that the investi-
gations which led to this fundamental discovery were much influenced
by the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in the preceding year. We
can now look back with some sense of perspective and recognize the
extraordinary importance of the discovery of radioactivity and the
profound influence on our knowledge of atoms and the relation of
the elements which has followed from a detailed study of the
radioactive bodies.

In the course of this lecture, I have thought it of interest to give
a brief account of some of the earlier experiments in radicactivity
which pointed the way to the conclusion that the radioactive bodies
were undergoing spontaneous transformation. This will be followed
by a statement of the most significant of the discoveries that have
resulted from an examination of the chemical and radioactive prop-
erties of the radio-elements. But this in a sense is only the begin-
ning of the story. The use of swift a-particles to bombard matter
gave us the first proof that certain light elements could be trans-
formed by artificial methods. This has been followed in recent years
by experiments in which streams of other fast particles, like protons,
neutrons, and deuterons, have been artificially generated in order to
bombard matter. By these methods, we have been enabled to extend
widely our knowledge of the modes of transformation of the ele-
ments. In some cases, the nuclei of the atoms can be caused to break
up with explosive violence, giving rise to new stable elements. In
other cases, new radioactive bodies are produced which correspond
to unstable isotopes of the elements. More than 50 of these arti-
ficially produced radioactive bodies are now known, and no doubt
many more will be found in the near future.

The subject of radioactivity has indeed been born anew and has
entered again on a new and vigorous phase of life. It is of interest

161
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

to note that the methods developed long ago for the investigation
of the radioactive bodies proper are now every day being applied
to study the artificial transformation of elements and to follow the
chemical changes involved. I have personally followed with great
interest this ever-widening extension of the province of radioactivity,
which today embraces so many workers and has already given us a
new science in which the reactions occurring in the minute nucleus
of an atom can be studied. The opening up of this new territory
has only been made possible by the development of new and powerful
electric methods of producing intense streams of bombarding particles
with high speeds, and by the improvement of the automatic methods
of counting swift particles, and by the wide use of that wonderful
instrument, the Wilson expansion chamber, to obtain visual evidence
of the process of transformation.

Before discussing the changes in our ideas due to the study of
radioactive transformations, we may pause for a moment to consider
-the prevailing ideas on atoms and their structure just before the
discovery of radioactivity (1896) and the proof of the independent
existence of the electron (1897). The atomic theory of Dalton had
been almost universally accepted as the basis of the interpretation
of the facts of chemistry. The work of the chemist for nearly a
century had resolved our material world into 80 or more distinct
types of atoms or elements, and had shown that the atoms of the
elements were stable entities unchangeable by the chemical and
physical forces then at our disposal. With increase of knowledge,
the old ideas of the alchemists of the transmutation of the elements
had been discarded, although it was recognized that one of the main
problems of chemistry was to disclose the true relation of the elements
and if possible to devise more potent methods capable of changing
one element into another. This was well expressed by Faraday, “to
decompose the metals, then, to reform them, to change them from
one to another, and to realize the once absurd notion of transmuta-
tion, are the problems now given to the chemist for solution.” To
the philosophic mind, the periodic law of Mendeléef was of great
significance in indicating that the atoms of the elements were not
separate creations but closely related in their ultimate structure, but
there was at that time no clue to the underlying meaning of this
remarkable relation. It should be recalled that the periodic classifi-
cation had been successful in predicting the properties of missing
elements, and, indeed, the position of several elements discovered later,
after Moseley’s generalization, had been indicated correctly.

While the law of combining proportions did not involve any defi-
nite knowledge of the size and structure of atoms, yet the size and
weight of the individual atoms had been roughly estimated from
RADIOACTIVITY—RUTHERFORD 163

data based on the kinetic theory of gases. There was, however, little
definite information to form any idea of the structure of atoms,
although theoretical physicists like Larmor and Lorentz, in order to
account for the vibrating properties of the atom as shown by its line
spectrum, had suggested that the atom must consist of charged
particles, but there was no evidence of the nature of the particles
concerned. This difficulty, as we now know, was in part resolved
by the discovery of the electron and the interpretation of the Zee-
man effect. At this stage, although the relative atomic weights of
many of the elements had been accurately measured, the ideas of
atoms were very vague and uncertain. Although an enormous
amount of information on the combining properties of atoms had
been collected, and simple and useful working rules had been applied
in explanation, more definite ideas of the underlying meaning of
chemical combination had to await a much clearer conception of the
electronic structure of atoms.

EARLY EXPERIMENTS IN RADIOACTIVITY

My introduction to the subject of radioactivity began in a natural
way in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, in 1897 as the result
of earlier experiments on the ionization produced in gases by X-rays.
Becquerel had shown that the radiation from uranium caused the
discharge of an electroscope, but had concluded that the radiation
was different from X-rays in showing some evidences of refraction
and polarization. I proceeded to examine whether the ionization
was of the same type as that produced by X-rays and in the course
of the work found that the rays were of two types, one easily ab-
sorbed, called the a-rays, and a more penetrating type, named the
B-rays. A few observations were also made on the rays from
thorium, which Schmidt in 1898 had found to be radioactive. Soon
after my appointment to McGill University, Montreal, in 1898, Prof.
R. B. Owens and I began some experiments on the radiations from
thorium, using the electrical method. We found that the effects
produced by some thorium compounds, and particularly the oxide,
appeared to be very capricious and much influenced by slight
draughts of air in the testing vessel. Strong ionizing effects were
observed when thoria was covered with several sheets of paper, but
only weak effects when the preparation was completely covered over
by a thin sheet of mica. This peculiar inconsistency of the effects
from thorium was at first very puzzling, as under the same condi-
tions the radioactivity shown by uranium was quite constant.

In order to investigate the matter further, I arranged to pass a
current of air over the thoria down a long tube and to examine the
conductivity of the air in a large ionization chamber by means of

1120593712
164. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

an electrometer. I then found that, on stopping the current of air,
the ionization effect fell off according to a geometrical law with the
time, diminishing to half-value in about 1 minute. It thus seemed
clear that thoria emitted some kind of active substance which was
carried away with the air stream and decayed in activity with time.
I gave the name “emanation” to this unknown substance which
readily diffused through paper. This was the first time that the
characteristic law of decay of radioactive bodies had been measured.
At the same time, I noticed that all substances which came in con-
tact with the emanation for some time became radioactive. This
“excited” activity, as it was unfortunately termed, decayed with
time after the removal of the emanation, according to the same law
as the emanation but with a much longer half period, viz., 11 hours
instead of 1 minute. Another surprising result was observed in a
strong electric field. The activity was to a large extent concentrated
on the negative electrode. In this way, a platinum wire could be
made strongly active. The activity on the wire could be driven off
by heat and removed by solution in acids, but when the acid was
evaporated, the activity remained behind. These results were a
strong indication that the activity was due to some kind of matter
produced either from the emanation or by its action. It seemed
likely that the emanation existed in very minute quantity, but it
occurred to me that diffusion methods might throw light on whether
the emanation was a light or a heavy substance. For this purpose,
the relatively long-lived emanation from radium was employed. By
measuring the coefficient of diffusion of the emanation into air, Miss
H. T. Brooks and I concluded that its molecular weight was large
and of the order of 100.

About this time, 1901, began that fruitful association with F.
Soddy, who was then a teacher in the Chemical Department of
McGill University. At this stage, the subject of radioactivity was
in a very confused state. A number of substances had been found to
show a temporary activity when separated from a radioactive solu-
tion or exposed to radioactive bodies, and the idea had arisen that
the radiations had in some way the property of “inducing” radio-
_ activity on bodies exposed to the radiation. This was a natural but
mistaken idea which had to be cleared away before progress could
be made. For this purpose we first made experiments on the
thorium emanation to determine its chemical properties and to find
whether it originated from thorium itself or from some other sub-
stance associated with it. We found that a new radioactive sub-
stance, named thorium-X, could be chemically separated from
thorium and that this substance and not the thorium itself gave rise
to the emanation. It was found that thorium-X was being produced
RADIOACTIVITY—RUTHERFORD 165

at a constant rate in the thorium and was converted into emanation.
The constant activity due to thorium-X was shown to be the result
of an equilibrium process in which the decay of the active matter was
balanced by its continuous production. This process of production
and decay was found to be a universal property of the radioactive
bodies.

A study of the chemical properties showed that the emanation of
both thorium and radium must be chemically inert and correspond
to the group of gases of the helium-argon family. We now know
that the radioactive emanations are isotopic representatives of the
last of the inert gases. Finally, the material nature of the emana-
tions was definitely established by proving they could be condensed
in a spiral surrounded by liquid air. It is a noteworthy example of
the delicacy and certainty of the methods of detection of radioactive
matter that the chemical nature of the emanations and their condensa-
tion at low temperatures could be definitely established with almost
infinitesimal amounts of active matter, far too small to be seen or
weighed or detected by the spectroscope.

The experiments with thorium-X and the emanation gave us for
the first time a clear idea of radioactive processes and led us to
put forward in 1902-03 the transformation theory of radioactive
elements. Although the results were substantiated and extended by
investigations with other radioactive substances, time does not allow
me to refer to them, and I must pass on at once to consider the
importance of these new ideas on transformation.

THE TRANSFORMATION OF RADIO-ELEMENTS

The proofs that radioactivity was a sign and measure of the insta-
bility of atoms and that the radio-elements were undergoing spon-
taneous transmutation were contributions to our knowledge of out-
standing importance. The long series of radioactive changes in
uranium, thorium, and actinium were with few exceptions made clear
during the next few years. There were thus brought to light more
than 30 radio-elements, each of which showed distinctive radio-
active behavior and broke up according to a simple and definite law.
In most cases, in the process of transformation, the radio-element
emitted either a swift «-particle, now known to be a charged atom
of helium, or a fast 8-particle (negative electron). The transforma-
tion process is distinguished from an ordinary chemical reaction, not
only because the disintegration appears to be spontaneous and unalter-
able by the forces at our command, but, most important of all, by the
enormous amount of energy emitted from each exploding atom. This
energy is for the most part emitted in the kinetic form of a swift
a- or B-particle, but in some cases a part of the energy is emitted in
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

the form of electromagnetic radiation of high frequency (y-rays).
Since there was a large emission of energy in the change of one atom
into another, it was natural to infer that a large store of energy was
contained in a heavy atom. It was clear, too, that the atom must be
the seat of intense internal forces in order to be able to hurl out a
fragment of itself with such high speed.

Since experiments are usually made with small quantities of active
matter or with elements like radium of slow rate of transformation,
it is not easy to realize except in imagination the extraordinary effects
that would be observed if we could, for example, experiment with a
reasonable quantity of a short-lived element like the gas radon. Sup-
pose we were able to obtain a kilogram of this gas and introduce it
into a bomb made of heat-resisting material. At the end of about 2
hours heat would be evolved corresponding to about 20,000 kilowatts,
and the bomb would be melted unless it were very efficiently cooled.
Penetrating y-rays would be emitted with energy corresponding to
about 1,000 kilowatts. The heating effect would die away with the
decay of radon (half period 3.8 days). At the end of about 2 months
the radon would mostly have disappeared, but in its place would
remain about 54 grams of the gas helium, and deposited on the walls
946 grams of a lead isotope (radium-D), atomic weight 210), mixed
with a small quantity of radium-/ and polonium. After allowing
about 200 years for most of the radium-D to disappear, we should
then find remaining about 72 grams of helium and 928 grams of an
inactive lead isotope of atomic weight 206. I cannot imagine a more
convincing experiment to illustrate the striking nature of these radio-
active transformations, but unfortunately, or rather fortunately hav-
ing regard to the safety of the investigator from the radiations, there
is little chance of trying such a large-scale experiment.

The property of radioactivity, apart from uranium and thorium
and their products, is shown only by a few other elements, potassium
and rubidium—to which may now be added samarium—and then
only to a very feeble degree. All the rest of the chemical elements
appear to be permanently stable when tested by the criterion of
radioactivity.

When once the nature of the «- and £-particles had been established
and the long series of radioactive changes in uranium, thorium, and
actinium had been mostly made clear, it appeared that the main con-
tribution of radioactivity to our knowledge was nearing an end. But
it is characteristic of this subject that no sooner does it appear to be
visibly moribund than it flashes out again into vigorous life, leading
to new and unexpected additions to our knowledge. This is well illus-
trated by the work of the next few years, 1911-13, which saw three
new advances of great significance for the future—I refer to the idea
RADIOACTIVITY—RUTHERFORD 167

of the nuclear structure of atoms, the conception of the isotopic con-
stitution of the elements, and the proof of an extraordinarily simple
relation between the chemical properties of the radio-elements known
under the name of the “displacement law.”

The discovery of the electron in 1897 and the proof that it was a
constituent of all atoms gave a great impetus to the belief that atoms
were electrical structures. In 1904 Sir J. J. Thomson had proposed his
well-known model atom and devised methods for estimating the num-
ber of electrons contained in each atom. On account of its mass and
great energy of motion, the «-particle offered great advantages as a
projectile to investigate the inner structure of atoms. It was known
that it traveled through matter in nearly a straight line and must pene-
trate freely the structure of the atoms in its path. In addition, the
scintillation method provided a delicate means of counting individual
a-particles. The proof that the a-particle occasionally suffered a de-
flection through a large angle as the result of a single collision provided
clear evidence that enormous deflecting forces existed within the atom.
From these observations, I was led in 1911 to the idea that the atom
was a very open electronic structure containing at its center a very
minute charged nucleus in which most of the mass of the atom was con-
centrated. The properties of the atom were defined by an integer rep-
resenting the number of units of resultant charge carried by the nu-
cleus. The fine experiments of Geiger and Marsden gave convincing
evidence of the accuracy of the laws of scattering of «-particles calcu-
lated on this hypothesis and also gave us approximate estimates of the
nuclear charge of the elements. As you know, this conception that the
properties of the atom are defined by an integral number was verified
and extended by the splendid experiments of Moseley on the X-ray
spectra of the elements. He showed that the properties of an atom
depended on its ordinal number, and identified this with the nuclear
charge—a result later substantiated by Chadwick by direct determi-
nation of the nuclear charge by scattering experiments. Moseley’s
work was of far-reaching importance, for it fixed once for all the
number of the elements between hydrogen and uranium and gave the
atomic number and X-ray spectra of the missing elements, several of
which have since been discovered.

The next two important discoveries were a direct consequence of a
very careful study of the chemical properties of the radio-elements.
Several observers had noted that it was impossible, chemically, to sepa-
rate certain radioactive elements when mixed together; for example,
thorium and ionium, radium-D and lead, radium and mesothorium,
although these elements showed quite distinctive radioactive proper-
ties and were believed to be of different atomic weights. Soddy con-
cluded that these elements of identical chemical properties must occupy
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1936

the same place in the periodic table, and gave them the name of “‘iso-
topes.” This was the first time that proof had been obtained that an
element might be complex and consist of atoms differing in mass and
structure. The complexity of the radio-elements is now well estab-
lished. The three well-known radioactive series contain, for example,
six isotopes of thorium, three of radium, seven of lead, and seven of
polonium, and each of these isotopes shows a different mass and dis-
tinctive radioactive behavior.

The next notable advance was the proof that the position of a radio-
element in the periodic table had a very simple connection with the
type of radiation emitted by the parent product. Soddy had early
noted several cases in which the emission of an «-particle, which car-
ries two units of positive charge, gave rise to a product which had the
chemical properties of an element two places preceding its parent in
the periodic table. We now know that the effect of an emission of a
B-particle, which carries only one unit of negative charge, is a corre-
sponding displacement of one group in the opposite direction. The
more complete generalization had to await a more definite knowledge
of the chemical nature of some of the products, much of which was
supplied by the careful work of Fleck. The essential features of this
process, known as the displacement law, were put forward about the
same time in 19138 by Fajans, by A. S. Russell, and by Soddy, and not
only included within their scope nearly all the radioactive bodies in the
three main families, but even predicted the properties and positions of
elements hitherto unobserved. The proof of this relation indicated
that the periodic grouping of the elements was closely connected with
the loss or gain of charge of the atom due to the expulsion of an «- or
B-particle.

While the displacement law, as put forward, is quite independent of
any special theory of the atom, yet we see that it is in complete accord
with the nuclear theory if we suppose that the a- and the £-particle are
released from the nucleus. The atomic number and atomic weights of
uranium and thorium being known, the atomic number and weight of
each of the successive elements can be written down from a knowledge
of the radiations emitted by each element, illustrating the extraordi-
nary simplicity of the laws which hold for atomic nuclei.

The new conception of the isotopic constitution of the radio ele-
ments naturally had a great influence in promoting experiments to
decide whether the ordinary inactive elements also were complex.
Very largely owing to the pioneer work of Aston, the broad features
of the isotopic constitution of the great majority of the elements
were soon established, indicating that the varieties of stable atoms
were much more numerous than had been supposed.
RADIOACTIVITY—RUTHERFORD 169

ARTIFICIAL TRANSMUTATION

We now come to a discovery, the proof of the artificial transmu-
tation of the elements, which has led to a wide extension of the field
of radioactivity. A few words should first be said of the theo-
retical aspects of this problem as they appeared to be in 1918. On
the nuclear theory, an atom could only be changed by altering in
some way the charge or mass of the nucleus, or both together. It
was known that the nucleus was of exceedingly minute dimensions
with a radius of the order 10? cm and must be held together by
exceedingly powerful forces in order to prevent its spontaneous dis-
ruption. In order to transform an atom, it thus seemed clear that
a very concentrated source of energy must be brought to bear on the
individual nucleus. Actuated by these ideas, I began experiments
in 1917 to test whether the bombardment of light elements by ener-
getic a-particles might lead to the occasional transformation of a
nucleus as the consequence of a direct collisien between the nuclei
concerned. It could be calculated that in such an encounter the
a-particle must come very close to the nucleus, even if it did not
penetrate its structure. Such a close approach must in any case give
rise to enormous forces between the a-particle and the nucleus which
might be expected to produce such a distortion of its structure as to
result in the disintegration of the nucleus. The scintillation method
was employed to detect whether any fast particles appeared under
such an intense «-particle bombardment. No effect was noticed for
carbon or oxygen, but a number of fast particles were observed in
the case of nitrogen, which were identified as swift hydrogen nuclei,
now known as protons. It seemed clear that these protons could
only: arise as the result of the transformation of the nitrogen nucleus.
In the light of later results, the essential processes involved in this
transformation are now clear. Occasionally an «-particle actually
enters the nitrogen nucleus and forms a new atom like fluorine of
mass 18 and nuclear charge 9. This new nucleus is unstable and
instantly breaks up with explosive violence, hurling out a fast proton
and leaving behind a stable nucleus corresponding to a stable isotope
of oxygen of mass 17. On an average only one «-particle in 100,000
is effective in producing such a transformation.

With the help of Chadwick, it was soon found that 12 of the light
elements could be transformed in a similar way with the emission
in each case of protons, but with different speeds and numbers.
Time does not allow me to discuss later important developments
which have shown that groups of protons of different velocities
are ejected from each element and which have proved that reso-
nance levels exist within the struck nucleus favoring the capture of
a-particles of definite speed. Further investigation led to a dis-
170

covery by Chadwick in 1933 of great significance.

The element

beryllium when bombarded by «-particles does not emit protons but
a new type of particle of mass about 1 and zero charge called the

neutron.

This new particle has remarkable properties, since, ow-

ing to its absence of charge, it can pass freely through the structure

of atoms.

Occasionally, it collides elastically with a nucleus, which

is set in swift motion, but sometimes it enters a nucleus and is cap-

tured by it.
