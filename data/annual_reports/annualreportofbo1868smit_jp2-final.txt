PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION

OF THE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

.

[PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND
. ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 18, 1847. ]

INTRODUCTION.

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a Plan of
Organization.

1. WILL oF SmiTHson. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, ‘‘to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.”

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government of the
United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently sup-
posed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and perpet-
uate his name.

4, The objects of the Institution are, 1st, to increase, and, 2d, to diffuse
knowledge among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another. The
first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition of new
truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus increased, among
men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths; and can be most extensively
diffused among men by means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should be
such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of increas-
ing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either at all or
so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provision-
ally; can be easily reduced to practice; receive modifications, or be aban-
doned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of. time
occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution, a
considerable portion of the interest which has accrued should be added
to the principal. ;

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated, the
funds are small. Economy should, therefore, be consulted in the con-
struction of the building; and not only the first cost of the edifice should
8 ° PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in repair,
and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected with it.
There should also be but few individuals permanently supported by the
Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined by
the plan of the organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be bene-
fited by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure on
local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of the
act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a library, a
museum, and a gallery ef art, with a building on a liberal scale to con-
tain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offering
suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths; and,
2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular
researches, under the direction of suitable persons.

TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the dit-
ferent branches of knowledge; and,

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.

I. By stimulating researches.

1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all
branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of volumes,
in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.

3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for pub-
lication which does not furnish a positive addition to human knowledge,
resting on original research; and ail unverified speculations to be re-
jected.

4, Hach memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for
examination to a comission of persons of reputation for learning in the
’ branch to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for publica-
tion only in case the report of this commission is favorabie.

5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution, and
the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a favora-

le decision is made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions
of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to all the col-
leges and principal libraries in this country. One part of the remaining
copies may be otiered for sale, and the other carefully preserved, to form
compiete sets ef the work, to supply the demand -from new institutions.

>
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9

7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs
to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to
Congress.

Il. By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects of
research, under the direction of suitable persons.

fouls, Tihe objects and the amount appropriated, to be recommended by

counsellors of the Institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different objects; so that in
course of time each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these “appropriations to be published,
siti the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge.

4. Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving the
problem of American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological, mag-
netical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the formation
of a Physical Atlas of the United States.

(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determination
of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of light;
chemical analyses of soils a nd plants; collection and publication of scien:
tifie facts accumulated in the oftices ‘of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches, and accurate surveys of places celebrated in
American history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the differ-
ent races of men in North America; also, explorations and aceurate sur-
veys of the mounds and other remains ot the ancient people of our
country.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I. By the publication of a sertes of reports, giving an account of the new dis
coveries tr science, and of the changes made from year to year in ail
branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally interest-
ing, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the
reports may be published - annually, others at longer intervals, as the
income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of knowle dge
may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the dif-
ferent branches of knowledge.

3. Hach collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publica
tions, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his report;
to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on the title-
peer of the report.

The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons inter-
ated in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it without
purchasing the whole.
» These reports may be presented to Congress, for partial distribu-
tion, the remaining copies to be given to liter: wy and scientifie institu-
tions, and sold to indiv iduals for a moderate price.
10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in the
reports:

I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry, and
meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4, Application of science to arts.

II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,
antiquities, &c.

G. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.

8. A survey of the political events of the world; penal reform, &c.

III. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

. Modern literature.

10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.

12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.

ve)

Il. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs trans-
lated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the direction
of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the best exposi-
tion of a given subject.

2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission of
competent judges previous to their publication. :

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of the
present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in the
table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of the
Board of Regents providing for the two modes of increasing and diffusing
knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated the
formation of alibrary and a museum; and the Board of Regents, includ-
ing these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide the in-
come into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge
by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme before
given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation of a library
and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.

4, To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required,
consisting, 1st, of a complete collection of the transactions and proceed-
ings of all the learned societies in the world; 2d, of the more important
current periodical publications, and other works necessary in preparing
the periodical reports.
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 11

5. The Institution should make. special collections, particularly of
objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of ex-
perimental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those men-
tioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the United States
should be procured, in order that the valuable books first purchased may
pe such as are not to be found in the United States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of bibliograph-
ical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any work which
he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase by
donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make provision
for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary to pur-
chase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts
of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of expense,
for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other similar
societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of an-
tiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &ce.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, besides
the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except one, to act
as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to the

regents. He shall take charge of the building and property, keep a
record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and keeper of
the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents, employ assist-
ants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,
will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit
new objects of art. Distinguished individuals should also be invited to
give lectures on subjects of general interest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has become
the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change is that
expressed by the following resolutions, adopted January 15, 1855, VIZ:

ftesolved, That the 7th resolution passed by the Board of Regents, on
the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the income
between the active ‘operations and the museum and library, when the
buildings are completed, be, and it is hereby, repealed.

Resolved, That hereatter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution, in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents, be
necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic importance and
a compliance in good faith with the law.
REPORT

OF
PROFESSOR HENRY, SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
‘ FOR
1868.

To the Board of Regents :

GENTLEMEN: Nothing has occurred during the past year of a charac-
ter demanding the special action of the Board. Indeed, the policy of the
Institution originally adopted has become so firmly settled and so widely
known, as well as properly appreciated, that few difficulties are now
likely to present themselves in the administration of the trust which do
not find a solution in some precedent in the experience of the past. The
funds appropriated at the last session have been devoted to the different
objects for which they were designated, and the several classes of opera-
tions which were inaugurated at the commencement of the Institution
have been prosecuted with as much efficiency as the means at disposal
would permit. From the first there has been no want of unoccupied
fields inviting attention, and well adapted with judicious cultivation to
yield a plentiful harvest of additions to science. Indeed, the only sub-
ject of regret suggested by a review of the past, or a survey of the pres-
ent, is the application of so large a portion of the income to objects which,
though in most cases important in themselves, are not, as is now gener-
ally conceded, strictly reconcilable either with the scope or the terms of
the endowment. The guardians of the Institution are not, however,
responsible for these expenditures, which had their origin in a general mis-
conception of the import of the bequest at the time when Congress enacted
the law organizing the Institution. On the contrary, the administration
has been such as to correct, as far as possible, the errors above mentioned,
and to present to the world an example worthy of imitation in the manage-
ment of other establishments founded on trust funds. The directors have
ever been deeply impressed with a sense of the importance of the trust .
committed to their charge, not only in consideration of the good which
might directly result from it, but also on account of the influence which
so conspicuous, and in many respects so original an enterprise, could not
fail to have upon the world. Man is an imitative being, and among the
many individuals in this country who have aécumulated princely fortunes
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

by the energetic exercise of native talents, there are probably not a few
who only need the assurance of a successful precedent to induce them
to emulate the liberality of Sinithson in the endowment of other institu-
tions for the advancement of knowledge.

At the last session of the board it was resolved that a memorial should .
be presented to Congress, setting forth the large expenditure to which
the Institution had been subjected by reason of the accommodation and
maintenance of the National Museum, and asking that the usual appro-
priation of $4,000 which had been made on account of these objects
might be increased to $10,000; also that $25,000 might be appropri-
ated towards fitting up the large room in the second story of the
main building for the better exhibition of the government collections.
In accordance with this resolution the petition was prepared, signed by
the Chancellor and Secretary of the Institution, and presented to the
House of Representatives by General Garfield, one of the regents. It was
referred to the Committee on Appropriations, and although forcibly and
eloquently advocated by the members of the Board of Regents belonging
to the House, it was not granted, and only the usual appropriation of
$4,000 was made. The reasonableness of this petition, which I doubt

“not under a better condition of the national finances will meet with a
more favorable reception, must be manifest when it is considered that
$4,000 is the sum which the maintenance of the museum cost the gov-
ernment when it was under the charge of the Patent Office, and that
since its removal to the Institution it has been enlarged to threefold its
previous size, while the money has been depreciated to one-half its former
value; and furthermore, that the amount expended since the fire in
1865, for the reconstruction of the building and supply of furniture, is
over $140,000, the greater part of which was for the accommodation of the
National Museum. This large sum was rendered necessary by the pecu-
liar character of the architecture, the cost of fire-proof materials, and
the high price of labor. Of the above amount, more than $20,000 was
defrayed from the annual income of last year, and after this reduction
of the resources it was scarcely to be expected that the operations of
the Institution could be carried on with as much efficiency as had been
the casein years previous to the disaster which entailed on it this heavy
incidental expenditure. Yet we venture to hope that the exposition given
in the following parts of this report will show the results attained to
have been little inferior in value or extent to those of any preceding year.

It will appear from the report of the Executive Committee, that notwith-
standing the large draughts which have been made upon the funds on
account of the building, they are still in a highly prosperous condition.
Thus, while at the beginning of the year 1868 there was a balance in the
treasury of about $11,000, with outstanding liabilities contracted prin-
cipally for repairs and reconstruction to the amount of $22,000; on the
other hand, at the beginning of 1869, there is a disposable balance of
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

*»

$10,352, with bills falling due to the amount of not more than $3,000.
The funds are therefore in a better condition at present than they were
a year ago by upwards of $18,000. The Institution having paid all
indebtedness incurred by repairs on the building, could to-day wind up
its affairs not only without debt, but with the capital exhibited in the
following statement:

The whole bequest of Smithson, in United States treasury.. $541,379 63

Additions from savings, &c., in United States treasury... 103,620 37

While every part of the original programme has been rigidly carried
out, the large increase in the capital exhibited in the foregoing state-
ment may justly be claimed as the result of frugal management and
a judicious investment of the interest annually accruing.

At the commencement of operations definite lines of policy were
adopted, the object of which was to insure the expenditure of the income
in such a manner as most effectually to realize the conceptions of the
founder in his generous purpose of promoting the“ increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” Of the principles judged conducive to this
end an important one was embodied in the resolution to co-operate,
as far as possible, with individuals and institutions engaged in the
same work, especially with those in the city of Washington. An obvious
corollary of this was the determination to make no appropriation of the
funds to the furtherance or support of any object which could be accom-
plished as well by other instrumentality. This policy has been frequently
referred to in previous reports under the concisely expressed motto,
‘¢ co-operation not monopoly.”

It was in the spirit of this policy that the books of the Institution
were last year incorporated with those of Congress and results produced
which fully justify the measure as well as illustrate the importance of
the principle ; for, while by this union under one system and superintend-
ence a library has been formed worthy the National Capital, the capacity
of the Smithsonian fund to advance knowledge has been materially
increased. In pursuance of the same policy another important arrange-
ment has been made during the past year. I refer to the transfer of the
herbarium of the Institution to the care of the Department of Agriculture.
This herbarium consists of from 15,000 to 20,000 specimens from all parts
ofthe world, properly classified and labeled. Itis the result, in the line of ©
botany, of the various expeditions of the government and of the special
explorations of the Institution. The collections have from the first been
in the charge of Dr. Gray and Dr. Torrey—the two most eminent botan-
ists in this country—who have scientifically arranged them and formed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

the duplicates into sets for distribution. Dr. Gray has, however, left the
country for an absence of some years in Europe, and Dr. Torrey, who
has devoted at least two entire years of his life to these specimens, is
unable longer to continue this gratuitous and disinterested service on
account of the more imperious duties of his oflicial position, and
consequently intimated to us that the botanical specimens would have
to be removed from Columbia College, New York, where they have
been deposited under his care. To render such a collection of any
practical use, and to preserve the plants from decay, the constant super-
intendence of a competent botanist is obviously indispensable ; but as
the appropriation hitherto made by Congress is far too meagre to meet

he cost of the present support of the museum it was necessary to seek
some other means of providing for these plants. Now, as the Agricul-
tural Department requires for continual reference such a collection of
plants, and had begun to gather one ; and as, also, in the course of its in-
vestigations it has need of the services of a practical botanist, nothing
could seem more advisable than to unite the two collections. By this
arrangement not only are the series of plants themselves rendered more per-
fect and more readily accessible, but the Institution is in the same degree
relieved of the burden imposed upon it in the support of a multifarious
and rapidly increasing museum. The transfer, however, is made with
the understanding that the superintending botanist shall be approved
by the Institution, that the collection shall be accessible to the public
for practical or educational purposes, and to the Institution for scientific
investigation or fer supplying any information that may be asked for by
its correspondents in regard to the names and character of plants. It
is further stipulated that due credit shall be given to the Institution in the
publications of the department for the deposit of the original specimens
as well as for the additions which from time to time may be made to them
by the Institution.

Agreeably to the policy above mentioned, the Institution has also entered
into an arrangement with the medical department of the United States
army by which it was thought mutual convenience and harmonious co-op-
eration would be promoted. By this arrangement the Institution transfers
to the museum in charge of the Surgeon General its large collection of
human crania, and also all its specimens pertaining to anatomy, physi-
ology, medicine, and surgery, while it takes, in return, from the medical
museum all the collections which more properly relate to ethnology.
It will be seen that the object kept constantly in view in these trans-
actions is to render the various collections in Washington, which have
been made under the direction of the government and the Institution,
defivite parts of one harmonious system, and at the same time:to avoid
the loss of labor and of means, in duplicating and preserving articles of
a similar character in separate establishments.

The disposition, which up to this time, has been made of the plants
illustrates the plan which was adopted, from the first, in order to pro-
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

duce the most important results with a given expenditure of means.
The funds of the Institution, it was seen, were not sufficient to carry
out all the objects contemplated in the original law of organization. To
sustain properly a national museum and render it an efficient means of
popular instruction would require a number of professors of the ditter-
ent branches into which natural history has been divided. But, as the
income was manifestly insufficient for this purpose, the plan was adopted
of calling in, as far as possible, the aid of individual collaborators and
of other institutions. Agreeably to this principle of action the plants
were given in charge, as has been stated, to Doctors Gray and Tor-
rey for naming and arrangement into sets, and to the latter gentleman
for safe keeping until such time as means could be provided for their
maintenance in Washington.

For the same reason as that just given, all the type specimens of in-
sects which have been collected by the Institution have been divided
among collaborators for study and arrangement, to be reclaimed at any
time when required by the Institution. Nor is this system of co-operation
confined to this country, for while through its exchanges the Institution
holds friendly correspondence with all the principal scientific and literary
establishments of the Old World, with a number of them it maintains
relations of mutual co-operation in the way of affording assistance by
sending rare specimens and furnishing required data in cases of special
investigations.

While the result of the policy which has been adopted is the imme-
diate advancement of knowledge, it tends incidentally to render the
seat of government a venter of scientific activity, which enlarges its
reputation and extends its influence. Indeed, though Washington has
generally been regarded as almost exclusively a focus of political
agitation, it in reality contains a greater number of persons connected
with scientific operations, and interested in intellectual pursuits, than
any other city of equal population in this country. In illustration of
this remark I need only mention the officers of the Engineer Department,
of the Coast Survey, of the Light-house Board, of the Ordnance Bureau,
of the army and the navy, of the Patent Office, and of the Agricultural
Department; also the computors of the Nautical Almanac, the profes-
sors of the National Observatory, and those of three colleges, three
medical schools, a law school, and of an institution for the deat and
dumb; besides the the directors and assistants of the asylum for the
insane, two hospitals, and of the various bureaus of the government,
the greater part of whom are men of more than ordinary culture, on
many of whom the Institution can call for assistance and co-operation.

.

Pubiications—The Smithsonian publications, as has been frequently

stated before, are of three classes: the Contributions to Knowledge, the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. jl

Miscellaneous Collections, and the Annual Reports. The first consists of
memoirs containing positive additions to science resting on original
research, and which are principally the result of investigations to which
the institution has in some way rendered assistance. In all cases the
memoirs are submitted to a commission for critical examination, and
ouly accepted for publication on a favorable report. The Miscellaneous
Collections are chiefly composed of works intended to facilitate the
study of certain branches of natural history or of meteorology, and
are designed especially to induce individuals to engage in stu«ies as
specialties, to which in leisure moments their thoughts may reenr, and
by observations and collections in relation to which they may mot only
contribute to their own pleasure but also advance the cause of science..
The Annual Reports are published at the expense of the government,,
with the exception of the illustrations, which are furnished by the Insti-.
tution. Up to the year 1854 these reports were published in «pamphlet
form, and contained merely an account of the operations of the Institu--
tion for the year; but since that date an appendix has been aulded, prin--
cipally consisting of translations, from foreign journals, of articles not
accessible to the English reader, but of interest to our meteorological
observers, and to persons generally who are interested in the progress.
of knowledge. With the addition of this appendix each report forms a
volume of between 400 and 500 pages, bound in boards, with a cloth
cover. The first volume of this series contains a reprint of all the pre-
vious reports of the Secretary, the will of Smithson, and the enactments,
of Congress in regard to the bequest, and hence in the full set of these:
reports a continuous history of the Institution is given from its organiza-
tion to the present time. The whole number of volumes, including the:
present, is fifteen; of these it is to be regretted that the greater part. of the:
extra numbers were destroyed in the fire of 1865. All the reports:
since 1862 have been stereotyped, and the plates of these have beem
preserved.

During the past year the 15ch volume of the Smithsonian Contribu-
tions to Knowledge has been published, and, in conformity with the rules:
adopted, has been distributed to institutions in this country and abroad.
The volume contains 604 pages, and is illustrated with 43 woodcuts
and 17 plates. The several articles contained in fine volume which
were published separately, and an account of which was given in pre-
vious reports, are as follows:

1. An investigation of the Orbit of Neptune, with general tables of
its motion, by Professor Simon Newcomb.

2, On the fresh-water glacial drift of the northwestern States, hy
Charles Whittlesey.

3. Geological researches in China, Mongolia, and Japan, during the
years 1862 to 1865, by Raphael Pumpelly.

4, Physical observations in the Arctic seas, by Isaac I. Hayes, M. D.

Another publication during the year, which is intended to form a part

28
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of the 16th volume of the Contributions, is entitled “Results of
meteorological observations at Marietta, Ohio, between 1826 and 1859,”
by Dr. S. P. Hildreth. An account of this was given in the last report
under the head of meteorology, and copies of it have been distributed
to the meteorological observers. It contains 46 quarto pages, and is
illustrated with 14 woodcuts.

Several parts of the miscellaneous collections havealso been published.
The first is a catalogue of the Orthoptera or upright winged insects
of North America, described previous to 1867, prepared for the Smnith-
sonian Institution by Samuel H. Scudder, of the Boston Society of Nat-
ural History. This work is intended as an index in which the student
can find a reference to every published account of any species of
Orthoptera found on the continent of North America or in the West
Indies, together with the exact names given to the insects in the origi-
nal descriptions. The publication and distribution of this list will assist
the author himself in obtaining materials for a contemplated elaborate
monograph on the same subject, while it will tend to advance science
by calling attention to this interesting but heretofore little studied
order of insects; an order which includes, however, among others, the
cockroach and the grasshopper—the one so prejudicial to domestic com-
fort, and the other so often subversive of the hopes of the farmer. The
preparation of this work is a gratuitous contribution by Mr. Seudder to
the branch of natural history in which he is specially interested. It con-
sists of 89 octavo pages, and will form a part of the eighth volume of mis-
cellaneous collections.

The next publication of the year 1868 is a volume forming part
four of a series of monographs of the Diptera, or two-winged insects
of North America, by Baron R. Osten Sacken. Parts one and two
of the same series previously published by the Institution were prepared
by Dr. H. Loew, of Prussia, and the third part is in an advanced state
of preparation by the same author. This volume contains the first
part of a monograph of the North American Tipulidae, the representa-
tive of which is known as the crane-fly, an inseet whose larvze are
extremely destructive to crops of various kinds, devouring the roots of
cereals and pasture grasses, and almost all the plants ordinarily culti-
vated in fields or gardens. The ground covered by the author in this
monograph embraces all the known North American species, exclusive
of those of the West Indies and Mexico. The principal areas from
which the specimens described have been obtained are the environs of
the cities of Washington and of New York, but the author also made
collections during occasional excursions to different parts of New York,
Pennsylvania, and New England, besides receiving contributions from
other parts of this continent. Thus, as far as the more common species
are concerned, the middie and northern States may be said to be tolera-
bly well represented in this volume, the regions west of the Allegha-

nies and the British Provinces not so fully, while the country south of
Washington is, in this respect, almost entirely unexplored. The author
as well as the Institution is indebted to Mr. Samuel Powel, of Newport,
Rhode Island, an amateur and patron of science, for the devotion of
much time and practical skill to the preparation of magnified photo-
graphs of the wings, from which the illustrations presented on the steel
plates were reduced. This volume contains 345 pages, illustrated with
four plates and seven woodcuts.

Among the memoirs accepted for publication, and formerly described,
is one by Dr. John Dean, giving the results of a series of microscopical
investigations of the medulla oblongata. This paper was stereotyped and
about to be published as a part of the 13th volume of the Contributions,
when the expensive steel plates for its illustration were destroyed by
the fire of 1865. Owing to the absence of Dr. Dean in Europe, aconsid-
erable delay has occurred in procuring a new set of these illustrations.
The stereotype plates of the letter-press were, fortunately, preserved,
and we are now ready to publish an edition of the memoir for distribu-
tion as a part of the i6th volume of the Contributions.

Since the last report an elaborate work founded principally on original
research has been presented to the Institution, by Lewis H. Morgan,
esq., of Rochester, New York. It is on the systems of relationship
adopted by different races and tribes of men. About 20 years ago the
author found in use among the Iroquois Indians, of the State of New
York, a system for the designation and classification of family relationship
ofa singular character and wholly unlike any with which he was previously
familiar. Under this system, forexample, all the children of the several
brothers and sisters of an individual are considered as his own children ;
all the brothers of his father are habitually regarded and addressed as his
own father; all the sisters of his mother as his mother, &c. Mr. Morgan
afterwards found the same system in use among other Indian nations, in
which, while every term of relationship was radically different from the
corresponding terms in the Iroquois, the classification was the same.
Extending the research to other fields of inquiry, he found before the
close of 1559 that the same system prevailed among the principal Indian
nations east of the Rocky mountains, and that traces of it existed both in
the Sandwich Islands and in south India. He therefore resolved to prose-
cute the investigation upon a still more comprehensive scale, and to
attempt, if possible, to investigate the systems adopted by the different
families of mankind. This, however, required a more extensive foreign
correspondence than a private individual could hope suecessfully to
maintain. He therefore made application to the different boards of for-
eign missions, and also to the Smithsonian Institution, for such co-ope-
ration in the furtherance of his object as it migst be in their power to
afford. The Institution accordingly issued cirewlars and schedules,
which were distributed to its correspondents in all parts of the world.
Through his own immediate labors and the assistance just mentioned,
¥

20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

the author has been able to construct tables of relationship of as many
as 70 Indian nations, speaking as many independent dialects, and also
tables of the systems of the principal nations of Europe and Asia, a
portion of those of Africa, of Centrai and South America, and of the
islands of the Pacific. The tabulated schedules will represent the sys-
tems of relationship of upwards of four-fifths of the entire human family.

The memoir presents in a brief form the following systems or
methods of indicating the relatiops cf consanguinity: 1st. That of the
Aryan family, as typified by the Roman form. 2d. That of the Malayan
family, as indicated by the Hawaiian mode. 3d. That of the American
Indian family, as represented by the Seneca-Iroquois. According to the
author’s generalizations all these systems of consanguinity resolve
themselves into two radically distinct forms, one of which he calls the
descriptive and the other the classificatory form. The first assumes as
its fundamental basis the antecedent existence of marriage between sin-
gle pairs. Before it could have come into existence mankind must
have made some advanees in civilization; it follows the regular course
of descent, describing each individual with reference to his parental
derivation. In the second form the relation of cousanguinity is only
given in classes, the same term of consanguinity being applied to a
numberof persons not standing in precisely the same proximity of actual
relationship. This system, according to the author, seems to indicate
that it was adopted in a state of society in which marriage between sin-
ele pairs was unknown or exceptional. This memoir was first referred
to a commission, consisting of Professor J. H.Mecllvaine and Professor
William Henry Green, of Princeton, New Jersey, who recommended its
publication, but advised certain changes in the method of presenting
the subject. After these modifications had been made it was submitted
to the American Oriental Society and was by it referred to a special
committee, consisting of Messrs. Hadley, Trumbull, and Whitney, who,
having critically examined the memoir, reported that it contained a
series of highly interesting facts which they believed the students of
philology and ethnology, though they might not accept all the conclu-
sions of the author, wouid welcome as valuable contributions to science.

Besides the foregomg the following papers have been accepted for
publication and are now in the hands of the printer:

The IndiansofCape Fiattery: by J. G. Swan; Investigation of the Path
of a Meteorice Fire-ball: by Professor J. H. Coftin, of Lafayette College;
Description ofa part of a Mummy Case: by Dr. Gharits Pickering; Lane
and Fresh-water Shells of North America: by W. G. Binney and Thos.
Bland.

In addition to the foregoing the discussion and reduction of all the
observations relative to the rainfall of the north American continent
have been completed and will be published during 1859. The whole
ainount expended during the past year for publications was about $5,800,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

A larger sun, however, will be required for this purpose during the pres-
ent year.

The Smithsonian Institution is now in possession of a large amount of
manuscript material relative to the natural history, geology, and ethnology
of the whole of the northern part of the American continent, extending
from Labrador to Behring’s straits, and northward to the Arctic sea, includ-
ing Greenland and the vicinity of Von Wrangell’s land. These materials
have been derived principally from special explorations, directed by
the Smithsonian Institution, and with the co-operation to a greater or
less extent of the Chicago Academy of Sciences. They ae e been
gathered by the officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company, at their stations
in various parts of the northern portion of the continent, by the scien-
tifie corps of the Russian telegraph expedition, and by special explorers
acting under the immediate auspices of the Institution. That part which
relates to natural history is now nearly ready for the press, and will
probably be published during the coming year, while that relative to
physical geography is in an Aeieanoedl stage of preparation. This includes
all the scientific reports made to the Rican telegraph company by its
employés, and liberally furnished, by the company or its officers, to the
Institution. The material also contains a large number of vocabularies
as well as other information relative to the languages of the country,
which we hope soon to have in a proper state for publication. All
these contributions, together with the observations of Kane, McClintock,
and Hayes, which have been discussed and published by the Institution,
form no small addition to the knowledge of the North American conti-
nent, and will forever remain a monument of the munificence and a
memorial of the name of Smithson.

The annual report for the year 1867 was printed as usual by order of
Congress, and the extra number of 10,000 copies ordered as heretofore.
In addition to the report of the secretary, giving an account of the
operations, expenditures, and condition of the Institution for the year,
and the proceedings of the Board of Regents to May 2, 1868, it contains
the following articles: biographical notices of Professor C. C. Jewett,
formerly librarian of the Institution; of William Henry Harvey, of
Dublin, author of an extensive work on Algi, published by the Institu-
tion; memoirs of Legendre, Peltier, and Faraday; a sketch of the
history of the Royal Institution of Great Britain; a memoir on the
family Jussieu, and the natural method of classification in botany; the
natural history of organized bodies; the electrical currents of the earth;
considerations and facts relative to electricity; queries about expression
for anthropological inquiry; the various modes of flight in relation to
eronautiecs; man as the cotemporary of the mammoth and reindeer
in middle Europe; photo-chemistry; an account of the astronomical
observations at Dorpat and Poulkova; traces of the early mental con-
dition of man, account of Indian remains, ancient mounds, &e.; explora-
tions in Central America and Lake Winnepeg; sketch of the flora of

Alaska; various letters on meteorology; prize questions of societies in
Europe; and a list of abbreviations used in England at the present time.
This publication is constantly growing in popularity, and, next to the
report of the Agricultural Department, no document is in greater demand.
We may mention, as a proof of this, that a considerable portion of the
copies allowed the Institution for distribution among its own correspond-
ents has been absorbed, during the last year, in meeting the applications
of members of Congress for the supply of their constituents. In com-
plying with these applications we have never failed to represent that
a larger edition of the report is highly desirable for distribution, both by
the Institution and Congress, and that an addition of 5,000 copies to the
number which has been printed would cost comparatively but a trifle
after the stereotype plates have been placed upon the cylinder of the
printing press.

Explorations and collections in natural history —From the first estab-
lishment of the Smithsonian Institution until the present time a consid-
erable portion of its annual resources has been devoted to explorations
for the development of the natural productions of North and Central
America, particularly in relation to zoology, botany, and mineralogy. Of
late years a number of other institutions have entered the same field,
either independently or in co-operation with this Institution. Foremost
among those which have made separate explorations is the great museum
of comparative zoology at Cambridge, under the direction of Professor
Agassiz. The late expedition of this renowned naturalist to South
America has been crowned with a larger collection of specimens in
zoology than has ever been obtained through the exertions of private
enterprise. Among societies which have co-operated during the past year
with the Smithsonian, and scarcely in a rank below any other in regard
to zeal and efficiency, are the Chicago Academy of Science, the Boston
Society of Natural History, and the Peabody Museum of American
Archeology and Hthnology of Cambridge, Mass., as also the Kentucky
University of Lexington. In giving an account of what has been done
during the year under review in the line of natural history we shail
adopt, as in previous reports, the geographical order.

In reference to Arctic America the contributions from Mr. Macfarlane
and Mr. McDougal of the Mackenzie river district have added largely to
the materials previously received from that region, and are of special
interest in regard to Odlogy. The last invoice from Mr. Maefarlane is
fully equal to those with which he has favored the Institution in previous
years, and entitles him to the credit of being the largest contributor to’
the Smithsonian collections, and of having done more than any other
person in making known the productions and character of the regions
he has explored. The record of specimens bearing his name already
ainounts to over ten thousand’ entries, including some of the choicest
contributions to natural history and ethnology. A collection of birds

°
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ao

and eggs, including some new species of the latter from west of Lake
Winnipeg, has been received fror Mr. Donald Gunn, and of insects
and birds from the vicinity of Hudsen’s bay from Mr. James Lockhart
and Mr. B. R. Ross, to both of whom acknowledgments for valuable
services have been frequently rendered in previous reports.

Mr. W. H. Dall, who was mentioned in the last report as having suc-
ceeded Mr. Kennicott as chief of the natural history corps of the Russian
telegraph expedition, remained after the abandonment of that enterprise
to continue his explorations among the Indians and Esquimaux along the
Yukon, and within the Arctic Circle, including the most northern part of
our new possessions. He has just returned and brought with him a valua-

ble collection of the natural productions, as well as illustrations of the
ethnology of the regions he has visited. Mr. Dall visited Sitka with
the telegraph expedition, in 1865, then went to the Aleutian islands,
and afterwards to Plover bay, in Eastern Siberia. He spent the winter
of 1866 in the vicinity of St. Michaels, Norton’s sound; went the next
spring, with a single companion, to Fort Yukon, near the headwaters of
the river of the same name, and continued his explorations on either side of
the Arctic Circle until September, when he returned to Norton’s sound to
report the result of his labors to the engineer-in-chief of the telegraphic
expedition. But learning that the enterprise had been abandoned, he
concluded to remain in the country and continue the exploration on his
own account. In the prosecution of this purpose he left St. Michael’s
in October, and spent the following winter. among the Indians and
Esquimaux, in the region between the Yukon and Norton’s sound. In
the spring he descended the Yukon, and in July commenced his home-
ward journey. His collections are rich in birds, eggs, plants, smaller
animals, fish, fossils, and especially in ethnological illustrations. He
also made copious notes on the physical geography, geology, and meteer-
ology of the country. The first winter—1866~67—was very cold, the
thermometer descending, near Nulato, as low as 68° below zero. The
second was much warmer; rain fell almost every day, and, with the
exception of one occasion, the thermometer ranged from 10° below to
8° or 10° above the freezing point. <As if, however, to compensate for
his, the spring was longer and colder than had been known for 16 pre-
vious years. The short summers are quite warm, no show remaining on
the ground. Rapidly growing vegetables are cultivated by the Russian
traders, such as turnips, radishes, and lettuce. An attempt to grow
potatoes failed at St. Michael’s, although a similar experiment is said to
have been successful at Fort Yukon. This part of the country is of no
value in an agricultural point of view, but affords an abundance of rich
furs. It is thickly wooded in the interior, principally with spruce, pep-
lar, and willow. Mr. Dall was kindly entertained by the inhabitants,
who, on all the coasts north of the Aleutian islands and on that of the
Arctic sea, consist of Esquimaux, while the inhabitants of the interior
are Indians.

24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The expenses of original outfit for making collections in natural his-
tory during the telegraphic expedition were defrayed by the joint
contributions of this Institution and the Chicago Academy of Science.
Subsequently the telegraphic company itself made liberal provisions for
facilitating the same object, and for furthering, as far as compatible
with the primary intention of the enterprise, the advance of science.
The costs of the expedition of Mr. Dall, after he left the service of the tel-
egraph company, were borne by himseli, and the results generously pre-
sented as a contribution to the cause to which he has shown himself so
ardently attached. The transportation of all the collections from the west-
ern coast devolved upon the Lnstitution, and but for the generous assist-
ance of the Pacifie Mail Steamship Company, it would have called for a
larger outlay than we couid well have afforded. Since Mr. Dall’s return he
has occupied a room in the Smithsonian building, and has been engaged
in arranging and labeling his specimens preparatory to the forma-
tion of a descriptive catalogue. While he has been occupied in this
work the Boston Socrety of Natural History, as well as the Institution,
has contributed to his support, with the understanding that the former
is to have a portion of the duplicates set apart for distribution.

Other collections of interest have also been received from Alaska, viz:
those made by Mr. Bischotl, at Kodiak; and by Dr. Minor, in various
localities visited during the cruise of the Wayanda; others still, from.
Captain White, of the same steamer; also from Captain Tinea and
Mr. George Davidson, of the United States Coast Survey.

Western United States.—The Institution still continues to receive speci-
meus from the Pacific coast, and frequent communications relative to the
physical geography, meteorology, and ethnology of the country. Dur-
ing the past year among the more important collections from California
was a series of nests and eggs from Dr. Canfield, of Monterey, and of
birds and shells from Mr. kh. E. C. Stéarns. But the most important
exploration undertaken since the date of the last report has been that
uuder the direction of Mr. Clarence King, authorized by Congress for a
geological survey of the 40th parallel of latitude, principally in Nevada
and the western portion of Utah. The resuits of this exploration are
especially important from’ the facts obtained relative to the physical
geography aud meteorology ad the country. A base line in a north and
south direction was measured by astronomical observations at the two
extremities, and from this a het-work of triangles was extended over the
region surveyed, by which the topography was determined and the
materials furnished of an accurate map of a part of the country previ-
ously imperfectly known. The party consisted of four geologists,
including Mr. King, four topographers, two botanists, one zoologist, and
one meteorologist. All the specimens collected, filling 60 boxes, with the
exception of those of botany, have been received at the Institution, and
are now in process of being arranged for study and subsequent distribu-
tion. The botanical collections have been given in charge to Professor
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. pa)

Eaton, of Yale College, for the determination of the species and their
relations to the flora of other portions of the United States, but will finally
be sent to the Institution, to the care of which all specimens collected
by government expeditions are assigned. Inthe same connection it may
be mentioned that Dr. Hitz has continued his explorations on the upper
Missouri, and contributed specimens of fossils, skins of birds, eggs, &e.

At the last session of Congress an appropriation was made for explor-
ations under the direction of the Land Oifice. This survey, the conduct
of which was consigned to Dr. IF’. V. Hayden, extended over the Black
hills, Laramie plains, the headwaters of the Little and Big Laramie
rivers to Bridger’s: pass. It also included a survey along the Pacific
railroad from Fort Saunders to Green river. The report of this survey
has been made to Joseph 8. Wilson, esq., the Commissioner of the Land
Office, with whom ail the specimens collected have been deposited. Dr.
Hayden, however, made an independent su-vey under the auspices of
the Institution, along the eastern base of the Rocky mountains to Den-
ver city, and southward to the Sangre de Christo pass, across the San
Luis Potosi park and the valley of the Rio Grande, and thence into New
Mexico, returning northward through the Poncho pass, across the Arkan-
sas into the South park, and through this into the mining regions of Col-
orado. Besides the geological notes whith were made during this
expedition, a large number of specimens was collected; and as no appro-
priation of Congress was made for the transportation of the latter, the
cost has been defrayed by the Institution. ‘The specimens have been
received and are now awaiting their examination and final disposition.
Another exploration which will be mentioned under the head of
ethnology, was conducted by Dr. KE. Palmer, in the Indian territory,
the collections from which were but little less important as illustrative
of natural history than of Indian life and ethnology. Dr. Palmer is now
in the Institution assorting the specimens and preparing his notes for
publication.

Middle and South America.—Colonel Grayson has been engaged in prose-
euting his exploration in northwestern Mexico, and has furnished large
collections of its ornithology. To him more than to any other may justly
be ascribed, says Professor Baird, a knowledge of the species of birds of
that region. Under the joint auspices of the Smithsonian Institution and
the Kentucky University, at Lexington, Professor Sumichrast, a well-
known naturalist long resident in Mexico, has gone to the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec to make observations and collections in natural history,
which will doubtless throw light upon the geographical distribution of spe-
cies. Two boxes of specimens have just been received as the first fruits of
this expedition. Dr. Sartorius has also continued his important contribu-
tions from Mirador. Explorations have been further prosecuted in Costa

tica, a region which has been the subject of much attention on the part
of the Institution, and a valuable collection of specimens has been
received from Mr. M. Calleja, made by himself and Mr. J. Zeledon, as
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

well as contributions from Dr. Von Frantzius, from Captain J. M. Dow,
Mr. Henry Hague, Mr. George Latimer, Dr. Destruges, and other cor-
respondents mentioned in the list of donors. A series of birds of the
Galapagos islands has been presented by the Swedish Academy

Sciences through Professor Sundevall, furnishing us with the first illus-
trations of the fauna of that group, so remarkable for its land and marine
animals. Mr. W. H. Hudson has continued to make collections of birds
in the Argentine provinces, and Mr. Albuquerque and Dr. Smith have
rendered the same service in regard to those of Brazil. Specimens from
Peru have been received from Dr. Sclater, while Mr. Salvin has sent
types of several new species from Veragua, on the isthmus of Panama.

Explorations and collections in ethnology.—During the past year greater
effort has been made than ever before to collect specimens to illustrate
the ethnology and archeology of the North American continent. This
subject, it is true, has from the first been an object of interest to the
Institution, as being a common ground on which the cultivators of
scienee and of literattire might harmoniously co-operate. It embraces
not only the natural history and peculiarities of the different races of
men:as they now exist upon the globe, but also their affiliations, their
changes in mental and moral development, and also the question of the
geological epoch of the appearance of man upon the earth. So a
interest has been awakened in the general subject, that Mr. George -
body, with an enlightened liberality, has presented $159,000 to Hi: ona
University, at Cambridge, for the foundation and maintenance of a
museum and professorship of American ethnology and archeology,
Although the funds of that establishment are not yet fully available.
measures have been taken, under the direction of Professor Jeiiries
Wyman, to secure European specimens for comparison, and also to com-
mence the collection of original records of the races of our continent.
The Smithsonian Institution having inaugurated a number of special
explorations, embracing ethnology as well as natural history, has
invited the Peabody museum to co-operate in the enterprises, by con-
tributing funds, witha view to sharing the results of the expeditions.

his proposition has been favorably entertained, and an appropriation
been made to assist an important exploration of ancient mounds in
Kentucky, under the direction of Mr. Sidney 8S. Lyon. We cherish the
hope that, as the funds of the Peabody museum become more and more
available, our union of effort to extensively examine the monuments
and collect all the relies, to illustrate as fully as possible the archeology
and ethnology of the American continent, will be crowned with success, °

The interest in the archeological remains of America is by no means
confined to this country. They are considered of much importance in
Europe in the way of comparison with those of the old worid, and speci-
mens have been diligently sought for by collectors from abroad. Mr.
William Blackmore, of Liverpool, in particular, a gentleman of wealth

ry
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. QF

and intelligence who has founded an ethnological museum at Salis-
bury, has made several visits to this country for the purpose of obtain-
ing additions to his collections. He has purchased of Dr. E. H. Davis,
for a large sum of money, the archeological specimens described and
figured in volume I of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.
Though it may, perhaps, be a matter of regret that Congress did not
make an appropriation for the purchase of these interesting specimens,
it is still gratifying to the lovers of science, irrespective of nationality,
that they will be perpetually preserved and rendered available for the
advancement of ethnology. While we ourselves were not able to retain
in this country the originals, we have procured a complete set of fac-
similes in plaster, which, for general investigation, are nearly as valua-
ble as those from which they were taken.

The Institution is indebted to Mr. Blackmore for a series of pho-
tographs of American Indians; a model of Stonehenge; a number
of electrotype copies of ancient medals; and a copy of a work writ-
ten by Thomas Inman, M. D., for private distribution, on “ Ancient
Faith embodied in Ancient Names.” Mr. Blackmore is enthusias-
tically interested in ethnology, and devotes his spare time, as weil
as a large portion of his ample means, to the prosecution of the
subject. The museum which he has founded and munificently endowed
consists of specimens intended to illustrate the anthropology of every
part of the world, and is freely opened to the public, either for casual
visits or for critical study. An account of it will be given in the appen-
dix of this report, under the head of ethnology. We have found in Mr,
Blackmore an efficient and liberal collaborator, who evinces a disposi-
tion amply to repay, in returns of specimens and information, the con-
tributions we may be able to make to the stores he has already accumu-
lated. In his late visit to this country he thinks he has found speci-
mens of the early drift period, or of the first indications of the works of
man on the earth, not previously known to exist on this continent. The
locality of these remains is about 50 miles from Fort Bridger, in Utah
Territory, and will not be forgotten as a point of special interest in our
explorations.

It is now generally known that, in times long anterior to the dawn of
authentic history, the practice extensively prevailed of constructing
human habitations upon wooden piles driven into the shallow water of
lakes, remains of which have been found especially in Switzerland, but
also in other countries. Upon these piles platforms were placed and
habitations erected, not for temporary occupation, merely, but for pro-
longed residence. Of these archeological remains accounts have been
given in previous reports, and during the past year arrangements have
been made, through the exchanges of the Institution, to obtain speci-
mens from the more important localities in which they are found.

The following is an account of the more important explorations and
additions to the collections of the Institution which have been made
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

during the past year in the line of ethnology. The first in value is that
already referred to as having been undertaken under the joint auspices of
the Institution and the Peabody Museum, by Mr.8.S. Lyon, of Indiana. In
this exploration a number of mounds in Kentueky were opened, and more
than fifty perfect crania, with many imperfect ones, andaconsiderable num-
ber of skeletons, were procured. There were disinterred also about thirty
vases more or less periect, a large number of stone axes, hammers, orna-
ments, beads, bone awls, &c., the whole filling seven barrels and four
boxes with extremely valuable material. The crania and bones were
referred to Dr. Wyman for special investigation, who reports that they
had been received, that he had nearly finished cleaning the skulls, which
would require many repairs, but that he hoped to do justice to a collec.
tion which affords an opportunity never before equaled of examining the
skulls of American aborigines. Mr. Lyon’s exploration has also fur-
nished a series of ancient implements as well as casts of footprints
sculptured in the rocks. Inmitations of this kind, which have been fre-
quently found, were for a long time supposed to have been formed by
the actual impressions of human feet when the rock was in a soft con-
dition, but subsequent investigations have shown them to be undoubtedly
sculptured imitations of footprints. They have occasionally been found
in rocks containing pebbles, but in these cases the pebbles, instead of
bearing evidence of having been pressed down into a plastic material
by a human foot, show clearly that they have been cut by the tool of a
workman.

Professor J. W. P. Jenks, of Middleboro’, Massachusetts, who has for
many years been collecting objects of ethnology, has, in a spirit of praise-
worthy liberality, allowed the Institution to select any specimens it
might desire from his extensive cabinet. From the same place, some
choice objects have also been received from Mr. Sylvester, as well as
an interesting stone mortar and a stone axe, respectively the gift of Mr.
E. Shaw and Mr. U. Sampson. Mr. Gregory, of Marblehead, has fur-
nished some desirable specimens from castern Massachusetts, as have
also Mr. Levi Cole, of Beverly, Dr. Palmer, of Ipswich, Mr. Blake, of
Boston, Mr. Burr, Mrs. Bryant, Mr. Jas. T. Ames, &c. To Amherst
College, through Professor Hitchcock, the Institution is indebted for a
large nuinber of stone implements from western Massachusetts and Con-
necticut. Explorations of ancient Indian graves were also made, with
satisfactory results, near Hingham, Massachusetts, by Professor Baird,
in conjunction with Dr. Brewer, Messrs. John Brewer, T. J. Bouve, F.
Burr, Gerrish, and Wells.

To Dr. W. Wood, of East Windsor Hill, Connecticut, the Institution
is under obligations for his diligent efforts to increase its archaeological
collections; a number of boxes have been received from him filled with
articles illustrative of the primitive stone implements of Connecticut.
Valued contributions from an adjacent locality have also been received
from Mr. Andrus. Special contributions of implements previously col-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

lected in Maine, New Brunswick, and Pennsylvania, were likewise made
by Mr. Boardman, Dr. Todd, Mr. Blake, Mr. Haley, Mr. Leonard Pea-
body, Mr. Hollis, and Mr. J. Hamiiton. From Colonel E. Jewett, of
Utica, the Institution has received an extensive and chvice coliec-
tion of relics especially rich in pipes and ornaments, beads, amuiets,
&c., gathered principally in New York and adjacent States. Mr. Robert
Howell, of Tioga county, New York, has made several interesting con-
tributions in the same line, and others have been received from the same
region at the hands of Mr. Stephen Forman and Mr. Jacob Stratton.
Scarcely inferior in exteyt and variety to the collection of Mr. Jenks is
one made by the late Hon. George M. Keim, of Reading, principally ia
central Pennsylvania, but also in Texas and Ohio. In this is found the
first specimen of a choice flint hoe, similar to that described by Professor
Rau, in the Smithsonian Report for 1863, a second specimen of which has
just been received from Mr. Granville Turner, of Lilinois. The collection of
Gereral Keim was presented to the Institution by his children as a memo-
rial of their father, and a very large and choice cabinet of minerals has, we
learn, been given by them to Lehigh University with a similar object,
Specimens from western Pennsylvania have been received from Dr. Wal-
ker.

The principal donations from the vicinity of Washington have been
made by Mr. O. N. Bryan, some of which are very choice; by Mr. J. W.
Slagle, and Mr. Tyler. Specimens from the eastern shore of Virginia
have been presented by Mr. C. KR. Moore. Mr. W. H. Edwards, of West
Virginia, has contributed a-number of choice articles from the Kanawha
river and elsewhere, some of them unique. Mr. E. A. Dayton, an
esteemed correspondent of the Institution, in the course of an extended
tour through Tennessee and Kentucky last year, took advantage of the
occasion to gather collections, and awaken an interest in the subject
which has resulted in large additions to our cabinet. Our attention
having been called by Mr. Dayton toa remarkable stone idol found near
the mouth of a cave at Strawberry Plains, Tennessee, a correspondence
was entered into with its owner, Captain E. M. Grant, which resulted
in its being sent to the Institution. The most important collection of
ethnological material yet received, however, is that presented by Captain
J. H. Devereux, of Cleveland, Ohio, embracing a large number of nearly
every variety of ancient stone implements, principally of Tennessee and
Ohio, among them specimens of pottery of very different patterns
- from those usuaily met with. Some of them are remarkable for smooth-
ness of surface and symmetry of outline, as well as for the style of orna-
mentation. We have stated before that a series of casts of the principal
objects described in the first volume of the Smithsonian Contributions to
Knaowledge had been purchased, and it may be mentioned in this con-
nection that other articles described in the same volume are in posses-
sionof Mr. W. S. Vaux, of Philadelphia, who obtained them through the
purchase of the valuable collection of Mr. James McBride, of Ohio, whose

cabinet was freely open for study to Squier and Davis. From Lieu-
tenant Belden and Captain Mills, of the United States army, Drs. C.
C. Gray and Matthews, fine collections of dresses and implements of exist-
ing tribes of Indians have been received. The most extensive series,
however, of modern objects of this kind pertaining to the United States,
and obtained during the year under review, is that gathered by Dr.
Edward Palmer, in the Indian territory, including specimens relating to
the Comanches, Kioways, and other neighboring tribes. The collection
consists of war implements, such as bows, arrows, shields, battie-axes ;
hunting and fishing implements, such as hooks, spears, nets, &¢.; a
large variety of dresses, ornaments, including ear and finger rings,
breast-plates, &c.; tobacco-pouches, pipes of various materials, bowis,
spoons made of wood and horn, a variety of whips, articles used for
gainbling, including packs of cards made of skins, and bundles of sticks
with which bets are decided, from the manner in which they fall when
thrown upwards; also floor coverings made of parallel sticks attached
by sinews; the whole forming very complete illustrations of the manners
and customs of the tribes before mentione 1.

Some of the most important additions of the year to the stone series
were included in a collection presented by Dr. Yates, of California.
This collection embraced, in addition to a number of characteristic
implements of the natives of California, moulds of those found under the
lava of Table mountain, and which formed the subject of an animated
discussion at the meeting of the American Association in Chicago last
summer. Itis proposed to make casts from these moulds for distribution
to the principal museums in this country and abroad. Hxtensive collec-
tions were made in Alaska, during the year, by Dr. T. T. Minor, surgeon
of the United States steamer Wayanda, embracing stone articles of supe-
rior finish. Other objects, to which much value is attached, from the
same region, have been received from Captain Howard and Captain J.
W. White; and very extensive collections made by Mr. Dall are on their
way. Mr. R. Macfarlane and Mr. Strachan Jones have furnished con-
tinuations of collections previously contributed, in articles relative to the
Esquimaux of the northern coast of America. Thanks to the co-opera-
tion of the officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company, among whom may be
mentioned Messrs. Ross, Gaudet, Hardisty, and Kirkby, but especially
Maciarlane, the Institution is in possession of what would appear to be
a full representation of the life of the Esquimaux of that region, as illus-
trated by their dresses, weapons of war, their implements for fishing and
the chase, household articles, ornaments, &e.

In this connection mention should not be omitted of a number of
interesting stone implements contributed by Mrs. H. R. Schoolcraft, of
Washington, the widow of the celebrated ethnologist, some of which are
described in his elaborate work on the Indian tribes of North America.
Among other articles for which the Institution is indebted to the liber-
ality of Mrs. Schooleraft is a cast of the inscription on Dighton Rock,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

Massachusetts, sometimes supposed to be of Runic origin, but which,
like the drawings on the same rock, are generally considered as having
been made by the primitive Indian occupants of that region.

It will have been observed that nearly all the additions to the ethno-
logical collections referred to, have been from the United States and
British possessions. Very important donations have, however, been
received from other parts of America. Captain J. M. Dow, of New
York, has presented the Institution with a collection of ancient pottery,
of stone images and implements from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Chiri-
qui, some of them of remarkable character. Other specimens of Chiriqui
pottery were included in the collection of Colonel Jewett, already referred
to. Mr. George A. Latimer, of Porto Rico, has presented remarka-
ble stone implements of the ancient inhabitants of the West Indies,
among which is a specimen in the shape of an ellipsoidal stone ring, not
unlike a horse collar in form, though rather less in size, being about 15
inches in its largest diameter. It was possibly worn about the neck as
a badge of office in public processions. From Captain Dow we have
received ancther wrought stone in the form of a large inverted U. It is
conjectured that it might have been placed across the neck of the
victim when stretched on the altar of sacrifice.

The occasion here presents itself of stating that in a communication,
through the Department of State, from Mr. de Cesnola, United States
consul at Cyprus, we were informed that a remarkable discovery of
Pheenician and Greek antiquities had lately been made in that island,
and that two boxes of the specimens were in readiness to be transmitted
to Washington as presents for the National Museum. On the receipt of
this information a letter was addressed to the Secretary of the Navy,
asking that, if not incompatible with the rules of the service, some
United States vessel, being in the vicinity, might be authorized to stop
at the island and procure the articles above designated. To this letter
a prompt answer was received from the Navy Department, containing
the information that orders in accordance with the request had been
issued to the commander of the Mediterranean squadron. The follow-
ing are some of the facts in regard to the discovery in question. In the
month of December, 1867, a Greek laborer, digging for building-stone
within the precincts of a little village called Galli, found a very old oven-
shaped tomb, containing pieces of skulls and other bones, and also some
curious colored vases. On examining the ground a few yards in circuit
other tombs were found, indicating the existence of an ancient burial-
site. The discovery was kept secret from the authorities of the
place, but was disclosed to the foreign consuls on the island, by whom
the search was prosecuted. The American consul, Mr. Cesnola, obtained
from the Turkish government at Constantinople a firman allowing him
to search for antiquities wherever he might desire. With this he sue-
ceeded in discovering the existence of a series of Phcenician tombs
beneath the ancient .Greek burial ground. These tombs, which were
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

oven-shaped, with the mouth closed by large stones, were six and a hal¢
feet below the level of the Greek interments, and ae nine to eleven
feet below the surface of the earth. The articles found in the graves
and tombs were of gold, silver, precious stones, bronze, copper, giass
marble, and terra cotta. The whole collection numbered 2,310 pieces;
the expense of the digging, $7,300 in gold, was defrayed by an asso-
ciation composed of the English, French, onl American cousuls, and an
English banker. We need not say that the safe arrival of the portion
of these relies intended by Mr. Cesnola for the Smithsonian Institution
will be looked forward to with much interest.

But the explorations of the Institution in regard to ethnology have
not been confined to the contents of mounds or to implements gathered
from the surface of the ground, or brought to light by casual excavation.
It is well known that in almost every part of the world contiguous to
the sea there exist accumulations of shells collected into heaps or
mounds. These mounds were long supposed to have been produced by
natural causes, but comparatively recent investigations have shown that
they are the remains of the festal or daily repasts of the ancient inhabit-
ants. Thus their examination becomes an object of special interest; yet
nothing had been done in this department of research in our Own coun-
try until lately, when examinations were commenced by Professor Rau
in New Jersey, Professor Wyman on the coasts of Florida, Maime, and
Massachusetts, and by gentlemen connected with the Essex Lustitute,
(now the Peabody Academy of Science,) in the vicinity of Salem,
Massachusetts. During last summer, Professor Baird, of this Institu-
tion, after taking part in the Salem exploration, instituted an investiga-
tion as to the shell-heaps of the coast of New Brunswick. In this
enterprise he received the voluntary assistance of Mr. G. A. Boardman,
Dr. Todd, of St. Stephens, Mr. Josiah Simpson, of St. David's, and Dr.

-arker, a St. Andrews. They examined several new depositories, which
yielded unexpectedly large numbers of implements of horn, bone, and
stone, together with the remains of the animals which had served as food.
Of this exploration a full account will hereafter be prepared for pubii-
cation in the report of the Institution.

Nor yet are lacustrian struetures and shell heaps the only sources
from which a knowledge of the manners and customs of pre-historic times
may be acquired. The early inhabitants of almost every part of the
world took advantage of natural caverns as places of shelter, and in
these have left the indications of their former presence. An examination
of the deposits of earth on the floors of these caverns, and sometimes
even beneath the incrustations produced by the evaporation of the water
charged with lime, which has dripped from the ceiling, have often dis-
closed the bones of men, and also artificial implements, mingled with
the remains of extinct animals. A cave of this kind, in central Penn-
sylvania, was examined a number of years ago by Professe Baird, not
with a view to the discovery of archeological remains, but those of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 30

animals which might have inhabited the cavern in previous geological
periods. The débris which he obtained were carefully preserved, but
not subjected to a critical examination. The Professor, however, has
more recently resumed the investigation in the light which new facts
haye shed upon the connection of these caves and their contents with
the character, the pursuits, and the condition of men in pre-historic
times. An account of the result of these researches will also, in due
time, be published.

The ethnological specimens we have mentioned are not considered as
mere curiosities collected to excite the wonder of the illiterate, but as
contributions to the materials from which it will be practicable to recon-
struct by analogy and strict deduction the history of the past in its rela-
tion to the present. in the case of the remains of animals and plants,
from which the geologist reconstructs the flora and fauna of ancient
times, inferences are drawn from petrifactions, shells, bones and teeth.
These, however, are not sufficient in the case of anthropology, and, in
addition to the study of human skeletons and crania, recourse must be
had to the relies of the works of the men of the past; to the remains of
their houses, tombs, fortifications, temples, implements, and ornaments,
in order to determine their relation to the races which now inhabit the
earth. Ethnology, it must be admitted, is at present in an elementary
condition: in the period through which all science must necessarily
pass—that of the collection of material; and, consequently, the only
deductions which can be drawn to-day are principally of a provisional
character. It is true that the evidences in favor of the greater antiquity
of the appearance of man on the surface of the earth than has been
heretofore generally admitted have been accumulating from year to
year, yet it can scarcely be said with fairness that the question is fully
settled. Other hypotheses than those which have been advanced may
be suggested to explain the facts observed. But, be this as it may, the
investigation should be prosecuted without regard to preconceived
views. We may rest satisfied that religion and true science cannot be
at' variance; the one properly understood, and the other rightly inter-
preted, must agree in final results. In short, we should follow the rule
laid down by the Bishop of London in a lecture delivered at Edinburg,
that: “The man of science should go on honestly, patiently, diffidently
—observing and storing up his observations and carrying his reasonings
unflinchingly to their legitimate conclusions, convinced that it would be
treason to the majesty at once of science and of religion if he sought to
help either by swerving ever so little from the straight line of truth.”
Care however must be taken that the provisional hypotheses of science
are not mistaken for absolute truths, and premature attempts be made
to explain discrepancies between the two great domains of thought,
which, after all, may arise from partial views of the connection of
phenomena.

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Museum, and care of specimens.—The exhibition rooms, to which the
public generally have admission, have been limited since the fire to the
large hall on the first floor of the main building, and the apartment on
the same floor in the southern projection, the latter containing ethno-
logical specimens of a large size, principally from Central America, the
former, the general collection brought home by the Wilkes Exploring
Expedition, and the large additions since made to it by the several
explorations under the direction of officers of the general government.

It is greatly to be regretted that in the original plan of the building
proper attention had not been given to the purposes to which it was to
be applied. The spacious room, in which the rich collections of ornitho-
logy and ethnology are contained, presents to the eye a succession of large
pillars which obstruct the view of the cases containing the specimens,
and it is only by a separate examination of the contents of these cases
that the value of the collections can be duly estimated. In fitting up
the room of corresponding dimensions in the second story, an opportu-
nity will be afforded of adopting arrangements far better suited for a
comprehensive display of the vast number of objects with which in time
it will be furnished.

During the past year, in addition to the rooms before mentioned, the
west connecting range has been provided with cases for which the Insti-
tution is indebted to the Commissioner of Patents, and to which will be
transferred, in the course of a few weeks, the ethnological specimens from
China and Japan, a part of which are still in the Patent Office. It is
intended to devote the whole of this room to ethnological specimens,
especially those illustrating the dress of the different inhabitants of North
America. The west wing of the building, previously occupied by the
library, is temporarily appropriated to the alcoholic specimens, and to
such other collections as are not of special interest to the zeneral public;
it is used also for storing duplicates for distribution.

For the support of the museum during the last year Congress appro-
priated $4,000, while the actual expense of the care and preservation of
the collections, independent of the interest on the cost of the building,
was upwards of $10,000. If to this be added only $10,000 for the rent
of the apartments, it will be seen that the cost of the museumto the Insti-
tution cannot be estimated at less than $20,000 per annum.

The steady increase in the receipt of specimens has been maintained,
and has fully equalled in number and value that of any preceding year.
The different additions were from 186 different parties, and were contained
in 308 boxes, 149 bundles, 19 jars and cans, 2 kegs, and 7 casks ; 485 in
all, inclosing many thousand specimens, a detailed notice of which will
be found in the appendix to this report. It should be remarked that all
these specimens are not intended to swell the number exhibited in the
nationai museum, but that only the type specimens of such as are not
already in the collection are to be devoted to this purpose, and the
remainder made up into sets for distribution.

.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

From the large accessions of specimens received during the year, much
labor has been required merely to unpack, arrange, and catalogue thein.
The great importance should be borne in mind of prompt action in regard
to affixing some permanent mark to each article so as to presevre all the
data necessary to render it of value as material for scientifie research.
The locality and date of capture of every object of natural history, the
‘name of the collector and donor, its association in place with other objects,
its sex and age, are all points which can rarely be learned from the spe-
cimen itself and must be immediately recorded. This is done by affixing
an ineffaceable number to the specimen and making an entry correspond-
ing to that number in a bound record book kept in a fire-proof room.
Whenever a specimen admits of it, the items above mentioned are marked
upon the object itself, but as long as the numbers and records are in
existence the identity of the article can always be verified and the facts
in regard to it ascertained. The determination of the exact name of the
specimen at the time of entry is a secondary matter, as the specialist can
at any time ascertain this point from the internal evidence; the other
data, being entirely those of association, cannot be ascertained in the
same way.

Special attention has been given to the large ethnological collections
belonging to the Institution, and considerable progress been made towards
their permanent arrangement. The smaller objects, such as pipes, carved
bones, stone implements, &c., will be mounted as soon as practicable on
suitable tablets; all the older articles have been washed with a solution
of carbolic acid, to destroy the mould produced by the water with which
the building was deluged at the time of the fire, and such of the new ones
as are liable to attacks from insects have been impregnated with poison.
Each object of the collection will have the name of the donor, locality, &e.,
placed upon it, and the whole series will be completely arranged for
study and exhibition during the present year. The principal work in
this branch has been done under the direction of Prof. Baird, by Dr. E.
Foreman and Dr. E. Palmer.

Other objects that have received attention in the way of rearrange-
ment and improvement are those of human and other crania, shells,
mounted birds, nests and eggs, &c., in which labor Professor Baird has
been assisted by Dr.T M. Brewer, Dr. William Stimpson, Dr. E. Foreman,
Mr. W. H. Dall, Mr. Zeledon, and Mr. R. Ridgway.

Among the most interesting collections received from abroad, in return
for specimens presented by the Institution, may be mentioned a series
of minerals and rocks from the K. Ober-Berg Amt, of Breslau, and a
skeleton of the moose of Europe, from the zoological museum, Copenha-
gen. The latter will furnish the means of comparing the European va-
riety with the closely allied if not identical moose of northern America.
Of the living animals received from different parts of this country, it will
suffice to mention a golden eagle, from Professor H. Shimer; a number of
menopomas from Dr. Walker; gopher turtles from Dr. Wilson; and a
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Rocky mountain salamander from Mr. J. C. Brevoort. It will be recol-
lected that the living animals of a larger size heretofore presented to
the Institution have been transferred to the National Asylum for the
Insane, under the care of Dr. Nichols.

Distribution of specimens.—The distribution of duplicate specimens to
public museums and in exchange has been prosecuted as extensively
during the year as was compatible with the large additions continually
coming in and requiring immediate attention. The surplus material of
plants, shells, minerals, and fossils has been, however, to a considerable
extent, made up into sets, and supplied as far as they would go to the
parties having the first claim. Other collections, however, wail be ready
for similar distribution as soon as the investigations connected with them
and their arrangement into sets can be completed. The great amount
of. labor required for this will be evident when it is recollected that every
specimen sent out is numbered and accompanied by a label giving the
1ame, locality, and donor. Professor Baird, who has the special charge
of this branch of the operations, has been assisted in his labors by a
number of young gentlemen, who having been engaged during the sum-
mer in explorations, avail themselves in the winter season of the facili-
ties of the library, the collections, and apartments furnished by the Insti-
tution to prepare their reports for publication. Those who are at present
rendering service of the kind above mentioned are Messrs. Meek, Dall,
Palmer, Zeledon, Bannister, and Ridgway.

Agreeably to theresolutionsadopted by the Board of Regents at its last
session, that “the distribution of specimens to foreign establishments, ear-
ried on by the Smithsonian Institution, be continued and extended, but
that at the same time proper returns be required,” we have applied to
the leading foreign museums which have been favored by our contribu-
tions for desiderata especially needed in this country, and have the assur-
ance that in due time valuable collections will be transmitted to us from
all parts of the world.

Among the establishments to which application has thus been made
and a favorable response received, are: The British Museum and Royal
College of Surgeons, London; Archeological Museum, Zurich; Public Mu-
seum, Berne; Museum of Lausanne; Academy of Sciences, and Botanical
Garden, St. Petersburg; Royal Museum, Lisbon; Kthnological Museum,
Moscow; Ethnological Museum of University of Christiania; Zoological
Museum, Copenhagen; Zoological Museum of University of Berlin;
Academy of Sciences and National Museum of Antiquity, Stockholm;
Imperial Geological Institute, Vienna; University of Chile; Philosophical
Society, Leeds; Ethnological Museum, Paris; Melbourne Museum, Aus-
tralia.

Investigations.—It has always been the policy of the Institution to furnish

specimens for special study and investigation to naturalists of established
reputation, either in thisecountry orabroad. The use of these specimens is

s
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

granted under the express condition that they are to form the subject of
investigation, the results of which are to be published by the Institution
or some other establishment, and that in all cases full credit is to be
given to the Institution for the assistance it has rendered. Furthermore,
in the case of the preparation of a monograph, a full set of the type
specimens, correctly labeled, is to be put aside for the National Museum,
and the remainder of the specimens made up into sets for distribution.
The following list presents the more important cases of the loan or
assignment of materials during the past year. Some of the specimens
have already been returned, while the remainder are still in the hands
of the parties to whom they were intrusted:

Crania of the recent and fossil bison, musk ox, &c., to Professor L.
Agassiz, of Cambridge, Mass.; land shells of Central and South America
to Thomas Bland, of New York; land and fresh water shells of North
America to W. G. Binney, Burlington, N. J.; nests and eggs of North
American birds to Dr. T. M. Brewer, Boston; birds of South America and
Alaska to John Cassin, Piiadelpina Ales aa of North America to Dr.
Elliott Coues, United States army; collections of American and foreign
reptiles to Professor E. D. Cope, Philadelphia; fungi from the Indian
territory to the Rev. M. A. Curtis, Hillsborough, N. C.; unfigured species
of North American birds to D. G. Elliott, New York; diatomaceous
earths and deep-sea soundings to Arthur M. Edwards, New York; Lep-
idoptera from various North American localities to W. H. Edwards,
Coalburg, Va.; seeds of Boehmeria, received from the Department of
Agriculture, to Dr. Earl Flint, Nicaragua; plants collected in EKeuador
by the expedition under Professor Orton to Dr. Asa Gray, Cambridge ;
miscellaneous specimens of North American insects to Professor T. Glover,
Department of Agriculture, Washington; general collection of birds of
Costa Rica and Yucatan to Georze N. Lawrence, New York; American
Unionidie to Isaac Lea, Philadelphia; series of North American salaman-
ders to St. George Miv art, London; American Diptera to Baron R.
Ostensacken, New York; eiteprdeuiers of Ecuador and Yucatan to Tryon
Reakirt, Philadelphia; “ nts collected in Alaska by various expedi-
tions to Dr. J. T. Rothrock, McVeytown, Pa.; birds of Buenos Ayres,
received from W. H. Hudson, and a series of small American owls, to
Dr. P. L. Sclater and Osbert Salvin, London; miscellaneous collections of
American Orthoptera to S. H. Scudder, Boston; collections of American
Hemiptera to P. R. Uhler, Baltimore; American myriapods and spiders
to Dr. H. C. Wood, Philadelphia; human crania from northwestern
America and the ancient mounds of Kentucky, also collections from the
ancient shell-heaps of Massachusetts and New Brunswick, to Dr. Jefireys
Wyman, Cambridge.

Few persons are aware of the seat extent to which this Smithsonian
material has been used by American and foreign naturalists, or the
number of new facts and new species which have been contributed to
natural history through its means. A complete bibliography of the titles
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

(oh)

of the various books and memoirs containing in part or entire the
esults of these examinations, with lists of the new species, would form
alarge volume. Among the published results of the examination of the
materials furnished by the Institution during the last year may be
mentioned the following:

A monograph of the Alcadz, by Dr. E. Coues, in the Proceedings of
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences; various herpetological
papers in the same Proceedings, by Professor E. D. Cope; portions
of various fasciculi of his work on North American birds, by D.
G. Elliott; monograph of the North American Lepidoptera, by li
H. Edwards; catalogue of the birds of Costa Rica in the museu
of the Smithsonian Institution, and some special papers in the annals of
the New York Lyceum of Natural History and the Proceedings of the
Philadelphia Academy, by George N. Lawrence; paper on the Unionidee
in Proceedings Philadelphia Academy, by Isaac Lea; monograph of the
North American Diptera, Part IV, by Baron R. Ostensacken, pub-
lished by the Smithsonian Institution; catalogue of Alaskan plants in
the Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1867, by Dr. J. T. Rothrock;
list of birds sent from Buenos Ayres to the Smithsonian Institution, and
other papers, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, by
Dr. P. L. Selater and O. Salvin; ‘on crania of Tschuktchi and Esquimaux
tribes,” by Professor J. Wyman, in the Proceedings of the Boston Society
of Natural History. In all these cases full credit is given for the aid
which has been afforded by the Institution.

The Secretary, during the past year, has given a large amount of
thought and labor to investigations relative to light and sound as aids
to navigation, in connection with his duty as one of the members of the
United States Light-house Board. He has also, in his connection with
ae National Academy of Sciences, devoted nearly all his time, for the

pace of two months, to investigations relative to the proper form of
Hotei for gauging the quantity of proof spirits produced by distilleries,
in order to determine the amount of tax to be paid to the government.

Professor Baird has continued his investigations relative to the birds
of North America, especially those of Alaska, the result of which has been
the addition of fifteen species to those previously known to exist in this
country. He has also edited a report by Dr. Cooper on the birds of
California, for the geological survey of that State under Professor J. D.
Whitney, and is now engaged in the preparation of a new manual of the
ornithology of the United States. This work, which is to be illustrated
by numerous engravings on wood, will be published by Little & Brown,

Hxchanges.—The cost of the international system of exchanges in the
transportation of books and specimens is constantly increasing, and
now forms no inconSsiderable part of the annual expenditures. Were it
not for the liberality of various companies, we should be unable to eon-

tinue the system, at least in its present dimensions; and we embrace
this occasion again to express acknowledgments for the efficient aid
thus rendered to the cause of science and to the promotion of kindly
feeling between the United States and the other nations of the world.
The following are the companies to which special thanks are due,
namely, The Pacific Mail Steamship Company, North German Lloyd.
Hamburg American Steamship Company, General Transatlantic Steam-
ship Company, Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Inman Steamship
Company, Cunard Steamship Company, California and Mexico Steam-
ship Company, and Panama Railroad Company. To this list must be
added several other lines which have granted similar facilities during
the past year, namely, the Mexican Steamship Company, Union Pacific
Railroad, United States and Brazil Steamship Company, North German
Lloyd, (Baltimore line,) and the Atlantic Mail Steamship Company.

Acknowledgments are also due for favors rendered in connection with
foreign exchanges to E. J. Davison, esq., Argentine consul; José I. San-
chez, esq., consul of Venezuela; Seftor b. Blanco, consul-general of Gua-
temala; L. H. J. d’Aguiar, consul-general of Brazil; R. C. Burlage, con-
sul-general of Netherlands; Hon. EH. Gutierez, minister from Costa Rica;
to the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions; Real Socie-
dad Economica, Havana; Board of Foreign Missions, New York; Amer-
ican Colonization Society, Washington; Society of Geography and Sta-
tistics, Mexico; University of Chili; Bataviaasche Genootschap, Java;
Institute of History, Geography, and Ethnology, of Rio Janeiro.

The Institution frequently receives applications from foreign govern-
ments and societies for official publications of the States or general gov-
ernment relative to certain branches of political economy, statistics,
education, &e. During the last year a request of this kind was received
from the Belgian government, desiring us to procure all the publications
of the States in regard to public schools. In answer to our circular ask-
ing for these documents, a large and valuable collection was received,
for which the thanks of the Institution were returned to the following
persons, namely: to A. Rogers, second auditor of Virginia; T. Jordan,
secretary of state, Pennsylvania; 8S. C. Jackson, assistant secretary
Board of Educa-ion, Massachusetts; J. A. Morris, school cominissioner,
Ohio; N. Bateman, superintendent education, Illinois; C. J. Hoadley,
state librarian, Connecticut; F. Rodman, secretary of state, Missouri;
Rt. A. Barker, secretary of state, Kansas; Ed. Wright, secretary of
state, lowa; C. W. Wright, secretary of state, Delaware; J. E. Tenney,
secretary of state, Michigan; and the secretary of state, Wisconsin.

Another application of a similar character was received from the gov-
ernment of Norway for the publications of the United States relative to
military affairs, which, on being referred to the heads of departments
and bureaus, secured a large number of the desired publications. <Ac-
knowledgments for these favors are due to General E. D. Townsend,
adjutant general; General A. A. Humphreys, chief engineer United
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

States army; Surgeon General Barnes; Paymaster General Brice; Gen-
eral Dyer, chief of ordnance; Commodore Jenkins, chief of bureau of
ordnance and hydrography, Navy Department; General Myer, chief
signal officer.

For official co-operation with the Institution in its various plans for
the promotion of knowledge and important assistance rendered, besides
the foregoing, we may mention Hon. William H. Seward, Secretary of
State; Hon. Hugh McCuiloch, Secretary of the Treasury ; Hon. Horace
Capron, Commissioner of Agriculture; General Meigs, Quartermaster
General; Mr. Spofford, librarian of Congress; Professor J. H. C. Coffin,
superintendent Nautical Almanac; and Commodore Sands, of the Na-
tional Observatory.

In 1867 a proposition was made to the Institution by the librarian of
Congress relative to establishing and conducting a system of exchange
of official documents between the government of the United States and
those of other nations. In accordance with this, a circular was addressed
to the different governinents having relations with the United States for
the purpose ef ascertaining their views as to such an exchange. In
every case the proposition was regarded with favor, and at the ensuing
session of Congress an act was passed directing that 50 full sets of all
documents published at the Government Printing Office should be set
apart for the purpose in question, and appropriating a sufficient sum
to defray the necessary expenses. Unfortunately, however, Congress
neglected to direct the public printer to strike off the necessary copies
for this purpose, in addition to the regular number previously required
for the use of the government, and it was not until recently that the
necessary legislation was procured to remedy this omission. As soon
as the printing of the documents of the present session of Congress is
completed, the exchange proposed will be initiated. In anticipation of
the receipt of the annual supply of the documents of our government,
several large packages containing documents of foreign countries have
been already received.

At the commencement of the system of international exchanges, great
delay and considerable expense were incurred in conseczence of custom-
house requirements and tariff duties, but as the importance of the system
became more evident, and the reputation of the Institution better estab-
lished, one government after another consented to the entrance of pack-
ages without examination and free of all restrictions, until at the present
time there is no exception to this practice.

The first effort towards the establishment of this desirable condition
of free intercourse was made in 1852, through Sir Henry Bulwer, then
minister from Great Britain to the United States. Through his recom-
mendations the British authorities at first permitted the entry of such
‘books from the Institution intended as presents to learned bodies as
might be recommended for that privilege by the Royal Society of London.
This, though,an important concession, was still attended with consider-

.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

able delay, and on further solicitation the rule was so relaxed that at
present the Smithsonian agent finds no difiiculty in obtaining the pas-
sage of the packages at a mere nominal charge through the custom-house.
With the precedent of the British authorities the Institution experienced
no difficulty in making a satisfactory arrangement with the French offii-
cers of customs. “Packages for Germany and central Europe, addressed
to our agent, Dr. Flugel, are entered at Bremen or Hamburg, then
transferred to the Leipsie custom-house, from which they are released
on the formal application of the agent to the authorities of the Zoi-
verein. Parcels for Belgium and Holland are entered at Amsterdam,
which is a free port. Those for Italy are entered at Genoa, which is
also a port of free entry. In all cases of transmission of packages an
invoice of the contents is sent to the agent, which serves as the basis of
his application for remission of duties and charges.

Library. —The works which have been received from all parts of the
world in return for the Smithsonian publications, after being recorded
at the Institution, have been transferred to the national library in ae-
cordance with the rules given in former reports. They are there under
the care of an accomplished librarian and a corps of able assistants,
accessible to all persons who desire to consult them, during every week-
day of the whole year, with the exception of a month in summer. The
transfer of the library of the Institution still continues to be approved
by ali who have attentively considered the advantages it affords to the
Institution, the government and the public. It has relieved the Smith-
son fund of a serious burden in the cost of binding and cataloguing the
books, in the pay of a librarian and his assistants, and in the expense
of the maintenance of a separate establishment. It has enriched the
library of Congress with a class of valuable works which could scarcely
be procured by purchase, and it has facilitated the use of the books by
collecting them in one locality, under the same system, readily accessible
to the public. Some special works required for immediate use are still
occasionally purchased, and besides these a working library is retained
at the Institution, principally, however, of duplicate volumes, while such
series as are needed for special investigation are brought back for the
purpose. The care of these and the cost of those purchased make up
the small expenditure given in the report of the executive committee
under the head of the library.

The Library of Congress, or, as we think it should now be denomina-
ted, the ‘“ National Library,” contains about 180,000 volumes, exclusive
of unbound pamphlets and periodicals, and is rapidly increasing, the
accessions during the year ending December 1, 1868, according to the
report of Mr. Spofford, the librarian, amounting to 8,498. This library
is emphatically a library of progress, for while it continues to increase
by purchase in its own series of standard works of all times, its addi-
tions, through the contributions to it of the Institution, include the trans-
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

actions of the principal learned societies of the world, or the works
which mark more definitely than any other publications the actual
advance of the age in higher civilization.

An idea has, in some cases, been entertained abroad that the Institu-
tion, since the transfer of the library, no longer desires to receive books,
but measures have been taken tocounteract thisimpression and toassure
Societies and other correspondents that no change in this respect has
taken place in the policy of the Institution, and that books on all subjects
are still desired both for its own collections and for presentation to other
establishments in this country.

The following is a statement of the books, maps, and charts received
by exchange in 1868:

But, perhaps one of the most interesting contributions is a work rela-
tive to history and philology published in folio parts of fac-similes of the
national manuscripts of England, presented by Right Honorable the Sec-
retary of Statefor War. These fac-similesare executed with minute pre-

cision as to accuracy, by the photozincographic process, under the direc-
- tion of Colonel H. James of the ordnance department. Theseriesincludes
documents belonging to each reign, from William the Conqueror to
Queen Anne, arranged chronologically so as to illustrate the changes
in the handwriting, and the language of different periods of English
history. A translation is given of each document into modern English,
together with a short account of its history. The first volume extends
from William the Conqueror to Henry V{I, and includes autographs of
each sovereign, beginning with that of Richard I, and of many princes,
prelates and nobles, whose names have become famous in history.
Among the number are a series during the reign of Richard IL, and
several from the king himself.

The second part is made up of fac-similes selected from the public
records of the reigns of Henry VIIi and Edward VI. Among them
are holograph letters, and autographs of Henry VIII, Queen Catharine
of Aragon, Cardinal Wolsey, the Emperor Charles V, Anne Boleyn,
Archbishop Cranmer, Queen Catharine Parr, Ann of Cleves, &c. The
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

third part contains fac-similes of state papers, royal letters, and other
documents, both public and private, belonging to the reigns of Queen
Mary and Queen Elizabeth. Among those of the former are auto-
graphs of her Majesty and of her cousin and rival, Lady Jane Grey, holo-
graphs and autographs of King Henry the Second, of France, the King of
Hungary Cosmo de Medici, the Lady Elizabeth of England, Thomas Gres-
ham, Roger Ascham, &c. Among those of the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
besides those from herself, are letters of Mary Queen of Scots and her
husband Bothwell, and of the most distinguished nobles of Scotland;
of John Knox, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, James VI of Scotland, Sir
Francis Vere, sir Walter Raleigh, and other celebrated personages. The
exaggerated terms of courtesy which were in use among eminent per-
sonages at that period are illustrated by several examples in this vol-
ume. The publication of the fac-similes of these valuable and interest-
ing documents is to be continued, and we learn from the preface that
similar fac-similes of the national manuscripts of Scotland have been
undertaken, and those of Ireland recommended.

It may be proper to recall the fact that the library of Smithson, or so
much of if as was received by the Institution, with his personai effects,
was not destroyed by the fire, andhas been placed in a suitable case for
permanent preservation.

Mr. Theodore Gill, who was formerly assistant in the library of th:
Institution, has been appointed one of the principal assistants in the
national library, but he still continues his investigations in natural his-
tory at the Institution, and acts as the intermediate agent between the
two establishments. Miss Jane Turner, who vindicates by her accuracy
and efiiciency the propriety of employing her sex in some of the depart-
ments of government, still continues to register the books as they are
received through the extended system of international exchange.

Gallery of Aré.—The original act of Congress organizing the Institu-
tion directed that, in addition to the support of a museum, library, &e.,
provision should also be made for a gallery of art. In compliance with
this direction a commencement was made by the purchase of a series of
valuable engravings, illustrative of the progress of the art from the
earliest times, and also a series of Indian portraits was’ received on
deposit. With these and a number of plaster casts of distinguished
individuals, principally donations, a collection of articles was formed to
which the name of a gallery of art was given. ‘The Indian portraits,
which had been deposited by the author, Mr. Stanley, together with a
series of ‘portraits also of Indians, belonging to the government, were
destroyed by the fire. Fortunately the engravings, with few exceptions,
were saved, and are now deposited with the books in the library of Con-
gress. It was evident, however, that the proportion of the Smithson
fund which could be devoted to the purchase of specimens of art worthy
of preservation in a public gallery at the seat of government was far too
smail to do anything of importance in this line. It was therefore with

»
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

gratification that the Regents learned that a citizen of Washington,
William W. Corcoran, esq., with an enlightened liberality, commensurate
only with his means, had resolved to found an institution exclusively
devoted toart. This design, which would otherwise have long since been
fully carried out, was interr Hted by the war. The large building which
Mr. Corcoran had erected for the purpose was found necessary by the
government for the use of the Quartermaster General and is still retained
in possession of that officer. As soon as possession of it is restored to
Mr. Corcoran, which it is believed will be done in the course of the
present year, ae together with a liberal endowment equal in amount to
the original fund of Smithson, will be given in charge to a board of trus-
tees, who will immediately proceed to carry out the views of the generous
founder. In accordance with the policy which the Institution has
adopted in regard to the library of Congress, the Agricultural Depart-
ment, and the Army Medical Museum, it will probably be considered
advisable to enter also into friendly co-operation with this new establish-
ment, and instead of attempting to support a separate gallery of art to
turn over to it the articles which have already been collected, and thereby
increase the space in the Smithsonian building for articles of natural
history and ethnology.

Meteorology.—It was stated in the last report that with the dimin-
ished expenditure on the building, and the larger amount which could
be appropriated to the active operations of the Institution, the reduction
and discussion of the meteorological material which had been collected
for 20 years would be resumed, and that we had commenced upon the
rain-fall of the North American continent. Observations relative to this
subject from upwards of 1,200 localities were placed in the hands of
the computers. This work fie been completed under the direction of
Mr. Charles A. Schott, and will be pat to press as soon as the illustra-
tions are engraved. We are confident it will be considered by all who
are competent to properly estimate its value, as one of the most import-
ant additions to the climatology of North America and the agricultural
interests of the community which has ever been made. The same com-
puters are now engaged upon the large amount of material relative to
temperature, but the reduction and discussion of these will require more
time than that which has been devoted to the rain-fall. It is estimated,
however, that at the rate at which the work is now going on, it will be
completed in the course of the next year.

The diseussion of ali the observations relative to the winds has been
resumed under the direction of Professor J. H. Coflin, of Lafayette Col-
lege, Pennsylvania, and will be prosecuted with as ae" rapidity as the
nature of the subject, and the assistance afforded him, will permit.

All the more important meteorological observations which have been
collected at the Institution during the last 20 years, are now in process
of reduction, and when completed and the rabalié published, we think
AG REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

they will fully justify the expenditure of the Smithson fund which has
been devoted to this subject.

The importance of a thorough knowledge of the climate of a country
in relation to the well-being of the inhabitants can scarcely be over-
estimated. The character of the animal and vegetable productions of
any part of the world mainly depends on the climate, and if, as in
geological periods, we, suppose this in any case to undergo a change,
we are certain, from the operation of general laws, that the fauna and
flora of the region will undergo a corresponding change. It is true that
civilized man has in a degree, through science, the power of resisting
the influence of climate to which his race has not been long subjected,
yet if sufficient time be allowed for the weather to produce its effect,
marked peculiarities of physical constitution and even mental charac-
teristics will eventually be produced, though these will be somewhat
modified by the artificial conditions which have been introduced. Even
a difference in the degree of moisture of the atmosphere has been shown
by a critical observer to induce marked changes in the manners and
customs of Europeans in their emigration to this country.

The average temperature and moisture of each region, as well as the
periodical fluctuations to which these elements are subjected, are essen-
tial data on which to base the choice of special objects of culture and to
estimate the probable results as to success or failure in a given number
of years. It is a fact to which the statesman and the intelligent
farmer cannot be teo much alive, that the great material prosperity of
this country in the past has been due to the large quantity of fertilizing
material originally in the soil, and that this has been exhausted to a far
greater extent than is generally supposed. It is well known that the
same soil which in the eastern States originally yielded 30, and in some
cases 40 or 50 bushels of wheat to an acre, now produces but eight or
ten. From a late estimate by the Commissioner of Agriculture the
average yield of the whole United States is less than 12 bushels, while
that of Great Britain is 28; the great excess of the latter over the for-
mer must be mainly due to the improved methods of agriculture. Indeed
with the large extent of virgin soil in this country, producing sponta-
neously rich harvests, with the expenditure of a minimum amount of
labor, we have had comparatively little necessity to adopt methods of
scientific agriculture, but we have now arrived at the condition in which
every year a new demand will be made for the application of knowledge
and skill of this kind, and for all the light which can be shed upon the
subject by meteorology, chemistry, physiology, and other branches of
science.

It will be remembered that the meteorological system of the Smith-
sonian Institution wasin a considerable degree interrupted, particularly in
the southern States, on account of the late war. We have, however, during
the past year succeeded in obtaining a number of copies of registers
which were continued with but little interruption through the whole
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

period of the disturbance, and have also supplied a deficiency occasioned
by the loss of the registers of 1860 in the fire which occurred at the
Institution in 1865. For the purpose of exhibiting the extent of the
material in possession of the Institution, and to give credit to the faith-
ful and persevering observers who have so long gratuitously furnished
contributions to this branch of science, there is given in the appendix to
this report a full list of all the observers and of all the stations where
records have been made from the beginning of the year 1849 to the end
of 1868. The whole number of observers at present reporting to the Insti-
tution is about 400; of these 74 are furnished with full sets of instru-
ments. The number of observers under the direction of the army is
upwards of 100, of whom 50 are supplied with standard barometers and
other compared instruments. With this combined system, interspersed
with full sets of standard instruments, trustworthy data is obtained for
determining the general climatology of the country. It is true that
many of the instruments in use are not as perfect as could be desired,
yet they serve to indicate differences in the elements, and thus afford
the data for tracing the progress, as it were, ef waves of atmospheric
pressure, and also of waves of changes in atmospheric temperature.

Anticipating the important benefits which may result to our system
of meteorological observations, particularly to those which relate to the
prediction of storms on the Atlantic coast, we look forward with much
interest to the completion of the Pacific railway. A well equipped
physical observatory placed at the highest point of the road, namely,
‘“ Sherman’s station,” is very desirable, and we think it probable that
assistance from the railway company may be obtained to establish and
support an observatory of this character.

During the past year a large number of rain gauges of a simple form,
such as were mentioned in the last report, have been procured and dis-
tributed to observers in various parts of the country. This gauge con-
sists of a hollow cylinder of tinned iron 24 inches in diameter, and 12
inches in height, coated inside and out with varnish to prevent rusting.
The depth of rain is measured by inserting a graduated scale into the
gauge, and noting the height to which it has been wetted, in tenths and
parts of tenths of an inch. The quantity of water in a fall of snow is
measured by melting a column equal in diameter to that of the gauge.
This is obtained by pressing the gauge, mouth downward, through the
snow to the ground and isolating the contents by passing under the
mouth of the gauge a thin plate of metal. <A rain gauge of this form,
after an experience of many years~is found to give the most satisfactory
results when used by ordinary observers.

The diseussion of all the material which we have collected in regard
to rain-fall, has served to point out the parts of the country in which the
registration is most deficient, and exertions have especially been made
to obtain observations from the great plains of the west and at the base
of the Rocky mountains. The great current of the return trade wind,
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which continually flows through the higher regions of the atmosphere

over the whole United States and which at intervals reaches the

suriace of the earth, deposits its moisture, obtained from the Pacific,.
on the Sierra Nevada and other chains of the Rocky Mountain system,

and thus gives rise to the arid basins and woodless plains of the western

portion of our domain. A part, however, of thisregion may be rendered

arable by means of irrigation, or, in other words, a portion of the pre-

cipitated vapor may be, as it were, reclaimed for agricultural purposes, °
by artificial means; and in determining the available resources of the

ecuntry itis important that the amount of water, either in the hquid

state or in the form of snow, which is precipitated in the mountains,

should at least be approximately determined, and hence we have directed

special inquiries to this point, supplying rain-gauges in all cases of
explorations and giving definite directions as to ascertaining the depth

of snow, the gauging of streams, &c.

Much has been written on the subject of reclaiming arid wastes by
planting trees, but the facts which have been collected in regard to this
matter are frequently misinterpreted, and the result of much research
in reference to it misapplied. It should be recollected that trees cannot
grow without moisture and that they have no power within themselves
to create this essential element of their existence. It is true that in
some cases where moisture exists but is retained in an aeriform condi-
tion by the radiating character of the soil, or carried away by the wind, it
may be precipitated and rendered applicable to the uses of agriculture
by the judicious planting of trees; while it is equally true that there are
other localities in which the necessary water for vegetation can never be
procured by artificial means. The necessary data for the investigation of
this question in relation to the western portion of the great valley of
the Mississippi can only be obtained by extensive series of observations
on the relative humidity and the direction of the moisture-bearing winds
of different portions of the country.

During the past year a self-registering barometrical apparatus, in-
vented by Professor George W. Hough, of the Dudley Observatory, has
been erected in the Institution, but owing to the position in which it was
first placed the series of records has not been continuous, though from
the records which have been obtained it would appear that the instru- »
ment is capable of giving valuable results. This instrument consists of
an iron tube in the form of a siphon closed at the upper end and filled
with mereury, and two cylinders or drums moved by clock work, to
the surface of which is attached the paper receiving the register. On
the surface of the mercury, in the shorter leg of the siphon, is an ivory ©
float, fastened by a fine thread to one end of a lever, the other end of
which terminates between two points connecting the opposite poles of a
galvanic battery. As soon as the mercury begins to rise and while
it continues to ascend, the end of the lever is*pressed against the upper
point, thus completing the cireuit of an electro-magnet, which unlocks
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

the printing part of the machine, and a record is made in the form
of an ascending curve on the drums and on a slip of paper in figures,
‘on the principle of the printing telegraph. When the mercury falls the
motion of the pencil is reversed by bringing into operation a second
electro-magnet by which is traced a descending curve. Two drums are
used, one giving the curve for two weeks and the other the same more
developed for two days, the one serving as a check on the other. An
interesting series of observations furnished from the United States engi-
neer depot at Willett’s Pomt, New York, by General Abbot, exhibits
the almost perfect parallelism of two curves for nearly a month, one
by an apparatus similar to this at Albany and the other at Wiilett’s
Point, from observations with an ordinary standard barometer, the
distance between these places being upwards ‘of a hundred and fifty
miles. The parallelism of these curves exhibits not only the probable
accuracy of the self-recording apparatus, but also the extent in a north
and south direction of a wave of atmospheric pressure. The great
improvement in meteorological data must depend in future on the intro-
duction of self-recording instruments, especially at important points.
Beside the contributions made directly from the ordinary observa-
tions of the Institution, the following is an acccount of a memoir belong-
ing to meteorology, previously noticed under the head of publications:
On the evening of July 20, 1860, a meteoric fire-ball passed over the
northern parts of the United States and the adjacent parts of Canada,
of so extraordinary a brillianey as to attract the attention of numerous
observers along its entire visible track of nearly 1,300 miles. The phe-
nomenon was of so interesting a character that the Smithsonian Insti-
tution made exertions to collect observations in regard to it from its
meteorological observers and other correspondents, which, together
with accounts from newspapers and other sources, were placed in the
hands of Professor Coffin, of Lafayette College, for the determination of
the orbit of the meteor. In order to correct the observations, in cases
where instruments could not be obtained, Professor Coffin directed that
estimates should be made of the position of the meteor, by means of an
extemporaneous quadrant, consisting of a graduated paper attached to
a board, from an angle of which a small plumb-line was suepended.
The edge of this instrument being directed to the place in the heavens
where the meteor was seen at its greatest elevation, gave approximately
the angle of altitude. The meteor was first observed moving from a
point over the western shore of Lake Michigan, though it is not improb-
able that it became luminous when it was somewhat fiirther west, as the
sky in that region was obscured by clouds, and it was not until it had
reached a point 150 miles further east that the first reliable observation
of its position was made; from this point many eyes watched its course,
until it disappeared out at sea, in a southeasterly direction, beyond the
island of Nantucket. Whatever may have been the orbit of this meteor
before ra became visible, it is obvious that the portion of the path that
Ss
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

was subject to observation was so near the earth as to be controlled
almost entirely by its attraction, and not sensibly perturbed by other
bodies. The orbit therefore ascertained, is not the path of the meteor in
space, but that having the center of the earth in one of its foci. Pro-
fessor Coffin proceeded with the data at his command, to determine the
path upon the assumption that the earth was a sphere 7,912 miles in
diameter, not taking into account its spheroidal form, nor the difference
between the true and the apparent zenith. In prosecuting the investi-
gations, the method adopted was as follows: The parallax and position
of the meteor were obtained by combining in pairs observations taken
on or near the same vertical plane. Unfortunately, the number of pairs
of reliable observations was too few for much accuracy. An approxi-
mate orbit was, however, determined, from which azimuths and alti-
tudes. were deduced, and these compared with those given by the obser-
vations. The form of the orbit was then altered so as to diminish the
discrepancies, and it was not until over fifty changes of this kind had
been made that the final result was attained. The velocity per second,
relative to the earth’s center, which best corresponded with observations,
was nine and three-fourths miles. The first approximate orbit satisfied
the most reliable observations west of about longitude 76° or 77°; but
further east the discrepancies were so great that they could be recon-
ciled only by a sudden change in the curvature of the path, one at the
point just named, and another two or three degrees further east. In the
vicinity of the former of these points a remarkable rupture in the body
of the meteor was observed, where it separated into two parts that
appeared nearly of equal size, thus affording a rational explanation of
the change in the elements. That a change should take place at a point
of explosion was not difficult to understand, but the fact that the
meteor descended quite rapidly towards the earth, until it reached the
meridian of 74°, and afterwards rose, was difficult to comprehend. The
most plausible explanation was suggested by Professor Lyman, viz:
that the change in direction was due to the increased resistance of the
air as the meteor descended into a denser portion. An attempt was
made to deduce the quantity of the change from this hypothesis; the
result, however, was not entirely satisfactory, an empirical change
being assumed in the path near longitude 74°. An orbit was computed,
the path of the meteor divided itself into three sections, the first and
last of indefinite length, through only a small portion of which the
meteor was visible; the other an intermediate portion of 160 miles in
Jength, where it was most brilliant. The most important omission in
the caleulation of the elements of this meteor, according to Professor
Coftin himself, was that of the spheroidal form of the earth, which be-
came of importance in comparison with the small height of the meteor;
but with the hope that the subject might hereafter receive at the hands
ot others a more thorough discussion, he concluded to slightly modify
the elements, so as to afford an unperturbed orbit that would differ so

little from the disturbed one, that the azimuths and the altitudes which
he had already computed for the one might serve for the other. The
velocity of the meteor, when nearest the earth, was 9.76 miles per second ;
its least distance from the surface of the earth was 39.19 miles, at about
the middle of New York.

Correspondence.—ASs the collaborators of the Institution generally
reside at a distance, the business with them is principally carried on
by mail. The same is also the case in regard to all the exchanges, and
consequently the record of nearly all the transactions of the Institution
is contained in the correspondence. besides those relating to official
business, hundreds of letters are received during the year, containing
inquiries relative to the various subjects on which the writers desire
information. If these cannot be immediately answered without much
research, they are referred to collaborators who are experts in the vari-
ous branches of knowledge, and who can readily supply information in
regard to subjects within the range of their special studies.

In addition to the foregoing it may also be mentioned that there are
four hundred meteorological observers, from each of whom several letters
are received annually. The correspondence of the Institution being of
such importance, it has been considered necessary to adopt a system in
regard to it, which consists in registering in a book prepared for the
purpose, every letter received which pertains to the business of the In-
stitution. The mail is opened every morning by an assistant, who
assigns to each letter a number, gives a synopsis of its contents, and
notes to whom it is referred for answer. The letters are afterwards
bound in volumes and indexed. Press copies are kept of all the answers.
An idea may be formed of the amount of labor bestowed upon this
branch of operations, when it is mentioned that the number of letters
registered during 1868 was 5,141. This does not include letters
acknowledging the receipt of donations from the Institution, which
would swell the number of actual receipts by the mail to upwards of
10,000.

During the past year references of inquiries above referred to have
been made to the following gentlemen: Dr. Torrey, of New York; Pro-
fessors Gray and Wyman, of Cambridge; Dr. Leidy and Mr. Isaac Lea,
of Philadelphia; Professors Whitney, Brush, and Newton, of New
Haven; Drs. Woodward, Otis and Craig, of the Surgeon General’s
office; Prof. Schaeffer and Mr. W. B. Taylor, of the Patent Office; Pro-
fessor S. Newcomb, of the Naval Observatory; and Mr. George Gibbs
and Mr. J. H. Lane, of Washington.

Grounds.—The Smithsonian building, as is well known to the visitors of
Washington, stands in the midst of a park, adorned with a collection
of the principal ornamental trees which are susceptible of cultivation in
this climate. This forms part of a reservation of the government
denominated the “Mali,” extending from the Capitol to the Potomac,
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which, in accordance with the design of Mr. Downing, was to be entirely
devoted to an extensive park.

This plan has been revived by the present Commissioner of Public
Buildings, General Michler, of the United States army, who strongly
advocates an appropriation for carrying it into execution. On the
grounds adjoining the Institution to the west, also a part of the pro-
posed park, within the last year a spacious building has been erected
for the uses of the Department of Agriculture, and designs have been
made under the present Commissioner, General Capron, for the estab-
lishment of an extensive arboretum. With the renewed interest which
has been excited on this subject, and the rapid advance of the city in
wealth and population, we doubt not the original plan will soon be real-
ized. In the mean time, however, we would call attention to the fact
that many of the valuable trees originally planted by Downing are being
injured by the luxuriant growth and consequent crowding of those too
near each other. Though the visitors to the Institution—and the numn-
ber of these is by no means small in the course of a year, and from every
part of the world—are delighted with the general appearance of the
grounds and the picturesque effect of the building, yet their sense of
propriety is shocked and their olfactory nerves outraged, in approaching
the-building from the city, by having to cross that most disgusting ob-
ject known as the “canal,” though for years it has done no service of
any value in that capacity. It is, in fact, a Stygian pool, from which
are constantly ascending in bubbles, as from a caldron, mephitic vapors.
That part of it which bounds the Smithsonian grounds and those of
the Agricultural Department, on the north, consists of a basin 150 feet
wide, extending from Seventh street to Fourteenth street. Into this is
poured most of the excrementitious matter of the city, which is suifered
to decompose into offensive gases, and exposes with each ebb of the
tide a mass of the most offensive matter conceivable. This subject, at
the last session of the Board of Regents, was referred to the executive
committee, who have given it special attention, and prepared a report
which will be presented to the Board at the present session, and should
be ordered to be published.*

The only reason assigned for suffering this nuisance to remain so long
unabated is the difficulty of settling upon a plan of remedying the
evil, but surely this need not longer to stand in the way since there is
engineering ability enough in the country to solve problems of greater
intricacy than the one under consideration. The only effectual cure of
the evil is, in my opinion, to fill up the present basin, and construct
a covered sewer of sufficient capacity to receive that part of the
drainage of the city which cannot be turned in other directions. A
wide street with concave surface to discharge very rare freshets,
would afford a series of building lots of sufficient value to pay the

this volume.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

expense of the improvement, while the value of property south of the
canal would be greatly enhanced.

Before concluding this sketch of the history of the operations of the
Institution for the year 1868, it becomes my duty to mention the death
of Mr. William B. Randolph, who for many years has acted as book-
keeper for the Institution, posting and auditing its accounts, and who
for GO years had been connected with the Treasury Department of the
government. He was a gentleman of extensive information, a graduate
of Princeton’ College, of inflexible integrity, esteemed and beloved by
all who knew him. His life was prolonged with vigor of intellect be-
yond the usual term of earthly existence, and he died on the 15th of
May last at the age of ‘81.

Since the death of Mr. Randolph the entire charge of the accounts
has been given to the chief clerk, Mr. William J. Rhees, by whom they
are prepared for quarterly examination by General Delafield and Dr.
Parker, of the executive committee.

Tn conclusion, from all the facts which have been given in this report,
as well as in previous ones, we think it may reasonably be claimed that
the administration of the Smithson fund, on the whole, has been success-
ful. Though the Institution has been subjected to loss by casualties,
and has been exposed to adverse conditions during the most troublous
times in the history of the nation, yet it has continued noiselessly and
unostentatiously to extend its influence and benefits not only to every
part of this country, but to all portions of the civilized world. This
success, if mainly due to the definiteness of conception in the original
plan, must, in no small degree, be attributed to the fact that the Chief
Justice of the United States is the head of the Board of Regents, whose
permanence of office, aside from other considerations, could not fail to
secure, as has been conspicuously evinced in the caseof both Judge Taney
and Judge Chase, a warm and intelligent interest in the affairs of the
Institution. Neither is it possible to overlook, in this connection, the
favorable influence of the policy which, from the first, has invested in a
single officer, the Secretary, the executive charge of the operations, thus
confiding to him their conduct and rendering him responsible for their
results, without in a single case interfering with his acts. Moreover,
simple justice would require that due credit should be given to the capa-
ble and zealous assistants whom the Secretary has associated with him-
self in carrying on the multifarious and arduous duties of his office.

Respectfully submitted.

Inaddition to this amount the Institution received from, and accounted for, to the
Department of the Interior, the sum of $5,116 31, appropriated by Congress for
the preservation and care of the property in the museum collected by govern-
ment exploring expeditions. Of this sum $4,000 was the appropriation for the
year 1868-69, and $1,116 31 the balance of the previous year’s appropriation.

The State of Virginia paid during the year 2 per cent. on its old bonded
debt for the first six months, leaving 1 per eent. still due for that period,
claimed to be payable by Western Virginia, as a just proportion of the original
State debt. On its new bonds, issued for coupon interest past due, nothing has
been paid. ‘The State proposes to sell its interest in certain canals, rail and
other roads, to liquidate this and other indebtedness, and favorable results may
for the future be anticipated from this investment.

110 REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

EXAMINATION OF ACCOUNTS.

The committee has examined 576 receipted vouchers for payments made dur-
ing the four quarters of the year 1868. Evidence of the receipt of materials
and property, and of services rendered, and payment to the claimants or legal
representatives, was found for the whole amount expended during the year. An
examination of the quarterly accounts current, bank-book, check-book, and
ledger showed that the payments were made as required by the regulations pre-
seribed by the regents; and the cash balances stated in the accounts current were
in the authorized depository after the payment of all the quarterly accounts
charged in the abstracts of expenditures.

In the receipts for the year 1868, the sum of $5,116 31 is noted as hay-
ing been received through the Department of the Interior, appropriated by Con-
gress for the preservation and charge of its property in the museum collected by
government exploring expeditions. The expenditure of this sam was made and
accounted for in strict conformity with the financial regulations prescribed by
the regents.

ESTIMATED RECEIPTS FOR 1869.

Interest on the Smithsonian fund in the treasury of the United
States $650,000, payable 1st July, 1869, and 1st January,

APPROPRIATIONS FOR 1869.

It is proposed to apply the income of the year as follows:

Woreoneral expenses: ets eres eit etait ae $15, 000° 00

Leaving from the yearly income a balance of. 8, 567 00

$53, 567 00

Tt will thus be seen that the Institution has paid all its indebtedness ; provided
all needful accommodation in the gradual reconstruction of parts of its building
destroyed by fire; published large editions of annual contributions to science;
accumulated a saving from its income of 1868 of $10,352 74, and an estimated
saving of $8,567 from its income of 1869—making the sum of $18,919 74 as
an available fund in January, 1870, to enable the Institution to conduct its opera:
tions on a cash basis from the beginning of the year, and to continue and extend
its investigations in the various branches of physical science; at the same time
supplying apparatus for warming the various apartments in the building.

tain what measures are proposed to be taken by the city authorities of Wash-
ington in regard to the canal, so far as concerns the Smithsonian Institution,
has examined the snbject and now report, for the information of the Regents:

That the Washington city canal has been constructed under the authority
granted by the folowing laws:

On the Ist of May, 1802 , Congress passed an act incorporating the Wash-
ington Canal Company, to raise $80,000, and construct a canal from the Potomac
to the Eastern Branch, to admit boats drawing three feet water to pass through
the whole extent of said canal, with the right to charge and collect tolls and -
wharfage. If not so completed within five years, it was to revert to the United
States.

This act seems to have expired by the failure of the company to execute the

work, and on the 16th of February, 1809, Congress incorporated other parties,
to raise $100,000, with the same title, to construct the canal through part of the
city of Washington, as laid down on a plan of the city defining its limits, to
acdimit of boats drawing three feet water to pass through it; and if, at any time,
the canal shall become obstructed so thut boats and scows drawing three feet
water cannot pass through from the Potomac to the Eastern Branch, the com-
pany shall not collect tolls or wharfage, and all the rights under this act shall
cease, unless the canal is completed within seven years from the passage of the
act.

Before the expiration of this seven years, and on the 6th of May, 1812, ia
egress authorized money to be raised by lottery for completing the canal, render-
ing it navigable, and draining the marshes and low grounds contiguous thereto,
and on the 7th of May, 1822, authority was ox ranted by Congress to the city of
Washington to contract with the canal company to change the direction of parts
of the canal, to drain and dry the low grounds on the borders of Tiber creek.

On the 20th of May, 1826, the canal company was authorized to increase the
width of the canal along the present boundary of the Smithsonian grounds, and
elsewhere, to 150 feet in width, and also to construct basins; and within five
years shall construct the canal through its whole length to contain water at least
one foot in depth at ordinary low water.

On the 2d of May, 1831, the canal company sold all its interest to the city of
Washington, which was conveyed by a deed dated the 23d of July, 1831; and
on the 31st of May, 1832, Congress confirmed this sale, and enacted that all the
right, title, mterest, property, and estate of the Washington Canal Company are
vested in the mayor, aldermen, and common council, for the aforesaid use, with
the proviso, that the canal shall be finished and completed, of the breadth and
depth and in the manner and within the time hereinafter prescribed, and not
otherwise. The act then prescribes the width at different parts, and then that
the canal, throughout its whole length and breadth aforesaid, and the basins, shall
have a depth of at least four feet water at all times, and that the whole shall
be walled on its sides, and made suitable for steam-vessels, to be used therein,
and finished by the 1st of March, 1833, and in default, all the rights and _privi-
leges granted by this act shall cease and determine. No tolls or “wharfage were
allowed to be charged or collected whenever the canal was so out of repair as to
impede the free navigation with four feet water. By the same act all the right,
title, property, interest, and estate of the United States, of, in, and to that part
of the public reservation designated as the mall, was vested in the city corpora-
tion, in fee, to be sold, and the moneys applied to the construction of the canal.
A street of 80 feet wide on the south side, in addition to the 40 feet landing,

was also authorized, and previous specified acts, conflicting with this act, were
repealed.

On the 2d of March, 1833, Congress appropriated $150,000 to aid in fulfilling
the objects and requirements of the act of 31st of M: ay, 1832, provided the city

corporation relinquished all title to the land vested in it by the 8th section of

2
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 113

the act, and all the rights and privileges granted by the 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th,
13th, and 14th sections of said act.

On the 3d of March, 1849, Congress appropriated $20,000 for clearing out
and deepening that portion of the canal which passes through and along the
public grounds, provided the city expends a like sum in cleaning out and deep-
ening the other portions.

On the 3d of March, 1851, Congress appropriated $20,000 for completing,
clearing out, and repairing that portion of the canal which passes through and
along the public grounds, provided the city expends a like sum in clearing and
repairing the other portions.

On the 23d of February, 1865, Congress authorized the city corporation te
lay taxes * * to introduce the necessary sewerage and drainage facilities under
or upon the whole-or any portion of any avenue, street, or alley.

On the 16th of February, 1866, a bill was reported in the House of Repre-
sentatives creating a sewerage commission, with power to improve and regulate
the Washington city canal, as may be necessary; and on the 6th of March an
amendment to the bill of the 16th of February, 1866, was reported, limiting
the number of commissioners to three, giving them power to adopt and lay down
a complete and uniform plan of sewerage, as it may deem necessary and most
advisable, with reference to the public health and general interest; the city to
raise $150,000 to execute the work by contract, and the United States not to be
responsible for an amount exceeding one-half the outlay or expenses incurred
under this act. There was no further action on this bill or amendment.

About the same time, to wit, on the 7th of March, 1866, the Senate of the
United States passed a resolution requiring the appointment of a board of United
States engineers, to report a plan for improving the canal and sewerage of the
city. This board, on the 2d of April, 1866, made a partial report for the tem-
porary improvement of the canal, which the city authorities adopted, and appro-
priated $75,000 to carry into effect.

Such is all the legislation on this subject the committee has been enabled to
find, up to the end of the year 1867; from which it appears the United States
granted to a company the right to construct the canal in question, on certain
conditions and for specified uses; that this company sold all its rights to the
corporation of the city of Washington, and the United States approved the sale
and transfer, granted additional rights, and exacted additional facilities, limiting
the uses to navigation by steamers, barges, and scows over the whole surface and
length of the canal and basins, from the Potomac to the Eastern Branch. No
authority is found for converting the canal into a sewer or recipient for the sewer-
age matter of the city, nor can the committee find that the purposes of the <anal
for navigation have ever been carried into full effect. It would further appear
that the city can make no sale, transfer, disposition, or change of its rights, inter-
ests in and uses of the canal, without the authority of the United States, and it
may well be questioned whether or not the city has lost all its rights in the pre-
mises, by failing to make the canal navigable, and using it as a sewer and
reservoir for the excreta from a large proportion of the population of the city.

PROPOSED ACTION.

On the 6th April, 1868, a bill was reported in the board of aldermen, grant-
ing to certain citizens all the rights now held by the city in the canal for a term
of 30 years. It proposes to grant, for the sole use and benefit of the parties
named, all the rights, &c., of the city to the canal, and all the rights conferred by
the United States, under the act of the 31st May, 1833. The corporators are to
narrow the existing canal, and deepen it to one foot at low water, and finish
the same in June, 1873, and may collect tolls and dockage. 'The company shall
extend all sewers now leading into said canal to the outer surface of the canal

wall, and at no time interfere with the canal being used for sewerage. It was
provided that this transfer, with the proposed modifications, be submitted to Con-
gress for approval.

The mayor of the city, in a communication to Congress of the 23d April, 1866,
states that the condition of the canal is such as to require an abatement of the
nuisance caused by deposits from the sewers, while the bill now under considera-
tion of the council greatly increases and prolones this nuisance.

The committee concurs in the opinion of the mayor of the city that the pro-
posed grant of the canal to a private corporation would be a grievous injury to
the inhabitants of the city, and would defeat the much-desired object of both
Congress and the community of securing the health of the city.

The committee learns from the mayor that it is proposed to extend the Ches-
apeake and Ohio canal from Georgetown, through the city, to the deep water
along the Eastern Branch, with the view of establishing a shipping port for large
vessels, and depot for the Cumberland coal, thus sharing with Georgetown and
Alexandria the profits of this branch ef industry. The project is one to which
the committee should present no objection, provided it does not interfere with the
general health of the city, or works ey for promoting the health of the
inhabitants.

The committee considers that a canal for such a purpose, or any other, through
this city, should not lock down to tide-water until it has passed entirely throngh
the city, and recommends that neither the existing canal, the proposed modifica-
tions, nor transfer of the existing canal to any private corporation, be approved
by Congress unless the subject of public health and sewerage be first provided
for, and insured against all hindrance and interruption for all time to come, and
that no sewage matter be allowed to enter any open canal whatever, within the
limits of the District of Columbia.

INFLUENCE OF THE CANAL ON THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION.

At the present time the Washington city canal is an extended cesspool, the
bottom of which is below the level of low w ater, the surface varying with the
slow and gradual rise and fall of the tide, without any current to act upon the
bottom or of sufficient velocity to move insoluble ponderous matter that is
received into it.

The sewage from the water-closets, kitchens, laundries, stables, cattle-pens, and
street outters is now received into this immense trap, there to remain, without
power of any kind to carry it into the river or other place to protect the city
against its pernicious effects and influences. The existing sewers now enter this
reservoir so much below low water as to have caused one-half their entire height
to be closed by deposit, and as a consequence filling every such sewer with
poisonous matter into the city to the level of the intersection of the water in the
canal with the inclined plane of the bottom of the sewer. This mass cannot be
removed by any means now available. On the supposition that the canal re-
ceives the sewage from a population of only 30,000 of the inhabitants of the
city, the est timated annual cubic mass that is on into the canal is not less
than 300,000 cubic feet, or at the rate of 10 cubic feet per head per annum of
solid and fluid human excrement.

This fecal matter has for some years past been accumulating in the canal, in
proportion to the extent and number of sewers constructed from time to time,
without any power of removal of the solid parts, and only a slight power for
moving the fluid portions backwards and forwards, there bemg no continuous

current to force even the fluid and soluble parts into the Potomac or Eastern
Branch.

From the experience of other cities, and the investigations of chemists and

engineers, we learn that open sewers, as the canal in this city, evolve gases very

e-

SSS
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 115

prejudicial to health. Observation has shown that the death rate is much greater
among the population along these open sewers than in streets removed but a
short distance from them.

The signs of animal life visible to the naked eye in small rivers after receiv-
ing sewage matter consists of myriads of minute worms, characteristic of all
sewage Ww rater, and may be regarded as the last rémains of animal life which can
survive in such a locality; and even these die off in summer.

The putrescence of the organic liquids and deposits in the open sewers and
bottoms and beds of streams in all weathers, and the evolution of noxious gases
therefrom, lead to the sensible contamination of the surrounding atmosphere, and
consequently decreases the purity and healthiness of the air, and the discharge

of sewage matter into streams and small rivers pollutes the w ater by the mis sture
of much organic matter in a state of active putrescence.

Analysis gives 15 to 80 grains per gallon of suspended matter, and from 35
to 76 grains “of dissolved matter, of the sew age of large towns. Of the former
about 35 per centum is organic, ’and of the. latter about 28 per centum. The
organic matter consists of vegetable and animal fibre with a soluble extractive in
a high state of decomposition. The organic constituents give off such an abund-
ance of foul gases that they are a constant source of annoyance. ‘These gases
consist of about 73 per centum of light carburetted hydrogen, 16 per centum of

carbonic acid, 10 of nitrogen, and traces of sulphnretted hydrogen, ammonia, and
a putrid, organic vapor that is in the highest degree offensive.

Every gallon of sewage will discharge from 14 to 14 cubic inches of this gas
per hour, and the fermentation continues for weeks. » Whenever this gas escapes
from privies, cesspools, or sewers, it causes disease, and finally sets up a putrid
form of fever which is exceedingly fatal.

Every effort is made elsewhere to prevent the diffusion of these feetid gases
into the houses and public ways, while in Washington we promote the evil to an
incalculable extent and danger in that vast fermenting vat, the city canal.

It fullows that the sewage é of lar ee populous cities and towns can only be con-
ducted into large rivers near the sea, that they may not contaminate the atmo-
sphere, and should never be discharged into fresh-water streans used or required
for man or beast.

If conducted into closed harbors or bays, they create such a deadly pollution
as soon to lead to the most alarming consequences.

The magnitude of this evil, and the suddenness with which it may come upon
us in its most fatal form, are exemplified by the experience of London. ‘The
committee asks attention thereto, as fully illustrating the evil we have to com-
bat in this city, and the necessity of prompt attention :

“On the introduction of the water-closet system in London, and the abolition
of cesspools, with the increase of gas-works, the Thames began to give indica-
tions of receiving a larger quantity of decomposing matter than it could purify
or get rid of by the tide movement. In 1856 it became apparent in the summer
mouths that the river emitted a disagreeable stench. ‘This became still more
evident in 1857, and was obviously dependent on the increased attention paid to
the removal of all refuse from houses by the aid of drainage. In 1858 the stench
appeared with increased intensity, and especially in the neighborhood of the new
houses of parliament. very one felt it was necessary to meet so gigantic an
evil. The river had become one elongated cesspool, and the effect upon the
teeming population of its banks might be in a short time of the most disastrous
Kind, In 1858 an act was passed for preventing, as far as practical, the sewage
from passing into the Thames within the metropolis, g giving authority to expend
three millions of pounds sterling to effect the object.”

‘This experience may very properly be received as a trathful representation
of what is being done in this city, and the consequences.

The specific gravity of sewage gases is lighter than that of the atmosphere
116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Generated in large volumes in the canal, and lower end of as well as in the sewers,
it ascends the sewers to escape at every higher level, and creates the pestilential
influences heretofore referred to. We had some experience in this city in 1857,
causing death and prolonged disease among the inmates of one of our hotels.
Thus the deleterious eases ascend and the poisonous liquids descend, making the
ventilation of the sewers as important as conveying away the solids and liquids
to insure the health of the city. No system of cleansing sewers by manual labor
is justifiable.

Laborers employed in this disgusting business in the culverts for fluid excre-
ments, as in the Paris system, are subject to two terrible diseases, both due to
the deadly effluvium of feeces, the one caused by ammonia gas, creating distem-
pers of the nose and eyes, and the second by sulphuretted hydrogen, nitrogen,
and hydrosulphuretted ammonia, causing sudden death. In the sewers for fluid
and solid excrementa, as in London and Washington city, the effects are even
more fatal. In the report of the engineer relating to the London sewers, it is .
stated that he witnessed several cases of death, and others in which men were
taken out insensible, after only a few seconds’ exposure. In Warwick street,
Fimlico, five men were killed, in 1852, by this gaseous sewage. Three of them
had gone into the sewer early in the morning, and, not returning for breakfast,
alarm was felt for their safety. A surgeon entered the sewer and was killed on
the spot. A young policeman followed and was struck dead in a few minutes.
On examination after death it was shown that he could not have made more than
two respirations before death after entermg the sewer. On making an opening
from the street into the sewers to get the bodies of these men, the ¢ gases as they
escaped were set fire to by a match and burnt with a yellow flame, rising twenty
feet. Within three months of the date of the engineer's S report three more lives
were lost near Whitechapel by breathing sewage gases as it escaped from an
opening made into another sewer.

It is now a well-established fact, deduced from the medical statistics of the
English armies in India, and of our army in its marches during ‘the past two
years, that cholera is propagated mainly by atmospheres contamigated and poi-
soned by the excrement of cholera patients.

In this city the canal would be the reservoir for such matter, first to be con-
taminated by travellers from infected districts, sojourning temporarily at the hotels,
all the sewers from which now or are hereafter to empty in the canal.

The committee is of the opinion that the canal, as it now éxists, is a great cause
for creating and propagating disease, and should at the earliest possible moment
be filled up and discontinued for use as a sewer and reservoir for excrement and
waste waters of kitchens, water- closets, laundries, and other sources of contam-
inating matter, and is also of the opinion that, if the proposition of granting the
city rivhts to this canal be confirmed, the evils herein set forth cannot be efli-
ciently corrected by any means left in the power of the public authorities with-
out incurring a heavy expenditure to purchase rights and property now proposed
to be given away.

It is proper to state that part of this system of sewage, and, it is believed, the
commencement of making the canal a reservoir and cesspool, was made under
appropriations of Congress for building sewers from the Capitol and the execu-
tive buildings from lifteenth to Seventeenth streets.

REMEDIES FOR THE EXISTING EVILS.

The committee has pointed out the probable evil consequences of our existing
system of sewage, as a result of using the canal as a cesspool and reservoir for
the fecal matter, from whence it cannot be removed by any existing means. It
has also shown that the air and water from the canal are contaminated bj y the
sewerage of the city, and produce fatal diseases tending to virulent epidemics,
and that the canal is neither fit for navigation, sewerage, or drainage, in its pre-

sent form and dimensions. 4
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 117

Tt remains for the committee to propose some method by which these evils may
be remedied.

The old, thickly populated cities and towns of Europe have been compelled,
for self- preservation, to expend millions of money, and adopted a variety of sys-
tems to remove excrement from the limits of their abodes.

The systems last adopted for Paris and London, at an immense outlay, give in
general the main reliable features of the most acceptable plans.

In Paris metallic vessels for every family are so arranged that the solid feeces
are separated from the urine. The latter passes into street sewers of large
dimensions, conducting it, with the surface drainage from the streets, into the
Seine, and the solids are removed from the dwellings by scavengers with carts,
and conveyed some miles from Paris, where it is converted into dry poudrette and
sold for manure. No less than 278,000 cubic metres of these solid excrementa
were collected from the tenements in Paris and removed to La Vilette for con-
version into fertilizing matters in one year.

In London a system commenced in 1859 of sewers at different levels, running
parallel with the Thames, receives all the house and street drainage, both solid
and fluid, and conducts the same, miles below the city, into the river, to find its
way to the sea. ‘These longitudinal sewers drain the entire city surface of 117
square miles, and are together 82 miles in length. Their fall does not exceed
two feet per mile, and are carried over rivers, railways, roads, and streets, by
wrought-iron aqueducts. Of the surface thus drained 254 square miles are below
the level of high water % and drained by a sewer of 10 miles in length. A part
of the sewerage, or 145 miles of this surface, has to be pumped up 174 feet to
discharge it into the T hames; and at what is called the Abbey Mills Siution: the
whole mass of sewage is pumped up 36 feet to the level of the outfall sewer.
This system is peculiar i in having culverts parallel with the river, to receive the
sewage at high levels as far as practicable, and not allow it to fall into basins or
valleys below the river surface, and by steam pumps raising all the sewage mat-
ter from surfaces below the river level into the main drains leading to the river.

Another system is advocated, by which all the excrementa is received from the
water-closets, both solid and fluid, into small boxes in the streets, from whence
it is drawn by pneumatic portable engines into tight barrels, and thence in its
liquid state distributed in drills underground by ploughs, as a manure for the sur-
rounding country. It is claimed to be the only effectual way of removing this
offensive matter and preserving the whole of it for manuring the soil.

With subsoil ploughing, rotation of cr ops, lime, marl, green sand, barn-yard
manure, guano, and other fertilizers, the use of sewage matter is not likely to be
acceptable to our agriculturists, and no demand will probably exist sufficient to
absorb the quantities that by this system must be daily disposed of in summer
and winter.

The committee has come to the conclusion that we must construct the sewers
of the city of Washington on levels above high water, and conduct them to dis-
charge their contents in the strong ebb current of the Potomac river at high water,
that the entire accumnlation of twelve hours may have six hours of ebb tide to
carry it towards the Chesapeake, which, with the annual freshets and constant
flow of the Potomac, will always carry it beyond the distance it can be brought
back by the flood.

It is indispensable the ontlet of these main sewers should be below the Long
bridge, (and as distant as practi¢able,) otherwise all the solid matter would accu-
mulate on the shoals between this bridge and Georgetown, and in time create as
great an evil as the canal.

To effect this object all the main sewers must be carried across the site of the
present canal on closed aqueducts or causeways, at the most advantageous levels
above high water, and thence under the grounds south of the canal, to suitable
places on 1 the bank of the riv er, where closed and covered reservoirs may be con

structed to retain the sewage until the ebb-tide makes, when gates or valves will
be opened to allow it to escape into the river, under the water surface, using the
waters of Rock creek and the Tiber to cleanse them.

The present canal should then cease to be used for any other purpose than as
an escape for the waters of the Tiber during extraordinary freshets, and for such
surface drainage as cannot be carried across it into the sewers leading to the
Potomac, and to this end must be filled up and reduced in size and form.to an
arched culvert. The proposed canal for commercial purposes, with an outlet in
the Eastern Branch, should, in like manner, be carried over the valley of the
present canal on an aqueduct or causeway, and then through or along the high
ground to the Eastern Branch.

We have found that the canal is not useful for navigation. A railroad over
the same ground, extended along the river front, with turn-outs and sidings to

warehouses and depots, free to every owner of a car, would better subserve the
publie welfare, it is believed, than any water transportation that can be derived
from the existing or other canal. Such a road for heavy traffic, with a well-
constructed paved street for light vehicles, and a paved walk along the south side,
adjacent to the public reservations, connecting the Capitol, botanic ¢ garden, Smith-
sonian, agricultural, and W ashington monument grounds with the “erounds about
the President’s house, would insure greater he alth, promote public convenience,
and greatly enhance the value of property now separated from the settled portions
of the city by an impassable barrier. These are additional considerations for
using the site of the existing canal as a covered drain or culvert for surface water
only. :

The committee has confined itself to pointing out the evil effects of the exist-
ing sewerage, the necessity for immediate correction, and a general plan therefor,
leavi ing it for the talent and genius of the most experienced engineers to select
the most advantageous sites “for the outlets of the sewers, at the most distant
points from dense population, and mature the details of a project for carrying this
system into effect.

MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

By M. FLOURENS.

Translated for the Smithsonian Institution by C. A. Alexander.*

When a nation loses one of those men whose sole name would suffice for its
own glory and that of an epoch, the grief which it feels ds so profound that
voices are raised on all sides to deplore the common calamity. ‘There isa general

5
emulation to pour forth the public regret at their tomb; a universal impulse to

5
make known all that can be learned respecting lives so illustrious and so honorable
to humanity.

So it should have been, and so in effect it has been in regard to M. Cuvier. Men
of science, men of letters, whole Academies, indeed, have already published
accounts of his life and person, and it would be too late to-day for the Academy
of Sciences to say anything new of the great man whom it has lost. But, among
the labors on which rests his renown, there are such as pertain more specially
to this Academy, and the study of which is far from being exhausted. I allude to
the progress which the natural sciences owe to M. Cuvier, a progress which has
renovated all those sciences, and which has so greatly extended them that it has
in reality extended, through them, the reach of the human mind and the domain
of genius.

In M.C uvier, therefore, I consider here only the savant, and even in the savant
shall, above all, consider the naturalist. Fontenelle said, in his account of
Leibnitz, that he had been obliged, in some sort, to divide and decompose that
ereat man; and that quite the contrar y of antiquity, which had made one Hercules
out of many, he had made of Leibnitz alone, many savants. So it is necessary
to decompose M. Cuvier, if we would at all measure his genius; this great intel-
lect which, like that of Leibnitz, “ conducted all the sciences abreast,” ‘and which,
not restricting itself to the sciences, diffused its hght on the hig hest institutions
of the state, requires, in order to be properly comprehended, as many separate
discussions as it has manifested different capacities. I repeat, therefore, that I
here consider in M. Cuvier only the naturalist; but even so, my task ‘will be
immense, and, in venturing to approach it, I need all the indulgence of those
to whom I address myself.

The history of M. Cuvier, if we recall all that the nataral sciences owe to
him, is scarcely less in fact than the history of those sciences in the earlier part
of the nineteenth century. ‘The eighteenth had already communicated to them
a rapid movement in advance. ‘T'wo individuals, Linneus and Buffon, had espe-
cially co-operated in producing this mov ement: and although endowed other-
wise with very different qualities, it is to be remarked, nevertheless, that it was
from the same cause that both had failed in their aim. ‘Those phenomena, in
effect, those beings, those facts, which the comprehensive genius of Linneus
souk 't to distinguish and to cl: assify ; ; those facts which the. soaring genius of
Buffon sought to combine and to explain, were not yet sufliciently known in
their intimate nature to supply either their true classification or their real explana-
tion.

The primary merit of M. Cuvier, and it was by this merit that he communi-
cated from the first a new life to the natural sciences, was the distinet perception

that the classification as well as explanation of facts could be founded only on
their inmost nature thoroughly understood. In a word, and taking into view
only the natural history of animals, that branch of natural history in general
which M. Cuvier has most directly elucidated by his labors, it is evident that
what had been wanting to Linnzeus and to Buffon, whether for the classification
of animals or for the proper explanation of their phenomena, was the adequate
knowledge of their,internal structure or organization; and it is not less evident
that the laws of all classification, as of the whole natural philosophy of these
beings, could spring only from the laws of that organization itself.

It will presently be seen that it was by the assiduous study of these fruitful
laws that M. Cuvier renovated in succession zoology and comparative anatomy ;
that he renovated them one by means of the other; and that he founded on both
the science of fossil animals—a science altogether new, wholly due to his genius,
and which has thrown light in its turn on the science of the earth itself. But
before we come to these last and astonishing results, the fruits of somany grand
conceptions and so many unexpected discoveries, let us first see what he has
done in particular for each of the sciences just mentioned, in order that we may
afterward be better able to comprehend and embrace in a general view what he
has done for all. I commence with zoology.

Linnzeus, who of all the naturalists of the eighteenth century had exerted the
most general influence on the human mind, particularly in point of method,
divided the animal kingdom into six classes: quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, fishes,
insects, and worms. In this Linnzeus committed a first general error, for in
placing in the same line these six primitive divisions, he assumed that an equal
interval separated them one from another; than which nothing could be less
exact. On the other hand, almost all these classes, especially the last, at one
time separate animals the most nearly related, at another unite those which are
most incongruous. In a word, classification, which has no other end but to
mark the true relations of beings, in this instance almost everywhere severed
those relations; and that instrument of method which only serves the under-
standing in so far as it conveys just ideas of things, communicated to it, nearly
throughout, only false ideas.

This whole classification of Linneeus was, therefore, to be recast, and nearly
the entire framework of the science to be reconstructed. Now, to attain this
end, it was first necessary to found the classification on organization, for it is
organization alone which gives the true relations; in other terms, it was neces-
sary to found zoology on anatomy ;.it was next necessary to introduce into the
method itself views more just and elevated than had been previously applied.
It was, in effect, these elevated views as regards method, these profound studies
on organization, which shone forth in the first labors of M. Cuvier: potent
resources, by means of which he succeeded in effecting successively the reform
of all the branches of zoology, one after the other, and in finally renovating in
its whole extent that vast and grand science.

I have said that it was chiefly in the class vermes of Linneus that disorder
and confusion prevailed. He had thrown into it all animals with white blood—
that is to say, more than half the animal kingdom. It was in the first of his
memoirs, published in 1795, that M. Cuvier pointed out the great difference of
the beings till then confounded under this vague name of white-blooded animals,
and that he separated them with precision from one another, first into three great
classes: Mollusks, which, like the poulp, the cuttle-fish, the oyster, have a heart,
a complete vascular system, and respire by means of branchiz or gills; désects,
which have, in place of a heart, only a simple dorsal vessel, and respire by
tracheze ; and, lastly, zoophytes—animals whose structure is so simple as to have
gained them this name, signifying animal plants, and which have neither heart,
nor vessels, nor distinet organ of respiration. By subsequently forming three -
other classes—vermes, crustacea, echinodermata—all the animals with white
MEMOIR OF CUVIER. “Wa

blood are found to be distributed into six classes: mollusks, crustaceans, insects,
worms. echinoderms, and zoophiytes.

Everything was new in this distribution ; but everything was at the same time
so evident that it was generally adopted, and thenceforward the animal kingdom
assumed a new face. “Moreover, the precision of the characters on which each
of these classes was founded, the perfect conformity of the beings which were
assembled under each of them, could not but prove convincing to naturalists;
and what doubtless appeared to them not less worthy of admiration than these
direct and immediate results, was the sudden heht w vhich thereby broke on the
highest points of the science—the grand ideas on the subordination of the organs
and on the office of. this subordination in their employment as characters—those
great laws of the animal organization thus and so early apprehended: that all
animals with white blood which have a heart have also branchie or a cireum-
scribed respiratory organ; that all those which have no heart have only a
trachea; that wherever the heart and the branchiz exist, the liver exists; that
wherever they are wanting the liver is wanting.*

Assuredly, no one had as yet thrown a glance so comprehensive, so penetrat-
ing on the general Jaws of the organization of animals, and it was easy to fore-
see that if he should pursue the investigation of those laws with anything like
the same continuity, Cuvier, whose first views had imparted to science so brilliant
an impulse, would not be ‘long in extending its boundaries in every direction.
He has often recalled since, and even in his last works , this first memoir, from
which, in truth, date the germs both of the grand renovation which he effected
in zoolosy and of the oreater part of his most fandamental ideas in comparative
anatomy.

Never, indeed, had the domain of a science been so rapidly angmented. With
the exception of Aristotle, whose philosophic genius had neglected no part of
the animal kingdom, scarcely had any one studied, at any epoch, more than the
vertebrate animals alone, at least in a general and thoroug h manner. "The ani-
mals with white blood, or, as M. Lamarck has since called them, the animals with-
out vertebre, formed in some sort a new animal kingdom, almost unknown to
naturalists, and of which M. Cuvier had at once revealed to them as well the
different plans of structure as the particular laws to which each of these plans
is subjected. All these animals—so numerous, so varied in their forms, and the
knowledge of which has since so greatly extended the basis of general phiysi-
ology and natural philosophy—were then of scarcely any account to the physi-
ologist and the philosopher; and even long after these ereat labors of M. Cuvier
of which I speak, how many systems have we not seen which, pretending to
embrace under one sole point of view the entire animal kingdom, have embraced
in reality only the vertebrata? So vast was the new route which he had traced
for naturalists, and so difficult was it found to follow him therein, on account of
its very vastness. :

-In this first memoir, then, M. Cuvier had succeeded in finally establishing the
true division of animals with white blood. Ina second, taking up specially
one of their classes, that of the mollusks, he laid the foundations of his great
work on those animals—a labor which oceupied him for so many years, and
which has produced an assemblage of results the most surprising, perhaps, and
at least the most essentially new of all modern zoology, as of all modern com-
parative anatomy.

Till then there had been no example of an anatomy so exact and bearing on
so great a number of fine and delicate parts. Daubenton, that model of precis-
ion and ex xactness, had scarcely described with equal det ail more than the skele-
ton and the viscera of quadrupeds; here there was the same attention and a

124 MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

still more eminent degree of sagacity of observation transferred to all the parta
of the animal—to its muscles, its vessels, its nerves, its organs of sense. Swam-
merdam, and Pallas,* w ho had embraced all the parts of the animal in their anatom-
izations, had confined these to certain species; in another genus Lyonnet had
confined himself to a single one; in the case of Cuvier there was an entire class
of animals, and of all animals the class least known, of which almost all the
species were described and all the details, even the most delicate and obscure,
of their structure were brought to light and developed.

The mollusks have all a heart, as already said; some, however, have but a
single one, like the oyster and snail; others have two; others again, like the
poulp and cuttle-fish, have as many ‘as three distinct hearts. And yet it was
with these animals whose organization is so rich, which have a brain, nerves,
organs of sense and of secretion, that it had been the custom to confound others,
Ww hich, like the zoophytes and polypes, for example, have for their whole organi-
zation only an almost homogeneous pulp.

The experiments s of ‘Trembley have rendered famous the polypus of fresh
water, that animal which puts forth buds like a plant, and each part of which,
separated from the others, forms a new and complete individual. The whole
structure of this singular zoophyte reduces itself to a sac—that is to say, to a
mouth and stomach. M. Cuvier has made known another zoophyte,t whose
structure presents something still more surprising, for it has not even a mouth;
it is nourished by means of ramified suckers, like plants, and its internal cavity
serves by turns as a stomac -h and sort of heart, for vessels enter it which con-
duct to it the nutritive juices, and other vessels issue from it which convey these
juices to the members.

One of the most curious problems of the physiology of white-blooded animals
which has been resolved by M. Cuvier is that of the nutrition of insects. Insects,
as has been already said, have, in place of a heart, only a simple dorsal vessel ;
and, moreover, this dorsal vessel has no branch, no ramification, no particular
vessel which either enters or issues from it. This was already known through
the celebrated researches of Malpighi, Swammerdam, and Lyonnet. But M.
Cuvier goes much further; he examines, one after the other, all the parts of the
bodies of insects, and by this detailed examination he shows that no sanguineous
vessel, or, what amounts to the same thing, no circulation, exists in these ani-

mais. How, then, is their nutrition effected?

M. Cuvier begins by remarking that the final object of the circulation is to
conduct the blood to the air. Hence all animals which have a heart have a cir-
cumscribed respiratory organ, whether langs or branchie, and the blood returned
from the members to the heart is invariably constrained to traverse this organ,
in order to be there subjected to the action of the air before returning to the
members. But in insects the apparatus of respiration is wholly different. It is
no longer a circumscribed organ which receives the air; it is an immense nam-
ber of Blache vessels, called tr ache, which convey it ie all parts of the body,
and which thus conduct it even to the nuiritive fluid itself, which continually
bathes those parts. In a word, while in other animals it is the nutritive fluid
which by means of the circulation goes in search of the air, the phenomenon is
reversed in insects, and it is the air, on the contrary, which goes to seek the
nutritive fluid, and thereby renders all circulation useless.t

Another discovery of M. Cuvier, not less important, is that of the circulatory
apparatus of certain worms, such as the earth-worm and leech, which had until
then been confounded with those zoophytes of a structure inconparably more

simple, which live only in the interior of other animals.* By a remarkable sin-
gularity the blood of these worms, with a circulatory apparatus,t is red: a new
circumstance to show how inexact and vague was the denomination of animals
with white blood, given till then, in a general manner, to animals without
vertebree.

By means of these admirable investigations M. Cuvier, it will be seen, had
fixed the limits of the class of mollusks: he had determined that of the vermes
with red blood, he had completely separated both from that of the zoophytes ;
finally, he had marked the true place of the zoophytes themselves, thenceforth
consi ioned to the extreme limit of the animal kingdom. But a principle which
he had employed in all these researches must needs lead him still further. This
principle is that of the subordination of organs or of characters.

Method should not limit itself, in effect, to representing indistinctly the rela-
tions of structure ; it ought to mark, besides, the particular order of theserelations
and the relative importance of each, and it is precisely to this end that the prin-
ciple of the subordination of organs serves. Bernard and Laurent de Jussieu
had already applied this principle, as fruitful as it is infallible, to botany, but
the zoologists had not yet ventured to make the application of it to their own
science, determined, no doubt, by the great number and complication of the
organs ’ which constitute the animal body, and which, for the most part, are

W anting in vegetables.

The principle of subordination of organs could only be introduced into zoology
when preceded by anatomy. The first step to be taken was to know the organs ;
the determination of their relative importance could be only the second. ‘These
two steps accomplished, there remained only to found the characters on the
organs, and to subordinate these characters one to the other, as the organs are
subordinated among themselves. Such was properly the object. of the Animal
Kingdom distr ibuted according to its organization, (Legne Animal, de.,) that
great work in which the new zoological doctrine of the illustrious author is dis-
play ed as at length reproduced in all its entireness and co-ordinated in all its
parts.

Dating from this work the art of methods has assumed a new face. Linneus,
as is well known, had seen in this art only a means of distinguishing species.
M. Cuvier was the first who undertook to make method the very instrument of
the generalization of facts. Method, viewed in itself, is for him only the sub-
ordination of propositions, of truths, of facts, one to another, according to the
order of their generality. Applied to the animal world, it is the subordination
of groups among the -mselves, according to the relative imports uce of the organs
which constitute the distinctive characters of those groups. Now, the most
important organs are also those which involve the most general resemblances.
Whence it follows that in founding the inferior groups ou the subordinate organs,
and the superior groups on the dominating organs, the superior groups will
always necessarily comprise the inferior, or, in ‘other terms, it will always be
practicable to pass from one to the other by. progressive propositions, becoming
more and more general in proportion as we ascend from the inferior groups
towards the superior.

Meihod, therefore, properly considered, i is but the generalized expression of
science ; it is science itself, but science reduced to its most simple CXPressions ;
it is still more: this linking together of facts according to their analogies, this
linking together of analogies according to their degree of comprehensiveness, is
not limited to the representation of known relations zl it brings to light amultitude
of new relations, contained one in another; it disengages them from one another
it thus gives new forces to the understanding for perceiving and discovering 5 it
creates for the mind new processes of logic.

126 MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

Hitherto M. Cuvier had seen, in each of these grand classes of invertebrate
animals, mollusks, insects and zoophytes, only a group like each of the four
classes of vertebrate animals, geadrupeds, birds, reptiles and fishes. It was
because he had as yet considered only the organs of circulation.

In considering the nervous syStem, which is a much more important organ, he

saw that each of the three great classes of animals without vertebree corresponded
or Was equivalent not to such or such a class of vertebrate animals taken sepa-
rately, but to all these vertebrate animals taken together. A first form of the
rervous system unites all these vertebrate animals in a single group; a second
form unites all the mollusks; a third unites the insects to the worms with red
blood, and both to the crustacea, constituting the group of articulata; a fourth
form, finally, unites all the zoophytes. There are thus four plans, four types in
the animal king dom, four embranchements, as M. Cuvier calls them ; or, in plainer
terms, and divested of everything vague, there ave four gener ral forms of the
nervous system in animals.

Tn the sciences of observation and experiment the supreme art of genius is to
transform questions from simple questions of reasoning into questions of fact.
For more than a century the question had been debated whether, in animals,
there was but one plan of or ganization, or whether there were several. This
question, couched till then in terms so vague, is transformed by M. Cuvier into
this other question, positive and to the point, namely, how many distinct forms
are there of the nervous system in animals? Now, as I have just said, there are
four—one for the vertebrata, one for the mollusca, one for the articulata, one for
the Zoophyta ; these four plans or types comprising the whole animal kingdom.

Such is the light thrown upon the animal kingdom by the great work ‘under
consideration that, guided by this, the mind is enabled precisely to appreliend
the different orders of relation which connect animals with one another; the
relations cf conformity (d’ensemble) which constitute the unity, the character of
the kingdom; tbe relations more or less general which constitute the unity of
the embranchements, of the classes ; the more particular relations which constitute
the unity of the orders, of the genera.

Nevertheless, this work of so vast a scope, of such immense detail, was not
yet what M. Cuvier would have wished. 1t is the property of genius always to
sce something beyond and better than all that it has done. And, indeed, though
all the species s had been reviewed in this great work, the greater part of them
had been searvely more than indicated ; it was, therefore, only an abridged, not
a complete system of animals. Now, the idea of a complete system of animals,

o system in which all the species should be not only indicated, distinguished,
elesied. but represented and described in their whole structure, was one of
those with which M. Cuvier was most constantly occupied. Hence, eae
was this great treatise on the animal kingdom terminated, when another we
already commenced, and on a plan not less vast. I mean the “ Natural aeons
of Fishes,” (Histcire naturelle des poissons,) the first volume of which appeared
in 1828.

After having effected, in the earlier of these two works, the complete reform
of the system “of animals, what he lad wished in the secoud was to show, by a
detailed and thorough e <position of all the known species of a class, what could be
done for all other species and all other classes. With this view he had chosen
the class of fishes as being, among all those of the vertebrata, the most numerous,
the Jeast known, and that most enriched by the recent discoveries of travellers.
The latest xuthors of note in ichthyology, ‘Bloch and Lacépede, were scarcely
acquainted with so many species of fish as 1,400; in the work of M. Cavier
the number of species would have amounted to more than 5,000; the entire
work would have ineluded not tess than 20 volumes, al! the materials were placed
in order, and the nine volames which made their appearance in less than six
years fully attest the wonderful rapidity with which it was intended that this
yast undertaking should proceed ;
MEMOIR OF CUVIER. 127

Pressed by want of time I must deny myself all details on this work, so
astonishing for its extent, and yet still more astonishing for that profound art in
the formation of genera and families, of which the ¢ author seems to have delighted
to unveil the most hidden secrets, and for that science of characters which no
one ever possessed in an equal degree, results of experience and fruits of a
genius arrived at its full maturity.*

Such is the assemblage of great labors by which M. Cuvier has renovated
zoology ; but a reform still more important, and of which that is in rez ality but
the consequence, is what he had already effected, or was at the same time effecting
in comparative anatomy. It is impossible to speak of the progress which this
science owed to the researches of M. Cuvier without profound respect and even
grateful acknowledgment; he himself regarded this branch of investigation, and
with justice, as the ; ‘regulator of all those which relate to organized beings, and
death surprised him still meditating that great work which he had consecrated
to it, and in which, collecting anew all its forces, his vast genius would have
undoubtedly appeared in all its grandeur. But though this work remained
unaccomplished, its principal elements subsist, as they are scattered in various
memoirs, especially in his Legons @anatomie comparée and his Recherches sur les
ossements fossiles, immortal labors which have communicated to comparative
anatomy such an impulsion that, after having been so long the most neglected
of the branches of natural history, it has suddenly outstripped and taken the lead
of all of them.

The history of comparative anatomy counts three epochs clearly marked—
the epoch of Aristotle, that of Claude Perrault, and that of Cuvier. Every
one knows with how much genius the foundations of the science were laid by
Aristotle among the ancients. But what is not as well known, though not less
worthy of being so, is the force of intellect with which Claude Perrault, at the
middle of the seventeenth century, undertook the reconstruction of the! entire
science from its very base—that is to say, from the consideration of particular
facts. His descriptions are the first assured step taken by comparative anatomy
in modern times. Daubenton advanced it still another, for he rendered those
descriptions comparable. Vicq-d’Azyr went yet further. Rich through the
labors of Daubenton, of Haller, of Hunter, of Monro, of Camper, of Pallas,
Vicq-d’ Azyr embraced comparative anatomy in its completeness ; he brought to it
that penetratimg genius which sees in science the end to be attained, and that
spirit of sequence which attainsit; and by no one more than by him was that
great reform promoted which M. Cuvi ier finally achieved for the science in question.

It was certainly fortunate for this ‘science to have passed immediately from the
hands of one of these two eminent men into the hands of the other. Vi ieq-d’ Azyr
had thrown on it the glance of the physiologist; M. Cuvier threw on it more
particularly that of the zoologist, and we may concede that it had an equal
need of being considered under both these points of view. It may well be
thonght that its reform would not have been so complete and its influence so
gener ral except that, having been by turns studied and adapted with a view both
to zoology and physiology, it has beconie alike for both the guide and the Imni-

nary.

However this may be, comparative anatomy was still but a collection of par-
ticular facts touching the structure of animals, when M. Cuvier transformed it
into the science of the general laws of the animal organization. Atter having
transformed, as we have seen, the zoological method from being a simple nomen-
clature into an instrument of generalization, he now proceeded to dispose the facts
in comparative anatomy in such an order that, from their simple collocation, have
proceeded so many admirable and progressively ascending laws; as, for ex cample,
that each kind of organ bas its fixed and determined modifications that a con-

de M. Cuvier.
125 MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

stant relation connects all modifications of the organism with one another; that
certain organs exert on the collective animal economy a more marked and
decisive influence, whence the law of their subordination ; that certain facts of
otganization necessarily involve the presence of each other, while there are such,
on the contrary, as are incompatible and exclusive, one of the other, whence the
law of their correlation or coexistence ; besides so many other laws,,so many
other general relations, which have, in the end, created and developed the
philosophic part of the science.

Among so many discoveries, so many particular facts with which he has
enriched that science, I must necessarily confine myself to a citation of the most
prominent, and still the catalogue of even these will be far from complete. The
researches of Hunter and of enon had already afforded valuable contributions
to the theory of the development of the teeth ; it was Cuvier who carried this theory
to a perfection beyond which there can be little to desire. Those little bones
which we call teeth appear at first glance to be very simple, and scarcely to
merit the attention of the observer. ‘These little bodies, however, are very
complex; they possess secretory organs, as their g germ, their proper membrane ;
secreted substances, such as their enamel, their ivory ; and each of these sub-
stances appears in its turn, each at a fixed epoch. They spring up, are devel-
oped, push forth their roots, die, fall, and are replaced by others with admirable
order and regularity. Nor is it less admirable, though under another point of
view, that all the circumstances of their organization and development are to-
day rigorously demonstrated. It was chiefly through a study of the teeth of
the elephant, where everything is scen on a large scale, that M. Cuvier succeeded
in establishing the precise epoch at which each part of the tooth is formed, and
by what mechanism it is formed ; how each of these parts, having performed its
function of productive organ, disappears; how the entire tooth disappears in its
turn to give place to another, which will also have its development, both in the
whole and in det ail, its point of complete organization, and its decay and its fall.

Perrault, Hérissant , Vieq-d’Azyr, had, before Cuvier, distinguished some points
in the structure of the vocal organs of birds ; he has made that structure known
in a general manner and by detailed comparisons. It was he also who first
placed i in a clear light the ‘singular arrangement of the organ of hearing, and
still more singular arrangement of the nasal Joss@ in the cetaceous tribes.

Every one ‘knows the marvellous metamorphosis experienced by the frog in
passing from the state of foetus or tadpole to the adult state. It is known that
after having respired, in the first case, by gills, like the fishes, it respires, in the
second, by ‘lungs, like the terrestrial animals. M. Cuvier has taught us the
structure of the organs of respiration and of circulation in a species of reptiles,
which presents something still more curious. The frog is by turns a fish in its
first stage, and a reptile in its second. ‘These new reptiles, still more singular,
such as the proteus, the axolotl, the siren, are all their life reptiles and fish;
have all the time both branchie@ or gills and lungs, and can hence breathe alter-
nately in the air and in water.

M. Cuvier again was the first to give a connected comparison of the brain in
the four classes of vertebrate animals 3; the first to point out the relations of the
development of that organ with the development of intelligence, a branch of
comparative anatomy which has since become so fruitful and extensive ; the first,
in fine, to deduce in a rigorous manner from the respective quantity of respira-
tion of these animals, not only the degree of their natural heat, but that of all
their other faculties, their force of movement, their subtility of perception, their
rapidity of digestion.

But the most novel and brilliant application which he has made of compara-
tive anatomy, is that which relates to fossil bones. Every one now knows that
the globe which we inhabit presents, almost everywhere, irrefutable traces of
stupendous revolutions. ‘The productions of the actual creation, of living nature,

.
MEMOIR OF CUVIER. 129

everywhere cover the remains of an earlier creation, of a ruined nature. On
the one hand immense masses of shells and of other marine bodies are found at
great distances from any sea, at heights to which no sea could now attain, and
from thence have been derived the first facts in support of all those traditions of
deluges preserved among so many tribes of mankind. On the other hand, the
large bones discovered from time to time in the bowels of the earth, inthe caverns
of the mountains, have given rise to those other popular traditions, not less
diffused and not less ancient, of races of giants which have peopled the world in
its first ages.

The traces of the revolutions of our globe have, therefore, at all tinies im-
pressed the minds of men, but they long impressed ther m in vain, and only with
a fruitless astonishment. Fora long time, indeed, ignorance was ’ cartied to such
a point that an opinion very nearly univ ersal, and I speak not here of popular
opinion, but of the opinion of savants and philosophers, regarded the stones
charged with the impressions of animals or plants and the shells found in the

earth as sports of nature. “ It was necessar y,” says Fontenelle, “ that a common
potter, who knew neither Latin nor Greek, should dare, about the end of the
sixteenth century, to say in Paris, and in the face of all the doctors, that the
fossil shells were real shells, deposited heretofore by the sea in the places where
they were then found; that animals had impressed on the figure-bearing stones
all their different figures, and that he should boldly defy the whole school of
Aristotle to contest his proofs.”
' ‘This potter was Bernard Palissy, renowned for having made barely a first step
in a route traversed since then by so many great men, and which has conducted
them to such astonishing discoveries. In truth, the ideas of Palissy could
scarcely be expected to attract notice at the epoch when they appeared, and it
was not till about a century later—that is to say, toward the close of the seven-
teenth century—that they began to revive, and, again to recall an expression of
Fontenelle’s, “to thrive in the world as they deserved to do.” But from that
time such was the activity put forth, both in ‘collecting the remains of organized
bodies buried beneath the surface of the earth and in Y studying the strata which
contain them, and under this twofold relation so rapidly were significant facts
multiplied, that some bold and perspicacious minds were not afraid even then to
combine them i generalizations and attempt to ascend to their causes. It was,
in effect, at the close of the seventeenth century, and during the first half of the
eighteenth, that the celebrated systems of Burnet, Leibnitz, Woodward, Whis-
ton, and Buffon made their appearance—all of them premature and more or less
erroneous, no doubt, but productive of this advantage, that they accustomed the
human intellect to contemplate these astounding ‘phenomena i in a philosophic
spirit, and not to shrink from measuring itself against them.

Another advantage, of even greater Say ee was, that all these systems, by
exciting a strong interest, prese mntly drew together from all parts observations at
once more numerous, precise and complete ; the first effect of which was to over-
turn all that was imaginary and absurd in those systems; and the second, to
found on their ruins the true theory, the positive history of the earth.

The eighteenth century, which advanced so rapidly in so many directions, per-
haps witnessed nothing more rapid than the progress of the science of which
we are speaking. ‘The same ce utury which in its first moiety had seen all the
systems just spoken of, structures as brilliant as frail, either rise or fall, this cen-
tury s saw, in its second, the first foundations of the ‘enduring monume ont which
was to succeed them, cast by the hands of a Pallas, a Delue, a de Saussure, a
Werner, a Blumenbach, a Camper, and others who so ably seconded them.

Among these advances it is proper that I should here especially recall those
which relate to the fossil remains of organized bodies. It was these remains, in
effect, subsisting witnesses as they are of so many revolutions, so many violent
subversions sustained by the globe, which had given rise to the first hypothesis

130 MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

of the fantastic geology ; and it was again these remains which, in the hands of
M. Cuvier, furnished the results the most evident and the laws ‘best ascertained
of the positive geology. The researches of M. Cuvier were principally directed
to the fossil bones of quadrupeds—a part of the animal kingdom till then little
studied under this new point of view, but the study of which was calculated to
lead to consequences much more precise and decisive than that of any other
class.

T have already mentioned the large fossil bones discovered at different epochs,
and the absurd ideas of giants, which were renewed at each discovery which was
made of them. Daubenton was the first to overthrow all these ideas; it was he
who first applied comparative anatomy to the determination of the remains in
question; but, as he himself avows, this science was as yet far from being suth-
ciently advanced to furnish, in all cases and with sufficient certainty, the species
or genus of animal to w hich an unknown and isolated bone might appertain, and
yet such was the problem to be solved. ‘The memoir in which Daubenton
attempted for the first time the solution of this important problem was of the
date of 1762.

In 1769 Pallas published his first memoir on the fossil bones of Siberia. It
was not without surprise that the demonstration was here seen of the fact that
the elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus—animals which at present live
only under the torrid zone—had heretofore inhabited the most northern portions
of our continents. The second memoir of Pallas could not but excite still more
wonder, for he there reports the fact, which could scarcely seem credible at,
that time, that a rhinoceros had been found entire in the frozen earth with its
skin and flesh—a fact since renewed, as is known to all, in the elephant discov-
ered in 1806 on the shores of the Glacial sea, and so well preserved that dogs
and bears devoured its flesh and disputed its remains with one another.

The impulse once communicated by Pallas, the relics of animals of the south
were soon found, not only in the countries of the north, but in all the regions of
the old as well as new world. Buffon, from these facts, hastened to deduce his
hypothesis of the gradual refrigeration of the polar regions and of the succes-
sive migration of animals from the north to the south. But the last fact observed
by Pallas, and which has just been cited, had already overthrown this assump-
tion. That fact effectually demonstrated, in the most formal manner, that the
refrigeration of the globe, far from having been gradual, had, on the contrar Y>
necessarily been sudden, instantaneous, without any gradation; it demonstrated
that the same instant which destroved the animals in question had rendered the
country of their habitat glacial; for had they not been frozen as soon as killed
it is evident that they could not have descended to us with their flesh and skin
and every part in perfect preservation. The hypothesis of gradual refrigeration
being thus untenable, Pallas substituted that of an irruption of water coming
from the southeast—an irruption which, he maintained, would have transported
into the north the animals of India; but this second hypothesis was not more
happy than the first, for the fossil animals are very different from those of India,
and indeed from all animals now living—a final fact more extraordinary still
than all which preceded it, and which it was reserved for M. Cuvier to place in
the clearest light.

The fact of an ancient creation of animals entirely distinct from the existing
creation, and long since entirely lost, is the fundamental fact on which rest the
most evident proofs of the revolutions of the globe. It cannot, therefore, be
without interest to observe how the idea of this fact, assuredly the most extra-
ordinary which scientific research has been enabled to discover and to prove,
had its first rise, its subsequent development, and final confirmation.

We have seen how, toward the end of the sixteenth century, Bernard Palissy
had ventured, first among the moderns, to maintain that the bones, the impres-
sions, the fossil shells, so long regarded as casual freaks of nature, were the

.
MEMOIR OF CUVIER. 131

remains of real creatures, the veritable spoils of organized bodies. In 1670
Augustine Scilla renewed the opinion of Palissy and sustained it with vigor.
Shortly after, in 1683, Leibnitz lent to it the authority of his name and genius.
¥ inally, from the first half of the eighteenth century, Buffon reproduced it with
still more splendor, and directly made it popular.

But are these organized beings, of which innumerable relies are scattered
everywhere, the analogues of those which are now living, whether in the places
where these relics are found or in others? or have, indeed, their species, their
genera, perished? It is here that the difficulty lies, and we may well believe
that this difficulty would never have been resolved, at least with complete cer-
tainty, as long as the inquiry had been restricted, for example, to the study of
fossil shells or of fishes. It would have availed little, in effect, to find new
shells, new fishes; we should have been always at liberty to suppose that their
species were still living, whether in distant seas or at inaccessible depths. Not
so, however, as recards quadrupeds. ‘The number of these is greatly more lim-
ited, especially for the larger species , we may count on attaining a knowledge of
all of them—how vastly more easy then to satisfy ourselves whether certain
unknown bones belong to one of these species still ‘living, or whether they pro-
ceed from such as are ‘lost.

This it is which gives to the study of fossil quadrupeds a peculiar import-
ance and to the deductions which may be drawn from it a force which dedue-
tions derived from a study of most of the other classes gould not possess. Buffon
seems to have felt this. It was chiefly on the great fossil bones of Siberia and
Canada that he sought to sustain the conjecture (for, in view of the state of
comparative anatomy at the time when he wrote, it could be only a conjecture)
of certain lost species. Besides, even this conjecture was so imperfectly estab-
lished in his own mind, at least in relation to quadrupeds, that after having
regarded, in his Théorie de la Terre, all the animals to which these ext? aordinary
bones had belonged as lost, he afterwards declared, in his Epoques de la Nature,
that he no longer recognized more than a single ‘ost species—that which has
been called the mastodon—and that all the other bones in question are merely
those of the elephant and the hippopotamus.

Camper went much further, as might have been expected, for comparative
anatomy had not failed to advance by long strides since the days of Buffon.
In 1787, in a memoir addressed to Pallas , Camper boldly enunciates the opinion
that certain species have been destroyed by the catastrophes of the globe, and,
moreover, sustains it by the first really positive facts, though still very incom-
plete, which had yet been advanced in its support. T ‘hus, in proportion to the
determination of fossil bones has been the progress of the idea of lost anitnals,
and it has always been by the light of comparative anatomy that this progress
was accomplished. It was, in effect, this light of comparative anatomy which
had been wanting to so many laborious researches of so many naturalists. But
it is easy to see that towards the epoch of which I speak, towards the close,
namely, of the eighteenth century, everything was prepared for the long-sought
solution; that the moment was at hand for some revelation, some complete and
definitive result respecting these strange and marvellous phenomena.

The 1st Pluviose, an 1V, (February, 1796,) being the day of the first public
session held by the National Institute, M. Cuvier read before the assembled body
his memoir on the fossil species of the elephant compared with the living species.
It was in this memoir that he announced, for the first time, his views on extinct
animals. Thus, on the same day when the Institute opened the first of its public
sessions, was opened also the career of the greatest discoveries which natural
history has made in our age: a singular coincidence, which the history of the
sciences should not fail to mark and ¢ commemorate.

M. Cuvier had now initiated that brilliant series of researches and labors
which occupied him so many years, and which, during the whole time, called
LZ? MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

forth renewed surprise and admiration on the part of his contemporaries. In this
first memoir he does not confine himself to demonstrating that the fossil elephant
is a distinct species from the existing species—that it is a species extinct and
lost ; he expressly declares that the greatest step which could be made towards
the perfection of the theory of the earth, would be to prove that none of those
animals whose remains are found dispersed over nearly all points of the globe,
any longer exist. He adds that what he then established in regard to the
elephant he would soon establish in a not less incontestable manner in regard to
the fossil. rhinoceros, bear, and deer, all of them species equally distinct from
living species, all of them equally lost. Finally he concludes with the following
remarkable words, in which he seemed to announce all that he has since dis-
covered: “If it be asked why we find so many remains of unknown animals,
while we find none of which it can be said that they belong to species that we
know, it will be seen how probable it is that they have all pertained to the
creatures of a world anterior to our own; to creatures destroyed by some catas-
trophe of the globe; to creatures whose place has been filled by those which
exist to-day.”

Thus the idea of an entire creation of animals anterior to the actual creation,
the idea of an entire creation destroyed and lost had at last been fully conceived ;
and had found an utterance which proved to be a final solution of the doubts
which, for a century, had so strongly occupied the human mind.

But, in order to transform into a positive result views thus vast and elevated,
it was necessary to assemble from all quarters the remains of the lost animals,
to pass them in review, to study them under this new aspect ; it was necessary to
compare them all, one after the other, with the remains of living animals; and,
first of all, it was necessary to create and determine the art itself by which this
comparison was to be made.

Now, for a right conception of all the difficulties of this new method, this new
art, it is sufficient to remark that the debris of the animals in question, the fossil
bones, are almost always isolated and dispersed; that often the bones of several
species, and those the most diverse, are mingled in confusion ; that almost always
these bones are mutilated, broken, reduced to fragments. It was requisite, there-
fore, to refer each bone to the species to which it pertained; to reconstruct, if
possible, the complete skeleton of each species, without omiting any of the
pieces which were its own, without intercalating any which were foreign to it.
Let us now represent to ourselves this confused intermingling of mutilated and
imperfect relics assembled together by M. Cuvier; let us conceive each bone,
each portion of a bone, taking its place under his skilful hand, each uniting
itself to the bone or portion of bone to which it had pertained; let us
observe all these species of animals, destroyed for so many ages, thus rising
before us in their various forms, with each character, each attribute restored, and
we shall scarcely realize that we are witnessing a simple anatomical operation,
but rather a sort of resurrection; nor will it abate anything of the prodigy that
it is a resurrection effected at the voice of science and of genius.

I say at the voice of science. 'The method employed “by M. Cuvier for this
wonderful reconstruction is, in effect, but the application of the general rules of
comparative anatomy to the determination of fossil bones. And these rules
themselves are a not less grand, less admirable discovery than the surprising
results to which they have led.

It has been seen above how a rational principle, that of the subordination of
organs, everywhere applied, everywhere reproduced in establishing the groups
of the method, had changed the face of the classification of the animal king-
dom. ‘The principle which presided at the reconstruction of lost species is
that of the correlation of forms, a principle by means of which each part of an
animal may be given by each other part, and the whole animal by a single part.
In a mechanism as complex, and yet as essentially a unit as that which constitutes

s
MEMOIR OF CUVIER. 138

the animal frame, it is evident that all the parts must necessarily be constructed
one with reference to the others, so as to correspond, to adapt themselves to one
another, to form, in a word, by their assemblage, one being, one unique system.
A single one of these parts, therefor e, cannot change its form without necessitating
a change i in form of all the others. Hence fermi the form of one part may be
deduced the form of all the other parts.

Suppose a carnivorous animal; it will necessarily have the organs of sense
and of movement; the claws, teeth, stomach, intestines, adapted for scenting
seizing, tearing, digesting its animal prey, and all these conditions will be
rigorously linked with one another ; for, if one be wanting, the others would be
without effect, without result; the creature could not subsist. Suppose, on the
other hand, an herbivorous animal; all this assemblage of conditions will have
changed. ‘The teeth, the feet, the stomach, the intestines, the organs of move-
ment and of sense, will all have assumed new forms, and these new forms will
always be proportioned and related one to the others. Irom the form of a sin-
gle one of these parts, therefore, from that of the teeth alone, for example, we
may infer, and infer with certainty, the form of the feet, that of the jaws, that
of the stomach, that of the intestines.

All the parts, all the organs, are deducible, then, one from the other; and
such is the rigor, such the infallibility of this deduction, that M. Cuvier has been
often known to recognize an animal by a single bone, nay by the facet of a
bone; that he has been known to determine unknown genera and species from
a few broken bones, and this from such or such a bone taken at random, recon-
structing in this way the entire animal from a single one of its parts, and causing
it to reappear, as at will, from each of them; results which cannot be recalled
without recalling in effect all that admiration, mingled with surprise, which they
at first inspired, and which is not yet exhausted.

That precise and rigorous method of distinguishing bones confounded together—
of referring each bone to its species; of reconstructing the entire animal from
some of its parts—that method once conceived, it was no longer by isolated
species but by groups and masses that these extinct populations, antique monu-
ments of the revolutions of the globe, reappeared. An idea might then be
formed not only of their extraordinary appearance, but of the prodigious multi-
tude of their species. It was seen that they comprised creatures of all classes,
quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, fishes, down to crustacea, mollusks, and zoophytes.
Nor, though I speak here only of animals, does the study of fossil vegetables
furnish consequences less curious than those drawn from the animal kingdom.
All these organized beings, all these first occupants of the globe, are distinguished
by their proper characters, and often by characters the most singular and
grotesque.

Among the quadrupeds, for example, we first observe the palwotherium, the
anoplotherium, those strange specimens of pachydermata, discovered by M.
Cuvier in the environs of Paris, and of which none bearing this peculiar charac-
ter has descended to our times. Afterwards comes the mammoth, that elephant
of Siberia, covered with long hairs and a thick wool; the mastodon, an animal
almost as ‘large as the mammoth, and whose teat lis armed with points, long
caused it to be regarded as a arnivorous elephant, together with those enormous
sloths, the megatheri tum, the megalonyz, animals of which the existing species do
not exceed the size of a dog, while some of those which are lost equalled the
largest rhinoceros. Still more extraordinary were the reptiles of those first ages
of the world, * whether from their gigantic proportions, for there were lizay ds as
large as w hales, or from the singularity of their structure, for some had the aspect
of the cefaceu’or marine mammifers, and others the neck and beak of birds, and
even a kind of wing.

* Such as the megalosaurus, which was more than 60 feet in length; the ichthyosaurus and
the plesiosaurus, whose inembers are called those of the cetacea ; the pterodactyls, which have a
very long projection from the anterior extremity, bearing a membrane or sort of wing.
134 MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

And what is still more surprising is that all these animals did not live at one
and the same epoch; that there were several generations, several populations,
so to speak, successively created and destroyed. Of these M. Cuvier has
counted as many as three distinctly marked. The first comprised the mollusks,
the fishes, the reptiles, all those monstrous reptiles just spoken of; among them
were already found some marine mammifers, but no terrestrial mammifer, or
scarcely any, then existed. The second epoch was chiefly characterized by those
strange species of pachydermata of the environs of Paris, above mentioned, and
it was now only that the terrestrial mammifers began to predominate. The third
was the epoch of the mammoth, the mastodon, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus,
the gigantic sloths. A remarkable fact is that among all these animals there is
scarcely one of the quadrumana ; scarcely one of the ape tribe.* And still
more remarkable, there was no man; the human race therefore was neither
cotemporaneous with any of these lost species nor with the catastrophes which
destroyed them t

Thus, then, after the age of reptiles, after that of the first terrestrial mammi-
fers, after that of the mammoths and mastodons, arrived a fourth epoch, a fourth
snecession of created beings, that which constitutes the actual population, that
which may be called the age of man, for from this age only dates the human
species. The creation of the animal kingdom, therefore, has undergone several
interruptions, several successive destructions; and what is not less wonderful,
though altogether certain, is, that there was an epoch, the first of all, when no
organized being, no animal, no vegetable existed on the globe.

All these extraordinary facts are demonstrated by the relations of the remains
of organized beings to the strata which form the crust of the globe. Thus there
was a first epoch when these beings did not exist, for the primitive or primordial
formations contain none of their remains; the reptiles prevailed in the following
epoch, for their remains abound in the formations which succeed the primitive ;
the surface of the earth has been several times covered by the seas, and again
left dry, for the remains of marine animals cover turn by turn the remains of
terrestrial animals and are alternately covered by them.

Thus has science, guided by genius, been enabled to ascend to the most remote
epochs of the history of the earth ; to compute and determine those epochs; to
mark both the first moment when organized beings appeared on the globe, and all
the variations, modifications, and revolutions they have experienced. It were unjust,
doubless, to convey the impression that all the proofs of this great history have
been collected by M. Cuvier; but even where others after him have made discoveries
in the same field, some portion of glory must redound to him by whose footsteps
they have been gnided. It may be said, indeed, that the more valuable those
discoveries, the more important all those which shall be made in the future, the
more will his renown be enhanced, even as the name of Columbus has been
exalted in proportion as the navigators who have come after him have rendered
better known the whole extent of his conquest.

This unknown world opened to naturalists is undoubtedly the most brilliant
discovery of M. Cuvier. Yet I do not hesitate to place beside it that other dis-
covery, in my eyes not less important, of the true method in natural history.

The need of methods to our understanding arises equally from the need it has
of distinguishing in order to know, and the need it has of generalizing what it
knows in order to be able to embrace and clearly to conceive the greatest possi-

+ More recent investigations have led to a different conclusion; from these it seems to have
been established that the appearance of man upon earth must be carried back much further
than has been generally supposed ; that he witnessed more than one of the catastrophes
alluded to, and was obliged to dispute his mundane inheritance with several of the gigantic
or ferocious animals of the ‘‘ third epoch.” See Smithsonian Report for 1867, ‘‘ Manas a cotem-
porary of the mammoth, &c.”—TR.

MEMOIR OF CUVIER. 135

ble number of facts and of ideas. All method has, therefore, a double object,
namely, the distinction and the generalization of facts. Now, till M® Cavier’s
method had been limited to separating and distinguishing ; it was he who made
of it, as I have already said, an instrument of gener ralization, by which he has
rendered a lasting service hot only to natural histor y, but, I venture to assert, to
all the sciences.

For method, understanding thereby the true method, is essentially one. Its
object everywhere is to raise itself to the most general relations, to the most sim-
ple expression of things, and in such sort that all these relations shall spring
one from the other, and all from particular facts which are the origin and source
of them. It is this which Bacon meant when he said that all our sciences are
but generalized facts, a phrase which admirably denotes the process followed by
M. Cuvier,

This generalization of facts was, in effect, the potent instrument by which he
created the science of fossil remains; by which he renewed, in every part,
geology and comparative anatomy ; by which he was enabled, in every order of
facts, to ptrsue them to their principle, and their ultimate principle, carrying
zoological classification to its rational principle, the sbordination of organs ;
founding the reconstruction of extinct animals on the principle of the correlation
of forms ; demonstrating the necessity of certain intervals, certain interruptions
in the scale of beings, by the very impossibility of certain coexistencies, of cer-
tain combinations of organs. It is in this habit of his intellect of ascending in
everything to a principle unassailable and demonstrated that we must seck the
secret of that inimitable clearness which he sheds over all the sul yects of which
he treats; for clearness results in all cases from the ordering of the thoughts
and the unbroken chain of their inter- dependence. It is in this habit, moreover,
that we find the reason why his opinions, in every kind, are so fixed, so final;
it is because he never contents himself with isolated and fortuitous relations, but
always ascends to those which are necessary, and of these allows none to escape
him.

In M. Cuvier two things equally strike us: the extreme precocity of his views,
for it was by his first memoir on the class vermes of Linnzeus that he reformed
not only that class, but, through it, the whole of zoology; it was by his first
course of comparative anatomy that he recast the entire science and re-estab-
lished it on a new basis; it was by his first memoir on fossil elephants that he
laid the foundation of a science wholly new, the science of extinct animals; and
again, that spirit of sequence, of perseverance, of undiverted constancy, by which
he developed and fertilized his views, conseerating an entire life to establish, to
demonstrate them, to mature them by experiment, to transform them finally from
simple views, fruits of a bold conception, of a sudden inspiration, into truths of
fact and observation.

If we follow this celebrated man in the different paths he has traced, we find
throughout those dominant qualities of his genius, order, comprehensiveness,
elevation of thought, clearness, precision; force of expression. We find all
these qualities united to a style still more animated, varied, and forcible in those
Eloges Historiques which long formed so large a part of the charm and éclat of
the public meetings of the ace ademy. On these memoirs praise has been already
lavishly bestowed, nor would it be easy too highly to extol the spirit and anima-
tion which diffuse through them so much movement and life; the art of so
piquantly recounting an anecdote or painting a characteristic ; the v igor of con-
ception which binds all the parts of the discourse into a whole so compactly put
together that it might seem to have been created at a single stroke ; the singular
aptitude, i in fine, to rise to the most varied and comprehensive consider rations and
to depict so many different personages in a manner equally just and striking.
If examined with somewhat closer attention we remark, and with perhaps even
greater pleasure, the same sagacity of observation, the same analogical subtlety,
136 MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

the same art of comparing and subordinating, of ascending to the ultimate gen-
eralizatidh of facts, here transferred to another field; and, in addition to all this,
those luminous and penetrating touches which suddenly arrest the attention of
the reader and transport him to the level of an elevated order of ideas.

M. Cuvier seems, in effect, to have been destined to give a new character to
whatever passed through his hands. Into his instructions upon natural history
he introduced those philosophic and general views which had scarcely before
penetrated to the schools. In his eloquent lectures the history of the sciences
became the history of the human mind itself, for in going back to the causes of
their progress and their errors he was always careful to point out that those
causes were to be found in the right or the wrong processes which the human
mind had pursued. It was here that, to use one of his own happy expressions,
he submitted the human mind to experiment, showing, by the whole testimony of
the history of the sciences, that the most ingenious hypotheses, the most brilliant
systems, do but pass and disappear, and that facts alone remain ; ; Opposing every-
where to the methods of speculation, which have never produced any durable
result, the methods of observation and experiment, to which we owe all the dis-
coveries and all the real knowledge which constitute the actual heritage of man-
kind.

Ah! in what mouth could these great results, drawn from the history of science—
that experimental theory of the “human mind, if I may so speak—have more
authority than in his?) Who has shown hiaeele more constantly attached to
observation, to experiment, to the rigorous study of facts, while at the same time
enriching his era with truths the most novel and sublime?

Since men have observed with precision, and have pursued experiment in a
consecutive manner, a space of some two centuries, they ought, it would seem,
to have renounced the mania of seeking to divine, ‘instead of observing ; for, in
the first place, it must prove wearisome in the lone run to be always divining
unskilfully ; and, in the next place, it should by this time have been recognized
that what we wmagine is always below what really exists, and that, in a word,
and to consider only the brilliant side of our theories, the marvellous of the
imagination is always very far from approaching the marvellous of nature.

The delivery of M. Cuvier was in general erave, and even somewhat slow,
especially towards the opening of his lectures; but soon his utterance became
animated by the movement of his thoughts, and then this movement, communi-

vated by the thought to the expression, the penetrating voice, the inspiration of
his genius reflected in his eyes and on his features, all conspired to produce upon
his audience the most vivid and profound impression. One felt exalted even
less by those grand and unexpected ideas which shone throughout than by a
certain force of. conception and of thought which seemed by turns to arouse and
penetrate the mind of the hearer. Into the career of the. professor he carried
the same character of invention as into the career of research and discovery.
After having remodelled the school of comparative anatomy at the Jardin des
Plantes, we have seen him convert a simple chair of natural history at the Col-
lege of France into a true chair of the philosophy of the sciences: two crea-
tions which well portray his genius, and which in the eyes of posterity must
reflect honor on our age.

M. Cuvier has left memoirs of his life, designed, as he himself writes, for him
who should have to pronounce his eulogy before this Academy. The eare which
he has thus taken in favor of my auditory makes it imperative on me to add
some details taken from those memoirs: “I have composed (he says in begin-
ning) so many éloges historiques that there is no presumption in thinking that
some one will compose mine, and knowing by experience what it costs the authors
of this sort of writings to become informed respecting the life of those of whom
they have to speak, [ wish to spare that trouble to him who shall occupy him-

self with my own. Linnzeus, enon, and others, perhaps, have not judged this

MEMOIR OF CUVIER. 1a7

attention to be beneath them, and they have therein rendered a service to the
history of the sciences. These (he continues) are respectable examples, and
which I may oppose to those who shall tax me on this point with a trifling vanity.”

He did not foresee that the details of his life were destined to become so popular
that he who should have the honor of pronouncing his eulogy would scarcely
dare to reproduce them.

George Cuvier* was born August 23, 1769, at Montbéliard, a city then belong-
ing to the duchy of Wurtemberg, but which ‘has since been reunited to Fr rance.
His family was originally from a 2 village of the Jura which still bears the name
of Cuvier. At the era of the Reformation it had established itself in the little
principality of Montbéliard, where some of its members have filled distinguished
places. ‘The grandfather of M. Cuvier was of one of the poorer branches; he
was town clerk. Of two sons whom he had, the second entered a Swiss regiment
in the service of France, and having become, through good conduct and bravery,
an officer and chevalier of the order of merit, married, at the age of fifty years,
a woman still quite young, and whose memory should be dear to posterity, for
she was the mother of Cuvier, and, moreover, his first preceptor.

A woman of superior mind, a mother full of tenderness, the instruction of her son
soon became her whole occupation. Although she did not know Latin, she made
him repeat his lessons; execute his drawings under her eyes; read to her many
books of history and literature; and it was thus that she developed, that she
nourished in her young pupil that passion for reading, and that curiosity about
all things, which, as M. Cuvier himself says in the memoirs intrusted to me, had
formed the mainspring of his life.

At an early age there was seen in this child that prodigious aptitude for all,
mental labor, which still later formed one of the distinctive traits of his genius.
Everything aroused, everything excited his activity. A copy of Buffon, which
he finds by chance in the library of one of his relations, suddenly kindles his

taste for natural history. He immediately sets about copying the figures and
coloring them from the descriptions—a labor which, at so early an age, certainly
denoted a sagacity of observation of a high order.

The residence of the young Cuvier at the academy of Stuttgard is too well known
to be long dwelt upon. 'The sovereign of a small state, Charles, duke of Wur-
temberg, seemed to have proposed to show to the greatest nations what they
might do for the instruction of youth. “There were here collected in a magnifi-
cent establishment more than 400 pupils, who received the lessons of more than
80 masters. Here were trained, at the same time, painters, sculptors, musicians,
diplomatists, jurists, physicians, soldiers, professors in all the sciences. Of the
higher faculties there were five: law, medicine, administration, military art, and
commerce. ‘The course of philosophy finished, the pupils passed into one of
these faculties. Cuvier chose that of administration, and the motive he assigns
for it should be reported: “It was,” he says, “ because in this faculty there was
much to do with natural history, and, consequently, frequent opportunities of
herborizing and of visiting the cabinets.”

Everything in the life of a great man interests us, but doubly so whatever
serves to throw light on the process of his labors. We would gladly follow him
through the whole course which he has traversed in changing the face of the
sciences, and even from his earliest steps would divine something of the direction
and character of his thoughts. It has just been seen that our naturalist, yet a
child, at sight of the first figures of natural history which fall into his hands, at
once conceives the idea of coloring them after the descriptions. While still at
Stuttgard one of the professors, w hose lectures he had translated into F1 ‘ench,
makes him a present of Linnzus. It was the tenth edition of the Systeme de
la nature, and this book forms, for ten years, his whole library of natural history.
But, in default of books, he had the objects; and this direct, exclusive e study

138 MEMOIR OF CUVIER.

of the objects engraved them much better in his mind than if, to use his own
expression, he had had at his disposal any number of prints and descriptions.
Besides, having neither figures nor descriptions he made them for himself.

Still, all these excursions into natural history had not interfered with the pre-
scribed studies ; he had borne off almost all the prizes; had obtained the order
of chevalier which was accorded to only five or six of all those young persons ;
and, according to appearances, he might have promptly obtained an appointment.
But, fortunately for him and for natural history—and these two destinies were
thenceforth inseparable—the situation of his parents did not permit him to wait.
Tt was necessary for him to decide, and the place of preceptor having been
offered to him by a family of Normandy at the moment when he was quitting
Stuttgard, he hastened to accept it, and at once set out for Caen, where he
arrived July, 1788, being then something less than 19 years of age.

From this moment his 1 passion for natural histor y acquired new force. ‘The
family of Herici, to which he was attached, went to reside at a country seat of
Caux, a short distance from Fécamp. It was here that our young naturalist
lived from 91 to 94, surrounded, as he says, with the most diversified products,
lavished upon him, as if in emulation, by the sea and land ; always in the midst
of such objects, almost without books, having no one to whom he could commu-
nicate his reflections, which, therefore, only acquired the greater depth and
energy. It was at this period, in effect, that his mind began to open for itself
new paths; it was then that at the sight of some ¢erebratule, disinterred near
Fécamp, he conceived the idea of comparing fossil with living species; that the
dissection of some mollusks suggested to him that other idea of a reform to be
introduced in the methodical distribution of animals; so that the germs of his
two most important labors, the comparison of fossil with living species, and the
reform of the classification of the animal kingdom, ascend to this epoch.

Irom this epoch also date his first relations with M. Tessier, whom the
storms of the revolution then retained at Fécamp, and who had there occupied
for some time the place of physician-in-chief of the military hospital. M. 'Tes-
sier could not see the young Cuvier without being struck with the extent of his
‘knowledge. He first eng: aged him to deliver a course of botany to the physicians
of his hospital ; he afterwards wrote to all his friends in Paris to impart, to them
the happy discovery which he lad made, and especially to those of the Jardin
des Plantes, who at onee conceived the idea of calling the young naturalist
thither as assistant of Mertrud, then in charge of the department of comparative
anatomy. “ Often,” says M. ‘Cuvier, in reference to this circumstance, “has a
phrase of M. Tessier, i in his letter to M. de Jussieu, recurred tome: You remem-
ber, he said, that it was I who gave Delambre to the academy ; im another walk
this also will be a Delambre.” It was to M. Tessier, therefore, that the Academy
of Sciences owed both Delambre and Cuvier. A man who should have rendered
but these two services to the sciences might count on the respect and gratitude
of all who cultivate them. But how ine more vividly do such fnideatis touch
us when they embellish a life wholly consecrated to science, its progress and
application, and spent in a long succession of useful labors and virtuous actions !

It was said by Fontenelle to be a piece of good fortune on the part of savants,
whom their reputation might afterwards call ‘to the capital, to have had leisure
to lay up a good stock of funds in the repose of a province. M. Cuvier’s stock
Was so eood that some months after his arrival in Paris, in 1795, his reputation
already equalled that of the most celebrated naturalists, and the same year, which
was also that of the creation of the National Institute, he was named adjunct of
Daubenton and Lacépide, who formed the nucleus of the section of zoology. ‘The
year following he commenced the courses which became so rapidly celebrated at
the central school of the Pantheon. In 1799, the death of Daubenton led to his
appointment tothe much more important chair of natural history at the college of
France; and, in 1802, Mertrud being dead, he became titular professor at the
Jardin des Plantes.
MEMOIR OF CUVIER lou

It will be recollected that the funetions of secretary of the Institute were at
first temporary. M. Cuvier was called, among the first, to fulfil these functions
in his class, and soon afterwards, in 1803, a new organization of the learned
body having re-established the perpetuity of these offices he was chosen per-
petual secretary for the physical or natural sciences, with nearly entire unanimity.

It was in this new capacity of perpetual secretary that he composed his mem-
orable Leport on the progress of the natural sciences since 1789. Delambre had
been charged with the report on the mathematical sciences, and thus each class
of the institute was called upon to present one on the sciences or arts which fell
within its province. It is well known with what state the Emperor receive A
these reports. The peculiar satisfaction which that of M. Cuvier gave him wi:
expressed by a happy turn of words. ‘He has praised me,’ ’ said the emi
personage, ‘as I like to be praised.” ‘And yet,” remarks M. Cuvier, “ I had
done no more than invite him to imitate Ale: xander, and to make his power
instrumental to the progress of natural history.” But this sort of praise is pre-
cisely that which must most flatter a man who had comprehended all kinds of
glory, and would willingly remain a stranger to none. We are at liberty to
think, morover, that the praise which has no other object but to induce a sover-
eign to do worthy things is not unworthy of a philosopher.

To all these occupations, as historian of the sciences, perpetual secretary, pro-
fessor at the Museum and at the College of France, M. Cuvier added several
others. He was named member of the council of the University in 1808, and
master of requests in 1813. Nor was the Restoration insensible to his merit. He
preserved his position, and was even invested with new functions. Appointed
successively counsellor of state,* president of the commission of the interior,
chancellor of public instruction, and finally, in 1831, peer of France ; his genius
embraced all orders of ideas and lent itself to all kinds of labor.

It may well be supposed that he was a member of all the learned Academies
of the world; for what Academy could have afforded to omit the inscription of
his name on its list? And that which is an honor, of which there were few
examples before him, he belonged tothree Academies of the Institute, the Acade-
mie Francaise, the Academy of Sciences, and that of Inscriptions and Belles-
letters.

His great renown brought to him, from all parts, whatever occurred in the
way of observation and discovery. It was, moreover, in great part lis genius,
his lectures, his works, which animated all observers, and everywhere created
them ; and never could it have been said of any man with more truth than of
him, that nature heard herself everywhere interrogated in his name. Hence
there is nothing comparable to the rich collections which he created at the museum,
and which were all placed in order by him. And when we think of that direct
study of objects which was the principal occupation of his life, and through which
he has occasioned the outgrowth of so many results, it ¢: annot surprise us that
he was often heard to say: “That he believed himself to have been not less
useful to science by his collections alone than by all his other works.”

In the course of a career so full of success and of honors, M. Cuvier had sus-
tained not a few severe blows. He had lost his first two children, either a few
days ora few years after birth; the third, who was a son, died at the age of
seven, and all these sorrows were renewed, and with far more bitterness, when
he lost his daughter, a young lady of rare qualities, who offered, not only in
mind but in features, no faint resemblance to her father. In all the misfortunes
of life his consolation was ordinarily sought in redoubled labor; but a consola-
tion still more efficacious consisted in the affectionate attentions with which his
family, and above all, Madame Cuvier, were sedulous to surround him.

If we consider the numerous public appointments of M. Cuvier, his uninter-

* He was also baron and grand officer of the Legion of Honor. It is well to recall these
titles; a nation honors itself by thus bestowing them.

mitting researches, his voluminous and important works, it seems astonishing that
a single life could have sufficed for so much. But, besides the superior faculties of
his under standing, he possessed an ardent curiosity which impelled him to the pur-
suit of all knowledge ; ; amemory which partook of the wonderful, and a facility
even still more wonderful of passing from one labor to another immediately,
without effort; a singular faculty, and which, perhaps, contributed more than
any other to multiply his time and his ener ey. Moreover, no one ever made so
thorough, and, if I may thus express my self, so methodical astudy of the art of
not losing a single moment. Each hour had its stated labor ; each labor had
a cabinet which was destined for it, and in which all was found that related to
that labor; books, drawings, objects. Everything was prepared, everything
foreseen, so that no external cause might intervene to distract or retard the mind
in the course of its meditations and researches. The address of M. Cuvier was
grave, and his was not a politeness which diffused itself in words, but he possessed
a goodness of heart and a kindness which were prone to proceed always directly
to action. It might be said that in this kind also he dreaded any loss of time.

I need not, in concluding, recal] to my auditors that death, so much deplored
and so sudden, which surprised him in the midst of so many labors and great
dlesigns. That event is too recent, the remembrance too painful, and the regrets
of his colleagues in this Academy, still vivid and profound, are the homage most
worthy of his memor vt Besides, in my feeble sketch of the labors of this great
man, T have less considered the a than the savant. I have chiefly sought to
retrace that series of sublime truths for which the sciences are indebted ‘to his
genius, a genius which is henceforth immortal.

His elory must increase with the progress of the sciences which he created.
Time, which effaces so many other names, perpetuates and surrounds with an
ever renovated lustre the memory of those rare individuals who seem to have
revealed new activities in the intellect, and to have given new forces to thought.
And as their minds, outstripping their age, had posterity chiefly in view, so it is
only posterity, it is only the succession of ages, from which they can expect all
the gratitude and admiration which is due to them.

I.—OF METHOD CONSIDERED IN ITSELF.—RATIONAL METHODS.—EMPIRICAL
METHODS.

Method is a part of logic; it is the approximation of like things, and the sep-
aration of things unlike. Hence, there have always been methods, especially in
natural history, where the number of objects is so great. It was in vain, then,
for Buffon to revolt against methods; in proportion, as passing from quadrupeds
to bird s, he sees the number of species increase, he himself resorts to methodical
approximations; he groups together like species, he constitutes genera; “he
silently submits,” says M. Cuvier, “to the necessity imposed on all of-us, of
classifying our ideas in order clearly to represent to ourselves their ensemble, their
collective import.” Aristotle himself had a method, and indeed an excellent one,
at least for classes.t| He knew that the cetacea are mammiferoust he distin-
guishes in animals with white blood, the mollusca, the crustacea, the insects, &c. §
After the revival of letters the learned were content at first with the method of
Aristotle ; but it was soon found necessary to extend it.

Natural history always resolves itself into specific objects. Method really aids
us only in so far as it leads to species; and since it should lead to species, it is
necessary that it should embrace all species. Now, before Linneeus, it was cus-
tomary to stop, in several classes, at the genera; in other classes, while proceed-
ing to species, only a few were particularized. Linneeus proposed that method,
the distinctive catalogue of beings, should embrace them all; no species, there-
fore, was neglected ; all were studied, independently of their shape, size, relative
utility; all were named. ‘Twenty years after Linneus, the number of known
beings was quintupled.

On the other hand, specific names did not yet exist, only generic ones. Lin-
nzeus founded a nomenclature. Each species had two names: a substantive name
for the genus, an adjective name for the species. || The name of the species no

secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, &c.

tSee the fine eulogy of M. Cuvier himself on the principles of Aristotle: ‘‘Far be it
from us to detract from the glory of the great philosopher whom we recall. We think, on
the contrary, that it is necessary to revive his principles, if we would give to natural history
all its perfection, and we observe with satisfaction that they are beginning to revive.” A
surprising thing, surely! Aristotle had already discovered the great principles of the science
twenty centuries ago; and to rediscover those principles we must come down to Cuvier.

External differences do not, in his eyes, mask internal resemblances ; he places the serpent,
which has no members, by the side of the lizard, which has. ‘‘The serpent,” he says, ‘‘ en-
tirely resembles the lizard, by supposing the latter to be lengthened and retrenching its feet.”

classes: mollusks, crustacea, insects and zoophytes, he improperly joins that of the testacea,
Still, an attentive perusal of the work of Aristotle shows us a surprising number of just
conceptions, even in what may be called the anatomy of detail. ‘‘The ear,” he says, ‘* has
no opening into the brain, but into the palate of the mouth.”—Hist. ef Animals, Book I.

142 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

longer changed, for species is a thing fixed and changes not; but the name of
the genus might change, for the genus only denotes relations, and relations may
vary in proportion as the number of species varies. ‘These simple ideas had,
till then, not been comprehended.

But Linneus, who rendered these two great services, is perhaps, of all nat-
uralists, he who most contributed to the prevalence, at least for a certain time,
of the use of artificial methods. Now, an artificial method gives only the name
of species; the natural method alone gives the name and the relations of species.
An artificial method may conduct to names, even while placing in approxima-
tion objects the most dissimilar, and for the very reason that it gives only the
name of objects. Thus the connections not being consecutive, the artificial
method is not of a logical order. That method is alone logical in which species
the most similar are placed beside one another, and species the most unlike are
furthest removed from one another. Each group therein has the greatest possible
number of common properties. And if the groups are contained one in another,
if we ascend from one to others by a series of propositions more and more gen-
eral, we possess the science entire. But what are the means for arriving at this
logical or natural method? These means are of two orders: rational or empirical.

“An organized being is a whole; its different parts, therefore, have necessary
relations to one another. Now, the more important any part, that is to say, the
more essential by the order of its functions, the more do its modifications involve
corresponding ones in all the rest. Every thing, therefore, consists in knowing
the relative importance of the parts, and in subordinating one to the other in the
method, as they are subordinated in the organization itself. In this resides the
whole rational principle of method. Thus, the nervous centres, the brain, the
spinal marrow, by which the animal is essentially what it is, give the first groups
of the method; the respiratory and circulatory centres, the lungs, the heart, by
means of which it partakes of its present life, give the second ; the digestive cen-
tres, by which it sustains that life, give the third, and so on in succession.

The naturalists have only succeeded by long tentatives in conducting the dis-
tribution of animals to the point of perfection which it has reached; they have
arrived at that point a posteriori; they might have arrived at it a priori, by
the direct determination* of the relative importance of the organs. Now, so far
as the relative importance of the organs is known, we have a rational method; a
method @ priori. When the relative importance of the organs is not known, we
are guided by their constancy ; we have then only a method a@ posteriori, an em-
pirical method. The most constant organ is regarded as the most tmporlant ;
the constancy of arelation, taken as a fact, supplies the reason of that relation,
until that reason is known.

Thus, for example, all ruminating animals have the foot cloven; all animals
which have horns, ruminate, &e. ‘These are constant relations, but what is the
reason of this constancy? We know it not. And yet, since these relations are
constant, we may employ them, with confidence, in our methods. Again, insects
which breathe by means of trachee, are deficient in conglomerate and compact
glands. Their secretory organs are only canals or simple tubes. We know at
present the reason of this fact. It is because animals which respire by tracheee
have no circulation, and there needs a circulation to make the blood penetrate
into conglomerate and compact glands. But before the reason of the fact was
known, the fact itself was known; it was shown to be constant; and from the
very circumstance of its being constant, it might thenceforth be employed in
method. Constancy, therefore, represents importance.

Thus, there are two kinds of method, or, to speak with more exactness, there

* Direct determination, which is only obtained through physiology. And herein, as has been
already said, is the true secret of the great results obtained by M. Cuvier. It was because
his vast genius embraced all—anatomy, physiology, zoolugy ; and made each of those sciences
co-operate in turn to the progress of the others.
HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER. 143

are, for method, two distinct states: the rational and the empirical. And as
method is always bound to be natural, when, in order to become so, it has no
longer the rational way, it becomes so by the empirical way ; when it has no longer
the known importance of the organs to direct it, it is guided by their constancy.

II.—CLASSIFICATION OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.

* * * Linneus divided the animal kingdom into six classes : quadrupeds,
birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, and worms. No precise limit circumscribed these classes
in which the cetacea were found among the fishes ; the cartilaginous fishes among
the reptiles ; the crustacea, the articulated worms, animals which have a true
circulation, were ranged among the insects which have none ; ; and the intestinal
worms, the polypes, ‘the infusoria, the mollusks, even certain fishes were united
and confounded in the class vermes, the last and most chaotic of all. * *
Into this class, in effect, Linnzeus had introduced endless confusion, and Bru-
guiéres left it just as Linnzeus had done. So little attention was still paid to the
internal organization of these animals that the last-named author, for example,
taking for tnollusks all that had no shell, separates from the class in question,
under the name of testacea, all that have a shell, asif the slight external character
of havinga shell hindered the testacea from being true mollusks by virtue of their
entire nature or internal organization.

It was in 1795 that M. Cuvier pointed out the extreme difference of the objects
confounded in this class, and separated them distinctly, one from another, after a
detailed examination and agreeably to characters derived from their organization

itself. This examination produced a new general distribution of animals with
white blood into six classes, mollusks, crustaceans, worms, insects, echinoderms,
and zoophytes. From this new distribution of the white-blooded animals dates
the revolution of zoology.

Still later M. Cuvier associated the crustaceans with the insects, on account of
the common symmetry of their parts, and the articulated structure, alike common,
of their members and body ; he separated the annelids, or worms with red blood,
from the intestinal worms ; for he pointed out that the former have a true circu-
lation, a distinct nervous system, an articulated body, while the others have
neither circulation nor distinct nervous system, nor body properly articulated.
He showed that the mollusks, which have so rich an organization, a brain, eyes,
often very complex, sometimes ears, always numerous secretory glands, a double
circulation, &c., should in the first place be raised greatly above “the polypes and
other zoophy tes, the greater part of which have not even distinct organs, and
with which, nev ertheless s, they had been so long ranged ; and, in the next place,
that the collective assemblage of these mollusks formed a group which, by the
importance of its general characters and the number of species which compose it,
corresponds not to such or such a class or fraction of the vertebrate animals, but
toall the vertebrata joined together ; and then, taking up each of the great masses
ot the animal kingdom, he saw that scarcely any of the general divisions there-
tofore admitted could be sustained, at least with the characters and limits which
had been thus far assigned to them. or instance, it was customary to oppose
the vertebrate animals to the animals without vertebre, as if these two divisions
had been of the same rank; and to designate equally by the name of class the
whole of the mollusks and a mere fraction of the vé ertebrata, as if, in effect, the
whole body of mollusks was only equivalent to a fraction or subdivision of the
vertebrata, &e. Now, since the infinitely varied organization of the animals
without vertebree was at last known, it was impossible any longer to pretend that
there was not, between all these varied animals, vastly more difference than
between certain vertebrates and certain others. But if, of these two divisions,
one comprised structures far more varied than the other, the one could not be
equivalent to the other; they were not of the same rank; they should not then
144 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

be called by the same name. In like manner, since the organization of the
mollusks had become known, it could no longer be pretended that there were
not between these animals many more differences than between the animals of
a single class of vertebrata; and consequently again, since there was no parity
between the beings comprised in these two divisions, there was no parity of division,
and there ought, therefore, to be no parity of name.

But this was not all. By still comparing the structures, and taking them for
a guide, it was not less evident that the erwstaceans united to the insects, and these
two groups to that of the worms with red blood, or annelids, formed by their
importance, by the number of their species, by their structures so essentially diverse,
a third division, similar either to that of the vertebrata or to that of the mollusks ;
and that all other animals, united thenceforth under the name of zoophytes, formed
a fourth division similar to each of the three preceding. Considered under this
new point of view the animal kingdom presents therefore four grand divisions or
branches: that of the vertebrata, that of the molluscas, that of the articulata,
and that of the zoophyta.

Each of these divisions is formed on a particular and distinct plan; that is to
say, one which cannot be reduced to that of the others; and they are all like
one another in being of the same order ; that is to say, that the beings they include
present, in their structure, similar or equivalent resemblances or differences.
Thus the vertebrata have their plan, the mollusks have theirs, the articulata,
the zoophytes have theirs, and all these plans are alike circumscribed ; that is to

say, that no shading, no intermediary, no lien, can make them pass from one to
the other without a rupture, withouta'saltus. A kind of cir cumvallation separates
them. We can pass by modifications more or less graduated from man, con-
sidered in his organization to the other mammifers, from mammifers to birds,
from birds to reptiles, from reptiles to fishes; but from fishes to mollusks, from
mollusks to articulata, from articulata to zoophytes, there is no longer any grad-
ation or natural transition. All at once the plan changes and a new form shows
itself; but taken in itself this new form, this new type, is equally constant, preva-
lent, uniform; all the mollusks repeat as exactly their own type as the vertebrata,
the articulata, the zoophytes, repeat theirs. ‘Thus, in the immense chain of the
animal kingdom there are four great forms, four grand types, and there are but
four.

This capital fact is equally worthy of note whether we consider it as showing
that, with the exception of a few secondary modifications, all animals enter exactly
into one or the other of these great forms, or whether we consider it as showing
that between each of these great forms there is no shading, no gradation, no
intermediate form. The vertebrata alone havea spinal marrow, a long medallar Vv
cone, into the sides of which enter the nerves, and which is enlarged at its ante-
rior extremity to form the encephalon; they alone have a double nervous system,
that of the spinal marrow and that of the great sympathetic; they alone have a
canal composed of bony or cartilaginous vertebree. But all of them have this
spinal marrow, this great sympathetic, these vertebre; all have senses to the
number of five, horizontal jaws to the number of two, red blood, a muscular heart,
a system of chyliferous and absorbent vessels, a liver, a spleen, a pancreas, kid-
neys, &c. In a word, the more we examine their whole organization the more
resemblances do we discover.

But the more differences do we also find as regards the other embranchments.
The mollusks, for example, have also a brain, though infinitely reduced; but
they have no spinal marrow, and consequently no vertebrae ; they have no oreat
sy mpathetie, and their single nervous sy stem, instead of being placed hace the
digestiv e canal, as in the vertebrate animals, is always placed, wil the exception
of the single ganglion which represents the brain, ‘below that canal, being con-
signed to the viscera; In fine, they have neither a true skeleton nor absorbent
vessels, nor spleen, nor pancreas, nor vena-porta, nor kidneys ; the organ of smell

.
HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER. 145

is wanting in all; that of sight in many; asingle family possesses that of hearing,
&c., but they all have a complete and double system of circulation, circumscribed
respiratory organs, a liver, &c. In a word, if, by the want of a spinal marrow,
of vertebrae, of a skeleton, a great sympathetic, &e., they differ essentially from
the vertebrates, they seem, ee the richness of their vital organs, by their double
circulation, their respiration, their liver, &c., to come immediately after them, and
hence to deserve to form the second of the four branches of the animal kingdom.

The third, or that of the articuata, differs not less from that of the mollusks
than these differ from the vertebrata. The animals of this branch have a small
brain like the mollusks, and this small brain is also situated upon the cesophagus ;
but, what is wanting in the mollusks, they have a sort of spinal marrow com-
posed of two cords which run along the belly and unite themselves with it from
space to space by knots or ¢ anglions from which issue the nerves; and yet this
spinal marrow, which distinguishes them from the mollusks, does not associate
them with the vertebrates, for, inversely as regards that of the vertebrates, always
placed above the digestive canal, it is always placed below. By an opposite
inversion the heart, which is below this canal in the vertebrata, is above in the
articulata; and what I have just said of their spinal marrow may be said of their
skeleton, when they have one; itis that this skeleton, while it divorces them
from the mollusks, is not a feature which unites them with the vertebrates ; for,
inversely to that of the vertebrates, which is internal and covered by the muscles,
it is external and covers the muscles. Again, in a word, the features which sepa-
rate the articulata from the mollusks are essential and profound, and such as decide
the nature cf beings, and the features which seem to connect them with the
vertebrates do so only in appearance.

The fourth branch presents characters not less circumscribed, not less deter-
minate than the others. The first of these characters is that ali the parts are
disposed around a centre, like the radii of a circle; the second is the degrada-
tion, the successive simplification of their structure. From the first character is
derived the name of radiata, or animals of which all the parts are radiate or

stellate; and from the second that of zoophytes, or animal plants, animals which,
in the simplicity of their organization, approach most nearly to plants. Thus
the animal kingdom has four great types or forms, and a little consideration will
disclose that each of these general forms of the body depends on the form itself
of the dominant system of “the animal economy; that is, on the nervous system.

The vertebrate animals have a trunk on each side of which all their parts are
Una eae y arranged ; it is because their nervous system forms a central med-
ullary cone, from each side of which proceed, in symmetrical order, the nerves of
ali those parts. The mollusks have a mass-like body; it is because their nervous
system has but a confused arrangement. ‘'T’o the body of the articulata some
degree.of symmetry is restored, but it had been first impressed on their nervous
system ; the body is articulated externally, for the nervous system is articulated
in the interior ; - in fine, even in the radiaied animals, whenever the last vestiges
of the nervous ’ system are distinguishable it presents that star-like form which is
affected by the whole body.

The form of the nervous system, then, determines the form of the animal;
and the reason of this is simple : it is that, on the whole, the nervous system is
virtually the animal, and all the other systems are present only for its service
and sustentation. It is in nowise surprising, therefore, that, the form of this sys-
tem remaining the same for each enbranchment of the animal w orld, the gen-
eral form of each should remain the same; nor that, this form changing from ona
embranchment to another, the form of each embranchment should change.

‘she egeaitenes Cy gst thus seen that the modifications of the nervous system g vive
the first groups, the first divisions or embranchments, it follows from the principle
of subordination of characters, which is but another expression for the subordi-
nation of the organs themselves, that the modifications of the organs of circula-

10s
146 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

tion and respiration, which come immediately after the nervous system in the
order of their importance, will give the first subdivisions, or the classes. The
vertebrate animals present either a simple and complete respiration, with a dou-
ble circulation, which is the case with the mammifers; or a double respiration
and double circulation, which is the case with birds; or a simple respiration, but
complete one, since it is always aerial, and this combined with a simple circula-
tion, being the case of reptiles; or a double circulation, combined with an incom-
plete, that is to say an aquatic, respiration, which is the case with fishes. Hence
the vertebrate animals are distributed, according to their organs of circulation
and respiration combined, into four classes—the mammifers, *pirds, reptiles, and
fishes.

So it is, also, with the mollusks; some have three hearts, others two, others
one: of these hearts there are such as have but a single ventricle and a single
auricle; others a single ventricle and two auricles; others, again, a single ven-
tricle without an auricle, &c.; in fine, certain mollusks respire by a pulmonary
cavity, others by branchie, &e.; ; and it will be readily conceived that the com-
bination of all these variations of respiratory and circulatory organs will furnish
classes of mollusks as it farnished the classes of vertebrata. The classes of
mollusks, thus determined, are six in number—cephalopods, gasteropods, acephalates,
Gs brachiopods, and cirrhopods.

‘The combination of the organs under consideration will give us, likewise, and
in even a still more striking manner, the subdivision of the third branch
into four classes: the annelids, whose blood is red like that of the vertebrata;
the crustacea, whose blood is white like that of all other animals without verte-
bree, and which, moreover, have a heart placed in the back, &c.; the arachnids,
which have for heart only a simple dorsal vessel which sends forth arterial branches
and receives venous ones; and insects, which have no vessels at all, neither
arteries nor veins, which have only the vestige of a heart, and whose respiration
is not effected by circumscribed organs, but by trachee, or elastic vessels distrib
uted through the whole body. In this branch of the articulata we observe,
therefore, the transition from’ animals which have a circulation to those which
have none, and the corresponding transition from those which respire by means
of circumscribed branchiz to those in which trachez distribute the air to every
part.

It is in the fourth branch, or that of zooph ytes, or the radiata, that we
observe the disappearance, the gradual and successive fusion of all the organs
into the general mass. ‘Thus, some of these animals have still closed vessels,
distinct organs of respiration, &c.; others, which have neither such vessels. for
circulation nor such organs for respiration, have still visible intestines; it is only
in the last of ali that everything seems reduced to a homogeneous pulp; and it
is on the different degrees of comptication in their structure that is founded their
subdivision into five classes: echinoderms, intestinal worms, gees pol YPS,
and infusoria. - - %* 7 *

Thus the nervous system has furnished the branches ; the organs of cireu-
lation and respiration combined, the classes ; and it is easy to conceivethat organs
more and more subordinate w ould successively supply the orders, the families,
the tribes, the genera, the sub-genera, in a word, the whole scaffolding of the
method. ‘Thus as regards the mammals, for instance, (for it would detain us too
long to follow the unfolding of the method in all the classes ,) the combined
organs of touch and of manducation divide this class into nine orders : man, who
has three sorts of teeth, (molar, canine, and incisive,) and who has the opposable
thumb on the two anterior extremities alone; the quadr umana, which have also
the three sorts of teeth, and, moreover, the opposable thumb on the four extrem-
ities ; the carnivora, which again have the three sorts of teeth, but no opposable
thumb and consequently no hands, which have only /eet, but feet of which the
digits or toes are movable, like those of the two above orders; the rodents, whose

.
HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER 147

toes differ little from those of the carnivora, but which have only two sorts of
teeth, the molar and incisive ; the edentata, in which order the toes have become
less movable, and are almost confounded with large claws, and which have never
any teeth but the molar and canine, sometimes only , molar, and sometimes none
at all; the marsupials, or animals with a pouch, a small series collateral to the
three preceding orders, some of them corresponding to the carnivora, others to the
rodentia, and others to the edentata; the raminants, which form a strikingly dis-
tinct order in view of their cloven ‘feet, their upper jaws without true incisors,
their four stomachs; the pachydermata, which comprise all the other quadrupeds
with hoofs; and mae cetacea, which are wholly destitute of posterior extremities.

The principal medifications of the combined organs of touch and manducation
having given the orders, secondary modifications of these same organs will sup-
ply the families ; and modifications more and more subordinated will give all the
other groups, the tribes, the genera, the sub-genera, until we finally reach the
species for which the whole scaffolding is constructed.

Thus, to confine ourselves again to a single order of the mammifers, that of the
carnivora, for example, it has just been seen that one of tlfe characters of that
order is to have movable toes. Now, if we suppose these toes to have become
very long, and to be united by membranes, so as to form an organ of flight, as
in the bats, we shall have the family of cheiroptera ; if we suppose that the
animal, the toes remaining free, supports itself in w alking on the entire sole of
the foot, or, on the contrary, that it walks only on the ends of its toes, we shall
have in the first case the tribe of the plantigrades, and in the second that of the
digitigrades. And similarly as regards the organs of manducation, it has been
seen that this order has three sorts of teeth, and it is this which constitutes its
character as an order ; but let us suppose that the molar teeth (which by their _
form always decide the diet of the animal) ave feeble and furnished with conic
points, and we shall have the family of insectivora ; or that these same teeth
have become stronger, and, instead of simple conic points, are armed with parts
more or less incisive, ‘and we shall in that case have the family of carnivora ;
and in this latter fainily, according as the molar teeth are entirely cutting or
incisive, or more or less mingled with blunt tubercles, we shall have either the
genus bear, of which almost all the teeth are tubercular ; or that of dogs, which
have only two tubercular; or that of cats, &c., which have none tubercular, and
which consequently are exclusively carnivorous, while the dog is capable of re-
ceiving a certain amount of vegetable nourishment, and the bear may be entirely
nourished on vegetable food. And herein lies one of the necessary relations
between the organs which enables us to calculate with considerable certainty the
proportions of the alimentary canal, from the extent of the tubercular surface of
the teeth of animals, compared with the cutting or incisive surface.

What has been here said might be easily exemplified as regards all other
families, tribes, and genera; and it will hence be seen that the simple placing of
an animal ih one of these g groups, teaches us as exactly as the most detailed
description, all that relates to the organization of that animal, or to the degree
of organization which corresponds to the group in which it is placed. Let me be
told, “for instance, of some creature that its place is in the genus cat, and I shall
at once conclude not only that its molar tee th are all sharp or incisive, as beg
a cat, but further, that it has three sorts of teeth, movable toes, &c., as being car-
nivorous; that it "has a double circulation and a complete respiration, as being
a mammal ; that it has, also, a spinal marrow, a canal composed of vertebrae,
five senses, &c., as being one of the vertebrata. Thus I shall know the whole of
its organization ‘from its “place alone, and what will remain for ‘me to say of it
will, of course, be reduced to a few words, for the indication of its proper or
specific characters.

Now, as the number of known beings is immense, and, immense as it is, can- -
not fail to be much more augmented, we perceive the : ad vantage of being able
148 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

thus to substitute a few words for a complete description; of having to say nothing
of each species but what is proper to it; of being able to suj pply, by its place
alone, all that it has in common w ith all the rest of the kingdom ; but we also
perceive that, for method to afford this advantage, it is necessary ‘both that all
its groups should be rigorously subordinated among one another, and that each
of them should comprise only beings of the same structure,

Groups well constituted, alone admit of general propositions. Without gen-
eral propositions there can be no method; without method no brevity; the high-
est merit of all science in which the number of facts is immense, as it is In every
branch of the history of the beings of nature. A genus, a family, an order, ill-
constituted, stands in the way of every general proposition relating to that genus,
family, or order. Thus, by placing the stven and the cel in the same genus,
Gmelin rendered it impos ssible to say anything general upon that genus ; by
placing the cudtle-fish and the fresh-water polyp in the same order, he made it
impossible to say anything general upon that order ; and by placing the mol-
lusks, the wor ms, and the zoopha ytes in the saine class, Tinnseus had rendered every
gener ral proposition relative to that class impossible, &c.

By means of well-constituted groups, then, we are enabled to say, at one time,
for all the species they contain, what it would have been necessary, otherwise, to
repeat as many times as there had been species remaining dispersed and detached.
But, among all these groups, and under the pomt of view with which I am here
concerned, “the genera have an importance which is proper to themselves. It is,
that being the first approximation of species, all the rest of the scaffolding is, so to
Say, founded upon them, and an ill-constructed genus would suffice to break the
unity of a family, of an order, of an entire class. Besides, being nearer to the
species, the more they shall combine only such species as are conformable with
one another, the less there will remain to oy for each of them; and it is herein
that may be seen a]! the inconvenience of those large genera, into which, even
of late, so many incongruous species have been thrust, and all the advantage of
intersecting those genera by sub gencra—a happy expedient which forestalls con-
fusion, by” approximating in a closer manner the species which present resem-
blances more particular or more intimate. * is i * a ~

But all this work of genera, sub-genera, &c., of which we have been speak-
ing, supposes a work not less ‘consider ‘able, the positive establishment, namely,
of species—a point in w hich the animal king dom presented not less confusion
than in all the others. It was not sufficient to have remodelled or created almost
all the divisions of that kingdom ; it was incumbent on M. Cuvier to revise all
the species, to revise them one by one, and even their synonyms; for sometimes
several were confounded under the same name, sometimes a single one passed,
under different names, for several; and this criticism of so many names, imposed
right or wrong, on such a number of species, was assuredly neither the part of
the work which offered least difficulty to the author, nor that which has saved
his successors least embarrassment. It suffices, in effect, to cast the eyes on the
works upon natural history which have appeared since the first edition of the
Regne animal, to see the happy fruits which have resulted from these labors
upon synonyms of which I now speak, and that art of establishing divisions in
the comprehensive genera of which I had been previously speaking,

T have said, with reference to branches, and again with reference to classes,
that each of these groups is definitely circumscribed ; as much may be said of all
other groups in every degree. Linnzeus had pronounced that “nature makes no
leaps;” and Bonnet, that “the chain of beings is but one continuous line.” ‘The
very reverse of these propositions would be much more exact. The truth is , that
the different groups are separated from one another by intervals more or less
marked and profoand ; and there is, in the very organization of the animals, an
evident reason for all these intervals.

The organization of an animal is only, in effect, a certain combination of organs;
HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER. 149

but all combinations of organs are not possible. For example, a stomach of one
of the carnivora necessarily supposes incisive teeth for rending its prey, movable
toes for seizing it, &c. ; for a like reason, animals with hoofs are, of necessity, all
herbivorous, because their immovable toes would not allow of their seizing a ‘liv-
ing prey—their molar teeth, with a flat crown, could not tear it, &c. There is a
necessary harmony, therefore, which regulates the combination of or gans ; there
are such as exclude one another, such as necessitate one another, so that al comn-
binations are not possible; and it necessarily follows, if only from the fact that
all combinations of organs are not possible, that there must be certain gaps, cer-
tain chasms between the possible combinations and the impossible, or between
different groups of creatures; and that this sort of hiatus is determined by the
laws or conditions under which these creatures exist.

The first edition of the Régne animal (which itself sueceeded the Tableau
élémentaire de Vhistoire naturelle des animaux, wherein the first germs of Cuvier’s
ideas on classification had been developed) occupied but four volumes, the second
five; of which the last two, relating to the crustaceans, the arachnids, and the
imsects, were the work of M. Latreille, who, as M. Cuvier himself pronounced,
had, ‘of all the men of Europe, studied those animals the most profoundly.”
Jt may well be supposed that a work of the nature of that of which we speak, a
work which, on its appearance, became at once the guide of all zoologists, would
be translated into all languages. It was so, in effect, into English, by M. Grif-
fith; into Italian, by the Abbé Ranzani; and into German, by M. Schinz.

III.—NATURAL HISTORY OF FISHES.*

This work may be considered under two distinct relations: under that of the
great number of new species with which it has enriched zoology, and under that
of the application which the author has therein made of the empirical laws of
method to a definite class of the animal kingdom. I shall say but a few words
on the work considered under the former point of view, which would adapt itself
but little to the philosophical studies which I have in hand.

Aristotle knew and named 117 kinds of fish ; Pliny knew but 95 or 96; Oppian
names 125; Athenzeus, 130; Adlian, 110; Ausonius names tor the first time the
salmon-trout, the common trout, the barbel and some other fresh-water fishes.
In all, the ancients had distinguished and named 150 species of fish ; only about
40, therefore, had escaped the research of Aristotle; and, as regards the structure
of these animals, nothing was added to what he had said. In the middle of the
16th century Rondelet, ‘Belon, and Salviani make their appearance; the three
original authors who founded ichthyology. Belon describes and names about 13
fishes; Salviani, 99; Rondelet, 244, of which 197 belong to the sea and 47 to
fresh water. Neglecting some ’ secondary authors, if we come to Ray and Wil-
loughby, we find the number of known fishes already more than 400; the same
is nearly the case with Artedi and Linneeus ; there are about 1,400 in "Bloch and
Lacépéde; there are nearly 5,000 in the work of M. Cuvier. * * * #*
But to come at once to the philosophic al part of the work under consideration,
we proceed to the distribution of species, or rather to the views which have guided
the author in that distribution. Aristotle had recognized that the true characters
of fishes consist in the branchie (gills) and in the jfivs. The class of fishes is
composed, therefore, of vertebrate animals with these appendages; the features
common to all being the vertebra, or, more exactly, an inter mal skeleton, (for
the vertebrae do not alone compose that skeleton,) the branchi@ and the fins.
The differential features are an osseous or a cartilaginous skeleton; gills, now
Tree, now fixed; fins, soft or spinous; ventral fins placed by turns before, behind,

* The first volume appeared in 1828; 8 of the 20 volumes, which the work was intended to
comprise, were published before Cuvier’s death, and several others have since made their
appearance through the care of M. Valenciennes, the coadjutor of Cuvier for the entire work.
150 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

or under the pectoral; teeth placed by turns on the intermazillaries, the maxillaries,
the vomer, the palatine, the tongue, the arches of the branchia, &c.; the
form of these teeth, plate-like, villiform, pointed, &e. ; the opercula or covers of the
branchie, whether smooth, scaly, serrated, sharp-pointed, and armed with spines,
or obtuse and without spines, &e.; and it is on the varied combination of
these differential features or characters that all the different methods which have
been successively imagined for the classification of fishes depend.

It will be readily understcod that he who should employ but one or two of
these characters would have only an artificial or incomplete nethod, like Linnzeus;
that he who should indistinctly employ them all would have only a confused
method, like so many ichthyologists, and that the xatwral method—that is to say,
the exact and complete one—consists at once in employing them all, and in
employing none but according to the relative order of its importance. ‘There are
two points, in effect, which control the whole idea of a natural method: one to
employ only true characters ; the other to accord to each of these characters only
the precise degree of its importance. But, to employ only true characters—that is
to say, not to attribute to such or such a species such or such a character which
it wants, and, reciprocally, not to suppose it destitute of such or such another
which it possesses—we perceive that it is necessary to know all the species. On
the other hand, to attribute to each character only the degree of its importance,
we perceive that this complete knowledge of species, in itself so vast and so diffi-
cult, still would not suffice, and that it is, moreover, necessary to have compared
these characters under all their relations; that it is necessary to have varied, multi-
plied, exhausted all their coml nations.

Now, on these two points which constitute, in fact, the whole of ichthyology—
that is to say, both for the determination of species and the valuation of the
characters according to which those species are composed or discriminated up to
the time of M. Cuvier—everything was yet to be done. The species of fishes
were not known; the proof of it is in every page of the book we are considering.
No just idea existed of the characters which decide their union or distribution,
the proof of which is found in those perpetual transpositions undergone by the
same species in the different classifications of authors. is i ‘3

IV.—LECTURES ON COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.*—LAWS OF ANIMAL ORGAN-
IZATION.

Two great laws control and comprise all the others; the first is that of organic
correlations ; the second that of the subordination of organs.

A necessary correlation binds all the functions one to another. Respiration,
when executed in a circumscribed respiratory organ, cannot dispense with circu-
lation, for it is necessary that the blood should arrive at the respiratory organ,
the organ which receives the air, and it is the circulation which carries it thither ;
circulation cannot dispense with irritability, for it is irritability which deter-
mines the contraction of the heart, and consequently the movements of the blood ;
muscular irritability, in turn, cannot dispense with the nervous action. And if
one of these things is changed, it is necessary that all the others should change.
Tf circulation is wanting, the respiration can no longer be circumscribed ; it is
necessary that it should become general, asin insects; the blood no longer seek-
ing the air, it is necessary that the air should seek the blood.

‘There are organic conditions, therefore, which call for one another; there are
such as exclude one another. A circumscribed respiration necessarily demands
a pulmonary circulation; a general respiration renders a pulmonary circulation
useless, and excludes it. Liverything is thus regulated by necessary relations.

* Two volumes of this work appeared in 1800, three more in 1805. In the former, M.
Cuvier had for his coadjutor M. Duméril; in the latter series he was assisted by M. Duvernoy,
who is publishing at the present time a second edition of the entire work.

HAISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER. 152

The mode of respiration is in constant dependence on the circulation, which car-
ries the blood to the air, or to the organ which receives the air; the force of the
movements is in constant dependence on the quantity of the respiration, for it is
respiration which restores to the muscular fibre its exhausted irritability.

The quantity of respiration everywhere determines the vigor, the rapidity, and
the kind of movement. The movement which requires most muscular energy is
that of flying, and the bird has a double respiration. The mammal has move-
ments more limited, and it has a simple respiration. The reptile has movements
more feeble still, and it has but an incomplete respiration. ‘The bird respires
not alone by its lungs, but by its whole body. The air, after having traversed
the lungs, which are transpierced like a sieve, penetrates into the cellules of the
abdomen, into the cavities of the bones, &c. It is, therefore, not alone the blood
of the lungs, but the blood of the whole body, which respires. The mammal has
but a simple respiration, for there is but the blood of its lungs which respires ;
but this simple respiration is complete, for all the blood of the body passes
through the lungs before returning to the members. Finally, the reptiles have
but an incomplete respiration ; their pulmonary circulation is only a fraction of
the general circulation ; there is but a part of their blood which respires, or
which, returning from the members to the heart, passes from the heart to the
lungs before returning to the members. Hence, the reptiles have only cold blood,
only slow movements, interrupted by long repose; they are all subject to hiber-
nating torpor, &c. On the other hand, fish have a complete pulmonary circu-
lation ; but they have only an aquatic respiration, that is to say, an imperfec
one, since they have, for respiring, only the small quantity ef air contained in the
water ; quite the contrary of what has been just said of reptiles, which have an
aerial or per fect respiration, and an incomplete pulmonary circulation.

Now, these two things are mutually compensatory : an aerial or perfect respi-

ration is compensated by an incomplete pulmonary circulation, and a complete
pulmonary circulation by an aquatic or imperfect respiration. Tish, therefore,
have only cold blood, like the reptiles—only movements which require littlo
muscular energy, &c. Thus, there are in vertebrate animals four definite degrees
of respiration : the complex respiration of birds, the simple but complete respi-
ration of mammals, and the incomplete respiration, incomplete by two different
means, of reptiles and fishes. And there are four kinds of mov ements which
correspond to these four degrees of respiration: the flight of the bird, which cor-
responds to the duplicate respiration ; the step, the leap, the run of mammals,
which correspond to the complete, but single respiration; the crawling of the
reptile, a movement by which the animal ‘does no more than drag itself along
the earth; and the swimming of the fish, a movement for which the animal hag
need of being sustained in a liquid, the specific gravity of which is nearly equa!
toitsown. And as of movement, so too of digestion. The greater the capacity
of respiration, the more rapid he digestion. ‘The most r apid digestion is that
of the bird, the slowest that of the reptile; the bird surprises us by ‘the frequency
of its repasts, the reptile by the duration of its abstinences.

Ev erything i in the bird is formed for flight. It required a wing of wide sur-
face to strike the air; ; for this wing large muscles were needed to move it; these
muscles required very large bones for their insertion. And the bird has a sternum
developed into a salient Dl: ade, into a crest, it has a pectoral muscle re ‘latively
enormous, &c. So much for the exterior; internally, it has a duplicate respira-
tion, an animal heat and muscular energy which correspond to that respiration ;
and, for this duplicate respiration, it has lungs perforated like a sieve, air cells,
which are the appendix of its lungs, &e. Nor did all this sutlice ; my own exper-
iments have shown that the brain is composed of three parts essentially
distinct :* the cerebrum, exclusive seat of intelligence; the cerebellum, seat of the

*See my Recherches expérimentales sur les propriétés et les fonctions du sysiéme nerveut,
&c. Second edition, Paris, 1842. -
152 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

principle which governs or co-ordinates the movements of locomotion; the
medulla oblongata, seat of the principle which controls the movements of respira-
tion. Now, in the bird, the part of the brain which, relatively to the brain of
other vertebrate animals, predominates, is precisely that which governs or co-ordi-
nates the movements of locomotion; itis the cerebellum. All the parts, all the
functions, all the modifications of the parts and of the functions, are therefore
formed each for the others, and all for a given purpose.

We have seen this as regards respiration, as regards the act of flying, &c. It
is easily shown as regards digestion. 'The system of an animal is, in effect, by
no means an arbitrary thing. It is not by hazard that incisive teeth coincide
with a single stomach; flat and dull teeth witha multiple stomach ; flat teeth,
a multiple stomach, with a herbivorous diet, &c. A single one of those things,
necessarily supposes all the others, or excludes them all. An animal with long
intestines, a multiple stomach, flat teeth, is necessarily herbivorous. A carniy-
orous animal has, necessarily, incisive teeth, a single stomach, short intestines ;
it has, moreover, and just as necessarily, divided and movable digits, to seize its
prey; and, even in the brain, it has a peculiar instinct which impels it to nour-
ish itself on flesh. Never will such an instinct nor an incisive tooth co-exist in
the same animal, with a foot enveloped in horn, for these things are incompatible
and contradict one another; the animal in which they presented themselves
together could not subsist. The laws of organic correlations, properly viewed,
are the very conditions of the existence of beings.

After the law of organic correlations, comes, as we have said, the law of the
subordination of organs. A recognized subordination everywhere subjects cer-
tain organs to others: the organs of locomotion to those of digestion ; the organs
of circulation to those of respiration ; all functions and all organs to the nervous"
system. Circulation, for stance, does or does not exist, according as respira-
tion is conducted in such or such a manner. All animals with a circumscribed
respiration (the vertebrata, the mollusks, the erustacea, &c.,) have, necessarily,
a circulation; for it is necessary that the blood should arrive in the organ which
receives the air, and it is the circulation which carries it thither. The insects,
in place of a circumscribed respiration, have a general respiration, executed by
means of trachee, which carry the air everywhere; in their case, there was no
need of ¢irculation, and there is none.

The same subordination connects the organs of locomotion or of prehension with
the digestion. And such is the force of this subordination that one of these organs
seems incapable of making any progress without manifesting a similar progress
in the other. ‘Thus, for example, the ruminant animals have, in general, neither
canine nor incisive teeth in the upper jaw, and there are but five bones to their
tarsus ; the camel has canines, and even two or four incisives in the upper jaw,
and already we observe an additional bone in the tarsus, because the scaphoid is
here not consolidated with the cudoid ; further, the common ruminants have, for
the whole fibula, only a small bone articulated at the base of the tibia, and the
chevrotain or moschus, which has canines well developed, has a distinct and
complete fibula, &c.

V.—COMPARATIVE OSTEOLOGY.

This branch of science, sprung from the labors of Daubenton, of Camper, of
Pallas, has become, in the hands of M. Cuvier, a new instrument; it was by
comparative osteology that he reconstructed the lost species of ancient worlds;
and it is well worthy of remark thai in this long and laborious series of researches
and efforts none of these learned men ever diverged from the domain of positive
facts. Such, effectively, is the empire of these facts over the human mind that,
except in their default, it scarcely ever throws itself into the domain of con-
jecture and lypothesis. In almost every line it is only when the facts are not

-
HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER. 153

known, or begin to be exhausted, that recourse is had to systems; and what is
unfortunate for the history of science is not the mania of systems, which prevails
before the acquisition of facts, but that which seeks to reproduce itself afterwards.

The great work of M. Cuvier on fossil bones shows that there is not a single
bone, a single part of a bone, of which the study is not valuable, necessary, often
indispensable, for the distinction of fossil species from existing species. This
work seems everywhere a living proof of the saying of a celebrated writer, that
never, except in the profound study of details, have the secrets of nature been
surprised; and it cannot be observed without pain that while there remain to
be discovered any of those facts of which the least circumstances possess such
an importance, so many authors turn away from this curious and solid research
for so many other researches as vain as they are idle; these, for example, choosing
to discover, in any event, all the parts in each; the entire body in the head, the
members in the jaws, the thorax in the nose, &c., those, making by turns the
pieces of an apparatus pass into another, in order thus to arrive at a unity of
number which this overturning of everything does not itself yield them. 'The
object of M. Cuvier, it may easily be conceived, was not to follow the authors in
question into these researches, more hardy than philosophic ; he nowhere pretends
to find in an apparatus either representations of parts foreign to that apparatus,
or constant numbers of pieces or bones, but he seeks how far the correspondence
of these pieces goes and where it stops.

At no epoch has it been possible to compare the different beings which compose
the animal kingdom without remarking, at the same time, their resemblances and
their differences, and the difficulty has never been other than to fix the precise
limit between the analogies which constitute, on the one hand, the characters
more or less general of species, and the differences which, on the other, constitute
their characters more or less distinctive and peculiar. Hence arise two branches
of the same study, which both date from the first ages of science; one the search
for analogies, the other the search for differences. Now, it is readily conceivable
that, according to the epoch, such or such of these researches should appear more
or less important in relation to the other; but, at bottom, it is easy to see that
one always supposes the other, and that it is neither the evident analogies nor
evident dissimilitudes which could ever have been the subject of serious discus-
sion, but, in truth, the real differences hidden under apparent analogies, or
inversely, the analogies hidden underdifferences. In a word, as it is impossible
to mark the point where dissimilarity commences without marking that where
analogy ceases, it would be impossible to carry the study of differences as far
as M. Cuvier has done without recognizing the point where the analogies com-
mence ; and perhaps it was necessary, in effect, to exhaust first the study of differ-
ences in order to be sure of allowing no analogies afterwards to stand but suck
as are real and incontestable.

However this may be, the profound sentiment that an immense analogy, o«
rather that analogies of all kinds bind together more or less all the beings of the
animal kingdom, is a sentiment which, as | have just said, dates from the first
ages of science. The whole work of Aristotle bears on the conformity of the
different species with one another, and of all with man, taken as a common term
of comparison. Buffon wonders at the constant uniformity of design, and asks
if this latent resemblance be not more surprising than the apparent differences
(Histoire de Pame). Daubenton points out the conformity of structure in the
greater part of the skeleton, and particularly in the foot—that is to say, the part
of the skeleton which varies the most (Description du cheval). Camper, in two
ingenious discourses,* dilates on the astonishing analogy between the structure

* Discours sur Vanalogie qwil y a entre la structure du corps humain et celle des quadru-
pédes, &c.—Belon, before Camper, by placing vertically the skeleton of a bird, had rendered
conspicuous a multitude of relations tillthen unnoticed, with the human skeleton. Histoire

of the human body and that of quadrupeds, birds, and fishes, and shows how, by
gradual changes from a horizontal to a vertical attitude, it is possible “ to trans-
form a cow intoa bird, a quadruped into aman, &c.” Finally this striking idea
is seen pervading the writings of Vicq-d’Azyr, who says that “ naturescems always
to work after a primitive and general pattern, from which she deviates only with
reluctance; that we observe everywhere those two characters which seem impressed
on all beings, that of constancy in the type and variety in the modifications.” *

Nevertheless, this opinion of a constant uniformity of design, of an astonishing
analogy, of a primitive and general patiern, rested as yet only on a perception
vague and more or less confused. And it is in our own times alone that this
complicated question of the analogy of structure has been disentangled and
divided; that it has adopted as a field of discussion determinate and precise
facts; that, become a positive question, it is capable of being discussed in a
rigorous and detailed manner.

“This question has been termed the question of wnity of organization; it might
quite as well have been termed the question of variety of organization ; all depends
in effect on the point of view under which it is considered; for since there are
different species of animals, unity here supposes necessarily a certain variety ;
and since, on the other hand, these different species all resemble one another,
at least on that common ground which consigns them to the same kingdom, it is

‘evident that this variety necessarily supposes also a certain unity or conformity.
The true title of the question, or rather its trne object, was therefore the deter-
mination of the limits where stop, by turns, the resemblances and differences in
the organization of animals; an organization at once so similar and so varied.
Once divided, as I have just said, the question has taken quite another aspect.
The general resemblance of animals has been no longer concluded from sone
particular resemblances, nor limited to certain branches, to certain classes. An
regards the osseous system, for example, it had been presently perceived that,
only pertaining to vertebrate animals, this system can only yield results limited
to that embranchment, to that type. The resemblances of the osseous system
which testify so strongly to a common ground-plan, to a unity of structure, testify
to them, therefore, only in reference to the sole type which possesses an osseous
system, the type of vertebrates.

Considered collectively, the osseous system forms the skeleton, which is
divided into several parts: the apparatus of the vertebree, that of the cranium,
those of the face, of the ear, of the hyoide, of the opercula, of the ribs, of the
sternum, of the shoulder, of the pelvis, of the limbs. Now, there is not a mem-
ber of this diversified apparatus which does not, in the different classes, vary in
the form, the numbet, the complication of the pieces which constitute it. For
the most part, and saving the variations just spoken of, they are reproduced in
all. ‘lhere are, however, some which are wanting in such and such a class ;
there are some which are the exclusive attribute of a single one. ‘The question
is to see what is the particular character of each apparatus in each class; that is
to say, of what pieces it is there composed, what there is the form and the com-
bination of those pieces. Now, such an examination shows that, among all these
parts of which the skeleton is composed, some are essential, and hence more con-
stant; others accessory, and hence more variable; that the vertebrae, the cra-
nium, which lodge the spinal marrow, the encephalon, may readily vary from one
class to another in the number and form of their bones, but are found in all;
that, on the contrary, the ossicles of the ear, the opercula, the limbs, &c., all
accessory and subordinate parts, may be wanting, and are so in effect, when the
conditions of audition, of respiration, of locomotion, are no longer the same.
These are analogies, then, graduated like the importance of the parts which pre-
sent them; each part has its proper limits, both of variety and analogy; each
should be studied apart; and it might hence be said that there is a particular

comparative osteology of each osseous apparatus, as there is a general compara-
tive osteology of the whole system.

The cranium, that most complicated apparatus of the skeleton, presents, in
all mammifers, a composition very nearly the same; we may there follow each
bone, from man to the quadrumana, from the quadrumana to the carnivora, to the
rodentia, to the edentata, the pachydermata, the ruminants, the cetacea; every-
where are recognized frontals, parietals, occipitals, temporals, the sphenoid, the
ethmoid; and they are everywhere recognized as well by their position as their
use. It is as much if the interparietals appear to be wanting in certain species.
It is the same with the face. The bones of the nose, of the cheek, of the jaws,
of the palate, &c., are never wanting. ‘The lachrymals alone fail in the phoce,
the dolphins, &e. All other differences of number are but apparent, and result
only from the greater or less promptness with which, according to the species,
the bones or parts of bones, constantly separated in the first stage of life, unite
and are confounded in adult age. It is thus that, according to the species, the
occipital, the parietal, the sphenoid, the temporal, &c., appear sometimes single,
sometimes donble, triple, or quadruple ; but when we recur to the foetus the occi-
pital is always divided into four parts, the parietal into two, or rather into four,
counting the inter-parietals, which, in the end, constantly become united there-
with, the temporal into four, the body of the sphenoid intv two, &e. Thus, in
the mammals, there isa normal number for the bones of the cranium; and when
this number appears masked by the obliteration of the sutures in the adult state,
the primitive division is always reproduced and restored in the foetal state; and
what I say of the bones of the eranium may be said also of the bones of the
face, and of their more numerous subdivisions in the earlier stages.

It would naturally be curious to see whether this singular analogy was main-
tained in the other classes, in the birds, the reptiles, the fish; whether the same
number of bones is there everywhere reproduced ; whether, masked in the adult
state, it would appear in the foetal; whether, in fine, reptiles and fish, in which
the bones of the cranium are always much more numerous, could be ‘regarded as
corresponding in this respect to the early age of birds and mammals. ‘This
interesting question was successively treated by M. Cuvier in reference to rep-
tiles (Reserches sur les ossemens fossiles, tome 5,) and to fish (Histoire naturelle
des poissons ;) it will suffice to indicate here the manner in which he has resolved
‘it relative to reptiles. i

The reptile whose head presents the most striking traits of conformity with
that of the mammifers is the crocodile; from the crocodile M. Cuvier passes in
succession to the tortoises, the lizards, the serpents, and finishes with the batra-
chians, which conduct from reptiles to fish, as the crocodile from reptiles to mam-
mals. The head of the crocodile is composed of a much greater number of
bones than that of the adult mammifer, but by recurring to the foetus of this
last class we recognize in the head of the crocodile and that of the mammifer
very nearly the same number of bones. ‘Thus M. Cuvier, after having found in
the crocodile, and in the same place as in the mammals, the intermaxillary
bones, the maxillary, the nasal, the lachrymal, the jugal, the palatine, the ethmoid,*
the body of the sphenvid, the parietal, finds also, and again in the same place,
the occipital, but divided into four parts, as it is in the foetus of mammals, the
ereat wings of the sphenoid, vestiges of its lesser wings, its internal and external
pterygoid wings, but all these parts separate from the body of the bone, as they
all are, except the last,t in the mammal at its earliest age; finally a temporal

{ For this reason M. Cuvier gives the special name of transverse bone to the external ptery-
goid apophysis, which, in the mammals, is not at any age effectually separated from the
great temporal wing. It is, therefore, not properly a new bone, but a dismemberment of
the sphenvid, as the frontal bones, anterior and postetior, are dismemberments of the frontal.
156 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

bone, but composed of four bones, as it is in the foetal mammals, the squamosal,
the mastoid, the cavity of thetympanum, and the petrous bone. There remained
only the bones which “correspond to the frontal to reduce to analogy, but these
bones are six in number in the crocodile, and asthe frontal of mammifers is never
divided but into two, M. Cuvier was obliged to admit here a peculiar dismem-
berment of this bone, a dismemberment which, in the crocodile, or, to speak more
generally, in the greater part of oviparous vertebrates, subdivides each of the
two frontals of mammals into three others, the principal, the anterior, and the
posterior frontals.

This determination of the bones of the head of the crocodile, compared with
those of the head of mammals, being once established, it is easy to reter to it, as
a sort of type, the bones of the head of all other reptiles, particularly tortoises,
lizards, and serpents. ‘Thus, with due regard to the differences of form and pro-
portion, the greater part of the bones of the crocodile reappear in the head of the
tortoise ; but this head wants the nasal bones , which are here represented only
by cartilaginous laminze, the transverse or external pterygoid and the lachrymal
bones. Moreover, the parietal, which is single in the crocodile, i is double in the
tortoise ; but in the lizards this parietal again becomes single, the lachrymal and
transverse bones reappear, anew bone is disclosed which M. Cuvier calls columella,
&c.; all but slight differences, which do not hinder us from recognizing throughout
the predominance of one same plan in the heads of the crocodile, the tortoise,
and the lizard.

A new and more difficult study commences with the batrachians. First, the
general composition of the head is singularly simplified. We find here only the
two lateral occipitals, with neither upper occipital nor basilar; a single phew
with neither temporal nor orbital wings; a single bone replaces _ at once the
principal frontal and the ethmoid ; there are no posterior frontals, but there are
two anterior frontals, two parietals, and two petrous bones. Nor is the face less
simplified, for the transverse forms only one with the pterygoid, the temporal but
one with the tympanic, and there is no mastoid. ‘The cranium of the frog, there-
fore, has but 10 bones, one ethmoid, two frontals, two parietals, two occipitals,
one sphenoid, two petrous bones; its face has but 16, two intermaxillars, two
maxillars, two nasals, two palatines, two vomers, two pterye goids, two tympanics,
and two jugals or zygomatics. In ally its head hes but 26 bones . while that of the
crocodile has nearly 40. And this difference of number presents itself in each par-
ticular apparatus of the face; thus the lower jaw of the crocodile has six bones
on each side, and each side of the j jaw of the frog has but three, &c.

IT have said that the apparatus of the vertebre is, with that of the cranium, the
most constant; each vertebra may itself be considered as a small distinct appa-
ratus, composed of a certain number of bones, which is not the same for all the
vertebree in each species, nor for each vertebra in all the species; the atlas of
the crocodile has six bones, its axis has five; the atlas of the tortoise has only
four, that of the monitor three, &c. But it is chiefly by their total number that
the vertebree vary from one class to the other, and even in the different orders,
the different genera of each class. Not to depart here from the reptiles, the
crocodile, for example, has 26 vertebree—7 cervical, 12 dorsal, 5 lumbar, and 2
sacral; 200 are counted in the adder, the boa, &c.; the frog has but nine. As
recards other apparatus of the animal system, "being only accessory, the greater
part may be wanting, and is wanting, in effect, in such or such a class, such or
such an order, such or such a venus, &c. The hinder extremities fail in the
cetacea, both the anterior and posterior extremities in the serpent, the ribs are
absent in the frog, the auricular apparatus in fishes, &e.

Nothing is better calculated to give a just idea of the manner in which a certain
general conformity i is combined in certain cases with all the variations of detail
than what is seen in the shoulderand the sternum. The shoulder, which is com-
posed, in the mammifer, of but one bone, the scapula, or of, two, the scapula and

2
HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER. 157

the clavicle, has always three in the bird: the scapula or omoplate, the clavicle,
and the coracoid bone; it has only two in the crocodile, the scapula, and the
coracoid, the true clavicle being wanting ; the three bones reappear in the lizards;
there are two in the tortoise, the scapula and coracoid, or perhaps three, for there
are traces of a clavicle ; there are certainly four in the frog, the clavicle, ’ coracoid,
and an omoplate, divided into two pieces; and, what is remarkable, it is precisely
of these two pieces of the omoplate that the shoulder of fishes is composed. The
sternum in the crocodile is a single hone; in the tortoise it is always composed
of nine pieces; it recovers in the lizard the simplicity which itexhibits in the croco-
dile; it has but two ossified pieces in the frog; a sort of sternum is hardly dis-
coverable in certain fishes; inthe mammals, onthe contrary, it is highly developed;
here we count as many as seven, eight, nine pieces, placed ordinarily on a single
line; and as to birds, there are five pieces in the gallinacea; there are not more
than two in ducks; its composition is again changed i in pigeons, in sparrows, in
birds of prey, &c. Thus the sternum not only varies from one class to another,
it varies in the same class, and that in the very class of birds where, in general,
unity or conformity of organization is so constant and conspicuous.

But, in reference to this question of osteological unity in vertebrate animals,
there are two apparatus which have a peculiar importance : : these are the auricular
and the hyoid apparatus. By the auricular apparatus we here designate a chain
of small bones, placed within the tympanum of the ear, and which extends from
its membrane to the fenestra ovalis. In the mammals we count always four
of these small bones, the malleus, the incus, the lenticular, and the stapes; in
the birds we find but one, formed of two branches, one of which adheres to the
tympanum, the other presses upon the fenestra ovalis; in like manner a single
ossicle replaces, in the crocodile, the four small bones of the ear of mammals ; i
is a stapes still more simple than that of birds; * there is but a single ossicle in
the tortoise, the lizard, the serpent; in the frog, the auricular chain might be pro-
nounced somewhat complex did it not remain in great part cartilaginous ; lastly,
in the salamanders, the sirens, the protei, the Tast auditory ossicle itself, the
stapes, is reduced to a simple cartilaginous plate. From this to the complex
apparatus of the mammals is certainly a wide interval, and when we thus follow
step by step this successive simplification, when we arrive thus at that final
reduction of the whole apparatus to a simple cartilaginous plate, we recognize
the full force of M. Cuvier’s opinion that this apparatus, after having dis appeared
in the aerial vertebrates, is not all at once restored in the class of fishes, there to
form the opercula, and that these opercula are consequently a special apparatus
appropriate to this latter class.

‘The facts which concern the inverse progression of the hyoid apparatus, that is
tosay, its gradual development from the mammals to fishes, are still more import-
ant, and, in relation to theories of the skeleton, more decisive. In man this appa-
ratus is composed of five parts: of a body, of two branches or anterior processes
which suspend the hyoid to the cranium, and of two posterior ones which suspend
the larynx to the hyoid. Even in the mammals the apparatus undergoes great
modifications, depending on the form of its body, the soldering of this fo the pos-
terior branches more or less promptly, the number, shape, and proportion of the
anterior branches. In birds these anterior branches are no longer attached to
the craninm, but simply pass around and behind it; to the back part of the body
of the bone i is soldered a single slender bone, oii which rests the larynx, and
which, in itself alone, represents the two posterior branches; in front is another
borie which penetrates into the tongue, being the lingual bone.

The hyoid of the crocodile is one of the most simple. lts body consists of ¢ a

*We might, in truth, give the name of malleus to that branch which in birds and croco-
diles is inserted in the membrane of the tympanum, but still there would be neither tncus nor
lenticular ossicle.
158 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

thick and broad cartilaginous plate, without any very distinct vestige of the pos-
terior branches, and a single ossified piece, representing the anterior branches.
The hyoid of lizards is much more complex, and that of the tortoise even more
so than that of the lizard. * * * But it is in the batrachians, chiefly, that
the hyoid acquires importance, and thus leads by degrees to the hyoid of fishes,

so rich and complicated. To explain this richness of the hyoid apparatus in
fish, recourse had been had to a pretended intercalation which has taken place

of pieces borrowed at once from the sternum, the larynx, and the ribs. It will
be perceived that the metamorphosis of the frog, which, in its first period, respires
by bronchiee or gills, like the fish, which at a mares period respires by lungs, like
the land animals, and the bronchial apparatus of which changes by degrees,
and visibly, into a true hyoid, should have settled all difficulty. in this respect.
M. Cuvier, therefore, made this singular metamorphosis a detailed study; he
followed it in its w hole progress ; he saw the branchiew and branchial arches sue-
cessively fall; he saw the proper hyoid of the adult frog take shape proportion-
ably; and at no time, even at that of the greatest complication, when the bran-
chial arches and the branchi existed, neither did the sternum nor the larynx
take, nor could they take, any part in this whole composition; for the branchial
apparatus still very distinctly exists, with all its parts, which are clearly to be
seen, as well as the larynx, with its dependent lungs, and the sternum, with
the bones which rest against it. The hvoid of the salamander is metamorphosed
like that of the frog, and the branchial apparatus, in the same way, still very
distinctly subsists, although the larynx, the lungs, and the sternum, are also pres-
ent; and all this acquires new force from what is observed so plainly in the
axolotl, the proteus, the siren, animals in which the branchial apparatus exists
sithultaneously, and in a constant manner, with the larynx, the tracheal artery,
&c. The branchial apparatus is, therefore, only a more complex hyoidian appa-
ratus, and not one resulting from the combination of parts foreign to it, and
derived from neighboring organs.

Each apparatus has, therefore, its proper constitution ; it has its marked inere-
ments and decrements; its parts change from one class to another in form, in
number, in complexity ; and it is these very changes which determine the organic
characters of classes, of orders, of genera, of species. What, then, must be
understood by anity, or, to speak more exactly, by conformity of organization,
by conformity of plan, in the vertebrate animals, at least in what regards their
osseous system, if not an assemblage of graduated analogies, more constant in
the essential apparatus, more variable in the acc eSsOry, and of which the limit
cannot be given, for each apparatus, except by the direct and consecutive study
of all the modifications of that apparatus, in all the classes? Now this consecu-
tive study of an apparatus through all the classes, and of all the graduated mod-
ifications which it undergoes from one class to another, is precisely what consti-
tutes the most distinctive feature of Cuvier’s method, and the pomt which ought
perhaps most to fix the attention of right-minded inquirers; for it is on the rig-
orous and special adaptation of the method to its object, that depends the exact-
ness of the results. Now, what is here the question? Of following, of recog-
nizing an apparatus through all its metamorphoses of number, of form, of com-
plication of parts. And is it not plain that to lose sight of a single intermedi-
ate metamorphosis would suffice to render impossible all recognition of those
which follow, would be to lose the thread which connects one with the other, nay,
to lose the apparatus itself? 'The principle of successive and graduated modifi-

cations, employed by M. Cuvier, is one, then, of the most fruitful as well as most
ingenious means of investigation with which he has enriched science, and the
only one which can give, in a sure and precise manner, both the determination
of each apparatus, and the limit of its analogies or its dissimilarities in each class

VI.—RESEARCHES ON FOSSIL BONES.*

The first object of this work is the comparison of fossil with living species ;
and this comparison bears principally on two classes of vertebrate animals: maim-
mals and reptiles. The author commences this comparative history of the
species of the ancient and the actual world, with the pachydermata ; he contin-
ues it with the ruminants, the carnivora, the rodenti: a, the edentata, and the ceta-
cea; and concludes with the reptiles. The fund: amental result of the whole
work is, that no fossil species, or scarcely any, at least in the two classes of mam-
mifers and reptiles, has its analogue among living species. It has been already
said that to arrive at this result, it was necessary that the author should review
all the fossil species, that he should compare them all, and one by one, with all
the living species, and it has been shown to what precise, rigorous, and almost
infaliible laws he has subjected the admirable art of reconstructing all thes:
lost species from their scattered remains. I shall apply myself here chiefly +4
another point: that of the particular and detailed comparison of fossil with exist-
ing species.

I begin, as M. Cuvier hae done, with the pachydermata. This family, natural
as it is, was almost entirely overlooked by Linnzeus. Storr, who had clearer
conceptions of it, characterizes it by this definition: mammals with hoofs with
more then two toes. But without speaking of the anoplotherium, a fossil species
which has only two toes, and which is not the less a true pachyderm, it is
evident, from a consideration of the whole structure, that the solipeds should be
united to the ordinary pachydermata. The number of the toes, therefore, can
no more be taken into consideration in this family than in the others. Cuvier
defines it: animals with hoofs, non-ruminants. Before him, the order or family
of pachydermata comprised but five genera: the elephant, the rhinoceros, the
hippopotamus, the tapir, and the hog. M. Cuvier introduced into it two other
genera, the horse and the daman. * * * Considered in their relations to the
revolutions of the globe, the fossil pachydermata form two groups: the pachy-
dermata of loose and alluvial formations, and those of the plaster quarries, so
abundantly accumulated in the epvirons of Paris. To the former pertain the
fossil elephant, mastodon, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, horse, &c.; to the second,
the palzotherium, the anoplotherium, the lophiodon, the anthracotherium, the
cheropotamus, the adapis. All the species of the first of these two groups are
now lost; but the greater part of its genera subsists. Not so with the second,
in which both genera and species are equally extinct. * * * Beginning
with the pachydermata of loose and alluvial formations, the first of these animals
which M. Cuvier studied under this new point of view, of the comparison of
fossil with living species, was the elephant.

Till then, almost everything relative to this singular quadruped was alike
unknown. It was not known, at least with any precision, whether there was
only a single species of elephant or several species, nor, with stronger reason,
whether the fossil bones might be referred or not to the living species. The first
truly specific distinction of these animals, that which is founded on the structure
of their molar teeth, only goes back to Camper. Blumenbach had also seen this
difference in the form and number of the laminee of the molar teeth, which dis-
tinguishes the elephant of Africa from that of the Indies; but so far this was
all, and it is to Cuvier that we owe the determination of all the other differ-
ences, derived from the bones of the skull, from those of the face, and of the

*The first edition of this great work, published in 1812, was scarcely more than the
reunion of the memoirs, inserted successively by the author, in the Annales du Muséum
Whistoire naturelle. The second edition appeared from 1812 to 1824. It is nut only enriched
with a great number of new facts, but the entire work is recast throughout, and arranged in
more methodical order. The third edition is of 1828, and is distinguished from the second
by certain additions to the Introduction, which latter has been olten printed separately, and
has become celebrated under the title of Discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe.
160 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

entire skeleton. He shows that it is from these bones, especially those of the
skull, as well as from their teeth, ears, &c., that the two living species, that of
Africa and that of India, are distinguished from each other; thus the species of
India has the head long, the forehead flat, or even concave, while that of Africa
has the head round and forehead convex; the former has the lamine of its molar
teeth in the form of wavy or festooned ribands; in the latter these lamine are
lozenge-shaped; this last has larger ears and tusks, &c. As to the fossil species
or mammoth of Russia, it is essentially distinguished from the two living species,
and in particular from the species of India, to which, however, it is most nearly
allied, by its molars, the laminz of which are closerand straighter, by the alveoli
of its tusks, which are longer, by its lower jaw, which is more obtuse, &c.;
finally, the entire individual, discovered in 1806, on the coast of Siberia, has
taught us that it had two sorts of hair, a reddish, coarse, and tufted wool, and
long, black and stiff hairs.* To this it may be added that the bones of this
last species are never found but in a fossil state, and that, on the contrary, the
bones of the other two species are never found in that state. The fossil is, theve-
fore, a lost species. Further, its bones, dispersed through almost all the coun-
tries of the world, are always found in the same strata as those of the mastodon,
the rhinoceros, and the hippopotamus. All these species, then, are of the same
epoch, and are all alike extinct. Among them the species which approaches
nearest to the elephant is the mastodon; it was of the same general form, had
feet of the same structure, a proboscis, and long tusks; yet these were essential
differences, as well from these tusks being curved in the opposite direction to
those of the elephant as from the circumstance that the molar teeth, instead of
being formed of transverse laminz, presented a simple corona well furnished
with tubercular or mamillated prominences. The mastodon is the largest of
fossil animals, yet Danbenton fell into the error of referring a part of its bones
to the elephant and another part to the hippopotamus. W. Hunter pointed out
that the mastodon differs sensibly from both those animals. Camper showed
that it more closely approximated to the first than to the second. Finally, M.
Cuvier has completely demonstrated that the mastodon was neither elephant
nor hippopotamus, and that, though nearer to the former, it is essentially distin-
guished from it by its jaw-teeth; and that not only as regards species but genus.
That genus itself already comprises as many as six species, of which the most
’ celebrated is the great mastodon or animal of the Ohio, which has left its bones
only in North America. Another species, long confounded with the latter, has

been distinguished from it by M. Cuvier; this was the mastodon with narrow
tecth, the bones of which are found in both continents. Of four other species,
two pertained to America and two to Europe. The genus of elephants showed
us but one species destroyed; the entire genus of mastodons has perished.

The genus hippopotamus, which, so far, is known to possess but one living
species, numbers already several fossil species. The first or largest, and the only
one regarding which some imperfect notions were entertained before M. Cuvier,
differed nearly as much from the living species as the fossil elephant from living
elephants. A second, the small fossil hippopotamus, differed much more. The
others are as yet little known. The bones of the hippopotamus accompany, in
many places, those of elephants and mastodons, but they are much more rare ;
the upper Val @’Arno is hitherto the only site where they have been found in any
abundance.

After the genus hippopotamus comes that of the rhinoceros. Here, as with
the rest, the osteology and the distinction of living species are always the two
points of comparison to which the whole study of fossil bones and species refers

*'The bones which were shown at Paris, towards the commencement of the 17th century,
as being the bones of King Teutobochus, and which were the subject of a long controversy
between Habicot and Riolan, arenow at the museum. They are not those of an elephant, as
Riolan thought, but of the mastodon.

itself. We know at present four living species of the rhinoceros. The first is
the rhinoceros bicornis, of the Cape, which has molars, but no incisors; the see-
ond is the rhinoceros wnicornis, of the Indies, which has incisors separated from
the molars by a vacant space; the third, the rhinoceros of Sumatra, appears to
form, as it were, an intermediate species between the two preceding, for it has
two horns like the rhinoceros of the Cape, and incisors like that of India. The
fourth is the rhinoceros unicornis of Java. ‘Thus, there are four living species ;
two having one horn, two having a second horn. ‘The number of fossil species
is not clearly established. ‘The most celebrated, that whose nostrils are sepa-
rated by a bony partition, is found in Siberia, and in different parts of Ger-
many. The second, that whose nostrils are not separated by a bone, has been
thus far found only in Italy. Both species had two horns, and both appear to
have wanted incisors. As to other species, to the number of two or three, they
are as yet indicated only by a few fragments. It was to the species with parti-
tioned nostrils that the entire rhinoceros, withdrawn in 1770 from the ice on the
banks of the Wilhoui, belonged. This rhinoceros was covered with a thick coat
of hair, much like the fossil elephant, which seems to prove that both could live
at the north. “Thus,” savs M. Cuvier, “the cold countries which surround the
pole must have had, at the epoch which preceded the last revolution of the globe,
the great pachydermata, as they have now the great ruminants; the musk-ox, the
bison, the elk, the Canadian stag, the reindeer, the great carnivora, the white bear,
the morse, and so many large seals.”

We know, as yet, only the lower jaw of the elasmotherium, a fossil genus of
Siberia, discovered by M. Fischer, a genus entirely lost, like the mastodon, and
which, to judge from this jaw, must, in form and stature, have approximated to
the rhinoceros. ‘The genus equus has left a great number of its bones, mingled
with those of the elephant and rhinoceros; but there has been thus far no osteo-
logical difference observed between these fossil species and the living species;
and what is not less singular is, that none has been found, at least none sufh-
ciently fixed and decided to be really characteristic, between the different living
species of this genus: the horse, the ass, the zebra, the quagga, &c. The bones

.of the hog have not yet been discovered in any strata so old as those of the fos-
sil elephant, horse, and rhinoceros. M. Cuvier gives, however, the osteology of
this genus, for his work has two objects equally important: the determination of
fossil species, and the elements and means of this determination; that is to say,
the general laws of comparative osteology. Thus, it is only to establish this
great assemblage of osteological facts and laws that he gives the description of
the daman, for neither have the remains of this animal been found among fossil
bones. The daman, a small animal of Africa and Arabia, passed for a rodent.
M. Cuvier shows that it is a true pachyderm, and the one, indeed, which of all
others, approaches nearest to the rhinoceros. A genus not less singular than
that of the daman, and the osteology of which was not less unknown, is that of
the ¢apirs. 'Vhese number at present three living species: two of America and
one of the Indies; and M. Cuvier describes several fossil animals related to the
tapirs.*

The elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the mastodon, &c., as here
described, were the pachydermata of the alluvial formations. We see that all
their species are distinct from the living species; that they are all lost, and that
they were all destroyed at the same epoch and by the same catastrophe ; for their
bones are found in the same deposits, everywhere united and mingled together.
‘Lhe fossil pachydermata which we are about to consider are all of another epoch,
and one much more remote; arid nearly all of these were discovered by M.
Cuvier, in those plaster-quarries of Paris, which have thence become so celebra-

* As regards his gigantic tapir, we now know that it is a very different animal from the
tapirs. This great tapir of M. Cuvier is the Deinotherium giganteum, the head of which has
been made known to us by MM. de Klipstein and Kaup. M. Cuvier scarcely knew any
part of it but the molar teeth.

162 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER.

ted; they are the palcotherium, the anoplotherium, the cheropotamus, the adapis.
The bones of all these genera— most of which ‘nende several species — were
mingled and confounded together. It was necessary to begin by separating them;
it was necessary, then, to assign each bone to its species, and finally to recon-
struct the entire skeleton from each of them ; and it was here that the method
devised by the author for this reconstruction was exhibited in all its efficacy.

In regard to fossil species, the tecth are always the first part to be studied,
and the most important, for it is from the teeth that it must be determined
whether the animal was carnivorous or herbivorous, and even, in some cases, to
what particular order of such animals it pertained. M. Cuvier then having
re-established the complete series of teeth which were found to be most common
among those which he had collected, soon saw that they proceeded from two dif-
ferent. species, of which one was provided with prominent canine teeth, and which
the other wanted. The restitution of the teeth thus gave two species of pachy-
dermata: the one with prominent canines, being the paleotherium; the other,
without them, or with a continuous series of teeth, the anoplotheriwm. Further,
this restitution of itself showed, in each of these species, the type of a new
genus; two genera related to he tapir and rhinoceros, but two genera entirely
lest; for no living pachyderm reproduces, even generically, their dental system.
And such, on the other hand, was the rigor of the zoological laws followed by
the author, that the teeth having given him two distinet genera, it could not be
doubted that all the other parts of the skeleton, the he: ad, trunk, feet, all min-
gled indiscriminately with one another and with these teeth, would be also of
two different genera. He at once foresaw, therefore, for Ascth of these genera,
a head, a trunk, feet of a particular form, as he had found for them an appro-
priate dental system ; and he was not long in finding all that he had foreseen.

The teeth being re-established, the restitution of the heads claimed his atten-
tion, and it was soon evident that these also were of two genera. Next to the
teeth and head, the feet are the most characteristic part ‘of the skeleton, and
their restitution gave likewise two genera. It remained, therefore, only to refer

each foot to its head, and each head to its dental system. Now, the restitution
of the hind feet had shown them to be of two kinds, some with three toes, others
only two; and the restitution of the fore feet had yielded the same result. A-vail-
ing himself, by turns, of the general analogy of the species which he reproduced
with the nearest living species, and of the particular relations of proportion
and size of the different paris in question, one with another, M. Cuvier first
united the hind feet with two toes to the fore feet with two, and repeated the
process with those having three; and always guided by the same analogy, the
same relations, he united the former with the dental system which was destitute
of prominent canines, and the latter with the dental system which had them.
He thus united in succession, for each genus, all the bones of the head, the trunk,
the extremities; he reproduced, finally, the entire skeleton, and scarcely was
this great labor terminated when, by a singular hazard, a nearly complete skele-
ton of one of them, found at Pantin, came to confirm all the results which had
been obtained. In this skeleton, so fortunately discovered, all the bones were
united together as M. Cuvier had united them; nature having acted no other-
wise than. the admirable laws discerned by him and his own w ronderful sagacity
had acted.

A first species of each genus being in this manner reconstructed, their number
was not slow in aug ementing. M. Cuvier soon counted five species of anoplothe-
rivums, and not less than 11 or 12 paleotheriums. All the former are from the
environsof Paris; the most common was of the size of the ass; another of that of
the hoe; a third, of that of the gazelle; a fourth, of that of the hare ; a fifth was
still smaller. Among the palaotheriums there were, at Paris alone, seven species;
one the size of the hort, one of the tapir, one of the sheep, one of the hare, &c;
another species discovered near Orleans, nearly equalled in size the rhinoceros.

s
HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER. 163

The palzotherium which, at Paris, always accompanies the anoplotherium, is
accompanied almost everywhere else by another genus not less remarkable, and
which, by a singular exception, is absolutely wi anting at Paris, the lophiodon.
This new genus, “also approximated greatly to the tapirs, like the paleeotherium
and anoplotherium ; i is, like these last, entirely lost, and like them, already rich
in species. M. Cuvier has made known a dozen, all of France. The genus
cheropotamus and the genus adapis number each but one species. The genus
anthracotheriwun numbers tw 0, one of which approached the rhinoceros in size.
The two former genera are of the environs of Paris; the third was first found
near Savona, and afterwards in Alsace and Velay.

With these numerous pachydermata, first among terrestrial mammals to
occupy the earth, M. Cuvier collected the remains of carnivora of the genus of
the dog, the genet, the raccoon, &c.; a bat of the genus vespertilio; a species of
didelphys; two rodents, one pertaining to the dormouse, the other to the squirrel ;
‘six species of birds, relics of the crocodile, the trionyx, the emys, and certain
species of fresh- water fish. But to restrict ourselves to the pachydermata which
form, beyond comparison, the most important part of this antique animal colo-
nization of the globe, we have nearly 40 species and five genera totally lost;
and what is not less ‘noticeable, none of their species are found mingled with
those of the elephant and the mastodon. 'The two classes of animals: belonged
therefore to two essentially distinct ages.

To the pachydermata succeeded, in M. Cuvier’s investigations, the ruminants.
It is only in the alluvial formations that the bones of these abound, and here
two genera especially show themselves in great number: the stag and the ox.
* * * It isin the caverns of Germany, England, France, Ke. that the fos-
sil remains of the carnivora especially abound. ” After having extricated the liv-
ing species of these animals from the confusion which had thus far attended their
determination, M. Cuvier proceeds to describe the fossil species—four species of
pears: that of the caves, the most numerous of all, the arctoid bear, the inter-
mediate bear, the bear with flattened teeth; a hyena, almost as abundant as
that of the bears, which is most so; two tigers, a wolf, a mouffet, two weasels,
a glutton, &c. The fossil rodentia are not numerous. The oreat beds of the
loose formations have yielded hitherto but one large species of the beav er, called
by M. Fischer the trogontheriwm. The bone breccia gives two species ‘of the
lagomys, two of the rabbit, of the field mouse, the rat, &e.

The order of the edentata has two fossil, but gigantic species: the megalonyz,
of the size of the largest ox, and the megatherium, of that of the largest rhi-
noceros. These two enormous species are from America. An unguiculate
phalanx, found in a canton of the Palatinate, not far from the Rhine, indicates
a third species related to the pangolin, and quite as gigantic as the two others.

So much for the inhabitants of the land formations. The cetacea all pertain
to strata essentially marine. Here, with the cetacea, occur the amphibious mam-
mals, the seal and the walruss. A first group of these marine mammals, whose
osteology and living species themselves were then so little known, preceded all
the terrestrial mammals. Their remains disclosed to M. Cuvier bones of the
dolphin, the lamantin or manatee, and the walruss. A second group had suc-
ceeded the palezotheriums; and among them M. Cuvier recognized a dolphin, a
whale, and an entire genus wholly lost, the ziphius, related to the sperm whales
and hyperoodons.

We come now to the reptiles. M. Cuvier considers in succession the crocodiles,
tortoises, lizards, batrachians, and concludes with the extraordinary family of
the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus. The fossil crocodiles are very numerous,
M. Cuvier having described as many as fifteen species. The fossil tortoises are
even more numerous still, from sixteen to seventeen species having been already
discriminated ; among them, several of the drionyx, several of the emys, or the
tortoise of fresh water, several of the chelonia, or tortoises of the sea, and some
164 HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER

terrestrial tortoises. The order of batrachians has but one fosst species: the
gigantic salamander of Giningen, or the pretended fossil man—the homo diluvit
testis of Scheuchzer. The order of reptiles which presents the most extra-
ordinary fossil species is that of the saurians. In the first place, most of them
were gigantic. A first species, the great saurian of Manheim — the lacerta gigantea
of Semmering, the geosaurus of M. Cuvier—was twelve or thirteen Yeet in
length; a second, the mosasaurus, the great saurian of the quarries of Maes-
tricht, long taken for a crocodile, was more than twenty-four; and a third, truly
gigantic, the megalosaurus, was more than seventy. Here, then, we have a liz-
ard which surpassed the largest crocodiles, and in size even approached the
whale. This, it is known, was discovered by Dr. Buckland, in the oolitic beds
of Stonesfield, near Oxford. M. Cuvier further makes known some remains of
the fossil monitors of Thuringia, of a great saurian at Honfleur, of a gigantic
saurian in the quarries of Caen, &c.

The genus of pterodactyls, or flying lizards, though not remarkable for its
size, is eminently so for its singular structure : a very short tail, a neck very long,
a bird’s beak, a finger of the anterior extremity prodigiously elongated, and thus -
elongated to support a sort of wing. ‘There are two species of pterodactyls:
one of the size of a bat, the other rather larger. It is needless to add that the
genus is wholly extinct. But something still more strange in point of structure,
is that presented by two other genera of saurians, both likewise extinct: the
ichthyosaurus and plesiosaurus; the former uniting at once the snout of a dol-
phin, the teeth of a crocodile, the head and sternum of a lizard, paws of the
cetacea, but to the number of four, and the vertebre of a fish; the latter join-
ing to these paws the head of a lizard, and a neck of such inordinate length that
more than thirty vertebre are counted therein. Both these extraordinary animals
were found for the first time in England, but have since been discovered in Ger-
many and France. The discovery of the first of these genera was due to Sir
Everard Home; that of the last to Mr. Conybeare. Already four species of
the ichthyosaurus are known, and five of the plesiosaurus.

These reptiles, so numerous and so varied, crocodiles, tortoises, the vast sal-
amander, the strange or gigantic saurians, joined with crustacea, mollusks, zoo-
phlytes, fishes, marine mamials formed the first animal colonists which occu-
pied the globe; the second were those of the epoch of the paleeotherium; the
third, those of the epoch of the mastodon; the fourth are those of the actual
epoch. Without counting the last, there have been three distinct eras of animal
life: that of the reptiles, that of the paleotheriums, that of the mastodons; and
after each successive family of living beings, the sea has returned to repossess
itself of the land, retreating afterwards in favor of a new order of creatures;
for marine strata constantly sueceed to the terrestrial strata, and animals which
have lived in the sea constantly succeed to animals which have lived on dry land.

Such is the assemblage of fossil species, reconstructed by M. Cuvier. We
have seen the precise laws on which this reconstruction is founded. The high-
est of these laws is the principle of the correlation of forms; a principle by means
of which we are.enabled, to a certain point, to determine from each part all the
others; for each part has a necessary relation to all the others, and all to each.
Thus, and to cite again a new example of this great law of organic correlations,
the form of the teeth, and even, in certain cases, the form of a single tooth, gives
that of the condyle of the jaw; the form of this condyle gives that of the
glenoid cavity which receives it; this condyle, this cavity, give the zygomatic
arch, the temporal foss, in which the muscles are attached which move the jaw.
The form of all these parts, that is to say, the mode of manducation, gives the
stomach, the intestines, that is to say, the mode of digestion; this again gives the
mode of prehension, or the form of the feet; for if the animal is herbivorous, it
has no need of the feet except to support its body, it will suffice for it to have
hoofs; and if it is carnivorous, it will necessarily require, on the contrary, divided
fect, that is to say digits for seizing its prey and tearing it.
HISTORY OF THE WORKS OF CUVIER. 165

By proceeding thus from one part to another, we apprehend the relations which
bind each of them, first to that which follows, and then nearer and nearer to all
the others, even to the most remote, without the chain of relations being ever
at any part broken or detached. From each part, and even in appearance the
most insignificant part, we may therefore infer all the others, and the entire
animal itself.

For example: that claw of the pangolin, found in the Palatinate, huge as it
is, demonstrates of itself a lost species; and from this claw alone we might infer,
as M. Cuvier well says, all the revolutions of the globe. In effect, this claw
necessarily gives us a toe, and this toe a limb, and this limb a trunk, and this
trunk a cranium, a head, proportionate all with one another; that is to say a
gigantic pangolin, consequently a lost species, consequently revolutions, subver-
sions experienced by the earth, and which have destroyed that species. But I
confine myself here to recalling those great laws on which I have dwelt at more
length elsewhere, and which astonish us less, perhaps, by their extent than by
the amount of evidence which they carry with them.

BY C. M. &LIE DE BEAUMONT,* PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY OF
SCIENCES.

[ Translated for the Smithsonian Institution by C. A. Alexander. ]

Science, like nature, is one; the frontiers of states, the limits of populations,
arrest not its propagation. In all civilized countries men calculate with the
same figures, measure with the same instruments, avail themselves of the same
classifications. Scientific bodies animated by a common spizit collect, by analo-
gous means, the results of the general labor; and all these associations, to give
a higher sanction to their mutual collaboration, have desired that the most
eminent and celebrated of the savants of foreign countries should constitute a
part of their official list.

Among the illustrious persons on whom the Academy has successively con-
ferred the title, so justly coveted, of one of its eight foreign associates, few have
better justified the distinction than he to whom we owe the knowledge that the
mariner’s compass and the lightning conductor present only different effects of
identically the same physical agent.

Jean-Christian Oerstedt was born August 14, 1777, at Rudkjébing, in the
island of Langeland, one of the smallest’of the archipelago of Denmark. His
father exercised the profession of apothecary, and, although the town of Rudk-
jObing then counted less than 1,000 inhabitants, he had full occupation. or
fear that the young Christian should not be properly looked after in the paternal
dwelling, he was sent every day to the house of a wig-maker, whose wife enjoyed
the confidence of his parents. A brother, one year younger, who became im after
life the celebrated jurisconsult André Sandée Oersted, acccompanied him thither
the following year. The wig-maker and his wife formed a warm attachment for
the two brothers. The wife taught them to read; the husband instructed them
in German, which was his mother tongue. ‘The pupils made rapid progress,
owing, perhaps, in reality more to a happy natural aptitude than to any talent
in the teachers, but which sufliced to induce many other families to send their
own children likewise to this improvised school where knowledge was imparted
so quickly and so well. The wig-maker, transformed into schoolmaster, daily
read to his pupils some pages of a German Bible, which was thus perused from
beginning to end, and afterwards, in great part, read over anew. It was the
daily task of the young Christian to translate word by word into Danish what
had been read in German, and this exercise so far profited him that at the age
of seven years he often embarrassed by his citations those who sought to put his
‘sagacity to the test; whence the gossips of the vicinage .used to say of him,
This child will not live; he has too much smartness !

* Read at the annual public sitting of the Academy, December 29, 1862.

tI write the name of Oersted as it has always been written in the publications of the
Academy: In this the German orthography has been followed, while it would perhaps have
been preferable to conform to the Danish orthography, in which the name is written Orsted,
or without the majuscule Orsted. In Denmark it is pronounced Eursted, which is also the
German pronunciation of the word Oersted, whence we are wrong in habitually pronouncing
it as if it were written Ersted.
MEMOIR OF OERSTED. 167

The wig-maker further taught him addition and subtraction; it was all he
himself knew of arithmetic; but witha slight help from others, and a book found
at his father’s, the child was not slow in learning the rest as far as the rule of
three, inclusive ; no equivocal proof of unusual precocity of intellect. An extra-
ordinary memory was early remarked in him, and was retained till death, eqnally
with all the other happy endowments which he had received from nature.

When Christian had reached-the age of 12, he and his brother, who was then
11, entered as apprentices the pharmacy of their father, whereby their secret
wishes were at first contravened, for both had conceived the project of devoting
themselves to the study of theology. The elder of the two, however, soon began
to acquire a taste for pharmaceutical operations, and labored zealously in the
paternal laboratory, reading at the same time all the books of chemistry and
natural history which fell into his hands. Thus early was developed the incli-
nation which led him to the study of nature. A student in theology daily devo-
ted some hours to the instruction of the brothers in Greek and Latin. 'The elder
applied himself moreover to the acquisition of the French, the younger to that of
the English language. From this period the former evinced a decided taste for
poetry, a taste which adhered to him all his life. He translated about this
time several odes of Horace and a part of the Henriade into Danish.

These rather precarious means of instruction still bore happy fruits. In the spring
of the year 1794, the brothers, aged respectively 17 and 16, were qualified to pro-
ceedto Copenhagen, where, after but afew months’ preparation by a skillful master,
who perfected them in the study of the ancient languages, they sustained with
much honor an examination at their exit from the academy. Some two years
afterwards Christian, who had in the meantime earned testimonials of distinction
on all hands, bore off an academic prize for his reply to a question “On the
shades to be observed in the choice of expressions, according as one writes in
prose or in verse.” Finally, during the autumn of 1799, he obtained the degree
of doctor of philosophy upon the presentation of a thesis in metaphysics, (de
Jorma metaphysices elementaris nature externe.)

In the year last named, and those immediately following, he published divers
short dissertations and critical analyses, which were generally inserted in the
periodical collections. He thus evinced in turn the tendency of his mind to
literature, to poetry, and to philosophy. These formed, indeed, only an accessory
occupation; but, apart from his natural predisposition, favorable circumstances
rendered these momentary efforts of singular advantage in the development of his
faculties. His brother, with whom he always lived inthe most cordial intimacy,
had chiefly devoted himself to the study of philosophy, and the habit, which was
maintained during life, of a daily interchange of ideas, led our physicist to a profit-
able participation in the same pursuit. Having become familiar with the
writings of Kant, Fichte, Schelling, he caught sight of a great general law of
unity in the physical world, which continued always to be one of the habitual
subjects of his meditation. Struck at the same time with the beauty of natural
laws, he became sensible of something profoundly poetic in nature, on which his
innate taste for poetry seized with avidity.

His first essays, which had fixed the attention of the citizens of Copenhagen,
placed him on terms of friendly intimacy with most of his young cotemporaries
who were rising into distinction, particularly with Oclenschliger, who, as a poet,
achieved some years afterwards so brilliant and well-merited a reputation. ‘This
attractive intercourse impelled him to the study of belles-lettres. ‘To no import-
aut production of Danish or German literature, or of the elder French literature,
was he a stranger. His admirable memory was garnished with the choicest pas-
sages, which, even at an advanced age, he was wont to cite with singular apposite-
ness. Nor did he fail sometimes to exercise his own poetic powers, and, in the
eyes of persons competent to judge of Danish verse, an Ode to the French, which
he composed about this time, appeared to give indications of genuine talent. A
168 MEMOIR OF OERSTED.

happy concurrence of circumstances brought Oersted also into intercourse with
Stetfens, and the two brothers Mynster, with whom he long continued to main- -
tain philosophical and even theological discussions, which, whatever their vivacity,
were never permitted to interfere with the claims of a reciprocal friendship.

The rectitude of his judgment always prevented these accessory exercises of
thought from impairing the progress of his scientific studies; buat they did not a
little contribute to draw general attention to him; a kindly attention which
greatly facilitated the development of his subsequent career.

Of that career positive science was always the basis, and his success was rapid.
At his examination in pharmacy, May 20, 1797, he astonished his judges by the
extent of his knowledge, and one of them, on goiug away, having met with Pro-
fessor Manthey, proprietor of the pharmacy in which Oersted had labored,
addressed him in these words: “ What a candidate is this you have sent us; he
knows more than all of us together!” The following year Oersted obtained a
new prize from the Academy; this time on a question of medicine. In 1800
Professor Manthey, being about to travel abroad, devolved on him the direction
of his pharmacy, and nominated him to supply his place, during absence, in the
lecture-room of the Academy of Surgery. ‘The same year Oersted was received
as adjunct of the faculty of medicine.

At this epoch he occupied himself very actively with chemistry. Theresearches
of Wintrel on the simple galvanic chain had already led to the conception of an
electro-chemical theory, and Ritter had inferred, from the ordinary chemical and
eleetrical facts, the identity of the forces whieh produce them. ‘The labors of
Berthollet on the laws of affinities had also introduced new ‘general views on
chemical forces. Herein lay the subjects of Oersted’s investigations during the
years 1799 and 1800. Earlier studies had prepared him for these general views,
and efforts to surmount certain lines of demarcation established in science by dis-
tinctions too decisive, had even directly revealed to him some of them. An
analysis of the chemical philosophy of Foureroy, read by Oersted m 1799 to the
Scandinavian society, and printed the following year in its bulletin, is unfortu-
nately the sole trace which remains for the public of these first essays. We find
there the alkalis and earths already ranged in a single series, which, commencing
with the most energetic alkalis, terminates with a body rather acid than alkaline,
silicium preceded by aluminium.

But, in 1800, the discovery of the electric pile by Volta threw all the chemists
into commotion. Throughout Europe there was a desire to witness its effects.
Everywhere were constructed similar piles or columns formed of pairs composed
each of a disk of copper and a disk of zinc, pairs superposed on one another and
separated by a piece of moistened cloth. Soon, every one, inthe modish as in the
learned world, knew by experience the strange shocks and sensations felt in the
wrists, in the elbows, when in each hand is held a metallic wire terminating at
one of the two opposite poles of the pile, and one is thus placed in the conrse of
the electric current to which the pile gives rise. Odcrsted was not among the
last to make experiments with this wonderful instrument. Having applied it
especially to the decomposition of divers saline solutions, he gave expression to
this first law, that the quantities of alkalis and acids set at liberty in a solution,
by the action of the pile, are in proportion to their respective capacities of satu-
ration. Here, then, was a step in the career in which he was destined one day
to immortalize himself.

Oersted was now 23 years of age; the time had come for him to travel, as, in
their youth, the German and Scandinavian savants almost always do. He set
out in 1801, and his absence extended to two anda half years. Everywhere
he found with the learned a reception which surpassed the hopes of his friends.
His natural animation, joined to a candid and unaffected self-reliance, stood him
in better stead than the strongest letters of recommendation. His countenance
seemed to announce a certain timidity, but no sooner did any subject awaken in

.
MEMOIR OF OERSTED. 169

him a special interest, such as a point of science to discuss or error to combat,
than he was seen to put forth a boldness, a force of intellect, an eloquence which
would searcely have been suspected from his modest exterior and reserved
demeanor.

He first traversed a great part of Germany, passed six months at Berlin, and
sojourned for some time at Friburg, Jena, and Munich. A new life then ani-
mated thatcountry. Poets and philosophers of eminence had there given to the
human mind an unexpected impulse. ‘This movement bore especially on the
natural sciences, and that assemblage of somewhat vague ideas which was called
the philosophy of nature was in process of development. Od6crsted, with his
philosophic and poetic views on the unity and the beauty of nature, was sufli-
ciently disposed to lend attention to the new German doctrines, and he himself
avows their influence by saying, in the preface of one of his works, published in
1813: “The philosophy of nature, which has been cultivated within 20 years
in Germany, might also assert its claim to some of the views which we are about
to offer.” Yet he never allowed himself to be turned aside from the severe and
positive study of facts and of experiment.

He enjoyed constant conversations with Klaproth, Hermstadt, Paul Erman,
Trommsdorff, with Kielmeyer, the master and friend of Cuvier, with the celebrated
Werner, at Friburg, and with the profound mineralogist and crystallographer Weiss.
He met also Fichte, Schelling, Franz Baader, Schleiermacher, 'Tieck, and the
two Schlegels. But he associated himself more particularly with the ingenious
physicist Ritter, already celebrated for his experiments in galvanism, in which
he had established, among otherthings, that a constant development of electricity
accompanies the phenomena of life. They executed in common a series of
remarkable experiments, and Oersted conceived from that time a high opinion
of the scientific capacity of his collaborator, which frequently appears in his
writings, and particularly in the following passage of the preface of his Researches
on the Identity of Chemical and Electrical Forces, published in 1813: “ Ritter may,
in this respect, be regarded as a creator.* His grand conceptions, and his
labors encountered with a zeal which obstacles and sacrifices were incapable of
subduing, have shed light on almost all parts of the science.” Oecersted often
expressed the opinion that, with more of sequence in his labors, Ritter would
have discovered the electric pile before Volta. Unfortunately Ritter joined with
a very ingenious mind great eccentricity, which crippled his pursuits and abridged
his days.

After sojourning some time at Munich with Ritter, Oersted published at Ratis-
bon, in 1803, a small work entitled Materials for a Chemistry of the XIXth
Century, in which occur highly interesting views respecting the new horizons
opened to chemistry by the discovery of the Voltaic pile. Before parting with
Ritter, who remained at Munich, Oersted had rendered him services which could
only have been inspired by a warm and sympathizing friendship. He proceeded
afterwards to Paris and passed there 15 months in habitual intercourse with
Cuvier, Hatiy, Vanquelin, Charles, Berthollet, Biot, Guiton-Morveau, Thenard ;
assiduously following the courses of, the distinguished professors and sometimes
making communications, on his own experiments, to the Philomathic Society.

During his stay at Paris he translated into French a German memoir of Ritter
on the pile a charger, or secondary pile, (Ladung’s Sdule). This translation,
accompanied by notes on the experiments made by himself, was presented to
the first class of the Institute and printed in the Jowrnal de Physique, number
for Brumaire, an XII, (1803.) Ritter, who had co-operated in the translation by
an uninterrupted correspondence with Oersted, was ‘fully satisfied with it, and
even avowed that he comprehended himself in the French version better than in
his own original German text. He died soon afterwards, and Oersted, independ-

ently of his own original ideas, remained the representative and, in some sort, the
heir of those of Ritter, of whom he had been the last collaborator and interpreter.

Some prepossessions, whatever their origin, perhaps the fear of being received
with a certain superciliousness, had led Oersted to pass almost the w vhole time
of his sojourn in Paris without going to present to the celebrated Fourcroy, pro-
fessor of chemistry at the Poly ieolmie School, a letter of professor Manthey, of
Copenhagen. He decided at last to do so at the instance of the chargé affaires
of Denmark. The elegance, the clearness, the authority with which Fourcroy
discharged the functions sof professor, gave him great ascendency over his pupils ; ;
but, out of the chair, he did not always sufficiently divest himself of the magis-
terial dignity. He congratulated the young and modest Oersted on having come
to Paris and having acquired a knowledge of so many remarkable men, superior
beyond doubt to all the chemists of the north. “T must acknowledge,” replied
Oersted, “that you possess at Paris more dexterity than exists elsewhere in
Chemical manipulations ; ; but there is scarcely to be “found in the north a single
chemist who cannot read i in the original the Systéme des connaissances chimiques
of M. de Fourcroy, which few French chemists could do for works written in the
Scandinavian languages. ” To the question, if he had seen the Polytechnic
School, Oersted replied of course afhirmatively, and Foureroy having made him
duly se msible that this school gave to Paris a great superiority over Denmark,
Oersted rejoined, with perhaps. too ingenuous a confidence: “TI admit that my
country wants much which is needed for the fruitful development of chemistry,
but I do not despair of contributing hereafter to establish there something not
unlike the Polytechnic School.” Upon which, Fourcroy begged him, somewhat
ironically, to be sure to preserve, when he returned home, a kind recollection of
the F rench chemists. This Oersted did not fail to do, and I shall show further
on how he proved it.

In returning to Denmark, Oersted traversed Holland, and, at Harlem, made
a great number of electrical experiments with the learned physicist Van Marum.
At Bremen he contracted a friendship with the astronomer Olbers, and with
Treviranus, celebrated for his labors m physiology and comparative anatomy,
and finally re-entered his country in the month of January, 1804, On hisreturn,
the duty, at first temporary and limited to three years, of delivering lectures on
physics at the University of Copenhagen was confided to him ; In 1806 he was
named professor extraordinary of physics in the same university. He had here
the first opportunity of combining his scientific views in a sy stematic shape, the
outline of which he preserved during his entire life, only modifying certain parts
according to the progress of science. :

His lectures commanded a large attendance; they bore a form which was
peculiar to himself. The skilifal: professor usually commenced in a subdued
tone, with particular considerations and explanations; frequently, indeed, with
the definition of certain expressions, turning on the translation of technical words
into the Danish language. Assured thenceforth of being fully understood, he
followed the logical course of ideas, and warming by degrees, collected the facts
into groups, and these groups into a whole still more comprehensive. ‘The ani-
mation of the lecture, in giving more freedom to his delivery, called forth his
favorite thoughts on the unity, ‘the beauty of nature, and fioures and images pre-
sented themselves which keenly interested his auditors , expecially the younger
portion of them, for those who had already followed other lectures were more sur-
prised at still finding something unusual in his.

It was sometimes objected to Oersted that he saw or imagined in nature com-
binations much more rational than those which can be expected to occur in an
assemblage of material objects ; but he replied that nothing is too rational to be
attributed to the supreme reason which has created every thing. On such a theme
it would be easy to argue a long time without coming to an understanding. It
would be to plunge into the depths of those German discussions in which so

* e

many a subtle genius has exhausted itself without exhausting the subject. But
the obscurity of these depths is sometimes quite d@ la mode on the shores, always

a little foggy, of the Baltic sea.

It seems certain, however, that the lectures of Oersted were well received by
the youth and the public of Copenhagen, for they were always much frequented,
and they secured for the professor an eminent position among his fellow-citizens.
He was not long in establishing agreeable relations with persons of the highest
position in the capital of Denmark, and even with the princes of the royal family.

But a part of his success might also be attributed to his lively and intellectual
conversation, to the frequent articles which he put forth on various subjects, and
to the works which he published at this epoch, such as his Considerations on the
history of chemistry, his Experiments respecting the figures produced by nodal
lines on vibrating surfaces, a subject to which Chladni had already devoted an
important work ; and a Discourse on the pleasure produced by sound, a discourse
in which he developed, under a point of view peculiar to himself, the laws of
the beautiful.

He thus continued to publish, as he had done from his youth, a multitude of
memoirs and articles of more or less extent on different subjects relating to the
natural sciences and to philosophy, all of which met with appreciative readers.
Nevertheless, Copenhagen was not a center to which everything converged as
is Paris or London. In a city of secondary importance one may keep himself
informed of what is written, but the inconvenience is soon felt of not knowing
what is talked about in the learned world. Oersted, who had need of direct
communication with entire Europe, felt himself impelled to undertake new expe-
ditions. He set out for Berlin May 7, 1812, where he passed three months and
gave to the press, in the German language, one of his most important works,
entitled “‘ Views of the chemical laws of nature,” (Ansichten der chemischen
Naturgesetze.) In passing through Germany he visited Oken, Schweiger, and
Hegel, and established friendly relations with the ingenious physicist Seebeck,
who, some years afterwards, made the discovery of thermo-electricity. He then
revisited Paris, where he made quite a long stay, and, about the middle of the
year 1813, returned to Copenhagen, there to receive anew from his countrymen
tokens of the cordial consideration which he had long before inspired.

In 1814 Oersted published, in the programme of ‘the university, an essay on
a chemical nomenelature common to all the Germano-Scandinavian languages.
The names proposed were so happily appropriate to the genius of those tonones
that they were generally adopted, and are still in use in all the countries of we
north. In 1815 the Royal Society of Sciences of Copenhagen, having lost its
excellent secretary, Bugge, Oersted was chosen to replace him, and, the same
year, the King named him a chevalier of the order of Danebrog. - Two years
afterwards the university conferred on him the title of professor in ordinary,

(professor ordinarius,) a title superior to that of professor extraordinary waieh
he had borne for more than 10 years.

About this time Oersted undertook a remarkable series of experiments on the
compressibility of water, and found almost exactly, though by new means of his
own invention, the numbers which the celebrated English phy sicist Cantor had
obtained half a century before.

In 1818 and 1819 he undertook, with MM. Esmarch and Forschhanmer,
explorations in the island of Bornholm, for the purpose of examining its geo.ogical
constitution with reference to the working of the coal and iron ore which are
found there, and he made these investigations the subject of several publica-
tions. ‘This was the commencement of a geological study of Denmark, estab-
lished on new scientific bases. Oersted, however 7, was unable to prosecute this
operation, which, continued by M. Forschhammer, has given to Denmark the
excellent geological chart well known to this Academy.

The journeys to Bornholm did not interrupt the habitual course of Oersted’s
72 MEMOIR OF OERSTED.

publications on science and philosophy. Among his memoirs on physics should
be particularly cited one on the trongh-battery, executed in conjunction with his
friend, Professor Esmarch. Another work, entitled Principles of the New Chem-
istry, which appeared at Copenhagen in 1820, had been composed for the auditors
of his course, with a view to placing within their reach the doctrines taught in
his numerous writings on chemistry and electricity, and particularly in his Views
of the chemical laws of nature. First printed at Berlin, as I have said, this
exposition of his favorite ideas had been translated into French by M. Marcel
de Serres, and published at Paris, in 1813, with the concurrence of its author
and that of our distinguished colleague, M. Chevreul, under the title of Researches
on the identity of chemical and electric forces, a title which clearly defined its
object.

This learned and ingenious work, dedicated to the author of the Statique
Chimique, our illustrious Berthollet, was in truth the principal fruit of the labors
and meditations of Oersted from his earliest youth. A citation of some passages
of this admirable book will suffice to give an idea of the profound and original
views which had presided over its composition: “* * * * The chemical
part of the natural sciences,” says Oersted, “is far from having attained the
perfection which their mechanical part has reached, and cannot, like the latter‘
deduce from a small number of principles, already connected with one another,
all the other principles; but it has been obliged to seek each particular propo-
sition, each particular law, by means of experiments undertaken solely with that
particular view. Now the greater part of these laws have hitherto so little
enabled us to see the bonds which unite them, that it was necessary to be con-
vinced, by general considerations, of the unity which exists in all the works of
nature, in order not to be deceived as regards that unity.

“The actual state, in 1813, of the chemical part of the natural sciences might
be compared to that of their mechanical part before Galileo, Descartes, Huyghens,
and Newton had taught us to reduce the more compound movements to their
most simple principles. Before these illustrious physicists, it is true, agreat num-
ber of important facts were known, even some remarkable series of facts, but
that great principle of unity to which science owes its present high degree of
perfection had not yet been arrived at. * * * *”

Oersted saw this great principle of unity in the uniformity of the general laws
of mechanics, and he found an example of the duality, which also he every-
where sought, in the two forces which concur in producing circular or curvilinear
motion. ‘To find examples of the confusion which had preceded the discovery
of these forces, it is sufficient, he said, “‘to read what was written on the classifi-
cation of motions by the celebrated Bacon, who, although a cotemporary of
Galileo, still speaks of a violent and natural motion, and of so many other kinds
of motions, which he knew no better how to reduce to a single principle than do
the chemists at the present time know how to reduce the affinities of the alkalies,
acids, earths, oxides, combustible bodies, and oxygen to one identical primitive
BCUONs 5), Miitinue te

“By referring all motions to their fundamental laws, the mechanical part of
the natural sciences,” adds Oersted, “ has been raised to that present degree of per-
fection which embraces all the movements of the universe as one great mechanical
problem, whose solution enables us to calculate in advance an infinitude of par-
ticular phenomena. In order to prepare the chemical part of the natural sciences
for a like perfection, we must endeavor to reduce all chemical actions to the
primitive forces which produce them; we shall then also be in a position to
calculate all the chemical properties of the primitive forces and their laws. Thus,
chemistry being only occupied with these properties, this whole science will be
converted into a theory of forces, to which mathematics may be applied, and it
will thereby acquire perhaps new capacities, like those which have been derived
from the application of mathematics to movement.

“The discoveries which have been made since the commencement of this
century may so far contribute to advance chemistry towards this state of perfec-
tion that I have thought it would be useful” (it is still Oersted who speaks) “to
collect here the scattered materials, in order to attempt the formation of a system.
A first attempt of this kind can, doubtless, be but imperfect ; but it must at last
be necessary to take this first step, and I have judged it proper not to defer

taking it, * * * * forthe investigator of nature will make no great das-
covery except in so far as he shall have a certain idea which leads him to pro-
pound, so to say, his questions to nature, as well as a determinate scope for his
observations. "The object, therefore, of the system which we here present is
chiefly to draw attention to certain important problems, and to serve as prelimi-
nary to other more perfect systems which the rapid progress of science will not
fail soon to call forth. It is only by the united efforts of a great number of
savants, and after some generations, that chemical science can attain that degree
ef perfection which, with perhaps too much boldness, we have ventured to antici- —
pate.

“Tt will not be useless, at our first step in this undertaking, to cast a glance
over the space which we shall have to traverse. We shall commence our
researches by a general classification of all the inorganic bodies according to
their chemical nature. We shall then present some considerations on the chem-
ical actions best known, in order to prove that all the chemical phenomena which
have been studied up to this time may be attributed to two forces diffused through
all nature. We shall show that these forces act not only in the immediate con-
tact between two bodies, but that they can also be transmitted, by some medium,
from one to the other. ‘This will lead us to discover, independently of electrical
considerations, the chemical action which we have recognized in galvanism. By
means of these successive approaches we shall be able finally to present the
chemical forces in the state in which they are most free, and to render evident,
at the same time, the identity of those forces with electrical forces.”*

I should have abridged this long passage still more than I have done, had I
not desired that it should be comprehended to what extent, according to Oersted,
is to be found in the general uniformity of the laws of chemical composition that
great principle of unity which, agreeably to his philosophical conceptions, exists
in all nature, and, at the same time, the duality which he also sought there in
the two electricities, positive and negative. ‘“ Finally,” Oersted continues, “ we
shall endeavor, in order still better to prove the universality of the two chemical
or electrical forces, to show that they also produce the magnetic phenomena and
the principal changes in organic nature.”t These lines already contained, so to
say, the programme of the. great discovery which he was on the point of making,

‘In this work, as in his varlier essays of 1799, Oersted placed aluminium in the
rear of the alkaline earths, ¢ as less alkaline than all these latter, and indeed
almost an acid. After aluminium came silicium, more acid than alkaline ; while
glass, he said, might be considered as a salt.§ It will be admitted that from
thence to the ‘theory of the silicates there was but a step; this new advance was
achieved some time afterwards by Smithson Tennant; but, as every one knows,
it was Berzelius, beyond all others, who developed the theory of the silicates.

The work of Oersted, which the limits prescribed to this notice do not permit
me completely to analyze, contains a multiplicity of views; all equally marked
by justness of thought, and more than one of which offers even at this day some-
thing of the piquancy of novelty.

In another passage, seeking to find among authors already become antique—
such as Winterl, Ritter, &c. —the first rudiments of the ideas which oceupied
him, and which it was the object of his book to develop, Oersted added: “The

174 MEMOIR OF OERSTED.

advantage which we may attain over these predecessors of ours will be, for the
greatest “part, due to the “profound researches of the celebrated Berthollet, and to
the grand discoveries of Davy and Berzelius, three illustrious savants on the
possession of whom our era can never cease to pride itself.”

There was the more merit on the part of Oersted in thus ranking Berzelius
among the great lights of chemistry, inasmuch as Berzelius, rather younger than
himself, was his rival in the branch ‘of the science to which he attached the most
interest ; and it should never be forgotten that if the honor of having completely
unfolded the electro- chemical system reverts to Berzelius, Oersted had arrived
before him at a closely analogous result, although one less developed. Tor the
rest, what at the present day is of most import to the memor y of Oersted in rela-
tion to this work, is perhaps the palpable proof found therein of his ceaseless
preoccupation with the subject of electrical phenomena. He had conferred
great improvements on the pile; he was one among the most practiced experi-
menters in employing it; he had formally indicated magnetism as one of the
phenomena of which it w vould some day furnish the explanation, and no one was
better prepared than himself to advance to the practical realization of this new
conquest.

Yet all the attempts thus far made had remained unfruitful. The expedient
had been tried of placing the two poles of a battery as highly charged as possi-
ble in a parallel line with the poles of a strongly magnetized needle ; no effect,
however, had been produced. Nevertheless, the conviction. still ’ prevailed,
especially with Oersted, that a relation must exist between galvanism and elec-
tricity. The route to the discovery was unknown, though hazard might open it
unexpectedly.

Fortune, it might be ; cae ceased to be blind at the moment when to Oersted
was allotted the privilege of first divining that it was not electricity in repose
accumulated at the two poles of a char eed battery, but electricity in movement
along the conductor by which one of the poles is discharged into the other,
which would exert an action on the magnetized needle. “While thinking of
this—it was during the animation of a lecture before the assembled pupils—
Oersted announces to them what he is about to tr y; he takes a magnetic needle,
- places it near the electric battery, waits till the needle has arrived at a state of
rest; then seizing the conjunctive wire traversed by the current of the battery,
he places it above the magnetic needle, carefully avoiding: any manner of col-
lision. ‘The needle—every one plainly sees it—the needle is at once in motion.
The question is resolved! Oecrsted has crowned, by a great discovery, the
labors of his whole previous life.

{t was on the 21st July, 1820, that Oersted communicated to learned Europe
the important fact with ey his genius had just enriched science. He con-
signed it to a small tract written in Li atin, of only four pages in 4to, which, not-
withstanding its conciseness, presented with perfect clearness, the results of.
more than fifty experiments, and left scarcely anything to be added on the
subject. [his composition, entitled Experimenta circa effectum, ete.—(Hixperi-
ments on the effect of the electrical conflict upon the magnetic needle)—was
addressed the same day by post to all the societies in Europe which occupy
themselves with the natural sciences. A French translation of it appeared in
the number of the Annales de chimie et de physique for August, 1820, from which
I transcribe a few expressions employed by Oersted on this occasion:

“The first experiments on the subject I undertake to explain were made in
the lectures which I gave last winter on electricity and magnetism. They
evinced in general, that the magnetic needle changed its direction through the
influence of the voltaic apparatus, and that this effect took place when the cir-
cuit was formed, and not when it was interrupted; a process which had been
attempted in vain by celebrated physicists, some years before. But, as my

*
MEMOIR OF OERSTED. 175

experiments had been made with an apparatus of small energy, the effect of
which was not so striking as was called for by the ‘Importance of the fact to be
established, I invited my friend Esmarch, judicial councillor to his Majesty; to
unite with me in repeating them with a more powerful apparatus. We had
also for associates and witnesses the Chevalier de Vlengel, MM. Hauch and
Reinart, professors of natural history ; Jacobson, a very skillful physician and
chemist, and Zeise, professor of philosophy. I made other experiments when
alone, and if these taught me anything new, I took the precaution of repeating
them in the presence of these eminent men of science. * * * In order to make
the experiment, we put in communication the opposite poles of the voltaic appa-
ratus by a metallic wire, which we will call, for brevity, the conducting or con-
junctive wire ; and we will designate the effect which is manifested in this con-
ductor and around it during the voltaic action by the term electric conflict.

“ Let us suppose now that the rectilinear part of this wire is horizontal, and
placed above and parallel to a magnetic needle freely suspended * * * the
latter will move in such a manner that, under the part of the conjunctive wire
which is nearest to the negative pole of the apparatus, it will deviate towards
the west. * * * Ifthe conjunctive wire is arranged horizontally ender the
needle, the effects are of the same nature with those w vhich take place when the
wire is above the needle; but they act in an inverse dire at is to say, the
pole of the needle, under which is the part of the conjunctive wire that receives
the negative electricity of the apparatus, irclines towards the east. * * *
It appears, from the facts stated, that the electric conflict is not inclosed in
the conducting wire, but that it has around it quite an extensive sphere of activ-
ity. We may conclude from the observations that this conflict acts by a vorti-
cal or whirling movement.”

Such was the theory of Oersted: we shall presently see that he was less
happy in his theory than in his experiment.

In publishing the memoir of Oersted in the Annales de chimie et de physique,
M. Arago added a note in which he said that the results there recorded, “ how-
ever singular they might appear, are acconipanied by too many details ‘to leave
room for any suspicion of error.” He cited, moreover, the experiments of veri-
fication made in his presence, at Geneva, by M. de la Rive.

. The explanation proposed by Oersted for the capital fact which he had just
discovered, recalled in some respects the vortices of Descartes. This did not
much savor of the spirit of the present epoch; it met consequently with but
little acceptance. At the end of barely a few weeks, Ampére had replaced it
by another, based on a law of attraction. I borrow the recital of this scientific
event from the spirited and learned loge of Ampere, read by M. Avago to this
Academy, 21st August, 1839:

“The ‘discovery of Oersted reached Paris by Switzerland. In our weekly
session of Monday, 11th September, 1820, an academician who had come ee
Geneva” (it was M. Avago himself) “ repeated before the Academy the expe:
ments of the learned Dane. Seven days after, Ampére laid before us a Pact
much more general than that of the physicist of Copenhagen. In‘so short an
interval of time he had divined that two conjunctive wires, that two wires
traversed by electric currents, would act one on the other; he had devised
extremely ingenious arrangements for rendering these wires movable, without
the necessity. of detaching the extremity of each of them from the respective
poles of their batteries ; “he had realized, transformed these conceptions into
instruments susceptible of operating ; he had finally submitted his capital idea
to a decisive experiment. I know not if the vast field of physics ever presented
so admirable a discovery, conceived, made and completed with equal rapidkty.

“OF this brilliant discovery of Ampere the following statement may suffice :
two parallel conjunctive wires attract each other when electricity traverses them
in the same direction; they repel one another, if the electric currents move in

176 MEMOIR OF OERSTED.

opposite directions.” The sequel of Ampére’s labors showed “ that the recipro-
cal action of the elements of two currents is exerted in conformity with the line
which unites their centers; that it depends on the mutual inclination of those
elements, and that it varies in intensity in the inverse ratio of the square of the
distances.” Ampere finally succeeded in establishing that a conjunctive wire
wound into a helix with very close spires, is sensitive to the magnetic action of
the earth. For many weeks there was to be seen in his cabinet “a conjunctive
wire of platina whose position was determined by the action of the terresirial
globe.” Ampere, by constructing a galvanic compass, had shown that the forces
which act in the magnetic needle are electric currents, and by his learned calcu-
lations on the reciprocal action of those currents he accounted for all the actions
which the conjunctive wire of the pile exerts, in the experiments of Oersted, on
the magnetic needle.

Electro-magnetism had thus become the common glory of Oersted and Ampére,
and renown, by uniting the names of these two illustrious savants, not unnat-
urally calls attention to the resemblances or the contrasts which existed between
them.

They were throughout nearly cotemporary, Ampére having been born the 22d
January, 1775, and Oersted the 14th August, 1777. Both had entered upon life
in a very modest condition as regards fortune; both had had slender means of
instruction, and had at first informed themselves with little help from masters
and even little from books. Ocrsted had composed poetry not destiiute of
merit; Ampere, in his youth, wrote French verses replete with delicacy and
grace, some of which have appeared to M. Arago no unworthy ornaments for
his eulogy. Oersted always saw in the harmonies of nature a poetry superior
to all other poetry ; Ampere, in the evening of his life, composed in Latin
verse a general tablet of the classification of the sciences, in which elegance
disputes the palm with precision. -

Oersted, a declared disciple of Kant, applied his ideas to the material world
as a consummate physicist; Ampére, an enthusiastic sympathizer with Maine de
Biran, Royer Collard, and Cousin, exercised his acute and powerful faculties
and manifested a lively interest in disentangling the most subtle problems of
metaphysics. Both were skilled in communicating to their learned instructions
a peculiar attraction, though each in a different kind. Each of them has left,
among friends, colleagues, pupils, remembrances full of that affectionate admi-
ration which can never be effaced.

Oersted made his first scientific essays in the pharmacy of his father; before
all else he was a chemist. Ampére, at the age of thirteen, borrowed from the
public library of Lyons the mathematical works of Bernouilli; he was born a
geometer, but the Encyclopedia having been his first book, he had, from his
infancy, embraced all the branches of human knowledge and had even become
profound in many of them. M. Arago has felt authorized to say of him, in
speakine of his labors in chemical classification, “that, during one of the last
revolutions of science, Ampere, the geometer Ampere, proved always in the
right, even when his opinions were opposed to those of almost all the chemists
of the world.”

Without Oersted, electro-magnetism might not have existed ; without Ampére,
it might have been confined to an exceedingly curious, but limited experiment.
‘The co-operation of Oersted and Ampére made it, in a very little time, a com-
plete science, a science destined to change the face of the world by the sur-
prising applications of it which have been already realized, and in which it is
employed entire without distinction as to the origin of its different parts.

I have often heard it asked who was the true inventor of the electric tele-
graph. Reference has been made to ingenious physicists, who in the course of
the last century transmitted to a distance, by means of the electric spark,
instantaneous signals. As well might the learned, when the brothers Chappe

s
De ail

had, in 1792, invented the aerial telegraph, recall the fact that the Gauls had
transmitted distant signals by means of wooden beams set in motion. Neither
the Gauls nor the older physicists had created any regular means of correspond-
ence.

Among those whom I haye the honor of addressing, several may be able, like
myself, to recall the memorable lectures which M. Ampére delivered at the Col-
lege of France at the commencement of 1832, in which he had the boldness to
express his ideas on the relations of the structure of different classes of animals
in contradiction to Cuvier, who lectured in the adjacent amphitheater; ingenious
ideas which M. Cuvier overwhelmed at each lecture with peremptory facts,
and which M. Ampére, accommodating himself to those facts, reproduced still
more ingeniously in his subsequent lecture. In this course, naturally much
frequented, and which was in substance a course of experimental physics, M.
Ampere spoke one day of electrical currents, and, after having represented on
the table four small magnetic needles with metallic wires suitably encompass-
ing them, he explained how an electric current transmitted at will in such
or such a manner, by means of these wires, would cause a declination of such or
such of these needles in definite directions, so as to produce divers combinations,
to each of which might be attributed the value of one of the letters of the
alphabet ; how, in fine, by varying at will and with the rapidity of writing the
mode of propagation of the electric current, words, phrases, discourses might be
formed by the succession of these conventional letters.

M. Ampere particularly cherished this idea and often recurred to it in con-
versing with his friends; but his fertile imagination did not stop with a single
process, and sometimes, instead of needles, he proposed the employment of vases
filled with water in which should be produced alternately disengagements of
oxygen and hydrogen by the decomposition of the liquid. On the whole, it is
impossible to deny that from that time the fundamental idea of a future electric
telegraph existed among the auditors and friends of M. Ampére. ‘There
remained nothing more than to execute it practically. Such execution was
rendered much more easy by the result of the experiments of M. Arago on the
momentary magnetization of soft iron by the electric current, and by the
knowledve of the laws of the remarkable phenomenon of induction, established
by M. Faraday. — ;

Every one knows how, from station to station, long metallic threads, placed
on insulating supports, have been stretched in order to transmit the electric cur-
rent from point to point. In the first arrangements of apparatus for this pur-
pose, in that especially which M. Wheatstone established between Paris and
Versailles and which was in operation in 1845, the electric current was produced
by magnets, for which was afterwards substituted an electric battery, as being
susceptible of more energetic action. ‘The conducting wires were reduced, for
each apparatus, to a single one, the mass of the earth sufficing for the return of
the current. The needles were also reduced to a single one, which stopped in
any desired position before a dial-plate bearing on its circumference the 25 let-
ters of the alphabet, the 10 numerals, points, &e. To bring the needle to a
certain radius of the dial and to a definite letter, the dentated wheel on which
it depended was made to traverse a suitable number of notches, by as often
interrupting and re-establishing the electric.current. This idea of suspending
and restoring the current by interruptions variously diversified, was the most
essential addition which had been made to the fundamental idea of Ampere.
The interruptions and re-establishments of the current occasion, so to speak, a
succession of electric waves, comparable, in a certain measuye, to the sonorous
waves by means of which our voice is propagated, but infinitely more rapid.

Since these first essays, the mechanism employed has been singularly varied.
The dials and needles have been suppressed and replaced by other combinations.
A ae of ingenious instruments, cut-offs, pole-changers, manipulators,

electro-magnets, magnets variously armed, have been devised by a throng of men
of talent. This pursuit, still so new, is one of those in which the inventive
spirit of our age has most favorably displayed itself; but, whatever the process,
it always substantially consists in operating, at a distance and even beyond the
seas, with the electro-magnetic currents of Oersted and Ampere.

[This statement can scarcely be considered as correct, even in view of the
rhetorical license of the ealogist. The currents used in telegraphing are, strictly
speaking, neither the discoveries of Oersted nor of Ampére, but of Volta and of
Faraday. There are three different forms of the telegraph : first, that of pure
electricity which transmits messages by a galvanic current, and makes signals
by sparks or by marks on chemical paper. Second, that of the needle moved
by a galvanic current, first suggested by Ampere. Third, that of an _electro-
magnet which produces sounds, and also marks on paper at a distance. The first
of these depends essentially on the discovery of Volta, and the other two on the
primary fact of Oersted, extended, applied, and modified by others—J. H.]

In a very interesting account of Oersted, from which I have borrowed many
of the details here cited, professor Hauch, of Copenhagen, compares, with no
unjustifiable enthusiasm, his master Oersted discovering, after long meditation,
the action of the pile on the magnetic needle and thus opening for science hor-
izons altogether new, to Christopher Columbus discovering America, after having
dreamed all his life of the existence of a great continent beyond the ocean.*
He might have added that Oersted, more fortunate than Columbus, encountered
no Americus Vespucius to dispute with him the glory of his discovery. _ Ampere,
the most modest of men, had need of no glory but his own, if, indeed, he ever
occupied himself with that; and moreover, in electro-magnetic science, the parts
of Oersted and of Ampére have remained perfectly distinct. If the fundamental
experiment is the incontestable property of Oersted, the developments immedi-
ately added by Ampere were the frnit of a spirit of invention which yields not
in merit tothe most original experiment, and of an analytical science which
could only be met with in a geometer like Ampere, and, it may be added, in
those colleagues of ours who bore a part in his calculations, M. Savary, M.
Liouville, and our actual president M. Duhamel.

It pertained to the members of this Academy, the colleagues of Ampére, to be
first in proclaiming all the merit of Oersted. The occasion was embraced with
the ardor which, in such circumstances, is always native to it. We read accord-
ingly, in the statement regarding the prizes awarded, 8th April, 1822, as follows :

* The first idea of this comparison reverts to Sir John Herschel, as may be seen by the
following letter of M. de Humboldt to Oersted, a translation of which has been obligingly
communicated to me by M. de la Roquette, former consul of France in Denmark :

‘« Assuredly, M. Councillor, it wiil be a pleasure to the King to see you again and to
express to you how much his Majesty is personally flattered at receiving among us a man of
your celebrity.’ You are invited for to-morrow noon to the King’s table, and in the evening
at the new palace to the first representation of Medea in the Court Theater. * * * * *
I have just read to-night in Herschel’s Study of Natural Philosophy, p. 340, this fine passage
concerning you: ‘‘In Oersted there is something which reminds us of the obstinate adherence
of Columbus to his notions of the necessary existence of the new world, and the sole history of
Oersted’s beautiful discovery may serve to teachus * * * * .” This is a just eulogy
expressed in very ingenious terms. With the highest consideration, your obedient,

‘‘A, DE HUMBOLDT.”

A second letter of M. Humboldt to Oersted, also communicated to me by M. de la
Roquette, will further contribute to show with what regard and cordiality Oersted was
received at Berlin:

‘*May I count, dear doctor, on the pleasure of seeing you again before your departure ?
I desire not only to rgad once more your instructive memoir on the repose of the voléanoes
of Nicaragua, but also to have some doubts respecting Squier resolved. The King being
to arrive to-day, I shall be occupied until Friday. On that day or the following, may I
flatter myself with the hope of seeing you at Berlin? * * * *.* With distinguished
consideration, &c. A. DE HUMBOLDT.”
MEMOIR OF OERSTED. 179

“ The Academy announced in its public session of the 27th March, 1820, that in
that of March, 1822 it would award the prize of mathematics, consisting of a gold
medal of the value of 3,000 franes, to the best work or memoir on pure or
applied mathematics, which shall have appeared or been communicated to the
Academy during the space of two years which are accorded to competitors.

‘Many physico-mathematical researches, worthy of high praise, have appeared
in that interval. * * * But the importance of.the discovery of the action
of the voltaic pile on the magnetic needle, a discovery which furnishes a new
principle to applied mathematics,-and which has already given rise to interesting
applications of analysis, has determined the commission to award to it the prize
of mathematics. ‘The commission charged with the examination of articles for
the prizes of mathematics is in the habit of adjudging those prizes without the
co-operation of the Academy. But as the discovery in question is not explicitly
eomprised in the programme, it has been thought that the authorization of the
society should be invoked for awarding the prize to this admirable discovery.
This proposal having been submitted to the deliberations of the Academy, was

unhesitatingly adopted.”

A place having soon afterwards become vacant among the correspondents of
the Academy for the section of physics, the nomination of M. Oersted to supply
it took place 9th June, 1823. In the sequel, the highest scientific distinction at
the disposal of the Academy was conferred on him, 11th April, 1842, by his elee-
tion as one of its eight foreign associates, to replace the distinguished botanist
de Candolle.

The just eclat which had attended the discovery of Oersted, by no means
diminished his desire of sometimes placing himself in personal communication
with the savants of other countries. In 1822 he again went to Germany,
where, independently of those who more peculiarly ranked as savants, Goethe,
the illustrious poet, to whom nothing in the domain of intellect was alien,
received him with distinction ; as is testified by the manner in which Oersted’s
discovery is spoken of in several passages of his writings.

Oersted was now, for some time, engaged in thermo-electric experiments with
Seebeck, and afterwards came to Paris in 1823. The Academy shared the
pleasure which he experienced on taking his place in its ranks, and, during his
sojourn, was entertained by several series of experiments which he performed
in its presence, not the least curious of which were those executed in common
by himself and Fourier.* In these, bars of bismuth and of antimony soldered
together alternately and forming a closed circuit, were employed. By heating
or cooling the solderings, electrical currents were produced which appeared more
abundant but less intense than the currents developed by weak hydro-electric
action, and gave occasion to many interesting observations. x

‘Towards the middle of summer Oersted passed into England and Scotland,
and was received, as he had been in France, with a cordiality and attention
which testified the high estimation in which the author of the discovery of
electro-magnetism was equally held in those countries. On his return to Copen-
hagen, he resumed his life of labor with more ardor than ever. The north of
Enrope then exhibited the spectacle of a brilliant scientific arena. At Stock-
holm, Berzetins, one of the princes of chemistry, at Copenhagen, Oersted, one
of the princes of physics, formed, as it were, two centers of labor and discovery,
around which gravitated, like so many brilliant satellites, men destined them-
selves to a just and well-earned celebrity—Arfvedson, Nordenskiold, Bonsdorff,
Mitscherlich, Gustave and Henry Rose, &c.

The noble emulation which established itself between the laboratories of the
two capitals is easily conceived. Oecersted reapplied himself to chemistry.
Resuming at the end of a quarter of a century his investigations of 1799 on
alumina, he accomplished, in 1824, a work which placed him in the rank of the

* See Annales de chim. et de physique, t. xxxii, p. 575, (April, 1823.)

180 MEMOIR .OF OERSTED.

most eminent practical chemists, and obtained, after prolonged efforts, the chlo-
ride of aluminum. No one before him had effected the decomposition of alu-
mina. Yet he did not succeed in insulating the aluminum; this last and import-
ant step was reserved for M. Vohler, the distinguished chemist of Gottingen.
Still later, our young and learned colleague, M. Henri Sainte-Claire Deville,
has formed of aluminum a new and valuable element of metallurgic industry.

One of the last labors of Oersted relates to the celebrated diamagnetic dis-
coyeries of our illustrious colleague M. Faraday, whose experiments had already
added so many curious facts to electro-magnetism, as well as to the researches
made on the same subject by some German savants, especially by M. Reich, of
Friburg.

Oersted presented his first results to the Royal Society of Sciences of Copen-
hagen, 30th June, 1848, and gave a review of them in the Compte Rendu of the
transactions of the society. He soon afterwards drew up a more complete
memoir, which has been published in French.* ‘Therein he recognizes a decreas-
ing magnetic progression which includes the magnetic bodies properly so-called,
the attractable diamagnetic bodies, the repellable diamagnetic bodies. The
magnetism of these last may, according to him, be considered as negative, if we
regard the magnetism of iron and of the attractable diamagnetic bodies as posi-
tive. Oersted showed herein that, experiment in hand, he always kept himself
abreast of the progress of physics, and particularly of electro-magnetism.

In effect, the weight of years never relaxed the activity of Oersted. Were I
to undertake a bare enumeration of the researches and writings of every kind
which he executed at Copenhagen during the last twenty-five years of his life,
I should much exceed the time at my disposal. But, while omitting this long
catalogue, in which are numbered nevertheless important memoirs on electricity
and magnetism, on the compressibility of liquids and of gases, on the heat
developed by the compression of water, on capillary phenomena, works of liter-
ature and philosophy, &c.,t I feel bound to point out what contributed in quite

+ The following note, for which I am indebted to M. de la Roquette, makes us acquainted
with one of these last works:

“Oersted published, about 1850, two volumes under the title of Aandeni Naturen, a
philosophic work which appears to me of high import; it forms a series of treatises in which
the author introduces us, ina manner at once philosophic and popular, to the study of
nature, by revealing to us the eternal spirit which determines all its phenomena, and the
relation under which this spirit exists towards the material and intellectual world. The
following is the substance of the tracts or chapters of which the work is composed :

“Vol. I. (1) Of spirit manifested in matter, The author develops what is constant or
immutable in the continual changes of bodies; it is the single thought or design which
exists therein. The unity of this thought pertains to nature, for the natural laws, which are
constant and invariable, are laws of reason; not of the reason which is in us, but of that
which prevails in the entire universe. It is the assemblage of laws determining the activity
of an object, which constitutes its real essence. These laws, which may be properly called
the ideas of nature, form in every object a unity which may be qualified as the essential
meaning of the object or its idea. This idea does not exist solely in the thought; it is real-
ized, on the contrary, in the acting forces of the objects. The being of the object is thus an
animated or living idea. In order to place these interesting reflections within the reach of
all, the author has recourse to the form of dialogue, like Plato, Fontenella and Fenelon ; his
style is at once simple and clear, rich and varied. (2) The fountain and the jet d’eau.
He here characterizes the different impressions produced by this phenomenon. (3) The
relation between the conception of nature by thought and that which is effected by help of
the imagination. (4) Superstition and incredulity in their relations to the natural sciences.
(5) All existence considered as the empire of spirit. (6) The culture of the sciences rep-
resented as a worship offered to God.

‘Vol. II. (1) The relation of the natural sciences to poetry. (2) The relation of these
sciences to different important notions of religion. (3) Of the salutary influence which the
study and employment of the natural sciences must exert on the intellectual development of
man. (4) Two discourses on occasion of the reunion of the Scandinavian naturalists. (5)

a special manner to the honor of Oersted, by observing that, in him, the favors
of fortune never weakened his devotion to the duties of the savant, and that after
having made a discovery whose brilliancy rendered it difficult further to aug-
ment his reputation, he believed that he still owed to science and his country
the constant tribute of assiduous labor.

It was one of the happy events of Oersted’s life that he witnessed, in 1829,
under the reign of Frederic VI, the founding at Copenhagen of a Polytechnic
School. Of this he was named director, an honorable title which he retained
till his death. We will not examine whether this Polytechnic School, in which
courses were appropriated to the arts and trades, entirely resembled our own.
In such a country as Denmark, less extensive than civilized, it is necessary to
unite many branches in order to compose a solid faggot. The object was, in the
main, analogous, and the very name of the school was a memorial of the first
journey of Oersted to Paris, as well as an homage rendered to the celebrated
school of Monge and Fourcroy. In the Danish institution, Oersted continued to
profess physics till his last year, with unremitting zeal, animation and success.
As director, he treated the pupils with a mixture of kindness, sagacity and
firmness which secured their unreserved devotion and willing obedience.

During his third journey, Oersted found himself crossing the channel from
France to England, on his forty-sixth birthday, 14th August 1823; it is an anni-
versary which the people of the north style the day of one’s fete. Accustomed
in Denmark to pass it in the bosom of his family and friends, he was now left to
his solitary thoughts; and these naturally reverting to his country, inspired him

~ with the design of founding something on his return which should be at once a
profitable and pleasant memorial of the vows which on this occasion he addressed
to his distant home. ‘The plan of a society for the promotion of the study of
nature formed itself in his mind, and was so thoroughly wrought out during the
short navigation, that nothing was required on landing at Dover but to reduce
it to writing. The plan met with cordial acceptance in Denmark, and by aid of
the new association, courses of natural history were established not only at
Copenhagen, but in other cities of the country; nor has this institution since
ceased to bear the useful fruits which Oersted had anticipated.

He was also member of a literary society. In connection with this a monthly
publication was edited, in which he often inserted articles on the most varied
subjects, not excepting religious and philosophical ones. He belonged, more-
over, to an association established for the right use of the liberty of the press.
In fact, his co-operation seems to have been claimed almost universally at
Copenhagen, nor was a sense of its value without frequent manifestations in other
cities of Denmark, and even in those of the neighboring countries. _To the last,
he was accustomed to make numerous excursions as well into the north of Ger-.
many as into the Scandinavian peninsula, in attendance on the assemblages of
naturalists which were held at different places. It was a cherished idea of his
that, through these assemblages, not only might the exchange of scientific views
be facilitated and a more intimate union among the representatives of science be
cemented, but that their benefits might be extended to a wider circle by exposi-
tions placed within the reach of all and contributing to introduce, even among
the popular masses, the habit of comprehending and mutually exchanging their

idioms and forms of literature; especially was it his hope that the three Scan-

hundred years ago, the same that it is to-day;) the olive had in France, eighteen hundred
years ago, the same limit in the north which it has at present; the men of antiquity were
not stronger and attained not a more advanced age than those of modern times ; the human
race, far from retrograding, has made sensible progress in regard to morals. (7) The rela-
tion of the natu®al sciences to different ages and to their philosophy; * *” * Christianity
and mental cultivation as lending each other mutual support.”

The interest which this work excited in Germany led to its translation under the title
of Der Geist in der Natur, (The Soul in Nature). [It was also translated into English. ]
182 MEMOIR OF OERSTED.

dinavian nations might thus become, as it were, three branches drawing in com-
mon their intellectual nourishment from the same radical stock.

It was never the misfortune of Oersted to witness any diminution of reputa-
tion. In 18446, in the sixty-ninth year of his age, he again traveled into Ger-
many, France and England. In an interesting notice of Oersted read 7th Novem-
ber, 1851, before the Roy al Society of Sciences of Copenhagen, M. Forchham-
mer, who had accompanied him, tells us that this journey resembled an ovation.
In England, especially, Oersted was received by the most eminent politicians
and men of science with a distinction which has rarely been the portion of a
stranger, and, above all, of a simple savant. His purpose was to take part in
the meeting at Southampton of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science. In one of the sessions of that body, Sir John Herschel, made an
address to him, remarkable for the bigaal and intelligent justice which it ren-
dered to his scientific labors,

Honored in his public, Oersted was happy in his private life. His younger
brother, whom he had taught to read under the roof of the wig-maker of Rud-
kjébing, ever continued to be his faithful and inumate companion. The latter
had himself acquired great celebrity by his labors in philosophy and jurispru-
dence, and had filled the position of president of the Royal Society of Copen-
hagen. Only with the death of the elder brother terminated the auspicious
habit, contracted in childhood, of daily exchanging their impressions and ideas.
In 1814, Oersted had espoused Mademoiselle | Brigitte Ballum, daughter of a
Lutheran minister of Kjedby, in the isle of Méen, and found in her an accom-
plished companion, whose character, admirably adapted to his own, formed their
mutual happiness. Of five daughters and three sons born of this union, only
three of the former and two of the latter survived Oersted, to be the consolation
of their mother. One of his daughters is married to M. Sharling, professor of
chemistry in the University of Copenhagen, long known for important researches
on respiration.*

Around Oersted, however, there existed a still more extensive family. It was
composed, we might say, of the whole city of Copenhagen, where he was as
much loved as esteemed, as much esteemed as admired. Of this his fellow-
citizens gave him a touching proof in the latter days of his life. The day (7th
November, 1850) which marked the fiftieth anniversary of his entrance upon
public Patene and was what is called in the north his jubilee, was celebrated by
a general festival in Denmark, with the somewhat quaint forms of Teutonic
eood- fellowship, but accompanied by a substantial testimonial of gratitude to
the man who was regarded as the honor of the whole nation. It had been
determined by the friends, the pupils, and indeed the simple admirers of the phi-
losopher, to make this the occasion of securing to him for the remainder of his
life the possession of Fasanenhof, (Pheasant- -court,) a delightful summer resi-
dence in the garden of Fredericksburg. The choice of the dwelling was so
much the more delicate and so much the more pleasing to Oersted from its hav-
ing been previously the habitation of Ochlenschlager, the friend of his youth.

‘Oersted was conducted tiither on the day of his jubilee. At the same time
the King raised him to the rank of councillor of private conferences, a title
never before conferred on a professor of the university, and much higher than
that of councillor of ordinary conferences, which Oersted had borne for ten
years. His bust, executed by a celebrated statuary, was set up at Fasanenberg
in presence of an immense crowd, in which were intermingled the most illustrious
personages of the kingdom. ‘The rector of the university formally presented

MM. Andral and Gavarret on the same subject. (See Comptes Rendus of the Academy of
Sciences, t. xvii, p- 1205.) M. Alexandre Oersted, son of the celebrated jurist M. André
Sandée Oersted, and nephew of the renowned physicist, is at present professor of botany in

him with the gold ring of a doctor, on which was engraved a head of Minerva
encircled with diamonds. ‘The Seignior y of the association of students notified
him that he had been elected an honorary member of that society, and a depu-
tation of the Guild of arts and trades tendered him thanks for what he had done
in behalf of the industry of the country.

‘To all the discourses addressed to him Oersted replied with a force, a com-
posure and a choice of expressions which surprised the assistants. ‘The choir of
the students commenced and terminated the féte with a chant, the words of
which had been composed by one of the best poets of Denmark. In the even-
ing a procession with torches and a new chant by the students greeted the object
of this enthusiastic commemoration. :

The day on which classes so numerous and so diversified had vied with each
other in testifying for him their affection and admiration must have been to
Oersted one of the sweetest of his life. He had received from his sovereign and
his fellow-citizens the most exalted testimonials of esteem with which any Dan-
ish savant had been ever honored, and, in spite of his modesty, his conscience
could not have failed to insinuate to him that he was not unworthy of them.
The hope of passing his last years, surrounded by his family and dedicated to a
tranquil scientific activity, in the smiling retreat which his countrymen had
thought proper to offer him, was calculated to blend the satisfaction of the heart
with the consecration of his renown. Yet this pleasing hope was but a decep-
tive gleam, and although his mind, still vigorous, and his frame replete with life,
seemed yet to promise Jength of days, it was not granted to Oersted so much as
to take possession of his new domicil, for before the return of spring he had
ceased to live.

He died at Copenhagen, 9th March, 1851, at the age of seventy-three years and
seven months, removed unexpectedly and in but a few days, by a simple
catarrh contracted by studying of a morning in too cold an apartment. His
death was a profound and general grief for the city of Copenhagen and for all
Denmark.* In that grief, this Academy, in common with the whole scientific
world, bore no indifferent or simulated part.

Oersted was replaced in the list of our eight foreign associates by the cele-
brated chemist of Berlin, M. Mitscherlich, to whom crystallography is indebted
for the most important progress it has made since Haiiy. M. Mitscherlich had,
in his youth, associated himself with the labors of the Scandinavian scientific
school; and this choice, justified by other reasons, might be regarded as a new
and last homage rendered to the memory of Oersted as well as to that of Ber-
zelius.

No scientific body had been backward in crowning with its suffrage the great
discovery of Oersted. ‘To make an enumeration -of more than fifty societies
which inscribed his name among those of their correspondents or their foreign
associates, would be little less than to draw up a complete list of the princi ipal
Academies of the two hemispheres. More than one sovereign had been emulous
of associating himself with the movement of public opinion in his behalf. He
was advanced to the class of grand-cross of the Danish order of Danebrog,
grand-cross of the Swedish order of the Polar Star, member of the order of
Merit of Prussia, and officer of the Legion of Honor.

Oersted was not only eminent as a phy sicist, profound as a thinker, he was
aman of rare excellence of character. Author of one of thecapital discoveries of
the century, promoter of one of the schools which confer most honor on his country,
founder of many important scientific and literary institutions, dear to the youth
and to the public of Copenhagen, whom he had charmed during 50 years by a
system of poetic and philosophic ideas in harmony with their natural instincts,

he had never failed to avail himself of the credit which his high position in
science had given him with an enlightened government, and even of the friend-
ship of a well-informed King*, to render innumerable services to studious youth,
to savants less fortunate than himself, to a multitude of persons whom he recog-

nized as worthy of his countenance. Had his characteristic modesty not equaled —

his other merits, he also might have adopted the boast ascribed by a poet to his
hero:
Some little good I’ve done—it is my noblest work.

Translated for the Smithsonian Institution, from the ‘* Avchives des Sciences Physiques et
naturelles,’ Geneva ‘

The death of C. F. Schoenbein has sent a pang of regret not only through
Switzerland but through the scientific world. We cannot better fulfil the painful
duty of reviewing the life of this eminent man than by borrowing the following
pages from a notice published in the Basle Nachrichten, for which we are probably
indebted to the pen of Professor Hagenbach :

The mortal remains of Christian Frederic Schoenbein have been carried to
their last resting place. He has been so suddenly arrested in a life full of activity,
so abruptly called away, that we can hardly realize he has ceased to be among
us. These pages which we now consecrate to his memory can only faintly express
the sentiments awakened in us by the loss of one so much beloved and so much
mourned. 'The complete appreciation of his scientific career cannot be given in
a few rapid sketches.

Schoenbein was born the 18th of October, 1799, at Metzingen, Suabia. From
his parents he receiveda limited, though religious, education. He left the paternal
root at the early age of 14, in order to enter an establishment for the manufactory
of chemicals ; buta mere practical career could not satisfy his aspirations; the
occupation only awakened in his youthful mind an ardent desire for the more
elevated science of chemistry. He commenced the study of Latin, and went to
the universities of Tiibingen and Erlangen. After he had finished his studies at
the universities, he tanght chemistry and physics in a school at Keihan, near
Rudolstadt. Afterwards, he pursued his scientific education in England and in
France, and at length, in 1828, went to Basle, where he was installed as lecturei
on physics and chemistry. This office was formerly intrusted to Counsellos.
Merian, who still continues his active career among us. An attack of illness
obliged him to discontinue this course of instruction, by which he had rekindled
the love of those sciences which of old were so brilliantly represented at Basle
by such men as James and Daniel Bernoulli.

In 1835 Schoenbein was elected full professor of physics and chemistry in the
University of Basle, and discharged the duties of this position without interruption
until 1852, when the professorship was divided into two distinct chairs, he retaining
that of chemistry and continuing in it until the time of his death. Thus, Schoen-
bein has been connected with our university nearly 40 years, and has never, except
temporarily, during that period quitted Basle; his two longest journeys, the one
to England the other to Germany, are well known from the accounts of them
which he has published, and to which the mingling of serious and humorous
observations with scientific reflections and sketches of personal adventures give
a peculiar charm.

Schoenbein was married in the year 1835, but the tranquil happiness which
he found in domestic life was unfortunately disturbed by the sudden death of
his eldest daughter in 1859, an event which sadly afflicted his entire household.

His energies were unreservedly consecrated to science, and he always remained
faithful to the counsels of his master, the celebrated Schelling, who taught him
to regard her as his bride. ‘Thus all his faculties, all his efforts were continually
exerted to draw nearer each day to scientific trath, and to penetrate ever more
profoundly into the mysteries of the forces which govern the changes of the
186 NOTICE OF CHRISTIAN FREDERIC SCHOENBEIN,

material universe. He worked with ardor and an indefatigable perseverance,
and all the time he could command was employed in his experiments; even the
short wintry days found him at early morn in his laboratory. When astonish-
ment was expressed that one of his advanced age should be so eager in the pur-
suit of science, he was wont to say, with a smile, that he knew “there remained
for him but little time in which to work, and that there was still much flax upon
his distaff.”

He preserved to the end all the freshness of his faculties as well as the juvenile
enthusiasm with which from the first he had made known his discoveries to his
colleagues and to the scientific world.

Among the works of Schoenbein we may first mention those which relate to
subjects which are neither entirely physical nor entirely chemical, but which
rather appertain to both, such as his researches upon the passivity of iron and
of other metals ; the changes of color of bodies under the influence of temperature ;
the chemical action of luminous rays, and finally the theory of voltaic electricity.
In this latter domain he has thrown much light upon the well-known controversy
relative to the theory of contact and chemical action; in studying with impar-
tiality the two opposite opinions, and in demonstrating wherein they were faulty:
He ascribes the origin of voltaic electricity to chemical action, although he showed
a positive difference between the electricity developed in the open current of the
battery and that which produces the curent and the chemical decomposition
which are manifested when the current is closed.

His researches on the voltaic current date from 1836 to 1840; since that epoch
his views relative to the source of the voltaic current have become gradually
adopted by physicists in general. In 1839, while in England at the meeting of
the British Association, he made the personal acquaintance of the celebrated
English lawyer and physicist, Grove, who presented at the session a small voltaic
battery, of which the cells were constructed of the bowls of tobacco pipes; this
was the first exhibition of the celebrated constant battery which bears the name
of its inventor. As Schoenbein had been engaged on a similar investigation,
we soon see the two physicists pursuing the same object. They planned one of
these batteries of large size, and thus produced an apparatus which, in proportion
to its dimensions, exhibited an unusual electro-motive force. This first large
constant battery is still preserved in the Museum of Physics at Basle, a souvenir of
Schoenbein and of Heussler, a friend of science brought up among us, who bore
the expense of its construction and gave it to our academy. 'The possession of
this apparatus gave to Schoenbein a fresh incentive to resume with new energy
his researches upon the relations of electric and chemical forces. Thanks to this
battery it became possible to decompose water into its elements in greater quan-
tities than had ever before been done; it was during an experiment of this kind
that, in the autumn of 1839, he per ceived a peculiar odor from the oxygen obtained
by the decomposition of water similar to that produced when a large electrical
machine is in active operation, or when a discharge of lightning ‘takes place
between a cloud and the earth. This odor he at first attributed to a new sub-
stance mixed in small quantities with the oxygen, and as this body ought to have
a special name, after consulting with his colleague, M. W. Kischer, he gave it
that of ozone.

His first publication of the discovery of ozone excited but little attention in the
scientific world. But nowise disheartened by this, he continued his investigations
with a persistency only to be met with among those who are thoroughly possessed
with a subject. He pursued during 29 years, or what may be considered the
active life of a man, the same end, the study of the chemical properties of oxygen ;
a labor which, though it might appear to lead to no valuable results, is really
connected with the properties of one ot the most important elements of our globe.

In consequence of his.own researches and those of other physicists, Schoenbein
was soon forced to renounce the idea that ozone was an elementary substance, and

2

torecognize in it a peculiar condition of oxygen in which it is endowed with
special properties.

We cannot here enumerate the many discoveries connected with this subject,
and still less retrace the important steps that have been made in the domain of
chemistry and of physiology in connection with it; we must limit ourselves to
the remark that Schoenbein has contributed much to enlarge the field of science
in this direction, and as the names of Priestley, Scheele, and Lavoisier are men-
tioned in connection with the early discoveries relative to oxygen, so the name
of Schoenbein will always be recalled when we speak of the new form under
which this element appears, and the varied action, when thus changed, it pro-
duces upon organic and inorganic bodies,

Among the discoveries which have rendered Schoenbein known, even beyond
the scientific world, we must mention that of gun-cotton.’ This substance was
not doomed merely to administer to the malevolent passions of men, and to play
adestructive part in war, as its name would seem to indicate; the subsequent dis-
covery of Schoenbein gave it functions of a mgre pacific character ; a solution of
gun-cotton in ether forms collodion, an admirable dressing for wounds, and a pre-
cious ingredient in the art of photography. The first application of collodion as a
medicinal agent was made at the instance of Schoenbein by his friend, Dr.
Jung, of Basle.

The tardiness that Schoenbein found in the acceptance of his ideas on their
first presentation was afterwards fully compensated by the approbation they
received from all parts of the scientific world. The most distinguished philoso-
phers of Germany, of France, and of England adopted essentially by his views, and
several learned societies, among others the academies of France and Munich,
elected him a corresponding member.

His manner of working deserves to be noticed. However important the results
at which he arrived, the means that he employed for obtaining them were extremely
simple. ‘There is no doubt that the great progress male in modern times in the
construction of apparatus and instruments of research has had an important influ-
ence on the development of science, but the investigations of Schoenbein show
us what can be effected, at least in some lives, without the aid of costly appliances.

Schoenbein was so much occupied with his special researches that it is not
Surprising he did not keep entirely posted up in the general progress of chemistry.
Though he by no means confined himself exclusively to the special objects of
his investigations, yet he could not give to other branches that study which was
necessary to render them fully appreciated. He did not adopt the views and the
methods of the leading chemists of this day; he often compared the production
of the varied combinations of the same elements with the rotation of a kaleidoscope,
giving constantly new images, doubtless amusing, but not very instructive. He
also frequently compared chemical phenomena to a theatrical exhibition, in which
many regard only the denouement of the last act, while it is often in the develop-
ment of the drama that the most interesting truths are exhibited. In the judg-
ment which he formed of the ideas of other philosophers, Schoenbein may have
been at times somewhat prejudiced. ‘The vivacity of his mind often presented to
him in too strong a light the defects in the conceptions of others, while the pre-
occupation of his thoughts with his own ideas left him no time to reflect upon them
with calmness and impartiality.

[is peculiarity as a professor will remain as a precious souvenir to many. It
follows, from what we have said relative to his manner of work, that his specialty
was not to exhibit the actual state of science and to deduce from it the various
theories which have been devised. The most remarkable feature of his course
was the ardor of his connection and the clearness with which he discussed his
favorite subjects ; it was not only instruction in science but also the love of science
itself that he imparted to his pupils, and for which many among them will always
remember him with gratitude.
188 NOTICE OF CHRISTIAN FREDERIC SCHOENBEIN, ETC.

Schoenbein did not limit his instruction to the course of the university ; he under-
stood in the best possible manner how to impart his knowledge to others. Above
all, we should speak of the activity which he imparted to the Society of Natural
Sciences of Basle, of which, during 40 years, he was a prominent member ; he con-
sidered it as a dear friend, to whom he always first confided his most important
discoveries. The published proceedings of this society give the entire series of
the results of his scientific labors. ‘The Helvetic Society of Natural Sciences lost
in him one of its most zealous and valued members; he almost always animated
the meetings of the physical section by interesting communications, and this year,
at the session of Einsiedeln, his absence was noticed and deeply regretted; the
society, feeling the want of his cheering presence, transmitted to him by tele-
graph a friendly salutation ; alas, this found him upon a sick bed, soon to become
his bed of death. All the inhabitants of Basle, interested in sciences, were
indebted to him for the series of interesting lectures which he addressed to the
public of that city. In former days he gave complete courses of popular instruc-
tion, and in later years he did not refuse to share the efforts of younger men in
the organizations for the same purpose. But his enthusiasm for instructing
extended beyond the confines of the lecture-room, in society, in the street, even
at the refreshment saloons he knew how to give a scientific turn to conversation
without assuming the pedantic tone of a master. Schoenbein knew how to gain
the hearts of all by his amiable qualities, and consequently numbered many
friends. But his general popularity did not prevent him from contracting close
friendships, to which he remained faithful during life; he was intimately attached to
several of his colleagues, of whom some have preceded him to the tomb ; the youngest
of his associates felt that it was not only benevolence but a true friendship which
attached him to them. Among the foreign philosophers with whom he was on
terms the most intimate, and with whom_he regularly corresponded, we may
mention Faraday, Grove, Liebig, Wéhler, Eisenlohr, Pettenhofer, Sainte Claire
Deville, and Sebetellen de Metz, author of a well-known work on ozone.

The meetings of the Helvetic Society furnished him the opportunity of inter-
course with the savants of Switzerland. He was particularly associated with
M. M. Escher, Studer de la Rive, Pictet, Heir, Desor, Lang, and many younger
philosophers who also shared his ‘friendship.

If we would sum up in asingle sentence the character of Schoenbein, we should
say that at all points of view “he represented an individual of peculiar develop-
ment; he was an original in the best sense of the term, and such men ought to be
more appreciated, as they become ever more rare in our age of universal medi-
ocrity. Schoenbein was a complete man, for although an absorbing idea, the
love of science, governed his entire life, yet, all his other faculties had received
an entire and vigorous development. His general health was good; he was
hardened against exterior influences. It is but a short time since he worked
during the middle of winter in an unheated laboratory. For several years he
suffered occasionally from attacks of gout, from which, however, he always com-
pletely recovered. On this account he ’ resorted, during the vacation of last
summer, to Wildbad, thinking to fortify himself for the approaching winter. In
returning, however, he was detained at Sauersberg, near Baden Baden, at the
house of a friend by an abscess on his neck, which, rapidly. assuming a dangerous
character, rendered his return home impossible. The greatest care and medical
aid could not arrest the march of this disease, and on the 29th of August he died
peacefully in the house of his kind and attentive host. His obsequies took place
at Basle, the 2d of September. ‘The funeral was conducted by friends, among
whom was Eisenlohr, who had visited him on his death-bed. <A long train of
colleagues, pupils, relations, and admirers accompanied him with emotions of
deep sorrow to his last resting place.
APPENDIX TO NOTICE OF SCHOENBELN.

[The phenomenon called passivity of metals mentioned in the foregoing eulogy
as one of the discoveries of Schoenbein, consists in the fact that iron, for example,
which, under ordinary conditions, is readily disolved in nitric acid, may while in
a peculiar state remain for weeks in the same liquid without being acted on.
This phenomenon is, without doubt, due to a galvanic action, which, when the
iron is first plunged into the liquid deposits a coating of oxide which protects
the metal from the further action of the acid. ‘To illustrate this let a piece of
clean iron wire be immersed in strong nitric acid together with a slip of platinum,
the former being introduced first and the two connected with the ends of the wire
of a galvanometer, a powerful current will be inducted at the first completion of
the circuit, the iron acting as the positive metal, but the strength of this current
will quickly decline to a small amount and then remain constant for several
days. The iron thus treated is no longer attacked when plunged alone into
nitric acid, and is said to be passive. Instead of using a galvanometer, which
was merely introduced to prove the existence of a galvanic current, the same
effect will be produced by touching the iron wire while the acid is acting on
it with a piece of gold or platinum, also immersed in the liquid, the action will
immediately cease and the iron become passive. When an iron wire in the
passive state is plunged into nitric acid and the upperend touched with another iron
Wire, as soon as dipped into the acid the latteralso becomes passive. In these experi-
ment, the iron, which is rendered passive, acts as the zinc element of a galvanic
pair, andis rapidly covered with an oxide which protects it from further action except
of a very feeble character. In this state it may serve as the copper or negative
metal of a galvanic pair, and really performs this part in the second experiment
in which a galvanic couple is formed by the contact, while in the acid, of the
passive and non-passive iron. The formation of an oxide sufficiently thick to
protect the iron is not produced in nitric acid, of ordinary strength, unless a gal-
vanic arrangement such as we have described is adopted, but if it be plunged into
very strong acid the action, though violent for an instant, will soon cease, and the
metal assume the passive condition. If this wire be withdrawn from the acid
and exposed to the air for a short time, or rubbed with sandpaper, it will resume
its ordinary state. An iron wire may also be rendered passive by holding it for
a few minutes in the flame of a spirit lamp.

Other metals—namely, silver, copper, tin, aluminum, and especially bismuth,
may be brought into the passive state by the methods we have mentioned, but
the effect is not as marked as with iron. Dr. Hare constructed a galvanic
battery in which the platinum was represented by iron in the passive state, but
the action was capricious; though at one moment powerful at another it became
almost nothing.

Another discovery of Schoenbein, mentioned in the foregoing sketch, is that
of gun-cotton, a very explosive substance, produced by steeping cotton-wool in
fuming nitric acid, or in a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, afterwards washing
and drying the product. This discovery was,announced by Schoenbein in 1845,
but the mode of preparation was kept secret. It was, however, soon rediscovered
independently by Bettger and Otto, while Kopt improved the process of pro-
duction by the addition of sulphuric acid to the active liquid. From the first it
was proposed as a substitute for gunpowder, over which it possesses the advan-
tages of burning without smoke, and leaving no residuum to foul the chamber of
the cannon. Large establishments were erected for its preparation, but the
190 NOTICE OF SCHOENBEIN. ’

occurrence of several severe accidents during its production, attended with great
loss of life, caused it to be regarded as too dangerous for military purposes, “and,
accordingly, its manufacture was for a time almost abandoned. * Within the last
few years, ‘how ever, the attempt to make use of it as a substitute for gunpowder
has been renewed ‘and brought to a successful issue by an Austrian officer of
artillery.

Gun-cotton is used in military operations in the form of a spun yarn, in which
it conducts combustion slowly i in the open air at a rate of not more than one
foot per second. ‘This yarn is used to form cartridges for large guns, by being
wound round a bobbin, so as to form a hollow spindle and thus give an interior
surface for the action of the flame and the production of the most effective explo-
sion. The effect of the explosion of gun-cotton under water is remarkable; the
action is so instantaneous that the water has no time to yield, and consequently
transmits the impulse as a solid material; hence it is unnecessary to place the
charge in immediate contact with the body to be destroyed. In one experiment
two parallel rows of piers, 10 inches thick, in water 13 feet deep, with stones
between them, were blown to pieces by a barrel of 100 pounds of gun-cotton,
placed at a distance of three feet from one side and eight feet under water. It
raade a breach of 15 feet, and threw the water to a height of 200 feet. In another
experiment with 400 pounds of gun-cotton a vessel was blown up, the pieces pro-
jected into the air to a height of 400 feet, and the fishes for nearly half a mile
around were so stunned as to float on the water. The rapidity of expansion and
great elastic force of gun-cotton renders it a valuable agent in blasting. Its
power when exerted against a great resistance, as in the case of splitting a rock,
when compared with that of gunpowder, is in the ratio of 64 to 1.

The discovery which has rendered the name of Schoenbein most snhenaively
known is that of ozone. Before the end of the last century Van Marum, of Hol-
land, had observed that when an electric discharge was passed through oxygen
the latter acquired a peculiar smell and the power of attacking mercury, but it
was not until 1840 that any notice was taken of these facts, when Schoenbein
published his first paper on ozone. In this he announced the fact that in the
decomposition of water, by means of a galvanic battery, an odorous gas was given
off at the positive pole, and that this might be preserved for a long time in a
well-closed vessel. He also pointed out the fact of the similarity of this odor to
that which accompanies a discharge of electricity, especially from points, and
also the slow oxidation of phosphorus. Opinions as to the cause of the odor
were long divided, but through the experiments of Schoenbein and the investi-
gations of Andrews, and Tait, and others, it is now generally referred to oxygen
in a changed or allotropic condition.

One of the simplest methods of exhibiting the production of ozone consists in
transmitting a current of oxygen through a glass tube, into the sides of which a
pair of platinum wires have been sealed, with their points a small distance apart.
On connecting one of these wires with the prime conductor of an electric machine,
in active operation, while the other is connected with the ground, the odor of
ozone is immediately perceptible in the stream of gas. But in order to produce
a maximum effect it is necessary to transmit the discharge silently in the form of
a brush or a star, since sparks appear to produce an opposite effect, and are,
therefore, to be avoided. Ozonized air may also be obtained by placing a stick
of clean, moist phosphorus in a bottle of air or oxygen, when, after an hour or
so, the smell of ozone will be obvious. The stick of phosphorus is then to be
taken out and the gas washed with water to remove the phosphorous acid. Or
ozone may at once be produced by plunging a heated glass rod into a mixture
of air and a vapor of ether. The galvanic decomposition of water acidulated
with sulphuric acid, or better, perhaps, with the addition of chromic acid, affords
at the positive pole a large supply of ozone. 'The general characteristics of
ozone are those of an oxydizing agent; it corrodes organic matter, as shown in

its energetic action on the caoutchoue tubes through which it is conducted. It
bleaches most vegetable colors; it changes the black sulphide of lead into white
sulphate, the yellow ferrocyanide of potassium into the red ferrocyanide. It oxy-
dizes moist filings of iron, copper, mercury, and silver. In some cases, however,
ozone acts as a deoxy dizing agent. It decomposes peroxide of iron and barium,
It exists in variable quantities sin the atmosphere, and its presence is indicated
by what is called ozone test-paper, namely, paper steeped in iodine of potassium,
which is rendered brown by the liberation of the iodine. If starch be added to
the solution in which the paper is steeped the ozone produces a blue color; but
according to some authorities this test is not as reliable as that of the solution
of the iodide of potassium alone. As ozone is an energetic oxydizing agent, it
combines with animal matter and other impurities in the air, and “hence ‘its
absence, as evinced by the want of coloration in the test-paper, is considered as
an indication of the presence of malaria in the atmosphere of the locality in
which such indications are observed. It is evident from what has been stated
that ozone must be produced in the atmosphere by electrical discharges, but
whether it exists from other sources in the air is at present unknown. Neither
are the test-papers we have mentioned decisive proofs of its relative quantity,
since there are other substances generally present in the air which are competent
to produce similar effects.

One of the most plausible hypotheses as to the nature of ozone is that of Clan-
sius, who considers all gases, whether simple or compound, as made up of a num-
ber of atoms combined together to form molecules. That, for instance, a mole-
cule of oxygen consists of at least two atoms, and that it may happen that a
portion of each of the great number of molecules which exists in a given quantity
of oxygen can be decomposed into two atoms which distribute themselves in
their separate state among the remaining undecomposed molecules, and that
these isolated atoms, which in their relations to foreign bodies must differ from
the molecules of ordinary oxygen, constitute ozone.

In accordance with this hypothesis, the production of ozone by passing elec-
tricity through oxygen or atmospheric air may be attributed simply to the repul-
sive power of the electricity by virtue of which the two atoms of oxygen, being
charged with the same kind of electricity, are driven apart, as in the case of the
well known experiment of two pith-balls. When oxygen is evolved in the
decomposition of water, a similar repulsive separation takes place at each pole
or electrode, but most of the atoms immediately combine again upon the elec-

trodes to form ordinary oxygen. A small portion only of the atoms remain ina
separate condition, and these constitute thé ozone with which the oxygen is
mixed. Finally, in the case in which ozone is developed during the oxidation
of phosphorus in moist air or oxygen, we may suppose that the atoms which
make up the oxygen molecules are in different states or degrees of electricity ;
that one of these tends more energetically to combine with the phosphorus than
the other; and that the latter, removed from the sphere of its attraction by
the heat generated in the combination of the former, remains in an isolated con-
dition. The fact that these atoms do not immediately recombine into molecules
to form ordinary oxygen may be due to their similar electrical state. When
ozonized air is heated, the ozone disappears, because the high temperature deter-
mines the union of the atoms ‘as it does of hydrogen and oxygen in the
application of a flame to a mixture of these two gases. It has ‘been found
that the ozonification of oxygen by the electrical spark or brush can only be
carried on to a certain extent if the ozone remain mixed with the oxygen; but if
the ozone be removed as rapidly as it is formed by the oxidation of silver , all
the oxygen may be gradually converted into ozone. In this case, when the
number of separate atoms become too great in a given space, they are brought
within the sphere of mutual attraction ; combination ensues, and the ozone dis-
192 NOTICE OF SCHOENBEIN.

appears as fast as it is produced in the reproduction of ordinary oxygen. The
power of combination with metals and other bodies exhibited by ozone becomes
a consequence of this hypothesis, inasmuch as separate atoms must from analogy
have more combining power with foreign bodies than atoms which are already
in combination with each other.

The hypothesis of Clausius is ‘very suggestive, and with a few supplementary
assumptions can be made not only to render a plausible explanation of known
phenomena, but also to indicate new experiments. It must be stated, however,
that it is at variance, as presented in the foregoing sketch, with the experiments
of Soret on the density of ozone. This chemist finds, from an elaborate inves-
tigation, that when ordinary oxygen is converted into ozone its density is
increased instead of being diminished, as it should be, according to the hypoth-
esis of Clausias. This result was arrived at by two different methods, that of
absorption and that of diffusion. Both gave approximately the same result,
from which it appears that the density of ozone is one and a half times that of oxy-
gen. According tothe hypothesis of Clausius a molecule of oxygen consists of two
atoms, and may be represented by 00, while an atom of ozone would be indica~-
ted by 0. From this it is evident that the density of ozone should be only one-
half of that of oxygen. In order to make the hypothesis of Clausius agree with
the result obtained by Soret, we must suppose that while an element of oxygen
consists of two atoms, and is represented by 00, an element of ozone con-
sists of three atoms represented by 00,0; that when by electrical repulsion oy
other action, the two atoms of oxygen are separated, one of them immediately
unites with a molecule of ordinary oxygen and the other to a second molecule,
forming two molecules of ozone out of three molecules of oxygen. Or, in other
words, by the decomposition of one of three molecules 00 00 00 of oxygen, and
recomposition with the remaining two, we shall have two molecules 00,0 00,0 of
ozone. It is not necessary that we should limit a molecule of oxygen to two
atoms; on the contrary, we may suppose that it consists of an indefinite number
provided we admit that under the action of electricity or other forces it is
divided into two portions, each containing an equal number of atoms. In the
present state of science, if we adopt the atomic constitution of matter, we must
consider what was formerly assumed as the ultimate atoms of bodies, as groups’
of atoms held in relative position by attracting and repelling forces. It is only
by an assumption of this kind that we are enabled to obtain a mechanical con-
ception of matter in any degree applicable to various chemical and physical
phenomena. | J. H.
MEMOIR OF ENCKHE.

By G. HAGEN.

Translated for the Smithsonian Institution by C. A. Alexander*

Last year died the director of our observatory, Professor Encke. Besides his
other scientific and serviceable labors, he acted for eight and thirty years as
secretary of the physico-mathematical classof our Academy, and during that long
interval administered the affairs pertaining to the office with the utmost dis-
interestedness, skill and discretion.

Johann Franz Encke was born in Hamburg, September 23, 1791. His
father, archdeacon in the Jacobi-church at that place, died four years afterwards.
Although his mother brought to the rearing of her eight children remarkable
energy of character, yet the moderate pension which the family still drew from
the church by no means sufficed for the expense of extensive studies.

As a preparation tor the business of life Encke first resorted to a private school
kept by Hipp, the author of several mathematical works, and later, from 1805
to 1810, frequented the Johanneum, where Hipp was still his teacher. Under
these circumstances he very early developed a singular predilection for mathe-
matical studies. At this time he voluntarily imposed on himself the task of
repeatedly going over the collection of problems propounded by Meyer-Hirsch,
and is stated in the parting certificate awarded him, October 11, 1810, to have
been a model to his school-fellows for diligence, correctness of deportment, and
modesty.

It was now that he expressed to his mother the wish to study astronomy, and
his two elder brothers, who had entered into trade and who recognized his talent,
devoted themselves to the furtherance of his purpose, which they were enabled
to gratify through the intervention of the pastor, Schafer. During a year he
attended a gymnasium in Hamburg, and proceeded in 1811, shortly after the
death of his mother, to Géttingen. Here an older fellow-countryman named
Gerling introduced him to Gauss, whom he was accustomed afterwards to regard
as pre-eminently his instructor, and to whom he referred almost exclusively his
mathematical and astronomical culture. Esvecially instructive did he consider
an entirely private course (privatissimum) which, together with Gerling, he
attended in the summer of 1812, at the residence of Gauss, who, on his own
part, in a letter to Schumacher of this date, already calls Encke “ his highly
accomplished and well-informed pupil.”

Political events led Encke, in the beginning of 1813, to enter into the Han-
seatic artillery service. He was engaged in the bloody fight for the fortress of
Géhrde, September 16, where Wallmoden attacked and defeated the corps
which Davoust had despatched thither under Pecheux. He also took part, the
following month, in 'Tettenborn’s bold advance upon Bremen. In the honorable
discharge granted him, June 24, 1814, he is styled sergeant-major of cavalry.

He resumed his studies in Gottingen, but as the war broke out anew the fol-
lowing spring, he at once decided, in company with his younger brother who

194 MEMOIR OF ENCKE.

was studying theology, to serve under the Prussian standard. He seems to have
affixed to his offer of service a testimonial wherein Gauss certifies that Encke
had “at first attended and afterwards borne an active part in his manifold astro-
nomical occupations and labors, and had manifested throughout distinguished
talent, great diligence, and uncommon knowledge.” ‘The brothers were required
to undergo an examination, which, in the case > of our astronomer, at least, was
never repeated. He received, June 10, 1815, the commission of second heu-
tenant of artillery, and was first ordered to Thorn, and later to Graudenz.

Encke would, probably, like his brother, have still further pursued a military
career had not Von Lindenau, the director of the Seeberg observatory, at the
recommendation of Gauss and Gerling, offered him in the beginning of 1816 the
place of adjunct therein. ‘This induced him to ask a discharge from the army,
which was accorded on the 8th of March. Hereupon he went once more to
Géttingen, and remained there till July 5, 1816, when his nomination to the
observatory was confirmed. The appointment was by no means dazzling. ‘The
salary was but $15 a month, and the place of service consisted of a garret so
lowly that he touched the ceilmg when he raised his hand above his head. Not
the less did there go forth from hence such labors as soon turned the general
attention on the young astronomer. With so much zeal did Encke apply him-
self to his duties that ‘only once a week did he leave the observatory and go to
Gotha.

He first occupied himself with the newly discovered small planets, especially
Vesta, whose orbit he traced with superior accuracy, and of whose apparent motion
he published the ephemerides. Another labor, if one of subordinate importance,
was not without consequence by placing him in friendly correspondence with
Bessel. The Fundamenta Astronomia had been printed at Gotha, and Lindenan,
on whom the correction of the press devolved, transferred this task to his assistant.
Encke, however, did not confine himself to a comparison of the manuscript with
the impression, but repeated the calculations. Hence Bessel s says, in the preface
to his work, “Mr. Encke, who occupies the second place in the Seeberg
observatory, but who would be an ornament to the first, has given himself with
unsurpassed skill to the revision of the imprint, even to the detection and cor-
rection of the errors of the manuscript. I must acknowledge this with the more
thankfulness, inasmuch as bis timeis worthily occupied with his own astronomical
researches, and between us no other bond exists than that which embraces all
who devote themselves with zeal to the same science.”

The first of the more important labors of Encke relates to the comet of 1812.*

This had been observed for two months at all the greater observatories. Encke
had, at his first residence in Gottingen, and therefore immediately on the appear-
ance of the comet, begun the calculation which, in the well-considered and careful
employment of numerous observations and the exact execution of extended com-
putations, takes rank with the most admirable investigations of this nature. It
was crowned with a special result, since an elliptical orbit corresponded with
the revolution of nearly 71 years.

How important this discovery was considered at that time is seen from a letter
of Bessel’s: “You have adduced the strongest proof for the shortness of the
revolution of this comet, and placed the result in the clearest light. We have
now, since we begin more narrowly to observe and to calculate the comets, quite
other views to maintain. Halley’s comet seemed only to be an exception. As
regards that of Olbers, I scarcely trusted my own calculation, as this gave but a
middling revolution. Yours is now the third. Our successors , through an exact
investigation of the planet-masses, will be enabled to recognize the true move-

fo)
ment of the heavenly bodies witha perfection of which we have scarcely an idea.”

‘MEMOIR OF ENCKE. 195

Encke immediately thereafter addressed himself to a similar yet more tronble-
some inquiry. The editors of the Zeitschrift fiir Astronomie had chosen as the
thesis for the prize offered by Cotta, the computation of the orbit of the comet of
1680. This comet, on account of its luminosity, the length of its tail, which
comprised 80 degrees, as well as the duration of its visibility, had presented one
of the grandest phenomena of which the history of the heavens makes mention.
It had been extensively observed by the astronomers of the period, especially
by Flamsteed, Newton, and Cassini, though the observations had been limited
to the measurement of the distances of the fixed stars, and the comets’ place had
been in part only estimated, inasmuch as the observers had been content to sup-
pose the body bisected by two great circles drawn through four neighboring
stars, which circles only approximately touched it.

Encke wrote to Bessel that, at the special request of Lindenau, he would attempt
the solution of the problem, and with this view requested the communication of
a number of stellar positions from the catalogue of Bradley. With this request
Bessel at once complied, but expressed the apprehension that the result would
scarcely justify the expenditure of time, as he deemed the observations too uncertain.
And, indeed, of so large a number of measurements there were but few that
were available. In many cases it was even uncertain from what fixed stars the
distances were measured. Nevertheless it was found, on critical examination, that
Flamsteed’s observations disclosed a high degree of accuracy, since their probable
errors amounted to but 15 seconds of are spherical. With due regardto planetary
disturbances this orbit was also shown to be elliptical, and the period of revolu-
tion was found to be 8,813 years.

Gauss cordially congratulated Encke “on this admirable prize essay, to which
he was indebted for so much pleasure.” Bessel expressed himself in more
specific terms: “It is without example that the more ancient observations have
been reduced to so small a probable error. We learn from this, that to a good
astronomical result there is indispensable, besides a tolerably good instrument and
a capable observer, an able calculator also. If the last be wanting, the rest is
little worth.”

Together with these great labors Encke occupied himself in many ways with
the incidental calculation of cometary orbits. As often as one was discovered,
and had been for some time observed, he was accustomed to publish, not only
its orbital elements, but, to facilitate further observations, its ephemeris as well.
The constant practice and fine perception which guided him in the choice and
grouping of the observations enabled him to arrive with wonderful certainty at
a correct result. Ayvemarkable example of this was furnished by the third comet
of 1819, for which Encke, from some scanty Marseillese and a few Milanese
observations, so accurately caleulated the elements of an elliptic orbit and a
revolution of 54 years, that on the re-discovery of the comet at the Bonn obser-
vatory after seven revolutions (in the year 1848) no important qualifications were
almissible. This practical knowledge and perspicacity led, no doubt, to the
discovery through which Encke’s name is most generally known.

A comet was discovered November 26, 1818, by Pons at Marseilles, the path
of which, as Olbers soon remarked, was nearly coincident with that of the comet
of 1795 and 1805. It had been already surmised that the orbit was elliptical
and the period of revolution short beyond example. The elucidation of this
remarkable circumstance was probably undertaken by many astronomers, though
it was Encke who first succeeded in shedding complete light upon it. ‘The time
of revolution amounted to 1,207 days, or nearly 34 years, and it was this comet
respecting which Bessel had expressed a conjectural opinion that it moved in an
elliptical orbit.*

genius” which Encke had lavished on the calculations. Bessel, who had heard
of the comet during an absence from Kénigsberg, wrote to one of his scholars:
“Tt becomes clearer and clearer that this comet is the most important scientific
discovery of the present century.” Olbers also expressed himself in the same
terms in a letter to Bessel.

Although the short period was in itself of the most pregnant consequence as
affording the prospect of a more certain determination of the masses of the planets
which exert an influence on the comet, yet further investigation soon led the way
to another wholly unexpected result. Encke found, in effect, that this comet
had been observed, also, in 1786, and hence four times in all, while no less than
seven times in the interval its return had not been noticed. From a comparison
of the three intervals -between the observed transits it resulted, with all due
allowance for the planetary disturbances, that each revolution, as regards the
next preceding one, had been shortened by about three hours.

Olbers was the first to conjecture that the comet encountered a certain resist-
ance whereby its approximation to the sun, and, consequently, the shortening of
its period of revolution might be accounted for. Encke concurred in this view,
while Bessel dissented from it. In the correspondence between the two, the
reasons for and against the hypothesis were, for many years, fully discussed.
In 1830 Bessel writes: ‘ What admirable results are yielded by careful labor
is now again seen in the conformableness of that unknown disturbance which
you call resistance. Of the existence of such disturbance there can be no doubt,
nor could there be long ago, but that it is a real resistance becomes more /proble-
matical to me the more I reflect upon it.”

Encke continued assiduously to observe this comet, which he always called
the comet of Pons, though his own name was, with perfect justice, commonly
applied to it. Before each of its returns he made known its ephemeris in order
to facilitate observation, and as the shortening of the period of revolution con-
stantly recurred, in which fact he saw a confirmation of the above hypothesis, he
developed, in 1831, his theory of the movement of heavenly bodies in the resisting
medium. For the constants introduced, the values admitted of determination
from foregoing observations.

Halley’s comet, which re-appeared in 1835 after a period of 76 years, occupied
very exactly the same positions which Rosenberger had previously calculated
from the earlier observations. By this body, therefore, the hypothesis of the
resisting medium was not confirmed, though it was by no means decidedly con-
tradicted, because neither the earlier measurements nor the masses of the planets
relied upon as a ground of calculation could be regarded as altogether certain;
perhaps, also, this comet might have a denser mass, and the effects of resistance
be on that account not so conspicuous.

The comet discovered still later by Faye seemed at last to remove the doubt
previously existing. The period of this body, 74 years, was, according to M6l-
ler’s computation, shortened at each revolution by about 17 hours, and Encke
showed (Lerliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch fiir 1864) that this acceleration could,
with very close approximation, be explained by the resistance which the comet
of shorter circuit had undergone. In the meantime Méller communicated the
results of a more rigorous calculation, (Astronomische Nachrichten, vol. 64, p.
145,) in which were considered those quantities of the second order in the
co-ordinates of the disturbances which arise from the changes sustained by the
elements through the addition of new fundamental places at the more recent
returns. By this it was found possible to bring all the three phenomena into
harmony without the assumption of the resisting medium. ‘The errors remaining
over were, through this procedure, it is true, considerably greater than after the
first calculation, but Moller entertained the hope of being able, by a renewed
and stricter calculation, to attain a still closer conformity. Whether, therefore,
Faye’s comet does or does not confirm the hypothesis of the resisting medium,

or, in more general terms, that of a yet unknown cause operating upon both
comets, still remains undecided.

Two other important investigations of Encke related to the sun’s parallax, as
derived from the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, the last of which Cook
had observed at Tahiti. After correction of the observations, revised by
Father Hell in Vienna, Encke found the parallax to be 8.57 seconds. . “ You
have turned to account,” wrote Bessel, “what had been collected by the expen-
diture of vast sums and by the efforts of many, and thus those efforts have first
achieved success and still point onward to a step in advance.” This magnitude
of the parallax was for a long time generally accepted ; but subsequently, from
the opposition of Mars and the disturbances of the moon, was estimated at 8.9
seconds. The difference between this value and that found by Encke arose
from the circumstance that the position of the places of observation was not
ascertained with the requisite precision. After a more accurate determination of
this point in later times, the sun’s parallax, as deduced from those old observa-
tions, has been shown by Powalky to amount to only 8.832 seconds.*

Encke’s personal position had so far changed, soon after his accession to the
observatory, that the charge of its management had devolved on him, at first
partially, through the intermitting attendance of Lindenau, and soon wholly,
from the absorption of the latter in administrative affairs. As no other duties
claimed his time, Encke could now resign himself to scientific labor with free and
entire devotion. ‘The value which he placed upon this rare immunity is seen
