JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, January 11, 1888.

The stated annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithso-
nian Institution was held this day at 10:30 o’clock A. M.

Present: Chief-Justice M. R. WArrsE, Chancellor of the Institution,
Hon. 8. 8S. Cox, Hon. W. W. PHELPS, Hon. JOSEPH WHEELER, Dr.
HENRY CopPEE, Dr. J. B. ANGELL, Dr. J. C. WELLING, General M.
C. MEIGS, and the Secretary, Professor LANGLEY.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. NoAH PORTER and
Senator J. S. MoRRILL. The Secretary made a statement that the ab-
sence of Dr. ASA GRAY was caused by his severe illness.

The journal of the proceedings of the Board at the meetings on Janu-
ary 12 and November 18, 1887, was read and approved.

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the instructions of the
Board at the last meeting, he had again consulted with the widow of
the late Professor BAIRD, and ascertained that while she desired to
defer to the wishes of the Regents, her own preference would be that
the interment of the remains of her husband should be strictly private.
It was necessary therefore to depart from the arrangements which had
been contemplated at the last meeting of the Board, and by the advice
of the Executive Committee, a meeting of the Board of Regents was not
called as had been anticipated in December, and the stated annual
meeting is therefore now held at the regular time, as provided by the
regulations of the Board of Regents.

The Chancellor announced the appointment by the President of the
Senate, on December 19, 1887, of Hon. Randall L. Gibson, of Louisiana,
as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, vice Senator Maxey, whose
term had expired.

The Chancellor also announced the appointment by the Speaker of
the House of Representatives, on January 5, 1888, of Hon. S. S. Cox,
of New York, as regent, vice Hon. O. R. Singleton, who had not been
re-elected to Congress; and on the 10th of January, of Hon. Joseph
Wheeler, of Alabama, vice Hon. W. L. Wilson, and the re-appointment
of Hon. W. W. Phelps, of New Jersey.

Dr. Welling, chairman of the Executive Committee, presented its an-
nual report for the year ending June 30, 1887.
Dr. Welling, in presenting the report, called attention to # paragraph
on the third page, relative to the appropriation for ‘ethnological re-
XI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

searches,” and he wished it understood—not as a matter of criticism, but
in explanation—that the Executive Committee made no examination
or inspection of the accounts of the Bureau of Ethnology. These were
exclusively under the control—according to the acts of Congress mak-
ing the appropriations—“ of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion.” In this respect a difference existed between the duty of the com-
mittee in regard to these accounts and those of the Museum or of other
trusts committed to the Institution, of which careful examination was
made of every voucher.

The Secretary stated that he would be very willing to be relieved of
this weighty responsibility and would be gratified if it could be assumed
by the Regents. He had no desire to assume a personal responsibility
in regard to the appropriation referred to, and he hoped that in the
future it might be found possible to make the appropriations to the
“ Smithsonian Institution” instead of to the ‘ Secretary.”

Dr. Welling remarked that the Executive Committee does not care to
share this responsibility.

Dr. Coppée said he thought it the duty of the Regents to share in
this; and that if the language of the act was doubtful, and if in relation
to one trust it was the duty of the Secretary to confer with the Execu-
tive Committee, he thought that in others, although the Regents or the
Institution were not specially mentioned, he ought to come under the
Same arrangement.

General Meigs said that Congress made the distinction referred to by
Dr. Welling, and it was not for the Board to advise or dictate to Con-
gress,

[This view was assented to by various members of the Board.]

The Secretary having stated that the accounts of the Museum were
settled by the Interior Department, and that the estimates for preserva-
tion, ete., of the collections were sent by him through the Secretary of
the Interior to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chancellor remarked
that he thought that all the accounts of the Institution in regard to
any operations committed to it, should be settled directly with the
Treasury Department, and not through an intermediate department.

The Secretary said that the Chancellor had anticipated what he was
about to say. As the Executive Committee had observed, the relations
of the Museum with the Department of the Interior on the one hand
and with the Regents on the other, are undoubtedly ambiguous, since
the late Secretary of the Interior himself wrote to say that he did not
understand them. At present the Secretary of the Institution transmits
the estimates for the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, but does not transmit those of the Museum, which are sent through
the Secretary of the Interior. It would seem desirable that some ar- -
rangement should be made by which.in the future all the estimates
should be submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, and all appro-
priations for the Museum, as well as for the Bureau of Ethnology, made
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIII

to the Smithsonian Institution, and that the sundry eivil bill should be
changed in the items relating to the Museum and the Bureau of Eth-
nology.

The Chancellor expressed the opinion that all the appropriations
ought to be disbursed and controlled by the Institution.

After remarks by several of the Regents, on motion of Dr. Welling,
the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Regents recommend to Congress that the form of
the sundry civil appropriation bill be so changed in the items relating
to the Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology as to provide,

First, That these moneys shall be disbursed under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution.

Second, That the estimates for the appropriations of the Museum in
future shall be sent direct to the Secretary of the Treasury by the
Smithsonian Institution through its Secretary.

On motion, it was resolved that the report of the Executive Committee
be accepted.

The Secretary presented the annual report for the year ending June
40, 1887, which had been printed; but he regretted to say that he had
not been able to procure copies from the Public Printer in December, iu
accordance with the resolutions of the Board.

The Chancellor suggested that some action ought to be taken by Con-
gress to avoid delay in printing the annuai reports of the Institution.
He thought provision might be made by law for the printing of the
Smithsonian Institution outside of the Government Printing Office, as is
done in the case of the printing for the Supreme Court. The attention
of the Congressional Regents was especially called to this subject.

The Secretary stated that a large amount of indispensable printing
was now done through the Department of the Interior, and some pro-
vision ought to be made for this if the connection of the Museum with
the Department should cease. He hoped that the Congressional Re-
gents would take some action in this matter.

On motion of Mr. Cox, it was resolved that the report of the Secre-
tary for the year ending June 30, 1887, be accepted, and that the See-
retary transmit the same to Congress.

The Chancellor announced that on December 2, 1887, in accordance
with the statute, he had appointed Mr. G. Brown Goode to act as Act-
ing Secretary in case of the absence or disability of the Secretary.

The Secretary called the attention of the Board to a bill introduced in
the Senate by Senator Edmunds on the 12th of December, as follows :

A BILL to provide for paying the widow of the late Spencer F. Baird for the services
rendered by him as Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the ‘Lreas-
ury De, and he is hereby, directed to pay Mrs. Mary ©. Baird, widow of
the late Spencer I’. Baird, the sum of fifty thousand dollars, out of any
money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, in full compensation
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

for the services and expenses of the said Spencer F. Baird during his
administration of the office of Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, from
February twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and seventy-one, to the time
of his death in August, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven.

The Secretary also called attention to the fact that Senator Morrill
bad introduced a bill in the Senate on the 12th of December, 1887, as
follows:

A BILL for the erection of a bronze statue of Spencer F. Baird, late Secretary of the
Smithsonian Jnstitution.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution be, and are hereby, authorized to contract for a statue
in bronze of Spencer F. Baird, late Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, to be erected upon the grounds in front of the National Museum ;
and for this purpose, and for the entire expense of the foundation and
pedestal of the monument, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, or so
much of said sum as may be needed, is hereby appropriated, out of any
moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.

On motion of Mr. Phelps it was resolved that the Executive Commit-
tee and the Secretary be authorized to act for the Board of Regents
in case of the passage of any act of Congress relative to the erection of
a statue of Professor Baird.

The Secretary stated that he had but one more matter to which to
call the attention of the Board; it was brief, but of considerable im-
portance.

It may be remembered that several years ago the Secretary of the In-
stitution, Professor Baird, called the attention of the Regents to a bill
utroduced in the House of Representatives as follows, viz:

“For the erection of a fire-proof building on the south portion of the Smithsonian
Reservation for the accommodation of the U. 8. Geological Survey, and for other
purposes.

“« Beit enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the sum of two hundred
thousand dollars be, and hereby is, appropriated out of any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the erection of a fire-proof
building on the south portion of the Smithsonian Reservation for the
accommodation of the U.S. Geological Survey, and for other purposes:
Provided, That the consent of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
be first obtained thereto, and that the building be under their direction
when completed: And provided further, That the building be erected by
the Architect of the Capitol in accordance with plans approved by the
Director of the United States Geological Survey, the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, and the Architect of the Capitol, acting as a
board therefor.

‘“Atter a very full expression by the Regents in favor of immediate
action, on motion of General Sherman, it was

‘‘Kesolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
recommend to Congress to enlarge the National Museum, so as properly
to exhibit the mineral, geological, and other collections already on
hand and increasing each year, by the erection of a fire-proof building

on the southwest corner of the Smithsonian Reservation, similar in
style to the present National Museum, and they request an appropriation
of $300,000 therefor, to be expended under the direction of the Regents
of the Institution.” *

The Secretary remarked that the placing of the offices of the Geologi-
eal Survey upon land heretofore reserved exclusively for Smithsonian
purposes might be perhaps considered as committing the Institution
toward the policy of a union with other scientific bureaus of the Gov-
ernment. It was in view of the questions of general policy thus involved,
that it seemed proper that he should ask instruction from the Regents.
He could only infer their opinion on the former bill from the language
of the resolution, which apparently implied,

First. That increased provision was desirable for the Museum col-
lections.

Second. From its silence as to the Geological Survey, that the building
proposed in the bill was not to be appropriated to that use.

The Secretary had lately been informally advised that it was the desire
of the Geological Survey to obtain his opinion with reference to this, in
anticipation of a bill to be brought before the present Congress, and he
desired to be favored with the jadgment of the Regents.

The Chancellor stated that it was desirable that new Museum build-
ings should be erected in any case, but that since by act of Congress
a certain part of the public grounds had been set apart and appropri-
ated absolutely and exclusively to the Smithsonian Institution, he for
one did not want to see anything else placed on these grounds. He
further said: ‘If the Smithsonian Institution is to grow it will need
them all, and whatever is put upon them should be under our exelu-
sive eral 4

After remarks by a number of Regents, ¢ expressing concurrence in
the views of the Chancellor, it was suggested by Mr. Phelps that the
unabpimous opinion of the Board ought to be embodied in a resolution.

The Chancellor did not think this was necessary. He supposed all
the Secretary wanted was the moral support of the Board in a policy
which would forbid the placing of any building on the Smithsonian
grounds except for the exclusive use of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Secretary alluded to another bill, which proposed to occupy part
of the public grounds, including the Smithsonian reservation, with
buildings for the Columbian celebration in 1892. ~ It was here remarked
by a Regent that there was no danger of this being done immediately,
to which the Chancellor said, ‘‘ With my consent, never.”

On motion of Dr. Angell, it was resolved that the income of the Insti-
tution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1888, and ending June 30,
1889, be appropriated for the service of ae Institution, to be expended
by the Secretary, with the advice of the Executive Committee, ys the

basis of the operations described in the last annual report of said com-
mittee, with full discretion on the part of the Secretary as to items of
expenditures properly falling under each of the heads embraced in the
established conduct of the Institution.

The Chancellor informed the Board that he had the melancholy duty
to perform of announcing the death, yesterday, of Dr. PETER PARKER,
who bad been for many years a Regent of the Institution and chairman
of its Executive Committee.

On motion of Dr. Angell, it was resolved that the Executive Commit-
tee prepare resolutions relative to the death of Dr. Parker.

Dr. Welling, of the Executive Committee, presented the following
resolutions, which were adopted :

Whereas the Board has received the afflictive intelligence that the
venerable Dr. PETER PARKER, who, for sixteen years, was a member of
the Board of Regents, and who for this whole period served with fidelity
on its Executive Committee, has departed this life after a long career
filled with useful labors in the service of God and of man: Therefore,
be it

Resolved, That in the retrospect of such a life-career, protracted as it
was beyond the limits usually allotted to men, and yet at each stage of
its progress dedicated to beneficent works in the cause of religion,
philanthropy, and science, we desire to testify our respect for the exalted
worth and scrupulous conscientiousness which Dr. Parker brought to
the discharge of every duty, and which, during his connection with the
government of this Institution, were nobly exemplified by the zeal and
diligence with which he ever watched and worked for its prosperity
aud usefulness, even during the later period of his honorable service,
when the burden of years was added to the burden of his official cares,
and when with a less conscientious sense of public duty he might
have claimed an exemption from the tasks of life.

Resolved, That since the retirement of our departed colleague from the
membership of this Board we have continued to follow him with the
grateful recollections inspired by the association of this council cham-
ber, as well as with a reverent respect for the Christian patience with
which he bore the intirmities of advancing age and the unfaltering
Christian hope with which he awaited “the inevitable hour” in fuil
assurance of immortality.

Kesolved, That these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of the
Board, and that the Secretary of the Institution is hereby requested to
transmit a copy of them to the family of our late colleague.

On motion, the Board then adjourned sine die.
SPECIAL MEETING OF THE REGENTS.

WASHINGTON, March 27, 1888.

A special meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day at 11
o’clock A. M.

Present, Hon. J. J. INGALLS (President of the United States Senate
pro tem.); Hon. SAMUEL F. MILLER (acting Chief Justice of the United
States); Hon. J.S. MorritL, Hon. 8S. M. CuLLom, Hon. 8. S. Cox,
Hon. JOSEPH WHEELER, Hon. WILLIAM W. PHELPS, Dr. JAMES C.
WELLING, General M. C. MEIGS, and the Secretary, Prof. 8S. P. LANG-
LEY.

The Secretary called the Board to order.

On motion of Senator Morrill, Hon. J. J. Ingalls was elected Chair-
man.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. PORTER, Dr. COPPEE,
Dr. ANGELL, and Dr. WHITE.

The Secretary stated that this special meeting had been called at the
request of three of the Regents as provided in the organic act. There
were two subjects requiring consideration: First, the recent death of
the Chancellor of the Institution, Chief Justice Waite; second, the elec-
tion of a Chancellor.

Professor Langley remarked that it would be for others who had
known the late Chancellor longer than he had to speak of his worth and
public services. He could only say that Judge Waite was not only a
tower of strength to the Institution; he was much more; he had the
regard, the respect, and the reverence of all those who were brought into
relation with him. He could only speak of him with the real affection
he felt, and say that the loss the Institution had experienced was to
him that of a dear and revered personal friend.

On the second point, the Secretary stated that the joint signatures of
the Chancellor and Secretary were required on requisitions for money
from the United States Treasury for carrying on the operations of the
Institution, and that on the Ist of next July the semi-annual interest
would be due, and some one who could act as Chancellor, within the
provisions of the iaw, must sign the requisition in connection with the
Secretary, at that time. .

On motion of Dr. Welling, a committee was appointed to express the
sense of the Board in relation to the death of the Chancetlor.

The Chair appointed Dr. Welling, Senator Morrill, and Professor
Langley.

H. Mis, 142——11 XVII
XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

The committee retired and on its return reported through the chair-
man, Dr. Welling, the following preamble and resolutions, which were
unanimously adopted:

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has
been called to meet in extraordinary session by the afflicting intelli-
gence that Morrison REmMIcK WAITE, late Chief-Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, and late Chancellor of the Smith-
sonian Institution, has been removed by the hand of death from the
scene of iis high activities and distinguished usefulness; therefore be it

Resolved, That sitting as we do at this time and place, in the very
center of that dark shadow whici: has fallen upon the whole laud in the
lamented death of the late Chief-Justice Waite, and appalled as we
are by the suddenness as well as by the magnitude of the great aftlic-
tion which in coming to the nation at large has come to us individually,
with an added pathos of sorrow because of the nearer view we have
had, for so many years, of the talents, virtues, and graces which found
their familiar home in the person of our honored friend, we could with
inuch good reason crave for ourselves, in this hour of bereavement, the
humble permission of mourning apart, that we might silently gauge
the depth and the dimensions of a calamity which brings to us its
message of personal grief and which has also torn away from our high-
est seat of justice its venerated and beloved chief; from the legal pro-
fession of the country its foremost official representative and therefore
its crowning exponent; from the walks of social life in this national
capital a commanding presence no less remarkable for his genial and
open-bhearted sincerity than for his affable and gracious benignity; and
from the Christian communion a true and faithful disciple who wit-
nessed a good confession as much by the simplicity and humility with
which he walked before God as by the unswerving consistency with
which he wore the ornament of a pure heart and of a meek and quiet
spirit before the serutiny of his fellow-men.

Resolved, That while an obvious sense of propriety must dictate that
we should leave to others in that great forum which was the chosen
arena of his life’s career the sad privilege of depicting, with minute
and detailed analysis, the remarkable combination of strong and lovely
traits which met in the person of the late Chief-Justice and gave to the
symmetrical character of our beloved friend its blended sweetness and
light, we can not omit, even in this hour of our special sorrow, to bear
our cheerful testimony to the pleasing amenity with which he presided
over the deliberations of this council chamber as the Chancellor of the
Smithsonian Lustitution, and sharing, as we all do, in a profound ad-
miration for the intelligence he brought to our discussions, while ever
moderating them by the guidance of his clear thought and mild wisdom,
we can but render our reverent homage to the engaging personal qual-
ities which endeared him to us as a man, while at the same time grate-
fully confessing our obligations to him for the provident care and deep
interest which he always brought to the discharge of his official duties
in this place, where, through all the years of his honorable and useful
service at the head of this Board, the Secretary of the Institution in
common with ourselves has leaned on him as the wise and true coun-
sellor who could be trusted as well for the rectitude of his moral intui-
tions as for the clear perceptions of his calm and judicious intellect.

_ Kesolved, That we will attend the funeral of our departed Chancellor
in a body, and that the Secretary of the Institution, together with a
deputation from the members of the Board, be requested to accompany
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIX

the other friends and associates of the late Chief-Justice who will bear
his remains to their last resting place in Ohio.

Resolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the
Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send a copy of them to
the family of our departed friend in token of our sincere condolence
with them in their great affliction.

On motion of Senator Cullom it was resolved, that Acting Chief-
Justice SAMUEL F. MILLER be elected Chancellor pro tem.

On taking the chair, Justice Miller remarked that in this hour of
grief it was a consolation to be honored with the appointment which
had just been conferred upon him, especially as it was not a necessity
of law that he as Acting Chief-Justice should have been selected to fill
this important position. While it would not be expected of him on tie
present occasion to deliver a eulogy on the late Chancellor, it was only
proper for him to say that, sitting beside Judge Waite as he had done
for four hours a day for about fourteen years, he felt as well qualified
to appreciate his character as any man living. He was an able judge,
an upright man, honest in every fiber of his nature. No sophistry
could induce him to act in violation of his conscience. He never was led
to believe only what he desired to believe, or to decide against his con-
victions of right. He wasa sound jurist, and above all an able manager
of our complicated legal administrative affairs. We can not do too
much to honor his memory.

He thanked the gentlemen of the Board for the honor they had con-
ferred in electing him Chancellor.

On motion of Mr. Phelps, it was resolved, that all or any of the mem-
bers of the Board, and the Secretary, who wish to attend the funeral
services of the late Chancellor at Toledo, be appointed to represent the
Board of Regents.

On motion, the Board then adjourned sine die.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

August 10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added, by authority of
Congress, act of February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson,
and savings from annual income and other sources, $134,831. To this

NORTH AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

An appropriation of $40,000 was made by Congress for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1588, for the prosecution of ethnological researches
under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
The actual conduct of these investigations has been placed by the See-
retary in the hands of Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Geological
Survey. Theabstracts of expenditures and balance sheets for this appro-
priation have been exhibited tous; the vouchers for the expenditures,
after approval by theSecretary, are paid by the disbursing clerk of the
Bureau of Ethnology and transmitted to the accounting officers of the

Treasury Department for settlement.

The balance available to meet outstanding liabilities on the Ist of
July, 1888, as reported by the official disbursing agent, is $7,847.08.

REPORT OF SAMUEL P. LANGLEY,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 188782.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present with this the customary
report for the year ending June 30, 1888.

This year is memorable for the loss to the Institution, not only of its
Chancellor and of others to be mentioned later, but of its late Secretary,
Spencer F. Baird.

I have endeavored elsewhere to characterize his character and serv-
ices, while yet feeling that one who has been so recently called to fill
his place is hardly the fittest person to adequately describe them ; but
that may surely be repeated here which is no secret to any one, that
a most honored and useful life, which might have been prolonged for
many years, came to an end which can not but be called premature,
largely through a too self-sacrificing devotion to the public service.

I shall also have to speak later of the loss to the Institution of its
Chancellor, the late Chief-Justice of the United States—a man whom
those honored with his acquaintance grew, in proportion to their
knowledge of him, to look up to and trust; and of one of its Regents,
Prof. Asa Gray, pre-eminent in science, but in whom, as in the Chief-
Justice, the qualities of the intellect were supplemented by others, such
that both inspired even in their official relations, a feeling not only of
respect, but of affection, which the formal intercourse of public life
rarely brings.

The past has, indeed, been a fatal year to the Institution; but these
great losses have been spoken of at length in its necrology, and L will
now ask to be allowed to preface this and the rest of my report by a
few personal words.

Although long acquainted with both Professor Henry and Professor
Baird [ had no official relationship with either until two years ago, when
the latter, in view of the end which he must have felt to be approaching,
asked me if I was disposed to assume a connection with the Institution
while continuing the scientific researches to which my life had been
chiefly devoted.

The position then tendered me, and later at your hands, that of Sec-
retary, was accepted, from the knowledge that in your view such re-
searches for the increase of knowledge, no less than administrative la-

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

bors, formed the essential duties of the place to which I was honored
by your invitation, though it has happened that this, the first year of
these duties, has been passed all but exclusively in purely administra-
tive work, of which there is alone occasion at present to speak.

The year was begun with the feeling that it was best to closely follow
the methods of my predecessors till a longer experience should have
brought material for independent judgment; but at its close I desire to
be allowed to say that every experience has enhanced my confidence in
their policy as a permanent guide; and if it be true, as has sometimes been
said, that men eminent in science are apt to be devoid of capacity in the
management of daily affairs, we must conclude that Professor Henry
was a singular exception to such a rule; for the practical wisdom of the
general lines of conduct laid down by him, and adopted by my honored
predecessor, so commend themselves to me in the light of daily service
that more trust in them is felt with every new trial.

From them there may, it seems to me, be deduced some general con-
siderations with reference to the Seneemen Institution and its asso-
ciate interests, of which the following brief summary represents those
general principles of official action by which I have sought to be guided.

If the position of the Smithsonian is that of a ward of the Govern-
ment, having property of its own, for which that Government acts the
part of a trustee, while leaving its administration wholly with the Re-
gents, it follows that the Institution enjoys a measure of independence,
and in it a power of initiative for good which ought to be deemed its
most privileged possession; so that any action which is taken by one
having its interests at heart, ought to be with this consideration of its
independence always in mind.

The Institution is for “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.” It is not primarily for the promotion of utilitarian interests,
which can be advanced through other channels, but for knowledge
in the highest and widest sense, including not only all pure science,
but even, in the words of Henry, “the true, the beautiful, as well as the
immediately practical;” and these interests it is to guard from all en-

tangling alliances,

In dealing with the circumstances of to-day, the Institution should
still be guided by these principles; but in bringing them to the test of
present needs, we are daily reminded that these same principles are now
to be often applied to quite new conditions.

The Smithsonian has under its charge besides the Museum, the Bureau
of Ethnology, which will be referred to later, and some minor interests,
which are, however, insignificant in comparison.

It has from time to time been proposed by friends outside of this
Institution that it should take on much wider cares than these, and
that it should be the center around which all the scientific establish-
ments of the Government might cluster. In the writer’s opinion it
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

would not be pachiis impossible, but it would certainly be difficult, to
make such a permanent arrangement consistently with the audopendetns
of the Smithsonian, and its continued devotion to the original objects
of its being; but since the project is from time to time renewed, it may
not be superfluous to observe that in any case the Museum would stand
on an entirely different footing from any other governmental bureau of
applied science, if only because it has been created in a very consider-
able degree out of the endowment income of the Institution; while other
scientific bureaus have grown up wholly independent of the Smithso-
nian, which has neither legal nor moral title to their property.

It must be admitted, however, that the line of demarcation, even in
the Museum, between the property to which the Smithsonian has an
undoubted legal title; that to which this claim is only presumptive; and
that to which it has no claim, is not in all cases at present clearly drawn,
and we are endeavoring to remedy this uncertainty. As regards the
care of this property, a great gain has been made in the past year by
carrying out (with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior) the
wishes which the Regents expressed in regard to the Museum at their
last meeting; so that it is no longer uncertain how far this care falls
upon the Institution, and how far upon the Interior Department.

Reference has just been made to the question of the general policy to
be followed by the Smithsonian with regard to its accepting the charge
of other Government departments of science, and this question is so far
from being an idle one that the Secretary has been called upon during
the past year to consider whether it was his duty to advise that the Fish
Commission, which until lately had such intimate though unofficial re-
lations with the Institution, should be united with it by a legal bond,
or not. While feeling that it would be in many respects most desira-
ble to connect with the Smithsonian the purely scientific portions of the
Fish Commission and its apparatus of research, he could not but recog-
nize that these were almost indissolubly mingled with certain great
utilitarian interests, which were not equally proper subjects of the
Smithsonian’s care; and after cousultation with those Regents whose
advice he could separately obtain, he felt unable to urge such a union
with any confidence thai it would meet the approbation of the Board.

The President saw fit to appoint as Commissioner, Dr. G. Brown
Goode, the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who,
while still, with my full consent, retaining that place, accepted the
office provisionally, from a sense of duty to the interests of the Fish
Commission, concerning which he had obtained an intimate acquaint-
ance under the late Professor Baird.

Having placed these interests on a proper footing; after a brief period
of laborious but wholly gratuitous service, he declined the higher salary
and permanent appointment of Commissioner which was pressed upon
him, and resumed the duties here*to which his scientific life has been
chiefly devoted.
‘L REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

On the 2d of December, 1887, the chancellor, Chief-Justice Waite,
under the provision of the law, designated Dr. G. Brown Goode as
Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution during the absence of
the Secretary.

If only from the ordinary need of a periodical revision, nearly every
department of the Institution has been the subject of examination, and
in some cases of considerable modification during the past year, and I
now proceed to speak of these in some detail, prefacing each with a
brief statement of such considerations as seem to me deserving of the
particular attention of the Regents.

BOARD OF REGENTS.

Meetings of the Board.—A special meeting of the Board was held No-
vember 18, 1887, to take action in regard to the death of the Secretary,
Spencer Fullerton Baird, and at this meeting Samuel Pierpont Langley
was elected his successor.

The stated annual meeting of the Board was held on the 11th Jan-
uary, 1888.

A special meeting of the Board was also held on the 27th March, 1888,
to take action in regard to the death of the chancellor of the Institution,
Chief-Justice Waite.

The journal of proceedings of the Board is given in full, as usual, in
the introduction of the Regents’ report.

Changes in the Board of Regents.—Other vacancies than those already
mentioned have occurred in the membership of the Board during the
year by the expiration of the legal terms of service.

Senator Maxey’s term ended March 3, 1887, and with the close of
the Forty-ninth Congress the terms of the Hon. O. RK. Singleton, of the
Hon. W. L. Wilson, and of the Hon. W. W. Phelps, members of the
House of Representatives, also expired; and on the 19th of December,
1887, the President of the Senate appointed the Hon. Randall Lee Gib-
son, Senator from Louisiana, a Regent for the term of six years, to fill
the vacancy occasioned by Senator Maxey’s retirement. On the 5th of
January, 1888, the Speaker of the House of Representatives appointed
the Hon. Samuel 8. Cox, of New York, a Regent in the place of the
Hon. Otho RK. Singleton; and on the 10th of January, 1888, he appointed .
the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, of Alabama, a Regent in the place of the Hon.
William L. Wilson, and re-appointed the Hon. William Walter Phelps,
of New Jersey, to continue his service as Regent. Lastly, by joint rese
lution of Congress, approved by President Cleveland, February 15, 1888,
Dr. Andrew D. White, of New York, was elected a Regent for the term
of six years, to fill the place of Dr. Asa Gray, deceased.

At the special meeting of the Board of Regents, held March 27, 1888,
Mr. Justice Samuel I’. Miller, senior Associate and acting Chief Justice
of the United States Supreme Court, was elegted to act as chancellor of
the Institution pro tempore. So
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

FINANCES.

While with this is presented the report of the Executive Committee
and other statements, showing that the funds are in the usual sense in
a satisfactory condition, this seems to be a proper occasion to say some-
thing about the larger questions of finance, for, as time passes, the
purchasing power of money imperceptibly but surely alters, until finally
the consideration is forced upon us that these slow changes, though
alinost inappreciable from year to year, have, in the half century already
elapsed since Congress accepted Smithson’s bequest, essentially dimin-
ished the actual value of the fund, while its nominal value remains
unchanged.

I do not now refer merely to the fact that we measure all things by
another scale in 1888 from what we did in 1836; or that, owing to the
immense increase of public wealth, the capital of the original bequest,
which then was greater than any but a few private fortunes, has be-
come relatively so inconsiderable to-day. More than this is meant. It
is meant that the actual purchasing power of each dollar is, for our
purposes, notably less; that it is being forced upon us that we ean not
print as many books, or pay as many employés, or make as many re-
searches as when the scheme of expenditure was first fixed, and that,
consequently, a scheme which was wise then, because not only desirable
but feasible, is not necessarily so now.

I know that this consideration is not presented to the Regents for the
first time, and that ascommitiee of their number, as long ago as 1877,
observed—

“That the income of fhe Smithsonian fund, while nominally fixed, is
growing actually less year by year, with the rapidly-changing value of
money, and of less and less importance in, the work that it accomplishes
with reference to the immense extension of the country since the Gov-
ernment accepted the trust.”

In a time, short with reference to the probable life of the Institution,
the income of the Smithsonian fund proper will necessarily become en-
tirely inadequate to carry on the object of Henry’s care on the scale
which he inaugurated. Even when this is the case, it seems to me that
this income of the Smithsonian bequest will stiil have a value wholly
beyond its nominal one, for it will at least maintain the Institution in
that position of independence and disinterestedness which are its most
potent means of influencing others to aid in carrying out the intention
of its founder.

It is, nevertheless, most evidently desirable that the fand should be
enlarged both by Governmental recontribution and by private bequest,
so as to constantly represent at least the original position of its finances
relatively to those of the country and contemporary institutions of learn-
ing; a position which we can estimate from the observation that there
are several such institutions, which were at first scarcely on a par with it
financially, but whose funds, having been invested so as to share in the
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

growth of the country, and aided by private benefaction, now surpass
ours from ten to twenty fold.

We can never regret the generous spirit which has dictated the direc-
tion of the expenditure of the Smithsonian income in the past, but it is
true that if a less absolutely unselfish policy had been followed—if, for
instance, though keeping up all proper expenditures for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge, those funds whose expenditure bas practi-
eally inured chiefly to the benefit of the General Government had been
allowed to accumulate—the Institution would have been comparatively
wealthy to-day.

I will instance, in explanation of my meaning, the remark of Profes-
sor Henry in 1872, to the effect that the Government, in equity, should
then have paid the Institution $300,000 for the use of the present build-
ing. This building, erected wholly out of Smithsonian funds at the cost
of over half a million dollars, has, with the exception of a small por-
tion, been ever since that time used rent-free by the Government; and
if the observation had force then, it has double force to-day.

Again, the Institution has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in
the Museum alone, property acquired out of its private fund (and to
which it has apparently the same title), which is probably now more
than equal in value to the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest.

While it is gratefully recognized that Congress has never dealt in any
ungenerous spirit with the Institution, I can not think it superfluous to
keep such facts as those just cited in mind at a time when it becomes
necessary to review the whole scheme of expenditure, in view of an
income practically diminishing, and which would, if not for these facts,
be more than double its actual amount.

The will of James Smithson, of England, “to found at Washington,
under the naine of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” was made Octo-
ber 23, 1826.

The existence of the bequest was communicated to Congress by a
message from the President of the United States December 17, 1835,
and by an act of Congress approved July 1, 1836, the bequest was ac-
cepted, and the President was authorized and enabled to assert and
prosecute with effect the claim of the United States to the property
thereby bequeathed and then held in trust by the English court of
chancery.

Under this authority the sum of $508,318.46 was received in gold by
the United States and placed in the Treasury.

The “Smithsonian Institution” provided for in the will of Smithson
was not established, however, by Congress until August 10, 1846, when
a definite plan of organization was adopted and operations commenced.

By act of Congress February 8, 1867, the Secretary of the Treasury
was authorized to receive a residuary legacy of Smithson, which had
been received by the Institution in 1863, amounting to $26,210.63, on
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (

the same terms as the original bequest. By the same act the Regents
were authorized to add to the Smithsonian fund such other sum as they
might see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the
sum of $1,000,000.

The original bequest and the sums since added are therefore as follows:

States, bearing interest at 6 per cent. per annum..-.--....-.----- 703, 000. 00

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand of the income
from the fund was $1,423.14. The interest paid semi-annually July 1,
1887, and January 1, 1888, was $42,180.

To this was added from sales of publications and miscellaneous sources
$752.86, making a total available amount for carrying on the operations
of the Institution of $44,356; totalexpenditures for the year, $39,546.77;
leaving a balance July 1, 1888, of $4,809.23.

It is proper in this connection to state that the Institution is charged
by Congress with the care and disbursement of sundry appropriations,
those for the past year being as follows:

The vouchers for all the expenditures from these appropriations as
well as those from the Smithsonian income are carefully examined and
passed upon by the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents, with
one exception—those for ethnological researches.

The disbursement of this appropriation from its commencement has
been made under the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell, who has been in
charge of the Bureau of Ethnology.

The necessity of greatly increased appropriations for the proper con-
duct of the interests committed by Congress to the care of the Insti-
tution is daily more manifest, and has been made known in the strongest
terms to the National Legislature.

The estimates prepared to be submitted for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1889, are as follows: |

8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In accordance with the instructions of the Board of Regents at its
last annual meeting, I requested the Committee on Appropriations of
the House of Representatives to make certain changes in the assign-
ment of appropriations and the method of their disbursement.

The following is the correspondence on the subject with the Secretary
of the Interior and with the chairman of the Committee on Appropria-
tions.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
February 29, 1888.

Str: I have the honor to make the following requests in regard to
the assignment of the appropriations for the maintenance of the U. 8.
National Museum for the coming fiscal year:

(1) That the items for “ preservation of collections,” “heating and
lighting,” ‘furniture and fixtures” be transferred from their present
position in the schedule of “ Estimates of Appropriations, 188889 ” (p.
237), under the Department of the Interior, to a place under the gen-
eral head of “‘under the Smithsonian Institution,” and along with and
in proximity to the other items to be expended under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution or its Secretary.

(2) That each of these items be placed directly under the subhead
“Under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as
director of the National Museum.”

(3) That a special item be inserted under the caption “ Public print-
ing and binding,” providing the sum of $10,000 for printing labels and
blanks for the use of the National Museum and for the ‘ Bulletins” and
annual volumes of the “‘ Proceedings” of the Museum.

In explanation of these requests, I submit the following statements :

Theactof Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution, approved
August 10, 1846 (Revised Statutes, Tithe LX XII, sections 5579, 5594),
“provided that all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and
all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical
specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States, which
may be in the city of Washington, shall be delivered to the Regents of
the Smithsonian Institution, and, together with new specimens obtained
‘ by exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classified
as best to facilitate their examination and study.

The National Museum, as it is now called, was thus placed under the
sole control and direction of the Smithsonian Institution, and has ever
since remained under its control; Congress having, since 1858, made
annual appropriations for its maintenance. Until 1880, however, the
Sums thus appropriated were inadequate, and the yearly deficiences
were paid from the income of the Institution.

In accordance with a practice of nearly thirty years the estimates for
the annual appropriations have been each year, at the request of the
Secretary of this Institution, forwarded by the Secretary of the Interior
to the Secretary of the Treasury for transmission to Congress, and the
disbursement of tlie appropriation has been made by the disbursing
agent of the Interior Department.

This arrangement is Somewhat inconvenient aud cumbersome, and at
the last meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
the following resolution was adopted :

“* Resolved, That the Regents recommend to Congress that the form
of the sundry civil appropriation bill be so changed in the terms relating
to the Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology as to provide—
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

“6(1) That these moneys shall be disbursed under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution.

(2) That the estimates for the appropriations of the Museum in the
future shall be sent direct to the Secretary of the Treasury by the
Smithsonian Institution through its Seeretary.”

In obedience to the wishes of the Board of Regents thus expressed,
the matter was brought to the attention of the Secretary of the Inte-
rior, in arecent interview, by Chief-Justice Waite (the Chancellor of the
Smithsonian Institution) and myself. Asa result of this meeting a
letter has been received from the Secretary of the Interior, in which he
expresses the opinion that changes may be made with great propriety
both in the manner of voting the appropriation and in the method of
its disbursement. A copy of this letter is herewith inclosed, together
with a copy of a second letter received in response to an inquiry as to
the manner in which this change may best be effected.

In further explanation of the third request, I wish to say that this
does not involve anew appropriation, since the estimate for this amount
is included, as I understand it, in the sum of $375,525 estimated by the
Secretary of the Treasury for the printing of the Interior Department
and its Bureaus (see page 129 of the ‘“‘ Estimates of Appropriations,
1888—89”). I may say in further explanation of this item that an ap-
propriation has thus been made for the printing of the National Museum
for at least twelve years past, and I am informed that the amount al-
lotted during recent years has usually been $10,000,

I believe these changes will be in the interest of the public service,
and respectfully ask that they be made.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
Hon. SAMUEL J. RANDALL, -
Chairman of Committee on Appropriations,
House of Representatives.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Washington, February 14, 1888.

Sir: I have considered the topic of the conference which I had the
honor to have yesterday with the Chancellor of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and yourself, being the relation of the Interior Department to
the expenditure of the appropriation for the increase and care of the
National Museum, which is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, and
whetber there be objection to the recommendation of an independency
in the disbursement of the funds provided for its support as well as in
its management.

The first collection of scientific curiosities which appears to have been
a special object of care on the part of Congress was that made by the
Wilkes Exploring Expedition, provided for by the act of May 14, 1836
(5 Stats., 29). This collection was first placed in the care of the Na-
tional Institution for the Promotion of Science, and afterwards was
transferred to the hall in the second story of the Patent Office. In
1846, when the act for the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution
was passed, it was provided that, ‘as suitable arrangements could be
made for their reception, all objects of art, and of foreign and curious
research, and all objects of natural history, plants, geological and min-
eralogical specimens, belonging or hereafter to belong to the United
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesover custody
the same may be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be author-
ized by the Board of Regents to receive them, and shall be arranged in
such order and so classed as best to facilitate the examination and study
of them in the building so as aforesaid to be erected for the Institu-
tion;” provision having been made in the act for a suitable building,
etc. It was provided by Congress that the Smithsonian Institution
might be constructed adjacent to the Patent Office Building, but the
project was not accepted, and an independent building, where now
located, was arranged, this being completed in the year 1853.

It is said that the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of
Patents were desirous of removing the collections of the exploring ex-
pedition and of the National Institution out of the Patent Office Build-
ing, and requested the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to receive
them. This appears to have been acceded to by the Regents on the
condition imposed that the Secretary of the Interior should provide for
the payment of the expenses of the keeping and care of the collections.

An appropriation of $15,000 was made by Congress in the act of
March 3, 1857, for the construction of cases, and of $2,000 for the re-
moval of the articles. It was then held by the Attorney-General, in
response to a request of the Secretary of the Interior for his opinion,
that the provision in the eighth section of the act of the 4th ef August,
1854 (10 Stats., 572), placing the collections under the control of the
Commissioner of Patents, and authorizing the employment by bim of .:
keepers therefor, was designed to be temporary only, and that the act
establishing the Smithsonian Institution, as well as that making the
appropriation in 1857, were to be regarded as indicating the purpose of
Congress respecting permanent provision for these collections.

In 1858, by the act of the 2d of June (11 Stats., 301), an appropria-
tion of $4,000 “ for the preservation of the collection ot the exploring
and surveying expeditions of the Government” was made as a contin-
gent expense in the office of the Secretary of the Interior. This ap-
pears to have been the product of the condition acceded to by the Sec-
retary of the Interior upon the oceasion of the removal of the collections
from the Patent Office to the Smithsonian; and, pursuing the same
practice in October, 1858, Professor Henry, your illustrious predecessor,
requested of the Secretary of the Interior the renewal of the same ap-
propriation. Since that time this course appears to have been pursued
without any other reason for its support than this summary narration
indicates.

By the seventh section of the act for the establishment of the Smith-
sonian Institution (9 Stats., 105) the Secretary is directed to discharge
the duties of “ keeper of the Museum,” and authorized, with the con-
sent of the board, to employ assistants. No power of appointment of
any of the officers who expend the money provided by these annual ap-
propriations is supposed to exist, or, since the transfer to the Smith-
sonian, has ever been exercised by any officer of this Department.

The manner of the appropriation has operated to impose upon the
disbursing officer of this Department the duties of an auditor and a
treasurer for this fund, as an officer for whom the Secretary is respon-
sible. But no authvrity over the expenditures appears to rest with the
Secretary of the Interior or at least ever to have been exercised, so that
any Scrutiny supposable has been thatonly of an auditor. Practically the
disbursement of this appropriation has been made by the officers of the
Smithsonian Institution, subject to two audits, one by this Department
and the other by the Treasury, while the disbursing officer of the In-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

terior Department acts as the disbursing officer for the Smithsonian, and
a clerk has been assigned, as I am informed, by the Smithsonian to duty
in the Interior Department to assist the disbursing officer.

Obviously there is nothing in the relations between the Smithsonian
and the Interior Department to require the continuance of this state of
things. The National Museum enjoys now an anoual appropriation of
a large amount in the various items, not usually less than $150,000. In
the last act the appropriation was of $12,000 for heating, lighting, elec-
trical, and telephonic service; of $116,000 for the preservation, exhibi-
tion, and increase of the collections; and of $40,000 for cases, furniture,
fixtures, and appliances; both of the latter items embracing salaries.
These items indicate not only the considerable proportions which the
Museum has attained, but that their disbursement should be in the
hands of those who have the government ot the Museum and a direct
responsibility exacted.

So far, then, from there appearing to be objection, the facts suggest
to my mind the wisdom and desirability of providing for the National
Museum directly, and imposing responsibility fer the disbursement of
the appropriation immediately upon the officers of that Institution, and
with accountability to the Treasury, as in other cases.

The act of July 7, 1884 (23 Stats., 214), was a step in the direction
of this independency of requiring the director of the National Museum
to report annually to Congress the progress of the Museum during the
year and its present condition.

The papers you kindly loaned me are herewith returned.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
Wm. F. VILAS,
Secretary.
Prof. S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretaru of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Washington, February 20, 1888.

Siz: Replying to your favor of the 16th instant, I beg to say that it
seems to me that so long as Congress has made the appropriation for
the current year ‘under the Interior Department” in terms, it is neces-
sary that it should be expended according to the practice hitherto
prevailing; and that, if the same terms of appropriation should be
continued, it would be with the expectation that the fixed practice of
disbursement would continue also. It is therefore probably necessary
that the language of the appropriation should be changed in order to
effect the object desired. It may be presumed the accounting officers
of the Treasury would require it.

The same observations may be applied to the appropriation for print-
ing. I think it desirable that that should be separately made, so that
the Smithsonian Institution should be independent, in its use of the
provisions made by Congress, of this Department, and this Department
freed of care in respect to it.

Yours, respectfully,
Wm. F. VILAS,
Secretary.
Prof. 8. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It was anticipated that when the wishes of the Regents were communi-
cated to the Appropriations Committee of the House, the objection
might be raised that the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as
such, was not an officer of the Government in the sense that the head
of an executive department is, and that this might be an obstacle to
the proposed transfer.

Such objection was, in fact, made in the committee, and for this rea-
son the bill as reported from the House committee places the Museum
appropriation “under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as
director of the National Museum ;” while at the same time this, with the
other appropriations, is subordinated to the general title “under the
Smithsonian Institution.”

In regard to the Bureau of Ethnology, the Secretary had already
represented to the Regents his desire to see such a modification of the
wording as might relieve him from the personal responsibility imposed
by the language of former bills. The change actually introduced by
the committee consists in making the former words ‘under the di-
rection of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution” subordinate
to the same general title ‘‘ under the Smithsonian Institution.”

Should the bill as reported pass both houses the disbursements for
the National Museum will hereafter be made by an officer designated
by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, duly qualified and
bonded to the acceptance of the Secretary of the Treasury, whose of-
fice will be in the Smithsonian building, instead of by the disbursing
officer of the Department of the Interior, as heretofore.

The appropriations for “ international exchanges” will also be dis-
bursed by the same clerk at the Institution, instead of the disbursing
clerk of the Treasury Department.

This new arrangement, while adding greatly to the responsibilities
and cares of the officers of the Institution, will, it is believed, secure
good results.

International exchanges.—The regular estimate submitted to Congress
was as follows:

For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the
United States and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smith-
sonian Institution, including salaries or compensation of all necessary
employés, $15,000.

A revised estimate was submitted to Congress through the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, on May 31, 1888, asking for $27,050 for the ex-
changes.

The House committee declined to recommend the proposed increase.
It was then laid before the Senate Committee on Appropriations and
an argument presented in favor of the increase, which induced the com-
mittee to report an amendment to the sundry civil bill increasing the
appropriation from $15,000 to $20,000.*

* See Congressional Record, July 29, 1888, page 7666.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

This amendment was adopted by the Senate, rejected by the House,
and finally lost in conference committee of the two houses, so that the
increase of appropriation for exchanges is only $3,000 for the next fis-
cal year.

Preservation of collections——The appropriation asked for this service
was $150,000. The House committee reported $120,000; the Senate
committee, $125,000, and this latter amount was finally agreed to.

Furniture and fixtures.—An estimate of $40,000 was submitted, ac-
cepted by both committees, and passed by Congress.

Heating and lighting —The original estimate “ for expense of heating,
lighting, and electrical and telephonic service for the National Museum,”
was $12,000. This sum was reported by the House Committee on Ap-
propriations and adopted by Congress without change.

Armory building.—For several years this building has been occupied
jointly by the National Museum and the U. 8. Fish Commission, the lat-
ter paying the expenses of its care and repairs since July 1, 1885.

The House Committee on Appropriations in reporting the item of
$120,000, for “preservation of the collection of the National Museum”
inserted the following clause: *“‘ And for the care and custody of the so-
called Armory building,” thus transferring the whole of the building and
its maintenance to the Museum.

The Senate Committee on Appropriations, after hearing a statement
from the U.S. Fish Commissioner,* struck out this clause, and inserted
the following under the items for the Fish Commission :t

Provided, That the building known as the Armory building, Wash-
ington, District of Columbia, is hereby transferred to the charge of the
United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries for use as a hatching
and distributing station and for offices.

These diverse views were finally reconciled by the conference com-
mittees, who reported the following, which became a law: “+ Under the
U. S. Commission of Fish and Fitheries.”

Provided, That the building known as the Armory building, Wash-
ington, District of Columbia, shall be occupied as at present, jointly by
the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries and the National
Museum.

North American Ethnology.—The regular estimate for ‘ continuing
ethnological researches among the American Indians, under the diree-
tion of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, including salaries
or compensation of all necessary employés,” was $50,000.

The House Committee on Appropriations, however, only reported
$40,000, the sum which has been appropriated annually since 1884,
This sum was accepted by both the House and the Senate, and is the
amount appropriated. The appropriation is placed in the language of
former years ‘“‘ under the direction of the Secretary,” but at his request
this with other departments is placed under the general caption ‘under
the Smithsonian Institution.”

14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Report of the expenditures to be made to Congress —The House Com-
mittee on Appropriations proposed a clause in the sundry civil bill for
the next fiscal year which was agreed to by Congress and forms part of
the act (No. 307), which is as follows:

That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution shall submit to
Congress at its next session a detailed statement of the expenditures of
the fiscal year 1883, underappropriations for “ International Exchanges,”
‘North American Ethnology,” and the “ National Museum,” and annu-
ally thereafter a detailed statement of expenditures under said appro-
priations shall be submitted to Congress at the beginning of each reg-

Among other matters discussed at the last meeting of the Regents
was the erection of a new Museum building. On this occasion the Re-
gents tacitly re-affirmed their resolution of 1582, recommending to Con-
gress the enlargement of the National Museum by the erection of a fire-
proof building on the southwest corner of the Smithsonian reservation,
similar in style to the present National Museum; but on viewing the
sketch plans, which had been prepared subsequently to the resolution,
so as to include offices for the Geological Survey, they added an ex-
pression of their opinion that the new building should be planned ex-
clusively for Museum purposes.

It was not at first intended to take action in this matter during the
present year, but the overcrowded condition of the building, on account
of which not only the current werk but the proper development of the
collections is greatly impeded, seemed to render immediate action nec-
essary. A still more urgent need appeared to be the unsatisfactory
sanitary condition of the new Museum building. A committee, consist-
ing of Dr. J. H. Kidder, chairman, Dr. James M. Flint, U.S. Navy, and
Mr. J. K. Watkins, was appointed on April 14 to make a careful study
of the water supply, ventilation, and drainage, and in May submitted
a preliminary report, from which it appeared that an alarming amount
of sickness and mortality has been manifest among the employés since
1881—a mortality which ean not be attributed to the location of the
building, which has sometimes been pronounced unsanitary, since there
has been ne corresponding percentage of ill health in the old Smithson-
ian building adjoining. The number of days lost by employés on ac-
count of sickness in 1836 was 796; in 1887,875; and in 1888, up to May
10, 215, by far the largest part of this loss of time being attributed on
the books of the Museum to miasmatie diseases. The committee states
that there is no reasonable doubt that some, if not all, of the ten deaths
since 1881 were hastened or induced by the unwholesome condition of
this building. The committee suggested repairs and modifications of
considerable extent, including the construction of continuous cellars
under each of the four sides of the building, which, in addition to the
other necessary expenses, would cost in the neighborhood of $40,000,
REPORY OF THE SECRETARY. 15

This state of affairs seemed to demand decided action, and it being
absolutely impossible to make any changes in the present building with-
out entirely vacating a portion of it for a considerable period of time,
the exigency for more accommodation seemed a great deal more urgent
than had been at first supposed.

While it became evident, ou study ot the question, that for the ulti-
mate needs of the Museum, a building of but one story occupying the
same area as the present Museum would be insufficient, the question
of immediate action was unexpectedly brought up in May by one of the
senior Regents, a member of the Senate, who, when visiting the Museum
with some friends, noticed its crowded and unsatisfactory condition.
Having learned from me of the mortality and sickness of the employés,
he inquired as to the feasibility of erecting a new building, and offered
to use his influence to procure an appropriation, if 1 could obtain for
him a set of sketch plans-within a week, time being, as he stated, a very
essential condition. After consulting with the chairman of your Exec-
utive Committee, I had no hesitation in accepting such an offer, but a
difficulty arose from the fact that the sketch plans which had been laid
before the Regents in 1882 were in part for purposes which the Regents
had at their last meeting disapproved, and that hence they could not
be used. By great diligence, however, plans for a building to be de-
voted exclusively to Museum purposes were prepared within the time
mentioned. These were based upon an extensive accumulation of
notes and drawings, embodying the record of the best recent work of
museum construction in this country and in Europe, and they were for
a building, as far as was consistent with these improvements, like the
existing Museum. The report submitted by Senator Morrill, to accom-
pany Senate bill 3134, contains the correspondence on which action
_was taken, and I have discussed the acts therein presented elsewhere
under the proper heads.*

The following bill was introduced by Senator Morrill on June 12, was
passed by the Senate on June 20, and at the end of the fiscal year was
in the hands of the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds:

A BILL for the erection of an additional fire-proof building for the use of the National
Museum.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the sum of five hundred
thousand dollars is hereby appropri iated, out of any money in the Treas-
ury not otherwise appropriated, or so much thereof as may be neces
sary, for the erection of a fire- proof building for the use of the } National
Museum, to cover three hundred feet square, and to consist of two
stories and basement, to be erected under the direction of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution, i in accordance with the plans now on file
with the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, on the south-
western portion of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution. Said
building to be placed west of the Smithsonian Tustitution, leaving a

roadway between it and the latter of not less than forty feet, with the
north front on a tine with the south face of the building of the A gricult-
ural Department and of the Smithsonian Institution; and all expendi-
tures for the purpose herein mentioned shall be audited by the proper
officers of the Treasury Department.

The building, as proposed, covers the same area as the present
Museum, and is of the same general style, so far as is consistent with
the introduction of a second story, thus affording nearly three times as
much accommodation under the same area of roof as the building now
in use. The arrangement of the interior of the proposed new structure
is, however, considerably modified, as the result of the experience of
seven years’ occupation of the present building. The eighteen exhi-
bition halls on the two main floors are completely isolated from each
other, and are capable of subdivision into smaller hails. The lighting
will be equally as good as in the present building, the ventilation will
be much better, and in other important respects the sanitary arrange-
ments will be far more satisfactory.

A basement story is absolutely necessary, not only with a view to
promoting the comfort and health of visitors and employés, as well as
for securing greater dryness and better preservation of the specimens,
but also for the purpose of providing large apartments for store-rooms
and workshops. These proposed improvements in arrangement will
not, however, interfere with the possibility of constructing a building
which shalt conform in the essential points of exterior proportion with
the main features of the present building.

The present building contains about 80,000 square feet of floor space
available for exhibition and storage. The building proposed will con-
tain about 220,000 square feet. The amount of room for offices and
laboratories would be about the same in each. The net areain the new
building available for exhibition, storage, and office rooms, as esti-
mated, would be between 5 and 6 acres.

For the construction of the present Museum Building an appropria-
tion of $250,000 was made. This sum was supplemented by the follow-
ing special appropriations: $25,000 for steam-heating apparatus,
$26,000 for marble floors, $12,500 for water and gas fixtures and elec-
trical apparatus, and $1,900 for special sewer connections. The total
amount expended on this building was therefore $315,400, and it is
generally admitted that the cost of its construction was considerably
less than that of any other similar building in existence; in fact, per-
haps too cheap to secure the truest economy.

The proposed structure can be erected at a proportionately smaller
cost. I have obtained from responsible bidders, who are willing to give
bonds for the completion of the work in accordance with the bids which
they have submitted, estimates for the erection of the building com-
plete, with steam-heating apparatus and all other essential appliances,
excepting the electrical equipment, amounting in the aggregate to
$473,000, These bids, upon which the estimates of cost have been made,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

were not competitive, aud it is possible that something may be saved
through competition. It is, however, necessary to provide also for the
architect’s superinten dence, and for the removal and reconstruction of
the Smithsonian stable, which now occupies the site. I therefore think
it advisable to make request for the sum of $500,000, in order that these
additional items and other contingencies may be covered.

The plans, though drawn in the limited time imposed, represent the
results of an exhaustive study—which has extended over several years—
of plans of the best modern museum buildings in Europe and America,
nearly all of which have been personally inspected by officers of the
Smithsonian Institution.

It will be remembered by the Regents that neither the central por-
tion of the Smithsonian Building nor the so-called “ chapel,” at its west-
ern extremity, has ever been made fire-proof. The first contains valua-
ble collections, which are in somewhat menacing neighborhood to the
paint shop outside and to alcoholic stores within. These ought to be
provided for separately, but the representations made of the necessity
have not yet obtained attention from Congress. A special occasion
having arisen which made it desirable, at any rate, to complete the tire-
proofing of the ‘‘ chapel,” on the 21st May, at the request of the Sec-
retary, Hon. J. S. Morrill reported from the Committee on Public
Buildings the following bill:

A BILL to provide for making the west end of the Smithsonian Building fire-proof,
and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That for the purpose of making
the roof of the Gothic chapel at the west end of the Smithsonian Build-
ing fire-proof, and for other purposes, under the direction of the Re-
gents of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of seventeen thousand
five hundred dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby
appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appro-
priated.

This bill was adopted without a dissenting vote by the United States —
Senate.

It was referred in the House May 22, 1888, to the Committee on
Public Buildings, but no report was made by the committee. The same
bill was offered in the Senate on the 28th of June by Senator Morrill as
an amendment reported by the Senate Committee on Public Buildings
and Grounds to the sundry civil bill. This was referred to the Senate
Committee on Appropriations, but was not reported back.

Fire-proofing west range of Smithsonian building.—In 1887 Congress
made an appropriation of $15,000 “for urgent and necessary repairs to
central and western portions of the Smithsonian Institution.”*

This was expended in removing the combustible material in the west
range, as this was the most urgent work required. The contents of

this part of the building, consisting of the alcoholic collections, were
very inflammable and dangerous. The fire-proofing was intrusted to
Messrs. Cluss and Schulze, architects, from whose report the following
account of the work is taken:

“The reconstruction extended over the curtain between the main
building and the west wing, a building of 60 feet in length and 54 feet
in width, with an adjoining turret containing stairs. It contains a
basement where alcoholic specimens are kept.

‘The main story is mostly occupied by an exhibition hall, extending
up into the roof, with a clere-story. Along the north front was origi-
nally an open cloister, which had been, for many years, temporarily fitted
up, by frame-work, for offices. .

‘ Permanent provision was made for these purposes, and a mezzanine
story formed by the insertion of a fire proof upper floor.

‘‘ Besides the old, rotten, combustible floors and roofs, a complicated
system of decorative hollow columns and vaults, framed of wooden
scantlings, boards, and lathed plastering, had to be carefully removed,
so as not to injure the outside walls, consisting of a thin cut-stone fac-
ing, backed by ordinary rubble-work.

“In the reconstruction the Romanesque general character of the
building was preserved with the greatest simplicity compatible with
the surroundings, and also made a necessity by the limited appropria-
tion, in conjunction with the increased cost of decorations in fire-proof
materials.

“The first advertisement for bids for the work was confined to what
was required for making the reconstructed building ready for ocecu-
pancy; and to leave desirable but not absolutely necessary improve-
ments and internal finishings to any balance left from the appropria-
tion.

‘* Under date of June 27, 1887, an advertisement was issued for the
wrought and cast iron work, and the award made to C. A. Schneider’s
Sons, of this city, at $1,848, the lowest bid received.

‘“‘On July 6, 1887, another advertisement was issued for cut-stone
work, brick-work, fire-proofing, metal-roofing, lighter iron-work, corru-
gated-iron lathing, carpenter’s work, plastering, and miscellaneous work.
There was no bid below that of D. T. Cissel, of Washington, which
amounted to $9,850, and was within the estimates.

** Miscellaneous minor operations, such as cleaning and clearing the
building, steam fitting, and electric work, were done by day’s work and
settled for on pay-rolls.

‘‘The hardware was obtained in open market, by competition among
the principal dealers of the city, on specifications.

‘“The contractors have satisfactorily and for the sums agreed upon
completed their work.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

The east room, used for the meeting of the Regents, has had such
improvements made in its ventilation as the defective construction of
the building in this respect admitted, and I have taken occasion to draw
on the different departments of the Smithsonian for its furniture, so
that this may recall in some measure the various interests under the
Regents’ care.

RESEARCHES.

From the foundation of the Institution the promotion of original re-
search has been regarded as one of its important functions under the
general provision of Smithson’s bequest, and by encouraging and facili-
tating the discovery of new truths it is obvious that the primary pur-
pose of the founder—the increase of knowledge—can be most efficiently
attained.

Natural science falls into two great divisions, the biological and the
physical, and since it has been the case that of late years the first of
these has been almost exclusively encouraged by the Smithsonian, it
was the desire of the late Secretary, Professor Baird, to do something
to restore the balance, and with this end in view he had made prepara-
tions to secure an astro-physical observatory and laboratory, and though
these preparations were interrupted by his death it is understood that
through his action some friends of the Institution have already offered
to give the means for the erection of the modest structure needed for
the accommodation of such a special observatory. The site would nec-
essarily be suburban, on account of the especial need of seclusion and
the absence of tremor in the soil, such as is felt in the neighborhood of
the streets of a city.

No steps have yet been taken to secure a site, but in view of the
promise of meaus for the building, and the fact that the construction of
the necessary apparatus will occupy a leng time, I have ordered such
of the essential pieces as are not likely to be ready, even under these
conditions, till the building is prepared to receive it. With the excep-
tion of this preparation there has been nothing done for the increase
of knowledge in the physical branches of science in the-past year, but
it may be remarked that the Institution is in possession of a certain
amount of philosophical apparatus. This is formed of the débris of its
first collection (nearly destroyed by the fire) and of a certain few pieces
purchased by Professor Henry in the later years of his life.

There are also a number of historical relics, as the philosophical
instruments used by Dr. Joseph Priestly and others. These were on
exhibition in the new Museum Building, but the room they occupied
being wanted for other purposes the collection was transferred to the
Smithsonian Building where they were placed in an apartment adjoining
the laboratory. Arrangements are now being made for a more suit-
able depository and for the exhibition to the publie of such articles of
this class as may be of general interest.

The Institution has continued to give an important impulse to the
20 RERORT OF THE SECRETARY.

prosecution of the biological sciences, but most largely so, indirectly
through the Museum and Bureau of Ethnology.

The chief research has been under an arrangement made by the
late Secretary. Prof. E. D. Cope has been engaged during the en-
tire year in completing and preparing for publication the results of
an investigation upon the reptiles and batrachians of North Ameriea,
which has been in progress under the direction of the Institution for
more than twenty years. The first part, consisting of a Monograph on
the Batrachians, has been handed in and sent to the Public Printer, and
the work of printing it as one of the bulletins of the National Museum
has been already begun.

The expense entailed in the publication has been much greater than
the late Secretary anticipated, but I have felt it proper to continue it,
not only to carry out a purpose which had engaged the interest of Pro-
fessor Baird, but on account of the great intrinsic importance and value
of the work itself. No complete memoir on the Batrachians of North
America has ever been published; while the projected work enters
fully into questions of anatomy and geographical distribution, in addi-
tion to the customary discussion of classification and synonymy, and
will supply a long-felt need of biologists not alone in America but
throughout the world.

The second part, relating to the Reptiles, is in progress, and its com-
pletion is promised during the coming year.

Important investigations are in progress at the hands of the curators
and their assistants in every department of the Museum, for which ref-
erence may be made to that portion of my report.

EXPLORATIONS.

Our function in promoting the increase of knowledge has always been
regarded as including in its scope and object explorations at distant or
less familiar localities. Though no special explorations independent of
those already undertaken in connection with the Fish Commission have
been made during the past year, I am in hearty accord with the policy
of giving such encouragement to the lines of investigation heretofore
prosecuted in this respect as may be practicable from the portion of
our income which can be thus appropriated.

The activity in exploration this year is not less than heretofore, but
it has chiefly been carried on by the appropriation for ethnological re-
searches. This has been placed by law under your Secretary, who has
continued the arrangement, in some sense inherited from his predeces-
sors, under which the direction of the expenditure has been left almost
wholly within the discretion of Maj. J. W. Powell, from the confidence
felt equally in his scientific acquirements as an ethnologist and his
known capacity as an administrator. The usual report of the Bureau
of Ethnology is given elsewhere.

There has also been a limited amount of exploration carried on in con-
nection with the Museum.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

Mr. Romyn Hitchcock, one of the curators of the Museum, has been
for two years ou leave of absence, while performing the duty of profes-
sor of English at the University Osaka, Japan, and has been assisted
as far as has been practicable in his explorations in the west and north
of the Japanese Archipelago.

Two of the geological curators have explored numerous mineral locali-
ties in connection with the work of completing the sets of minerals for
distribution. Their work is referred to in the report of the Museum.

Two employés of the Museum accompanied the Fish Commission
schooner Grampus on her trip to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, for the pur-
pose of taking advantage of the opportunity, should any offer, of
exploring the natural history of the islands of that region, and par-
ticularly to make search for the remains of the Great Auk. They
were successful in their efforts, obtaining important collections and
material for a report which will be presented in connection with the
work of the Museum.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. Charles H. Townsend, of the
U.S. Fish Commission, was engaged in the joint service of the Commis-
sion and the Museum in natural history exploration in Central Amer-
ica. He returned in October, 1887.

Ensign A. P. Niblack, U. 8S. Navy, (for three years attached to the
scientific staff of the Museum,) during a cruise upon the coast of Alaska
made extensive collections and obtained material for a report on the
ethnology of that region.

PUBLICATIONS.

Classes of publications.—Of the Smithsonian publications, the first
class—both in priority of introduction and in scientific importance—is
the quarto series of Contributions to Knowledge. This series, numbering
twenty-five volumes, was inaugurated forty years ago.

An early hope had been entertained that the Institution might be
enabled to issue one volume of the quarto series each year, but it was
soon discovered that original memoirs of merit, embodying new acquisi-
tions to our knowledge, could not be procured at any such rate. Partly
by reason of the rapid growth of scientific institutions in our country,
and partly by reason of the largely increased endowments of some of
them, other channels of scientific publication have been opened, and
there has been a steady reduction both in the number of memoirs pre-
sented to this Institution for publication and in the numbers of these
judged deserving of a place in the ranks of the “‘ Contributions.” This
diminution of fertility is perhaps best exhibited by the following table
of volumes issued during each successive period of ten years:

During first decade (from 1848 to 1857), nine volumes.

During second decade (ending 1867), six volumes.

During third decade (ending 1877), six volumes,

During fourth decade (ending 1887), four volumes.
22 REPORT OF TRE SECRETARY.

It may be stated that the last volume of this series (Volume XXvV) was
issued in 1885, and that one memoir of 196 pages, with five chromo-
lithographic plates, ‘‘ Researches upon the Venoms of Poisonous Ser-
pents” (by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell and Dr. Edward T. Reichert) has since
been published (1886) as an installment for Volume XxxvI.

The second class of Smithsonian publications is the octavo series of
Miscellaneous Collections, which was not organized until nearly a quarter
of a century later than the ‘ Contributions,” the first volume having
been published in 1862.

As estimated by the number of volumes published during the period
of its existence, now amounting to thirty-three, this series (as was to
have been expected) has grown about twice as rapidly as the former.

In addition to these two classes of works, published at the expense
of the Smithsonian fund, three other series of works are issued under
the direction of the Institution, the publication of which is provided for
by Congressional appropriations.

Of these, first in order may be mentioned the Annual Reports to Con-
gress of the Board of Regents of the Institution, in accordance with the
provisions of Revised Statutes, section 5593, enacting that the Board
shall submit to Congress at each session thereof a report of the opera-
tions, expenditures, and condition of the Institution. These are in
octavo form, and have gradually increased in bulk from a few hundred
pages to two thick volumes per annum. Although printed by the Gen-
eral Government, these reports have been a constant and increasing
charge upon the funds of the Institution, required by the preparation
of suitable material for the usual appendix, in illustration of particular
investigations, or of the principal advances made in science. For a
number of years past the expenditure for this purpose has amounted to
several thousand dollars for each year, and it has become a serious
question whether we can longer afford to bear the burden. If Congress
can be induced to make a small appropriation for the collection and
preparation of information relative to the annual progress in the United
States of scientific discovery, and of its technological applications, to
be appended to the Smithsonian Report, such a record would not only
be in keeping with the great objects of this Institution, but would main-
tain for its report its high popular and educational character as well as
promote the industrial interests of our country, and the trifling expend-
iture would seem to be well justified by the precedents of similar appro-
priations for obtaining and diffusing valuable information through the
medium of the Agricultural and other official reports.

In the original “ programme of organization,” approved by the Regents
December 8, 1847, was specified among the details of the plan for diffus-
ing knowledge ‘“ the publication of a series of reports giving an account
of the new discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to
year in all branches of knowledge not strictly professional.” And it was

added, “‘ The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the
different branches of knowledge.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

In the Smithsonian Report for 1854 appeared for the first time an “ap-
pendix,” containing an account of American explorations for the years
1853 and 1854, by Prof. S. F. Baird; a full report of lectures delivered
before the Institution by Marsh, Brainard, Loomis, Channing, Reed, and
Russell; extracts from the scientific correspondence of the Institution ;
and miscellaneous papers relating to American archeology, geology,
ete. This general appendix to the Annual Report of the Regents has
been regularly continued to the present time (for more than the third of
a century), and has served to bring the Smithsonian Report into great
popular demand.

In the Report for 1880 (after the abandonment by the publishing
house—the Harpers, of New York-—of an ‘Annual Record of Science
and Industry”), a systematic ‘‘ Record of Scientific Progress,” compiled
by various specialists, was made the principal feature of the general ap-
pendix by my predecessor. This annual scientific summary, however
acceptable and however conformable to the plans originally laid down,
has labored under two very serious difficulties: First, that from the vex-
atious delay of publication the record of recent science lost much of its
interest and value; and, secondly, that the expense of its preparation
(averaging $2,500 per annum) has become more and more a tax upon
the Smithsonian income that could be but illy afforded. To this may
be added a practical difficulty in getting all the different summaries
completed at the time of making up the general appendix, so that an
omission of one or more branches occurred in every report. Under these
circumstances, it has become a serious question as to the manner in
which this appendix to the Report is to be maintained, if maintained
at all.

An additional complication of the question may be referred to, arising
out of the construction given to an act of Congress approved August
4, 1886, and since continued from year to year, which prescribes that
heads of departments ‘ before transmitting their annual reports to Con-
gress, the printing of which is chargeable to this appropriation, shall
cause the same to be carefully examined, and shall exclude therefrom
all matter including engravings, maps, drawings, and illustrations, ex-
cept such as they shall certify in their letters transmitting such reports
to benecessary, and to relate entirely to the transaction of public busi-
ness.” (Statutes, Forty-ninth Congress, first session; chapter 902,
page 255.)

This restriction has been held by the Public Printer to apply equally
to the reports of the Regents to Congress, which are printed under the
provisions of this appropriation. This consideration seems to furnish
an additional reason for having the supplementary matter of the report
placed under a special clause of authorization, for the avoidance of all
question as to the “necessity and entire relation to the public business”
of such general scientific information.

The second series to be mentioned under this head consists of the
24 , REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

publications of the U.S. National Museum, comprising its “ Bulletins”
and its “Proceedings.” The Bulletins of the National Museum were
instituted for the purpose of furnishing a prompt publication of origi-
nal descriptions of specimens received, and of thus illustrating the
mineral, botanical, zoological, and ethnological collections belonging to
the Museum. They consist of monographs on biological subjects, check-
lists, taxonomic systems, ete., and are prepared mainly by the curators
and other attachés of the establishment. This series was commenced
in 1875, and now numbers thirty-two Bulletins. These memoirs, from
their variety of subject, are naturally of very unequal extent, ranging
from fifty to over one thousand pages. Collected, they form nine large-
sized octavo volumes. , é

The Proceedings of the National Museum consist of shorter and less
elaborate papers, designed to give early accounts of its recent acces-
sions, or of freshly acquired facts relating to natural history, ete., and
are promptly issued in single “ signatures,” as soon as matter sufficient
to fill sixteen pages has been prepared, the date of issue being given
on each signature. These “ Proceedings” thus partake of the character
of an irregular periodical, the numbers of which—contintously paged—
form an annual volume.

This series was commenced in 1878, and now extends to nine annual _
volumes, averaging about 650 pages, and illustrated with numerous
wood-cut plates. Both these series of publications of the National
Museum have hitherto been printed at the expense of a fund under the
authority of the Interior Department; but it is proposed to ask for
legislation which will permit them to be printed at the Government
Printing Office on the requisition of your secretary.

The third and last series to be mentioned comprises the annual re-
ports of the Bureau of Ethnology, which are large-sized volumes of royal
octavo form, well printed and well illustrated with cuts and lithographic
plates. These volumes (of which four only have thus far been issued, but
of which the material for four more awaits the printer) present matter
of great interest to the anthropologist, and in their production reflect
credit upon the scientific staff of the Bureau of Ethnology.

Distribution of publications.—Since the diffusion of knowledge, next
to efforts for its increase, is one of the principal functions and duties of
the Institution, it would doubtless be desirable if we could offer a copy
of its works to every intelligent inquirer specially interested in any
subject of which some of these volumes might treat. Since, however,
the Institution can not afford to print, in ordinary cases, more than
from 1,250 to 1,500 copies of one work, three-fourths of which are required
to be supplied to our regular list of “ correspondents,” for the mainte-
nance of our exchange series, it has been found necessary to restrict the
gratuitous distribution to these, and to hold the small reserve, more
strictly than in earlier times, for sale to those sufficiently interested to
purchase them.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

The remarks made on this subject by the first secretary so long ago
as 1850, are no less pertinent to-day: ‘It must be evident that from the
small portjon of the income which can be devoted to this object the
distribution must be circumscribed. Fifteen hundred copies of each
memoir have been printed; but this number, though ail that the in-
come could furnish, has not been found sufficient to meet a tenth part
of the demand. It should be recollected that though these memoirs
consist of the results of new investigations of the highest importance to
the well-being of man in extending the bounds of his knowledge of the
universe of mind and matter of which he forms a part, yet they are not
in all cases of such a character as to be immediately appreciated by the
popular mind, and indeed they are better adapted to instruct the teacher
than to interest the general reader. They should therefore be dis-
tributed in such a way as most readily to meet the eye of those who
will make the best use of them in diffusing a knowledge of their con-
tents.”

That our present circulation, however, is placed on a liberal basis,
is sufficiently shown by the published conditions on which we are en-
abled still to offer them gratuitously. This distribution is made, first,
to those learned societies of the first class which give to the Institution
in return complete sets of their own publications. Secondly, to colleges
of the first class furnishing catalogues of their libraries and students,
and publications relative to their organization and history. Thirdly, to
public libraries in this country having twenty-five thousand volumes.
Fourthly, they are presented in some cases to still smaller libraries,
especially if no other copies of the Smithsonian publications are given
in the same place and a large district would be otherwise unsupplied.
Lastly, to institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion of particular
branches of knowledge, such of its publications are given as relate to
their special objects.

These rules apply chiefly to distribution in the United States. The
number sent to foreign countries, under somewhat different conditions,
is about the same as that distributed in this country.

Economy of publication demanded.—In view of the natural expansion
of the Smithsonian operations with advancing years, with its resources
fixed to a rigidly measured income which, as I have already observed,
isitself undergoing a slow depreciation in intrinsic value or actual pur-
chasing power, it would seem that some curtailment will be necessary
in the appropriations for preparing and printing the works that may be
offered. In looking to see in what direction this economy may be
most advantageously exercised it has seemed to me that a more critical
supervision over the series of ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collections” might be
adopted so as fo limit it to works of a more general interest or of
a higher scientific. value. This series already extending (as above
Stated) to thirty-three volumes, has included a number of the Museum
Bulletins and Proceedings as well as the proceedings of several scien-
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tific societies established in this city. In the infancy of the Philosoph-
ical, the Anthropological, and the Biological Societies of Washington,
this form of patronage appeared to be a very proper methéd of pro-
moting the increase and diffusion of knowledge. But now that these
societies are well established on a permanent basis, with a large mem-
bership for each, such a support appears to be less required. In like
manner the publications of the National Museum being provided for by
a Congressional appropriation, this Institution may well relinquish the
expense of any re-issue of them, while still employing its exchange
service for the gratuitous transmission of such copies of the “ Bulle-
tins” and * Proceedings” as may be intrusted to its care. Thus far
eight volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections have been occupied
with these issues, to wit: Volumes XIII, XIX, XXII, XXIII, and XXIV,
with the publications of the National Museum; and Volumes xx,
XXV, and XXxIII, with those of the societies named. I propose to
discard these from the series in the future and to make such other
restrictions aS may seem judicious under present conditions. In con-
nection with this I have had in mind the renewal of an experiment
made by your first secretary of placing (in certain exceptional cases)
the excess of copies beyond those regularly distributed, in the hands of
a publisher.

With regard to the quarto series of Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge there will probably be no occasion to suggest any change,
at least for the present.

THE SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGE SYSTEM.

The “ diffusion cf knowledge among men,” which, next to its ‘in-
crease,” is the reason for the existence of this Institution, has been, ever
since its foundation, largely carried out by means of the exchange sys-
tem, under which all knowledge, but especially new knowledge, as em-
bodied in scientific and other literature, is disseminated by the gratu-
itous efforts of the Smithsonian.

The system of-exchanges, even in its present condition, involved in
188687, the shipping of about ten thousand domestic and over forty
thousand foreign packages of books, and this has been increased to over
twelve thousand domestic and sixty-two thousand foreign packages by
the operations of the past year.

Before the writer’s connection with the Smithsonian Institution he
had abundant opportunity to know that the regard and confidence in
which it is held by all scientific men did not prevent a then general rec-
ognition of the fact that its exchange system did not work the benefits
contemplated, in that it took a time which ordinarily seemed excessive
to send a package toe Europe or to get one in return.

The writer having been assigned to the charge of exchanges on his
first connection with the Institution as Assistant Secretary, gave early
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. PA (

attention to this subject. The result of his investigation appears to
show that the reproach for delay was then well founded, but that the
blame did not lie at the door of the Institution, which did not, and does
not, possess the means to efficiently fulfill the tasks now imposed upon
it. He hopes some improvement has already been effected ; but much
doubtless remains to be done.

In the early period of the history of the exchanges nearly all trans-
portation was slow, but if it took the Smithsonian two or three months
to send a package to Europe and as much to bring it back, it took the
private individual the same time. The early steam-ship lines, then or a
little later, generously aided the Smithsonian plan by giving the ex-
changes free transportation, a privilege which the Institution has often
used, but now that rapid transportation is general, does not wish to
abuse by making a request that such companies should continue to
transport the whole of its greatly increased freight without charge.

There is another reason why they should not be requested to do so
in the fact that the character of the freight the exchange department
sends has changed, as the greater part of it is now the property of the
nation, and if the General Government desires this to go by rapid transit,
it is certainly able to pay for it. As Congress does not pay for rapid
transit, it is a reasonable conclusion that it does not desire it, but it
may be doubted whether either the extent of the actual use of the
Smithsonian exchanges by the Government or the degree of delay of
governmental business is understood.

To bring the facts in the case to mind let me reeall, first, that the
original exchange system commenced in 1846, and, second, that after
twenty years of useful work exclusively in the interests of knowledge,
an entirely new duty was imposed upon it by the act of March, 1867,
which established the International Exchange of Government Publica-
tions and made the Smithsonian Institution the agency for this ex-
change, giving it for distribution 50 copies of all documents printed
by order of either house of Congress, 50 additional copies of all docu-
ments printed in excess of the usual number, together with 50 of each
publication issued by any Department or Bureau of the Government ;
while the resolution of July 25, 1868, makes it obligatory upon the De-
partments to furnish 50 copies of each publication issued by them,
wherever printed.

Accordingly, of late years, there has been added to the primitive
Smithsonian exchange system and merged with it the additional feature
of carrying the Government’s exchanges.

The Institution possessed unequaled experience and facilities for
such work, and though the uew class of books brought to its exchange
department was partly foreign to its original object, the propriety of
its assuming such a service, if the Government’s interests could be pro-
moted by this experience, is evident. It certainly, however, was not
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to have been anticipated that the Institution should conduct a purely
administrative work for the General Government out of its private
funds, as it appears to have done for thirteen years from 1868 to 1881,
when the first appropriation of $3,000 was made by Congress.* If we
look back to the commencement of the Government system we find that
up to1880, inclusive, the Smithsonian had paid $92,386.29 for exchanges,
of which it is estimated that more than two-thirds were on Government
account, for which the Government paid nothing whatever. Subse-
quently to 1880, as the foot-note more exactly shows, the service has cost
$96,065.85, for which the Government has paid $57,500, leaving nearly
$30,000 of the cost to be borne by the Smithsonian Institution, and this
exclusive of the rent of the rooms, which represents about $3,000 a
year more.

All exchanges are now conducted by Government, but here ‘“‘ Govern-
mental” signifies all publications received from or for any bureau or office
of this or any Government, and ‘“ Miscellaneous” all others.+

It would appear that there is no doubt that in the intent of Congress,
as expressed in the act of 1881, these appropriations should now be ap-
plied indifferently to all exchanges, whether to those which it under-
takes for the Congressional publications, for those of governmental
bureaus, or for other literary and scientific objects ; but the amount as-

t Under the classification whieh has prevailed heretofore the publications passing
through the exchange office have been divided into ‘‘ official” and ‘literary and
scientific,” meaning by the former designation only the publications furnished by
the Public Printer for distribution among the national libraries of the Governments
participating in the international exchanges, and including in the latter aJl of the
publications sent or received by the bureaus of this Government in direct ex-
change with the bureaus of others, and for the benefit of the bureau libraries. The
classification appears to be misleading, since this latter subdivision of the exchanges
is quite as strictly official, or for the service of the Government, as the former. I
have therefore directed that hereafter all publications issued or received by the Gov-
ernment, whether by legislative, judicial, or Executive authority, shall be desig-
nated as “Governmental,” and all others as ‘‘ Miscellaneous.” ;
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

signed is inadequate for the proper conduct even of the former, as has
just been shown.*

Having been assigned to the charge of the international exchanges
when Assistant Secretary, the writer has always taken particular inter-
est in this part of the work of the Institution; but so far as its suecess
depends upon the provision by Congress of the indispensable means to
meet the expenses which it has just been shown that the Government
connection has made needful, his labors have been but partially sue-
cessful. The department of exchanges, however, has continued to be
the object of more than usual attention, first under the immediate care
of the writer, and iater under that of Dr. J. H. Kidder, appointed cura-
tor of laboratory and exchanges on the 19th of March, 1888.

Ithas been remarked that the present system is unsatisfactory because
of the delay involved, while it will shortly be shown that the expenses
of shipment by a prompt and efficiently conducted system would be sub-
stantially the same per ton of freight as by the present inefficient and slow
one, which is largely carried on by what might be called the charity of
the transportation lines. Unsatisfactory as is the service, however, and
necessarily conducted as it is (under the present appropriations) in a
manner prejudicial to every interest concerned with it, these appropria-
tions do not, as we have seen, meet all the inevitable expenditures, and
the deficiency still continues to be met from the proper funds of the
Institution.

The expense for the service for this fiscal year has been $15,113.75,
of which sum $12,000 were voted by Congress and $205.75 were re-
funded by the Patent Office, Signal Office, and a correspondent in
South America, leaving a net deficit of $2,908, paid by the Smithsonian
fund. In the coming fiscal year, at the present rate of expenditure,
the cost will be $16,050, making no allowance for the usual annual in-
crease in the quantity of business or for increased salaries of employés.
The domestic exchanges, it will be understood, form no part of this
estimate. Finally, it should be stated that nearly every department of
the Government has some small appropriation to partially cover serv-
ices which should be gratuitously rendered.

Recurring now to one of the effects of this insufficient appropriation,
the writer repeats that there are too many and too great delays in the
transit of packages sent by the international exchanges. These delays
do not occur in the office at Washington, nor in those of the agents of
the Institution at London and Leipzig. They are due, broadly speak-
ing, to the fact just stated that the Institution has not the means to

* The act approved in 1882 reads, ‘‘ For expenses of the international exchanges be-
tween the United States and foreign countries, in accordance with the Paris conven-
tion of 1877;” and this wording is repeated in 1883. Although the phrase referring
to the Paris convention was afterwards dropped from the law, there seems to be no
doubt that it has fixed its meaning, since the point has been raised more than once

by the accounting officers of the Treasu ry, and so decided.
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

pay for rapid transit on land or sea, and that for what it obtains on the
latter itis dependent upon the courtesy of several ocean steam-ship
companies, with the natural result that the free freight is often delayed
to make room for that which is paid for.* A subordinate cause, how-
ever, lies in the apathy or indifference, or possible insufficient clerical
force, of most of the foreign-exchange bureaus.

In a recent test case parcels shipped on the same day to London,
Leipzig, and Paris, with letters requesting immediate notification of
receipt, were acknowledged by the agents of the Institution at London
on the fourteenth day, at Leipzig on the fifteenth, and by the Bureau
des Echanges at Paris on the fortieth day.

In the hope of insuring a regular and certain ocean-steamer service,
I requested, on the 30th of May last, through the honorable Secretary
of the Treasury, an increase in the appropriation for the fiscal year
1888—89 to $27,050, based upon a careful consideration of the cost of
“fast freight” at the ordinary commercial rates and upon the quantity
of material which past experience has made probable.

The following brief statement wil. give the essential facts on which
the application was based.

It should be premised that only about one-third of the Government’s
publications are actually received from the office of the Public Printer
and elsewhere, for transmission abroad, and that while special appli-
cation on our part might call out the remainder, we can not under-
take to do this while only partly paid the actual outlay for the portion
we carry already, while a sufficient appropriation to justify the employ-
ment of a special exchange agent in Europe, as has been frequently and
earnestly recommended by the Librarian of Congress, would bring back
in return probably about eight times what we now receive. Accord-
ingly, in the subjoined estimate of what should be done, if Congress
paid the actual cost of efficient service (the services of the officers of
this Institution being given without charge), more packages appear
under the new plan than under the old.

*A shipment sent from Rome in December, 1887, for example, lay at Naples until
the latter part of March, 1888, before the steam-ship company forwarded it.

The following memorandum appears in the Congressional Record of
July 29, 1888, page 7666, and contains the leading facts in a succinet
form:

* International Exchanges.—Present system established by resolution
of Congress approved March 2, 1867, and by subsequent legislation.
Fifty copies of all Government publications put at disposal of Commit-
tee on Library for international exchange.

Uniform system agreed upon at international geographical conference,
Paris, 1875, and modified by conferences for this particular purpose at
Brussels in 1880, 1883, and 1886. Treaty now before Senate is the re-
sult of these conferences. There is now no completed treaty obligation.
England, Germany, and France have declined to ratify the treaty, and
were not represented at the last conference.

The Smithsonian is not concerned with the system otherwise than as
the agent of the Government, but has paid a material part of the cost
annually from its private fund.

As the office is now organized the annual expenditure is at the fol-
lowing rates:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 393

This means ‘slow’ freight, and for the most part gratuitous, on the
ocean. Theaverage time for transmission of a parcel to western Europe
is now thirty-six days. By ordinary fast freight it could be reduced to
sixteen days. Extraordinary delays occur frequently because of the
fact that the freight is carried gratuitously. Boxes shipped from Rome,
for example, in December last were held in Naples three months by the
steam-ship line because its steamer’s space was all filled by paying
freight. The same thing has occurred frequently on this side of the
ocean. As at present organized, the Smithsonian sends out about one-
third of the United States Government publications, and receives from
foreign governments less than one-tenth of their official publications,
Very much is thus lost which is of great interest and value to our Goy-
ernment offices.

Many of the Executive Departments which wish to use the exchange
system are obliged to adopt other measures at considerably increased
cost. Some of them have special appropriations to defray part of the

cost of special transmissions by the Smithsonian.

The sum estimated tor ($27,050), is the result of careful calculation,
based upon a comparison of the details of the business for several years
back. It is the Secretary’s opinion that it will far more than repay it-
self by an increased efficiency in the service and by the number of val-
uable works which it will bring to Congress and the Executive Depart-
ments of the Government.”

f am aware that it hardly lies within the power of the Regents as a
body to correct the evils I have referred to, but I present this summary
and imperfect statement of them, in the hope that those of the Regents
who are legislators will perhaps be able and willing, in their individual
capacity, to do something to remedy the state of things which I have
just shown to be actually existing.

I have represented a wearisome and trying matter very briefly. For
a statement more at large of the actual condition of the exchanges, I
beg to refer to the valuable report made to the Secretary by theecurator
of exchanges, which will be found in the appendix.

Preparation of new exchange lists.—In March, 1887, the writer, then
Assistant Secretary, acting under the general instructions of the Seere-
tary, Professor Baird, with a view to perfecting the collections of the
Smithsonian Library so that they might include scientific periodicals
published throughout the world, where these were obtainable by ex-
change, undertook to ascertain as far as possible the names of all useful
(particularly of all modern) publications which were not on the old
Smithsonian lists. ;

To do this it was necessary to get information not existing in print,
and as the search for the names of desired publications was necessarily
on an extended scale, it seemed proper to enlist as many expert coad.
jutors as possible. To this end the principal branches of human
knowledge to the number of thirty were indexed on as many separate
lists. Several copies were made of each list, and then it was sought,
by sending a copy of each to an eminent specialist in the branch in

H. Mis. 142 3

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

question, to enlist his services as a coadjutor by obtaining from him
a list of the publications not actually on our records which would be
most desirable in his own department.

Medicine was omitted, but Belles Lettres, History, Law, Fine Arts,
and, in fact, Theology are evidently to be considered even in a purely
scientific list, at least so far as they illustrate anthropology.

Periodicals devoted to science in its more restricted interpretation
generally fall under one of two great divisions :

First, those connected with the biological, and second, those connected
with the physical, sciences.

As the former are represented by many distinguished specialists
connected with the Smithsonian Institution as curators in the Museum
there was at first prepared a circular letter (Appendix IV) to these bio-
logical curators, requesting them to furnish—

(1) ‘A list of those periodicals, whether transactions of societies or
otherwise, which were deemed most nearly indispensable to their re-
spective departments ; ” and

(2) “A list of recent serials, whether transactions or otherwise, of
interest in connection with the special investigations of the curators,
even if not exclusively devoted to them.”

Pending the replies, which related almost altogether to biology, the
writer himself prepared a list of the main divisions and subdivisions of
physical science meant, with the preceding exceptions, to represent
every department of knowledge outside of the biological sciences.

This list was submitted in April to Professors F. A. P. Barnard,
Samuel H. Scudder, and H. Carrington Bolton, with the requests—

First. ‘To examine the list and see whether these headings them-
selves are judiciously chosen; ” and

Next. ‘To indicate the names of the two most fitting persons, under
each head, to give advice as to the periodicals belonging to their re-
spective departments.” The list was also submitted to the Hon. A. R.
Spoftord, Librarian of Congress, and Mr. William J. Rhees, the Chief
Clerk of the Smithsonian Institution.

A full list of the names of eminent specialists who could advise in each
branch having been thus obtained, and the classification of subjects
having been determined in the manner above indicated, circular letters
(in three forms) were forwarded on the 9th of May, 1887. <A third or
supplementary circular (in two forms) was mailed on the 15th of June,
1887. One of these, which willi ndicate the general character of all, is
given in Appendix LV.

The cireular letter of March 19, sent to twenty-six curators of the Na-
tional Museum, was responded to by twenty-two curators, among whom
Prof. L. F. Ward was pre-eminent for the extent and character of the
lists of periodicals specified (352 titles).

Of the circulars of May 9 and June 15, 1887, 274 copies were sent out

The result of the inquiry was to bring in 5,730 names, of which, after
deducting those found on more than one list, 3,594 independent titles
remain; but of these, as will appear, a considerable portion was on our
list already. It may be interesting, however, to notice how these titles
are distributed throughout the world, the little tables in the foot-note*
giving incidentally an interesting exposition of the activities of different
peoples as well as of different professions in this direction.

articles) are found to reach the enormous number of 3,594; and yet
these by no means comprise, as it will be seen, all that the Smithsonian
lists contain.

Five thousand seven hundred and thirty names were in fact received,
but many of these were duplicates, after striking out which, 3,594 titles
remain, and a careful investigation by Mr. Boehmer, then in charge of
exchanges, shows that of these, 2,328 were foreign, and 1,266 were
domestic; and that of the foreign titles but 792 were on our old lists.
As regards these latter, then, the final result of the inquiry is the nearly
trebling of our foreign lists by adding to them 1,536 new titles (con-
sisting largely of periodicals begun in the past twelve or fifteen years),
and this list will be used by the library in obtaining, so far as possible,
the periodicals themselves.

LIBRARY.

Chiefly through its exchange system, the Smithsonian had in 1865
accumulated about forty thousand volumes, largely publications of
learned societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the
world in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of
the human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of at
least every branch of positive science since the days of revival of let-
ters until the present time.*

These books, in many cases presents from old European libraries,
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best
collections of the kind in the world.

The danger incurred from the fire of that year, and the fact that the
greater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into in-
sufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to
be incurred for this binding, enlarged room, and other purposes con-
nected with their use threatened to grow beyond the means of the In-
stitution, appear to have been the moving causes which determined the
Regents to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place the
Smithsonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the right of
the Regents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of binding,
etc. Owing to the same causes (which have affected the Library of
Congress itself) these principal conditions, except as regards their
custody in a fire proof building, have never been fulfilled.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they
have now accumulated from 40,000 to fully 250,000 volumes and parts
of volumes, and form without doubt the most valuable collection of the
kind in existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more
crowded and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer.
It is hardly necessary to add that these facts are deplored by no one
more than by the present efficient Librarian of Congress, who would, I
am confident, gladly give, as far as it lies in his power, effect to any ex-

*See Smithsorian Report of 1867.
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

pression of the wish of the Regents that in the new building a hall or
halls worthy of this really magnificent collection of a quarter of a mill-
ion titles should be exclusively devoted to it, under the name of the
‘Smithsonian Halls”, or in any such other method as may point it out
as an acquisition of national importance due to the Institution under
the Regents’ care.

It will be remembered that a small portion of these volumes, repre-
senting in number something like one-twentieth of the whole, is ordi-
narily retained for consultation in the National Museum.

A certain limited number of books, chiefly of works of reference,
obtained by purchase from the Smithsonian fund, is kept in the Smith-
sonian building, under the titles of “The Secretary’s Library” and
‘ Wditor’s Library.”

With these exceptions, it will be understood that a large part of the
Smithsonian exchange system, and a considerable portion of the best
rooms in the main building of the Smithsonian, continue to be given to
this portion of the Library of Congress without any return.

On April 1, 1887, upon the resignation of Miss J. A. Turner, who had
for many years performed the duties of librarian with the greatest dili-
gence and faithfulness, the provisions for the care of the books supplied
to the Congressional Library were reorganized under the regulations
which I had prepared upon my appointment as assistant secretary.*
Mr. John Murdoch, formerly assistant librarian in the National Mu-
seum, was appointed librarian in Miss ‘Turner’s place, and was also
given the charge of the collection of books kept in the Museum as a
working library for the use of the curators and other officers.

A force of three clerks was detailed to report to the librarian, in
order to enable him to carry out the new regulations, which require
greater promptness in disposing of accessions than it was possible to
effect when one person alone was employed on this work. All acces.
sions received during any week must now be completely recorded and
ready for a final disposition to be made of them on the Saturday of the
same week. All accessions, as heretofore, except the comparatively
few retained for use at the Institution, and certain medical publications
which are specially loaned to the library of the Surgeon-General’s Office,
U.S. Army, are sent to the Library of Congress.

Publications retained for the use of the Institution must, under the
regulations, be entered and ready for use within twenty-four hours
from the time they are received.

A “full entry” of any publication, according to the regulations, is
“to consist of both a day-book and a ledger account entry.”

The day-book is simply a continuation of the old Smithsonian record
of accessions, in which the running numbers reached on June 30, 1888,
182,059. The ledger account is supplementary to the manuscript cata-
logue in thirteen large bound volumes, called ‘** Publications of Learned

* These regulations are given in n Appendix Vv.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

Societies, Periodicals, ete., in the Library of the Smithsonian Institu
tion,” which was complete up to April i, 1587. The new record is kept
on large cards, one for each institution or individual from whom the In-
stitution has received any publication, and on each card is entered the
title of everything received from the person or institution whose name
appears at the head of the card, each marked with its aecession or
‘‘day-book” number, by means of which reference can be made to the
“day-book” for further particulars. These cards are now arranged
alphabetically by the name of the donor’s residence.

These regulations have been carried out without failure since the re-
organization of the library, though there have been weeks when, owing
to the arrival of large invoices through the department of foreign ex-
changes, the librarian and his clerks have been hard pressed to com-
plete the work in the time specified. Upwards of five hundred acces-
sions have been recorded in a single week.

The books destined for the Library of Congress are sent regularly on
Monday of each week, and it is impossible for publications to be delayed
at the Institution for the length of time which was frequently unavoid-
able under the former arrangements. It is, however, to be regretted
that the Librarian of Congress is unable to take advantage of the in-
creased promptness of the Smithsonian library administration. Owing,
as I am informed, to the pressure of copyright work and the over-
crowded condition of the present quarters of the Library, the chests
sent up from the Institution frequently lie for months unopencd, so that
their contents are inaccessible to readers.

This is the more to be regretted as, on account of the limited space
at the disposal of the Institution for keeping books and periodicals, only
the most important publications can be retained for use here.

The books thus retained for use at the Institution form part of the
National Museum library (the rest of which consists of such publica-
tions as are donated directly to the Museum or purchased from the
Museum appropriation for the use of its curators), and are loaned under
certain necessary conditions to the officers of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the Smithsonian editor, the scientific staff of the Museum, and
such persons as are authorized to borrow books by special written per-
mission from one of the officers of the Smithsonian Institution.

How important these contributions from the Smithsonian accessions
are to the Museum library may be seen from the faet that out of the
6,053 accessions to the Museum library (including parts of regular
serials) during the fiscal year, 5,045, or a trifle more than 50 per cent.,
were from this source.

From lack of space in the Museum library it had been practically
impossible to provide for the proper display of new accessions to the
library, and especially of the current numbers of periodicals. At my
- direction, therefore, the librarian prepared plans for a reading-room in
the Smithsonian Building. This room was opened to readers in the-
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

latter part of April, 1887, and has remained in active use since then
It now contains the current numbers of two hundred and sixty-five se-
rials, embracing most of the chief scientific and technical publications,
and including also a few of the more important literary periodicals. It
is much used by the employés of the Smithsonian Institution and the
Museum, and to a less degree by other persons in Washington who
wish to consult the scientific periodicals. Such a scientific reading-
room has long been needed at the Institution, and the one now in opera-
tion appears to fill the want satisfactorily.

The policy that has been pursued in regard to the library has been,
in general, to obtain as large and as valuable a return as possible for
the works published by the Institution, and to make the best possible
use of these returns when they are received. With this end in view,
the librarian has been instructed to watch for all opportunities of ob-
taining new publications by exchange and to bring to my knowledge
every occasion of this kind. The results of this increased activity in
seeking new exchanges are to be seen in the fact that for the fiscal year
188788 the total number of accessions amounted to 18,948, an increase
of 2,401 over the total number for the preceding fiscal year (1886—87),
which was 16,547.

As has been previously stated, 3,045 of these accessions have been
transferred to the Museum library, and, in addition to these, 675 med-
ical dissertations have been loaned to the library of the Surgeon-Gen-
eral’s Office, U.S. Army. The remainder, 15,228 in number, have been
transferred to the Library of Congress. It is impossible, as it seems to
me, not to consider this as an ample return for whatever expense the
Library of Congress is put to in paying for the recording of these acces-
sions. :

ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Collections of living Animals.—it has been customary, ever since the
Institution commenced to form collections, that skeletons and skins of
wild animals should be sent here for preparation, so that a certain reg-
ular supply of such material now comes in without solicitation every
year, together with occasional live animals, which have been usually
sent to the Zoological Gardens in Philadelphia. It seemed to me worth
while to try the experiment of having all animals sent on alive when
this could be done without enhanced cost; and thus has been formed
the nucleus of a collection of living animals, which, though still small,
has attracted the popular interest in a very marked degree.

It is understood that this interest, and the consideration that the
buffalo, the mountain sheep and goat, the elk, and other vanishing races
of the continent deserve protection at the hands of the Government,
was the cause of a bill which was introduced by Senator Beck to create
a Zoological Garden on Rock Creek, such that these animals might not
only form the subject of study, but be expected to increase as they do
not do inordinary captivity.

I present herewith the amendment to the sundry civil appropriation
bill reported by Senator Morrill, of the Committee on Public Buildings
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

and Grounds, June 4, 1888. This is identical with the bill proposed by

,

Senator Beck April 25, 1885 (S. 2752), which was read twice and re-
ferred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds with the ad-
ditions of the paragraphs inclosed in brackets.

This establishment it is proposed, when completed, to place under
the care of the Regents, with a proper provision for its maintenance.
The bill has not yet become a law, but in the event of its doing so, the
trust created, being in the interest of knowledge, and incidentally offer-
ing amost obvious means for its popular diffusion, seems to be one which
falls entirely within the proper function of the Smithsonian Institution,
and I hope I may beable to state that the trust is one of a nature which
the Regents, if called upon, are likely to favor.

[A BILL for the establishment of a zoological park in the District of Columbia. ]

That, in order to establish a Zoological Park in the District of Colum-
bia, for the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of
the people, a commission shall be constituted, composed of three persons,
namely: the Secretary of the Interior, the president of the board of
Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, which shall be known and designated as the
commission for the establishment of a zoological park.

That the said commission is hereby authorized and directed to make
an inspection of the country along Rock Creek, beginning at the point
on that creek where the Woodley road crosses said creek, and extend.
ing upward along its course to where said creek is crossed by the
Klingle road, and to select from that district of country such a tract of
land, of not more than one hundred acres, which shall include a section
of the creek, as said commission shall deem to be suitable and appro-
priate for a zoological park.

That the said commission shall cause to be made a careful map of said
zoological park, showing the location, quantity, and character of each
parcel of private property to be taken for such purpose, with the names
of the respective owners inscribed thereon, and the said map shall be
filed and recorded in the public records of the District of Columbia;
and from and after that date the several tracts and parcels of land em-
braced in such zoological park shall be held as condemned for public
uses, Subject to the payment of just compensation, to be determined by
the said commission and approved by the President of the United
States, provided that such compensation be accepted by the owner or
owners of the several parcels of land.

That if the said commission shall be unable to purchase any portion
of the land so selected and condemned within thirty days after such

That when the said commission shall have established a zoological
park in the District of Columbia under the provisions of this act, by ac-
quiring the necessary lands and by laying out the same as a park and
by the erection of the necessary buildings, thereupon it shall be the
duty of said commission to turn over the said zoological park, with all
its buildings and appurtenances, to the custody and care of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution ; and when such transfer of the custody
and care of the zoological park shall be made, the duties of said com-
mission shall cease and its existence terminate.

That when the said commission shall tender to the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution the care and custody of the zoological park pro-
vided for in this act, the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are
hereby authorized to assume the care and custody of the same; and
the said Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are hereby authorized
to make such rules and regulations for the management of the park,
and of the property, appurtenances, and collections of the park, as they
may deem necessary and wise to secure the use of the same for the ad-
yancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people.

[That the said commission is hereby authorized to call upon the Di-
rector of the Geological Survey to make such surveys as may be neces-
sary to carry into effect the provisions of this act; and the Director of
the Geological Survey is hereby authorized and required to make such
surveys under the direction of said commission. |

I will take this occasion to observe that we have found great liberal-
ity in the donors of specimens. Among those to whom we are especially
indebted is the Hon. Eugene G. Blackford, commissioner of fisheries
for the State of New York, and an old and valued supporter of the
work of the Institution, who has presented us with two buffaloes, an
animal now become so rare as to have a high money value.

The proposition for the establishment of a National Zoological Park

has met with a very surprising amount of support from all parts of the
United States.*

*'The followi ing e extract from ‘Public Opinion ” will serve to give somewhat of an
idea of the character and extent of this support:

[Public Opinion, New York.]

The National Zoological Park.—Of all the bills that have been introduced in Con-
gress this session, no other has been more universally approved by the press than
Senator Beck’s bill for the establishment of a National Zoological Park at Washing-
ton, on a grand and liberal scale, ‘‘ for the advancement of science and the instruc-
tion and recreation of the people.” With all our great game animals being swept
out of existence by modern breech-loaders, a magnificent site within 2 miles of the
Executive Mansion, a huge surplus in the Treasury, gifts of live animals pouring into

ART AND MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS,

Art collections.—The words of your first secretary, that the Institution
»xists for knowledge in the highest seise, including not only science
commonly so called, bit “the trie, the beaiitifttl; as Well as the immedi-
ately practical,” remind us that one of the lines on which the Lnstitiitioil
was to develop according to the views of Congress, that of its counec-
tion with art, has been allowed almost entirely to lapse. It is now, how-
ever, understood that a very valuable collection of art objects, repre-
senting, perhaps, over $1,000,000 in value, has been left to the Smith-
sonian Institution; and it is not an abstract question when we ask
what these relations are to be. It seems to me that here again‘the fact
of the independence of the Smithsonian is of inestimable value in its
possible future usefulness. No possessor of a great private gallery like
either of the two or three in this country which are rising now to al-
most national importance—no possessor of such a gallery, Knowing on
the one hand what art is and on the other hand what the relations of
the Government to art have been in the past, is likely to bequeath it
to the nation without some guaranty, not only for its care and mainte-
nance, but for its judicious use in the cause of national art itself.

the Smithsonian, the public clamoring for a National ‘‘ Zoo,” and a competent natu-
ralist ready and anxious te build it up, what reason is there why the bill should not
be passed and work begun at ‘once? If it is neglected much longer some of our
grandest game species will have become so nearly extinct it will be almost, if not
quite, impossible to procure living representatives of them at any price. At the rate
mountain goats are now being killed off for their pelts five years hence it will be im-
possible to procure a living specimen. A live buffalo is now worth from $500 to
$1,000, according te sex and size, whereas three or four years ago they were worth
only one-fifth as much. Asan index to public sentiment in regard to the proposed zo-
ologizal patk at Washington, we may quote a few editorial expressions from our ex-
changes. It 1s interesting to note the unanimity of the opiniens that come to us in
journals of all kinds and parties, from Boston to San Franciscv. The Boston Globe
exclaims: ‘“‘Give us a National Zoo. Senator Beck has introduced a bill of great in-
terest to the people of the United States, concerning which there can be no partisan
difference of opinion, and which ought to be passed. This is the only great nation
in the world which does not possess such an institution, and if is the one of all others
which needs it most. A national museum of living animals would be one of the
leading attractions of Washington, and would show the citizen and foreign visitor at
a glance the animals of this country as they could never be seen otherwise. By all
means let this country have aNational ‘Zoo.’ Senator Beck’s bill ought to pass.”
The Pittsburgh Dispatch declares that the bill “should meet with the hearty in-
dorsement it deserves. That a nation so far in advance in the march of progress as
the United States should be entirely without some such institution under Goy-
ernment protection seems almost incredible.” The Ncw York Forest and Stream
asserts that ‘‘ the importance of preserving living North American mammals can
hardly be overestimated. The buffalo is practically extinct, and the range of the
. elk has become so contracted in the last few years that it is apparent the same
fate awaits that noble species. There are others that will survive longer, but the
people at large know nothing, and never can know, about them, unless they shall be
brought close to their homes. All these animals should be secured before it is too
late.” The Chicago Inter-Ocean, in a lengthy and very earnest editorial on this sub-
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Smithsonian stands here in the position of a disinterested and
independent party, absolutely responsible, having a permanency such
as no individual or private corporation can represent, and it might very
well, if seems to me, in pursuit of its proper objects accept a trust of
this kind on the condition either of seeing itself that the Government
accepted it and provided for it in a proper way or handing it back to the
heirs of the conditional donor. It is perhaps not too much to say that
an important function of the Smithsonian which has lain long in whey-
ance may yet be developed in this direction.

Assignment of rooms for scientific work.—During the past year the use
of rooms in the Smithsonian building has been granted to the Director
of the Geological Survey for draughtsmen ; to the Coast and Geodetic
Survey for pendulum experiments under the direction of Assistant C. 8S.
Peirce; to the Fish Commission, during the commissionership of Dr.
Goode for the sessions of a committee for revising the work and organi-
zation of the Commission, and for the storage of the stereotype plates of
its publications.

Rooms and facilities for work have also been granted to Dr. J. F.
Bransford, surgeon, U. 8. Navy, for the preparation of a report on the

ject, dwells with special emphasis on the fact that ‘if the Government purchases
and fits up a park or extensive gardens there will not be the slightest difficulty in ob-
taining suitable inhabitants. No better illustration need be cited than the menagerie
at the Smithsonian. Nearly all the really valuable animals there have been pre-
sented to it. The zoo in London, the gardens in Paris, the parks in the cities of the
United States, not the least of which are those of Chicago, set forth, with pointed
object-lessons, the value and interest these zoological exhibitions possess. <A great
garden at the national capital could, on the plan proposed, be made one of the most
interesting and instructive of public resorts.” The Minneapolis Journal Sgys with
confidence that “inasmuch as the expense would be comparatively trifling under the
management of that object of national pride, the Smithsonian, there is every reason
to expect that the project will meet the approval of Congress.” The San Francisco
Call earnestly advocates the measure as one of interest to the entire American peo-
ple. Itsays: ‘‘That such a park would be of advantage ‘for the advancement of
science and the instruction and the recreation of the people’ needs no demonstration,
It would be a national benefit, as similar gardens have proved themselves to be in
other countries. But there are peculiar reasons for establishing an American zoo.
The original wild animals of this country are being rapidly exterminated. The
American bison, better known as the buffalo, is almost extinct. There are a few ina
remote corner of ‘'exas, and afew still survive in the Yellowstone Park. But if
nothing is done to preserve them, in a few years they will have disappeared as com-
pletely as the pterodactyl. A few moose can still be found in northern New York
and Maine; there are still a few specimens of the mountain sheep and goat in the
mountains of Colorado; an occasional caribou is stil] shot in the Adirondacks; aherd
of antelope is still seen, once in the way, on the prairies; a few grizzlies survive in
the Rocky Mountains, b ut hunters know to their sorrow that these creatures, once so
plentiful, are growing scarcer every year, and will soon have vanished altogether.
The traveler on the eastern slopes of the Rockies finds plenty of beaver dams, but few
beavers, and the mountain lion is almost « thing of the past. To find a complete
collection of the wild beasts which once roamed in freedom over the mountain slopes
and the prairies one must now go to the northern section of the Dominion of Canada,

- Toner Lecture. Fund.—The Secretary of the Institution is ex-officio
chairman of the board of trustees. No lectures have been delivered
for several years. The fund remains as originally invested, increased
annually by the unexpended income. It consists partly in real estate
in Washington, 4nd partly in Government bonds, the estimated value
of which is about $3,000.

American Historical Association.—A. bill was introduced in the Senate
by Hon. G. I’. Hoar on the 21st of May, 1888, and in the House on the
4th of June by Hon. James Phelan, to incorporate the ‘American His-
torical Association,” and as the bill proposes an intimate connection
between the association and the Smithsonian Institution it is here given
in full:

[A BILL to incorporate the American Historical Association. ]

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That Andrew D. White, of
Ithaca, in the State of New York; George Bancroft, of Washington, in
the District of Columbia; Justin Winsor, of Cambridge, in the State of
Massachusetts; William F. Poole, of Chicago, in the State of Illinois;
Herbert B. Adams, of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland; Clarence W.
Bowen, of Brooklyn, in the State of New York, their associates and suc-
cessors, are hereby created a body corporate and politic, by the name of
the American [listorical Association, for the promotion of historical
studies, the collection and preservation of historical manuscripts, and
for kindred purposes in the interest of American history and of history
in America. Said association is authorized to hold real and personal
estate to an amount not exceeding five hundred thousand dollars, to
adopt a constitution, and to make by-laws. Said association shall have
its headquarters at Washington, in the District of Columbia, and shall
hold its annual meetings in such places as the said incorporators shall
determine. Said association shall report annually to the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution concerning its proceedings and the condi-
tion of historical study in America. Said Secretary shall communicate
to Congress the whole of sueh reports, or such portion thereof as he
shall see fit. The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are authorized
to permit said association to deposit its collections, manuscripts, books,
pamphlets, and other material for history in the Smithsonian Institution
or in the National Museum, at their discretion, upon such conditions
and under such rules as they shall prescribe.

Highth centenary of the University of Bologna.—In accordance with the
request of Prof. J. Capellini, rector of the University of Bologna, the
Smithsonian Institution appointed two representatives to be present at
the eighth centenary of the university, which occurred on the 12th of
June, 1888. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, and Dr. C, Gardini,
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

United States consul at Bologna, were appointed. A letter from Doce-
tor Mitchell is herewith appended:

To the REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION:

GENTLEMEN: As representing the Institution over which you preside
I went to Bologna, and was present at the eight hundredth anniversary
of its famous university. The ceremonies consisted in addresses and a
poem by Professor Carducci, with presentations to the King and Queen,
and with the conferring of degrees in law, letters, science, and med-
icine. Mr, James Russell Lowell was thus honored in letters, Mr. David
Dudley Field in law, Alexander Agassiz in science, and myself in med-
icine. The ‘ Laureati” were not given LL.D.’s but were made doctors
in their respective branches; amore sensible plan. I shall send a medal
and the volumes presented to me, that of these you may make such dis-
posal as seem best.

And I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
WEIR MITCHELL.

Grants and subscriptions.—In accordance with a precedent established
by the first Secretary to encourage meritorious scientific enterprises
undertaken wholly for the advance of knowledge and not for pecuniary
gain, a subscription of twenty copies was made for the Astronomical
Journal of Dr. B. A. Gould, published at Boston.

Privilege of floor of the House of Kepresentatives.—A resolution having
been introduced in the House of Representatives ou the 6th of February,
1858, to admit to the privileges of the floor certain officials of the Goy-
ernment, Hon. Mr. Cox, of New York, one of the Regents, introduced a
resolution, which was referred to the Committee on Rules, to confer the
privilege on the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

It is proper to state that for many years this privilege has been ex-
tended to the Secretary by the Senate of the United States.

Reception.—It was the habit of the first Secretary, when he resided in
the Smithsonian building, to give receptions there from time to time,
which many still pleasantly remember. It is, perhaps, proper for the
writer to mention that though these rooms are now devoted to official pur-
poses he, desiring that the traditions of this kindly hospitality should
not entirely lapse, used them on the 17th of April of the present year
on an occasion, which, so far as he was able to make it so, was not dis-
similar in kind to the former ones in the same place, and which he has
reason to hope will be pleasantly associated with them in the recollec-
tions of old friends of the Institution.

Employés of the Institution—Few changes have occurred in the cleri-
cal force. Owing to the independence of the Smithsonian Institution of
those alterations which take place with changes of administration in
Government Departments, the tenure of office of all its employés is
_ Justly regarded as more secure than in other public establishments ;
and acceptable persons are commonly found willing to take employment
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

under the Regents on lower terms than the same nominal service is
elsewhere paid for by the Government. At the same time with this
fixity of tenure and permanence of position, closer and perhaps kindlier
relations are found to arise than exist else where in the midst of frequent
change; and the writer is happy to believe that the best and most val-
uable part of this service is often an unbought and voluntary one, and
that this is recognized by both employer and employed.

U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The relations of the Museum to the Smithsonian Institution have so
frequently been discussed, that itis unnecessary to dwell upon them at
the present time. The connection of the Museum with the present
establishment has not only always been very much more intimate than
that of many of the other undertakings which were projected at the time
of the foundation of the Institution, but as has already been observed,
it rests on a radically distinct footing from any other, since the Smith-
sonian Institution has actual property in the Museum, equalling probably
its whole original fund. Through the agency of the Museum the Insti-
tution is able to direct the work of a goodly number of investigators, who,
in addition to their regular administrative work, are doing each year im.
portant service in the increase and diffusion of knowledge. In fact so
much is done in the name of the Institution by the officers of the Museum
and the Bureau of Ethnology in all the fields of biological, anthropologi-
cal, and geological work, that the Institution can devote a larger pro-
portion of its own funds tothe encouragement of investigation in phys-
ical sciences than it could were not the biological sciences thus well
provided for.

The statement of the work of the year in the Museum some years
since became so great in extent that it was found necessary to add a
second volume to the Smithsonian Report to contain it. Referring then
to the report of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the assistant secretary in charge
of the Museum, for a history of the work as performed in its various
departments, I need here refer only to some of the most important gen-
eral considerations.

Prominent among these are the financial relations of the Museum to
the Smithsonian and to the General Government, and the changes ob-
tained by legislation in the past year, with regard to placing the appro-
priations more immediately under the care of the Regents, but these I
have already spoken of under the head of “‘ Finance.”

During the past year a committee appointed by me to investigate the
Sanitary condition of the present Museum structure, has reported in
urgent terms on the need in the interest of health, of very great changes
such as can not be undertaken till another building exists to receive
the present personnel, the collections, and the public during the changes,

H. Mis. 142 4

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Through the agency of one of your body this is likely to be provided,
The particulars have already been stated under the subject of “Building.”

I may add in this connection that the present Museum building is
not more than large enough for the ethnological and technological
material already available. The proposed new building will afford ac-
cominodation for the natural history collections which are at present
very inadequately housed. Tor instance, the amount of space assigned
to the collection of mammalsis about 6,500 feet. At least double that
amount of space will be needed to accommodate the material now on
hand, as soon as the taxidermists of the Museum shall have been able
to prepare it for exhibition, it being our desire to have mounted groups,
similar to the buffalo family recently finished, in order to preserve for
future generations representations of the Jarge quadrupeds native to
this continent, which are on the verge of extinction.

At the close of the last fiscal year (June 30, 1887), a very careful esti-
mate showed that the collections were about fifteen times as great in
number of specimens as in the year 1882. I desire to call your attention
especially to the inclosed statement bearing upon this point.

The Museum is growing, as it is fitting that the National Museum of
a great country should grow; and it is not only necessary to care for
what is already here, but to provide for the reception and display of
what is certain to be placed in vur hands within the next few years.

Since the erection of the present Museum building there have been
more than 12,000 groups or lots of specimens added to the collection,
chiefly by gifts. From the year 1859 to 1880 the accessions numbered
8,475. It is thus evident that within the last eight years the number
of accessions has been half as large again as during the previous twenty-
one.

Many of the more recent accessions are of very great extent, as for
instance the bequest of the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, which con
tains 20,000 specimens of shells, besides minerals and other objects ;
the Jeffreys collection of fossil and recent shells of EKurope, including
40,000 specimens; the Stearns collections of mollusks, numbering 100,000
specimens; the Riley collection of insects, containing 150,000 specimens;
the Catlin collection of Indian paintings, about 500 in number; the col-
lection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transpor-
tation of which to Washington several freight-cars were required.

There are also the extensive collections obtained at the Fisheries
Exhibition at Berlin and London and at the close of the New Orleans
Cotton Centennial; the Shepard collection of meteorites; the Wilson
collection of archeological objects (more than 12,0,0 specimens); the
Lorrillard collection of Central American antiquities, and very many
others nearly as extensive. In addition to these are the annual accre-
tions from the work of the U.S. Fish Commission, the U.S. Geological
Survey, and the Bureau of Ethnology, as well as the contributions from
several expeditions of the Government, from Army and Navy officers,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

and from other Government officials. These are very extensive, and
are yearly increasing in bulk and value.

In the Armory building are stored many hundreds of boxes of valu-
able material which we have not room to unpack, and the great vaults
under the Smithsonian building and many of the attic and tower rooms
are Similarly occupied.

For several important departments of the Museum no exhibition
space whatever is available, and no portion of the collection can be
publicly displayed. Indeed, the growth of many of the departments is
in large measure prevented by the fact that we have no room for addi-
tional exhibition cases, or even for storage. Many valuable collections
elsewhere than in Washington are at the service of the Museum, but
we have no space for their reception.

The collection of birds, which, so far as North America is concerned,
is the finest in the world, is very inadequately shown, and requires
double the case room now available.

The collection of mollusks, which is one of the most complete in the
world and contains more than 450,000 specimens, is at present almost
entirely unprovided for.

The collection of insects, which, though smaller, is, so far as North
America is concerned, equally perfect, is also practically without any
exhibition space. And so I might continue.

It should be borne in mind that under the roofs of the Smithsonian
and new Museum buildings are grouped together collections which in
London, Paris, or any other of the Kuropean capitals, are provided for
in a group of museums, for the accommodation of which a much larger
number of equally commodious buildings is found needful.

One of the most striking features in connection with the affairs of
the Museum is the remarkable increase in the extent of its collections,
which each year becomes greater. This increase is in a large degree
spontaneous, only a very small sum of money being available for the
purchase of new material. As might be supposed, a considerable pro-
portion of the objects given duplicate material already on hand, and
although these contributions can, with the utmost advantage, be used
for distribution to other museums and schools, they do not increase as
much as is desired the value of the collections for study by specialists,
and for general educational purposes. The need of a larger fund for
the purchase of specimens is yearly more manifest. Exceedingly im-
portant material is constantly offered to us at prices very much below
what it would cost to obtain it by collecting, and in many instances,
when refused, it is eagerly taken by the museums and institutions of
Europe. The extent and character of the recent additions to the collec-
tions may, perhaps, be better shown by the appended table than in any
other way. This table shows comparatively the results of a census of
the collections, taken for the past six years, and from it appears that
the number of specimens or of lots of specimens on hand at the close of
52

the year is more than 2,800,000. These figures are in many instances
estimated, and are always subject to revision.

increased before the publication of the Museum report for the year, in
which a complete tabulated statement will be given.

The registrar states that 12,400 boxes and packages were received
during the year and entered upon the transportation records of the
Smithsonian Institution. In this number are included 1,482 ‘accession
lots” for the Museum.

Many valuable contributions have been made, as in past years, through
the friendly co-operation of the Departments and Bureaus of the Gov-
ernment and of officers of the Army and Navy. For this assistance the
sincere thanks of the Museum are tendered. The geographical index
to the “list of accessions,” which will be published in the report of the
assistant secretary in charge of the Museum, will show the sources of
the material received during the year. Among the most important
accessions are the following: A collection of old coins, chiefly Roman,
deposited by Mr. Thomas Wilson; a collection of archzological and
ethnographical specimens bequeathed to the Museum by Dr. Charles
Rau; the Lea collection of shells and minerals presented during Pro-
fessor Baird’s life-time, but not received until this year; ethnological]
objects from Egypt, presented by Dr. James Grant Bey, and from the
Congo region, by Lieut. H. H. Taunt, U.S. Navy; a collection of birds from
Central America and islands in the Caribbean Sea, collected by Mr.
Charles H. Townsend; a pair of living buffaloes presented by Mr. KH. G.
Blackford ; a skin of an unusually large moose, purchased from Mr. A.
B. Douglas; the first cast made in the mold taken from the living face
of Abraham Lincoln, by Leonard Volk, in 1860; also the first casts
made in the molds from Lincoln’s hands, and the first bronze cast of
the face mold, and bronze casts of the hands presented to the Govern-
ment of the United States, for deposit in the Museum, by thirty-three
subscribers, through a committee composed of Thomas B. Clarke, Au-
gustus St. Gaudens, Richard Watson Gilder, and Erwin Davis; Indian
pottery from the pueblos of the Jemez Valley, in New Mexico, collected
by Col. James Stevenson, of the Bureau of Ethnology; a collection of
bird eges from Lieut. H.C. Benson, U.S. Army, and from Dr. J.C. Mer-
rill, U.S. Army ; a collection of reptiles and batrachians from Dr. R. Ells-
worth Call; extensive collections of fishes and marine invertebrates,
collected by the U.S. Fish Commission ; a large collection of Syrphida
from Dr. S. W. Williston, forming the types of Bulletin 31 of the Na-
tional Museum ; a valuable series of paleozoic fossils from the New
York State Museum of Natural History; a series of fossil plants, sev-
eral of them new to science, from the coal-measures of Alabama, pre-
sented by Prof. I. C. Russell, of the U.S. Geological Survey; a large
collection of eruptive, metamorphie, and sedimentary rocks from Colo-
rado, collected by Dr. S. I’. Emmons, of the U.S. Geological Survey ; an
extensive series of rocks, collected by Mr. G. P. Merrill in New Jersey,
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine; a very interesting series of
aluminum bronzes and other rare alloys, made by Bierman, of Hanover,
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and presented by the ‘Iron Age,” of New York City. Some objects of
value have also been added to other sections and departments of the
Museum, especially to those of Transportation and Graphic Arts. These
will be enumerated in the “list of accessious” already referred to.

A collection intended to illustrate the application of photography to
scientific purposes is now being prepared by Mr. T. W. Smillie for exhi-
bition at the Cincinnati Exposition. This collection includes interest-
ing contributions from Prof. H.C. Pickering, of Harvard University ;
U.S. Magnetic Station, U. 8. Coast Survey, Army Medical Museum, U.
S. Light-House Board, U.S. Signal Office, the proving ground at An-
napolis, Commander CO. I. Goodrich, U.S. Navy; Mr. J. W. Osborne, and
Dr. Thomas Taylor, of the Department of Agriculture.

The increasing popularity of the Museum seems to be proved by the
fact that during the year the number of visitors to the Museum Build-
ing was 249,025, or 52,465 more than last year, and the number of visit-
ors to the Smithsonian Building was 103,442, or 4,891 more than last
year.

Following the usual policy, free access to the collections has been
granted to students in the various branches of natural history, and in
many instances specimens have been lent to specialists for comparison
and study. Instruction in taxidermy and photography have been given
to several applicants. This has in some instances been done at the re-
quest of an executive department; otherwise, the students have been
expected to render voluntary service as an equivalent. Permission has
been granted by the Superintendent of Police, upon the indorsement of
the Smithsonian Institution, to several young men to shoot birds in the
District of Columbia for scientific purposes. This privilege is provided
for by law in section 14, chapter 213, vol. I of the ‘‘ Supplement to the Re-
vised Statutes of the United States.” The use of the lecture hall in the
Mnseum has been granted for lectures and meetings of scientific socie-
ties, as follows: A course of Saturday lectures, twelve in number, com-
mencing on February 18; four lectures given under the auspices of the
Amateur Botanical Club of Washington, on December 10, 21, January
7, 21; the annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, April
17-21. The Biological Society of Washington and the Botanical Sec-
tion of this society also held some of their meetings in the Museum.
The usual courtesies have been extended to other public institutions
by the gift and joan of photographs and working drawings of Museum
cases, drawings and photographs of specimens, and copies of Museum
labels. |

Two hundred and sixty-four lots of specimens have been distributed
to museums, colleges, and individuals. Applications for duplicate spec.
imens are each year increasing innumber. During this year fifty-three
have been received. It has always been the policy of the Smithsonian
Institution to distribute in this way the duplicate material which accu-
mulates in the departments of the Museum, and the importance of this
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

policy has been repeatedly commented upon in previous reports. It
has not yet, however, been found practicable to comply with these
applications as fast as received, because the curators have not yet had
time to arrange the duplicate material into sets for distribution. It is
to be hoped that in future it may be possible to relieve the curators of
some of the routine work which they are now obliged to attend to per-
sonally, in order that among other things they may devote more of their
time to the classification of duplicate material.

The importance of museum collections for purposes of education in
schools is becoming of late years much more fully appreciated, and it
seems desirable to make some changes in the manner of distributing
specimens; especially to make the collections sent out so complete—
within such limits as it may be possible to develop them by methods of
arrangement and labels—that they may be ready for immediate use in
instruction. In order to do this it is often necessary to supplement du-
plicate material on hand by other material specially collected. With
this in view the curators of mineralogy and physical geology have been
requested to obtain during the year in large quantities, for the special
purpose of distribution, specimens of minerals from certain rich locali-
ties. By this means material for a considerable number of series of
minerals and rocks have been obtained, while at the same time valua-
ble additions have been made to the Museum collections. Mr. Merrill,
curator of physical geology, visited during the summer, points in North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Ver-
mont, and New York. Mr. Yeates, assistant curator of minerals, vis-
ited the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and North
Carolina. Special attention has been thus given to obtaining geologi-
cal and mineralogical material for distribution, owing to the fact that
there is on file a very large number of applications for specimens of
this kind, which it has been impossible so far to meet. Collections of
this character are, furthermore, much better suited for school museums,
especially those which have not much money to spend in the prepara-
tion and installation of specimens, than are the more fragile and perish-
able zodlo gical collections. It is hoped that during the coming year it
will also be practical to make up a considerable number of sets of bird-
skins, illustrating the classification of birds into families.

The report on the operations of the National Museum for the first
half of 1885, and forming Part 11 of the Report of the Smithsonian In-
Stitution, has been received from the Public Printer. This report in-
cludes Mr. Thomas Donaldson’s paper on ‘‘The George Catlin Indian
Gallery.” The bound volumes of volume 9 of the *“‘ Proceedings of the
U.S. National Museum” were received from the Public Printer in Au-
gust. Two hundred copies of this volume had been distributed, signa-
ture by signature,to the collaborators ef the Museum and other scientists
throughout the world. This volume consists of 720 pages, and is illus-

trated by twenty-five plates and six figures. It includes fifty-five papers
by Messrs. Ridgway, Rathbun, Stejneger, Dall, True, and other officers
of the Museum, and by Messrs. Jordan, Higenmann, Hvermann, Law-
rence, and other collaborators. Six new genera and fifty-one new species
of animals are described for the first time in this volume. Signatures
7-31 of volume 10 of the ‘ Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum,”
were printed and distributed. These include 400 pages, and embrace
thirty-three papers by Messrs. Bean, Bollman, Cope, Higenmann, C. H.
Gilbert, Lilljjeborg, Linton, Lucas, McNeill, Rathbun, Ridgway, R. W.
Shufeldt, J. B. Smith, Stejneger, Townsend, and Vasey. In these sig-
natures are contained descriptions of fifty-one new genera and species
of birds, mammals, reptiles, fishes, and insects. Bulletin 32, “ Cata-
logue of Batrachians and Reptiles of Central America and Mexico,”
by Ii. D. Cope, has been issued. Considerable progress has been made
in the printing of Bulletin 33, ‘Catalogue of Minerals,” by Thomas
Kgleston, and of Bulletin 34, “ Batrachia of North America,” by E. D.
Cope.

The Museum report for 188788 is now being prepared, and will in-
clude literary contributions from Dr. H. C. Yarrow, Prof. Otis T. Ma-
son, Mr. F. A. Lucas, and others.

Jireular 36, ‘‘Concerning the Department of Antiquities,” was printed
and widely distributed by the curator of that department. A large
correspondence has resulted, and valuable facts have been collated there-
from. These will be published in the report of the curator.

Nearly 250 papers have been published by the officers of Museum
and about 50 by collaborators. In the latter case the papers are
based upon material inthe Museum. Of the entire number, 79 relate
to insects, 70 to birds, 12 to reptiles, 11 to fossil invertebrates, 9 to min-
erals, and 8 to plants.

The number of labels printed for the Museum during the year is
2,600. In addition, copy for more than 2,000 labels was sent to the
Government Printing Office, but the labels had not been printed at the
end of the fiscal year. It is hoped that next year it may be possible
to secure quicker returns of labels from the Printing Office, since upon
them depends in great part the instructive value of the objects exhib-
ited. ;

The number of publications added to the Library during the year
is 6,063, of which 1,316 are volumes of more than a hundred pages.
The most important accession was the bequest of Dr. Charles Raw’s
library, consisting of 715 volumes and 1,722 pamphlets and other docu-
ments.

Through the co-operation of the U. 8S. Fish Commission the Smith-
sonian Institution has been enabled to secure from Funk Island, for
the National Museum, a coliection of bones of the Great Auk, and in-
cidentally important collections of mammals, birds, bird eggs, fishes,
plants, ores, rocks, stone implements, and fossils were obtained from

Newfoundland, Magdalen Islands, and adjacent islands. An account of
this expedition will be given in a paper by Mr, T°. A. Lucas in Part Il
of the Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1858.

The collection of the department of Ethnology has: been enriched
by the receipt of a most valuable and interesting contribution of
specimens brought from Easter Island, and also of a series of photo-
graphs taken on the island by Paymaster William J. Thomson, U.S.
Navy.

Mr. W. T. Hornaday, curator of living animals, made a collecting
trip to the Northwest in November and secured a large number of living
animals.

Under the joint auspices of the Fish Commission and Smithsonian
Institution Mr. Charles H. Townsend made a collecting tour on Swan
Island and in Central America. Asa result large collections of mam-
mals and birds were obtained for the Museum.

During the summer Mr. IF. H. Knowiton made a collection of the
plants, rocks, and ores of Vermont.

During the year important changes have taken place in connection
with some of the scientific departments of the Museum. Dr. Charles
Rau, Curator of the Department of Prehistoric Anthropology, died on
June 26,1887.* His successor is Mr. Thomas Wilson, who received his
appointment as Honorary Curator on December 1. In November Dr. H.
G. Beyer, U.S. Navy, Honorary Curator of the Section of Materia Medica,
was ordered to other duties, and Dr. J. M. Flint, U.S. Navy, the first Cura-
tor of this collection, has again taken charge. The Museum has com-
menced the formation of a collection of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian
antiquities, in association with the Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Paul
Haupt, Professor of Semitic Languages in the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, was in February appointed Honorary Curator, Dr. Cyrus Adler, of
the same university, consenting to act as Honorary Assistant Curator.
The Section of Transportation, under the care of Mr. J. &. Watkins, has
now reached that point in its history where it may take rank with the
other sections of the Department of Arts and Industries. The Section
of Graphic Arts, under the curatorship of Mr. S. R. Koehler, has made
excellent progress toward the illustration of the resources of the art of
engraving in all its branches. On May 9 the Department of Living
Animals was organized, with Mr. W. T. Hornaday, Chief Taxidermist, as
curator.

As in years past, we have been called upon to contribute to local ex
hibitions, and numerous applications have been. made for material,
which has always been refused on the ground that nothing could be done
without an order from Congress. Numerous bills of this kind have been
before Congress for consideration. Oneof these, passed during the fiscal
year of 1887, applied to the present year. This was the bill authorizing

the sending of collections to Minneapolis. The joint resolution, which
was approved March 3, 1887, is here quoted:

[Public resolution No. 18.]

JOINT RESOLUTION authorizing the several Executive Departments of the Govern-
ment to loan to the Minneapolis Industrial Exposition certain articles for exhibit.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled, That it is desirable, in any way con-
sistent with existing laws, and without risk to Government property
or expense to the National Treasury, to encourage the effort being
made for the opening and holding of a grand industrial and educational
exposition of the Northwest, at the city of Minneapolis, in the State of
Minnesota, and the interests of the whole northwestern section of our
country demand it be made an unqualified success; and it be, and is
hereby, approved that the heads of the several Executive Departments
shall, in whatever respects they may in their judgment see convenient
and proper, loan any articles or material suitable to such purpose:
Provided, That such loan be made entirely on the responsibility of said
Minneapolis Industrial Exposition, and shall not be of material needed
for use in either Department, and shall not in any way interrupt the
daily routine of duty or order in any branch of the Government, and
shall be returned to the proper Department, in good order, within one
month after the close of the exposition: And provided further, That
before any such loan shall be made, the proper head of the Department
shall require and receive a good and sufficient bond, by or in behalf of
such exposition, for the safe return thereof as aforesaid, and to indem-
nify and save harmless the Government of the United States, or any
Department thereof, from any liability or expense on account thereof,
or on account of this resolution.

Approved, March 3, 1887.

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution was prepared under the
direction of Mr. W. V. Cox, Chief Clerk of the National Museum, who
was appointed representative of the Institution on this occasion. The
exhibit may be classified under the following heads: Ethnology, Tex-
tiles and Fabrics, Metallurgy, Deer Antlers and Horns, Casts of Fishes
of North America, Photographs of Government Buildings, including the
Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, collection of specimens
illustrating the composition of the human body. The total weight of
this exhibit was 21,507 pounds. The entire Government exhibit at-
tracted much attention, and repeated requests were made by the man-
agers of the exposition for the privilege of keeping the articles for
another exhibition. :

A much more extensive enterprise was the Ohio Valley and Central
States Exposition at Cincinnati, opening July 4, 1888, which, together
with an exhibition at Marietta on July 15 to July 19, was made the sub-
ject of a bill which, having passed both Houses, was approved May 28,
1888. <A copy of the act approved May 28, and of the explanatory act
approved July 16, is here given.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

AN ACT making an appropriation to enable the several Executive Departments of
the Government and the Bureau of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution,
including the National Museum and Commiission of Fish and Fisheries, to partici-
pate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, to be held
at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth to October twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred
and eighty-eight.

Whereas the States which comprise the Northwest Territory and the
adjacent States will hold at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth to Octo-
ber twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, a centennial
exposition commemorative of the organization of the Northwest Terri-
tory, under the ordinance of seventeen hundred and eighty-seven, in
which exposition all the States and Territories of the United States and
the General Government have been invited to participate, the object
being in said exposition to present a panorama of the nation’s resources
and present state of progressive development by an exhibition of the
products of agriculture, of the various industries and fine arts; also the
results of advancement made in the sciences ; the whole illustrating the
opportunities secured to and the possibilities which wait upon the citi-
zens of this Republic; and

Whereas the citizens of the Ohio Valley and the several States adja-
cent thereto have made suitable and adequate preparation and arrange-
ments for holding said exposition, and are desirous—and it being fif and
proper—that the several Execntive Departments of the Government,
the Department of Agriculture, the Smithsonian Institution, including
the National Museum and Commission of Fish and Fisheries, should
participate in said exhibition: Therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the head of each of the
several Executive Departments of the Government, the Commissioner of
Agriculture, and the Smithsonian Institution, including the National
Museum and Commission of Fish and Fisheries, under the direction of
the President of the United States, be, and they are hereby, authorized
and directed to prepare and make suitable exhibits at the said Centen-
nial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, to be held at
Cincinnati, beginning on the fourth of July and closing October twenty-
seventh, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight.

That there shall be appointed a committee of Congress composed of
ten members, five to be appointed by the President of the Senate and
five by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Said committee
is authorized and directed to visit said exposition and make such report
to Congress in that behalf as they may deem needful and proper: Pro-
vided, That the President may in the exercise of his discretion allow
such documents, and exhibits as relate to early settlement at Marietta,
Ohio, and the establishment of civil government in the territory north-
west of the Ohio River, to be taken to Marietta, and exhibited during
the time from July fifteenth to nineteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-
eight, inclusive, under such restrictions and custody as he may direct.

That to enable the several Executive Departments of the Government,
the Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution, in-
cluding the National Museum and the Commission of Fish and Fish-
eries, to participate in said exposition, to be held as aforesaid, there is
hereby appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise
appropriated, one hundred and forty-seven thousand seven hundred and
fifty dollars, apportioned as follows :

For the War Department, seven thousand one hundred and fifty dol-
lars.

For the Navy Department, fifteen thousand dollars,

jars.

For the Department of Agriculture, twenty thousand dollars.

For the Post-Office Department, five thousand dollars.

For the Department of Justice, two thousand dollars.

For the Smithsonian Institution, including the Commission of Fish
and Fisheries, fifty thousand dollars.

For expenses of the committee of Congress, two thousand five hun-
dred dollars.

That the President may, if in his judgment it shall be deemed neces-
sary and expedient in order to secure the best results with greatest
economy, transfer a part of the fund hereby apportioned to one Depart-
ment or Bureau to another Department or Bureau. Theterm Bureau
wherever used herein shall be construed to include the Agricultural
Department, the Smithsonian Institution, and Commission of Fish and
Fisheries.

That the President of the United States is hereby authorized to de-
tail an officer of the pay department of the Army or Navy to disburse
the fund appropriated by this act.

The payments on account of expenses incurred in carrying out and
into effect the provisions hereof shall be made on itemized vouchers ap-
proved by the representative of the Department incurring the liability,
and a person to be designated by the President to make final audit of
said accounts: Provided, That payment of the expenses incurred by the
committee of Congress shall be made on vouchers approved by the
chairman of said e¢ommittee.

That the head of each of said Executive Departments and of the De-
partment of Agriculture, Smithsonian Institution, and Commission of
Fish and Fisheries shall, from among the officers or employees thereof,
appoint a suitable person to act as representative of such Department
or Bureau, and said representative shall, under the direction and con-
trol of the head of the Department or Bureau, supervise the preparation
and conduct of the exhibits herein provided for.

That no officer or employee appointed as aforesaid shall be paid extra
or additional compensation by reason of services rendered in virtue of
such employment; but nothing herein shall be so construed as to pre-
vent the payment of the just and reasonable expenses of any commit-
tee, officer, or employee appointed or employed under and by virtue of
the provisions of this act.

ion of Canada for the purpose of being exhibited at said exposition
shall be admitted free of duty, subject, however, to such conditions and
regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may impose and prescribe.

Approved, May 28, 1888.

JOINT RESOLUTION declaring the true intent and meaning of the act approved
May twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled, That it is the true intent and meaning
of the act of Congress approved May twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred
and eighty-eight, by the President of the United States, entitled “An
act making appropriation to enable the several Executive Departments
of the Government, and the Bureauof Agriculture, and the Smithsonian

Institution, including the National Museum and the Commission of Fish
and Fisheries, to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio
Valley and Central States, to be held at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July
fourth to October seventh, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight,” that
the President of the United States may, in his discretion make an order
directing that any documents, papers, maps not original, books or other
exhibits which properly and pertinently relate to the establishment of
civil government in the territory northwest of the Ohio River, may be
sent upon an executive order from any of the several Departments in
said act named, or from the exhibits now at Cincinnati, and that the
appropriation of money in said act to defray the expenses of such ex-
hibits, may be made applicable, inso far as the President of the United
States may direct, to the payment of the expenses of the care, trans-
portation to and return of such exhibits from Marietta. And the same
shall be paid from such fund heretofore set apart for each Department
as the President may order. Nor shall anything in said act be so con-
strued as to prevent the purchase of suitable materials, and the em-

ployment of proper persons, to complete or modify series of objects, and
classes of specimens, when in the judgment of the head of any Depart-

ment such purchase or employment, or both is necessary in the proper
preparation and conduct of an exhibit. Nor to authorize the removal
from their places of deposit in Washington of any original paper or
document or laws or ordinances whatever.

Approved, July 16, 1888.

The Assistant Secretary, Dr. Goode, was appointed representative of
the Smithsonian Institution in the preparation of this display, in ac-
cordance with the provisions of the act. Preparations for these exhi-
bitions were nearly completed at the close of the fiscal year, and some
fourteen car-loads of material have been sent by this Institution to
Cincinnati. The sum of $50,000 was appropriated for the use of the
Smithsonian Institution (including the National Museum and Fish
Commission), and $10,000 of this sum was transferred to the Commis-
sioner of Fisheries.

In this connection it may be well to say that, although sympathizing
with the effort to extend the educational work of the Institution and of
the National Museum throughout the country, the growing tendency to
withdraw for a considerable portion of each year some of the most in-
teresting and valuable parts of the collections, is liable to many objec-
tions,—objections which are much stronger now, since the Museum is
approaching a final arrangement in classification than some years ago,
when the collections were unsettled and unformed. Not only is the
work of the entire Museum seriously impaired, but the collections sent
out are invariably damaged, sume irreparably, some to such a degree
that it requires much time and expense to restore them. Furthermore,
the standard of local exhibitions is yearly becoming higher, and the
local managers are no longer satisfied to accept from us the specimens
which, in the judgment of the Museum officials, can be spared, but are
disposed to insist upon having the most valuable and costly objects,
which if destroyed would be irreplaceable, and if sent at all are espe-
cially liable to damage. In addition to this should be taken into account
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the fact that temporary exposition buildings are never fire-proof, and
that the time is sure to come, if the present practice prevails, when some
exhibition building containing Government collections, to the value of
hundreds of thousands of dollars, will be destroyed. The experience
of the Mexican Government in its participation at the New Crleans
Exposition and of the Government of New South Wales in 1883 may
be taken as warnings. If, however, in future years Congress is dis-
posed to order such participation in exhibitions, I would urge as a ne-
cessity that legislation should be provided at least six months in ad-
vance of the date of the exhibition; otherwise, the participation can
not but be unsatisfactory and expensive. I am also disposed to lay
stress upon the necessity of liberal appropriations, which should be
made with the understanding that new material may be obtained, which
shall not only replace that which has been lost in past exhibitions, but
shall enrich the Museum collections for home use and for use in future
exhibition work. If this necessity is not recognized, the result will be
that in a few years the Museum will be greatly impoverished, not only
by the destruction of material, but also by the dissipation of the energy
of its staff, which being applied to temporary purposes in this way is
taken away from its legitimate work. It would indeed seem onty fair
that a distraction of this kind, which affects in large degree every
officer and employé, should be compensated for by the opportunity to
purchase new material which will remain permanently the property of
the Government and increase the usefulness of the Governmental
Museum work.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and in com-
pliance with acts of Congress, was continued during the year 1887~88
in charge of Maj. J. W. Powell, as oes who has furnished the fol-
lowing account of operations.

The work of the yearis most Dene ee reported upon under two
general heads of field work and office work.

FIELD WORK.

The field work of the year is divided into (1) mound explorations and
(2) general field studies, which during the year were chiefly directed to
archeology, linguistics, and pictography.

Mound explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds of the east-
ern United States was, in former years, under the superintendence of
Prof. Cyrus Thomas.

Much of his attention and that of his assistants was directed to the
preparation for the publication of his reports on the work of the mound
division during the previous years of its labors.

As the work of writing up the report from the field-notes, examining
the collections, and preparing the plats and illustrations proceeded, it
was found that here and there were omissions in the original examina-
tions which left the details of certain sections incomplete. It therefore
became necessary to close these gaps as far as possible. The most im-
portant hiatus was filled by an examination of the lake border of the
United States from Detroit westward to the head of Lake Superior, to
ascertain whether the historic Indian localities along that line were
marked by mounds or other ancient works.

Another undertaking which had been begun during the last month
of the preceding year was a survey of certain inclosures and other an-
cient remains of Ohio, to test the reliability and accuracy of the surveys
made by Squier and Davis and others. This was continued during a
portion of the past year.

A third item consisted in completing, as far as possible, the list of
mound localities to be used in preparing the maps.

During the year the assistants were Messrs. James D. Middleton,
Gerard Fowke, and Henry L. Reynolds.

On July 15 Messrs, Middleton and Fowke went to Ohio, where they were
engaged about one month in surveying the ancient works of that region.
During the same time Mr. Reynolds was employed in the same State
collecting data for the archeologic maps. From Ohio Mr. Fowke went
to Michigan, making the tour of the lake border of the United States
from Detroit westward to Duluth at the head of Lake Superior. He
made careful examinations for ancient works and aboriginal remains,
especially at the following-named points: Detroit; Port Huron; Sagi-
naw ; Ogeman County; about Traverse Bay; Beaver Island; Mackinae
Island and the main land on both sides; Sault Ste. Marie; Marquette;
Munissing; the copper region; Ontonagon; Ashland; Bayfield; La
Pointe (the Old Chaquamagon),and Duluth. Returning by way of
Prairie du Chien, Wis., and Davenport, Lowa, he stopped at Carbon-
dale, Ill., the point selected as headquarters for the season. After
writing out a preliminary report of his trip he went to Kentucky to
examine certain works in the northern part of that State, and thence
to Washington. During May and June, 1888, he was engaged in ex-
ploring mounds in Pike County, Ohio.

From Ohio Mr. Middleton went to Wisconsin to survey certain groups
of works in the southern and southwestern part of that State, which
occupied him until autumn. He then went to Carbondale where he was
engaged most of the winter in working up the plats and other results
of his surveys. Before the close of the winter he made a survey of
certain groups in southeastern Missouri and of the Seltzertown group
in Mississippi. During April, May, and June he was engaged in sur-
veying and examining groups in southern Ohio and northern Kentueky.

Mr. Reynolds, after leaving Ohio, was engaged during the remainder
of the summer, and until he went to Carbondale in autumn, collecting
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

material for maps, in Michigan and Wisconsin. He remained at Car-
bondale until the last of December.

General field studies—While engaged in making a geological recon-
naissance of the Tewan Mountains, the Director was enabled to study
on the ground a large field of archeology. This is an extensive district
of country drained by the Chama and Jemez, and other tributaries of
the Rio Grande del Norte. In prehistoric and early historic times the
region was mainly occupied by tribes of the Tewan stock. The people
lived in villages or pueblos, many of which were built of the rude stone
that abounds in convenient forms for such structures. The cliffs of the
canons carved by the many streams that drain the mountain area are
often composed of voleanic tufa so soft that it can be easily worked with
rude stone tools, and many of the people had learned to hew it into
convenient shapes for architectural purposes.

Some of the tribes at different periods in their history left their stone
pueblos and constructed homes for themselves by excavating chambers
in the tufa cliffs. These cavate dwellings, now abandoned and in ruins,
and the ruins of many other ancient dwellings, are scattered through-
out this entire country.

On the northern flank of the Tewan Mountains, near the river Chama
and about 3 miles below Abiquiu, an extensive ruin was visited, the
walls of which were constructed of clay built up ina mass. By what
mechanical devices they were built was not discovered, but it is evident
that the clay was not made into adobes. During the study of all these
ruins interesting archeologic collections were made, especially of articles
in stone and clay.

Mr. James Stevenson, who had accompanied the Director in the above-
mentioned explorations, proceeded, at the beginning of October, 1887,
to the pueblo of Silla, about 8 miles south of Jemez, and spent six weeks
engaged, with remarkable success, in making a collection and studying
the customs, sociology, and mythology of the people.

The Sillaretain their ancient religion in great purity in spite of the
efforts of Christian priests which have been continued for centuries.
Their ceremonial chambers contained brightly-colored altars of wood,
before which many idols and other sacred objects were placed, while the
walls were hung with various mythologic emblems of great delicacy and
beauty. Mr. Stevenson was invited to inspect all these freely. The
fact was disclosed that the people had a finer variety of idols than even
the Zuni. Their stone idols in human form presented a special feature,
the carving being of a higher type than any before seen in the region.

From one of the large ceremonial chambers he was passed through a
concealed opening into a much smaller room literally filled with masks
made in imitation of their idols, all of which he was permitted to examine
at leisure, a most unusual privilege, as these people have a superstitious
dread of their masks being seen when off the person. This collection of
masks is not only large but interesting in variety. Sketches were made
of many of them.
: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

The Silla, like the other pueblos, have shrines scattered around the
village near and far, which Mr. Stevenson was invited to visit and in-
spect, finding some of them guarded by colossal stone animals crudely
formed. Having unexpectedly discovered, while studying their mythol-
ogy, that these people, like the Moki, held ceremonials with living snakes,
including the rattlesnake, he asked to be shown the exact place where the
snake ceremonies were held. This proved to be 5 or 6 miles distant from
the pueblo, in a desolate spot among arid hills, where there was a small
square log structure in which the snake order held ceremonies previous
to the dance, the snakes being contained in two large pottery vases.
- The cave when found was closed and completely concealed by a stone
slab, upon the removal of which two splendid specimens of ancient vases
were disclosed, decorated with pictures of the rattlesnake, mountain lion,
and bear, and one of these vases now occupies a position in the National
Museum as a part of the collection of the past season.

This collection, consisting of 864 specimens, is in many respects the
most valuable ever secured by Mr. Stevenson, as it not only includes a
great variety of form and decoration in pottery (some of the pieces being
- very old), but it embraces the largest and most interesting collection of
idols and fetiches yet made. Many of the stone images are in human
form and different from anything possessed by the Zuni or Moki In-
dians; those of the latter being, with few exceptions, carved in wood,
while the Silla possessed a large number of well-carved stone idols in
human form. The stone animal idols are also superior to and larger
than any heretofore collected. One of the features of the collection is
the beautiful variety of plumed and other fetiches.

Mr. Stevenson made copious notes on the mythology and sociology
of the Silla, and obtained the most complete cosmogony ever secured
by him from any people.

He closed his field season with the Zuni priest-doctors, obtaining
from them additional detailed accounts of their secret medicine order.

During the months of August and September Mr. W. H. Holmes was
engaged in studying the antiquities of Jemez Valley, New Mexico.
This valley is tributary to the Rio Grande on the west, and its middle
portion is about 50 miles west of Santa Fé.

Fifteen important ruined pueblos and village sites were examined.
They correspond closely in type to those of the north, and bear evi-
dence in most cases of pre-Spanish occupation. Besides the larger
ruins there are a multitude of minor ruins, small houses and lodges of
stone, scattered through the forests. Mr. Holmes carried his investi-
gations of the ruins of Colorado and New Mexico as far south as Abi-
quiu, which village lies at the northern end of the group of mountains
in which the Rio Jemez takes its rise. His work of the year has
therefore enabled_him to connect his studies of the northern localities
with those of the south in which the numerous modern pueblos are lo-
cated. The chain of observations thus secured is of value in a study

of the art products of the vast region formerly occupied by town-build-
ing tribes.

-articular attention was given to an examination of the ceramic re-
mains. These constitute one of the means of developing the history of
the pre-Columbian inhabitants. A large series of specimens was for-
warded to the Museum.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff, with Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff as his assistant, left
Washington for the field, September 1, 1887, and returned March 18,
1888. <A group of cave lodges, excavated in the top and sides of a cin-
der cone at the base of San Francisco Mountain, and situated about 18
miles northeast of Flagstaff, Ariz., was visited and sketches and dia-
grams were made. ‘The cliff dwellings of Walnut Canon, about 12 miles
southeast of Flagstaff, were also examined.

Later the work of the field party was among the ruined pueblos near
Keams Caiion, which connect traditionally with the present Moki vil-
lages. These ruins, six in number, are distributed on the north border
of the Jeditoh Valley, and are scattered along for a distance of 12 miles.

The party afterwards camped for some time in the vicinity of Oraibe,
the largest of the present villages of Tusayan. Herea study was made
of the primitive constructional devices still in use. Two interesting
ruins were discovered in this neighborhood and their ground plans se-
cured. In the northern ruin a cave or underground apartment was
found containing vestiges of stone walls and supporting timbers. The
small village of Moen-Kopi was surveyed. This is an outlying farming
pueblo, occupied mainly during the planting and harvesting seasous.
A very extensive system of irrigation is in operation in this vicinity.

Subsequently the party spent six weeks at the Chaco ruins in New
Mexico. An accurate architectural survey of the more important ruins
was made, and the plans secured reveal many points of interest. The
degree of mechanical knowledge displayed by the builders of these
pueblos has been greatly exaggerated by earlier explorers, as also the
quality of the masonry. Close examination reveals on the part of the
builders ignorance of some of the simplest principles of construction.
Several ruins, not previously known, were surveyed and others were
visited. Late in the season the party platted the pueblo of Jemez,
situated upon a river of the same name, a tributary of the Rio Grande.

At various times during the progress of the field-work studies were
made of the more primitive Navajo architecture, and many sketches
and diagrams were prepared illustrating the Navajo system of framing
these “ hogans,” or conical wood and earth houses. Several photographs
of typical examples were taken.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff left Washington for the field September 1 and
returned February 23. In addition to general assistance to the party
under charge of Mr. Victor Mindeleff, he was in immediate charge of
the surveying. Ground plans of thirteen important ruins, in addition
to sketch plaus of a number of others of less importance, and of two
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

inhabited pueblos, were added to those already in the possession of the
Bureau. The methods of surveying followed in previous years were
continued in this. The plans, as a rule, are drawn to a seale of 20 feet
to | inch, and the drawing is finished in the field. The topography is
in all cases indicated by contour lines of 5-foot intervals, sketched upon
a basis of a number of points determined with a level. The ground plan
was usually drawn over a number of points and lines, which were located
with an instrument, and the direction of all the walls was determined
by a compass, in order to detect any irregularities. It was found that
the regularity and symmetry of plan which characterizes many pub-
lished ground plans ‘of ruins in the southwest—notably those of the
Chaco ruins—are not justified by the facts exhibited by the ruins them-
selves, though upon cursory examination, and even upon preliminary
survey, the ground plans of many of these ruins are apparently sym-
metric. The plans obtained will be publisked in articles now being
- prepared.

Mr. A. M. Stephen was engaged during half of the fiscal year in col-
lecting traditions avd other matter from the Tusayan villages and
among the Navajos. He has transmitted a number of valuable short
papers en these topics and also on the house-lore of the Moki Indians,
and has furnished descriptions and drawings of the ‘“ Kisis” or rude
temporary shelters of the Moki, comparing these with the primitive
structures of the Navajos.

The publications of Henry R. Schooleraft, issued in 1853, upon the
pictographs of the Ojibwa, give the impression that they were nearly
as far advanced in hieroglyphic writing as were the Egyptians imme-
diately before their pictorial representations had become syllabic.
Doubts had been entertained of the accuracy of this account which it
was considered to be the duty of the Bureau of Ethnology to resolve ;
therefore at the beginning of the fiscal year Col. Garrick Mallery and
Dr. W. J. Hoffman were directed to proceed to Indian reservations in
Minnesota and Wisconsin and learn whatever remained accessible on
the subject.

Dr. Hoffman proceeded to the White Earth and Red Lake Reserva-
tions, Minnesota, and remained for three months, making the required re-
searches among the Ojibwa. He found that the most important bireh-
bark records are those relating to the Ojibwa cosmogony, the institu-
tion of the Midewin or Grand Medicine Society (in which is preserved
all that pertains to the supposed sacred mission of the Shaman), and
the songs used in connection with the ritual and the initiation of candi-
dates into that society. i

The pictographie charts are, as a rule, in the possession of the Mide
or Grand Medicine Man, though records relating to hunting and per-
sonal exploits, as well as directions for killing game, gathering fruits,
and making journeys, and even personal letters, are made by other
members of the tribe who possess more than ordinary intelligence,
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The great mass of charts consist of mnemonic songs, pertaining to
incantations, exorcism, and other ceremonies, and a considerable number
of these records were obtained, together with their interpretations.
Sketches of tattooed Indians were also made, but it was learned that
this custom is almost extinct, the only modern markings being those
applied to various portions of the face for the exorcism of evil spirits
‘sausing neuralgia, headache, and other pains. Hasty sketches were
obtained also of an old Grand Medicine chart at Red Lake, a protracted
examination of it not being permitted by the keeper of the record.

In addition to the pictographic material, a quantity of mythologie
matter was collected, all or nearly all of which: was intimately con-
nected with the rites of the secret society of the Midewin, or Grand
Medicine.

Colonel Mallery directed his attention chiefly to the examination of
the Ojibwa on the La Pointe and Red Cliff Reservations in Wisconsin,
and although it is aless favorable field for ethnologic ressarch than
those mentioned in Minnesota, owing to the larger and closer intluence
of civilization, he obtained evidence complementing the observations
and conclusions of Dr. Hoffman. Asa general result it is found that
there still exists among the Ojibwa a remarkable degree of pictographic
skill and it is employed in ordinary affairs of life as well as in the serv-
ice of religion and ceremonial rites. The statements of Schoolcraft,
however, are shown to be exaggerated, or at least erroneous, especially
in their attribution of mystic symbolism to devices purely ideographic
or mnemonic, The apparently significant coloration of his figures is
deceptive, as colors are not now and probably never have been used in
the genuine records.

In August, Colonel Mallery proceeded alone to Cape Breton and _
Prince Edward Islands, Nova Scotia, and Maine, to investigate the
bark records and petroglyphs of Micmacs and the Abnaki. Special
study was made as to the probability of an aboriginal source for many
of the characters supposed to have been first used by French mission-
aries in 1652, and afterward printed at Vienna, Austria, in 1862, with
additions and changes, under the direction of Rev. Charles Kauder,
and now generally styled the “ Micmac Hieroglyphs.”

A most interesting and uuique body of rock etchings was discovered
at and near Kejimkoojic Lake, Nova Scotia, and accurate copies of
many of them were secured. On account of their number, their in-
trinsic interest and the evidences of their antiquity, these etchings
form a highly important addition to the collections before made, es-
pecially as they are in a region from which no representation of that
nature had been reported. A petroglyph of interest near Machias,
Me., not before known, was also copied. A valuable collection was for
the first time obtained of birch-bark pictographs still made or formerly
used by the Passamaquoddy and Penobseot tribes of the Abnaki in
Maine, showing a similarity in the use of picture-writing between the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

members of the extensive Algonkian stock in the regions west of the
Great Lakes and those on the northeastern sea-board. The correlation
of the pictographic practice in manner and extent was before inferen-
tially asserted, but no satisfactory evidence of it had been presented
until the researches of the present year brought into direct comparison
the pictography of the Ojibwa with that of the Miemaes and Abnaki.
Colonel Mallery returned to Washington in October.

Mr. James Mooney spent the earlier months of the fiscal year in the
examination of the northern division of Cherokees with reference to the
dialectic difference of vocabulary between them and the main body of
the same tribe in the Indian Territory from which they have long been
separated, and also, in studying for the same comparison their reli-
gious practices, traditions, social customs, and arts. The northern
Cherokees are found to have been less affected by civilization than
those of the south, and they can therefore be studied with manifest
advantage. Mr. Mooney procured a large amount of valuable material
from them.

OFFICE WORK.

Director Powell was frequently occupied during the year in the ex-
amination of undetermined problems pertaining to his work upon the
classification of the Indian linguistic stocks, the scope of which has been
explained in his former reports. It was found necessary to defer decis-
ion respecting some of the stocks until after obtaining the result of
additional field-work planned for the ensuing year.

Colonel Mallery, after his return from the field-work, was engaged in
study of important and novel points developed thereby, and in contin-
ued research and correspondence on sign language and pictography.

Dr. Hoffman, while assisting in the same work, prepared an atlas and
topograhie chart showing all the petrogylphs within the limits of the
United States and adjacent countries so far recorded in the archives of
the Bureau, and all particulars of manipulation, coloration, position,
and other characteristics of interest, with descriptions and references
to authorities.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw was chiefly employed in a solution of problems
relating to the geographic distribution of the linguistic families of North
American Indians in the territory north of Mexico. When not engaged
in this work or with executive duties he continued the preparation of a
dictionary in the nature of a synonomy of tribal names of the North
American Indians, now well advanced toward completion, the general
character and object of which have been set forth in a former report.

While in general charge of that division of the oftice work he specially
attended to the Sahaptinian, Salishan, Chemakuman, Chinookan, and
several other linguistic stocks of the Pacific slope.

During the first five months of the year Mr. A. 8S. Gatschet was en-
gaged in digesting the results of his recent trip to Louisiana, Texas, and
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mexico, and utilizing them in the compilation of the Indian tribal
synonomy now in course of preparation by the Bureau.

His designated share in that work comprised the families of the south-
ern Indians from the Rio Grande to the Atlantic sea-board of Florida,
namely, the stocks of the Natchez, Atakapa, Shetimasha, Tonkawe,
Pakawa (otherwise known under the vague designation of ‘ Coahuilteco
o Tejano”), Tonica, Yuchi, and Tim mucua, and the most important stock
of them all, the Maskoki family. His work of correlating the informa-
tion of these tribes for the synonomy can now be considered as com-
pleted, though some important tribes can not be classified linguistically,
e. g., the Koroas and Pascagoulas, on account of the absence of all
information in the documents of early chroniclers relating to these
extinet tribes. The Adai, classed by Gallatin as a distinct family, is
believed by Mr. Gatschet to be affiliated with the Caddoan stock as a
dialect distantly related to YAtassi and Caddo proper.

After concluding his labors on the tribal synonomy, Mr. Gatschet re-
sumed his work on the grammar of the Klamath language of south-
western Oregon. He combined all the results of his recent studies of
both dialects, the northern and the southern, with the facts previously
aequired by him and composed a treatise on the morphology of the lan-
guage. This has now been rewritten three times by him in order to
secure completeness and accuracys The *‘phonetics” are already cast
in plates as are the chapters on radicals and on prefixion.

From July to December, 1887, Rev. J. Owen Dorsey was engaged in
translating the Teton texts of Mr. George Bushotter, a Dakotan, who
was working under his direction. Mr. Bushotter’s collection consists
of myths, legends, historical papers, an autobiography, accounts of
games, folk-lore and epistles, amounting to two hundred and fifty-eight
textual manuscripts. This work was continued until the following
December when Bushotter resigned, leaving one hundred and twenty-
nine texts to be translated. Mr. Dorsey then continued the work alone
until April 18, 1888, when another Dakotan, Mr. John Bruyier, of Chey-
enne River Agency, began to revise and interpret the Teton texts,
making many corrections in the originals, and supplying important
parts omitted by Bushotter.

Mr. Bruyier also furnished Mr. Dorsey with many examples of the
Teton, as spoken at the Cheyenne River Reservation, which showed that
it differed considerably from that spoken at the Lower Brulé and Pine
Ridge Reservations. He also wrote new versions of several myths,
continuing his work until June 30, 1888.

During the autumn of 1887, Mr. Dorsey completed his work on the
Siouan, Caddoan, Athapasean, Takilman, Kusan, and Yakonan cards
for the Indian synonomy referred to in a former report of the Director.
ie also prepared nearly four hundred type-written foolseap pages of
(ehiga epistles, legends, and other texts, which constitute an important
addition to those published in the Contributions to North American
Vee atte

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 71

Ethnology, vol. v1, part 1. He also transliterated on slips in alpha-
betic order his Winnebago material, obtained in 1878—79, collating it
with the additional material obtained in 1886. This contains fully four
thousand entries.

He gave much attention to the Catawba language, collating parts of
a recent vocabulary (that procured by Mr. Gatschet) with all others
which were accessible.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin contributed to the Indiansynonomy with reference
to several tribes in Oregon and California, and devoted much study to
the large number of myths obtained by him from the same tribes, also
to those of the Iroquois.

Mr. James C. Pilling has continued throughout the year to give a por-
tion of his time to the preparation of bibliographies of the more impor-
tant stocksof North American languages. As stated in the last report,
the manuscript for the Siouan bibliography, the second of the series, was
sent to the printer late in the fiscal year 1886~87. The proof was read
during the summer months and the work received from the Public
Printer November 12. Work was then begun on the Iroquoian stock of
languages, and the close of the fiscal year found it ready for the printer.
Some preliminary work was also done on the Muskokian bibliography.
Late in December Mr. Pilling made a visit to the library of the His-
torical Society of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia, for the purpose of
inspecting and taking descriptions of several important manuscripts in
Indian languages, written by Moravian missionaries, manuscripts then
temporarily in that city and permanently preserved in the Moravian
archives at Bethlehem, Pa., and Fairfield, Canada.

Mr. James Mooney, when notin the field, continued to be charged with
the synonomy relating to the Iroquoian and Algonkin linguistie stocks,
and also worked upon the vocabularies, myths, and notes of informa-
tion procured by him from the northern Cherokees.

During the entire year, except at short intervals when he visited the
field to make personal observations, Professor Thomas has been busily
engaged upon his report. The manuscript for the first volume with
the illustrations was presented for publication about a month before
the close of the fiscal year. The manuscript, illustrations, and maps for
the second volume are well under way and will soon be ready for publi-
cation. Mr. Henry L. Reynolds, from December until the close of the
fiscal year, was at Washington occupied in the preparation of maps,
plates, and diagrams for the report.

During the winter and until the Ist of May, 1888, Mr. Gerard Fowke
was engaged in preparing a paper for areport on the articles of stone
in the Bureau collections.

Mr. W. H. Holmes has charge of the illustrations intended for the
Bureau publications as in previous years, and has as far as possible con-
tinued his studies in aboriginal art and archeology.

The collections acquired during the summer, although not lacking
I2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

interest and value, are not so extensive as those of previous years.
Acquisitions are wade in three distinct ways: first, through members
of the Bureau and the Geological Survey who act as collectors ; second,
by means of exchange for publications or duplicate specimens from
previous collections; and third, by donation. Professor Thomas and
his assistants, working in the Mississippi Valley and on the Atlantic.
slope, report but few accessions during the year. Mr. James Steven-
son secured important collections from the Pueblo country, especially
from the villages of Jemez and Silla, in the Jemez Valley, New Mexico.
These collections include about five hundred specimens of pottery and
nearly four hundred of stone, wood, and other substances. A large per-
centage of these specimens are ancient. A considerable number of
ancient relics of pottery and stone were obtained from ancient ruin sites
in the Jemez and Rio Grande Valleys, New Mexico, by the Director and
Mr. Holmes. Mr. A. P. Davis collected a numberof fragments of ancient
pottery from the ruin of Pueblo Alto, New Mexico. A very interesting
series of objects, illustrating the present condition of the arts among
the Cherokee and Catawba Indians, was procured by Mr. James Mooney
of the Bureau. Mr. DeLancey W. Gill, of the Geological Survey, has
added to the collection many specimens of rude stone implements
from the vicinity of Washington. Donations have been received from
the following persons: Mr. C. C. Jones, fragments of ancient pottery
from Stallings Island, near Augusta, Ga.; Dr. Taylor, fragments of
ancient pottery from Baldwin County, Ala.; General G. P. Thruston,
fraginent of an enormous earthen vase from a suburb of Nashville,
Tenn.; Mr. W. W. Adams, articles of stone from Union Springs, N. Y.;
Mr. C. L. R. Wheeler, cast of a unique stone knife from Westchester
County, N. Y.; and Mr. James Tilton, fragments of pottery from Plum
Island, Massachusetts.

By exchange for books and duplicates from the National Museum the
following acquisitions have been made: .

From Mr. H. P. Hamilton, fragments of ancient pottery from Two
Rivers, Wis., and from Mr. H. W. Hakes, fragments of pottery from
Broome County, N. Y.

By purchase or part purchase the Bureau has obtained from Mr. J.
A. MeNiel one hundred and seventy pieces of ancient pottery from
Chiriqui, Panama, besides some very interesting objects of stone. From
Mr. Ward Bachelor it has acquired a fine collection of earthen and
stone objects from Mexico. From Dr. E. Boban a few fine samples of
Mexican pottery were obtained. All these have been catalogued and
turned over to the National Museum.

Mr. L. B. Case, of Richmond, Ind., has presented to the Bureau the
records of the State Archwologic Association of Indiana, which fell
into his hands as secretary at the discontinuance of the society several
years ago.

Valuable photographs of archologic subjects have been received

from Prof. Anastasio Alfaro, secretary of the National Museum of Costa
Rica; also from Mr. C. F. Low, of Cincinnati; from Mr. A. F. Sears,
of Portland, Oregon; and Mr. D.S. Sears, of Cuba, I].

During the first two months of the fiscal year Mr. Victor Mindeleff
was engaged upon a report on the architecture of the Cibola and Tus-
ayan groups of pueblos, in New Mexico and Arizona. Subsequent to
his return from the field on March 18 that repoit was resumed, but it
was not completed at the end of the fiscal year. The additional data
secured from the Tusayan district during the field season is being pre-
pared for incorporation into the same report.

During the early part of the year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was oceupied
upon that portion of the report on pueblo architecture which had been
assigned to him. On his return from the field on February 23 he re-
sumed work upon that report, but it was suspended in order to take up
the preparation of an exhibit to be made by the Bureau at the Cinein-
nati Centennial Exposition. An exhibit to cover nearly 2,000 square
feet of floor space was prepared, but as the space was limited only the
field work of the Bureau in one especial region, viz, the Pueblo coun-
try, was illustrated, though a small amount of other material was added
for purposes of comparison. This work was not completed at the close
of the fiscal year.

The work of the modeling room was continued throughout the year
in his charge. No new work was taken up, all available labor being
used in preparing a series of duplicates of models previously deposited
in the National Museum. This work was continued from last year. The
series is not yet completed, but the accumulations on hand at the end
of the fiscal year were sufficient to enable the Bureau to make a credit-
able display at the Cincinnati Centennial Exposition without withdraw-
ing, to any large extent, the models deposited in the National Museum.
During the year eight models were added to the duplicate series, and
thrée other models commenced.

Dr. Washington Matthews, surgeon U.S. Army, continued work upon
a grammar and dictionary of the Navajo language.

Mr. EK. W. Nelson was still engaged in the completion of his paper
mentioned in the last 1eport upon the Eskimo of northern Alaska, com-
prising a dictionary with notes upon the grammar of the language and
also upon the myths and customs of the people.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt has continued the study of the Iroquoian lan-
guages and the preparation of a Tuscarora-English dictionary. He
also worked upon the comparison of words, radicals, and terms in the
Iriquoian languages with those in the Cherokee, and in determining the
prehistoric habitat of the Iroquois.

The work of Mr. Charles C. Royce, before reported upon, presenting
the former title of Indian tribes to lands within the present boundaries
of the United States, and the methods of securing their relinguishment,
was substantially prepared for publication, the charts having all been
finished.
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

for several years past it has been part of the work of the Bureau to
take advantage of the frequent presence in Washington of parties styled
“delegations,” of the several Indian tribes visiting the capital, for the
purpose of photographing all the individuals composing them. These
are generally the prominent men of the tribes represented by them and
their photographs have biographie and historic interest as well as an-
thropologic importance. Mr. J. K. Hillers has been in charge of this
branch of the work, and during the past year has secured ninety-nine
photographs of prominent Indians in both full face and profile, in order
to exhibit to better advantage all their facial characteristics. The sub-
jects were from the following tribes, viz:

White Mountain Apache, 15 persons ; Chiracahua Apaches, 20; Jica-
rilla Apaches, 8; Sac and Fox, 7; Utes, 4; Shawnee, 9; Omaha, 20;
Dakota, 11; Oto and Missouri, 5.

In connection with the name of each Indian photographed it has been
the practice to note his age, status in the tribe, and such biographie in-
formation as could be obtained.

NECROLOGY.
MORRISON R. WAITE, CHANCELLOR.

In the order of official precedence, I am called on to first mention the
loss sustained by the Institution during the year, of its Chancellor, the
late eminent Chief-Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Morri-
son R. Waite, who died in this city on the 23d of March last (1888).

His biography belongs to the whole country; but though I have only
to speak of his relations to this Institution, yet one who knew him even
in this limited part of his important duties can not but feel that his was
a character of a singular sincerity, in the proper meaning of the word ;
so that it has been well said of him that he possessed not only a moral
but an intellectual integrity. Of the affection, as well as respect, he
inspired, I have already spoken. Remarkable for this admirable sim-
plicity of character as for his kindness of heart, in his unwavering con-
scientiousness of purpose in the discharge of every duty, he made him-
self, perhaps, the most influential and efficient Chancellor among the
very able ones the Institution has been so fortunate as to possess.
Taking pains to acquaint himself accurately with the character and
requirements of the Institution, evincing an earnest sympathy in its
objects and in its:adopted policy, he was a faithful attendant on the
meetings of the Board during the fourteen years of his presidency.

It seems proper to here record, as a part of the official history of this
bereavement, that a special meeting of the Board of Regents was called
on the 27th of March, 1888, to take appropriate action on the occasion,
and that the following resolutions, expressive of the generai sentiment,
were unanimously adopted and placed upon the journal of the
Board:

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has
been called to meet in extraordinary session by the afflicting intelligence
that Morrison Remick Waite, late Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States and late Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution,
has been removed by the hand of death from the scenes of his high ac-
tivities and distinguished usefulness: Therefore be it

Resolved, That sitting as we do at this time and place, in the very
center of that dark shadow which has fallen upon the whole land in the
lamented death of the late Chief-Justice Waite, and appalled as we are
by the suddenness as well as by the magnitude of the great affliction
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which in coming to the nation at large has come to us individually with
an added pi ithos of sorrow, because of the nearer view we have had for
so many years of the talents, virtues, and graces which found their fa-
miliar home in the person of our honored friend, we could with much
good reason crave for ourselves, in this hour of bereavement, the humble
permission of mourning apart, that we might silently gauge thedepth and
the dimensions of a calamity which brings to us its message of personal
grief and which has also torn away from our highest seat of justice its
venerated and beloved chief; from the legal profession of the country
its foremost official representative and therefore its crowning exponent;
from the walks of social life in this National Capital a commanding
presence, no less remarkable for his genial and open-hearted sincerity
than for his affable and gracious benignity; and from the Christian
communion a true and faithful disciple who witnessed a good confession
as much by the simplicity and humility with which he walked before
God as by the unswerving consistency with which he wore the ornament
of a pure heart and of a meek and quiet spirit before the scrutiny of his
fellow men.

Resolved, That while an obvious sense of propriety must dictate that
we should leave to others in that great forum which was the chosen
arena of his life’s career, the sad privilege of depicting, with minute and
detailed analysis, the remarkable combination of strong and lovely
traits which met in the person of the late Chief-Justice and gave to the
symmetrical character of our beloved friend its blended sweetness and
light, we can not omit, even in this hour of our special sorrow, to beai
cheerful testimony to the pleasing amenity with which he presided over
the deliberations of this council chamber as the Chancellor of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and sharing as we all do in a profound admiration
for the intelligence he brought to our discussions, while ever moder-
ating them by the guidance of his clear thought and mild wisdom, we can
but render our reverent homage to the eng aging @ personal qualities which
endeared him to us as a man; while at ‘the same time gratefully con-
fessing our obligations to him for the provident care and deep interest
which. he always brought to the discharge of his official duties in this
place, where through all the years of his honorable and useful service
at the head of this Board, the Secretary of the Institution, in common
with ourselves, has lea aned on him as the wise and true counsellor who
could be trusted as well for the rectitude of his moral intuitions as for
the clear perceptions of his calm and judicious intellect.

Resolved, That we will attend tbe funeral of our departed Chancellor
in a body, and that the Secretary of the Institution, together with a
deputation from the members of the Board, be requested to accompany
the other friends and associates of the late Chief. Justice, who will bear
his remains to their last resting-place in Ohio.

Resolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the
Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send a copy of them to
the family of our departed friend, in token of our sincere condolence
with them in their great affliction.

It only remains for your Secretary to add that, in accordance with
your request, he proceeded to Toledo, where he was joined by one of
your body, Dr. J. B. Angell, and in his company paid the final tribute
of respect, by representing your honorable body at the obsequies of
this eminent and good man.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 77
PROFESSOR BAIRD.

I have referred, at the beginning of this report, to the death of the late
Secretary. Both the greatness of the loss to science and to this Insti-
tution make me feel the need of speaking again and more particularly
both of him and of bis work.

When, in January, 1887, the Secretary asked of your honorable body
authority to appoint two assistant secretaries to relieve him from the
growing burden of his official occupations, it was doubtless with the
consciousness that his failing strength no longer permitted the contin-
uous attention to his varied duties which he had previously, with ready
zeal, bestowed. When, under the imperative orders of his physician, he
withdrew himself (as much as his active mental interest permitted)
from the executive operations of his position, the comparative relaxa-
tion of effort and responsibility seemed to have been accepted too late
to give him its expected relief and recuperation ; and his exhausted
powers continued to decline until he quietly breathed his last, on the
afternoon of the 19th of August, 1887, at the headquarters of the U.S.
Commission of Fisheries, at Wood’s Holl.

In recognition of his distinguished services, a bill was introduced in
the Senate of the United States, and passed by that body February 10,
1888, making an appropriation for the erection of a bronze statue to
commemorate his merits.

A bill was also introduced in the Senate for the benefit of his widow.

At aspecial meeting of the Board of Regents, held November 18,
1887, the following resolutions were passed :

Whereas, in the dispensation of Divine Providence, the mortal life
of Spencer Fullerton Baird was ended on the 19th of August last, the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, now at the earliest practicable
moment assembled, desire to express and torecord their profound sense
of the great loss which this Institution has thereby sustained, and
which they personally have sustained. And they accordingly resolve :

1. That, in the lamented death of Professor Baird, the Institution is
bereaved of its honored and efficient Secretary, who has faithfully and
unremittingly devoted to its service his rare administrative abilities for
thirty-seven years—that is, almost from the actual foundation of the
establishment—for the last nine years as its chief executive officer, under
whose sagacious management it has greatly prospered and widely ex-
tended its usefulness and its renown.

2. That the National Museum, of which this Institution is the ad-
ministrator, and the Fish Commission, which is practically affiliated to
it, both organized and in ajust sense created by our late Secretary, are
by this bereavement deprived of the invaluable and unpaid services of
their indefatigable official head.

3. That the cultivators of science, both in this country and abroad,
have to deplore the loss of a veteran and distinguished naturalist, who
was from early years a sedulous and successful investigator ; whose
hative gifts and whose experience in systematic biolegical work served
in no small degree to adapt him to the administrative duties which
filled the later years of his life, but whose knowledge and whose inter-
est in science widened aud deepened as the opportunities for special
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

investigation lessened, and who accordingly used his best endeavors
to promote the researches of his fellow naturalists in every part of
a world.

. That his kindly disposition, equable temper, singleness of aim, and
ere purity of motive, along with his facile mastery of affairs,
greatly endeared him to his subordinates, secured to him the confidence
and trust of those whose influence he sought for the advancement of
the interests he had at heart, and won the high regard and warm af-
fection of those who, like the members of this Board, were officially and
intimately associated with him.

5. That, without intrudiug into the domain of private sorrow, the
Regents of the Institution would respectfully offer to the family of their
late Secretary the assurance of their profound sympathy.

6. That the Regents invite the near associate of the late Secretary,
Professor Goode, to prepare a memorial of the life and services of Pro-
fessor Baird for publication in the ensuing annual report of the Insti-
tution.

The address made by Maj. J. W. Powell, an old and personal friend
of the late Secretary, at the memorial meeting held by the scientific
societies of Washington January 11, 1888, containe:l so just and elo-
quent a tribute to Professor Ran memory, that I feel inclined to
quote from it a few words which, it seems to me, will characterize the
large purpose and attainment of his life, and its relation to others, bet-
ter than any of my own:

‘¢ Baird was one of the learned men of the world. He knew the birds
of the air; he knew the beasts of the forests and the prairies, and the
reptiles that crawl through desert sands or slimy marshes; he knew
the fishes that scale mountain torrents, that bask in quiet lakes, or that
journey from zone to zone through the deep waters of the sea. The
treasures of the land did not satisfy the desires of Baird; he must also
have the treasures of the sea, and so he organized a fish commission,
with its great laboratories and vessels of research.

“The Fish Commission was an agency of research ; but it was more ;
he made it an ageney by which science is applied to the relief of the
wants of mankind—by which a che: ap, nutritious, healthful, and luxuri-
ous food is to be given to the millions of men.

“In the research thus organized the materials for the work of other
scientific men were ¢ eathered. He incited the men personally to under-

take and continuously prosecute their investigations. He enlisted the

men himself; he trained them himself; he himself furnished them with
the materials and instruments of res se: ich, and, best of all, was their
guide and great exemplar. Thus it was that the three institutions
over which | he presided—the Smithsonian Institution, the National
Museum, and the Fish Commission—were woven into one great organi-
zation, a university of instruction in the methods of scientific Reece
including in its scope the entire field of biology and anthropology

corn his work with his assistants, he scrupulously provided that: every
one should receive the meed of honor due for successful research, and

sated all with generosity. Many an investigation begun by himself,
was turned over to assistants when he found that v: uluable conclusions
could be reached ; and these assistants, who were his warm friends, lis
younger brothers, reaped the reward ; ‘and he had more joy over every
young man’s success than over the triumphs and honors heaped upon
himself from every quarter of the globe. He was the sympathetic coun-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

selor of many men; into his ears were poured the sorrows and joys of
others, and he mourned with the mourning, and rejoiced with the re-
joicing. His life at home was pure and sweet and full of joys, for he
gave and received love and trust and tender care. But the history of
his home life is sacred.

“Wor many long months he contemplated the day of parting. Labor
that knew no rest, responsibility that was never lifted from his shoulders,
too soon brought his life to an end. In the summer of the past year he
returned to his work by the sea-side, that he might die in its midst.
There at Wood’s Holl he had created the greatest biologic laboratory of
the world ; and in that laboratory, with the best results of his life-work
all about him, he calmly and philosophically waited for the time of
times.”

The memorial which is being prepared, in obedience to the desire of
the Regents, by the Assistant Secretary of the Institution, is partly writ-
ten, but the pressure of official work has prevented its completion in
time for publication in the present report.

It seems essential, however, that this report should not be pub-
lished without at least a brief biographical sketch of my predecessor

from one of his scientific family, and the following notice, which antici-
pates the coming fuller memorial by Dr. Goode, has accordingly been
prepared by him at my request.

“ Spencer Fullerton Baird was born February 3, 1523, in Reading, a
town in southeastern Pennsylvania about 60 miles from Philadelphia,
where his ancestors, people of education and prominent in the commu-
nity, had lived for several generations. About 1834 his mother, then a
widow, removed to Carlisle. Carlisle was the seat of Deities Col-
lege, whore he was graduated in 1840, at the age of seventeen. His
tastes for scientific investigation had already developed in such a re-
markable manner that his mother felt that she was justified in allowing
him, after graduation, to devote himself for a time to his favorite pur-
suits, and his time for several years was devoted to studies in general
natural history, to long pedestrian excursions for the purpose of observ-
ing animals and Pianes and collecting specimens, and to the organiza-
tion of a private cabinet of natural history, which a few years later be-
came the nucleus of the museum of the Smithsonian Institution. During
this period he published a number of original papers on natural his-
tory. There were at that time no schools for young naturalists, and
his education was in large degree self-directed ; during this time, how-
ever, he partially completed a course in medicine at the College of
Physicans and Surgeons in New York,* and drew inspiration and in-
struction from such men as Audubon and others of the older natural-
ists whom at this period he visited, forming the foundation of lifelong
friendships. His home studies continued for six years, and were
scarcely interrupted by his election in 1841 to the chair of natural his-

* He read medicine w ith Dr, Middleton Goldsmith, and attended a winter course of
lectures at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, in 1342. His medical
course was never formally completed, although in 1848 he received the degree of
M. D., honoris causa, from the Philadelphia Medical College.
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tory and chemistry in his own college, where he remained until 1850,
having married, meantime, Miss Mary H. Churchill, the daughter of
General Sylvester Churchill, U. S. Army, for many years Inspector-
General.

‘¢The inheritance of a love of nature and a taste for scientific classi-
fication, together with the companionship of a brother similarly gifted,
tended to the development of the young naturalist. In 1841, at theage
of eighteen, we find him making an ornithological excursion through
the mountains of Pennsylvania, walking 400 miles in twenty-one days,
the last day 60 miles between daylight and rest. The following year
he walked more than 2,200 miles. His fine physique and consequent
capacity for work are doubtless due in part to his outdoor life during
these years.

“The coming of Agassiz to the United States in 1846, was an inspira-
tion to him, and one of the first great works projected by the Swiss sa-
vant was a joint memoir upon the fishes of North America, which was
enthusiastically begun by the young Dickinson professor, but never
brought to the point of publication.

“ Agassiz did not become established in Cambridge until 1848, and it
is to’ Baird rather than to him that should belong the credit of having
introduced into American schools the system of laboratory practice and
field explorations in connection with natural history instruction. Mon-
cure D. Conway, who was one of his pupils, has often told me how fas-
cinating were Professor Baird’s explanations of natural phenomena, and
how the contagion of his enthusiasm spread among his pupils, who fre-
quently followed him through the fields and woods 20 or 30 miles a day.

‘¢ His mentor at this period was the Hon. George P. Marsh, of Vermont,
already prominent in publie affairs, and his warm friend and admirer.*
To him Professor Baird felt that he owed his real start in life, for Mr.
Marsh, feeling that his protégé was disposed to bury himself too deeply
in the technicalities of a specialty, proposed that he should undertake
the translation and editorship of an edition of the ‘ Iconographie Eney-
clopwdia,’ a version of Heck’s Bilder-Atlas, published in connection with
the famous Conversations-Lexikon of Brockhaus. This task, though ex-
ceedingly laborious and confining to a young man of twenty-six, en-
tirely untrained in literary methods, was efficiently and rapidly per-
formed, and resulted in a great extension of his tastes and sympathies,
while the training which he acquired was an excellent preparation for
the tremendous literary tasks which he undertook without hesitation
in later years. It was also to the interest of Mr. Marsh, who was one
of the earliest Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, that he owed his
nomination to the position of Assistant Secretary of that Institution,
then recently organized, which he accepted July 5, 1850, and October
3, at the age of twenty-seven years, entered upon his life-work in con-

“In Mrs. Caroline Marsh’s lately published biography of her ‘husband many inter-
esting letters from Mr. Marsh to Professor Baird are quoted.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81

nection with that foundation, “ the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” His appointment, if we may judge from a statement in
Professor Henry’s fifth report, was due quite as much to his training
in editorial methods as to his professional acquirements. His appoint-
ment, it is stated, was made at this time more particularly in order that
his services might be secured to take charge of the publications, ana
that the Institution might take advantage of the ample experience which
he had gained in this kind of work.

“Tt was, of course, impossible that the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution could have appreciated the fact that he had invented, in
connection with his work upon his own private collections, a system of
museum administration which was to be of the utmost value in the de-
velopment of the great National Museum which he afterward was instru-
mental in founding. All the elaborate and efficient methods of admin-
istration which are now in use in the National Museum were present,
in germ at least, in the little private museum which grew up under
his control at home, and which he brought with him in a single freight
car to form the nucleus of the great Smithsonian collections.* Among
the treasures of this collection, which are still cherished by the Institu-
tion, were a number of the choicest bird skins collected by Audubon,
who had always felt for him a sincere friendship from the time when
he proposed to the boy of seventeen that he should accompany him on
a voyage to the headwaters of the Missouri, and become his partner in
the preparation of a great work on the quadrupeds of North America,
which afterward he brought out in conjunction with Bachman, of South
Carolina.

“The first grant made by the Institution for scientific exploration

* The only specimens in possession of the Institution at the time of his arrival were
a few boxes of minerals and plants. The collections of the Wilkes Exploring Expedi-
tion, which constitute the legal foundation of the National Museum of the United
States, were at that time under the charge of the National Institute; and although
by the act of incorporation the Smithsonian Institution was the legal custodian of
the national cabinet of curiosities, it was not until 1857 that the Regents finally ac-
cepted the trust, and the National Museum was definitely placed under the control
of the Smithsonian Institution and transferred to its building. Until this time Con-
gress had granted no funds for the support of the Smithsonian cabinets, and the collee-
tions had been acquired and cared for at the expense of the endowment fund. They
had, however, become so large and important in 1857 that the so-called ‘‘ National
Collection” at that time acquired was small in comparison.

The National Musenm thus had a double origin. Its actual although not its legal
nucleus was the collection gathered in the Smithsonian building prior to 1857. Its
methods of administration, which were in fact the very same that had been developed
by Professor Baird in Carlisle as early as 1845, are those which are still in use, and
which have stood the test of thirty years without any necessity for their modification
becoming apparent. In the Fifth Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution, now
exceedingly rare, is a report by the assistant seeretary in charge of the natural his-
tory department, for the year 1850, which enumerates the specimens belonging to the
Museum on Jannary 1, 1851, including a full account of his own deposit.

82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and field research was in 1848 to Spencer F. Baird, of Carlisle, for the
exploration of the bone caves and the local natural history of south-
eastern Pennsylvania.

“From the start the department of explorations was under his
charge, and in his reports to the Secretary, published year by year in
the annual report of the Institution, may be found the only systematic
record of Government explorations which has ever been prepared.

“The decade beginning with 1850 was a period of great activity in
exploration. Our frontier was being rapidly extended toward the
West, but in the territory between the Mississippi and the Pacific coast
were immense stretches of country practically unknown. Numerous
Government expeditions were sent forth, and immense collections in
every department of natural history were gathered and sent to Wash-
ington to be studied and reported upon. The Smithsonian Institution
had been designated by law the custodian of these collections, and
within the walls of its buildings assembled the naturalists by whose
exertions these collections had been brought together. Professor Baird

yas surrounded by conditions most congenial and stimulating, for he
found full scope for his administrative skill in the work of arranging
the scientific outfits for these expeditions, preparing instructions for
the explorers, and above all in inspiring them with enthusiasm for the
work. To him also fell in large part the task of receiving the collec-
tions, arranging for the necessary investigations, and the collation and
publication of their results. The natural histery portions of the re-
ports of the Mexican boundary survey, the Pacific Railroad surveys, the
expeditions of Ives, Emory, Stansbury, and others, were under his su-
pervision, as well as, in considerable degree, the natural history collec-
tions of the Wilkes exploring expedition, which were still under inves-
tigation. :

“The period of the civil war was one of comparative quiet, but much
was accomplished by Baird and his pupils, and two of his most impor-
tant memoirs, viz, Review of North American Birds and The Distribu-
tion and Migrations of North American Birds, were published. During
this decade, too, continued the summer expeditions usually extending
over three months, which were becoming yearly more and more exclu-
sively devoted to the investigation of marine life, and which ultimately
led to the organization of the Fish Commission in 1871. During the
latter part of this decade the early impressions of his work in connec-
tion with the Iconographic Encyclopedia began to revive, and a new
interest was shown by Professor Baird in the popularization of scien-
tific subjects. At the solicitation of Mr. George W. Childs, in 1867 he
began to devote a column to scientific intelligence in the Philadelphia
Public Ledger, and about 1870 he became the scientific editor of the
periodicals published by the Harper Brothers, of New York. His con-
nection with this firm continued until 1878, and in addition to the weekly
and monthly issues there resulted eight annual volumes of the Annual
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

Record of Seience and Industry, the successor of the Annual of Seien-
tific Discovery, established by David A. Wells, in 1850. When Pro-
fessor Baird became Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution bis edito-
rial labors were abandoned, but the idea of his Annual Record of Science
and Industry was continued in the yearly appendices to the Smithsonian
report under the title of Record of Progress, and the scientific work of
the world for as many consecutive years is passed in review in the thirty-
eight volumes which combine the three series just referred to.

“In the memoir which the writer is preparing it is his intention to
discuss in detail the great labors of Professor Baird in scientifie admin-
istration and investigation, but his life was so full that it is only by
careful condensation that even an outline of its eventful features can
be brought within the brief limits of this notice.

‘There may be noted in the career of Professor Baird several dis-
tinct phases of activity, namely: (1) A period of twenty-six years
(1843-1869) occupation in laborious investigation and voluminous pub-
lication upon the vertebrate fauna of North America; (2) forty years
(1840-1880) of continuous contribution to scientific editorship; (3) five
years (1845-1850) devoted to educational work; (4) forty-four years
(1843-1887) devoted to the encouragement and promotion of scientific
enterprises and the development of new workers among the young men
with whom he was brought in contact; (5) thirty-seven years (1550-
1887) devoted to administrative work as an officer of the Smithsonian
Institution and in charge of the scientific collections of the Government,
twenty-eight (1850-1878) as principal executive officer, and nine (1878—
1887) as Secretary and responsible head; (6) sixteen years (1871-1837)
as head of the Fish Commission, a philanthropic labor for the increase
of the food supply of the world, and, incidentally, in promoting the
interests of biological and physical investigation of the waters.

“The extent of his contributions to science and scientific literature
may be at least partially comprehended by an examination of the bib-
liography of his publications issued by the Institution in 1883.* The
list of his writings is complete to the end of the year 1882, and contains
1,063 titles. Of this number, 775 are brief notices and critical reviews
contributed to the Annual Record of Science and Industry, while under
his editorial charge; 31 are reports relating tothe work of the Smith-
sonian Institution; 7 are reports upon the American fisheries ; 25 are
schedules and circulars officially issued, and 25 are volumes or papers
edited. Outof the remaining 200 the majority are formal contributions
to scientific literatnre, among them the two classical works upon the
Mammals of North America and the Birds of North America (Volumes
Vill and 1x of the Pacific Railroad Reports). These were the only ex-
tended systematic treatises upon those groups which bad at that time
been prepared, of scope suflicient to embrace the fauna of the entire
continent. They are still standard works of reference, and every spec-

merit.

“Of the total number of papers enumerated in the list, 73 relate to
mammals, 80 to birds, 43 to reptiles, 431 to fishes, 61 to invertebrates
(these being chiefly reviews), 16 to plants, 85 to geographical distribu-
tion, 46 to geology, mineralogy, and paleontology; 45 to anthropology,
31 to industry and art, and 109 to exploration and travel.

“While the number of new species deseribed does not necessarily
afford any clew to the value of the work accomplished, it may not be
uninteresting to refer to it as an indication of the pioneer work which
it was necessary to do even in so prominent a group as the vertebrates.

logue of serpents not more than 60 per cent. had been named, and in
preparation for studying the specimens each was carefully ticketed with
its locality, and then the 2,000 or more individuals were thrown indis-
criminately into one erent pile, and the work of sorting them out by
resemblances was begun. Not the least valuable have been the numer-
ous accurate figures of North American vertebrates, prepared under
Professor Baird’s supervision. These include representatives of 170
species of mammals and 160 species of reptiles, besides many hundreds
of birds.

“On the 9th of February, 1874, Congress passed a joint resolution
which authorized the appointment of a Commissioner of Fish and Fish-
eries. The duties of the Commissioner were thus defined: ‘To prose-
cute investigations on the subject (of the diminution of valuable fishes)
with the view of ascertaining whether any and what diminution in the
number of the food-fishes of the coast and the lakes of the United
States has taken place, and, if so, to what causes the same is due; and
also whether any and what protective, prohibitory, or precautionary
measures should be adopted in the premises, and to report upon the
same to Congress,’

“The resolution establishing the office of Commissioner of Fisheries
required that the person to be appoipted should be a civil officer of the
Government, of proved scientific and practical acquaintance with the
fishes of the coast, to serve without additional salary. The choice was
thus practically limited to a single man. Professor Baird, at that time
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was appointed, and,
at once entering upon his duties, soon developed a systematic scheme
of investigation.

*“ The Fish Commission now fills a place tenfold more exteusive and
useful than at first. Its work is naturally divided into three sections :

“(1) The systematic investigation of the waters of the United States
and the biological and physical problems which they present. The
scientific studies of the Commission are based upon a liberal and phil-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85

osophical interpretation of the law. In making his original plans the
Commissioner insisted that to study only food-fishes would be of little
importance, and that useful conclusions must needs rest upon a broad
foundation of investigations purely scientific in character. The life his-
tory of species of economic value should be understood from beginning
to end, but no less requisite is it to know the histories of the animals
aud plants upon which they feed or upon which their food is nourished ;
the histories of their enemies and friends, and the friends and foes of
their enemies and friends, as well as the currents, temperatures, and
other physical phenomena of the waters in relation to migration, repro-
duction, and growth. A necessary accom) lishment to this division is
the amassing of material for research to be stored in the National and
other museums for future use.

“(2) The investigation of the methods of fisheries, past and present,
and the statistics of production and commerce of fishery products. Man
being one of the chief destroyers of fish, his influence upon their abun-
dance must be studied. Fishery methods and apparatus must be ex-
amined and compared with those of other lands, that the use of those
which threaten the destruction of useful fishes may be discouraged,
and that those which are inefficient may be replaced by others more
serviceable. Statistics of industry and trade must be secured for the
use of Congress in making treaties or imposing tariffs, to show to pro-
ducers the best markets, and to consumers where and with what their
needs may be supplied.

“(3) Theintroduction and multiplication of useful food fishes through-
out the country, especially in waters under the jurisdiction of the Gen-
eral Government, or those common to several States, none of which
might feel willing to make expenditures for the benefit of the others.
This work, which was not contemplated when the Commission was es-
tablished, was first undertaken atthe instance of the American Fish
Cultural Association, whose representatives induced Congress to make
a special appropriation for the purpose.

‘‘ His relation to the organizations with which he was so closely iden-
tified, the Smithsonian Institution, its ward, the National Museum, and
the Fish Commission, can in this place only be incidentally mentioned,
and the numerous biographical notices which have appeared since his
death have not failed to review critically the significance of his connee-
tion with them and his influence upon them. To his friends who knew
him best and miss him most it seems pleasanter to dwell upon the ree-
ognition which his labors received than upon the labors themselves, his
devotion to which shortened his life so many years.

* Almost every civilized country in the world has paid him nonor,
In 1875 he received the decoration of Knight of the Royal Norwegian
order of St. Olaf from the King of Norway and Sweden. In 1873 he
was awarded the silver medalof the Acclimatization Society of Mel-
bourne, and in 1879 the gold medal of the Société dAcclimation of
France. In 1856 he received the degree of doctor of physical science
from Dickinson College, and in 1875 that of doctor of laws from Co-
lumbian University. A few months before his death, on the occasion of
the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Harvard University, the
same degree, ad eundem, Was conferred on him as an eminent promoter of
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

science. This was one of the few oceasions upon which he was induced
to ascend the platform in a public place. He was one of the early mem-
bers of the National Academy of Sciences, and ever since the organiza-
tion was a member of its council. In 1850 and 1851 he served as per-
manent secretary of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, and since 1878 was one of the trustees of the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, Washington. He was a president of the Cosmos Club,
and for many years a trustee of Columbian University. Among his
honorary relations to numerous scientific societies of the United States
and other countries are included those of foreign membership in the Lin-
niean Society of London and the Zoological Society of London, hon-
orary membership in the Linnean Society of New South Wales, and cor-
responding membership in the K. K. Zoologisch-botanische Gesellschaft,
Vienna; the Sociedad de Geographia, Lisbon; the New Zealand Insti.
tute; the Koninklijke Natuurkundige Vereeniging in Nederlandsch
Indié, Batavia; the Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia, Buda-Pesth; the
Société Nationale des Sciences Naturelles, Cherbourg; the Academia
Germanica Nature Curiosorum, Jena; the Naturforschende Gesellschaft,
Halle; the Naturhistorische Gesellschaft, Nuremberg; the Geograph-
ical Society, of Quebec; the Historical Society of New York; the
Deutsche Fischerei- Verein, Berlin.

“The nomenclature of zoology contains many memorials of his con-
nection with its history. A partial enumeration shows that over twenty-
five species and one genus of fishes bears his name, and that not less
than forty species have been named in his honor. These will for all
time be monuments to his memory as undying as the institutions which
he founded.

‘“* A post-office in Shasta County, Cal., located near the McCloud River
Salmon Hatching Station of the U. S. Fish Commission, was named
Baird by the Postmaster-General in 1877.

“Even Japan was not unmindful of Professor Baird’s services to
science, for from distant Yezo, the most northern island of the Japanese
Archipelago, came, soon after his death, a little volume beautifully
printed upon silk, containing his portrait and the story of his char-
acter.

“The importance of his services to fish-culture was perhaps more
fully recognized in Germany than in any other country, not excluding
the United States. In 1880, on the occasion of the first great Inter-
national Fishery Exhibition held in Berlin, his name was found to be
widely known among the scientific men there present. The magnificent
silver trophy which was the chief prize was awarded to him by the
Emperor William. This now stands in the fishery hall of the National
Museum. While Professor Baird’s portrait hung over the entrance to
the American section at Berlin, the Kammerherr von Behr, the presi-
dent of the German Fishery Union, the most powerful and influential
fishery organization in the world, never passed under it without taking

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87

off his hat in honor of the ‘ first fish-culturist of the world,’ as he de-
lighted to call him. He also insisted that any who might be in his
company should pay the same respect to Professor Baird. Indeed, L
am not sure that the late Emperor Frederick, at that time Crown Prince
and protector of the German fisheries, did not do homage in this way
tothe American philanthropist. After Professor Baird’s death a cir-
cular was issued by the German Fishery Union which contained a most
appreciative eulogy.

‘¢ His ever ready assistance to his fellow-workers in Europe won for
him their deep regard. Mr. R. Bowdler Sharpe, of the British Museum,
writes as follows to Nature: ‘As chief of the Smithsonian Institution
Professor Baird possessed a power of conferring benefits to the world
of science exercised by few directors of public museums, and the man-
ner in which he has utilized these powers has resulted not only in the
wonderful success of the United States National Museum under his
direction, but in the enrichment of many other museums. We know
by experience that the British Museum is indebted to Professor Baird
beyond measure. We had only to express our wants, and immediately
every effort was made to supply all the desiderata in our ornithological
collection.’

‘¢ Professor Baird was the most modest of men. He seemed never -to
care for public recognition. In speaking of any honors which he had
received he appeared to deprecate what had been done, as if ashamed
of the attentions, feeling himself unworthy to receive them.

‘“ He once remarked to me, some years before his death, that he was
satisfied that no man’s life was of such importance to the people among
whom he lived that he could not shortly be replaced by another who
would fully fill his place. As I looked at the man before me, a giant in
body and in mind, a treasury of untransferable experience and wisdom,
I thought to myself that if this judgment was a true one (which I did
not believe, nor, at bis heart, [ suppose, did be), in him at least there
was an exception. I speak not now of his official usefulness alone, but
of the broader and more essential relationships which he held to science
and to humanity.

‘“ Such a man has a thousand sides, each most familiar to a few, and
perhaps entirely strange to the greater part of those who know him.

“ Future historians of American science will be better able than are
we to estimate justly the value of the contributions to scientific litera-
ture which are enumerated in his bibliography; but no one not living
in the present can form an accurate idea of the personal influence of #
leader upon his associates and upon the progress of thought in his
special department, nor can such an influence as this well be set down
in words. This influence is apparently due not only to extraordinary
skill in organization, to great power of application and concentration
of thought constantly applied, and to a philosophical and comprehen-
88 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sive mind, but to an entire and self-sacrificing devotion to the interests
of his work and that of others.

‘« His extreme diffidence and lack of self-seeking were among his con-
Spicuous, characteristics. He was always averse to addressing audi-
ences, and this is all the more remarkable to his friends, who remem-
ber how winning and persuasive his eloquence was when he talked in
the presence of a few. His ability as a talker and organizer was never
better seen than when, as already observed, in the presence of Con-
gressional committees, before whom he was summoned from year to
year to give reasous for his requests for money to be used in expanding
the work of the Fish Commission or the National Museum. He was
always received by the members with the heartiest welcome; and it
seemed that always these pushing, brusque men of business, who ordi-
narily rushed with the greatest haste through the routine of committee
work, forgot their usual hurry when Professor Baird was before them.
They listened attentively as long as he could be induced to talk about
his plans for the development of the organizations whose success he
had at heart. Not unfrequently they would wander from the business
before them as they asked him questions upon subjects which his sug-
gestive remarks impressed upon their attention.

‘‘No man was more easily approached than Professor Baird. He
seemed especially fond of meeting young persons, whom he immedi-
ately set at their ease by his geniality and frankness of manner. A
writer in the Nation has said: ‘it seemed as if in his mind he had an
epitome of all the characteristics of mind and habit of each and every
man. No thought of self seemed to enter into his calculations. Those
who felt themselves the object cf his personal regard sometimes halted
for a moment in a comical dismay, perceiving themselves frankly moved,
like chessmen, in directions which they would not themselves have se-
lected, but an overwhelming sense of Baird’s entire devotion to the
promotion of science, his perfect unselfishness, and his incomparable
good judgment, always carried the day.’

“From his early youth until his failing strength forbade, he kept a
journal of his daily pursuits, and this, together with the immense piles
of copy-books and files of letters received, will afford a boundless treas-
ure to his biographer; and when his biography is written, if it be prop-
erly done in accordance with the modern theory of biography-making,
it will form essentially a history of the natural sciences in America for
the past half century.

‘For many months before his death he knew that his life was drawing
to a close. In the summer of 1887, a few weeks before he died, he went
to Wood’s Holl, as usual, to direct the operations of the Fish Commission.
Of all the tributes to his character none were more eloquent or touching
than one at the funeral service at Wood’s Holl. The simple burial
service was read, and then the clergyman recited these sentences from
the Sermon on the Mount: ‘Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 89
mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed
are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God.’ So
appropriate were these words that scarcely one of those present could
refrain from tears, realizing how great, how benevolent, how simple-
hearted had been the friend whom they had lost.”

A memorial meeting was held January 11, 1888, in the lecture-room
of the Columbian University of Washington, under the joint auspices of
the Philosophical, Anthropological, and Biological Societies of this city,
at which addresses were made by members of the several societies
commemorating the life and scientific work of Professor Baird.

An oil portrait of Professor Baird, of life-size, painted by Mr. Henry
Ulke, of this city, was purchased by the Regents for the Institution.

PROFESSOR ASA GRAY, REGENT.

In addition to the loss of our honored Chancellor and Secretary, the
Institution has further been called upon to mourn the decease of one of
the oldest and most distinguished members of the Board of Regents,
Dr. Asa Gray, whose death took place on the 30th day of January last
(1888), and brought the mournful loss not only of a great man of sci-
ence, intimately and long connected with the Institution, but of one
personally endeared to all who knew him.

Professor Gray may be said to have been identified with the Institu-
tion from its very beginning as a chosen and trusted counselor of its
first Secretary, and an active member of the Board from January, 1874.

Born in the town of Paris, Oneida County, N. Y., on the 18th of No-
vember, 1810, Professor Gray was at the time of his death, therefore,
over seventy-seven years of age, though few would have so supposed,
judging from his continued activity and vigor. He was graduated at
the Fairfield College of Physicians and Surgeons, Herkimer County,
N.Y., in 1831, as doctor of medicine. Relinquishing, however, his pro-
fession, he devoted himself to the study of botany under Professor
Torrey ; and he prosecuted for years this branch of natural history
with such zeal and energy as ultimately to even surpass the fame of
his distingushed preceptor, and to become the acknowledged chief of
American naturalists in his chosen field.

In 1842 he was elected the Fisher professor of natural history at
Harvard College,a position he retained for more than thirty years.
From this college he received, in 1844, the degree of A. M., and from
Hamilton College, in 1860, the degree of LL. D. He published various
botanical manuals and systematic treatises, several of which became
universally-accepted popular text-books. He was one of the original
members of the National Academy of Sciences, incorporated by act
of Congress March 3, 1863. From 1863 to 1873 he was president of the
90 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and was president of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science for the year 1872.

More than forty years ago, in the very infancy of this Institution, Dr.
Gray, at the instance of its Secretary, undertook to prepare for publica-
tion, under its auspices, a comprehensive illustrated work on American
Forest Trees. In the Secretary’s third report (for 1849) it is recorded,
with reference to contemplated ‘Reports on the Progress of Knowledge,”
that ‘the most important report now in progress is that on the Forest
Trees of North America, by Dr. Gray, professor of botany in Harvard
University. It is intended in this work to give figures from original
drawings of the flowers, leaves, fruit, etc., of each principal species in
the United States proper, for the most part of the size of nature, and
so executed as to furnish colored or uncolored copies; the first being
intended to give an adequate idea of the species, and the second for
greater cheapness and more general diffusion. This work will be com-
pleted in three parts, in octavo, with an atlas of quarto plates, the first
to be published next spring. - - - As the work will be adapted to
general comprehension, it will be of interest to the popular as well as
the scientific reader.”

This very interesting and important enterprise, delayed by Dr. Gray’s
visit to Europe the following year, and afterward from time to time
postponed by various hindrances, was never completed. Simultaneously
with his engagement upon this great work, other interests and investi-
gations were pressing upon his attention. A botanical expedition—
assisted by the Institution—made by Mr. Oharles Wright, through
Texas and New Mexico in the summer and autumn of 1849, was re-
warded by an extensive and valuable collection of the plants of these
regions, which were placed in the hands of Dr. Gray; and in 1851 it
was announced that his report on this new material was ready for pub-
lication. This memoir was issued in two parts, quarto size. Part 1,
comprising 146 pages of text, illustrated by ten engraved plates, was
included in Vol. 111 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,
and Part 1, comprising 119 pages, illustrated by 4 plates, was included
in Vol. v of Contributions to Knowledge.

In the winter of 185455 Dr. Gray delivered, in the lecture-room of
this Institution, a course of nine lectures “ On Vegetation.”

In 1884, Dr. Gray presented to Harvard College his herbarium, con-
taining more than 200,000 specimens, and his botanical library of more
than 2,500 works ; for the reception of which a fire-proof building was
provided. In 1873, he resigned his professorship in the college, retain-
ing, however, the charge of its herbarium. In 1874, he was selected by
joint resolution of Congress a Regent of this Institution, taking the
place made vacant by the death of Professor Agassiz, who had been a
Regent for the preceding ten years.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91
DR. PETER PARKER, EX-RHGENT.

While recounting the inroads made by death on the earlier por-
tion of the membership of the Institution and its Board of Regents, it
seems proper to notice also the demise of Dr. Peter Parker, who had
been a Regent from 1868 to 1884, when he was induced to resign his
position on the Board in consequence of infirmity and failing health.
His death occurred at his residence in this city on the 10th day of Jan--
uary last (1888).

The stated annual meeting of the Board occurring on the following
day (January 11, 1885), expression was given to the regret occasioned
thereby, in the following preamble and resolution:

Whereas the Board has received the afflictive intelligence that the
venerable Dr. Peter Parker, who for sixteen years was a member of the
Board of Regents, and who for this whole period served with fidelity
on its executive committee, has departed this life after a long career
filled with useful labors in the service of God and of man: Therefore,

Be it resolved, That in the retrospect of such a life-career, protracted
as it was beyond the limit usually allotted to men, and yet at each stage
of its progress dedicated to beneficent works in the cause of religion,
philanthropy, and science, we desire to testify our respect for the exalted
worth and serupulous conscientiousness which Dr. Parker brought to
the discharge of every duty, and which during his connection with the
government of this Institution were nobly exemplified by the zeal and
diligence with which he ever watched and worked for its prosperity and
usefulness, even during the later period of his honorable service, when
the burden of years was added to the burden of official cares, and when
with a less conscientious sense of public duty he might have claimed
an exemption from the tasks of life.

DR. CHARLES RAU, CURATOR OF ANTIQUITIES.

Dr. Charles Rau, for many years in charge of the department of an-
tiquities in the National Museum, was born in Belgium in 1826. He
lived for a time in Germany and as a political exile came to America
thirty years ago, landing at New Orleans December 23, 1848; lived for
a time in Saint Louis; engaged in teaching at Belleville, Il., and later
went to New York City, still occupied as a teacher of languages. He
had always been a deeply interested student of aboriginal remains, and
had written many articles on the prehistoric condition of man. In 1875
he had charge of an exhibition of North American archeology for the
display of the Institution in the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia.

He was in 1881 appointed curator of the department of antiquities
in the National Museum. His health gave way in 1886, and in July,
1887, he went to the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where
he died on the 25th of July. His body was brought to Washington and
was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, where a modest grave-stone bearing
a suitable inscription has been erected to his memory.
oF REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

He bequeathed to the National Museum his library, consisting of 715
bound volumes, and 1,722 volumes unbound; his archwologiea: collec-
tion comprising 1,920 specimens (ethnologic) and his collection of
minerals and fossils.

These objects have been transferred to the Museum by his adminis-
trator, Mr. Thomas Wilson. The books comprising the library are being
arranged and catalogued, and will form the nucleus of a departmental
library. The archeological specimens will be kept together and dis-
played under the name of their donor. Almost the eutire life of Dr.
Rau was spent in archzeologic studies. He was faithful, zealous, and
devoted to science. He had the courage of his convictions and was
ready to defend them before any person or tribunal, however august.
He did what he could for the alleviation of human suffering and regret-
ted he could not do more. The fruits of his scientific labors will be de-
seribed in the Bibliographical Appendix to the Report of the National
Museum in Part II of this Report. —

In addition to the above, mention should be made of the deaths of
the following employés of the Institution:

On June 8, 1888, Charles Wickliffe Beckham, formerly an assistant
in the Department of Birds, died at his home near Bardstown, Ky. He
had made several valuable contributions to American ornithological
literature.

Mrs. L. S. Weaver, clerk and translator, died November 26, 1887.
She had been employed in the Institution since 1876, having been ap-
pointed upon the death of her first husband, L. Stoerzer, at that time
chief taxidermist; and she rendered always willing and efficient service.

Capt. C. W. C. Dunnington, a respected citizen of Washington, for
several years a watchman in the Museum, Frederick R. Parker, a clerk
in the Institution, and Isaac Diggs, for twenty years a laborer and at-
tendant, have also died during the year.

The following notice of Dr. Emil Bessels has been supplied by Dr.
Dall:

Dr. Emil Bessels was born in Heidelberg, June 2, 1847. Educated at
the University, and securing the degree of doctor in medicine, he was
more disposed toward science and belles-lettres than to the practice of
his profession. Being in easy circumstances he was enabled to follow his
natural bent, and for a time was a student in zoology under Van Bene-
den, and an assistant of Krauss at the Naturalien Cabinet, or Royal
Museum of Wiirtemberg in Stuttgart. He became interested in Arctic
discovery, and his first essay in this direction, under the encouragement
of Petermann, of Gotha, was the well-known voyage of 1369 into the
{

q

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

sea between Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla. By his observations on
this journey he traced the influence of the Gulf Stream water east of
Spitzbergen and added much to the scanty knowledge of this region
then available. In 1870 he was called to the field as military surgeon,
rendering services in the hospitals, which brought him a public com-
mendation from the Grand Duke of Baden. In 1871 he came to America
at Petermann’s suggestion to join Hall’s Polar Expedition as naturalist
and surgeon. Most of the scientific results of this voyage were the fruit
of his personal efforts. After the rescue of the survivors he returned
to America, where for some years he was busy at the Smithsonian In-
stitution in preparing for publication the scientific results of the voy-
age, one of the most striking of which was the proof first brought out
by him of the insularity of Greenland, which he deduced from the tidal
observations secured on the expedition. In 1876 his work was printed
in quarto, under the title of “Report on the Scientific Results of the
Polaris Expedition.” Three years later he published through Engle-
mann, at Leipzig, a German narrative of the expedition, illustrated
largely from his own very artistic sketches. He projected a work on the
Eskimo, to which he devoted much labor. An ethnological voyage
undertaken on the United States steamer Saranac to the northwest
coast of America was prematurely terminated by the wreck of that
vessel in Seymour Narrows, British Columbia. He returned to Wash-
ington, where he prepared several contributions to Arctic and zoolog-
ical literature. Through an unfortunate fire at his residence he lost his
library, manuscripts, and collections in 1885, and subsequently returned
to Germany, where he settled at Stuttgart. Here he was engaged in
literary pursuits, the study of art, and in geographical instruction.
He died after a short illness, March 30, 1888, and his remains were in-
terred in the Cemetery, at Heidelberg.
Respectfully submitted.

Secretary of Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT,

APPENDIX I.

PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[Presented in the First Annual Report of the Secretary, and adopted by the Board of Regents, De-
cember 13, 1847.]

INTRODUCTION.—General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a
plan of organization.

1. Will of Smithson. The property is bequeathed to the United States of America
“to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an estab-
lishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The Government of the United States
is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently supposed, but
the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and perpetuate his name.

4. The objects of the Institution are (1) to increase, and (2) to diffuse knowledge
among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another. The first is to
enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition of new truths; and the
second, to disseminate knowledge, thus increased, among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of knowledge;
hence al] branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating and promoting
the discovery of new truths; and can be most extensively diffused among men by
means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should be such as to
enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of increasing and diffusing
knowledge, which can not be produced either at all or so efficiently by the existing
institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provisionally, can be
easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or be abandoned, in whole or in part,
without a sacrifice of the funds.

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time occasioned by the
delay of eight years in establishing the Institution, a considerable portion of the in-
terest which has accrued should be added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated, the funds are
small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the construction of the building ;
and not only the first cost of the edifice should be considered, but also the continual
expense of keeping it in repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily
connected with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently supported
by the Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined by the plan of
the organization, and not the converse.

95
96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be benefited by the be-
quest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure on local objects would be a
perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from the will of
Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of the act of Congress estab-
lishing the Institution. These are, a library, a museum, and a gallery of art, witha
building on a liberal scale to contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing deduc-
tions from the will of Smithson,

To increase knowledge : It proposed (1) to stimulate men of talent to make original
researches, by offering suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths ; and (2)
to appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular researches, under the
direction of suitable persons.

To diffuse knowledge: It is proposed (1) to publish a series of periodical reports on
the progress of the different branches of knowledge; and (2) to publish occasionally
separate treatises on subjectsof general interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.

I. By stimulating researches.—1. Facilities afforded for the production of original
memoirs on all branches of knowledge. 2 The memoirs thus obtained to be pub-
lished ina series of volumes, in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contribu-
tions to Knowledge. 3. No memoir, on subjects of physical science, to be accepted
for publication, which does not furnish a positive addition to human knowledge, rest-
ing on original research ; and all unverified speculations to be rejected. 4. Each me-
moir presented to the Institution to be submitted for examination to a commission of
persons of reputation for learning in the branch to which the memoir pertains ; and to
be accepted for publication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.
5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution, and the name of the
author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a favorable decision be made. 6. The
volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions of literary and scientific
societies, and copies to be given to all the colleges and principal libraries in this
country. One part of the remaining copies may be offered for sale; and the other

institutions. 7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Sy’
DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I. By the publication of a series of reports giving an account of the new discoveries in
science, and of the changes made from year to year in all branches of knowledge not strictly
professional.—l. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally interesting,
but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the reports may be pub-
lished annually, others at longer intervals, as the income of the Institution or the
changes in the branches of knowledge may indicate. 2. The reports are to be prepared
by collaborators eminent in the different branches of knowledge. 3. Each collabo-
rator to be furnished with the journals and publications, domestic and foreign, nec-
essary to the compilation of his report; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and
to be named on the title-page of the report. 4. The reports to be published in sepa-
rate parts, so that persons interested in a particular branch can procure the parts
relating to it without purchasing the whole. 5. These reports may be presented to
Congress for partial distribution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and
scientific institutions and sold to individuals for a moderate price.*

Il. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.—1. These
treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs translated from foreign lan-
guages, or of articles prepared under the direction of the Institution, or procured by
offering premiums for the best exposition of a given subject. 2. The treatises should,
in all cases, be submitted to a commission of competent judges previous to their pub-
lication. 3. Asexamples of these treatises, expositions may be obtaived of the present
state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of the Board
of Regents, providing for the two modes of increasing and diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated the formation of a
library and a museum, and the Board of Regents, including these objects in the plan
of organization, resolved to divide the income into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge by means of pub-
lications and researches, agreeably to the scheme before given. The other part to be
appropriated to the formation of a library and a collection of objects of nature and
of art,

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required, consisting,
first, of a complete collection of the transactions and proceedings of ail the learned
societies in the world; second, of the more important current periodical publications
and other works necessary in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of objects to illus-
trate and verify its own publications. ;

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of experimental

science.

~ *The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in the reports:
I. Physical Class.—(1) Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,

and meteorology. (2) Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, ete. (3)

Agriculture. (4) Application of science to arts.

TL. Moral and Political Class.—(5) Ethnology, including particular history, com-

parative philology, antiquities, ete. (6) Statistics and politicaleconomy. (7) Mental

and moral philosophy. (8) A survey of the political events of the world, penal re-

form, ete. A

Ill. Literature and the Fine Arts.—(9) Modern literature. (10) The fine arts, and
their application to the useful arts, (11) Bibliography, (12) Obituary notices of
flistinguished individuals.

98 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those mentioned above,
catalogues of all the different libraries in the United States should be procured, in
order that the valuable books first purchased may be such as are not to be found in
the United States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials, should be col-
lected for rendering the Institution a center of bibliographical knowledge, whence
the student may be directed to any work which he may require.

9, It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase by donation as
rapidly as the income of the Institution can make provision for their reception, and
therefore it will seldom be necessary to purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts of the most
celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of expense, for the exhi-
bition of the objects of the Art Union and other similar societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of antiquities, such
as those of the remains of ancient temples, etc.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, besides the Secretary,
no permanent assistant will be required, except one to act as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to the Regents. He
shall take charge of the building and property, keep a record of proceedings, dis-
charge the duties of librarian and keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent
of the Regents, employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress, will be required
to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit new objects of art; distin-
guished individuals should also be invited to give lectures on subjects of general in-
terest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has become the settled
policy of the Institution. The only material change is that expressed by the follow-
ing resolutions, adopted January 15, 1855, viz:

Resolved, That the seventh resolution passed by the Board of Regents on the 26th
of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the income between the active opera-
tions and the museum and library, when the buildings are completed, be, and it is
hereby, repealed.

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be apportioned specifically
among the different objects and operations of the Institution in such manner as may,
in the judgmens of the Regents, be necessary and proper for each, according to its
intrinsic importance, and a compliance in good faith with the law.

[Resolution of Board of Regents, adopted January 17, 1880, and at each successive annual meeting. |

Tesolved, That the income for the year be appropriated for the service of the In&ti-
tution upon the basis of the report [of the Executive Committee], to be expended
by the Secretary, with full discretion as to the items, subject to the approval of the
Executive Committee.
APPENDIX II.

PUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAR.
SMITHSONIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.

Of this series, no work has been published during the past year. A memoir on the
archeolegy of North America has been for several years in course of preparation by
Dr. Charles Rau, the late curator of the department of Pre-historic Antiquities, and
several thousand dollars have been expended in the production ef drawings by Mr.
C. F. Trill and others, under Dr. Rau’s direction, for the purpose of properly illus-
trating the work. Dr. Rau’s illness at the beginning of the past fiscal year, and his
death in July, 1887, have arrested the progress of this undertaking. The unfinished
work will, however, be taken up by his successor, Mr. Thomas Wilson, and prosecuted
to an early completion, and it is not improbable that this work may be published in
the above series.

SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

Of this series three volumes have been published duripg the year, besides several
independent treatises. Taking these in the order in which they appear in the printed
lists, they are as follows:

591. ‘‘Synoptical Flora of North America: The Gamopetalie ; being a second edition
of Vol.1, Part u, and Vol. 11, Part 1, collected,” by Asa Gray, LL. D. Of these two
portions, the earlier—the last part of the proposed first volume—comprises 480 pages,
and the latter—being the commencing part of the proposed second volume—com-
prises 494 pages; forming in the aggregate, with introductory matter, an octavo vol-
ume of 986 pages. As long as forty years-ago, Dr. Gray, in co-operation with Dr.
Torrey, undertook a comprehensive classification of the North American flora, which,
however, never was completed, stopping with a synopsis of the polypetalous, and
about half the gamopetalous divisions of the Dicotyledons, or to the close of the
order of Composite. Ambitious of reconstructing and completing the long contem-
plated work, Dr. Gray, postponing the first part of Vol. 1 (the Polypetala), has taken
up, for the second part of the volume, the Gamopetala as far as the completion of the
Composite, and has continued the remaining orders of the Gamopetalw as the first
part of the succeeding volume. The lamented death of the author has left his great
work still unfinished; the third division of the Dicotyledons (the dpetale), and the
Monoctyledons having been designed to form the second part of Vol. 1. The present
two detached portions of successive volumes, however, have a unity in being occupied
entirely with the Gamopelala, and they constitute a full and systematic descriptive
catalogue or synopsis of this great division.

Several thousand dollars have been expended by the Institution in furthering this
important botanical work, which probably cost the author nearly as much more. In
consideration of this, Dr. Gray was allowed to issue for his own benefit a first edition
of the work of 500 copies before the Institution attempted to publish its own edition,
which bas thus only lately appeared.

“Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. xxx1.” This volume is occupied with the two
parts of the “ Flora of North America,” by Dr. Asa Gray, just described ; a separate
edition of 500 copies of the work having been issued as ‘‘No, 591,” for special dis~

tribution, according to the long-established policy of the Institution, and an edition
of 1,000 copies being issued as a numbered volume of the ‘‘ Collections,” for deposit
with the principal libraries and scientific societies of the world.

658. “‘Index to the Literature of the Spectroscope,” by Alfred Tuckerman. This
bibliography is designed to give a list of all the books and smaller treatises, espe-
cially contributions to scientific periodicals, on the spectroscope and spectrum an-
alysis from the beginning of our knowledge upon the subject until July, 1887. The
work is arranged as an alphabetical index to topics as well as of substances which
have been spectroscopically examined, followed by an alphabetical list of the authors.
It comprises 3,829 titles and the names of 799 authors, and forms an octavo volume of
433 pages, including introductory matter and supplement.

659. “‘A Table of Specific Gravity for Solids and Liquids (new edition, revised and
enlarged),” by Frank Wigglesworth Clark. This work is a revised edition, entirely
re-written, of specific gravity tables, by the same author, published by this Institu-
tion December, 1873, and a supplement to the same, published April, 1876. ‘The
melting and boiling temperature appended to many of the substances in these earlier
tables have been omitted in the present. A general idea of the expansion given to
this important series of density determinations may be suggested by the statement
that the original work gave a list of 2,263 different substances, to which the supple-
ment added nearly 700 more, while the present work presents a list of 5,227 distinct
substances. And as many of the substances have had their specific. gravities inde-
pendently investigated by several eminent chemists, with slight variations in their
results, it may be well to add that the tables actually include 14,465 separate deter-
minations of these constants, averaging about two and three-fourths independent ex-
aminations to every substance catalogued. The large mass of material thus ex-
hibited furnishes a creditable record, both of the rapid extension of minute chemical
investigation in the last dozen years and of the diligence of the present compiler, Mr.
Clark, who has himself, moreover, done very meritorious work in the direction of
specific gravity determinations.

The work forms an octavo volume of 417 pages in all, and it is under consideration
whether it may not be well, in view of the interest of chemists in the table and the
demand for them, to put the sale copies in the hand of a publisher.

660. ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collections,” Vol. xxx. This volume is made up of the
two works last mentioned, in the order, first, Clark’s Table of Specific Gravity ; second,
Tuckerman’s Bibliography of Spectroscopic Analysis. It forms an octavo volume of
855 pages.

661. ‘‘ Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington,” Vols. 1x, x. Contain-
ing the minutes of the society and of the mathematical section for the years 1886,
1887, together with the proceedings of the Baird memorial meeting, held January 11,
1888. ‘The bulletin for these two years forms an octavo volume of 376 pages, embel-
lished with a phototype likeness of Professor Baird.

662. ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collections,” Vol. xxx111. This volume consists entirely of
the bulletins of the Philosophical Society of Washington, and is made up of No. 543.
Bulletin, Vol. vi, for the year 1883; No. 592, Bulletin, Vol. vu, for the year 1884; No.
636, Bulletin, Vol. vim, for the year 1885, and No. 661, just previously described,
Bulletin, Vol. 1x, for 1886, and Vol. x, for 1887. The following note is appended to
the general table of contents on page 5: ‘‘ With this volume (containing the last five
volumes of the bulletins of the Philosophical Society of Washington) is terminated
the re-issue of these proceedings in the series of Miscellaneous Collections. It may
be stated that volumes 1, 2, and 3 of these bulletins formed Vol. xx of the Miscella-
neous Collections; volumes 4 and 5 were included in Vol. xxv of the Miscellaneous
Collections; and, lastly, volumes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, together with the Memorial Pro-
ceedings in honor of Professor Baird, and a full index of the whole ten volumes, con-
stitute the present Vol. xxx11i of the Miscellaneous Collections.” This last forms in
all an octavo volume of 910 pages, with several wood-cuts and one plate portrait.

SMITHSONIAN ANNUAL REPORT.

654. ‘‘Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,” 1885,
Part 11. This second part, being the report of the United States National Museum
to July, 1885, has at last been received from the Government Printing Office, more
than a year later than the first part of the report for the same period, which related
to the operations of the Smithsonian Institution proper. This long-delayed Part 11
consists of five sections: The first being the ‘‘ Report upon the Condition and Progress
of the U. S. National Museum during the half year ending June 30, 1885,” by G.
Brown Goode, assistant director, and occupying the first 54 pages of the work.
The second, ‘‘ Reports of the Curators and Acting Curators of the Museum upon the
Progress of their Work” during the period, occupying pages 55 to 146, The third,
a “ Bibliography of the Museum” during the period, including the publications of
the Museum and those of its officers and others relative to the museum material, and
occupying pages 149 to 173. The fourth, a ‘“ List of Accessions to the Museum” dur-
ing the period, together with descriptive notes and indices, occupying pages 175 to
243. The fifth, an appendix, consisting of a very full description of the ‘‘George
Catlin Indian Gallery in the Museum, with memoir and statistics,” by Thomas Don-
aldson, occupying 939 pages, illustrated by 142 plates and maps. This historical
sketch (forming the greater portion of the volume) has proved to be in great popular
demand, the applications made for it through Members of Congress having been un-
usually numerous, so that our stock of 7,000 copies is already nearly exhausted. The
whole number of pages of this Part 1 of the report, including introductory matter
and indices, is 1,220. If to this be added the illustrations, the aggregate would be
equal to 1,500 octavo pages.

657. ‘‘ Report of Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
for the year 1886~87.” his last report of my lamented predecessor forms an
octavo pamphlet of 27 pages. The volume to contain the above report, with its ac-
companying papers and general appendix, has not yet been set up at the Govern-
ment Printing Office. :

ISSUES OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

655. ‘‘ Proceedings of the United States National Museum, Vol. rx, 1886.” As
already stated, this series, though primarily published at the expense of the Govern-
ment by the authority of the Interior Department, has heretofore been re-issued by
the Smithsonian Institution. The present volume, completed and collected during
the past year, consists of descriptive papers by James E. Benedict, T. W. Blackiston,
George H. Boehmer, Charles H. Bollman, E. D. Cope, W. H. Dall, George E. Doering,
Charles L. Edwards, Carl H. Eigenmann, Barton W. Evermann, Fernando Ferari-
Perez, Morton W. Fordyce, Elizabeth G. Hughes, David S. Jordan, George N. Law-
rence, John Belknap Marcon, William G. Masyk, George P. Merrill, Richard Rathbun,
Robert Ridgway, John A. Rider, John B. Smith, Rosa Smith, Leonard Steineger,
Frederick W. True, and John Grant Wells. The collection forms an octavo volume
of 720 pages, including introduction and index, and is illustrated by 25 plates, of
which one is a chromo-lithograph.

565. ‘Bulletin of the United States National Museum, No. 32.” This work is a
Catalogue of Batrachians and Reptiles of Central America and Mexico, by E. D. Cope.
The systematic catalogue is very largely based on the specimens contained in the
National Museum. To each species is added a list of the localities at which it has
been discovered, together with the name of the discoverer, or, in the absence of that,
with the name of the author who is responsible for the correctness of the locality.
The total number of genera included in the catalogue is 197, and of species 705, of
which 135 are Batrachians and 570 Reptilians. The Bulletin forms a pamphlet of 98
octavo pages.

STEREOTYPE PLATES ON HAND.

For many years the greater portion of the stereotype plates of Smithsonian pub-

lications has been stored in Philadelphia, in the fire-proof vaults of the Academy of
102 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Natural Sciences, generously offered for that purpose. There having been no safe
depository here for them, and much of the printing having been done in Philadelphia,
the plates have been allowed to remain there undisturbed.

As the institution now has suitable store-rooms entirely fire-proof, and it is found
that new editions of works can be printed to better advantage in this city, thereby
avoiding the cost of transportation of the whole editions of publications, it is pro-
posed to bring all these plates together in one depository—the basement of the
Smithsonian Building. A

It is to be regretted that the early volumes of ‘‘Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge” were not stereotyped, and thus that it is impossible at the present time
to reproduce full sets.

The plates of the annual reports from 1862 to 1886 (twenty-five years) are in pos-
session of the Institution; and if supplies should be wanted for libraries or individ-
uals, an edition might at any time be ordered by Congress, at the mere cost of paper
and press-work.
APPENDIX III.

REPORT UPON INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.

By J. H. Kipper, Curator.

The business of the exchange office has increased during the year, as shown by the
following table:

| |
1886-’87. | 1887-’88. | Increase.

or over 40 per cent. more packages were handled than during the previous year. This
large increase is partly offset by the fact that an unusually large number of the pack-
ages received during the year just passed were single publications and of small size.
The business of the office is set forth in detail by Exhibit A, hereto appended.

EXPENSE.

The expense of the service for the fiscal year has been $15,113.75, of which sum
$12,000 were voted by Congress for the support of the ‘international exchanges
with foreign countries,” and $205.75 were refunded by the Patent Office, Signal Of-
fice, and a correspondent in South America, leaving a net deficit of $2,908, which has
been paid from the Smithsonian fund.

The expenditure for the fiscal year 1888~89 at the present rate, making no allow-
ance for increase in the business of the office or in the pay of its employés, will be
$16,050. If the amount estimated for Jast October, $15,000, shall be voted by Con-
gress, there will be a deficit at the end of the year of at least $1,050, to be paid by
the Smithsonian fund. Considering the probability that the business of the office
will continue to increase during the next fiscal year, I think it reasonable to expect
that the deficit will amount to as much as $2,000 by the 30th of June, 1889.

RE-IMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.

In former years a part of the deficit in the expense of transportation has been re-
paid to the Smithsonian Institution by the different departments and bureaus of the
Government, to which occasional appropriations have been granted by Congress for
the purpose. During the past year such payments have been made by the Signal
Office and Patent Office, but only of a part of their indebtedness, the usnal appro-
priations to other bureaus having been omitted. The Institution has, therefore, de-
sisted from sending bills during the year to offices of the National Government, bal-

By the terms of the pending sundry civil bill for the year ending June 30, 1889,
the Geological Survey will have an appropriation of $5,000 ‘‘ for the purchase of neces-
sary books for the library, and the payment for the transmission of public documents
through the Smithsonian exchange.” Other appropriations of a similar purport are to
the Signal Office ‘‘for exnenses * * * of prepaying, printing, distributing, and
displaying weather maps, etc., $15,000,” and to the War Department ‘for the trans-
portation of charts and maps to foreign countries through the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, $100.” By the legislative and executive bill it is proposed to appropriate to the
Naval Observatory ‘‘for payment to the Smithsonian Institution for freight on Ob-
servatory publications sent to foreign countries, $136,” and to the Library of Con-
gress ‘‘for expenses of exchanging public documents for the publications of foreign
governments, $1,500.” By the same act an indefinite part of an appropriation of $3,000
to the Patent Office is ‘‘ for the purchase of books and expenses of transporting pub-
lications of patents issued by the Patent Office to foreign governments,” and a simi-
lar appropriation of $2,000 to the Bureau of Edueation is ‘for the distribution and
exchange of educational documents,” among other purposes.

It appears then to have been the intention of Congress that its specific appropria-
tion for the exchange business shall be supplemented by special appropriations to
some of the bureaus and departments of the Government, so that the charge of 5 cents
per pound weight, imposed by the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution in 1878,
may be met by them.

It is my opinion, and I therefore respectfully recommend, that this procedure,
which had become necessary at the time of its original adoption by reason of the
heavy annual expense of the exchanges to the Smithsonian fund, is no longer ad-
vantageous or economical and may wisely be discontinued. The average annual
amount collected in this way between the years 1878 and 1887 was about $1,650. Al-
lowing for the increased business of later years $2,000 should be added to the annual
appropriation for Exchanges. The expense to the Government would be no greater
than it now is, while the entire cost of the Exchanges would appear in a single ap-
propriation. By the present system the cost of the service is actualiy larger than ap-
pears in the specific appropriation for Exchanges, and as the special appropriations to
the different departments of the Government vary from year to year, and are often
omitted altogether, an uncertain burden, which can not be accurately foreseen, is
imposed upon the Smithsonian fund.

CORRESPONDENTS.

The number of correspondents has been increased during the year by 1,721 new
names. There have been 100 losses by deaths 6f individuals or discontinuance of
organizations.

The additions are classified as follows:

GRAND DUCHY OF BADEN.

The Grand Duchy of Baden was one of the governments which were the first to
accede to the proposition for international exchanges conveyed by Professor Henry’s
circular letter dated May 16, 1867, and two cases were shipped to Karlsruhe through
the Smithsonian agent at Leipzig,on tbe i3th of June, 1873. After that time ex-
changes with Baden were discontinued until the visit of Mr. George H. Boehmer,
special agent of the Exchange Office and of the National Library, to Kurope in 1884.
Mr. Boehmer succeeded in procuring from the Government of the Grand Duchy a set
of the statutes (Official Gazette) from 1803 to 1885, and the proceedings of the Diet
since 1849. Continuations of these series were shipped by the Government of Baden in
August, 1887, and in February, 1888, Baden was again added to the list of governments
receiving official international exchanges. ‘Twenty-four boxes were sent thither on
the 29th of February, 1888, and three shipments have been made since that time.

The number of Governments now taking part with the United States in these of-
ficial exchanges is 41, as follows:

Argentine Republic, Engtand, Prussia,
Austria, Greece, Queensland,
Baden, Hayti, Russia,
Bavaria, Holland, Saxony,
Belgium, Hungary, South Australia,
Buenos Ayres, India, Spain,
Brazil, Italy, Sweden,
Canada (Ottawa), Japan, Switzerland,
Canada (Toronto), Mexico, Tasmania,
Chili, - New South Wales, Turkey,
Colombia, United States of, | New Zealand, Venezuela,
Denmark, Norway, Victoria,
France, Peru, Wurtemberg.
North German Empire, Portugal,

It will be observed that several of these Governments are provincial or subordinate
members of an empire, kingdom, or republic.

Of this number only seven, to wit, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Servia, Spain,
and Switzerland, have acceded to the first of the two conventions, based upon a con-
ference of representatives of different Governments at Brussels in 1886, and now pend-
ing before the Senate of the United States. *

The first of the two conventions relates te the ‘‘ International Exchange of official
documents and scientific publications; ” the second, to the ‘immediate exchange of
the daily official journals” of legislative assemblies.

To this second convention only six nations besides the United States have acceded,
Switzerland withdrawing.

These conventions have been brought about mainly through the active interest of
the Government of Belgium in the success and extension of the international exchange
system. The history of the present agreements is of some interest in this connection,
aud has been set forth at length by Mr. George H. Boehmer in prev ious reports (see

106 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

especially Secretary’s Reports for 1881, 1883, and 1887). It may be briefly summarized,
as follows:

The delegates to the International Geographic Congress, which met at Paris in 1875,
who were for the most part the dipiomatic representatives of the Governments par-
ticipating, passed a unanimous resolution, on the 12th of August, pledging themselves
to request their Governments each to establish a bureau of International Exchanges;
and on the 29th of January, 1876, those delegates who remained in Paris prepared
and signed a set of rules for the management of the exchange business. At this time
the ‘Bureau des Echanges” was established in Paris, under the direction of the_
Baron de Vatteville, and the rules agreed upon by the delegates and issued by this
bureau were generally accepted by the Governments concerned, but no ratifications
or other formal and international agreements were exchanged. England and Ger-
many refused from the first to participate in either conferences or conventions relat-
ing to international exchanges.

With the hope of bringing about a more formal agreement, which should have the
force and obligation of a treaty, the Government of Belgium called another conference,
which met at Brussels in 1850, but at which the United States was not represented.
This conference prepared an amended agreement for future consideration.

In the year 1883 (April 10) there was another, more formal, conference at Brussels,
at which this country was represented by Mr. Nicholas Fish, the United States min-
ister resident. By this conference the articles prepared by the meeting of 1580 were
revised and further amended. At the instance of France the exchange bureaus were
relieved from the duty of collecting official publications from the several depart-
mental offices for transmission. The articles, as amended, were agreed to by the rep-
resentative of the United States. A second special agreement was also drawn up,
providing for the immediate transmission of parliamentary journals, annals, and pub-
lic documents, which the representative of the United States refused to sign. A
protocol, signed by all the powers represented, stated the purpose of the proposed
conventions to be (1) the collection into a national library of each country of all
official publications of every other; and (2) as many literary, scientific, and art
publications as the bureaus could procure.

The articles agreed upon in 1883 were signed at a third Brussels conference in 1886,
and on this occasion the representative of the United States, Mr. Lambert Tree, the
minister resident, signed the additional convention providing for the immediate
transmission of parliamentary daily journals, ete., which his predecessor had rejected
in 1883. At this time France declined to participate further in the conferences, Eng-
land and Germany still persisting in their refusal. As already stated, only seven
Governments besides the United States have acceded to the general convention for
international exchanges, and only six to the special agreement for the immediate
exchange of the daily journals of legislative assemblies. With the thirty-four other
Governments which take part in the international official exchanges this friendly
commerce will probably continue in the future as it has in the past, upon the basis of
mutual agreements between the parties concerned, but without the sanction or com-
pulsion of treaty obligations. ;

The principal advantage accruing from these several conferences and conventions
has been the establishment of a certain uniformity of procedure in the transactions
of the exchange business by the agents of the countries interested.

The conventions themselves do not promise any definite improvement in the present
system, from the point of view held by the Smithsonian Institution, the main stipu-
lations for which it has contended not having been retained in the agreements now
under consideration. These are, as stated by Professor Henry (circular letter dated
May 16, 1867), and by Professor Baird (letter to Baron de Vatteville, dated February
8, 1579), that each exchange agency shall, (1) furnish an annual list of all the offi-
cial publications of its Government, and (2) shall charge itself with the collection and
forwarding of such publications. These provisions appeared in the agreement of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 107

1875, the authorship of which is attributed principally to the representatives of
France; were stricken out of the amended articles considered in 1883 at the in-
stance of France; and in 1886 that Government declined to take further part in the
conference.

It is, in fact, scarcely possible for the exchange offices of most foreign countries to
procure all of the official publications of their Governments for exchange purposes,
the publishing arrangements of the governmental departments being for the most
part quite separate and distinct from one another, and there being no law, except in
the United States and Belgium, requiring them to furnish copies for this purpose. It
is indeed extremely difficult even for the exchange agent of a Goverment to ascer-
tain what the official publications of the different departments and bureaus are.

The text of the two conventions as finally agreed to by the conference of 1886 is
presented herewith as Exhibit B.

During the past year some unusual pains have been taken in the efforts to increase
the number of official publications received from foreign countries, it appearing that
the United States Government now sends out about twenty times as many packages
to other Governments as it receives from them, and that this disproportion has been
annually on the increase for several years past. (See Exhibit C.) With some diffi-
culty and at the cost of much correspondence a list, still not complete, of French
official publications has been compiled, containing four hundred and twenty-one titles.
Of these the library of the Smithsonian Institution received during the calendar
year 1887 thirty-nine titles and the National Library forty-one titles.

During the fiscal year 1887~’88 three shipments were received from the French Bu-
reau des Echanges, on the 6th of June and the 8th of December, 1887, and the 12th of
April, 1888, containing nine official packages for the Library of Congress. The num-
ber of titles contained in these nine packages can not now be precisely stated, but
was probably not greater than that received during the calendar year.

On the other hand, there were four shipments of official publications to France
from this country during the fiscal year, containing seven hundred and sixty-three
packages of official publications.

What has just been said relates only to the international exchange of official publica-
tions, intended for the national libraries of the Governments participating. By far
the larger part of all of the business of this office is actually governmental business,
a considerable proportion of the so-called ‘‘ literary and scientific ” exchanges being
really an exchange of official publications between the bureaus or official subdivis-
ions of the different Governments, for the benetit of the bureau libraries, and not for
that of central or national libraries, as contemplated by the international agreements
already referred to (Exhibit B). *

Most of the foreign Government bureaus, and of our own as well, desire to enrich
their individual libraries, and do not regard the deposit of one set of the publications

*These publications are as strictly a part of the “official or governmental ” ex-
changes as are those provided for by the resolution of Congress granting fifty copies for
foreign national libraries. While, therefore, long usage has sanctioned the designations
“literary and scientific” and ‘ official,” in the sense explained above, I think that in
the interest of convenience and intelligibility, hereafter if will be better to express
simply the distinction which really exists, namely, that between the official and un-
official exchanges, by the adjections ‘“ governmental” and ‘‘ miscellaneous ;”” meaning
by the former all publications sent or received by the Government or its bureans, and
by the latter all others. The publications of the Smithsonian Institution, which
are partly “ governmental” and partly ‘‘ miscellaneous,” although divided so far as
the exchange records and statistics are concerned, are accounted for as a whole by
the office routine of the Institution. Iam not aware of any other oflice or organiza-
tion whose publications would not fall wholly within one or the other of these
classes.
108 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
of other countries in the national library as an equivalent for some forty copies of their
own publications.

If the clauses proposed by the Paris conference of 1875, and always urged by the
Smithsonian Institution, requiring the preparation and exchange of annual lists of
all official publications, and that all of those named in the lists should be furnished
to each of the contracting parties, had been retained in the convention of 1886, and if
the convention could be faithfully executed, an effective remedy for the shortcomings
already indicated might have been found. The opposition of some of the Governments
participating in the conferences however (notably France and Switzerland), and
the final withdrawal of France and continued indifference of England and Germany,
have made this remedy impossible. Something has been done during the past year,
by perservering correspondence, and more may doubtless be effected hereafter in the
same way, but the most promising plan yet tried has been the employment of a
special agent to visit the European (as the most important) Government offices, and
excite there an interest in the subject by personal explanation and argument. Mr.
George H. Boehmer, of this office, was employed in this way in 1884, as has been already
stated, with the result of mnch larger receipts than have been shown by any one
year before or since. After Mr. Boehmer’s return, however, the temporary interest
which his mission had excited rapidly weakened. Many sets of publications which
had been freely promised him (notably a complete set of the publications of the
British Government) have not been sent, mainly because of indifference, and of the
considerable labor and time required for preparing the sets for shipment.

It is not only foreign Governments, however, which show shortcomings in this
matter. According to Hickox’ monthly catalogue of Government publications, there
were issued by the National Government and its bureaus, during the first six months
of the year 1888, about eleven hundred separate titles, not considering single laws
or articles forming parts of reports as distinct publications. While it is not possi-
ble until the volumes of Executive Documents, Miscellaneous Documents, and Re-
ports have been finally collected and bound, to state precisely the number of sepa-
rate volumes as finally distributed, it is safe to say that the total number for the six
months was greatly in excess of the number of titles furnished for official exchanges.
Of all the Executive Departments, for example, only the Light-House Board and the
Signal Office furnished a part of their publications for this purpose.

The total number of separate titles furnished by the Public Printer during the six
months for which this comparison is drawn was two hundred and ninety-five, includ-
ing a considerable number of Army orders, reports of contested-election cases, and
other matter not of a kind most valuable to foreign Jibraries. Such a comparison as
this can, however, only be regarded as illustrative, since the publications furnished
by the Public Printer are always at least a year old at the time of distribution.

The resolution of Congress, passed July 25, 1868, directing that fifty copies of every
Government publication and every publication issued under the direction of the Gov-
ernment, shall be placed at the disposal of the joint committee of Congress on the Li-
brary for the purpose of the international exchanges, is sufficiently mandatory in its
provisions, but, as above stated, has never been fully carried out. Eftorts have been
made from time to time by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and the Libra-
rian of Congress, with the assistance and support of the State Department and of mem-
bers of both branches of Congress, which have beep set forth at length in the reports
on exchanges attached to the Secretary’s reports for 1886 and 1887. Iam pleased to
be able to report that the receipts from the Public Printer during the last six months
of the year, far as they fall short of the full and complete distribution contemplated
by the law, show a decided increase over the number of titles received and shipped
in previous months and years. The resolution is recited in Exhibit D, hereto ap-
pended.

As I have already said, it is not easy to get data for complete lists of the official
publications of foreign countries, since they have not, tomy knowledge, been brought
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 109

together in a single catalogue by any government. Such lists are now in course of
preparation by this office, and in April last a special card catalogue was begun of the
titles of all foreign official publications which passed through the exchange office, so
that by the end of another year it will be possible to state with some certainty which
official publications each government gives to the international exchanges and which
it withholds.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

Upon assuming general control of the office (March 19, 1888), I found that complaints
and criticisms of the efficiency of the exchange system by individuals, societies, and
Government bureaus were not infrequent. In some instances packages from abroad,
notification of the shipment of which had been long ago received, had not been de-
livered ; in others, packages sent hence had failed to reach their destination or had
been unreasonably delayed. Every such complaint has been promptly and diligently
followed up by correspondence, with the result, in all but three instances thus far,
of tracing the missing package and explaining the delay. It has happened, rather
surprisingly often, that the receipt of the complaining correspondent for the package
he writes of is on file in this office, having been signed by some assistant in his ab-
sence, or by himself and forgotten. In the three cases not yet settled no reply has
yet been received from the distributing agencies to which inquiries have been ad-
dressed.

The fact remains, however, that there have been and are still too many and too great
delays in the transmission of exchange matter from its place of shipment to its des-
tination, and for this state of things there are several reasons.

In the first place, delays occur in this office in forwarding packages addressed to
countries which receive and send but few publications (such as Hawaii, Hayti, and
many of the Central American republics), until a sufficient nnmber has accumulated
to fill one of the ordinary boxes. If these packages should be forwarded as soon as
they are received the expense would be greater than the resources of the exchange
service could bear. But the most serious delays occur in the exchange bureaus of
other countries. For example, in a recent experimental shipment to London, Leip-
zig, and Paris, the boxes having been shipped on the same day and accompanied by
letters asking for immediate acknowledgments, the agents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution at London and Leipzig reported receipt in fourteen and fifteen days, respect-
ively, and the Bureau des Echanges at Paris in forty days. Consignments frequently
remain in the hands of foreign agencies for several months before being forwarded,
while their consignees, having received prompt notice of their shipment from the con-
signor, very naturally regard such delays as unreasonable and unnecessary. Delays
of this sort are, of course, quite beyond the control of the Smithsonian Institution,
which can do nothing to remedy them otherwise than by correspondence and per-
suasion. Every such case is followed up as soon as brought to the notice of the of-
fice, and I fancy that I can already perceive some improvement in the promptness of
shipment and some increased interest in the subject on the part of foreign corre-
spondents.

Another occasional cause of delay arises from the fact that the Smithsonian Institu-
tion continues to be indebted to the generosity and public spirit of most of the ocean
steam-ship lines for free transportation of its exchange boxes, as it has been for many
years past. The list of transportation companies and business firms which continue
to extend this valuable privilege has undergone no change since its publication in
the report for 188687, and isreproduced as Exhibit E, hereto annexed. It naturally
and necessarily follows from this relation between the exchange service and the
transportation companies that boxes bearing the Smithsonian mark are shipped, for
the most part, by slow freight, and are subject to delays at times when paid freight
is offered in excess of the capacity of the steamers. Under special circumstances the
110 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

delay may become considerable, as, for instance, in the case of steamers from Naples,
which have been hard pressed for space on account of the use of some of them as
transports in the military operations of the Italian Government in Africa last year,
when boxes shipped by the exchange office at Rome on December 1, 1887, were re-
ceived in Washington on the 9th of April, 1888, having been detained meanwhile at
Naples in the warehouses of the steam-ship company. At this writing boxes the
shipment of which from Rome was announced more than four months ago have not
yet been received. Delays of this sort are also beyond the control of the Smithson-
ian Institution, and will be likely to recur so long as the Institution continues to be
unable to pay for its freight in the same way as other shippers.

With a view to doing away with this last-named cause of delay and to establishing
the transportation service of the international exchanges upon an assured business
basis an estimate of the probable annual cost of the service was drawn up last May,
based upon the usual ocean steam-ship charges and the average amount of freight
which may be expected to be forwarded yearly to each country. The sum estimated
was $27,050, which you presented to Congress as an amended estimate, through the
honorable Secretary of the Treasury, on the 31st of May last, but which has not yet
been acted upon.

So far as my own observations extend, and, as I have every reason to believe, for a
considerable time previous to my appointment, no avoidable delay has occurred
either in the Smithsonian exchange bureau or in the offices ofits paid agents at Lon-
don and Leipzig. The quantity and frequency of shipments to and receipts from the
different countries concerned in the international exchanges are set forth as Exhibit
F, presented herewith.

But few changes in the routine have been made during the year. Since last March
a printed card has been placed in each outgoing package, stating the date of its
shipment from the Smithsonian Institution, and requesting that any unusual delay
in its receipt be promptly reported. On the Ist of June the shipping office was sep-
arated from the receiving office with the result of a considerable economy of time and
labor. Two circulars have been issued during the year; one on March 2, requesting
the bureaus of the National Government to correct and complete their list of publi-
cations prepared in response to a circular issued in the previous year, and described
in the annual report upon international exchanges for the year ending June 30, 1887 ;
the other on May 31, requesting an expression of opinion from all the bureaus and
offices of the National Government, as to the advantage to their business of increased
speed in transmitting their publications. Both circulars were very generally answered
and have been the means of procuring valuable information for use in the future.

I take pleasure in being able to bear witness to the faithfulness and efficiency of
the employés in the exchange office. Although the greater part of them receive a
less compensation than employés in other offices of the Government, and the duties
which they perform are both laborious and responsible, the business of the office has
not at any time been in arrears, nor has any employé incurred censure for misconduct
or neglect. ‘The foreign agencies of the exchange service, conducted by Messrs. Will-
iam Wesley & Son at London and by Dr. Felix Fliigel at Leipzig, are also in every
way satisfactory as regards promptness and efficiency.

CIRCULARS RESPECTING PERIODICALS.
CIRCULAR TO THE CURATORS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Marcu 19, 1887.

DEAR SiR: It is my desire to obtain from you (1) a list of those periodicals, whether
transactions of societies or otherwise, which you deem most nearly indispensable to
your own department. This inquiry is irrespective of the fact that the Museum does
already possess them or not, and the list should be confined to the most essentially
necessary titles; if possible, not over twenty in number.

I may add, to make my meaning plainer, that standard transactions of well-known
societies concerned in all branches of science, such as the Royal Society of London,
the Comptes Rendus de l'Institut of Paris, ete., and well known periodicals admitting
the discussion of all scientific topics; such as Science, the American Journal of
Science, Nature, etc., are excluded from such a list, which is meant to cover only
those technical periodicals of most special use to your own department.

In addition to this list, and quite distinct from it, I should be pleased to nave you
give.a list (2) of recent serials, whether transactions or otherwise, of interest in con-
section with your special investigations, even if not exclusively devoted tothem. To
be more definite, let us say anything of real importance or even considerable promise
commenced within the past twelve years. There need be no limit to the number of
titles in this list, but the more important one should have a distinctive check; and I
should be very glad if it might suit your convenience to let me have it in this week
or next.

While the above two lists are especially important and are desired at your earliest
convenience, I should be pleased to have you supply me in addition with a list of
every serial publication which a worker in your field may expect to have not wholly
infrequent occasion to consult; and bere again I should be glad to have you indicate

those of most value.
S. P. LANGLEY,

Assistant Secretary.

GENERAL CIRCULAR,

JUNE 15, 1887.

Dear Sir: The Smithsonian Institution, in pursuit of the object of its foundation,
the “‘increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” has always aimed to keep a
complete list of all transactions and proceedings of learned societies and of all jour-
nals devoted to science and the nseful arts throughout the world, This, at least, is
the aim; but it must often fall short of the fulfillment of so large a purpose and from
time to time find its lists need revising, and this in two different particulars. First,
in adding to its lists new societies or new periodicals which have arisen since the
last revisal; second, in repairing lacune in 1ts sets of long established society trans-
actions or technical journals, and for this end it needs to know which still maintains
a prominent place, so that gaps in the more important ones shall receive first atten-
tion.

It has been suggested to me that you are able, and may perhaps be willing, to
assist us by supplying under these two heads the names of those special transactions

117
118 : REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

or journals which you would like to see made accessible to every student of the sub-
ject of —--- , with which your own name is here associated.

The subject of is, of course, divisible into others, such as
,and we address ourselves to you in the hope that you can oblige us with the
names of any meritorious publications, whether foreign or domestic, devoted either
to — in general, or to any such of its subdivisions.

To make our wants entirely clear, let me explain that the Institution does not or-
dinarily need to be informed of the names of societies or journals dealing with all
departments of knowledge, but only of such transactions of societies and the names
of such journals as are concerned chiefly, if not wholly, with the subject in ques-
tion, or which, at any rate, are frequently consulted by itsspecial students.

It is chiefly for such technical publications that we desire lists under the two
heads already named. To repeat: First, of those transactions of societies or periodi-
cals devoted to the principal subject in question, or to some of its branches which
have been established within the past twelve or fifteen years and which you know
to be frequently consulted; second, of those which, being long established, are of
now most generally recognized importance.

I venture to address to you this: outlined plan without having any claim upon
your kindness other than this, that the single purpose of this request is to make the
Smithsonian Library more immediately useful to every student in your own depart-
ment, and that nothing can contribute more directly to this end than your furnish-
ing the desired list, with which, if you can oblige me, I beg we may be favored
within the coming month.

In case you do not feel that your time will allow you to make it complete, I beg
you will not, on this account, refuse your help altogether, but rather that you will
put down, if only imperfectly, the transactions or journals best known to you and
which seem most desirable in connection with the general subject or with any of its
divisions as indicated.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Acting Secretary.

APPENDIX V.

ORGANIZATION OF LIBRARY.

1. By act of Congress of April 5, 1866, the Library of the Smithsonian Institution
is to be kept with the Library of Congress, but with the provision that the Institu-
tion shall continue to enjoy its customary use of it. The following regulations refer
only to those books which, under the above proviso, are retained at the Smithsonian
Institution proper, or in its Museum Library.

2. By order of the Secretary, after April 1, 1887, these are under the general direc-
tion of the Assistant Secretary, in charge of the library placed in the immediate charge
of a librarian, whose title shall be Librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, and
whose duty it shall be to decide what books shall be retained from the Library of
Congress in acentral library under his charge. The following regulations are in-
tended for the better execution of the aforesaid order.

SECTIONAL LIBRARIES.

3. Sectional libraries may be formed by the officers of the Smithscnian Institution,
namely, the assistant secretaries and the chief clerk, and also by the curators and
acting curators and the editor. Curators and acting curators are permitted, subject
to the approval of the assistant secretary in charge of the Museum, to form sectional
libraries to be kept in their respective offices, but this shall only be done by with-
drawing from the general collection such books as relate exclusively to the objects
under their care. Dictionaries, cyclopwdias, journals, or any works other than such
as relate exclusively to the special department can not form a part f such a sec-
tional library, except upon the recommendation of the librarian, approved by one of
the assistant secretaries.

4. The official in charge of each sectional library shall be responsible for its safe
keeping, and shall on no account lend the books.

5. Books in the sectional library must be returned to the central library before
they can be issued for use outside of the office or room to which they are accredited.

6. The books of each sectional library shall be kept separate from all other books
in the rooms of the official or curator, in distinet cases, the locks of which shall be
controlled by a master key in the hands of the librarian, who may, at stated times,
examine them, and call the attention of the curators to any deficiencies.

7. No person who is not a member of the scientific staff of the Museum shall with-
draw books or other matter without special written permission from one of the offi-
cers of the Smithsonian Institution. Persons taking books from the central library
shall be responsible for the safe keeping of the same, and shall make good any losses,
They shall not be allowed to withdraw other books until those which are lost have
been restored.

8. The librarian shall have authority to decide what books are suitable for any
curator’s sectional library, and to recall any book not in a sectional library within
two weeks. Permanent recalls of books from sectional libraries may be made, as
well as temporary calls. In case of certain rare or costly or encyclopedic works, or
in other special instances, the librarian shall be authorized to designate books
which shall in no case be taken from the library. This regulation shall not apply to

119
120 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

any books now actually in the office of the editor. All books and other matter not
in the sectional library shall be at all times subject to recall by the librarian.

% The librarian will be expected to exercise his discretion as to the books to be
withdrawn from the Congressional Library, but will (in the absence of special cause
to the contrary) recall any book upon receiving a written request for the same.

10. The librarian shall annually, or oftener, report to the Assistant Secretary, in
charge of the library, any defective series, any missing books, or any new serials, or
books which are specially desirable.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING ENTRY AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BOOKS.

11. All books, pamphlets, periodicals, maps, and other publications acquired by
the Smithsonian Institution through exchange or donation or purchase shall be
separately entered by the librarian, who shall prepare a reference list, with the aid
of which he shall immediately upon their receipt from the chief clerk divide them
into two classes, one of which is to be fully entered within a day of its receipt; the
other to be fully entered in any case at some time within the current week.

12. It shall be an invariable rule that such a full entry, to consist of both a day-
book and a ledger-account entry, shall be made within the above-specified time for
every separate book, or pamphlet or map, without exception; but it is understood
that this ledger account may be in the form of a card catalogue.

13. Against every title there shall be entered in the day-book the letter ‘ C”
(Smithsonian Library, deposited in Library of Congress), or ““G” (Smithsonian Li-
brary, deposited with Surgeon General), or ‘‘1” (Smithsonian Library, deposited at the
Institution) ; and it shall be the duty of the librarian to see that all books of the first
class are prepared for delivery to the Librarian of Congress within the current week.

14. The librarian shall notify the exchange department within the current week of
any new correspondent on his books, and shall also acknowledge receipt to the senders
or donors of every article at stated times, at intervals of not more than a year, and
shall make a record of such entry, with the date of acknowledgment opposite to the
entry of the work in question.

15. It shall be the duty of the librarian at all times to hold these books open to the
inspection of the Librarian of Congress, and to report to him the place and condition
of any work under his charge in answer to any specific inquiry.

16. In addition to the books which are included in ihe Smithsonian deposit in the
Library of Congress, and so stamped, there are certain books procured by the Smith-
sonian Institution for use in the National Museum. These shal? be distinctively
marked ; and it is understood that while they form no part of the above-described
books of the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress, they are in other re-
spects to be treated in accordance with the above regulations. No book or chart
belonging to the Smithsonian Institution is exempt from them unless procured for
the specific use of an officer of the Smithsonian, as above designated, and distinctively
stamped as belonging to his office.

The above rules will take effect on and after this date.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Assistant Secretary, in charge of Library.

Notr (added December 3, 1887).—Under the last clause come books purchased es-
pecially for the office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or chief clerk, forming
“‘oftice libraries,” and for these it is uuderstood that the librarian’s responsibility
ceases when he has distinctively stamped each, entered it distinctively on the card
catalogue, and also in a separate list catalogue. Indispensable books of reference in
exchange department, etc., form part of chief clerk’s office library.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19t

Nore (added February 13, 1888).—This last clause above cited is to be understood
as including the books purchased at the expense of the Museum appropriation, but
not necessarily books obtained by exchange for Museum publications, as it would
be difficult, if not impossible, always to discriminate these under our present system.
This point is reserved for future consideration, but provisionally it is understood that
the librarian is to send books to the Library of Congress if not evidently meant for
the Museum.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish summaries of scientific discovery
in particular directions; occasional reports of the investigations made
by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a general character or
on special topics, whether original and prepared expressly for the pur-
pose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and briefly to
present (as fully as space will permit) such papers not published in the
“Smithsonian Contributions” or in the “ Miscellaneous Collections ” as
may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

ASTRONOMY FOR 1887, 1888.

By WILLIAM C. WINLOCK.

The following record of the progress of Astronomy during the years
1887 and 1888 is presented in essentially the form adopted by Professor
Holden in 1879. It is thought that this form is most suitable for an
annual record, as it furnishes a series of reference notes for those espe-
cially interested in the study of astronomy, and at the same time a con-
densed review for the general reader.

The writer has made free use of reviews and abstracts which have
appeared in the Bulletin Astronomique, the Observatory, Nature, the
Atheneum, and other periodicals.

COSMOGONY.

Dr. Carl Braun, S. J., formerly director of the Kalocsa Observatory,
has collected in a book of 167 pages a series of essays, first published
in the Catholic periodical Natur und Offenbarung in 1885-’86, in which
he enters into a scientific discussion of the evolution of the universe,
more particularly the formation of the sun and planets. His theory
demands a structureless, motionless, tenuous nebula, its particles en-
dowed with gravity and atomic repulsion. Such a nebula, if perfectly
homogeneous, should give birth to one portentous solitary sun. But,
in point of fact, it would possess innumerable, almost imperceptible,
local irregularities, which, forming so many centers of attraction, would
eventually lead to the breaking up of the nebula into a vast multitude
of separate fragments. On one of these, the destined progenitor of the
solar system, we are asked to concentrate our attention. The manner
of its development is, however, a widely different one from that traced
by Laplace, who assumed the needful rotation and left the rest to work
itself out spontaneously. Dr. Braun, on the other hand, assumes less
to begin with, but invokes adventitious aid in emergencies. He ascribes
the rotation of the original solar nebula to the impact of masses drawn
in from the depths of space, comet-like projectiles, endowed with energy
external to the system. These mdsses would affect the outer shell con-

125
126 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

stituting the nebula more than they would the inner, and the result is
a central condensation surrounded by an ellipsoidal atmosphere revolv-
ing with increasing velocity as we proceed outwards from the center.
Instead of supposing that the planets are formed from rings detached
from this nebula by over spinning, Braun assumes that their formation
is determined simply by centers of condensation which existed in the
nebula itself. These formations have commenced at distances from the
central nucleus much greater than the present distances of the planets,
and the immediate result is an approach to the sun within a distance
at which its attraction is balanced by the outward gaseous pressure and
the centrifugal force. The incipient planet, animated with the greater
ancular velocity of the stratum to which it originally belonged, revolves
now at a rate slightly superior to that of the new medium in which it
finds itself. Hence the possibility of its sweeping up and annexing
fresh matter as it proceeds along the coils of its narrowing orbit, until
a point is reached when the planet, or even sun, has drawn in all the
matter which stood in its way, and gravity alone exactly balances cen-
trifugal force. The planet then revolves in an orbit sensibly the same
as at present,

As the planet in approaching the sun has encountered strata of in-
creasing density, so that the tangential resistance on the side towards
the sun has always been greater than on the opposite side, it is easy to
see that a planetary or ‘‘ direct” rotation must be set up in the direction
of revolution. In order to explain the rotation of Neptune, which is
probably, like its satellite, retrograde, it is necessary to suppose that
the birth of the planet was preceded by the formation of a ring, while
Uranus is regarded as a “limiting instance” between the annular and
the nuclear methods of generation.

Ingenious explanations are derived for the rapid motion of Phobos,
the inner satellite of Mars, for the swifter rotation of the larger planets,
and for the increase in their density and decrease in their mass as we
approach the sun. Mars is an exception; but there are reasons for
thinking it of later formation, so that when it came into existence the
space allotted for its growth was already greatly exhausted, owing
chiefly to the powerful attraction of Jupiter.

While many of Father Braun’s conclusions will not be accepted by
cosmogonists, his work forms an able contribution to the subject. Its
appearance may be said to mark the definite abandonment by sound
thinkers of the annular method of planet and satellite formation, and
gradually it is becoming clear that ‘‘ while the various members of the
sular family owned unquestionably a common origin, they can scarcely
be said to have had a common history.”

Janssen delivered an interesting discourse bearing upon the same sub-
ject at Paris, October 25, 1887—‘‘ The age of the stars,” in which he
reviewed the steps leading us to the belief that each star must have a
beginning, a period of activity, a decline, and au end; and he points
ASTRONOMY. 127

out that upon the hypothesis that stars of higher temperature will last
longer than stars of lower, we must conclude, from the testimony of the
spectroscope, that Sirius, Vega, and the greater number of the stars
visible to the naked eye are in their youth, while Aldebaran, Arcturus,
and our own sun have long since passed their period of greatest activity.

NEBULA AND STAR-CLUSTERS.

Dr. Dreyer’s new general catalogue of nebulie and clusters of stars is
essentially a new edition of Sir John Herschel’s catalogue, revised, cor-
rected, and brought down to December, 1887. It therefore forms a com-
plete list of all known nebulie, and is of the greatest value to observers.
Herschel’s General Catalogue was published in 1864 and contained 5,079
objects. D’Arrest’s work, published three years later, gave the means
of correctivg many of the errors in the earlier observations, and in 1876
Dr. Dreyer compiled a supplement from the material at that time avail-
able. Recent discoveries have given rise to a demand for a-second sup-
plement which has been wisely met by recasting the whole work. *The
present catalogue contains 7,840 objects, the positions being given in
right ascension to seconds of time and in declination to tenths of a min-
ute of are. The epoch of the first general catalogue and of D’Arrest’s
final positions—1860—has been retained ; precessions are given for 1880.
There is an index to published figures of nebule and clusters, and-an
appendix giving the places of new nebulie published too late to be in-
corporated in the catalogue itself. Further additions in numbers or in
accuracy of positions might, perhaps, now be made from the recently
published lists of Bigourdan, von Engelhardt, Ginzel, Stone, and Swift.

The largest refractor devoted almost exclusively to the observation of
nebulv is the 26-inch equatorial of the Leander McCormick Observatory.
Professor Stone’s object is to obtain as accurate positions as possible
and thus to establish the means of detecting the proper motion of these
objects if any exists. His working list embraces all nebule north of
—30° which are as bright as the fourteenth magnitude.

Dr. Dreyer has submitted to a rigid examination all reported cases
of variability or proper motion in nebule, and concludes that in not
one case can either be considered as well established. It seems that
the only well-authenticated changes are changes of brightness only,
while we so far do not possess any clear evidence of change of form or
change of place.

Detection of new nebule by photography.—Protessor Pickering in order
to test the efficacy of photography in the discovery of new nebulie has
compared the number of nebulz shown in a series of photographs of
the regions about the great nebule in Orion with the number in the
same region given by Dreyer’s catalogue. The instrument employed
was the Bache telescope, which has a photographic doublet with an
aperture of 8 inches and focal length of 44 inches. Each plate covered
a region 10 degrees square, the great nebule being about the center;
128 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

the definition was good in a central cireular area about 7 degrees in
diameter. Fourteen of the objects photographed are contained in
Dreyer’s catalogue; four in the catalogue are not photographed; twelve
that are photographed are not in the catalogue. Professor Pickering
concludes that in earrying out the same proportion we might expect
to discover four or five thousand such objects by photographing the
whole sky; but, he adds, “there is one consideration that may seriously
modify this conclusion. ‘The successive improvements in photography
have continually increased the limits of the nebula in Orion. These
plates show that it not only ineludes the sword-handle, ¢, z, and #, but
a long nebulosity extends south from €, others surround this star, while
others, both north and south, indicate that perhaps the next increase
in sensitiveness of our plates will join them all in a vast nebula many
degrees in length.”

Herr von Gothard has obtained extraordinary results with a 10-inch
reflector. His photographs, though small, show a great richness of de-
tail; several of them are reproduced in an article by Dr. Vogel, in No.
2854 of the Nachrichten. The photographs of clusters Dr. Vogel was
able to enlarge without great difficulty, but for the nebule it was ueces-
sary to resort to drawings; among the latter the reproduction of a
photograph of the spiral nebula in Canes Venatici is particularly inter-
esting.

The Ring Nebula in Lyra.—Professor Holden reports that nearly all
the nebulz examined with the 36 inch Lick telescope show a multitude
of new details of structure. In the Ring Nebula in Lyra, for example,
Lassell’s 4-foot reflector and the Washington 26-inch refractor show
thirteen stars in an oval outside the ring, and only one star within it,
while the Lick glass shows twelve stars within the ring or projected on
it, and renders it obvious that the nebula consists of a series of ovals
or ellipses—first the ring of stars, then the outer and inner edges of the
nebulosity; next a ring of faint stars round the edges of the inner ring,
and last a number of stars situated on the various parts of the nebu-
losity and outer oval.

Mr. Roberts’ photographs of the Ring Nebula in Lyra, the Great
Nebula in Andromeda, and others, also require special mention.

The Great Nebula in Orion.—In the spectrum of this nebula, Dr. Cope-
Jand has observed a new line apparently identical with D;, wave-length
587.4. The occurrence of this line in the spectrum of a nebula is of
great interest as affording another connecting link between gaseous
nebule and the sun and stars with bright-line spectra, especially with
that remarkable class of stars, of which the first examples were de-
tected by Wolf and Rayet in the constellation Cygnus.

The Pleiades.—The initial volume of publications of the Yale Observa-
tory is a valuable memoir by Dr. W. L. Elkin on the positions of the
principal stars in the Pleiades as determined with the new Yale heliom-
eter, and it is, we believe, the first heliometer work done in this coun-
ASTRONOMY, 129

try. Dr. Elkin has taken in all the stars in the Durchmusterung down
to 9.2 magnitude, which may reasonably be said to fall within the group,
and in so doing he has rejected one of the stars used by Bessel in his
celebrated work with the Koénigsberg heliometer as too faint for accu-
rate measurement, but he has added seventeen stars to Bessel’s list of
fifty-three, so that he has taken sixty-nine stars in all. Two practically
independent methods of measurement were adopted. The first plan
was to measure the distance of each star of the group from each one of
four reference stars situated so as to form a quadrilateral symmetrically
placed about the group; the position of each star thus depended on
measures of distance alone. The second plan was to measure the posi-
tion-angle and distance of each star from 7 Tauri or Alcyone, the cen-
tral star of the group. The work on the quadrilateral plan was com-
menced in March, 1884, and lasted to December—the measures from 7
Tauri occupied the first three and last four months of 1885, the mean
epoch of the second triangulation falling about a year later than that
of the first. Dr. Elkin gives a brief description of the instrument with
his method of using it, and this is followed by a determination of the
instrumental constants and by the observations in detail. The defini-
tive results are then critically compared with Bessel’s heliometer work
and with the filar micrometer measures of Wolf at Paris and Pritchard
at Oxford. The comparison with the Kénigsberg observations shows
that for the six largest stars there is a striking community of mo-
tion, both in direction and in amount, and it is remarkable that this
general direction of drift is very similar to the reversed absolute motion
of Aleyone as given by Newcomb. Dr. Elkin thinks the coincidence is
sufficiently close for two of the stars at least, and possibly for the other
four, to warrant the conclusion that they are only optically members of
the group. Of the remaining twenty-six of the thirty-two stars show-
ing some displacement since 1840, the epoch of Bessel’s catalogue, the
distribution of the direction of motion is by no means equable, six stars
only having an easterly motion, while twenty move towards the west,
and here too there seems to be a tendency to community of drift in cer-
tain groups in the same part of the cluster.

‘““The general character of the internal motions of the group appears
to be thus extremely minute. If for the six stars mentioned as with
more or less probability not belonging to the group this proves to be
the case, there are but five stars for which the displacement amounts to
over one second in forty-five years. The bright stars especially seem
to form an almost rigid system, as for only one is there really much evi-
dence of motion, and in this case (star b) the total amount is barely one
second per century. The hopes of obtaining any clew to the internal
mechanism of this cluster seem therefore not likely to be realized in an
immediate future.”

Professor Hall has measured with the 26-inch Washington refractor
the positions of sixty-three small stars in the group relatively to the

brighter stars determined by Bessel and Elkin, thus furnishing further
data for testing in the future any movement that may be going on in
the system.

Since the discovery of the nebula in the Pleiades around the star
Maia, the Henrys have been at work perfecting their apparatus, and
upon repeating their examination of the Pleiades with an exposure of
four hours, and very sensitive plates, they have defined with considera-
ble detail a great mass of cosmic matter covering a large part of the
group. The most interesting detail is a straight nebulous filament 35/
to 40’ long and only 3” to 4” wide projecting from the main mass in an
east and west direction. This filament passes over seven stars, which
it seems to connect like beads on a string; a slight change in direction
takes place where it meets the largest star. The plate contains nearly
twice as many stars as the first plate—about 2,000 down to the eight-
eenth magnitude.

Excellent photographs of the Pleiades have also been taken by Mr:
Roberts near Liverpool with an 18-inch silvered-glass reflector.

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS.

Constant of precession.—Dr. Ludwig Struve has deduced a new value
of the constant of precession and the motion of the solar system in space
from an elaborate comparison of recent Pulkowa catalogues with Brad-
ley’s observations as reduced by Auwers, thus obtaining an interval of
a century—1755.0 to 1855.0—for the determination of proper motions.
These proper motions, computed with O. Struve’s precession constant
(of 1841), were affected by the apparent displacement due to the motion
of the solar system in space and by the error of the assumed precession
constant.

They thus furnished a means of determining these two quantities.
After rejecting seven stars which seem to be exceptionally near us, the
remaining 2,509 are divided into 120 groups, forming 240 equations of
condition to be solved by least squares for the determination of the five
unknowns, the co-ordinates X, Y, Z of the sun’s “goal” (or point in
space towards which the sun is traveling, to adopt the term introduced
by Professor Newton) and the corrections Am and An to Bessel’s con-
stants. The following table shows the resulting value of the luni-solar
precession compared with that of previous caleulators:

At the end of the paper the author treats of the planetary precession
and the secular variation, and gives a list of stars whose proper mo-
tions as found by him differ from those deduced by Auwers from Green-
wich and Berlin observations. The results obtained for the motion of
the solar system are quoted elsewhere in this report.
ASTRONOMY. 151

Constant of aberration.—Herr Kiistner of the Berlin Observatory has
made a determination of the constant of aberration with a 44 inch
broken-back, universal instrument, employing what is commonly known
in this country as Talcott’s method. His resultis a correction of —0/.132
to Struve’s constant of aberration with the small probable error of
+0”.011. A further exhaustive discussion of the observations has led
the author to conclude that the latitude of his instrument in the spring
of 1884 was 0/.20440”.021 greater than in the spring of 1885—im-
portant evidence upon the mooted question of the variability of ter-
restrial latitudes.

Professor Hall has recently reduced a series of observations of @
Lyre made with the prime vertical instrument at the U. S. Naval Ob-
servatory between the years 1862 and 1867. These observations had
been designed to give corrections to the assumed values of the constants
of nutation and aberration, and an absolute determination of the paral-
lax of the star. The series was not continued for a sufficient period for
the first purpose, and a preliminary examination having shown that a
negative parallax would result, the work has been set aside till the
present time. The mean resulting parallax from the 436 observations
is z=—0".079+0".0134, and the constant of aberration = 20/7.4506+
0.0142,

On account of the uncertainty in the parallax, Professor Hall has in-
troduced a parallax of +0/.15, about the mean value indicated by nu-
merous observations of this star, and he then obtains a constant of
aberration =20/.4542+0’.0144. To this result he gives the preference
and deduces for the solar parallax 8’’.810+ 0.0062, adopting Hansen’s
value of the mean anomaly of the earth and eccentricity, Clarke’s value
for the equatorial radius of the earth, and Michelson and Newcomb’s
deterniination of the velocity of light, 186,325 miles per second.

Herr Nyrén has found in a discussion of the Pulkowa observations
of the difference of right ascension between Polaris and its companion,
evidence to confirm the hypothesis, upon which determinations of the
aberration constant rest, that the velocity of light is independent of
the state whether of motion or rest of the luminous body.

On the other hand the experiments of Michelson and Morley seem to
throw some doubt upon Fresnel’s hypotheses that the ether is at rest
exceptin transparent media, and that there it participates in the motion

of translation in the ratio a n being the index of refraction.
Loewy’s method of determining the constant of aberration from differ-
ential measurements of the changes in the distances of suitably-chosen
pairs of stars is to be tested at the Paris Observatory with an equatorial
coudé, and by Professor Comstock at the Washburn Observatory with
suitable apparatus fitted to the 6-inch equatorial. The method is essen-
tially to bring the two stars, which may be, say, 90 degrees apart in the
sky, into the field of an equatorial by reflection from the surfaces of a
12 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

double mirror at the objective: any change in the distance between the
two stars can then be measured with extreme nicety. Itshould perhaps
be mentioned that Houzeau claimed to have suggested this principle in
1871.

Diurnal nutation.—M. Niesten, in applying Folie’s formule for diurnal
nutation to the Greenwich observations of y Draconis, has found a posi-
tive parallax where Main and Downing obtained a negative value, and a
constant of aberration more closely agreeing with that generally adopted.
Introducing similar corrections in Halls discussion of the prime verti-
cal observations of a Lyre has, however, had no appreciable effect.

STAR-CATALOGUES AND CHARTS.

Paris Catalogue.—The first two volumes of the great work undertaken
by Leverrier a third of a century ago, the re-observation of the stars of
Lalande’s catalogue, have recently been published. The first volume is
the first installment of the catalogue proper, viz, stars from 0" to 6° of
right ascension, observed during the years 1837 to 1881; the second
volume gives the separate observations. Each series when complete
will extend to four volumes. The observations were made with the five
meridian instruments of the Paris Observatory, and include some 20,000
or 30,000 observations made between 1837 and 1854; they have there-
fore been divided into three periods, 183753, 185467, and 1868~81,
and severally reduced to the mean epochs 1845, 1860, or 1875. Obser-
vations subsequent to 1881, about one-fourth of the entire number, will be
published separately. The present section of the catalogue contains
7,245 stars, and represents about 80,000 observations in both elements.
It gives for each of the three periods the number of observations, the
mean date, the right ascension and north polar distance reduced to the
mean epoch, and a comparison with Lalande. The precessions for 1875
are also added. The introduction, by M. Gaillot, who has superin-
tended the reduction, contains a discussion of the probable errors of the
observations, and is followed by a comparison of the present catalogue
with Auwers’ Bradley, and an important investigation by M. Bessert
of the proper notions of a large number of stars, followed by a table of
errors in Lalande’s catalogue which the present and other catalogues
have brought to light.

Cincinnati Zone Catalogue-—Professor Porter has published the re-
sults of observations made with a 3-ineh transit instrument, at the Cin-
cinnati Observatory, upon 4,050 stars between the declinations —18° 50!
and —22° 20’, during the years 1885 to 1887. The faintest stars were of
about 8.5 magnitude, and nearly all the stars were observed three times.
The observations were made in zones, the telescope being clamped.
The transits which were recorded by the chronograph were generally
taken over five wires, and two bisections were made in declination when-
ever time allowed. The probable errors of « single observation are
+ 08,123 and + 1.84. An appendix gives the proper motion of sev-
enty-five stars dedueed from a comparison with other catalogues.
ASTRONOMY. 133

Dunsink Catalogue—The sixth part of the Dunsink observations is
devoted to a catalogue of 1,012 stars, between —2° and —23° declina-
tion, observed with the meridian circle from 1881 to 1885. The standard
stars employed are those of the Berlin Jahrbuch, and the observations
are reduced to Auwers’ system. The mean right ascensions and decli-
nations, with the annual precessions for the epoch 1885.0, the mean
epoch, and the number of observations are given.

Pulkowa.—V olume xi contains a catalogue for 1865.0 of the principal
stars, to the fourth magnitude—381 in number—as far as 15 degrees south
declination deduced from observations in the years 1861-1872. The for-
mation of a catalogue of these stars for the epoch 1845.0 was the first
piece of work completed by this observatory, and the present work is
thus enhanced in value by being an almost exact repetition of that un-
dertaken twenty years before.

Auwers’ new reduction of Bradley.—The third volume of Auwers’ new
reduction of Bradley, which has been five years in going through the
press, was finally published in 1888. ‘This volume contains, in addition
to the catalogue proper, tables giving the quantities in the reduction to
the apparent place that depend upon the star’s position, and a compar-
ison of Bradley’s positions, reduced to 1865, with Berlin and Greenwich
observations of about the same date. The catalogue contains 3,268
stars, and gives for each star the magnitude, right ascension, and dec-
lination for 1775.0, corrections to the Fundamenta of Bessels, number of
observations, epoch, precessions for 1755, 1810, and 1865, proper mo-
tions, references to Greenwich catalogues, and to double-star cata-
logues, where the star was double, and a column of notes.

An important list of 480 stars to be used as fundamental stars for
zone observations between —20° and —80° declination, is published
by Dr. Auwers in the Monthly Notices for June, 1887.

Dr. C. H. F. Peters has contributed two valuable papers to the third
volume of the Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences; the first
is a critical examination of all data bearing on Flamsteed’s twenty-two
“missing” stars, for each of which a plausible explanation is found;
and the second paper is a list of corrigenda in the catalogues, O. Arg.
S., Bonn vi, Weisse (1 and 2), Riimker, Schjellerup, Baily’s Lalande
zones, Yarnall, Glasgow, Santiago, and Geneva.

A very useful index to stars in Airy’s six Greenwich catalogues not
found in Flamsteed—the work of Miss Lamb—will be found in the
fifth volume of publications of the Washburn Observatory.

from the reports presented at the meeting of the Gesellschaft in August,
1887, show the progress of the work at that time:

Cambridge and —138° 50’ to —18° 10’ at Washington.

Star-charts.—Sectious 1 and Iv of the Southern Durchmusterung
charts (sheets 48, 53-63) have been published, bringing to a close that
most valuable work. Professor Schénfeld has issued with these last
numbers a short list of errata detected, which is reprinted in No. 2834
of the Nachrichten.

A series of charts embracing all the stars visible to the naked eye—
that is, down to about the sixth and one-half magnitude—has been pub-
lished by Mr. Cottam, and has been very highly complimented. There
are in all thirty-six sheets, the scale being one-third of an inch to one
degree of a great circle. Another useful book of the same kind is
Klein’s New Star-Atlas, which has appeared in both English and Ger-
man editions. There are eighteen maps, containing about the same
number of stars as Mr. Cottam’s, and giving also all the nebulie and
clusters visible in telescopes of moderate power—a great help to comet
hunters.

STELLAR PARALLAX.

Parallax of a Tauri.—Prof. Asaph Hall has published in No. 156 of
the Astronomical Journal, a determination of the purallax of « Tauri
from a series of observations with the 26-inch Washington equatorial,
extending from October 2, 1886, to March 15, 1887. The comparison-
star was an eleventh magnitude companion distant about 116’, in posi-
tion angle 34°.5. The resulting values of the relative parallax are:
From measures of position angle, 7=+0”.16340”.0409; and from
measures of distance, 7=+0.035+0/.0431. The mean value of the
parallax of a Tauri from these observations is, therefore, 7=0/’.102+
0.0296.

Prof. O. Struve, using the same comparison-star, recently obtained a
value nearly five times as great, namely, 7=0/.516+ 0.057,

Parallax of 2'1516.—Dr. L. de Ball, of the observatory of the Univer-
sity of Liége, has determined in a similar manner the parallax of the
ASTRONOMY. 135

brighter component (which has a sensible proper motion) of this optic-
ally double star. From measures of position angle he finds 7=+0.09L
+0.013; and from measures of distance, 7=+0.112+0/.010, The
mean result is z=+0/.104+ 0.008.

Parallax of = 2398.—A new investigation of the parallax of the double
star 2 2398 has been made by Dr. Lamp, based upon observations be-
tween May 20, 1885, and March 15, 1887. In this he not only obtains
a very satisfactory confirmation of his previous value of the parallax
(0.34) of the larger star, but he is able to show that the two stars are
at practically the same distance. For the principal star he finds the
annual parallax equal to 0/.3520+0’.0140; for the smaller, 0/.3548
+0”.0131; or for the mean, 0/.353+0.014. The magnitudes are 8.7
and 8.2, respectively, and the common proper motion about —0°.17 in
right ascension, and +1/.90 in declination annually.

Parallax of first-magnitude stars in the northern hemisphere.—Dr. Elkin
has completed his heliometer measures for the determination of the
parallax of the ten stars of the first magnitude in the northern hemi-
sphere, and summarizes his results in the following table:

The mean of the ten parallaxes gives for the mean parallax of a first-
magnitude star, +0/.089 +0”.015, a result according well with the
values deduced by Gyldén (0.084) and Peters (0.102).

The probable errors include an estimation of the probable systematic
error of the measures. They are therefore considerably larger than
those generally assigned to such results, which, as a rule, only take into
account the mere casual error of observation.

It will be seen on inspection of the table that of the ten stars six
may be said to give indications of a measurable parallax, but in only
two cases, a Canis Minoris and a Aquilx, are the values in any degree
remarkable, and these confirm closely results of former investigators ;
Auwers and Wagner having obtained +0/.240 +0/.029 and +0/.299
+0.038 respectively for Procyon, and W. Struve +0/.181 + 0.094 for
Altair. On the other hand, the next two largest results, those for
136 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

a Bootis and a Aurigee, do not confirm the large values found by
O. Struve, +0/.516 and +0/.505; but in the case of the former star
there is a close agreement with Hall, who got +0.102 +0/.030, and
there seems to be but little doubt that the Pulkowa value is largely
in error.

Of the four stars where the parallactic displacement has been inap-
preciable, Arcturus, with its large proper motion of over 2/’, second
only to that of a Centauri in all of the 200 brightest stars down to the
fourth magnitude, is especially note-worthy. The minuteness of the
parallax is beyond doubt, depending, as it does, on five pairs of com-
parison stars, all in reasonable agreement, and it can not be considered
as seriously at variance with the results previously obtained by Peters
and Johnson, +0127 +0.073 and -+0/.138 +0.052 respectively,
when their liability to systematic error is taken into account. The Yale
result for a Lyre does not fall in well with those hitherto deduced for
this star. If we commence at the epoch of W. Struve and neglect the
earlier attempts to find the absolute parallax, we have the following list
of values:

from which a parallax of about +0/.17 would seem well assured. The
pair of comparison stars used by Elkin are very symmetrical, and so
large a value would seem incompatible with the heliometer measures.
Photographic determination of stellar parallax.—Professor Pritchard,
of the Oxford University Observatory, pursuing his experimental work
upon the determination of stellar parallax by the help of photography,
has published the following interesting results. The last three are pro-
visional, having been determined from only six months’ observations :

Professor Pritchard lays stress upon the fact that each photographie
plate must be considered as carrying its own scale; and, due regard
being paid to the unavoidable, though slight, variations of scale in the
different plates, he is of opinion that in this delicate classof work pho-
tography wili give as accurate results as any other known method.

For 61 Cygni the value given rests upon the measurement of three
hundred and thirty plates, taken upon eighty-nine nights; each com-
ponent was referred to four comparison stars. On each of fifty-three
nights four photographic plates were taken of » Cassiopex, the ex-
posures varying from five to ten minutes. Experiments seemed to indi-
cate, however, that sufficiently approximate results, with a great saving
of labor, would be obtained by confining the observations to about five
nights in each of four periods of the year indicated by the position of
the parallactic ellipse. Professor Pritchard proposes to apply this
method systematically to all those stars between magnitudes one and
one-half and two and one-half which attain at Oxford a suitable alti-
tude; and he hopes to obtain good results for all of these stars that have
a parallax not less than the thirtieth of a second of are.

DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS.

Extension of the law of gravitation to stellar systems.—Professor Hall,
in a discussion of this question in the Astronomical Journal, after a re-
view of the various speculations upon the subject, says: ‘*The weakness
of the proof that the Newtonian law governs the motions of double
stars arises from two sources. In the first place, the errors of obser-
vation have a large ratio to the quantities measured. This condition
makes it difficult to compute the orbits with much accuracy, or we may
satisfy the observations with very different elements. - - - The
insufficiency in the data can only be removed by further observation.
Since there is no theoretical difficulty in the way, the continuation of
the observations of double stars and the improvement of methods of ob-
servation will, in time, give the means for the accurate determination
of their apparent orbits. The theoretical difficulty in proving the law
of Newton for double stars can not be overcome. But we can increase
the probability of the existence of this law by determining more orbits
138 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

and those that are very differently situated. If the law prove satis-
factory in all cases, we shall have a probability of its universality in-
creasing with the progress of astronomy.” But, although this proba-
bility may be very great, it can not constitute a proof offering the char-
acter of experimental certainty which clothes the law of Newton itself
in our planetary system. 5

A serious difficulty is encountered in the enormous velocities with
which quite a number of stars appear to be moving through space, “run-
away” Groombridge—1830, 4 Cassiopee, 6 Hydri, a Bootis, and others.
Some of these velocities are comparable to that of a comet in close prox-
imity to the sun, but in most cases there is no visible object near the
one in motion to which we can ascribe an attractive force, acting accord-
ing to the Newtonian law, which would produce the velocity observed,
unless we assume enormous masses.

An interesting article upon this subject is contributed by M. Tisse-
rand to the Bulletin Astronomique for January, 1887.

Milan Double star observations. —Professor Schiaparelli has published,
in the Milan volume 33, his first series of double star observations made
at that observatory with the 8-inch refractor from 1874 to 1885. There
are four hundred and sixty-five stars in his list, and in most of them
the components are less than 5” apart. In an appendix are given the
mean results for a number of the closest pairs as measured with the
18-inch refractor. With this instrument he discovered that the prinei-
pal star of ¢ Hydre is itself a very close double, the magnitudes of the
two components being 4 and 5.5, and distance 0.2 or 0.25. The first
part of the volume contains a detailed description of the optical per-
formance of the 8-inch refractor, a discussion of the errors of the mi-
crometer and of the accidental errors of observation, and a very full
comparison with Dembowski’s measures. The differences in the deter-
mination of position angle due to the varying inclination of the line
joining the two stars to the line of the observer’s eyes are also investi-
gated, but the reversion prism was not used. Professor Schiaparelli
finds that his measures of distance are free from systematic errors, due
to personality, but his position angles have a tendency to be small as
compared with those of other observers.

Professor Hough has published a catalogue of two hundred and nine
new double stars discovered and measured by himself with the 183-inch
refractor of the Dearborn Observatory. Short lists of uew doubles
discovered with the McCormick 26-inch, and the Lick 36-inch, have also
been published. Burnham’s list of his discoveries with the 36-inch re-
fractor in three months is very interesting, containing as it does new
companions to vy Cassiope, 11 mag., 2.2 distant; and a Tauri, 12 mag.,
2.3 distant.

The following table contains the results of recent computations of
the orbits of binary stars. The star 6 Hquulei is of especial interest,
as the period of eleven and a half years assigned to it is the shortest of
any known pair.

The multiple star € Cancri.—Professor Seeliger’s recent investigations
have confirmed the results of his earlier work, and those obtained by
Struve in 1874. ‘The threestars A, B, and C have the magnitudes re-
spectively, 5.0, 5.7, and 5.3. The proper motion of the system amounts
in a century to +10°%.6 in right ascension, and to —11” in declination.
The close pair, A and B, have a motion round each other in about sixty
years, their apparent distance varying from about 0.6 to 1.1; whilst
C, the more distant companion, has moved through about 55° of posi-
tion angle round the other two since Herschel’s observations in 1781,
its distance never very greatly varying from 54’. The motion of A
and b round their common center of gravity does not appear to be dis-
turbed to any appreciable extent by the influence of C, which is so placed
as not to affect their apparent relative motions, even though a very con-
siderable mass beassigned to it, and as a fact Professor Seeliger finds, for

cal retrogression of © itself which is most easily accounted for by sup-
posing the presence of a close companion, one hitherto undetected, and
therefore either entirely dark or but faintly luminous. The distance of
this companion is probably only a few tenths of a second, the distance of
C from the point, s., round which it appears to revolve, and which may
reasonably be assumed to be the center of gravity of itself and of D, the
as yet undiscovered fourth member of the family, being only about one-
fifth of a second. The entire group may then be considered as a double
double.

VARIABLE AND COLORED STARS.

Chandler’s catalogue of variable stars.—The most important work upon
variable stars since Schoenfeld’s “ Zweiter Catalog,” now thirteen years
old, is a new catalogue published by Mr. 8S. C. Chandler as Nos. 179 and
180 of the Astronomical Journal. In the absence of any later catalogue
from Schoenfeld this immediately takes its place as the standard, though
the author states that it is preliminary to a more complete catalogue
which will embody a series of observations and definitive investigations
now in hand.

An analysis of the catalogue shows that of the 225 stars comprised
in it 160 are distinetly variable; in 12 the periodic character is rather
uncertainly defined; 14 are distinctly irregular; 12 belong to the so-
called nove, or have been seen at only one appearance; and the 27 re-
maining have been toa little observed for the character of the variation
to be properly known. Of the 160 periodical variables, epochs of both
maximum and minimum are assigned for 63; maximum epochs alone
for 82; minimum epochs alone for 14,9 of these being of the Algol
type, while in one the period alone is given. The elements of 124 stars
are the results of Mr. Chandler’s own investigations; 22 are taken from
Schoenfeld; and 14 from other computers after Mr. Chandler had care-
fully confirmed them. The systematic perturbations shown by many
of the periods have received attention, and the further study of this
subject promises important additions to our knowledge of the causes
of stellar variation.

A useful novelty introduced in numbering the stars calls for unquali-
fied approval. Instead of giving them consecutive numbers each is dis-
tinguished by a number equal to one-tenth of the right ascension ex-
pressed in time-seconds for the equinox 1900.0. In this way the numer-
ation need not be disturbed by fresh discoveries.

The catalogue gives in successive columns a serial number assigned
in the way just described; Schoenfeld’s number; the right ascension
and declination for 1855, and the annual variations; the discoverer ;
date of discovery; redness on an arbitrary scale; magnitude at maxi-
mum and at minimum; Greenwich mean time of maximum and mini-
mum; period; remarks; and approximate place for 1900.

A very ingenious method of estimating the colors was employed by
Mr. Chandler; it consists in estimating the relative change in bright-
ness effected in two stars by the interposition, first, of a blue and then
of ared shade glass. If a red and a white star appear of the same
brightness, when viewed directly, the red star will seem the fainter
when the blue glass is interposed, but the brighter with the red glass;
and these differences of brightness can be very precisely estimated by
Argelander’s method, and they thus afford definite measures of the
differences in color of the two stars on an arbitrary scale depending
upon the glasses employed. Mr. Chandler finds that the effect of
brightness upon the scale-estimates is imperceptible, at least between
ASTRONOMY. 141

the second and ninth magnitudes. An important result of his obser-
vations is the intimate connection shown between the length of period
and the depth of color of the star; the very short-period variables are
nearly white; those of longer period somewhat redder, the tint grow-
ing deeper, the longer the period.

Several new variable stars have been detected by Chandler, Sawyer,
Espin, and others, and among them are two of more than ordinary in-
terest, as they apparently belong to the well-known “ Algol-type.” The
first was discovered by Mr. Chandler in the constellation Cygnus (Y
Cygni), right ascension =20" 47".5; declination =+34° 14/ (DM, +
34°, 4181). Its light varies from 7.1 magnitude to about 7.9 magni-
tude, and the period is probably 14 11" 56™ 48s, The second star re-
ferred to, was discovered by Mr. Sawyer in March, 1887, in the constel-
lation Canis Major, and as it is the first undoubted variable found in
that constellation, it will probably be known as RK Canis Majoris. Its
position for 1887 is right ascension =7" 14™.4; declination =—16° 11’,
The minimum observed by Mr. Sawyer was 6.7 magnitude, and the
period is 143" 15™ 55%. Mr. Chandler has collected the observations of
U Uphiuchi, of all variables the one with shortest period and the most
rapid fluctuations of light, and he finds a curious but well-marked re-
tardation in the inerease of brillianey some half-hour or so after mini-
mum is passed. A similar irregularity has been noticed in the light-
curve of S Caneri and occasionally in that of Algol.

Mr. Chandler strongly urges the possessors of large refractors to
devote a portion of their time to the observation of the minima of vari-
ables that become too faint for ordinary telescopes, our knowledge of
such variables being extremely deficient. Argelander’s method of ob-
servation is recommended.

Professor Pickering has in preparation an index to observations of
variable stars which will give for each star the number of observations -
each year since the discovery of variability. This index will be pub-
lished in volume 18 of the Annals of the Harvard Observatory.

In an interesting article published in the Observatory (April, 1888),
Miss Clerke has collected a series of notes upon variable double stars.
These stars show for the most part a spectrum analogous to that of
Sirius, that is of Class I, although single stars of that class hardly ever
show any fluctuations in brightness. Algol-variables, if the eclipse
theory of their changes be admitted, make no exceptions to this rule ;
Gore’s catalogue contains three examples: 6 Orionis, S Monocerotis,
and Y Virginis, and among the well-known doubles are y Virginis,
€ Bootis, z Bootis, 38 Geminorum, a Piscium, 6 Serpentis, and / Scor-
pii, and perhaps 6 Cygni. With few and doubtful exceptions, revolv-
ing double stars vary in concert, if they vary at all. The changes of
y Virginis illustrate the mode of procedure in this respect of couples
intrinsically equal. They alternate in each component, and can thus
be detected only by close attention. Each may be described as nor-
142 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

mally of the third magnitude; and each in turn declines by about half
a magnitude and recovers within a few days, yet so that the general
preponderance, during a cycle of several years, remains to the same
star. Miss Clerke suggests that simultaneous variation in the color of
neighboring stars may lead to the discovery of their physical depend-
ence.

Mr. G. F. Chambers has prepared a catalogue (still in manuscript) of
seven hundred and eleven red stars, brighter than the eight and one-
half magnitude, the result of observations made from 1870 to 1886;
less than twelve stars, according to Mr. Chambers, can properly be
termed carmine or ruby.

STELLAR PHOTOMETRY.

The magnitudes of the standard stars of the British, French, German,
Spanish, and American nautical almanacs have been rediscussed by
Professor Pickering, and his results will probably be adopted in future
issues of the French, Spanish, and American works. The plan pro-
posed was, that the magnitude adopted for each star should be the
mean of those derived from the Harvard Photometry, the photometric
observations of Wolff, the Uranometria Oxoniensis, and the Urano-
metria Argentina. The list published embraces 800 stars, and of these
the magnitudes of all but 64 depend upon at least two and generally
upon three authorities; 132 stars being common to all four of the
adopted standard catalogues of brightness.

A “wedge-photometer,” constructed under the direction of Professor
Pritchard for the Harvard Observatory, has been submitted to a careful
examination by Professors Langley, Young, and Pickering, and it ap-
pears from Professor Langley’s investigation of the wedge, by means
of his bolometer, that there is a selective absorption of light throughout
the wedge; feeble in the more luminous portion of the spectrum, but
of such a character that, broadly speaking, the transmissibility always
increases from the violet toward the red, increasing very greatly in the
infra-red, These results have been confirmed by Professor Pickering’s
experiments, and they emphasize the danger, already recognized by
Professor Pritchard, of employing an instrument of this kind in the
observation of deeply-colored stars.

From a comparison of the star-magnitudes of the Oxford Uranometry
with those of Wolff’s second catalogue, and with those of the Harvard
Photometry, Professor Pickering has found that the Oxford magnitudes
are, on the average, less than the Harvard magnitudes for stars down
to the third magnitude, but greater for the fourth and fifth, and less
again for stars below the sixth. The Harvard catalogue differs less
from those of Wolff and Pritchard than the two latter do from each
other,

STELLAR SPECTRA.

Photographie study of stellar spectra. Henry Draper memorial.—Pro-
fessor Pickering, in his annual report for 1888, presents the progress
made in the various investigations of stellar spectra as follows: A cata-
logue has been prepared of the spectra of 10,875 stars, covering the
entire sky north of --25°. The 8-inch Bache telescope has been used
for this work. Six hundred and thirty-three plates have been taken,
and 27,953 spectra have been examined. The type of spectrum is
given in each case, and in about six thousand cases additional lines are
visible and have accordingly been described. The photographie in-
tensities of the spectra have also been measured, giving a photometric
measure of the stars by which those of different colors may be com-
pared. The first draft of a spectroscopic catalogue has been prepared,
including the place of each star for 1900, its designation and magni-
tude in various catalogues, its photographic brightness, and the descrip-
tion of each spectrum. The photographs required for the second inves-
tigation on the spectra of the fainter stars are nearly completed. The
instruments employed in both of these investigations were prepared
for shipment to Peru, where the work will be continued among the
southern constellations. The detailed study of the brighter stars with
the 11-inch Draper telescope has been extended by the use of plates
stained with erythrosin. The sodium line D in these spectra has thus
been photographed as a double line. A catalogue has been formed of
the lines in some of the brighter stars. In Sirius the lines, except
those due to hydrogen, are very faint. But nearly four hundred of
them have been measured in different photographs of this star; fifteen
are recorded between the lines H and K. A beginning has also been
made of the study of the spectra of the variable stars.

Dr. von Konkoly and his assistant, Dr. Kévesligethy, have carried
the spectroscopic survey of the heavens begun by Vogel and Dunér to
15 degrees south declination, and have published their work in volume
8, part 2, of the O’Gyalla observations. The instrument used was a
Zoellner spectroscope. Vogel’s arrangement of types was followed.
The catalogue contains in all 2,022 stars, down to 7.5 magnitude. But
one bright line spectrum was suspected, a star of 6.5 magnitude 50/
north of € Orionis, and this star, as well as 4, 6, and ¢ Orionis, is found
to have a variable spectrum.

Among the peculiarities detected in stellar spectra may be noted the
discovery by Espin on August 13, 1888, of a bright line in the spectrum
of the variable star R Cygni; and as Dunér found it in 187982 of a weak
IL type, an extraordinary change seems to have taken plaee. Espin’s
bright line was apparently of a temporary character, and faded rapidly.

Motion of stars in the line of sight.—The spectroscopic observations for
the determination of the motions of stars in the line of sight have been
continued at Greenwich and at the Temple Observatory, Rugby, the
144 RECORD OF SCIENGE FOR 1887 AND. 1888.

only two observatories that have thus far given systematic attention
to this important line of work. The most interesting results are in the
case of Sirius, which, when first observed at Greenwich in the winter of
1875-76, seemed to be receding from us at the rate of 24 miles per
second. This recession gradually changed to an approach of 5 miles
per second in 1882-83, increasing to 24 miles in 188586, and then
dropping to 1 mile in 1886~87, and now becoming a recession again, in
1887, of 6 miles per second. As the Astronomer Royal remarks, these
results are to be accepted with caution; the F line for which the meas-
ures were made would seem to have changed somewhat its character-
istics, and the observation is moreover one of extreme difficulty, the
discordances obtained on different nights being almost as great as the
whole range of displacement noted.

Dr. Vogel, of Potsdam, has successfully applied photography to the
determination of the displacement of lines in stellar spectra due to a
motion of the star in the line of sight. Two Rutherford prisms were
used, the observations being made on the third line of hydrogen, H;.
Dr. Scheiner, who has been carrying out these experiments, has exam-
ined the spectra of Sirius, Procyon, Castor, Arcturus, Aldebaran, Pol-
lux, and Rigel. Of these, Sirius showed a slight displacement toward
the red, thus indicating a motion away from us; Procyon a decided dis-
placement, and Rigel a very large one in the same direction, while Arc-
turus showed a considerable displacement towards the violet. A sys-
tematic examination of all stars of the first and second magnitudes is
to be undertaken with improved apparatus.

ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

The Paris International Astrophotographic Congress.—The general in-
terest in the application of photography to astronomical observations
has resulted in a meeting called by the French Academy of Sciences,
at the instance of Admiral Mouchez, for the purpose of uniting upon
a plan for preparing by international co-operation a photographie
chart of the heavens more extensive than any hitherto attempted
by the usual methods. The Congress was opened at the Paris Ob-
servatory on April 16, 1887, by M. Flourens, minister of foreign af-
fairs of the French Government, and addresses were made by M. Ber-
trand, the eminent mathematician, by Admiral Mouchez, director of the
Paris Observatory, and by Professor Struve, director of the Pulkowa
Observatory. Fifty-six members were present, including thirty-seven
foreign astronomers, representing sixteen nations. Admiral Mouchez
was chosen honorary president; Strnve, president; Auwers, Christie,
and Taye, vice-presidents; Bakhuyzen and Tisserand, secretaries, and
Dunér and Trépied, assistant secretaries. At the first meeting a com-
mittee of nineteen was appointed to consider and report upon the size
and construction of the instruments to be employed, and upon the limit
of star-magnitudes to be included in the photographs. This committee
ASTRONOMY. 145

reported on April 19, and after some discussion it was decided to divide
the Congress into two sections—one to deal with purely astronomical
questions, and the other with questions pertaining to the photographic
side of the problem. Hach section drew up a series of resolutions which
were further discussed and amended by the Congress in full session, the
result being an agreement to adopt refracting telescopes of 13 inches
aperture and 114 feet focal length, and to undertake two series of pho-
tographs of the entire sky, one taking in stars as faint as the fourteenth
magnitude, the other stopping at the eleventh. The ultimate aim is to
convert the positions of the stars upon these last plates into the usual
co-ordinates of right ascension and declination, and to publish them in
the form of a star catalogue, and to prepare from the series embracing
the fainter stars a set of glass positives for each of the co-operating ob-
servatories or nations.
Following are the resolutions in detail as finally adopted:

(1) The progress made in astronomical photography demands tnat
astronomers of the present day should unite in undertaking a descrip-
tion of the heavens by photograhpic means.

(2) This work shall be carried out at selected stations, and the instru-
ments shall be identical in their essential parts.

(3) The principal objects shall be: a. To prepare a general photo-
graphic chart of the heavens for the present epoch, and to obtain data
which shall enable us to determine the positions and magnitudes of all
stars down toa certain magnitude, with the greatest possible accuracy
_ (magnitudes being understood in a photographic sense to be defined

later). b. To be able to utilize in the best way, both in the present and
in the future, the data obtained by photographic means.

(4) The instruments employed shail be exclusively refractors.

(5) The stars shall be photographed as far as the fourteenth magni-
tude, inclusive; this magnitude being indicated provisionally by the
seale actually in use in France, and with the reservation that its pho-
tographic value shall be definitely fixed afterward.

(6) The aperture of the object-glasses shall be 0.383 meter (13.
inches), and the focal length about 3.43 meters (114 feet), so that a
minute of are shall be represented approximately by 0.001 meter.

(7) The directors of observatories shall be at liberty to have the object-
glasses made where they desire, provided they fulfill the general con-
ditions laid down by the Congress.

(8) The aplanatism and achromatism of the objectives shall be caleu-
lated for radiations near the Iraunhofer ray G.

(9) All the plates shall be prepared according to the same formula ;
this formula to be subsequently agreed upon.

(10) A permanent control of these plates from the point of view of
their relative sensibility to the different radiations shall be instituted.

(11) Questions in regard to the preservation aud reproduction of the
negatives can not at present be settled, and shall be referred to a

special committee.
(12) The same conclusions are adopted in regard to the photographie
magnitudes of the stars.

(13) Resolution 8 above, in regard to the aplanatism and achromatism
of the object-glasses, shall be understood in the sense that the mini-
mum focal distance shall be that of a ray near G, so as to attain the
Inaximum sensibility of the photographic plates.

H, Mis. 142

146 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

(14) The object-glasses shall be constructed in such a manner that
the field to be measured shall extend at least 1 degree from the center.

(15) In order to eliminate fictitious stars and to avoid inconvenience
from minute specks which may exist upon the plates, two series of
negatives shall be made for the whole sky.

(16) The two series of negatives shall be so made that the image of
a star situated in the corner of a plate of the first series shall be found
as nearly as possible in the center of a plate of the second series.

(17) Besides the two negatives giving the stars down to the four-
teenth magnitude another series shall be made with shorter exposures,
to assure a greater precision in the micrometrical measurement of the
fundamental stars, and render possible the construction of a catalogue.

(18) The supplementary negatives, destined for the construction of the
catalogue, shall contain all the stars down to the eleventh magnitude
approximately. The executive committee shall determine the steps to
be taken to insure the fulfillment of this condition.

(19) Each photographic plate to be used in the formation of the cata-
logue shall be accompanied by all the data necessary to obtain the
orientation and the value of its scale; and, as far as possible, these data
shall be written on the plate itself. Hach plate of this kind shall show
a well-centered copy of a system of cross-wires for the purpose of elimi-
nating errors which may be produced by a subsequent deformation of
the photographie film. Further details of this nature shall be deter-
mined by the executive committee.

(20) In the negatives intended for the map the number of cross-wires
to be used in their control and reduction shall be reduced to a mint-
mum.

(21) The tubes of the photographic instruments shall be constructed
of the metal most likely to give an invariable focal plane and shall carry
a graduation for the determination and regulation of the position of the
plate.

(22) The executive committee shall choose the reference stars to be
used.

(23) The question of the methods of measurement and the conversion
of the numbers obtained into right ascensions and declinations for the
equinox of 1900 is left to the executive committee. That committee
shall first occupy itself with the study and methods of use of measuring-
instruments, giving either rectangular or polar co-ordinates, and based
upon the simultaneous use of scales for the larger distances, and mi-
crometer screws for scale subdivisions.

(24) The connection of the plates will be effected in conformity with
resolution No. 16.

At the last general session, April 25, the Congress delegated its pow-
ers to a permanent committee, consisting of the directors of the observa-
tories actually taking part in the work, and the following eleven mem-
bers chosen by ballot, viz.: Christie, Dunér, Gill, Prosper Henry, Janssen,
Loewy, Pickering, Struve, Tacchini, Vogel, and Weiss. The observa-
tories of Algiers, Bordeaux, Cape of Good Hope, Greenwich, La Plata,
Melbourne, Oxford, Paris, Potsdam, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, San Fer-
nando, Sydney, Tacubaya, Toulouse, have been pledged to co-operate,
and the instruments for several of them are well advanced. No observa-
tory in the United States has thus far signified definitely its intention of
co-operating, though the Government has been appealed to to appropri-

ate the necessary funds for the Washington Observatory. The business
of the permanent committee is transacted through an executive bureau,
consisting of Admiral Mouchez, president; Christie, Dunér, Janssen,
Struve, and Tacchini, members, and Gill, Loewy, and Vogel, secretaries,
It is expected that meetings of the permanent committee will be held
every three years, though they may be called more frequently if found
desirable. Before adjourning, the Congress elected also a special com-
mittee, to occupy itself with the application of photography to astron-
omy other than the construction of a map, acting in eoncert with the
permanent committee. Messrs. Common and Janssen were requested
to take charge of this matter. They have communicated by circular
with all who are likely to be interested in this work, and propose to call
a meeting at Paris, and form a committee for the consideration of the
best means of carrying out the plan suggested by the Congress.

As many preliminary experiments are necessary in arranging details,
special subjects of investigation have been referred to different astron-
omers. For instance, the study of the proper form of reticule, to Vogel;
photographic magnitudes, to Struve and Pickering; optical deformation
of images, to Struve; study of three or four stars nearly in a straight
line, embracing an angular distance of about 1 degree, and photographed
necessarily at the center and corner of a plate, to the observatories of
Algiers, Leyden, Paris, Pulkowa; distortion of the sensitive film, to Al-
giers, Meudon, Potsdam; curved plates, Christie; orientation of the
plates, the Cape, Paris; measuring apparatus, to a special committee;
formula for the preparation of the plates, Abney, Eder; the effect of
colors of the stars upon the photographic magnitude, Dunér.

The permanent committee has published, through the Paris Academy,
three reports: the first, a full account of the Congress held in April,
1887; the other two, “bulletins,” containing correspondence and results
of the preliminary investigations. These papers are of great importance
in the proposed photographic work, but they can hardly be reviewed
satisfactorily here. The most extensive are: ‘‘ Note sur application de
la photographie aux mesures micrométriques des étoiles, T.-N. Thiele ;
De Vinfluence des durées de la pose sur Vexactitude des photographies
stellaires, J. Scheiner; Travaux préparatoires effectués 4 Vobservatoire

de Harvard College sur les résultats photométriques, E. C. Pickering;
Etendue du champ des clichés photographiques de Vobservatoire de
Paris, MM. Henry.”

It is strongly recommended that the plates be measured at a central
bureau established in the neighborhood of Paris.

Professor Pritchard having undertaken, for the photographie com-
mittee of the Royal Society, an examination of two silver-on-glass mit-
rors of the same aperture but of very different focal lengths, with a view
of ascertaining the practical effects of focal length on the photographie
148 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

field, has concluded that mirrors are unsuitable for any extensive chart-
ing, particularly mirrors of short focal length; at the same time there
is no doubt as to their capacity for the singularly accurate delineation
of small portions of the heavens, and for such operations as those con-
nected with stellar parallax or the charting of the moon.

Mr. Roberts has described in the Monthly Notices (49: 5-13) an in-
strument which he calls the *‘stellar pantograver,” intended to surmount
the difficulties of reproducing the negatives after they have been ob-
tained. Itis essentially an instrument for engraving upon copper plates
points of the same size and in the same relative positions as those de-
picted by the photographs.

In the long exposures of two hours and upwards that some of the
photographs have required there is considerable danger of displace-
ments of the images upon the plates due to variations in the refraction.
Dr. Dreyer has found that in latitude +50° such displacements are not
likely to exceed 0.5 (and will therefore not affect sensibly the symmetry
of the images) in the case of an equatorial star moving from 27™ east
to 27™ west of the meridian or in the ease of a star of +25° declination
moving from 39™ east to 39™ west.

The photographic work of Professor Pickering upon stellar spectra,
and of Gothard, Vogel and Roberts upon nebule, has been mentioned
under these headings. Rapid progress has been made by Dr. Gill with
his southern photographic Durchmusterung.

COMETS.

Comet Encke (1888 I1).—Encke’s well-known periodic comet was
picked up by Mr. Tebbutt, of Windsor, New South Wales, with the
help of the ephemeris of Backlund and Seraphinoff, on July 8, 1888,
ten days after it had passed perihelion. In a 44-inch telescope it ap-
peared as a small, bright, well-condensed nebula, about 1’ in diam-
eter, without a nucleus. It was observed at Windsor till August 1,
when it was ‘of the last degree of faintness,” and at the Cape to
August 9, but it was unfavorably situated for observation in the
northern hemisphere.

Berberich has discussed the brightness of Eneke’s comet as seen at
different returns from 1786 to 1885, and calls attention to the rather
remitrkable circumstance that the comet has been most conspicuous
when seen near a time of maximum of solar spots, and least when re-
turning near a minimum.

Comet Faye (1858 [V).—Found by Perrotin, at Nice, August 9, 1883,
by the help of a sweeping ephemeris prepared by Kreutz. It was de-
scribed as a very faint, circular nebulosity about one minute in extent,
with a slight central condensation. Although it remained visible as
late as February, 1889, on account of its extreme faintness but few
observations seemed to have been secured. Maximum brightness was
reached about the beginuing of December. The correction to the
ASTRONOMY. 149

ephemeris computed directly from the elements was —4™.4; + 4’, corre-
sponding to a retardation of the perihelion time of about two days.

Comet Olbers, originally discovered by the celebrated Dr. Olbers on
March 6, 1815, was picked up by Brooks on August 24, 1887, inde-
dendently of Ginzel’s ephemeris. Bessel, who made a discussion of
the earlier observations, predicted a return to perihelion on February
9, 1887, and Dr. Ginzel, rediscussing the orbit in a very elaborate
manner, found the most probable date of perihelion to be Decem-
ber 17, 1886, with an uncertainty of 1.6 years. Perihelion actually
occurred on October 8, 1887. Especial interest attaches to this comet
as the third member of the group of comets having a period of about
seventy-five years (Halley’s, Pons’, and Olbers’), which has returned
to perihelion in conformity with prediction. Kammermann, at Geneva,
described it on August 29, 1887, as a bright 7.8 magnitude, with a faint
tail. There seems to be no reason for supposing that it has lost any-
thing of its ight-giving power since its previous appearance in 1815.
The last observation at this return was made at the Lick Observatory
on July 5, 1888, when the theoretical brightness was less than one-
tenth that at the time of discovery.

Comet Tempel.—YThe comet discovered by Tempel on July 3, 1873, and
found to have a period of five and one quarter years, was observed at its
return in 1878, but escaped observation in 1883 when it was due at peri-
helion on November 20, The conditions of visibility seem to be even
' worse for the return of 1889, the comet remaining too near the sun,
while the circumstances of the return in 1894 are but little different
from those of 1883.

Comet Winnecke.—Von Haerdtl has rediscussed the motion of Win-
necke’s comet, making use of observations at a later return than Op-
polzer could employ in 1880. The object was to detect, if possible, any
increase in the mean motion similar to that exhibited by Encke’s comet,
though not sensible in Faye’s comet, possibly owing to its great perihe-
lion distance. He finds no acceleration whatever of the mean motion,
the actual figures indicating rather a slight retardation, but far too
small to justify any conclusion other than absence of change in the
mean motion and length of period.

mation it appeared that the comet was seen at Blauwberg, near Cape
Town, on the same evening, by a farmer and a fisherman, and a day or
two later it was seen at several places in Australia. Dr. Thome was
150 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

not able to confirm his discovery till January 20. From the 22d to the
25th the comet was a beautiful object to the naked eye—a narrow,
straight, sharply defined, graceful tail, over 40 degrees long, shining
with a soft starry light against the dark sky, beginning, apparently,
without a head, and gradually widening and fading as it extended up-
wards. At the Cape of Good Hope it was observed from January 22
to 28, the long, straight tail recalling the comet of February, 1880. The
Revista do observatorio for February, published by Dr. Cruls at Rio
Janeiro, gives a sketch of the comet made on January 24. The nucleus
was then somewhere beyond the bright star a Gruis, invisible in the
haze of the horizon, and the tail stretched up beyond / Hydrae, a nar-
row ribbon 52 degrees in length and about half a degree in width. As
far as we have been able to learn the comet was not seen at all in the
northern hemisphere, and was not followed in the southern hemisphere
beyond the end of January.

Unfortunately, also, no well-defined nucleus, or even the slightest

condensation as a point of observation could be made out at any of the
observatories at which the comet was visible, and from the rough ob-
servations which were obtained it is impossible to determine the orbit
with any degree of precision. The earlier dispatches suggested the
identity of the new comet with the great comet of 1880, apparently on
the ground of a general similarity of the circumstances of the apparition,
and on the fact that the line of sight nearly intersected the orbit of the
comet of 1880; but Mr. Chandler, who has made a critical discussion of
all the observations obtained, has been unable to reconcile them with an
orbit similar to that of the group of great comets of 1543, 1880, and 1882;
the orbit that he obtains bears a closer resemblance, in fact, to those of
the comets of 1680 and 1689. The unavoidable uncertainty in the ob-
servations must, however, leave the question of identity unsettled.
The extremely small perihelion distance is worthy of notice, and may,
perhaps, account for the lack of nucleus. Indeed, if we accept the orbit
computed by Dr. Oppenheim (q=0.0047), the comet must have ploughed
through the surface of the sun itself.
Comet 1887 IT: Discovered by W. R. Brooks, at Phelps, New York,
_ == Comet 6 1887. | on the evening of January 22, 1887, in the constella-
tion Draco. In the early part of February it reached its greatest north-
ern declination, 80°, then went south again, and was last observed |
by Plummer at Orwell Park, on April 23. From the time of discovery
it increased gradually in brightness till about the middle of February,
when it was described as a bright telescopic object about 3/ in diam-
eter with well marked central condensation of the tenth magnitude.
According to the yet unfinished investigation of Dr. Stechert the orbit
shows a well-marked ellipticity.

wards the north and west; last observed on April 10, at Orwell Park.
The ordinary formula for brightness, which assumes that the comet
shines by reflected sunlight only, seems to have failed in this case, as in
many others; in the middle of March, when its theoretical brightness
was 0.12 that at the time of discovery, it was apparently as well seen as
during the first days of its appearance.

Comet 1887 IV: Barnard’s third comet of 1887 was discovered at
= Comet e187. 11 o’clock on the evening of May 12, in right as-

cension 15", declination—31°. On May 13 it was described by Boss as
having a star-like nucleus of the 11.5 magnitude. It increased some-
what in brightness till about the middle of June, developing a tail
which attained a length of 5’.. It moved rapidly north, and on account
of its brightness and favorable situation was well observed, till August
11. Mr. Muller has already completed a definitive orbit, and finds that
the observations are represented by an ellipse somewhat better than
by a parabola.

= Comet a 1888. | Hope, on February 18, 1888, or the early morning
of February 19, civil reckoning, the comet being readily seen with the
naked eye, with sharply defined nucleus of the seventh magnitude in

with an opera-glass. The rapid northerly motion brought it, by the
12th of March, into view in the northern hemisphere, where it was fol-
lowed until September, being reported visible to the naked eye until
the first part of May. Thome, at Cordoba, described it as a fine naked-
eye object, with a tail, at its maximum, 5° iv length and a nucleus of
three and one-half magnitude. Remarkable fluctuations occurred in
the brightness of the head, during the months of March and May, re-
sembling the phenomena noted in the great September comet of 1832
and the Pons-Brooks comet of 1834.

On the 19th of March the main eighth magnitude nucleus was seen to
have an eleventh magnitude companion, and on the 27th of the month
a third faint nucleus was detected; the triple nucleus was last seen
on the 4th of June. Between the 19th and 21st of May it became five
or six times brighter than during the days immediately preceding, and
from the nucleus two bright streamers were shot out, curving backward
on either side of the nucleus into the tail. This sudden outburst is al!
the more difficult to account for as it occurred two months after peri-
helion; it is to be regretted that no spectroscopic observations were
obtained at this critical period. The spectroscopic observations made
in March and April showed a faint, broad, continuous spectrum, in ad-

dition to the three characteristic hydrogen bands. The orbit, accord-
ing to Berberich, is undoubtedly elliptic, the period, from his preliminary
computation, being 2,570 years.

helion had taken place some forty-eight days before discovery, but the
increasing distance from the sun was largely compensated for by the
approach to the earth, so that the comet was observed for several
months in 1889,

Comet 1889 I:

Comet e 1833.

This comet was discovered by Barnard at the Lick
Observatory, with a 4-inch comet-seeker, on Septem-
ber 2, 1833, or the morning of September 3, and also independently by
Brooks, at Geneva, on the following morning. It was a round nebulous
mass 1’, in diameter, with a central condensation of 11-12 magnitude
and no tail. At the end of November it reached its maximum bright-
ness, twelve times as bright as at discovery, and appeared to the naked
eye like a nebulous star of the sixth magnitude. It will not pass peri-
helion till January 31, 1889,

The spectrum, according to Dr. Copeland, on November 14, instead
of being composed of the usual feeble separate bands, was continuous,
rather long, extending from wave-lengths 575 to 450 of Angstrém’s Heats
brighter in the middle and fading gradually at both ends; it resembled
the spectrum of a close globular star-cluster or of a non-gaseous nebula,
rather than that of a self-luminous gas. Faint patches of light were
made out in the positions usually occupied by the second and third
cometary bands. Similar observations were made later, and on Decem-
ber 8, all three bands were distinctly visible, but on each occasion the
continuous spectrum formed the ground on which the brighter spectrum
was superposed. ‘It seems probable that the comet shines mainly by
reflected light, - - - to which the action of the sun on the cometary
material is slowly adding the usual bright bands.”

154 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

Prof. Daniel Kirkwood has suggested that certain comets of short
period may have originated within the solar system. Wolf’s comet
(1884 IIL), for example, before its last near approach to Jupiter, had an
eccentricity of 0.28, which is exceeded by twelve known asteroids, and
the elements of Tempel’s comet (1867 II) do not differ greatly from
those of an eccentric asteroid. Out of twenty short-period comets,
seven have disappeared either by dissolution, like Biela’s comet, or by
the transformation of the orbit by Jupiter as in the case of Lexell’s comet.
Five, or, including Encke’s and Biela’s, seven, have periods commensur-
able with that of Jupiter; all have direct motion; all but one have a
smaller inclination than Pallas, and there is a tendency of the perihelia
to concentrate in the 180° (from 290° to 110°), as in the asteroids.

One of the most able of recent contributions to cometary astronomy
is a monograph by Dr. Kreutz upon the orbit of the great September
comet of 1882. In connection with investigations being carried on by
Professor Weiss this will form a complete discussion of the system of
comets with remarkably small perihelion distance, 1843 I, 1880 I, and
1882 II.

Dr. Galle is compiling a catalogue of recent comets embracing the
various supplements to the list given in 1847 in Encke’s edition of
*“ Olbers’ Methode.”

METEORITES.

Researches on meteorites.—Mr. Lockyer presented at the meeting of the
Royal Society on November 17, 1887, a paper giving the results of his
“ Researches on Meteorites,” which has attracted much attention. He
has examined meteoric spectra under various conditions, particularly
that of feeble temperature, and has found it possible to obtain from
meteorites spectra that show the most peculiar features of solar, stellar,
nebular, or cometary spectra. ‘In the spectra of nebulie, for instance,
seven lines have been detected, of which three were traced to hydrogen,
three to low-temperature magnesium, and the seventh, which has not
yet been traced to its originating element, has been given by the glow
from the Dhurmsala meteorite. The most characteristic nebular line
was identified with the low-temperature fluting of magnesium, and the
unusual spectrum obtained from the comets of 1866 and 1867 was
ascribed to the same cause. The changes observed in the speetrum of
the great comet of 1882 were such as would correspond to the changes
induced by the change of temperature in the spectrum of a meteorite ;
and the changes in the spectrum of Nova Cygni, and the bright lines in
such a star as R Geminorum received a similar explanation; while a
very full, in parts almost perfect, reproduction of a considerable portion
of the solar spectrum has been obtained by taking a composite photo-
graph of the are spectrum of several stony meteorites, taken at random
between iron meteoric poles. These and similar observations have led
Mr. Lockyer to regard all self-luminous bodies in the celestial spaces
ASTRONOMY. 155

as composed of meteorites, or masses of meteoritic vapor produced by
heat brought about by condensation of meteor-swarms due to gravity,
so that the existing distinction between stars, comets, and nebul:e rests
on no physical basis. All alike are meteoritic in origin, the differences
between them depending upon differences in temperature, and upon the
closeness of the component meteorites to one another. Nove (new stars
that blaze forth suddenly) are explained as produced by the elash of
meteor-streams, and most variable stars are regarded as uncondensed
meteor-streams. Stars with spectra like that of Alpha Orionis (Rigel)
are considered not as true suns, but as mere clouds of incandescent
stones; probably the first stage of meteoritic condensation. Stars with
spectra of the first and second type represent the condensed swarm in
its hottest stages, while spectra of Secchi’s fourth type indicate an ad-
vanced state of cooling.”

The general conclusions arrived at by Mr. Lockyer may be thus
summarized: All self-luminous bodies in space are composed of me-
teorites variously aggregated, and at various stages of temperature
depending upon the frequency and violence of their mutual collisions.
Comets, nebul, bright-line stars, stars showing banded spectra of the
third type, including most long-period variables, are to be regarded as
veritable meteor-swarms; they are made up, that is to say, of an in-
definite multitude of separate and (in a sense) independent solid bodies,
bathed in evolved gases, and glowing with the heat due to their ar-
rested motions. ‘The existing distinction,” we are told, “between
stars, comets, and nebul rests on no physical basis.” Stars, on the
other hand, of the Sirian and solar types (constituting the only true
“suns”) are vaporized meteor-swarms; their high temperatures repre-
sent the surrendered velocities of myriads of jostling particles, drawn
together by the victorious power of gravity.

“Collisions” are not however exclusively relied upon for the cos- °
mical production of light and heat. It is admitted that the luminosity
of comets and nebule must be largely due to electrical excitement;
nor is any reason apparent why its influence should be restricted to
these two classes of bodies. Destruction of movement by impacts ean
scarcely be made to supply its place. Occasional illuminative effects
may be derived from it, but none that are uniform and permanent.

The small bodies which, more or less plentifully distributed, appear
to pervade space, are in this theory treated as the fundamental atoms
of the universe. But it is evident that we can not begin there. They
have a history, marked perhaps by strange vicissitudes. They may be
agents of regeneration, but they are almost certainly products of de-
struction. Possibly they are seed as well as dust, and serve as the
material link between the creation and decay of successive generations
of suns. .

The orbits of meteorites.—Prof. H. A. Newton, of Yale College, has
carefully studied the evidence available for determining the “former
156 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

orbits of those meteorites that are in our collections and that were seen
to fall.” Of these stone-falls there are three classes: (a) 116 falls for
which we have statements as to the direction of the path through the
air; (b) 94 falls of which we know the time of day; (c) 50 or more falls
of which the history is too scanty to give the time of day. He is led
to the following three propositions:

1. The meteorites which we have in our cabinets, and which were
seen to fall, were originally (as a class and with a very small num-
ber of exceptions) moving about the sun in orbits that had inclinations
less than 90°; that is, their motions were direct, not retrograde.

2. The reason why we have only this class of stones in our collections
is not one wholly or even mainly dependent upon the habits of men;
nor on the times when men are out of doors; nor on the places where
men live; nor on any other principle of selection acting at or after the
arrival of the stones atthe ground. Hither the stones, which are mov-
ing in the solar system across the earth’s orbit, move in general in direct
orbits, or else for some reason the stones which move in retrograde
orbits do not in general come through the air in solid form.

3. The perihelion-distances of nearly all the orbits in which these
stones moved were not less than 0.5 nor more than 1.0, the earth’s
radius-vector being unity. (Observatory 11: 331.)

At the meeting of the Royal Society, November 15, 1888, Prof. G. TH.
Darwin read an important paper dealing with the mechanical conditions
of a swarm of meteorites from a mathematical stand-point.

SOLAR SYSTEM.

Motion of the solar system in space.—Dr. Ludwig Struve has made a
careful comparison of the Pulkowa catalogues for 1855 with Auwer’s
re-reduction of Bradley (epoch 1755), and, as one of his results, has ob-

SUN.

Rotation time of the sun.—Mr. Crew, of Johns Hopkins University,
has made a new determination of the time of revolution of the sun ou
its axis by comparing the wave-lengths of certain lines in the spectrum
when measured in light coming from two opposite limbs of the sun. By
Doppler’s principle the wave-length of the line in light from the ap-
proaching limb ought to be shorter than in the light from the receding
limb. The results obtained give a velocity of the photosphere at the
sun’s equator of 2.437 miles per second; from this the rotation time is
determined to be 25.88 days. Mr. Crew’s observations indicate an in-
crease in the angular velocity of the surface with increase in the helio-
graphic latitude. This result is opposed to that obtained by Carrington
and Spoerer from observations of sunspots.
158 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Dr. Wilsing has found the rotation period from observations of faculze
to be 25.23, and has detected no variation in velocity depending upon
the latitude. The difficulty of identifying faculee on their reappearance,
and of measuring their positions with exactness, makes the result some-
what doubtful.

Diameter of the sun—Dr. Auwers has made a very exhaustive dis-
cussion of the sun’s horizontal and vertical diameters from the meridian
observations of Greenwich, Washington, Oxford and Neuchatel with
special reference to the alleged variations in the mean annual diameters
following the period of the sunspot cycie. He concludes that there is
no valid reason for supposing the sun’s diameter to vary, and that the
apparent changes arise from insufficiently determined personal equa-
tions. Healso points out that meridian observations are quite unsuited
for the determination of any possible ellipticity in the sun’s disk, and
that there is no reason to conclude from these results that such ellip-
ticity exists. The several mean values of the sun’s (assumed circular)
diameter are:

Wiashinotomeyas se soce eee Neuchatelre ccs... -2 02 13: ol.

The discordances are ascribed to instrumental or uneliminated per-
sonal peculiarities.

In a second paper Dr. Auwers discusses the apparent changes of both
the horizontal and vertical diameter during the course of a year, de-
duced from meridian observations, and he coneludes that the periodic
variations in the monthly value of the diameters result not from
physical changes in the sun, but from the effect of temperature on the
instruments and from difference in the quality of the telescopic images
at opposite seasons of the year.

Another discussion of the horizontal diameter of the sun has been
made by Professor di Legge from meridian transits of the sun observed
at Campidoglio from 1874 to 1883. The mean horizontal diameter at
mean distance deduced from 5796 transits by four observers on 2213
days is 32/ 2/38.

Solar activity in 1887, 1888.—The decrease in spots, faculze and promi-
nences which was so marked during 1886, and particularly during the
latter part of that year, continued in 1887, and although there was no
spotless period as long as that of November, 1886, the mean spotted
area for the year was much below that of the year preceding. The days
of greatest spotted area were July 6,7, and 8. The agreement in the
geueral form of the curves for spot numbers and magnetic variation
was not so close as in some previous years. The fluctuations in the num-
bers and dimensions of the prominerces were less than for the spots,
but they also showed a maximum in July. Facule accorded well with
the prominences, neither facule nor prominences following the spots in
the marked depression of November.
ASTRONOMY. 159

‘During 1888 spots were few, small and in low latitudes, and there
were frequent intervals in which no spots at all were seen, longer inter-
vals in fact than any since the minimum of 1879. The most prolific
month as to entire spotted area, though not as to number of spots, was
November, following immediately a long period of quiescence. There
was a rough tendency of spots to certain solar longitudes and in lati-
tude, they continued to be more numerous in the southern than in the
northern hemisphere. Facule did not vary simultaneously with spots,
but their diminution as compared with 1886 and 1887, was slight. They
showed a very noticeable development during the secondary maximum
of September, while the prominences fell off considerably both in Sep-
tember and November, but attained their greatest development in
March and April.

Solar spectrum.—Experiments made by Professor Trowbridge and
Mr. C. C. Hutchins at the Jefferson Physical Laboratory in Cambridge,
have overthrown the proof brought forward in 1879 by Dr. Henry Dra-
per of the existence of oxygen in the sun. They show that when suf.-
ficiently powerful apparatus is used to bring out minute details of the
spectrum of oxygen and of the sun, the bright regions of the solar spec-
trum disappear, and hence also the apparent coincidences between them
and the spectrum of oxygen upon which Dr. Draper based his proof.
The bright bands obtained by Dr. Draper are in fact occupied by num-
erous dark lines of variable intensity.

Continuing their experiments however they have been led to con-
clude that there is unmistakable evidence of the existence of carbon in
the sun.

In a valuable paper by Mr. C. C. Hutchins and Mr. E. L. Holden,
evidence is brought forward to show the probable existence in the sun
of bismuth, silver, and platinum, while tin potassium, and lithium are
more doubtful. For cadmium two perfect coincidences were found,
while there was no good evidence in favor of the presence of lead
cerium, molybdenum, uranium or vanadium.

Prof. S. P. Langley has published in the American Journal of Science
an abstract of a memoir on the invisible solar and lunar spectrum, in
which he summarizes the result of investigations carried on at the Al-
legheny Observatory in continuation of his previous researches on the
infra-red of the solar spectrum to the extent of about three microns.
By means of the improved apparatus described, the extreme infra-red
solar spectrum has now been searched from three to over eighteen mic-
rons; and it is shown that in this region the ratios between solar and
lunar heat are completely changed from what they are in the visible
spectrum. While the solar light in the latter is about five hundred
thousand times that of moonlight, the solar heat received in the invisi-
ble part of the spectrum is probably less than five hundred times the
lunar. These studies also promise important results for meteorology,
by opening to observation the hitherto unknown region of the spectrum,
160° -. RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

in which are to be found the nocturnal and diurnal radiations, not only
from the moon towards the earth, but from the soil of the earth towards
space. (Nature.)

Total eclipse of the sun, August 19, 1887.—Unusual preparations were
made throughout Kurope for observing this eclipse, and great popular
interest was manifested in the event, but, unfortunately, very few ob-
servations of value were obtained on account of the generally cloudy
weather that prevailed over the whole region west of the Ural moun-
tains. The central line of the eclipse first struck the earth at a point
53 miles west-northwest of Leipsic, where the sun was just rising. The
line of totality, which was about 135 miles wide, then crossed Germany,
Russia, Siberia, China and Japan, and left the earth at a point in the
Pacific Ocean in latitude 24° 27’ north, longitude 173° 30’ east.

Eclipse of the moon, January 28, 1888.—The total eclipse of the moon
on January 28, 1888, presented an unusually favorable opportunity for
observing the occultations of a large number of faint stars, and, in
order to secure as many observations of these phenomena as possible,
Dr. Dollen, of Pulkowa, prepared and sent out to the principal observa-
tories in Eurepe and America, a list of the stars to be occulted at each.
He reports that he has reveived three hundred and ninety-six observa-
tions of disappearances and three hundred and eighty-seven of re-ap-
pearances, the places of observation being so favorably situated, that
he considers that there is ample material for determining the position,
the diameter, and possibly the ellipticity and parallax of the moon.

SOLAR PARALLAX AND THE TRANSITS OF VENUS.

Professor Harkness, at the meeting of the American Association in
Cleveland on August 20,1888, gave a description of the instruments
and reduction processes employed by the United States Transit of
Venus Commission in determining the solar parallax from the measure-
ment of photographs taken at the ten American stations in December,
1882; Washington, Cedar Keys, San Antonio, Cerro Roblero, Prince-
ton, and the Lick Observatory, in the United States; Santa Cruz and
Santiago, South America; Wellington, South Africa, and Auckland,
New Zealand. The preliminary value of the parallax deduced from the
measured distances of the centres of the sun and of Venus on 1,475
photographs is z=8”.84740".012. The American photographs in 1874
gave z=8".883+ 0.034, and the French z=8”.80. The distance of the
sun corresponding to the value now obtained—8”.847—is 92,385,000
miles, with a probable error of only 125,000 miles. These numbers are
doubtless close approximations to the results which will be obtained
from the complete discussion of all the photographs, but they cannot
be regarded as final for several reasons, chief among which is the fact
that the reduction of the position angles of Venus relatively to the
sun’s center is still unfinished.

The report of the committee appointed to superiutend the arrange-

ASTRONOMY. 161

ments for the expeditions sent out by the British Government to ob-
serve the transit of Venus in 1882 has been published. It consists
almost entirely of a discussion by Mr. Stone of the observations of con-
tact. Expeditions were sent from England to Jamaica, Barbadoes,
Bermuda, Cape of Good Hope, Madagascar, New Zealand, and Bris-
bane, Queensland, and the observers at all these stations were success-
ful, except at Brisbane, where the weather was cloudy. It will be
remembered that the English committee did not feel satisfied with
the photographic work in 1874, and for various reasons they deter-
mived in the second transit to put their reliance entirely upon contact
observations. From the observations of external contact at ingress
Mr. Stone obtains a parallax of 8,/’7404+0".122; from those of internal
contact at ingress, 8.823+0/.023; from those of internal contact at
egress, 87.8554 0.036, and from external contact at egress 8.9534
0.048. The most probable combined result he considers to be 8/.852+
0.024, which corresponds to a mean distance of 92,510,000+ miles
between the earth and sun, with an uncertainty of 250,000 miles.

The fourth volume of the report of the German Transit of Venus
Commission was published in 1887, under the editorship of Dr. Auwers.
It contains the observations in detail made with the heliometer by
various observers, both before and after the transits of 1874 and 1882,
for the purpose of determining the instrumental constants.

The report of the Brazilian expeditions has been printed in a quarto
volume of 700 pages. Three stations were occupied: St. Thomas, in
the Antilles; Olinda, Brazil; and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of
Magellan. The transit was observed by projecting the sun’s image
forined by an equatorial refractor of 6.3 inches aperture upon a screen
and noting the times of contact. The result given for the value of the
parallax from the internal contacts is 8/’.808.

Professor Hall, using a value of the coustant of aberration 20/.4542,
deduced from a series of observatious of a Lyrae, made at the U.S.
Naval Observatory during the years 1862 to 1£67, and introducing
Michelson and Newcomb’s determination of the velocity of light, has
found for the solar parallax 8/”.810 + 0.0062.

PLANETS.

MArs.—The observations of Perrotin, Terby, and Denning have con-
firmed the presence of most of the so-called ‘‘ canals,” or narrow, dark
lines, that were discovered by Schiaparelli in 1877, and at subsequent
oppositions, and in some cases the gemination or doubling of the canals
has been detected.

Considerable interest has been aroused in regard to Mars on account
of the recent changes reported in the markings upon its surface by
Perrotin and others. The chief change reported was the apparent in-
undation or disappearance of the “ triangular contiuent,” to which the
name of Libya has been assigned, but che report has not beea confirmed

by the observations of Schiaparelli, Terby, Niesten, and Holden. The
observations of Professor Holden and his assistants with the 36 inch
refractor began on July 16, 18388, and were continued to August 10;
‘the planet was therefore very unfavorably situated, its diameter being
less than 9’. Several of the most important canals were seen, but they
were not double, appearing rather “as broad bands covering the spaces
on M. Sehiaparelli’s map which are occupied by pairs of canals and by
the spaces separating the members of each pair.” Professor Hall, with
the Washington 26-inch refractor, has never been able to see these
markings so sharply drawn by European observers. ‘The only remark-
avle change he noticed was the diminution in the size of the white spot
at the south pole of the planet.

Numerous sketches of Mars showing the canals or other markings
have been published by Holden, Perrotin, Terby, and Niesten. No ad-
equate explanation of the canals, or of the changes observed, has yet
been offered.

J UPITER’S SATELLITES.—Astronomers have always been puzzled by
the discordant appearances of the satellites during transit, but more
especially by the fact that the phenomena do not apply equally to all the
satellites, or even in some instances to the same satellite in two succes-
sive revolutions. The fourth, for instance, as it approaches the disk of
Jupiter becomes rapidly fainter till it arrives at contact. When once
on the limb it shines with a moderate brillianey for about ten or fifteen
minutes, then becomes suddenly lost to view for a similar period, and
lastly reappears, but as a dark spot, which grows datker and darker
until it equals the blackness of its own shadow on the planet. The ap-
pearance of the second satellite, however, is entirely different, for it
seems never to have been seen otherwise than pure white during transit;
whereas the first and third differ yet again from the preceding two.
The former is sometimes a steel-gray, and at others a little darker,
whereas the latter has been seen perfectly white and yet so black as to
be mistaken for the fourth. Mr. KE. J. Spitta has made a careful investi-
gation of these interesting phenomena, communicating his results in a
paper of some Jength, read at the meeting of the Royal Astronomical
Society, in November, 1887. His experiments consisted essentially of
numerous observations upon suitably prepared models representing the
planet and satellites, and he concludes (see Nature 37:468, March 15,
1888) that the probable reason the fourth satellite is uniformly black
during transit, when it has passed its period of disappearance, is, that
its albedo is so low as to grant the difference between it and the back-
ground necessary for a body to appear black when superimposed on an-
other. Its preliminary whiteness and disappearance are also shown to
be a question of relative albedo, for they are due to the fact that asphere
at its limb loses so much in reflective power that up to that moment
the satellite possesses sufficient albedo (as compared with the back-
ground in that situation) to maintain its whiteness, So, too, with the sec-
ASTRONOMY. 163

ond satellite. Its albedo proves to be so high that it is capable of pre-
serving its brillianey throughout the entire transit.

The third and first satellites evidently possess sides of different al-
bedo, one high enough to maintain a brighter aspect than the other, or
even, as in the case of the third, to make it appear white when one side
is presented to the earth and dark when the other. Finally, to quote
from the original paper, “it is not unreasonable to conelude that these
anomalous phenomena are due to functional idiosyncrasies in the eye
itself, rather than to physical peculiarities of the Jovian system.”

Mr. Denning has obtained from observations of the red spot made
between February 12 and August 22, 1888, a rotation of 9° 55™ 408.24,
nearly one second less than the spot gave in 1885-86, though six sec-
onds greater than in 1879.

The value obtained for the mass of Jupiter by von Haerdtl in his dis-
cussion of Winnecke’s comet is 1: 1047.152 + 0.0136.

SATURN.—-The first number of a new series of publications called
Supplements to the Pulkowa Observations contains an interesting me-
moir by Dr. Hermann Struve on the outer satellites of Saturn. He dis-
cusses his own observations made with the 15-inch refractor in the
years 1884-1886 on Iapetus, Titan, Rhea, and Dione, with a view to
correcting the elements of these satellites, and also the values of the
mass and ellipticity of Saturn. The mass of Saturn was found by Bes-
sel to be 1 : 3501.64 0.77, or with a slight correction indicated in the pres-
ent paper, 1: 3502.5. Prof. Asaph Hall, on the other hand, obtained the
value 1: 3481.3+0.54. Struve considers the rather large discordance be-
tween these values due to systematic error in measuring the distance
of a satellite from a limb, and his own observations consist entirely of
comparisons of one satellite with another, either by differences of right
ascension and north polar distance or of distance and position angle.
His resulting value of the mass of Saturn agrees closely with Bessel’s,
being 1: 3498. The correction of the elements has been carefully and
laboriously carried out by the method of least squares. (The Observa-
tory, 11: 303, July, 1888.)

Mr. G. W. Hill,in his paper on the motion of Hyperion and the mass
of Titan, has obtained for the latter 1: 4714, Saturn’s mass being unity.
Newcomb’s corrected value, and Ormond Stone’s value, accord well with
this.

URANvs.—Dr. Valentiner, of the Karlsruhe Observatory, and his as-
sistant, Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz, were able to detect in April, 1857, a
slight ellipticity in the disk of the plavet Uranus, but their instrument,
a 6-inch equatorial, was not of sufficient power to make satisfactory
measures.

NEP1 UNE.—Tisserand has shown that the progressive changes in the
node and inclination of the orbit of the satellite of Neptune can be ex-
plained by supposing a slight flattening of the surface of the planet;
but the flattening would probably be too slight to be measured, Fur-
164 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

ther observations may enable the amount of the inclination to be more
exactly determined, and at the same time will show whether the changes
in question are due to this cause alone.

THE MINOR PLANETS.—Seventeen of these small bodies were added
to the group during the years 1887 and 1888, making the total number
now known 281.

The new discoveries, with approximate elements, are given in the
following table. All except number 270 were below the eleventh mag-
nitude, and some slight confusion at first occurred in the numbering,
owing to the difficulty of distinguishing a new asteroid from one
already known in the absence of a very carefully computed ephemeris.
For instance, numbers 268 and 279 were at first thought to be identical
with 149, Medusa; 277 with 228, Agathe; 280 with 255, Oppavia; while
an asteroid detected by Luther on April 11, 1887, and independently by
Coggia on April 16, proved to be 69, Hesperia, which had been looked
for in vain in 1882 and 1885; and one found by Borelly on May 12, 1888,
to which the number 278 was assigned, though it was suspected to be
identical with 156, Xanthippe, eventually proved to be 116, Sirona.

Number 265 is remarkable on account of the very considerable in-
clination of the plane of its orbit to that of the ecliptic, and also on
account of its near approach to the earth, its least distance from us
ASTRONOMY. 165

being 0.96, in terms of the earth’s mean distance from the sun; if
would therefore seem to offer an additional means of determining the
value of the solar parallax. Number 270 also approaches quite near
the earth, A=0.81. It will be noticed that 279, with its mean distance
from the sun of 4.25, considerably greater than that of any other aste-
roid, lies upon the extreme outer limit of the group, and will at certain
times, therefore, be brought quite close to Jupiter, and by the pertur-
bations thus experienced may furnish further knowledge of the mass
of that planet. Number 281, with its small mean distance of 2.19 lies,
on the other hand, near the inner border of the group; it is the sixty-
eighth asteroid discovered by Dr. J. Palisa.

_ Prof. Tietjen discontinues with the year 1888, the regular issue of the
Cireulars and Correspondence of the Berlin Jahrbuch, relating to as.

discovered planets presenting interesting peculiarities.

The Annals of the Harvard Observatory, volume 18, No. 3, contains a
discussion of a series of photometric observations of the asteroids by
Mr. H. M. Parkhurst, extending from April to December, 1887. The
method of observation was to note the time that the asteroid took to
disappear after passing a transit wire, the telescope being stationary,
and the light of the asteroid or comparison star suffering diminution
either by a wedge or more frequently by a deflector—a piece of glass
with nearly parallel sides placed in the telescope tube, about one-sev-
enth of the way from the focus to the object glass, and covering half
the field. The conclusions reached by the author are as follows:

(1) The phase correction can not be neglected, and is peculiar to each
asteroid.

(2) There may be, for certain asteroids, large errors from rotation.

(3) In most eases, after the phase correction has been determined, the
remaining unknown errors are less than the average variation of the
fixed stars.
166 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

REPORTS OF OBSERVATORIES.

In collecting the following notes upon observatories the latest avail-
able information has been utilized, but it has been found impossible to
biing the report in each case down to the end of 1888. The Viertel-
jahrsschrift, for instance, from which the data for many European ob
servatories are drawn, contains reports no later than 1887, and compar
atively few observatories publish independent annual reports. The
writer’s thanks are due to Sr. Felipe Valle for notes on the observatories
of Mexico.

Ann Arbor.—Prof. W. W. Campbell has been appointed assistant to
fill the vacancy made by the removal of Mr. Schaeberle to the Lick Ob-
servatory.

Armagh.—Dr. Dreyer has devoted a large part of his time to the pre-
paration and passing through the press of a new general catalogue of
nebule.

Bamberg.—An interesting description of the new observatory is given
in the Vierteljahrssehrift for 1887, p. 333, by the direetor, Dr. E. Hart-
wig. The sum of $45,000 was available for buildings, $17,500 for in-
strnments, the interest on $20,000 for salaries, and on $12,500 for main-
tenance, with a reserve fund of about $20,000. The observatory con-
sists of two buildings, the observing-rooms being in one and the offices
and dwelling in the other. In the first there are two towers surmounted
by domes and connecting them is the transit room. <A long covered
way from the dwelling gives easy access to the instruments. . The latter
are a 7-inch Repsold-Merz heliometer similar to the one at the Cape, a
10 ineh refractor, a Repsold-Merz transit with zenith-telescope attach-
ment, 6-inch Merz comet-seeker, clocks, chronometers, and subsidiary
apparatus.

Basel (1886).—The astronomical observatory and meteorological sta-
tion are under the direction of Dr. E. Hagenbach- Bischoff, assisted by
Dr. Riggenbach. The instruments are used principally for the deter
mination of time and for the instruction of students.

Beloit.—The equipment of the Smith Observatory, Beloit College,
which was built in 1883 and ready for work in 1884, consists of an
equatorial refractor of 94 inches aperture, objective by Clark, mount-
ing by Warner and Swasey; a combined transit and zenith telescope
of 2.6 inches aperture, made by Prof. C. S. Lyman (see Amer. Jour. Se.,
XXX, p. 52); clocks, sidereal chronometer, chronograph and minor ap-
paratus, and meteorological and photographie outfit. Directors: John
Tatlock, jr., 188485; C. A. Bacon, 1885. A local time service is main-
tained, and meteorological observations are published daily.

Berkeley, California.—The “Students’” observatory of the University
of California, established in 1887, is designed to furnish to under grad-
uates instruction in geodesy and the more practical parts of astronomy
generally; as rating clocks and chronometers, determining geographical
ASTRONOMY. 167

latitudes and longitudes, etc. It is also designed to encourage study,
on the part of the more advanced under-graduates, of astronomical
phenomena, as far as they may be within the reach of young amateurs.

A neat and sufficiently commodious observatory building, 50 feet long
by 20 feet wide, on the average, has been built on a knoll in the univer-
sity grounds 320 feet above mean sea-level. In the dome-room, at the
east end of the observatory, is an equatorial refractor of 64 inches clear
aperture, objective (achromatic), by J. Byrn, of New York, the mount-
ing, driving-clock, pier, etc., being by Fauth & Co., of Washington.
With this telescope are six negative and as many more positive eye-
pieces, and a fine position filar micrometer made by the same firm. A
spectroscope, capable of attachment to the equatorial or of being used
on a stand, is furnished with a flint prism, and also with one of Row-
lands diffraction gratings, having 14,334 lines to the inch.

In the room next west are two of J. Green’s standard barometers, and
in a. specially prepared shed upon the north side, a wet bulb, adry bulb,
a maximum, and also a minimum thermometer, by H.J. Green, of New
York. In this shed is also placed one of Draper’s self-registering ‘‘ ther-
mographs.”

On the northwest tower of the College of Letters are mounted a Rob-
inson anemometer and a wind-vane. These instruments are connected
by telegraph wires with an anemograph in the observatory, where the
velocity and direction of the wind are automatically recorded. Meteor-
ological observations and records are made at 7 A. M., 2 P. M., and 9 P.
M. (Standard or mean time of the 120th meridian of longitude). Monthly
printed reports are made to the U.S. Signal Service office in San Fran-
cisco.

In the next room west is mounted a fine, large, portable * transit and
zenith telescope,” of the type used by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic
Survey, but having an objective 3 inches in diameter.

Two diagonal and two direct eye-pieces belong to this instrument.
In the same room is a Howard Standard mean time clock, with grav-
ity escapement, mercurial compensating pendulum, and electric circuit
connections. The clock is fastened to a solid granite pier 15 inches
square and 6 feet long, which is inclosed ina brick pier reaching to solid
rock 5 feet below the surface of the ground. The transit and equatorial
‘are similarly founded. All the piers are disconnected from the floors of
the observatory. A sidereal chronometer, made by Negus Bros., New
York, is mounted upon one side of the transit pier.

On a shelf at one side of the transit-room is an electro-chronograph,
by Fauth & Co., of Washington, and on another the switch-board made
by the San Francisco Electric Company. An electric circuit runs
through the clock, chronometer, chronograph, sounder, and relay, and
also into the equatorial-room, from which time may be marked on the
chronograph by means of a break-circuit key. .The switch-board is con-
nected with the Western Union telegraph line by a shortline to Dwight
Way-Station, Berkeley.
168 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

The tworooms further west are used respectively as a repair shop and
a sleeping-room for the assistant.

In a small house at the rear of the observatory, upon a brick pier spe-
cially made for the purpose, are mounted three seismographs, the Du-
plex, the Ewing rotating, and the Gray.

The latitude of the mereury basin in the center of the transit pier of
the observatory has been found from the first series of observations (pre-
liminary to a continued series) to be + 37° 52/ 21.7. Longitude west
of Greenwich 8" 9™ 28,52.

The observatory is in charge of Prof. Frank Soulé, professor of civil
engineering and astronomy, University of California.

Berlin.—The principal work of the meridian circle has been upon the
Pulkowa list of stars and Argelander’s stars, with considerable proper
motion; a few comparison stars were observed, and preliminary experi-
ments made to determine the influence of brightness of stars upon the
observed time of transit. The 9-inch equatorial has been employed upon
comets, asteroids, and comparison stars, and the declinograph attached
to this instrument in observing zones in the thicker parts of the milky-
way. With the smaller meridian instrument a series of observations of
comparison stars has been begun, and with the heliometer measures of
double stars and the Pleiades. In the annual reports of this observa-
tory, given by Professor Foerster in the Vierteljahrsschrift, will be found
interesting notes upon the performance of the clocks and time service.

The Recheninstitut, under Professor Tietjen, has published, as usual,
the Jahrbuch, and circulars relating to the minor planets.

Bonn.—Dr. Schoenfeld reports satisfactory progress of the observa-
tions and reductions of zone +40° to +50°. The remaining charts of
the Southern Durchmusterung have been completed and distributed,
and an investigation of errors in star catalogues -covered by these
charts is approaching completion. A few observations of variables
have been made. Dr, Ménnichmeyer succeeded Dr. Scheiner as assist-
ant on January 1, 1887, the latter having accepted a position at Pots-
dam.

Bordeaux.—The second volume of Annales, published in 1887, con-
tains a memoir by Flamme upon elliptic motion of the planets, a deter-
mination of the latitude by Rayet, and a series of observations made
with the meridian circle for a revision of Oeltzen’s catalogue of Argel-
ander’s southern stars; also magnetic and meteorological observations.

sreslau.—Observations mainly meteorological and magnetic, and for
the time service.

Brighton (Massachusetts) —Mr. E. F. Sawyer, of Cambridgeport, has
removed to Brighton, upon the outskirts of Boston, and continues his
observations of variables.

Brooklyn (New York).—Mr. H. M. Parkhurst’s private observatory
was originally built in 1862 and provided with a 6-inch telescope. It
was rebuilt in 1877 and a 9-inch refractor was mounted. A series of
ASTRONOMY. 169

photometrie observations made by Mr. Parkhust has been published
in the Harvard Observatory Annals, vol. 18, No. 3.0 Approximate
position, latitude, +40° 41’ 2”; longitude, 4" 55™ 508.1 west of Green-
wich.

Brussels.—A catalogue of 10,792 stars upon which work was begun
more than thirty years ago by Quetelet has at length been finished.
M. Stuyvaert is engaged upon the formation of a catalogue of compari-
son-stars, which have appeared in volumes 107 and 108 of the Astrono-
mische Nachrichten. Double stars, comets, and occultations by the
moon have been observed with the equatorials of 38 and 15 centimeters,
and numerous physical observations of the moon and planets have also
been made. M. labbé Spée is especially occupied with a study of solar
spots and protuberances, and M. Fievez with the study of the solar
spectrum. The new observatory at Uccle is practically finished.

Cambridge (England).—Considerable progress has been made with the
zone +25° to +30°.

Camden (New Jersey).—Mr. E. BE. Reed has erected a small private
observatory, with 6-inch equatorial.

Cape of Good Hope—With the transit-circle regular observations
have been continued of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, stars on the list of
the Cape ten-year catalogue for 1890, comet comparison stars, stars
occulted by the Moon, stars employed in the latitude and longitude
determinations of the Geodetic Survey, and stars employed in zones
for determining the scale value of the heliometer. The large theodolite
has been used for observations of circumpolars and latitude stars, the
zenith telescope for latitude, and the equatorial for observations +of
comets. The photographic ‘‘Durchmusterung” is proceeding rapidly,
the instrument being kept at work by two observers from evening
twilight till dawn. The reduction of the plates from declination —90°
to —774° has been completed by Professor Kapteyn, and plates for
measurement to —57° have been sent to him. It is expected that the
photographs will be completed by the end of 1889; tieir reduction
will probably require two years longer. The new heliometer was re-
ceived from Repsold, and mounted in the latter part of 1887; it is
pronounced by Dr. Gill the most powerful and convenient instrument
for refined micrometric research at present in existence. A complete
working programme has been prepared, including the determination of
the parallax of all the southern stars brighter than magnitude 2.0 and
all the stars most remarkable for proper motion. Some progress has
been made in the determination of the constants of the instrument.
The meridian observations for 1882, 1883, and 1884, occultations ob-
served from 1835 to 1880, forming vol. 1, part 4 of the Annals, and a
discussion of the variations of the instrumental adjustments of the
transit-circle have been published.

Carleton College.—An illustrated description of the building and in-
struments is given in the Sidereal Messenger for October, 1888, The
170 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

length of the building east and west is 80 feet, north and south 106
feet. The clock-room is on the first floor of the main building, and is
27 feet in diameter. The large circular pier for the 16-inch equatorial
(to be constructed by Brashear) is in the middle of this room, suttably
cased to a height of 74 feet, and provided with shelving. The mean-
time and sidereal clocks, both by Howard, are mounted in recesses in
the east and west faces of this pier. In the west wing, upon the same
floor, is the library with about 1,400 bound volumes, a small study or
class-room, and a janitor’s room; to the north is the prime vertical of
3-inch aperture (Fauth), and beyond this a class and lecture room. A
small dome over the north wing covers the 8} inch Clark refractor. In
the east wing is mounted a fine Repsold meridian circle of 4.8 inches
aperture, which is under the charge of Dr. H. C. Wilson. The chrono-
graph, chronometer, and time-distributing apparatus are in the clock-
room, <A time-service over more than 12,000 miles of railway is under
the immediate care of Miss C. R. Willard.

The co-ordinates of the observatory provisionally adopted are (Astron.
Nachr. 120:85): latitude +44° 27/ 41”; longitude 6" 12™ 368.0 west of
Greenwich. ;

Cincinnati.—A zone catalogue of 4,050 stars observed with the 3-ineh
transit was published in 1887. In September, 1888, a new meridian cir-
cle, by Fauth & Co., was mounted, one of the first large instruments of
this class made in the United States. The clear aperture of the object-
glass is 51 inches, and the focal length 70 inches; object-glass and mi-
crometer are inter-changeable. The piers are of masonry to the floor-
level, and from there up an iron frame work bricked inside to within a
foot of the top. The pivots are of steel, glass hard. There are two solid
circles, 24 inches in diameter; one is divided very coarsely to half de-
grees only: the other has two sets of graduation upon a silver band,
both of them to 5’. The inner one is somewhat heavier than the other,
and does not pretend to great accuracy, being used merely for setting.
The outer graduation alone is visible in the reading miscroscopes; as far
as Professor Porter has carried his investigation the errors of this grad-
uation are very small. Electric illumination has been used throughout
and has been found practically perfect. A detailed description of the
instrument will be found in the Sidereal Messenger for January, 1889.

Cointe ( Liége).—Observations of Titan and Japetus have furnished a
determination of the mass of Saturn. The meridian circle has been used
for zone observations.

Copenhagen.—Mr. Nielsen has recently erected a private observatory
with a 65 inch refractor by Reinfelder & Hertel, intended principally
for selenographical work.

Cordoba.—V olumes 6 and 9, containing the zone observations made in
1875 and 1876, have been published.

Dearborn.—The report for 1885 and 1886, which has not previously
been noticed, contains a list of nebula discovered by Professor Safford
ASTRONOMY. nA

in 1866~68; papers on the motion of the lunar apsides and on the com-
panion of Sirius by Professor Colbert; and an illustrated paper on the
physical aspect of Jupiter, a catalogue of 209 new double stars, and a
description of a printing chronograph by Professor Hough. In the
course of the two years referred to 130 new double stars were discov-
ered and measured.

In consequence of the dissolution of the University of Chieago the
Chicago Astronomical Society dismounted their instruments in the
early part of 1888, and transferred the care of the observatory to the
Northwestern University, at Evanston, Illinois, 12 miles from the busi-
ness center of Chicago, about 16 miles north and 3 miles west of the old
site, and some 300 feet from the shore of Lake Michigan. The corner
stone of a new building, the gift of James B. Hobbs, was laid June 24,
1888. The plan includes a tower and dome for the 184-inch equatorial,
meridian circle room, library, and about eight rooms for other purposes;
the whole to be erected at a cost of $25,000. The approximate position
is given: Latitude, +42° 3’; longitude, 5" 50™ 428 west of Greenwich.

Denver.—A. new observatory, the gift of Mr. H. B. Chamberlin to the
University of Denver, is being built, about 7 miles from the city of
Denver, at an altitude of 5,000 feet above sea-level. The principal
jostrument is to be a 20-inch Clark refractor. Director, Prof. H. A.
Howe.

Dresden.—Baron von Engelhardt’s older observatory was built in
1877? (latitude, +51° 2/31; longitude, 0" 54™ 538.3 east of Greenwich),
and contained an 8-inch Grubb equatorial, a 2-inch Cooke transit, and a
sidereal clock by Knoblich. The present observatory was built in 1879
somewhat nearer the outskirts of Dresden (latitude, +-51° 2’ 19’; longi-
tude, 0" 54” 548.7 east of Greenwich). It consists of a three-story tower,
the upper story being surmounted by a cylindrical ‘‘ dome” covering a
12-inch Grubb equatorial. The second floor connects with the transit-
room, in which is a “ broken-back” transit, by Bamberg, of 2.7 inches
aperture. There is also a very complete equipment of subsidiary appa-
ratus, clocks, chronometers, chronograph, etc. Upon the adjoining roof
of the baron’s residence is a little comet observatory arranged for two
instruments, one of 6.4 inches aperture and the other of 3.7 inches. The
larger instrument, which is similar to the Strassburg comet-seeker, is
of somewhat novel construction. The telescope is fastened by two long
aris to the back of a chair so that the eye-end comes at a convenient
position for the observer; the arms are pivoted to the chair-back, per-
mitting a motion in altitude, while the chair may be rotated in azimuth,
so that the astronomer can examine the whole sky rapidly and without
fatigue.

The numerous and valuable observations of occultations, phenomena
of Jupiter’s satellites, comets, planets, new stars, nebulae, and clusters
were collected and published in the latter part of 1886, together with an
illustrated description of the observatory and instruments. Similar ob-

servations have been continued during the past two years, and consider-
able progress has also been made with a series of micrometrie measures
of all stars in Bradley and Argelander, which have an annual proper
motion of at least 0.1, with companions not below the tenth magnitude,
and distance not greater than 3’.

Dresden (K. math. Salon).—Meteorological observations and a local
time-service.

Dunecht.—Spectroscopie work has consisted of measures upon stars
and nebule and a study of the low-sun atmospheric lines, as seen from
an observing station established upon a neighboring hill. Circulars of
astronomical information, the weekly firing of the time-gun, and the
dailf meteorological observations have been continted as in former
years. A catalogue of the library is in press.

Dunsink.—The meridian circle has been devoted to observations of a
list of about 1,000 stars suspected of large proper motion. Part vt of
“Observations” was issued in 1888, containing the observations from
1881 to 1885 made with the meridian circle on 1,012 stars of the south-
ern Durchmusterung requiring re-observation.

Diisseldorf.—Observations of comets and asteroids and ephemerides
of the latter. :

Ealing.—Mr. Common has completed his 5-foot reflector.

Edinburgh.—Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth resigned in August, 1888, the ap-
pointments (which he has held since 1846) of regius professor of prac-
tical astronomy in the University of Edinburgh and astronomer Yoyal
for Ireland, and he has given a very discouraging account of the finan-
cial condition of the institution. Dr. Ralph Copeland, of the Dun Keht
Observatory, has been appointed as his successor.

Geneva.—In addition to the regular work of rating chronometers and
watches, observations have been made of comets, of nebule, and of the
rings of Saturn. <A series of observations made by Plantamour and
von Oppolzer, in 1881, for the purpose of determining the difference of
longitude between Geneva and Vienna, have been discussed, giving a
mean value of the difference of longitude of 40™ 44°.64 (Geneva west of
Vienna).

Geneva (New York).—Mr. William Smith built in 1888 a small private
observatory, which he has placed in charge of Mr. W. R. Brooks, well
known for his discoveries of comets. The instrumental equipment is
as follows: equatorial refractor, objective, by Clacey, of 104 inches
aperture and 9 feet 9 inches focal length, with a photographie corrector
of the same aperture. The mounting is by Warner & Swasey, and em-
bcdies numerous convenient devices. There is a large Gundlach peri-
scopic comet eye-piece of 3 inches equivalent focus, with a silvered flat
diagonal of 34 inches, a position micrometer, polarizing eye piece, uni-
versal Brashear spectroscope fitted with grating and prisms, and suited
for stellar, solar, or laboratory work. The meridian circle is by Warner

_
ASTRONOMY, Lia

& Swasey, 4-inch aperture and 40-inch focus, with 16-inch circles: one
circle is coarsely divided, the other is divided to 5/ and is read by two
microscopes to 1’. The sidereal clock was made by the Self-winding
Clock Company, of Brooklyn, New York; it has Gerry’s patent gravity
escapement, and is automatically wound by a small electric motor. The
chronograph was designed and constructed by the director. Outside
the observatory proper, but ready for occasional use, are the 9-inch,
5-inch, and 3-inch reflectors, also built by Mr. Brooks, and used by him
at Phelps, New York, in searching for comets.

Georgetown (District of Columbia).—The observatory of Georgetown
College (built in 1845) was placed under the charge of Father J.G. Hagen,
S. J.,in the winter of 1888. The buildings and instruments, which
have been but little used for nearly forty years, have been thoroughly
renovated at considerable expense. Father Hagen has not as yet laid
out any plan for the future work of the institution.

Glasgow (Scotland).—Observations with the transit circle of a list of
stars in the earlier volume of Weisse’s Bessel.

Glasgow (United States),—See Morrison Observatory.

Gohlis.—The private observatory of Herr Winkler was transferred
in 1887 from Gohlis, near Leipzig, to the neighborhood of Jena—latitude,
+50° 55/ 35.6; longitude, 0° 46™ 208.8 east of ‘Greenwich.

Gotha.—Considerable progress has been made in the reduction of the
zone observations (25°—20°). With the meridian circle observations
of moon culminations and of stars of Mayer’s catalogue have been
made, and with the equatorial, observations of comets, of asteroids,
and of Gore’s variable near y! Orionis.

Dr. Becker has, at the request of Professor Newcomb, collected in a
convenient form Hansen’s formule for the general perturbations by
Jupiter and has applied them to the planet Eurynome. It will be re-
membered that Prof. J.C. Watson made provision in his will for the
computation of tables of the asteroids discovered by him, which will
readily give the places of the planets at future oppositions. Dr. Becker’s
work is for the purpose of facilitating these computations.

Dr. Paul Harzer succeeded Dr. Becker as director on December 1, 1887.

Gottingen (1886).—Dr. Schur assumed charge of the observatory on
April 1, 1886, and immediately set to work to have much needed and
very extensive repairs made in the buildings and instruments. As most
of the instruments have been dismounted, the principal work done has
been upon a new reduction of the zone observations made by Klinker-
fues from 1858 to 1863. A 6-inch Repsold heliometer has been ordered.
The personnel of the observatory consists (with the director) of obsery-
ator, Dr. Battermann; assistant, Herr Clemens, and computer, Heidorn.

Greenwich.—The regular meridian observations of the sun, moon, and
major and minor planets have been kept up as before, and satisfactory
progress has been made with the reductions for a new ten-year cata-
logue (187786). Observations of the moon have been made with the
174 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 18838.

altazimuth, and of comets with the equatorial. The spectroscopic ob-
servations for determining the motions of stars in the line of sight, the
photoheliographic record of the sun’s surface, the magnetic and meteoro-
logical observations, the chronometer and time service are also contin-
ued as heretofore. A crown disk for the 28-inch objective, has, after
several failures, been obtained by Grubb from Chance & Co., and the
Treasury has granted the necessary funds for a 13-inch photographie
telescope to enable the observatory to take its share in the scheme for
forming a photographic map of the heavens. Numerous experiments
have been made in stellar photography in preparation for this work.
An 18-foot dome for a photographic equatorial was built in 1838, and
at the same time an addition was made to the space available for com-
puting rooms. The annual volume for 1886 has been printed and dis-
tributed. We learn that provision has been made for a redetermina-
tion of the difference of longitude between Greenwich and Paris. The
astronomer royal in his last report draws attention to the recently
averted danger from a proposed railway tunnel within 840 yards of the
observatory. He also points out the inadequacy of the present staff to
handle properly the ever increasing amount of work demanded from a
national observatory, as new fields of research are opened up for in-
vestigation.

Grignon.—Sketches of the planets, observations of meteors, meteoro-
logical observations, and microscopical studies of cosmical dust. Di-
rector, Fr. Mayeul Lamey.

Grinnell.—lIowa College has a small observatory, for instruction, with
an 8-inch Clark refractor, mounted in April, 1888.

Guadalajara (Mexico).—Private observatory of Ingeneiro Carlos F. de
Landero; latitude, + 20° 40/ 31.9; longitude, 6" 53™ 23°.66 west of
Greenwich.

Haiphong (Tonkin).—The longitude of the small observatory as tele-
graphically determined by connection with Hong Kong April 5, 6, 7,
1887, is 7" 6™ 448.04 east of Greenwich.

Harrow.—The work of determining the places of comparision stars
and other selected small stars has been continued with the meridian
circle. Observations of comets have been made with the equatorial.

Harvard.—Professor Pickering describes the progress of his work
under three principal heads: The older instruments of the observatory,
the Draper memorial, and the Boyden fund. The 15-inch equatorial has
been used upon comets, eclipses of Jupiter satellites, and photometric
observations of asteroids. The meridian cirele zone catalogue is pass-
ing through the press, and some progress has been made in observing
the new zone, —9° 50’ to —14° 10’... The work upon which the meridian
photometer has been employed since 1882 was finished September 29,
1888. The most laborious part of this work was the determination of
the brightness of stars of the ninth magnitude in zones 20 minutes in
width at intervals of 5 degrees from the north pole to the deciination
ASTRONOMY. 175

—20°. This instrument has been dismounted and sent to Peru, where
the work will be continued to the south pole, and in order to extend the
investigation from stars of the ninth to stars of the fourteenth magni-
tude, an instrument of somewhat similar form but with an objective of
12 inches aperture (described under Instruments) has been mounted at
Cambridge.

The first extensive research undertaken with the Henry Draper me-
morial funds, a catalogue of the spectra of 10,875 stars, covering the en-
tire sky north of —25°, is nearly completed. This work has been done
with the 8-inch Bache telescope. A second series of photographs made
with longer exposures, and so taking in fainter stars, will soon be tin-
ished, and this instrument will likewise be sent to Peru, where the ob-
servations will be extended to the south pole. The detailed study of
the brighter stars with the 11-inch Draper telescope has been continued,
and the 15-inch and 28-inch reflectors constructed by Dr. Draper have
been mounted and are employed in studying the spectra of variables.

The Boyden fund has been devoted to collecting necessary informa-
tion in regard to the meteorological conditions at high altitudes, and in
furtherance of this object several stations in Colorado were occupied —
during the summer of 1887 by a party from the observatory provided
with special photographic apparatus. In December, 1888, a fully
equipped expedition went out to California to observe the total solar
eclipse on January 1, 1839, and having successfully completed that task,
they proceeded to the southern hemisphere to occupy for several years
an elevated station in Peru, and to earry out the photographic and
photometric work mentioned above.

The compilation of observations of variable stars, the telegraphic
announcement of astronomical discoveries, and the time service have
been continued asin previous years. Volume 18 of the Annals is issued
in parts in order to provide prompt publication for special investiga-
tions. These, as well as the Draper-memorial Reports, have received
notice elsewhere. The Bulletin of the New England Meteorological
Society and a good deal of other meteorological work will also appear
in the Annals. The observatory buildings have been increased by the
addition of two neighboring houses, and also by the erection of small
detached and inexpensive buildings to cover the different telescopes
that have been added to the equipment.

Haverford.—Founded in 1852, enlarged in 1883, Instruments: 10-
inch refractor, by Clark; 84-inch refractor, re-ground, by Olark; 54-inch
silver-on-glass reflector; 13-inch zenith telescope. Directors: Joseph G.
Harlan, 1853; Samuel J. Gummere, ; Samuel Alsop, jr., 1875; Isaac
Sharpless, 1882; Francis P. Leavenworth, 1887. Professor Leaven-
worth has published a number of observations of comets,

Helsingfors.—The 7-inch refractor has been used for observations of
comets, both determinations of position and eareful examination of
physical characteristics. The transit instrument has been re-modelled

by the Repsolds and provided with a circle 48 centimeters in diameter,
divided to 2/ and read by four microscopes.

Halifax —Observations of the phenomena of Jupiter’s and Saturn’s
satellites, occultations, and transits of stars for time.

Herény.—The chief work has been on celestial photography. Photo-
graphs of numerous star-clusters, of the moon, planets, comets, and of
stellar spectra have been obtained.

Hurstside, West Molesey, England.—Sir Henry Thompson has built a
private observatory with a 12-inch Cooke equatorial, to which is fitted
a photographic objective and large prismatic objective for photograph-
ing stellar spectra.

Kalocsa.—A careful series of observations of solar phenomena is
carried on by the director, Father Julius Fépyi.

Kew.—Magnetic, meteorological, and solar observations, verification
of instruments, and the rating of watches and chronometers have been
continued.

Kiel—The zone catalogue, +55° to +65°, containing 14,680 stars,
was finished and prepared for press in 1887. The Kiel observatory is
the central station for the telegraphic distribution of astronomical in-
formation upon the continent, and in connection with this service con-
siderable work has been done upon the new comets and asteroids by
members of its staff.

Konigsberg—bservations of the sun and major planets, of time
stars and comparison stars, have been made with the Repsold circle;
observations of double stars, comets, and measures for stellar parallax
with the heliometer. The director, Dr. E. Luther, died October 17,
1887, and was succeeded April 1, 1885, by Dr. C. F. W. Peters.

Kremsmiinster.—The meridian circle has been repaired and remounted
in a new building 4.023 north and 0°%.22) west of its old position.
Comet observations have been made with the refractor.

La Plata.—Observations of comets by M. Beuf and his assistants
have been published. The position of the observatory is given as,
latitude, —34° 54’ 30.3; longitude, 45 0™ 58*.0 west of Paris. (Compt.
Rend., 106: 1590.) The construction is progressing rapidly, and when
completed this will be one of the best equipped observatories in the
southern hemisphere.

Leipzig (University Observatory).—The zone observations +5° to
+15° are practically finished. A new Repsold heliometer of 162 milli-
meters aperture was mounted in 1886, and is described, together with
its new dome, at some length in Dr. Bruns’ report for 1887; an impor-
tant addition to the working force is Herr ‘“* Mechaniker” Lohm.

Leipzig.—Dr. Engellman devoted most of his time to measures of
double stars.

Lick.— Au important event of the year 1888 was the transfer, on June
1, of the Lick Observatory to the regents of the University of Cali-
fornia. The equipment of the Lick Observatory las been previously

described in these reports and elsewhere, but it may not perhaps be su-
perfluous to recapitulate briefly here, referring for details to Vol. 1 of
the observatory publications, or to an article by Professor Holden in
the Sidereal Messenger for February, 1888. The mounting of the 36-
inch equatorial is referred to at some length in the present report under
the heading ‘“‘ INSTRUMENTS.”

The main observatory building is 287 feet long, including the 75 foot
dome at its southern end, and contains a hall 12 feet wide running the
whole length, offices and computing rooms, the library, clock-room,
visitors’ room, ete., and at the northwest corner stands the 25-foot dome
for the 12-inch equatorial. The other buildings on the mountain sum-
mit are the meridian-cirele house, transit-house, photoheliograph, lab-
oratory, several temporary workshops, and the dwelling for the astrouo-
mers. The instrumental equipment consists of the 36-inch, 12-inch,
and 64-inch equatorials, 4-inch comet-seeker, 6 inch meridian-cirele,
4-inch transit and zenith telescope, 2-inch universal instrument, photo-
heliograph, declinograph, five clocks, several chronometers, four «chro-
nographs, and minor apparatus. The cost of the instruments with their
mountings and transportation, aggregated about. $200,000; buildings
and other expenses amounted to about $375,000; Ieaving in the neigh-
borhood of $125,000 for a permanent endowment fund. In addition to
what may be derived from the investment of this sum, the-observatory
is to be allowed for its maintenance as a department of the University
of California the sum of $19,188 a year. The astronomieal staff con-
sists of Ii. S. Holden, director and astronomer; S. W. Burnham, J. M.
Schaeberle, J. EH. Keeler, EH. . Barnard, astronomers; C. B. Hill, assist-
ant astronomer, secretary, and librarian. The first volumetof “Publi-
cations” appeared before the real work of the observatory nad begun,
and it is, therefore, mainly historical and descriptive. It contains Mr.
Lick’s deeds of trust, Professor Newcomb’s report on glass for object-
ives, Mr. Burnham’s reports upon the site in 1879 and 1881, -descrip-
tions of the buildings and instruments, an account of theengineering
and building at Mount Hamilton in the years 1880-1885, observations
of the transit of Mercury in 1881 and of Venus in 1882, geological re-
ports, meteorological observations, 1880-1885, and an extensive series
of reduction tables for the latitude of the observatory. There have
been published in scientific journals and in the daily press interesting
notes upon nebuize and planetary markings as shown by the 36-inch
refractor, and the discoveries of new comets and double stars. Pro-
fessor Holden attributes the steady-seeing at Mount Hamilton to the
coast fogs, which roll in from the sea every afternoon in the summer,
rising 1,500 to 2,000 feet, covering the hot valley and preventing radia-
tion fromit. The nights of summer and autumn—April to October or
November—are found to be excellent both as to clearness and steadi-
ness; the daylight hours are less satisfactory, and in winter the seeing
is not much better than at lower altitudes.

178 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 18838.

Litchfield.—Dr. Peters is still at work upon his ecliptic charts; he
expects to issue shortly a second installment of twenty.

Liverpool.—The time-gun has been fired with regularity, chronome-
ters tested, and meteorological observations conducted as heretofore.

Lund.—Dr. Dunér has continued his observations of variable stars
and spectra of red stars, and with a large solar spectroscope, provided
with one of Rowland’s gratings, he has made an important investigation
of the period of rotation of the sun. Photographs of the solar spectrum
were made as a check upon the micrometer measures.

Lyme Regis.—See Rousdon.

McCormick.—The 26-inch equatorial is still devoted chiefly to the
study of nebulae. Mr. Leavenworth resigned as assistant in September,
1887, to take charge of the Haverford College observatory. Professor
Stone expresses continued satisfaction with the electric illumination of
the equatorial.

Madras.—Mr. Norman R. Pogson has published in two volumes tle
results of a series of observations of star places made with the 54-inch
meridian circle, the first volume giving, after a brief history and deserp-
tion of the observatory, the “separate results” and annual catalogues
for 1862, 1863, and 1864, and the second volume “separate results” and
annual catalogues for 1865, 1866, and 1867.

Mauritius.—Principal activity is in the observation of meteorological
and magnetic phenomena, and in the photographie record of the state
of the solar surface by means of the photoheliograph.

Mazatlan (Sinaloa).—Founded in 1879 and intended principally for
the time Service, and is supported by the department of public works.
Its directors have been: Ingo. Fiacro Quijano, 1879~84; L. Gutierrez,
1854; F'. Weidner, 1884; C. Camifia, 188587; L. Acosta, 1887. Instru-
ments: Meridian instrument, by Fauth & Co., aperture 0™.076 (3 inches),
focal length 0,787 (31 inches); equatorial, by W. Gregg, New York,
0™.15 (6 inches), aperture; Troughton & Simms altazimuth, and Negus
chronometer. Latitude, +23° 11/ 22.81; longitude, 7" 5™ 355.67 west of
Greenwich.

Melbourne.—The mirrors of the 4-foot Cassegrainian reflector have
become so tarnished as to interfere materially with the observation of
the fainter nebule. The sum of $5,000 has been appropriated to enable
the observatory to take part in the stellar photographie scheme of the
Paris conference.

Mexico.—The Central Astronomical Observatory in the city of Mex-
ico was founded in 1878, It is intended for purposes of instruction,
and especially for co-operating in geodetic work and for maintaining
the time-service of the capital. The principal instruments are a
meridian telescope, by Troughton & Simms, of 0".069 aperture and
1™.16 focus; a zenith telescope, by the same makers, of 0.076 aperture
1™.22 focus ; an altazimuth, by the same, with 0.305 (12-inch) circles; a

two Bliss break-circuit chronometers, several mean-time chronometers,
and a fillet chronograph. The director has also under his charge the
geodetic, topographic, and astronomical instruments of the department
of public works. Position of the observatory: Latitude,+19° 26/ 1.3;
longitude, 6" 36™ 315.5; altitude, 2,285™.4 (7,500 feet). Directors: Sr.
Ingeneiro Geografo Don Francisco Jiminez from 1878 till his death,
November 4, 1881, when he was succeeded by Sr. Don Leandro Fer-
nandez.

Milan.—A new 18-inch refractor, objective by Merz, mounting by
Repsold, was put in place in 1886, and has been devoted principally to
the measurement of double stars. The smaller (8 inch) equatorial has
been used for observations of comets and of double stars in rapid
orbital motion. The markings on Mars were examined with both in-
struments.

Morrison observatory was established in 1875 through the efforts
of the present director, Prof. C. W. Pritchett, aided by the liberality
of Miss Berenice Morrison, whose name the institution bears. The
principal instruments are a 124-inch Clark equatorial and an excellent
6-inch Troughton & Simms meridian circle, similar in plan to the me-
ridian circle of the Harvard Observatory. The first number of the
publications is a well printed volume of 111 pages, giving an account
of the founding of the observatory, a full description of the building
and instruments, and the observations in detail. The latter consist
mainly of measures of double stars, observations of planets, comets,
occuitations by the moon, ete. A full discussion is given of the geo-
graphical co-ordinates of the meridian pier, the longitude being deter-
mined by an exchange of signals with Washington in 1880. There are
several drawings of the observatory, and sketches of Saturn and of
comets. The work is now much restricted owing to the inadequacy of
funds.

Munich.—The zone observations with the meridian circle are con-
tinued, and a‘new Munich catalogue is going through the press. The
10-inch refractor has been used for observations of Comets, measures
of stars in the cluster h Persei, and observations for stellar parallax.
Some photometric observations have also been made.

Natal.—Recent work has been largely in meteorology. The obser-
vatory has been seriously crippled by the lack of funds,

Nice.—The first volume of the annals is to contain a description of
the observatory and instruments, and is expected shortly; the second
volume has already been published, and the third volume, also in
preparation, will contain Thollon’s study of the solar spectrum. Vol:
2 is devoted mainly to the determination of the co-ordinates of tke ob-
servatory and to measures of double stars. There are also observations
of comets and planets, and notes on solar spectroscopy and the red-
glows. The position of the observatory at present adopted is: Latitude,
+ 43° 43’ 16.9; longitude, 0" 19™ 51%.22 east of Paris.

180 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

North Carolina University.—Professor Love, of the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, has called attention to an early attempt
to establish an astronomical observatory in the United States which
seems to have remained unnoticed by astronomers. Professor Cald-
well, the president of the university, went to Europe in 1824 to pur-
chase books and apparatus, and spent the greater part of $3,361.35 for
astronomical instruments; this was four years before the purchase of a
telescope by Yale. The foundations of the observatory were laid in
1831, and the building was finished in 1832, six years before the Hop-
kins Observatory at Williams. There was but one room, 15 feet by 25
feet and about 25 feet high. A Simms transit of ern aper.ure and
44-inch focus was mounted upon a masonry pier in this room, and a
Simms altitude and azimuth instrument upon a pier projecting through
the roof and covered by a small house moving on rails. The observa-
tory possessed also a 24-inch (52-inch foeus) Dolland refractor, an astro-
nomical clock by Molyneaux, reflecting circle, sextant, and quadrant.
The instruments were removed from the observatory owing to a leaky
roof, soon after Dr. Caldwell’s death, in 1835, and in 1838 the building
was partly destroyed by fire, and astronomical activity was never re-
newed, All records of observations have been lost.

Oakland.—The private observatory of Mr. F. G. Blinn, in East Oak-
land, contains a 5-inch Clark equatorial and 13-inch Latimer-Clark tran-
sit, with mean-time and sidereal clocks.

Oakland.—The observatory of Mr. Burckhalter, at West Oakland,
California, contains a 10-inch reflector by Brashear, and 13-inch transit.
The mechanical work of the building and equatorial mounting ‘vas done
by the owner.

O’ Gyalla.—Observations of sun spots, spectroscopic and photometric
observations of planets, new stars, comets, and stars with variable
spectra. The observations for a ‘ spectroscopie Durechmusterung ”
from 0° to -15° declination have been finished and the catalogue
printed. Dr. von Kévesligethy, Dr. von Konkoly’s assistant, accepted
a position in the meteorological office in Budapest, April 1, 1887. Con-
siderable spectroscopic and photographic apparatus has been added
to the equipment.

Omaha, Nebraskaa—A new observatory at Creighton Gollan was
completed in 1887. The instruments are a 5-inch Steward equatorial,
d-inch Fauth transit, clocks, chronograph, ete. Director, J. Rigge, 5.
J. Latitude, +41° 16’ 6”; longitude, 6" 23™ 478 west of Greenwich.

Orwell Park.—An extensive and valuable series of observations of
recent comets has been published.

Oxford University.—Great attention has been paid to photography,
and particularly to its application to the determination of stellar par-
allax (q. v.), with very gratifying results. The large equatorial is to be
re-modelled as a photographic telescope of 13 inches aperture in con-
formity with the plans adopted by the Paris congress, the necessary
funds having been provided by Dr. De La Rue.
ASTRONOMY. 181

Palermo.—Obdservations of comets, planets, sun spots, and meteors.

Paris.—The approaching completion of the observations for the La-
lande catalogue has modified the plan of operations carried on with the
meridian instruments for some years past. The large transit circle
has been used for observations of the sun, moon, minor planets, and
such stars of Lalande’s list still requiring re-observation; the Gambey
transit, for observations of the absolute right ascensions of fundamental
stars; the Gambey circle and the ‘“‘cercle du jardin,” for a re-investiga-
tion of the latitude, and the latter also for fundamental declinations.
Comets, asteroids, nebulz, and occultations of stars by the moon have
been observed with the equatorials. The most important addition to
the instrumental equipment is the apparatus adapted to the equatorial
coudé for determining the constants of refraction and aberration by
Loewy’s method. Work in astronomical photography is continued by
the Henrys. A fine engraving of the Pleiades, compiled from three of
their photographs, accompanies Admiral Monchez’s report for 1887.
The time service, which of late has not been entirely satisfactory, is
undergoing renovation.

Paris (Ecole militaire).—M. Bigourdan gives in the Bulletin Astro-
nomiqnue (4: 497; 5: 30) an interesting historical account of the ob-
servatories of the Ecole militaire, famous for the labors of Lalande and
VA gelet.

Pekin.—An interesting historical account of this observatory (estab-
lished in 1279) is given in abstract, in Nature for November 8, 1888.

Phelps (New York).—The Red House Observatory was abandoned in
1888, Mr. Brooks having become director of the Smith Observatory at
Geneva.

Poona.—An observatory has been established at the College of Science
with a 163-inch silver-on-glass Newtonian reflector by Grubb, 6-inch re-
fractor by Cooke, with photographic, photometric, and spectroscopic
accessories. It is intended at present to restrict the work of the obser-
vatory to certain branches of spectroscopic research, with occasional
observations of comets, ete. The curator is Mr. K. D. Nacgamvala.

Potsdam.—Dr. Vogel has applied photography to the determination
of the motions of stars in the line of sight, and has obtained most satis-
factory results. He proposes to observe regularly all stars (about sixty)
that are as bright as 2.5 magnitude. The observations of solar phenom-
ena, sketches, and photometric observations of comets and planets have
been continued with little interruption. Progress is reported upon the
“photometric Durchmusterung,” which is to take in all stars in the
northern hemisphere down to the 7.5 magnitude. The instruments re-
quired to enable the observatory to take part in the photographie work
planned by the Paris congress have been ordered, and numerous pre-
liminary experiments have been carried out for the permanent commit-
tee of that body.

Prague.—Professor Safarik has continued his observations of variable
182 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

stars. In 1887 he changed his residence, and made considerable im-
provements in his observatory. The instruments are a 6-inch refractor,
which is to be replaced by one more powerful, and a small transit and
clock. The provisional co-ordinates of the meridian room are: latitude,
+509 4’ 21’; longitude, 0" 57™ 48° east of Greenwich.

Puebla (Mexico).—Observatory of the College of the Sacred Heart.
Director, P. Capelleli, 8. J.

Pulkowa.—The great routine work of the observatory, the determina-
tions of star positions with the transit, meridian cirele, and vertical cir-
cle has proceeded on the same lines as before. Romberg is credited
with having made no less than 9,000 observations with the meridian
circle in a single year. The 30 inch refractor has been used on close
double stars and satellites, the 15-inch on similar work, and also for
experiments in stellar photography. The astro-physical laboratory is
reported in working order. Volume 12, a catalogue of the principal stars
to the fourth magnitude, as far as —15° declination, has been published,
and several other volumes, though interrupted by the death of Wagner,
are well advanced. The first number of a new series of publications—
‘¢ Supplements to the Pulkowa Observations”—is an interesting memoir
by Dr. Hermann Struve on the outer satellites of Saturn.

Radcliffe—The transit circle has been used for observing the sun,
moon, and a list of stars down to the seventh magnitude between the
equator and —25°; the Barclay equatorial for the measurement of double
stars and observations of comets. The volume for 1885 has been pub-
lished, and all reductions are remarkably well advanced.

Rousdon.—Systematic observation of some twenty long-period varia-
bles has been taken up; time signals are furnished for the neighboring
district.

Scholl Observatory.—At Lancaster City, Pennsylvania, a new observ-
atory, named the Daniel Scholl Observatory, has been erected on the
grounds of Franklin and Marshall College. The equipment as described
by Mr. J. E. Kershner in Science for May 13, 1887, consists of an 11-inch
Clark-Repsold equatorial, a 3-inch transit, a Seth Thomas clock, a chro-
nometer, chronograph, and meteorological apparatus. The equatorial
has a set of positive and negative eye-pieces, with reversion prisms for
three of the micrometer eye-pieces, a Mertz solar eye-piece, and a comet
eye-piece, together with a micrometer and complete illuminating appa-
ratus for bright and dark field, as worked out by the Repsolds.

Smith College (Northampton).—An exchangs of longitude signals with
the Harvard Observatory was made in the summer of 1888.

Stockholm.—Dr. Gyldén has devoted himself to investigations in ce-
lestial mechanies.

Stonyhurst College.—tThe solar observations consist of (1) a drawing
of the sun’s disk, 104 inches in diameter, including the careful delinea-
tion of all spots and faculie visible; (2) a spectroscopic measurement
with a radial slit of the height of the chromosphere and of all the gas-
ASTRONOMY. 183

eous prominences; (3) a study of the general surface of the sun when-

ever the definition has been unusually good; (4) a sketch of the chro-
-mospheric flames, with a wide tangential slit; (5) the spectrum of the
solar spots between the lines B and D. Observations of lunar occulta-
tions, of comets, and of the phenomena of Jupiter’s satellites have been
made as before. The sky-glows have also been watched with care. A
54-inch Clark equatorial, formerly the property of Rev. T. W. Webb,
was purchased for the observation of the total solar eclipse of August
29, 1886.

Strassburg.—Dr. HK. Becker was appointed director December 1, 1887,
relieving Dr. Kobold, the ‘observator,” temporarily in charge. Ob-
servations of nebulz, comets, and satellites have been made with the
refractor; observations of the sun, moon, and planets and of zero stars
for the southern zones with the meridian circle, and measures of the
sun’s diameter and sunspots with the heliometer. The transit instru-
ment has been used by Dr. Wislicenus for investigations with a per-
sonal equation. apparatus of his own design. All reductions are well
advanced. The library has been thoroughly overhauled and recata-
logued.

Syracuse (New York),—The new observatory of the University of
Syracuse, @ memorial to Charles Demarest Holden, of the class of 1877,
was dedicated November 18, 1887, with an appropriate address by Pro-
fessor Newcomb. The instruments are an 8-inch Clark equatorial, 5-inch
Troughton and Simms transit, clock chronograph, and chronometer.
Director, Prof. J. R. French.

Syracuse (New York.).—Private observatory of H. P. Stark; 5,5;-inech
Spencer equatorial refractor; 12-foot dome.

Tacubaya.—The National Mexican observatory, which is in the de-
partment of the secretary of public works, was founded May 5, 1878,
The instruments were at first mounted at Chapultepec, but in 1885 they
were transferred to the present building, erected at a cost of $200,000.
The instruments are as follows: A refractor of 0™.581 (15 inches) aper-
ture and 5™.40 (17 feet 8 inches) focal length, by Grubb, provided with
a fine micrometer and an 11-prism spectroscope; a meridian ecirele of
0™,203 (8 inches) aperture and 2™.743 (9 feet) focal length, by Trough-
ton & Simms, with circles 0™.914 (36 inches) in diameter, divided to 5/
and read by four microscopes, and with collimators of 0".152 (6 inches)
aperture and 2™.15 (7 feet) focus; a Dallmeyer photoheliograph of
0™.102 (4 inches) aperture and 1™.53 (5 feet) focus, with parallactie
mounting and an enlarging apparatus; an alt-azimuth, also by Trough-
ton & Simms, of 0™.083 (34 inches) aperture and 0™.85 (2 feet 9 inches)
focal length, with circles 0™.60 (2 feet) in diameter, divided to 5’. In
addition to these there are, not yet mounted, a Grubb equatorial of
0™.152 (6 inches) aperture and 2™.54 focal length, an Ertel meridian in-
strument of 0".152 aperture and 2”.20 foeal length, and a Troughton
& Simms zenith telescope, 0.076 aperture and 1.14 focal length. Of

subsidiary apparatus there is a cylindrical chronograph, Barraud &
Lund; a fillet chronograph, made in 1867 by direction of Commodore
Maury; asidereal clock, by I’. Vazquez, Mexico; sidereal and mean-time
clocks, by Barraud & Lund; two sidereal chronometers, by Negretti &
Zambra; seven mean time chronometers, by various makers, and mag-
netic and meteorological instruments. A photographic refractor of
0™.33 (13 inches) aperture and 3™.43 (11 feet) focal length has been or-
dered from Grubb, to enable the observatory to co-operate in the inter-
national plan of charting the sky by photography. The personnel con-
sists of Sr. Ingeneiro Angel Anguiano, director; Sr. Ingeneiro Felipe
Valle, Sr. Lieut. Col. Teodoro Quintana, Sr. Ingeneiro Francisco Rodri-
guez Rey, Sr. Apolonia Romo, Sr. M. Moreno; two more astronomers
will be added during 1889. The work of the meridian circle has been
upon comparison stars, comets, and asteroids; the 15-inch equatorial
has been used upon comets, and asteroids, and these bodies, as well as
a list of southern nebul, will be carefully observed in future. The
photoheliograph has been used almost daily, and with the alt-azimnth
observations for time and latitude have been made, and observations of
Junar culminations and of comets. Considerable time has been devoted
to co-operating with longitude parties. The position of the observatory
is: Latitude, +19° 24’ 17/5; longitude, 6" 3°™ 468.53 west of Green-
wich (determined telegraphically from St. Louis); altitude 2,322™ (7,618
feet), An “anuario” is published regularly.

Taucubaya.—Private observatory of M. G. Prieto: Bardou equatorial,
0™.11 (44 inches) aperture, 1.60 (5 feet 3 inches) focal length; spectro-
scope, and clock.

Taschkent.—The refractor has been used for observations of sun-spots,
comets, and occultations by the moon; the meridian circle, principally
for determining the positions of comet comparison stars. The observa-
tory has co-operated in determining the geographical positions of a num-
ber of places in central Asia. Several chronometers have been tested,
and the noon signal has been given by the discharge of a cannon, as in
previous years. The director, M. Pomerantzeff, is assisted by MM.
Zalessky and Schwarz. A new determination of the latitude in 1887
gave: p=+41° 19’ 31/.3540/'.05.

Temple observatory (Rugly).—Spectroscopic observations of the motion
of stars in the line of sight, and measures of double stars.

Tokio.—An observatory was founded in 1888 at Tokio, Japan, by
combining the astronomical departinent of the old Marine observatory,
the observatory of the Ministry of the Interior, and that of the Impe-
rial University. The new observatory occupies the buildings of the
Marine observatory, its position as provisionally determined being lati-
tude, +35° 39/17’.5; longitude, 9" 18™ 588.0 east of Greenwich. The
principal instruments are a 54-inch Repsold transit, a 5 inch Merz and
Repsold meridian circle, and equatorials of 64 and 8 inches aperture.
The director is H. Terao.
ASTRONOMY. 185

Turin.—Observations of comets, meteorological observations, and a
determination of the latitude of a station at Terimoli have been pub-
lished.

United States Naval Observatory.—The work of 1887~88 was similar
to that of previous years. With the 26-inch equatorial observations
were made of double stars, satellites, and of Saturn and Mars, and
observations for stellar parallax; with the 9.6-inch, observations of
comets and asteroids. The observations with the transit-circle for a
catalogue of miscellaneous stars were completed in 1888, and prepara-
tions have been made for observing with this instrument the zone —14°
to —18°, The time-service has been considerably extended. The con-
tract for the erection of the nine buildings comprising the new obser-
vatory was awarded in 18*8, and some progress has been made with
the necessary excavations.

Upsala.—Dr. Hermann Schultz describes at some length in the Vier-
teljahrsschrift (23: 144) the recent additions to his instrumental outfit:
a transit and a vertical circle, both by Repsold, with objectives of 95™™
(4 inches) aperture; a transit, by Steinheil, of 54" (2 inches) aper-
ture, mounted in the prime vertical; a 4inch refractor, parallactie
mounting, by Simms; clock Hohwii 34, three chronometers, two chrono-
graphs, and minor apparatus. The principal instrument of the obser-
vatory is a 9-inch refractor.

Vassar College.—Miss Mary W. Whitney has been appointed to fill
the vacancy caused by the resignation of Miss Maria Mitchell.

Vienna ( Wien-Ottakring).—The private observatory of Herr von Kuff:
ner, which was begun in 1884, was completed in 1837. The building is
in the shape of a cross, 82 feet from east to west and 61 feet from north
to south. The instruments are: A meridian circle, by Repsold, of 4.8
inches aperture and 5 feet focal length, with circle 21.6 inches in diam-
ter, divided to 2’ and read by four microscopes; and a refractor, also
by Repsold, of 10.6 inches aperture and 124 feet focal length, with
filar, double image, and ring micrometers. The position of the obser-
tory, as provisionally determined by Dr. Herz, is: Latitude, +45° 12/
47.2; longitude, 1° 5™ 115.1 east of Greenwich.

Washburn.—The fifth volume of publications contains the observa-
tions made with the meridian circle by Miss Lamb and Mr. Updegraft
from the latter part of 1886 to April 1, 1887, observations made with
the 153-inch equatorial, and a summary. of meteorological observations
made by various observers at Madison from 1=53 to 1886. Miss Lamb
contributes a very useful index to stars in Airy’s six Greenwich cata-
logues not found in Flamsteed, and Mr. Updegraff a discussion of the
latitude of the observatory. Professor Davies was sueceeded by Prof.
G. C. Comstock as director, and Prof. Asaph Hall as consulting director.
Mr. Updegraff and Miss Lamb (now Mrs. Updegraff) have removed to
the Cordoba observatory. The assistants now at the observatory are

Mr. H. V. Egbert, formerly of the Albany observatory, and Prof. 8. J.
Brown. The free use of the Washburn observatory was tendered to
the Navy Department during the contemplated removal of the naval
observatory to its new site.

West Point.—A new observatory was built i in 1883, the old site having
been rendered worthless as an astronomical station By a railroad tunnel
cut immediately beneath it. The instruments are a 12-inch Clark equa-
torial, mounted in 1884, and an 8-inch Repsold meridian circle, mounted
in 1885. Geographical position: Latitude, +41° 23/ 22.1; longitude,
45 55™ 508.6 west of Greenwich. Height above sea level, 480 feet.

Williams College.—On the 28th of June 1888, the fiftieth anniversary
of the dedication of the Hopkins Observatory of Williams College was
celebrated with suitable ceremony and a discourse upon The Develop-
ment of Astronomy in the United States,” by Prof. T. H. Safford. The
Hopkins Observatory seems entitled to the honor of being the first
permanent American observatory, having -been projected about 1834,
chiefly built in 1837, and dedicated June 12, 1838. The University of
North Carolina bad built an observatory in 1831 and provided an ex-
cellent instrumental equipment, but in 1838 the building was partially
destroyed by fire, and little or no astronomical work was ever done with
the instruments. Professor Safford published in 1888 a catalogue of
the right ascensions of some 261 cireumpolar stars, the results of sev-
eral years’ labor with the Repsold meridian circle.

Wilmington, Delaware.—The private observatory of Francis G. du
Pont is at his residence about 4 miles to the north of Wilmington,
Del? It was designed by the owner, and consists of two polygonal
buildings, covered by domes of peculiar construction, and connected
by a third building, which forms the transit room. The instruments
are: A good 12-inch reflector by Brashear, well mounted, with driving-
clock, ete.; a 44-inch equatorial refractor, objective by Clark and
mounting by Brashear; a small transit by Horne & Thornethwaite,
London; sidereal aud mean time clocks, and Morse register for record-
ing transits. The whole building is lighted by the electric light, and
the electric light is also used for instrumental illumination. The 12-
inch reflector has been used for astronomical photography. The
approximate latitude is +39° 16’.

Windsor, New South Wales——Mr. Tebbutt published in pamphlet
form in 1887 an interesting history and description of his observatory.
It is situated, with the owner’s residence, at the eastern extremity of the
town of Windsor, upon a hill 50 feet above mean tide. Occasional
astronomical observations were made here with a sextant and 13-inch
telescope from 1854 to 1864. To these instruments were added a 34-
inch refractor by Jones in 1861, and a Frodsham chronometer in 1864,
At the close of 1863 a small building, comprising transit and prime -
vertical rooms and a dome, was erected on the west of the dwelling,
and a small transit and the 34-inch refractor already referred to were
ASTRONOMY. 187

mounted. This refractor gave place to one of 44 inches aperture in
1872, and in 1874 a further addition was made to the buildings.
In 1879 a substantial observatory of brick was erected a few yards
southwest of the old building. It consists of an equatorial room
(under which is an office) and meridian and prime vertical rooms, the
meridian room containing a Cooke transit, mounted in 1879. In 1882
an 8-inch Grubb equatorial supplanted the 45-inch. Mr. Tebbutt has
published many valuable observations of comets, asteroids, double and
variable stars, occultations of stars by the moon, ete., during the more
than twenty-five years’ existence of his observatory.

Wolsingham.—Rey. T. . Espin has continued his sweeps for red stars
and stars with remarkable spectra, and has announced the discovery of
several new variables. <A 4.8-inch Troughton & Simms eqatorial has
been added to the equipment, and a new edition of Birminghaim’s red
star catalogue has been published. In the latter part of 1888 the ob-
servatory was removed to’ a new site at Towlaw, Darlington, 5 miles
northeast of its old position and 1,000 feet above sea-level.

Yale.—The initial volume of ‘Transactions of the Astronomical Ob-
servatory of Yale University,” a valuable memoir by Dr. W. L. Elkin
upon the relative positions of the principal stars in the Pleiades, as de-
termined with the new heliometer, was published in 1887, the expense
of printing having been borne by Professor Loomis. Upon the comple-
tion of this work Dr. Elkin took up the investigation of the parallaxes
of the ten first-magnitude stars in the northern hemisphere, and the re-
sults obtained we have already referred to under stellar parallax. The
heliometer has also been used for measures of various double stars and
of the diameters of the sun and Mars, and more recently in a triangu-
lation of twenty-four stars within 100’ of the north pole, and in ob-
servations of Iris for the determination of the solar parallax. Mr. Hall
has nearly completed the reduction of his work upon Titan, the expense
of which is defrayed by the Bache fund, and he has taken up the in-
vestigation of the parallaxes 6 B Cygni and Lalande 18115, 22.) Mr.
O.T. Sherman, who had charge ofthe thermometric bureau, resigned in
November, 1886, and his work has since been earried on by Mr. Peck.
The testing of time-pieces has been discontinued, but the time-service is
still maintained. The subscription of $1,000 annually for the support of
the work with the heliometer has been renewed for three years, begin-
ning with 1887.

Zacatecas (Mexico).—Latitude +22° 46’ 34.9, longitude 6" 50™ L7.85

ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.

The 36-inch Lick telescope.—The great equatorial was mounted in 1887.
The visual objective has a clear aperture of 36 inches and focal length
of 56 feet 6 inches. The flint disk for this objective was obtained by
Clark from Feil & Co., of Paris, in 1882, the crown in 1885, and the ob-
jective was completed and delivered by Clark in 1886. These two disks
are separated in their cell by a space of 6.5 inches. In 1887 a third
(crown) lens of 33 inches aperture and 46 feet focus was procured as a
‘photographic corrector.” The mounting was made by Warner &
Swasey, of Cleveland, Ohio, and put in place in the autumn of 1887.
The pier is a hollow cast-iron column of rectangular section, and for
convenience in transit is built up of five sections, bolted together by
internal flanges. At the top the column measures 4 feet by 8 feet, in-
creasing to 5 feet by 9 feet at the floor line, and then spreading out rapidly
to a base 10 feet by 16 feet bearing on a masonry foundation. At this
point the weight is distributed over a series of large steel screws, which
afford the means of adjusting the position of the polar axis. At the top
of the column is the head carrying the bearings for the polar axis, and
around the head is a balcony reached by a spiral staircase. The inter-
section of polar and declination axes is 37 feet above the base. Column
and head weigh together 21 tons, and the total weight of the telescope
is 40 tons. The tube consists of a central section of cast-iron, strongly
ribbed, to which two sections of sheet-steel are attached. The diameter
of the tube is 4 feet at the center, 38 inches at the object-glass end, and
36 inches at the eye end, while the sheet-steel portions vary from one-
eighth of an inch thick at the center to one-twelfth of an inch thick at
the ends. When the telescope is in a horizontal position the flexure of
the tube with the object glass and permanent counterbalance is one-
eighth of an inch only, while with a load of 1 ton added at each end the
flexure is increased to one-quarter of an inch.

The polar axis is of steel, 10 feet long, 12 inches in diameter at its
apper and 10 inches at its lower end, with a 6-inch hole through its
entire length; the bearings are of Babbitt metal, relieved by anti-friction
rolls. The declination axis is also of steel, 10 feet 6 inches long, 10
inches tapering to 94 inches diameter, with a 4-inch hole running
through it; Babbitt-metal bearings, with anti-friction rolls, upon hard
steel balls are used, as in the polar axis. To facilitate counterpoising
the telescope is arranged for carrying always its maximum load, so that
when the photographic corrector, the spectroscope, or any physical ap-
paratus is attached an equivalent weight is taken off at the same place.
There are three regular finders of 6, 4, and 3 inches aperture; in addi-
tion to these the 12-inch equatorial can be quickly attached as a pointer
for photographic work if necessary. The hour circle on the polar axis
is 3 feet in diameter, and has coarse graduations to 5 minutes, and large
figures on its outer edge, while on the northern face it is graduated to
20 seconds. Attached to the head, at the upper end, is a fixed hour

circle graduated to 20 seconds and read through a series of prisms, at
the eye end to 4 seconds. On the declination sleeve near the tube is a
fine declination circle 3 feet in diameter graduated to 5 minutes of are,
and read from the eye end to 12 seconds, while on the outer end of the
axis 1S a Coarse declination circle 6 feet in diameter graduated to degrees.
The driving clock is regulated by a frictional governor of the cross-
armed type and by an electric control from the standard elock. One
of the shafts carries a chronograph drum. For photographie work an
opening is cut in the side of the tube about 10 feet from the eye end,
and a plate 20 inches square can here be inserted and suitably adjusted.
The eye end is so arranged that the micrometer can be quickly re-
moved and two steel bars inserted in bearings, These bearings are
part of a jacket revolving 360° in position angle, and to them can be
attached spectroscopes, photometers, enlarging cameras, ete. The eye
end is also surrounded by a large ring, which supports the various
handles for actuating the clamps and slow motions, and earries the read-
ing microscopes and finders as well. as a small sidereal chronometer.
The clamps and slow motions are operated as follows:

An observer at the eye end can—
(1) Clamp in declination.
(2) Give slow motion in declination.
(3) Read the declination circle (two verniers).
(4) Clamp in right ascension.
(5) Stop the clock.
(6) Give slow motion in right ascension.
(7) Read. right ascension circle (one microscope).
An assistant on either side of the balcony below the axes can—
(8) Clamp in declination.
(9) Give rapid motion in declination.
10) Give slow motion in declination.
11) Give quick motion in right ascension.
12) Give slow motion in right ascension.
) Clamp in right ascension.
4) Stop or start the driving clock.
) Read the right ascension circle (two microscopes).
) Read a dial showing the nearest quarter degree of declina-
tion.

Detailed drawings of the mounting are given in Engineering, volume
46, London, 1888.

The almucuntar.—In volume 17 of the Annals of Harvard College
Observatory, Mr. 8. ©. Chandler, jr., has given a complete description
and investigation of his “almuecantar,” and a discussion of a series of
observations made with it in 1884 and 1885. The almucantar, as its
name implies, is an equal altitude instrument, and was devised by Mr.
Chandler in 1879, It consists, essentially, of a telescope attached to a
ASTRONOMY. 191

frame-work which is floated on a small quantity of mercury contained
in a Shallow trough. The trough is supported on an upright pillar,
and can be turned about a vertical axis, and set with the telescope it
carries to any azimuth. If the telescope is clamped at a given altitude,
the sight line will mark accurately in the heavens a parallel of altitude,
or “almucantar,” aud the observation of the time of transits of stars as
they rise or fall over this circle in different azimuths will furnish the
means of determining instrumental and clock corrections, the latitude,
or right ascensions and declinations. The particular parallel of alti-
tude which has been found most convenient, as it materially simplifies
the formule of reduction, is the parallel passing through the pole, to
which the name ‘“co-latitude circle” is given. Mr. Chandler gives the
mathematical theory of the new instrument, and illustrates the various
formule for reducing observations by numerous examples. He then
proceeds to examine critically the results of his observations (which
are given in detail in the last chapter), and to describe a number of ex-
periments on the stability of the instrument. He also suggests several
modifications of construction, which he hopes in time to incorporate in
a more complete form of the apparatus.

The almucantar as a field instrument seems to possess many advan-
tages over the transit and zenith telescope for the determination of
time and of terrestrial latitudes and longitudes, and Mr. Chandler
states that it can be constructed at a much less cost than these in-
struments; but for the determination of accurate positions of the fixed
stars—a class of work for which meridian instruments have hitherto
been exclusively employed—it- offers a new and independent metiiod,
free from many of the systematic errors inherent in the older system.
The remarkable results that Mr. Chandler has already obtained with
his instrument of only about 4 inches aperture certainly justify great
confidence in the ‘¢‘almucantar system.”

Horizontal telescope.—Professor Pickering has had made for the Har-
yard Observatory a horizontal telescope of 12 inches aperture and 17
feet focal length, possessing some of the conveniences of the equatorial
coudé, The tube is placed east and west, the object-glass at the west-
ernend. Before the object-glass is a plane mirror 18 inches in diame-
ter, so mounted that the light of a celestial object not more than one
hour on either side of the meridian can be thrown by its means into
the field of the telescope. A small building covering the eye-piece at
the eastern end protects the observer, and may be heated in winter so
that he can work in comfort. The instrument may be used for almost
any class of observations, but is intended primarily as a photometer,
and with this end in view an auxiliary telescope of 5 inches aperture
is employed to bring into the field an image of the Pole-star, which is
reduced by polarizing apparatus to equality with the image of a star
observed in the principal telescope. The angular apertures of the two
telescopes are such that the emergent pencils are coincident,
192 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

A device adopted at Greenwich in the observations of occultations
during the eclipse of the moon on January 28, 1888, seems worthy of
record. The eye-piece of the telescope was mounted eccentrically from
the axis at the distance of the moon’s radius, so that, without disturb-
ing the position of the telescope, any point of the limb could be
brought into the center of the field. For setting the position-circles
rapidly in the dark, card-board circles, with notches cut at important
points which could be felt with the fingers, were used; and in another .
case Iuminous paint was found to work admirably for indicating the
figures.

In the report of the Melbourne Observatory Mr. Ellery describes a
form of micrometer used successfully on the great reflector for making
sketches of nebule. It consists of a number of silver threads crossing
at right angles, and rendered visible at will by means of an electric
current.

M. Périgaud has found that the essential condition in the artificial
horizon aevised by Gautier for the meridian work of the Paris Observa-
tory is that the mercury should form an extremely thin covering upon
the bottom of the containing vessel. For the inncr basin used in Gau-
tier’s apparatus he has substituted a plate of such diameter as to leave
a space of 5 millimeters between its edge and the side of the outer ves-
sel, and the plate being carefully levelled, it is possible to flow over it a
mere film of mercury, which will give sharp images under most adverse
circumstances.

It may not be out of place here to call attention to the suggestion
made by Brashear and others in regard to standard dimensions in as-
tronomical and physical instruments. The great convenience which
would result from having the fittings of telescopes, eye pieces, draw
tubes, ete., interchangeable ean hardly be over-estimated,

MISCELLANEOUS.

The Lalande prize of the Paris Academy in 1887 was awarded to Dr.
Dunér, of the Lund Observatory, Sweden, for his double-star work and
his researches on stellar speetra; the Valz prize to Périgaud for his
valuable investigations of the meridian instruments of the Paris Ob-
servatory and other important astronomical work. The Janssen prize
for progress in astronomical physics, awarded this year for the first
time, was decreed to the late Dr. Kirchhoff; the Arago medal, also
awarded for the first time, to Bischoffsheim the founder of the Nice
Observatory; and the La Caze physical prize to Paul and Prosper
Henry for their work in astronomical photography. The Rumford
medal of the Royal Society was presented to Professor Tacchini, for
his investigations on the physics of the sun, November 30, 1888.

In 1888 the Lalande prize was awarded to Bossert for his extensive
and valuable astronomical computations; the Valz prize, to Prof. KE. C.
Pickering for photometric work; the Janssen prize, to Dr. Huggins for
ASTRONOMY. 193

his researches in spectrum analysis. The Damoiseau prize was not
awarded.

The gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was awarded on
February 10, 1888, to Dr. Auwers, for his re-reduction of Bradley’s ob-
servations. The Draper medal of the National Academy of Sciences
was awarded in April to Professor Pickering, and the Lawrence Smith
medal, to Professor Newton for his original work on the subject of me-
teorites.

Prizes amounting in value to about $1,000 were distributed at the
December, 1887, meeting of the French Astronomical Society for the
best schemes submitted for reforming the calendar. The chief prize
was secured by M. Gaston Armelin, of Paris.

Telegraphic transmission of astronomical data.—Early in 1888 a new
code book, ‘The Science Observer Code,” for the convenient and accu-
rate transmission of astronomical data by telegraph, was published by
Messrs. Chandler and Ritchie as ‘‘ Occasional Publications No. 1” of the
Boston Scientific Society. The new cude book supersedes the dictionary
formerly in use, and as the words are conveniently numbered it is used
with great facility. Thenumber code of 200 quarto pages is followed by
a phrase code with numerous examples, covering 17 pages, and by tables
for reducing decimals of a day to hours, minutes, and seconds, and vice
versa,

The number words have been selected from the dictionaries of sev-
eral languages, it being the intention that the literal arrangement of
any word should differ from that of every other by at least two letters;
all words of more than ten letters are excluded. The words are ar-
ranged in 400 sections, numbered from 0 to 399, each section compris-
ing 100 words, numbered from 0 to 99; any integral number up to
39,999 can therefore be represented by a single letter. The phrase
code is arranged for the transmission of information in regard to
comets, planets, variable stars, the state of the weather, and for ref-
erence, also, to stars in the Durchmusterung and Gould’s zone cata-
logue. Checks are provided for correcting errors which have been
introduced in the transmission. After the lapse of suffic.ent time for
all astronomers so desiring to provide themselves with a copy of the
code, it finally went into effect on October 1, 1888. The observatory of
Harvard College is the central station for the distribution of astro-
nomical information in this country, and Dr. Krueger, at Kiel, serves in
a like capacity for Europe.

A paper in No. 2791 of the Astronomische Nachrichten, on the meteor-
ological conditions favorable for establishing a large telescope, should
command the attention of any one upon whom may rest the responsi-
bility of locating a new observatory. It is manifestly important that a
careful examination of the meteorological conditions of any proposed
site for a large telescope should be made, particularly with reference to

the quality of the images of the stars. This ean be done with a scin-
tilloscope or more accurately with the scintillometer, for it is this scin-
tillation or superposition of an infinite number of movable images that
causes the unsatisfactory seeing so often encountered. Herr Exner, in
studying the scintillation at Vienna, has not found a single night on
which this disagreeable phenomenon was not present. ;

‘‘The Observatory” on completing its tenth volume with the number
for December, 1887, passed from the hands of Messrs. Maunder, Down-
ing and Lewis to Messrs. Turner and Common. The editors’ address
remains Hyde House, Westcombe Park, Blackheath, 8. E., England.

The twefth meeting of the International Astronomische Gesellschaft
was held at Kiel from the 29th to the 31st of August, 1887, under the
presidency of Dr. Auwers. The next meeting will be at Brussels in
1889.

A new society for encouraging the study of nature, the “ Gesellschaft
Urania,” has been established at Berlin under the presidency of Pro-
fessor Forster, of the Berlin observatory. Popular lectures are given
on scientific subjects, and a very well-written popular journal, ‘‘ Him-
mel und Erde,” is published, especial attention being paid to astron-
omy.

Another new society, the “Société Astronomique de France,” founded
January 28, 1887, at Paris, by M. Flammarion, has met with remark-
able success. Reports are published in the “ Observatory,” and in
“T/Astronomie,” and the proceedings appear in an annual bulletin.

Among recent works of general interest to astronomers are Professor
Langley’s “New Astronomy,” Young’s “Text-book on Astronomy,”
Proctor’s “Old and New Astronomy,” which is being published in
parts, and volume I, part 1, of Houzeau and Laneaster’s admirable
“ Bibliographie générale de lastronomie.”

ASTRONOMICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR 1888.

The following list contains the titles of the most important books and
journal articles published during the year 1888, with a few papers of
earlier date, that have come under the writer’s notice. A number of
titles have also been taken from reviews or catalogues \ ere the pub-
lications themselves have not been accessible. A more conpiete bibliog-
raphy for the year 1887 has already been published in the Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections, No. 664, and it has not seemed advisable to
extend the present list by including references to observations of comets
and asteroids, or the titles of journals or other annual publications.

By W J MCGEE, Geologist, U. S. Geological Survey.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

At its birth each branch of science is fostered and promoted by individ-
ual effort, and its early history is an account of individuals; in the youth
of a vigorous branch of science it is cultivated and developed not only
by individual effort, but by groups of men and definitely organized sci-
entific and educational institutions, and its history is an account of
individuals, of institutions, and of its own first fruits ; when a branch of
science approaches maturity it is further promoted and applied, and
its influence generally diffused, chiefly by groups of individuals organ-
ized as institutions of learning and research, and its history is an aec-
count of institutions rather than individuals and of its results in the
promotion of human welfare; and there is a final stage in the history
of the development of a branch of science in which the previously
technical knowledge becomes generally diffused among and applied by
certain classes or all classes of men, in which it gradually passes from
the domain of pure science into that of the arts, and in which its his-
tory is an account of the people and of the material progress of a coun-
try or of the civilized world. Such has been the course of development
in different branches of science; and such is the course pursued through
one or more stages in those branches of science not yet completely de-
veloped.

Geology is one of the younger and at the same time one of the more
vigorous branches of the tree of knowledge; and so rapidly has it de-
veloped, that within the memory of men yet living, it has passed from
the infantile stage represented by individual effort to the adolescent
stage represented by combination of effort among definitely organized
institutions. Its problems are of such magnitude and such profound
importance to the people at large that the states, as well as the learned
institutions of the civilized world, have joined in the effort to solve them
and render their results available. Geologic surveys are carried on in
the states of this and some other countries ; the general governments
in this and other countries maintain bureaus of geologic information ;
many scientific societies have geologic sections and departments, and

ogy; and many of the educational institutions have departments in
which the science of geology is taught not only from text-books, but
through original investigation, whereby the science is extended and its
field enlarged. So, while the results of individual effort are of inesti-
mable value to the growing science of geology, and while any account
of the science must deal primarily with the contributions of individuals,
it would seem desirable to preface even a short chapter in the history
of progress by some notice of the institutious to which, in conjunction
with the individual workers, that progress is due; and accordingly the
following descriptive list of the principal American institutions now
promoting geologic science is prefixed to the account of actual progress
during recent years, and particularly the biennial period 1887, 1888.
The sources of information concerning these institutions are diverse,
widely scattered, and not easily accessible, and accordingly the list may
not be exhaustive.

All necessity for incorporating in this record lists of the individuals
by which geology has been promoted during the biennial period and of
the publications containing the contributions is obviated by a contempo-
raneous publication. Mr. N. H. Darton is now preparing a bibliography
of American geology for the same period, which will shortly be pub-
lished by the U. 8. Geological Survey.

INSTITUTIONS PROMOTING GEOLOGY.
GEOLOGIC SURVEYS.

The Federal Government.—The U.S. Geological Survey was organized
several years ago to prepare a geologic map of the United States, and
by implication to prosecute such investigations as are essential to the
accomplishment of that task. It is indicative of the recognized impor-
tance of geology that during recent years geographic exploration and
study have, in this country at least, been carried on largely as a means
to geologic investigation. The western States and Territories were in
great part explored by geographers and engineers for geologic pur-
poses; in many of the States it was found necessary to make geographic
and topographic surveys before the geologic investigations could be
completed and their results made available to citizens ; and the dearth
of maps of the country at large is such, that a large part of the energies
of the national geologic institution are expended in preliminary geo-
graphic surveys. So the scientific corps of the U.S. Geological Survey,
which includes about forty geologists and assistants, about fifteen pal-
eontologists and assistants, and seven chemists and physicists with
their assistants, comprises also about eighty geographers and topog-
raphers with their assistants ; and there is in addition an executive and
office force of about seventy-five persons. Hon. J. W. Powell is the
Director. During the biennial period just closed the institution has
published two royal octavo annual reports, three quarto monographs
GEOLOGY. Sif 219

(two accompanied by folio atlases), fifteen or sixteen octavo bulletins
(or monographs upon minor subjects), and two octavo volumes relating
to the mineral resources of the country.

The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey was organized many years
since, for the purpose of accurately surveying the coast line and har-
bors of the country and ascertaining and recording their changes, and
for the purpose also of connecting the coasts by trauscontinental sys-
tems of triangulation, and so determining the elements of the geoid re-
lating to our domain. The surveys and maps of this institution are
immediately available as a basis for geologic investigations over the
areas which they cover; and, moreover, the topographic and hydro-
graphic configuration of the coasts and harbors represents a condition
in the geologic evolution of the American continent, and so the inves-
tigations of the institution are in another way available to the geolo-
gist. Important contributions to geology annually result from the work
of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The U.S. Signal Office is maintained for meteorologic observation
and prognostication, and observations are regularly made and recorded
over nearly all parts of the country. Now, climate (including the fall
of rain and the action of resulting rivers upon the surface of the earth)
is the most potent agency in geology; and so the results of the Signal
Office are immediately available to the geologist, and some of the
notable contributions made to geological science during the biennial
period just closed have resulted indirectly from the operations of this
bureau.

The Corps of Engineers of the U. S. Army is engaged in different lines
of investigation, some of which bear upon the action of rivers, the rel-
ative position of land and sea, and other geologic agencies and con-
ditions; and this Federal institution must accordingly be enumerated
among those whose operations annually result in geologic progress.

Canada.—Second only to the U.S. Geological Survey in the magni-
tude and geographic extent of its operations is the Geological Survey
of Canada, which, under the directorship of Dr. A. R. C. Selwyn, has
been energetically prosecuted in various parts of the British dominion
on the American continent during the past two years. The Canadian
survey to-day occupies very much the position occupied by the several
geologic and geographic surveys of the Federal Government during the
last generation, when an important function of the geologist was geo-
graphic exploration: to-day the Canadian geologist is (except when
employed in the relatively small portion of the Dominion now thickly
populated) pre-eminently an explorer; his journeys carry him over un-
known or little known tracts in the broad Saskatchewan plains, the
extended Hudson Bay region, and the inhospitable foot-hills and river
valleys of the northern Rocky Mountains; before he can satisfactorily
represent the results of his studies or even complete his field-werk it is
necessary for him to map the tracts surveyed; and even in the more
220 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

populous portions of the Dominion maps have to be compiled or con-
structed from original surveys in order that the results of the work may
be properly set forth. In Canada as in America the needs of the geol-
ogist stimulates geographic research; and in Canada as in America,
too, geography is practically reduced to a subordinate part of the broad
science of geology, and the derived signification of the terms is the true
one. The corps of the geological survey of Canada includes, in addi-
tion to the director, ten geologists and about the same number of assist-
ants (who are employed chiefly in topographic work) ; two paleontolo-
gists and a paleontologic artist; three chemists and lithologists; a
topographer with two assistants; a librarian; and an accounting and
office force. The principal publications of the survey appear in the
form of annual reports, sometimes accompanied by portfolios or atlases
of maps. During the biennial period just closed two annual reports
have appeared.

Alabama.—Geologic surveys have been maintained for some years in
this State; and Dr. Eugene A. Smith, the State geologist, has, with one
or more assistants, been employed during the period 1887-88 in both
scientific and economic investigations in geology. One octavo report
of 571 pages has been published during the period, and a more volu-
minous publication is in press.

Arkansas.—Early in 1887 a geologic survey was instituted in this
State, with Prof. John C. Branner as State geologist; provision being
made for two or more assistants. The work of the survey has been
pushed forward rapidly, with the co-operation of the U.S. Geological
Survey in certain lines of study; and preliminary reports and one vol-
ume of the more elaborate annual report have been published. The lat-
ter is of special interest, since it settles definitely certain questions con-
cerning aregion reported to be rich in precious metals which had long
agitated the citizens of the State, and indeed led to the establishment
of the survey.

California.—Although this State does not now maintain a geologic
survey under that name, there are two State institutions engaged in
work which is partly geologic. The first is the State mining bureau,
now in charge of William Irelan, jr., State mineralogist, which issues
annual reports (that for 1887 containing 315 and that for 1888 948
pages octavo); and the second is the State engineering department,
in charge of Wm. Ham. Hall, with a corps of assistants. The work of
the department relates largely to irrigation and to the regimen and con-
trol of rivers, and so directly and indirectly to geology. Two octavo
reports have been issued during the biennial period.

Colorado.—There is in this State a mining bureau, in charge of anom-
inal State geologist (the present incumbent is Fred. Bulkley), by which
specific information is conveyed to citizens and others; but no reports
have appeared during the years 1887 and 1888.

Florida.—In 1887 Dr. J. Kost was commissioned State geologist, and
GEOLOGY. 5 22k

proceeded at once upon a geologic survey of the State; and a small
report upon the progress of the work during the year was published.
No provision was made, however, for continuing the work.

Georgia.—A State geologist is commonly employed under the auspices
of the department of agriculture. During the greater part of the bi-
ennial period the incumbent was Augustus R. McCutchen; but after
his death, early in 1888, the position remained vacant for several
months, when it was filled by the appointment of Dr. J. W. Spencer,
professor of geology in the State University at Athens. A law of
1874 provides in addition for the appointment of a State geologist by
the governor; and Dr. Spencer has received this appointment also.
No publications have appeared during the biennial period.

Tllinois.—While no geologic surveys are in progress in this State,
there is maintained at Springfield a State cabinet of geology and nat-
ural history, which is virtually a geologic bureau, and the curator of
which is virtually State geologist. This position was held by Prof. A.
H. Worthen until his decease, and is now occupied by Joshua Lindahl.
No official publications have emanated from the bureau during the last
two years.

Indiana.—A State geologic survey is in progress here, under the
direction of Maurice Thompson, State geologist, with two or three
assistants; and reports are issued annually.

Kentucky.—Prof. John R. Proctor has charge of the State geologic
survey, and, with three or four assistants, has carried forward impor.
tant researches in structural and economie geology during the biennial
period ; and an octavo monograph and several minor papers have been
published.

Michigan.—In: this State there is a geologic survey, the personnel of
which has been changed during the biennial period by the death of
State Geologist C. E. Wright early in 1888, and the subsequent ap-
pointment of Prof. M. E. Wadsworth, president of the State mining
school at Houghton. The survey in this State now partakes of the
character of a mining bureau, designed to convey specific information
upon definite subjects to citizens of the State, and no important publi-.
cations have been made during the biennial period.

Minnesota. —A geologic survey has been under way for some years,
under the direction of State Geologist N. H. Winchell, with a corps of
assistants. Annual reports are published in octavo; and during the
biennial period the second volume of the final report, in large quarto,
has appeared.

New York.—A Stato geologic survey is in progress here under the di-
rection of the board of regents of the University of the State of New
York, the veteran paleontologist Prof. James Hall being State geolo-
gist. Two volumes of the elaborate series of quarto paleontologic mo-
nographs, and two annual reports in octavo, have been issued by the
survey during 1857-38.
222 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

North Carolina.—By the death of State Geologist W. C. Kerr, 1834,
a large amount of geologic material was left among the State archives
in crude condition; and in order that this material might be rendered
available to the State, Prof. Joseph A. Holmes, of the State University,
at Chapel Hill, was appointed to collate, digest, and publish it. This
report, which represents the work of the State survey during the bi-
ennial period, is now in press.

Ohio.—The activity of the State geologic survey of Ohio declined
with the publication of the elaborate series of final reports by Dr. J.S,
Newberry during the period 1873-1878 ; but the economic results to which
the scientific investigations reported upon in these volumes were pre-
liminary were subsequently elaborated and expanded by Dr. Newberry’s
successor, Prof. Edward Orton, of the State University. During the
biennial period there was renewed activity in economic investigation
under the stimulus of the discovery of rock gas and petroleum in large
quantities within the State; and two editions of a preliminary report
upon these substances, together with an elaborate final report upon the
various mineral resources of the State, have been published since the
beginning of 1887.

Pennsylvania.—The most elaborate geologic survey ever conducted
under the auspices of a single American State was recently made in
Pennsylvania. As the local studies in various counties approached
completion the results were published in seventy or eighty octavo vol-
umes; the activity of the survey then diminished somewhat, and the
energies of the director, Dr. J. P. Lesley, and his chief assistant, C. A.
Ashburner, were directed toward the digestion of the material thus.
collected and the preparation of final reports. Annual reports have
however been regularly issued; and during the biennial period advance
sheets of a dictionary of fossils, which although primarily paleontologic
is designed for the use of geologists, have also been issued.

Texas.—The second State geologic survey created within the bien-
nial period is that of Texas, instituted and endowed liberally in 1588,
with E. T. Dumble as State geologist, and provision for two or more
assistants. No publications have thus far appeared.

Wyoming.—A Territorial geologist (Louis D. Ricketts) has been em-
ployed in investigating the geologic structure and mineral resources of
this Territory during the biennial period, and an annual report cover-
ing the operations during 1887 has been published.

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

There are a number of universities and colleges in America which
promote geologic science by providing (sometimes indirectly) for origi-
nal investigations on the part of officers and pupils, and by publish-
ing the results of these investigations.

Colorado State School of Mines.—In this institution researches in
geology, mineralogy, mining, etc., are prosecuted by the president, Dr.
GEOLOGY. 2A0

Regis Chauvenet, and by Prof. Arthur Lakes and Prof. Magnus C.
Ihlseng. These officers are sometimes accompanied by advanced pupils,
but rather for their instruction than for any assistance they may be able
to give. The results of these field researches are generally published
annually by the school in suitably illustrated octavo volumes.

Columbia College.-—No specitic provision is made here for original re-
searches in geology in connection with the regular course of instrue-
tion; but the professor of geology in the School of Mines forming a
part of the institution, Dr. J. 8S. Newberry, devotes his vacations and
leisure to geologic work in field and office; and in this work he some-
times receives the assistance of, and his example is sometimes imitated
by, advanced pupils. Part of the results of these researches appear
in the School of Mines Quarterly, which is regularly published by the
College Alumni Association. It should be understood that in this as
in some other cases (and indeed in some measure in all cases) the credit
for the original work belongs rather to individuals than to the insti-
tution.

Dakota School of Mines.—This institution is located at the same
time in the only notable mining region in the State and in one of the
most interesting geologic provinces on the face of the globe; and while,
as in Colorado, the course of instruction relates rather to technology
than pure science, field-work is carried on not only in connection with
the teaching but during vacations, chiefly by the dean, Prof. Franklin
Rh. Carpenter. A preliminary report upon this work was published in
1888 in an illustrated octavo volume of 171 pages.

Denison University.—Original investigations in field and office are
carried on in this institution in connection with the regular course of
instruction by C. L. Herrick, professor of geology and natural history,
and some of his associates and pupils; and the results of these re-
searches are published in excellent style in the Bulletin and Transae-
tions of the scientific laboratories of the University.

State University of Towa.—Special provision for original investigation
is not made in this institution; but the energetic incumbent of the chair
of geology and zoology, Prof. Samuel Calvin, carries forward, in connec-
tion with his university duties and during vacations, original researches
in geology and paleontology; and in 1888 the publication was com-
menced of a “ Bulletin from the Laboratories of Natural History,” in
which the results of the work of Professor Calvin and some of his asso-
ciates and pupils are printed.

Johns Hopkins University.—There is in this university a fellowship
assigned to geology which is worth $500 per year; and during the fis-
cal year there has been allotted in addition a small sum for the pay-
ment of field expenses incurred by the fellow of geology. Moreover,
field-work is recognized as an important aid in class instruction, and
the professor of geology, Dr. George H. Williams, introduces his pupils
to practical work in the field upon the crystalline rocks of eastern Mary-
224 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

(and. The outcome of this work by Dr. Williams, that of some of his
pupils, and that of the fellow in geology, Dr. William B. Clark, is pub-
lished in condensed form in the University circulars. Both Dr. Will-
iams and Dr. Clark, however, spend their vacations in field and office
work for the U. 8S. Geological Survey.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology.—Geologic investigations are
conducted by the incumbent of the chair of geology in this institution,
Prof. W. O. Crosby, chiefly during vacations; classes are sometimes
taken into the field; and the results of the various studies are sometimes
printed in the Technological Quarterly published by the Institute.

University of Nebraska.—The professor of geology (Lewis EK. Hicks,
in this institution is ex officio State geologist, and divides his energies be-
tween class instruction and field investigation within the State; the
classes are sometimes introduced to practical field-work in the vicinity
of the University, and the advanced pupils sometimes aid the professor
in his work in more distant parts of the State ; and the results are pub-
lished in a bulletin of the University.

Princeton (College of New Jersey.)—Field-work in geology and paleon-
tology is carried on in connection with class instruction in this institu-
tion, and several expeditions have been fitted out in this department
for exploration and surveys in the western Territories under the direc-
tion of Prof. Henry F. Osborn. The more important results of the
original work so performed are published in the Bulletin and Memoirs
of the E. M. Museum of Geology and Archeology of the College of New
Jersey. The activity in original investigation has apparently declined
somewhat during recent years.

University of Texas.—In the summer of 1888 a chair of geology was
established in this institution; and it is the policy of its incumbent,
Prof. Robert T. Hill, and of the president of the university, Dr. Leslie
Waggener, to carry on field studies in connection with class work. It
is proposed to publish the more important results of original work in
circulars or bulletins.

Vassar College.—Al|though specific provision is not made in this col-
lege for field studies in connection with class work, the professor of
geology, William B. Dwight, frequently carries his classes into the field
and thus enlivens the prosaic courses of the text books. <A part of the
results of Professor Dwight’s studies in field and office find a place in
the Proceedings of the Vassar Brothers’ Institute, which is connected
with the college.

Washburn College.—No provision is made for original investigation
in connection with class work in this institution, but Prof. F. W. Cragin,
of the natural history department, devotes his vacations and leisure to
geologic investigations in which he is sometimes assisted by associates
and pupils. The preliminary and some of the final results of this work
are printed in the Bulletin of the Washburn College Laboratory—a
periodical maintained chiefly by personal enterprise.
GEOLOGY. 225

Wisconsin State University.—Nine fellowships have recently been es-
tablished in ths university through the influence of President T. C.
Chamberlin, and one or more of these is assigned to geology from time
to time, as the bent of thought of fellows may indicate to be wise. A
chair of agricultural physics is also maintained; and the incumbent,
Prof. F. H. King, devotes a large part of his time to original work more
or less closely connected with geology. A part of President Chamber-
lin’s own time is devoted to researches in geology, the results of which
are published by the U.S. Geological Survey.

There are several American universities and colleges which make no
specific provision for original investigation in geology, but nevertheless
promote the science through officers who are connected with State sur-
veys, who divide their energies between research and didactic work,
and who publish the results of their researches in State documents.

University of Alabama.—Dr. Eugene A. Smith is at the same time

professor of geology in the university and State geologist, and fre-
quently receives the assistance of pupils in the prosecution of his State
work. :
University of Georgia.—During 1888, Dr. J. W. Spencer was called
to the chair of geology and natural history in this university, and about
the end of that year was appointed State geologist. The plans for the
co-ordination of research and instruction here are not yet matured, and
thus far no publications have emanated either from the university or
the survey.

University of Minnesota.—The professor of geology in this institution,
N. H. Winchell, is also State geologist. Although but little field in-
struction is introduced in class work, advanced pupils are sometimes
inducted into practical geology by assisting Professor Winchell in the
State survey.

University of North Carolina.—No provision is made in this institu-
tion for original investigation, but the professor of geology and natural
history, Joseph A. Holmes, has adopted the policy of combining class
instruction with field study; and in his capacity as acting State geolo-
gist he avails himself of the assistance of advanced pupils in the pale-
ontologic and chemic work carried forward by the State.

State University of Ohio.—Prof. Edward Orton, State geologist and
professor of geology in the university, divides his time between survey
work (in which he is sometimes assisted by advanced pupils) and class
instruction; and field studies are occasionally undertaken in connection
with the courses of the text-books.

Rutgers College.-—The professor of geology in this institution, Dr.
George H. Cook, is also State geologist, and the greater part of his
energies (and sometimes the assistance of advanced pupils) are devoted
to State work.

H. Mis. 142 15

226 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

There are in addition several educational institutions in which no
provision is made for publication of the results of original investigation,
and in which there is no connection with State surveys or other insti-
tutions organized for original work, but in which geologic science is in-
directly promoted—either by the combination of class instruction with
original investigation or through partly independent work on the part
of the professors of geology or other officers, ete.

Amherst College.—Prof. B. K. Emerson, of this institution, regularly
carries his classes into the field; and the field work of instructor and
pupils is in part directed toward certain specific problems upon which
Professor Emerson is now at work. In addition that geologist spends
his vacations in field work, the results of which are designed to be pub-
lished in extenso by the U. 8S. Geological Survey.

Cornell University— Prof. H.-S. Williams, of this university, regu-
larly combines his course of instruction in geology and paleontology
with field investigations in southern New York, and sometimes secures
the assistance of advanced pupils in work upon the special problems
which engage his attention from time to time.

Dartmouth College.—In this institution field work is combined in some
measure with the regular class instruction, and the vacations and leis-
ure of the professor of geology, C. H. Hitchcock, are occupied in orig-
inal investigation.

Harvard University.—There is in this university a summer school of
geology, maintained by special fees, and the advanced pupils are given
practical instruction in field work each year by the instructor in geol-
ogy, William M. Davis. Moreover, Profs. N. 8. Shaler and J. D. Whit-
ney, as well as Prof. Davis, devote a large share of their energies to
original investigations in geology, and important contributions to the
science are thereby made each year.

McGill College.—Special provision is not made in this institution
either for carrying on or publishing results of original investigation ;
but Sir William Dawson devotes a large share of his time to researches
in geology and paleontology, and McGill College has, in consequence,
come to be known as one of the principal centers of geologic work on
the American continent. It was almost within the period covered in
this report that this geologist received the distinguished honor of
knighthood, in recognition of his abilities as an original investigator in
geology.

Middlebury College.—President Ezra Brainerd and Prof. G. H. Seelye,
of this institution, combine class instruction and field investigation in
some measure, and, moreover, carry on original researches during va-
cations. |

University of the City of New York.—Prof. John J. Stevenson, of this
institution, has, during recent years, devoted his annual vacations to.
original investigations in the Appalachian Mountains, chiefly in the
Virginias.
_ GEOLOGY. Dore

University of Virginia.—Prof. William M. Fontaine, of the chair of
geology and natural history, devotes a part of his time to original work
in paleo-botany and geology, in which he is sometimes assisted by ad-
vanced pupils.

Wesleyan University.—In this institution, like the last, some field
instruction is given in connection with the regular class work, and, in
addition, Prof. William North Rice devotes his leisure, in part, to orig-
inal investigation.

University of West Virginia.—Prof. I. C. White, of this institution,
divides his labors between educational work and original investigation,
conducted under the auspices of the U. 8. Geological Survey.

Yale University.—Although there is no specific appropriation for
maintaining field investigations in cennection with class instruction,
the venerable James D. Dana, professor of geology, occupies his vaca-
tions and his leisure in field work, and occasionally carries advanced
classes into the field in the vicinity of New Haven. The professor of
mineralogy, Edward 8. Dana, also carries on original investigations in
his department. Moreover, the eminent professor of paleontology, O.
C. Marsh, is largely occupied in original work, at his own cost in part,
and in part under the auspices of the U. S. Geological Survey.

SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS.

There are in this country a number of learned societies and other insti-
tutions of scientific character which either have funds available for orig-
inal investigation in geology or employ officers whose work is in part
original, and which. publish the results of such investigations.

Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.—There are in this insti-
tution professorships in geology and paleontology, and the beneficiaries
(particularly Prof. Angelo Heilprin and Dr. Joseph Leidy) are occupied
in original work, the results of which generally find place among the
regular publications to the academy.

American Museum of Natural History.—Provision is made in the or-
ganization of this institution for a curator of the collections in geology
and paleontology, whose energies are largely devoted to original re-
search. The position is held by Prof. R. P. Whitfield ; and though his
original work relates mainly,to paleontology, much of it has geologic
bearing. The results of his work and of certain other original investi-
gations in geology are published mainly in the Bulletin of the museum.

New York State Cabinet of Natural History.—This institution is main-
tained by the State, and its curator (John C. Smock) not only has charge
of the collections, but carries on original investigations in general and
economic geology. Annual reports, and of late bulletins, are issued.

Peabody Museum of Comparative Zoology.—Provision is made in this
institution for original investigation, and the results thereof (part of
which are geologic) are printed in the regular series of publications of
the museum.
228 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Peabody Museum of Yale University.—In this museum, too, specialists
are employed in original investigation, as well as in caring for the col-
lections; and the publications, which are primarily paleontologic and
only incidentally contain geologic matter, appear in the memoirs of the
museum.

Smithsonian Institution.—In carrying out the purpose of its founder to
increase and diffuse knowledge among men, the Smithsonian Institution
has at various periods in its existence undertaken geologic investiga-
tions, some of which were of great importance and extent, and the results
of these were generally published in part or in entirety. Moreover, the
results of geologic work carried on under other auspices have been pub-
lished from time to time. Since the organization of the U.S. Geological
vey, however, the necessity for geologic work on the part of the Institu-
tion has diminished, and its activity has declined.

U. S. National Museum.—There is provision in this institution for the
employment of a number of specialists as curators ; and many of these
otticers are employed in original investigation. A part of the work re-
lates to geology directly, and also indirectly through paleontology.
The results are made public in the Proceedings and Bulletins of the
National Museum.

Wagner Free Institute of Science.—There are connected with this insti-
tution four professors, who have charge of the museum and library, give
free public lectures, and teach the method of—and also make—research,
The most important original work thus far undertaken was an explora-
tion of the west coast of Florida and part of the Okeechobee wilderness,
with special reference to the geology and zoology of the Floridian penin-
sula, the results of which form an elaborate memoir, prepared by Prof.
Angelo Heilprin and published by the Institute in 1887.

There are in America a large number of scientific societies which pub-
lish the results of geologic investigation, and thus indirectly promote
geologic science, although no original work is directly carried on. Most
of those not noted above are included in the following list:

MISCELLANEOUS.

The most noteworthy event of the biennial period in American geol-
ogy was the birth of the Geological Society of America. The projeet
of organizing such a society has been under consideration by the lead-
ing geologists of the country for a decade; and a call issued by some
of its promoters during the summer of 1888, inviting those interested
to meet at Cleveland on the day before the opening of the session of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (August
14), received hearty response; and temporary organization was there
effected. A meeting for completing the organization was held at Ith-
aca on December 27, and the society was there formally created with
an original fellowship of one hundred and two. The veteran geologist

and paleontologist, Prof. James Hall, was made president ; and the fol-
lowing additional officers were elected: First vice-president, James D.
Dana; second vice-president, Alex. Wincheil; secretary, John J. Stev-
enson; ‘Treasurer, Henzy S. Williams; members at large of the council,
John 8. Newberry, J. W. Powell, and Charles H. Hitchcock.

Another event of moment was the session of the Congrés Géologique
International at London on August 28 to September 5. The session
was made notable to American geology by the attendance of a consid-
erable number of our countrymen, and more particularly by the de-
cision of the Congrés to hold its next session at Philadelphia in Sep-
tember, 1891. The American committee of the Congrés Géologique
International has during the biennial period been actively engaged in
formulating schemes for the classification and cartography of geologic
phenomena, and has published several reports by which the literature
of American systematic geology was materially augmented.

Still another noteworthy event was the establishment of-a strictly
geologic journal, The American Geologist, in 1888. The establishment
of this journal is largely due to western enterprise, and it has been
maintained largely by western talent. The editors and proprietors are:
Prof. Samuel Calvin, Prof. Edward W. Claypole, Dr. Persifor Frazer,
Prof. L. E. Hicks, Mr. E. O. Ulrich, Dr. Alexander Winchell, and Prof.
N. H. Winchell. ’

LEADING EVENTS IN THE PROGRESS OF THE BIENNIAL PERIOD.

Although there is a stage in the development of every science in
which progress may be best measured by the work of institutions, and
another in which the advance is best shown by its own fruits, there is
no stage in which the progress is not primarily due either directly or
indirectly to individual effort: at first a branch of science is promoted
directly by the individual often at great personal sacrifice; as its field
widens and its problems deepen the energies of others are enlisted, and
many individuals combine their labors; thus the institution is formed,
and knowledge is promoted by the united efforts of many workers ; but
whether he is isolated or one of a hundred, whether he is unaided or has
a score of associates, it is always the individual whose eyes perceive
new facts and whose mind conceives new ideas. So, however progress
is measured, it is impossible to state that progress except in the con-
ceptions originating in individual minds.

Every advance in science is made through conceptions which spring
like buds from the growing tree of knowledge, sometimes from the
main trunk when each marks an epoch in intellectual development,
more frequently from a main branch, and still more frequently from a
minor branch, when the advance in knowledge is less striking; and
sometimes the sheoting buds meet and by their union bring forth new
conceptions of the highest value,—for the conceptions resulting from the
convergence of many lines of thought are always of higher grade than
those resulting from divergent lines. While the conceptions constitut-
GEOLOGY. 231

ing progress originate with individuals, the devices for facilitating in-
terchange of thought in modern times are so numerous and complete
that many conceptions are disseminated with their growth, students
keep pace with the progress of their fellows in distant lands, and so
contributions to a generalconception may be made by many individuals.
The rapid advance of human knowledge within recent years must be
attributed not less to the facilities for free interchange of thought now
existing than tothat ever-increasing liberality of modern students which
leads them to share even the first fruits of their work with the entire
world.

Geologic science has been enriched by many notable conceptions dur-
ing the biennial period 1887~88; some of these are the product of in-
dividual minds, while some represent the work of many students upon
related or identical problems; but only a few of the more prominent

ean be noted.
GEOLOGIC PHILOSOPHY.

Philosophie doctrine is the outcome of thought upon different lines ;
when comprehensive it is little affected by the movements upon any
one line; and it is thus so nearly stable that little advance can be per-
ceived within a year or even a decade. But the time has now come for
noting an important step in the development of geologic philosophy;
for although the movement began some years since among advanced
thinkers, and although it has not yet extended to the text-books or
even to the rank and file of workers, its influence is seen in geologic
literature and is rapidly extending.

The primary geologic classification was based directly upon the ob-
jective phenomena of geology; and early geologic literature was per-
vaded, and the science shaped, by this fundamental idea. As time went
on this classification was found too narrow to represent intelligibly the
facts and their relations, and the desire for a more comprehensive tax-
onomy was indicated by the semi-arbitrary division of the science into
various departments in which the minor classes were variously defined
and grouped: Physical geology; Structural geology; Stratigraphic
geology; Historical geology; ete. Although all such divisions were
partly arbitrary, they contained the germ of a more philosophic classi-
fication in which the agencies and conditions of geology are recognized.
Progress in this direction culminated in 1884 in a classification devised
by Powell to serve as a basis for a bibliography of North American ge-
ology. The following divisions are recognized in this classification :

I. Voleanic geology. VIII. Lithie geology.

Il. Diastrophic geology. 1X. Petromorphic geology.
Ill. Hydric geology. X. Geochronic geology.
IV. Glacie geology. ; XI. Chorie geology.

V. Eolic geology. | XII. Geomorphie geology.
VI. Biotic geology. | XIII. Economie geology.
VIN. Anthropie geology. | XIV. Geologie technology. *

Examination of this system of classification shows that it has a triple
basis— the agencies and conditions of geology form one of the elements,
the generalized objective phenomena of geology form another, and the
applications of geologic science form a third; and the classes are neither
eo-ordinate nor definitely seriate, while the minor divisions of each must
be made on unlike bases. The classification is intermediate between
the purely objective systems which went before and the predominantly
genetic systems which were evolved from it.

In the autumn of 1884 a more elaborate scheme of classification of
geology was developed by Gilbert, and discussed at the meeting of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, at Montreal, under
the title of a “ Plan for a Subject-Bibliography of North American Ge-
ology.”* It is as follows:

While the subject-matter is thus divided into processes and products,
and their distribution in time and space are also elements in this scheme,
the category of processes is given a leading place in the classification.

During 1887 and 1888 some minor contributions were made to the
subject by different authors, and the influence of gradual modification
in fundamental conceptions as to the relative importance of agencies
and conditions in classification on the one hand and objective phenom-

ena on the other have become apparent, and a purely genetic taxonomy
of geology, designed also to include geography, has been published
by McGee.* Although this classification can only be regarded as pro-
visional, it may be introduced in brief. It is as follows:

DEFORMATION.

The initial geologic movements (so far as may be inferred from the
present condition of the rocks of the earth) were distortion or displace-
ment of the solid or solidifying crust in such manner as to produce ir-
regularities in the surface of the globe. These are the movements in-
volved in mountain growth and in the elevation of continents; they
have been in operation from the earliest eons recognized by the geolo-
gist to the present time; and the advances in knowledge concerning
them include not only current observations upon the movements now
in progress, but observations upon crumpled and otherwise deformed
strata, and also legitimate inferences concerning the causes of the
movements whose effects are recorded in these strata.

It has long been known that the waters of the Atlantic are advanc-
ing upon the New Jersey coast, in consequence not only of wave-cut-
ting, but also of sinking of the land. So rapid indeed is the sinking
of the land, particularly towards Sandy Hook, that notable geographic
changes have occurred within the last hundred years, and the mining
of timber, which grew upon dry land, but is now lodged among its
stumps many feet beneath tide level and buried beneath the oceanic
and fluvial deposits, has become an industry of some importance. The

Zoe RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1883.

rate of sinking has been estimated by Cook at 2 feet per century;* and
the observations of the last two years corroborate this estimate.

This land movement is not confined to the coast of New Jersey, nor
to historical time. It has recently been shown (1) that the entire
coastal plain of the Middle Atlantic slope is now undergoing depression
so rapid that sedimentation in the numerous estuaries by which it is
dissected lags behind the sinking, so that sub-aerial alluvium is prac-
tically absent from the region; (2) that the Piedmont plain overlook-
ing the coastal lowlands. is rising so rapidly that the rivers are unable
to cut down their gorges to tide level; and (3) that the differential
movement culminates in a line of displacement, which every river
crosses in a cascade or rapid, and along which the principal cities of
the eastern United States have been located.t It would appear that
this displacement began in early Pleistocene time, that it is yet in prog-
ress at a rate probably about as high as quiet orogenic movement ever
acquires, and that the amount of displacement increases northward from
perhaps 100 feet at Washington to 400 or 500 feet at New York.

It is improbable that the great earth-movement of the Middle At-
lantie slope extends into New England; for although this part of the
country is now suffering deformation as recently shown by Shaler, the
tilting is southward rather than northward as in New Jersey. The
modern deformation of New England is best shown in the behavior of
streams. Throughout Massachusetts, Connecticut, and southern New
Hampshire and Vermont, the greater part of the streams flow from
north to south or with slight deviations from this direction. Except at
the headwaters of these streams, where their volume is too slight to
clean their beds of the glacial waste which encumbers them, their
valleys are without swamps, and the streams flow upon beds of hard
rock flanked by terraces of glacial material which record the stages of
valley-excavation—i. ¢., all of these south-flowing streams have high
declivity and are energetically corrading their beds. A much smaller
number of New England streams flow to the northward ; and these, un-
like their south-flowing neighbors, all flow sluggishly in débris-clogged
valleys and are bordered by swamps instead of terraces—i. e., all of
these streams have low declivity and are employed in sedimentation
rather than corrasion. The behavior of both classes of streams sug-
gests southward tilting of the land and can not be satisfactorily ex-
plained in any other way;t and this inference is in line with the cen-
clusions of Dana, the elder Hitchcock, and many others who have
shown that the southward inclination of the terraces of the Connecticut
River and its tributaries indicates a rise of the land to the northward
since the recession of the last ice-sheet of the Pleistocene. It is in line,
too, with the work of Gilbert, Spencer, and others in the region of the

Great Lakes, where, as shown by the first-named geologist in particu-
lar, there has been so decided tilting of the land since the retreat of
the latest ice-sheet that some of the terraces and shore lines carved out
by’ Lake Ontario when its northern confine was the receding ice-sheet,
now incline southward as much as 5 feet per mile in western New York.
Southward tilting in the western part of the Great Lake region is also
indicated by the backing of water in the southern affluents of Lake
Michigan and the consequent conversion of their mouths into swamps
and lakes as shown by Wooldridge.*

The inferences of Shaler in New England and Gilbert in New York
as to the southward tilting of the land are in line with a notable inves-
tigation of the ancient terraces and beaches of the extinct Lake Agassiz
by Upham. As the last ice-sheet of the Pleistocene withdrew beyond
the divide between the Mississippi drainage and that of Hudson’s Bay,
the waters formed by its melting were dammed by the divide and so ac-
cumulated in swamps, ponds, and lakes along its front. The largest
of the lakes occupied the valley now drained by the Red River of the
North. It was a veritable mediterranean sea, albeit of fresh water, and
confined on the north by walls of ice alone; for at the period of its
maximum size it was fully 600 miles long and 200 miles in maximum
breadth. Pending the final melting of the northern mer de glace this
lake found outlet over the portage between Lakes Traverse and Big
Stone, and thence through the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers to the
Gulf; and, although it has now utterly disappeared from the face of
the earth, it has left an unmistakable record of its existence and its
extent in the terraces and beach lines already traced by Upham over
many hundreds of miles, and in the vast beds of lacustral sediments
which make the valley of the Red River the paradise of*the wheat
grower.t Now the old shore lines of this extinct lake (named in
honor of the illustrious Swiss naturalist by Upham) are no longer hori-
zontal as when fashioned by the wind-swept waters, but incline south-
ward about 6 inches per mile on an average. This departure from hori-
zontality in the beach lines has indeed been ascribed (in part at least)
by Upham to deformation of the surface of the lake by the gravitational
attraction of the contiguous ice sheet; but since it has been shown by
Woodward that this cause is alone incompetent under probable assump-
tions as to volume of the ice sheet,t most geologists who concern them-
selves with such questions have settled down to the conviction that
there is here another example of that southward tilting of the area of
Pleistocene glaciation already noted in New England by Dana and
others, in New York by Gi!bert and his contemporaries, and about Lake
Michigan by Chamberlain, and more recently by Woolbridge. Leading
students of the general subject of terrestrial deformation are indeed dis-

posed to look upon the tilting of the glaciated region as but an exem-
plification of one of the fundamental laws of earth movement: Babbage,
Hall, Hunt, and Dana long ago, and Dutton, Fisher, Reade, Alexander
Winchell, and others within the Jast lustrum, have shown that the extér-
ior portions of the earth behave as if in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium,
ready to rise with the removal and sink with the addition of the matter
transferred by the processes of gradation. Now it is evident that an
ice sheet must depress the surface upon which it rests, just as does a
mass of oceanic sediments, directly by its weight, and also indirectly
by chilling and so condensing the underlying rocks; and since, as all
students of the primary agencies and conditions of geology are agreed,
the viscous mass of the earth responds slowly to stresses tending to pro-
duce deformation, it is equally evident that the resumption of original
attitude by any part of the surface after the recession of an ice sheet
must be gradual and perhaps exceedingly slow. So the southward tilt-
ing indicated by the shore lines of Lake Agassiz, by the half drowned
estuaries of Lake Michigan, by the beaches of the ancient Lake Ontario,
and by the terraces of the Connecticut River, all seem attributable to
the effort of the resilient terrestrial crust to return to its original form
on relief from the pressure of the Pleistocene ice sheet; and the diver-
sity in behavior of the north-flowing and south-flowing streams of New
England would indicate that the restoration is even yet barely com-
plete.

The ideas current among the leading geologists of the country con-
cerning the behavior of the earth as an isostatic body when compressed
beneath a great continental glacier have been summarized by Alexander
Winchell within a few months.*

But there are certain comparatively recent changes in level which
can not be attributed to movements due to the weighting of the land
beneath the Pleistocene ice sheet. One of the more important contri-
butions of the biennial period to the general subject of deformation is
that by Le Conte, on the recent changes of physical geography in Cali-
fornia indicated by the flora of the coast islands.t Sometime during
the Pleistocene there was a depression of the Pacific coast by which the
westernmost of the two ranges belonging to the trans-Sierra mountain
system was nearly submerged, only the commanding summits rising
above tide-level to form the islands of Santa Rosa and her companions;
and this drowned mountain range displays no disposition to return to
its former altitude. The period of this submergence is indicated, in so
far as plants may be regarded as chronometers of geologic time, by the
distintictive Pliocene flora of the islands, which has, accorcing to Le
Conte, been preserved by reason of its isolation, while the flora of the
mainland has undergone modification in the struggle against competi-
tors, enemies, and climatic conditions proper to a great continent.

The most notable North American advances of recent years in the
observation and interpretation of the results of diastatic movement
relate to faulting. Two genetic classes of faults have long been recog-
nized—+. é., normal faults, in which the hade (or inclination of the plane
of fracture) is toward the thrown side, and reversed or overthrust faults,
in which the hade is toward the heaved side; ard in general the normal
faults have been attributed to stresses not accompanied by horizontal
compression, and the overthrust faults primarily to horizontal com-
pressio".

A few years ago Archibald Geikie and his collaborators upon the
Geological Survey of Great Britain concluded that the peculiar struct-
ure of the Scottish Highlands is determined by overthrust faulting
upon a grand scale—older strata being pushed over newer, sometimes
for distances amounting to miles. This conclusion was so novel and
striking, and so widely at variance from prevailing opinion, that despite
the ability of the geologists by whom it was enunciated and the appar-
ent conclusiveness of the evidence upon which it was based, many con-
servative students in this country hesitated to accept it; yet within
the last two years there have been brought to light on this side of the
Atlantic almost as striking examples of overthrust faulting as those
of the Scottish Highlands.

During 1886 McConnell made an extended exploration of the Rocky
Mountains among the passes followed by the Canadian Pacifie Rail-
road, under the direction and auspices of the Geological Survey of
Canada. In the course of this exploration he determined the limits of
a remarkable faulted region, now about 25 miles wide, though a rough
estimate places its original width at over 50 miles (the difference indi-
cating the amount of compression suffered), in which the faults are
generally of the overthrust type. The whole region is broken by a num-
ber of parallel, or nearly parallel, longitudinal fractures into a series of
oblong blocks, and these are tilted and shoved one over the other until
they have taken the form of a westerly dipping compound monocline,
rising into a succession of ridges. A section through almost any of
these ridges, starting from the west, shows, first, Cretaceous shales folded
under older formations, ranging from upper Carboniferous downward
through the Devonian and Silurian, and even to the Cambrian. The
overthrusts on the south fork of Ghost River reach 3 or 4 miles; and
in these, as in some other cases, the rocks thus faulted have been sub-
sequently corrugated, and the original fault surface has been flexed
into anticlinals and synclinals, parallel to those of the planes of depo-
sition.*

Recent studies inthe Appalachian region by Willis and other officers
of the U.S. Geological Survey have brought to light examples of over-
thrust faulting, differing only in degree from those of the Scottish
Highlands and the Canadian Rocky Mountains; and these observa-

tions have corrected certain early inferences as to the mechanism of such
faulting; inferences originating partly in Europe and partly in the Ap-
palachians, and current for many years on both sides of the Atlantic.
Heim noticed that in the Alps the inverted limb of an anticlinal is
stretched or even crushed out between the anticlinal and synclinal
curves of an overturn and the flexure thus converted into a fracture,
and inferred that overthrust faults are always formed in this manner ;
but Willis points out that this explanation fails to account for many
of the faults of the Appalachians because the essential fact of squeezed
beds has not been found in that region. He shows also that the Appala-
chian sedimentary series, from the Cambrian upward, is composed of
strata differing greatly in their capacity for resistance to horizontal
thrusts, and that these variations in rigidity occur from place to place in
the same strata as well as in the different strata superimposed one on the
other, and that the rigid strata may not fold at the place where a verti-
cally adjacent flexible stratum does fold, but that the rigid stratum may
ride forward on its bedding plane until it reaches an axis (anticlinal or
synclinal]) in which both beds have suffered flexure, and that the forward
movement may then sheer across the beds on the opposite dip, produc-
ing a fault.* Under this view it would appear that the yielding of
rocks to horizontal pressure may take place, (1) as corrugation; (2) as
overthrusts, perhaps originating in incipient corrugations ; (3) as vari-
ous combinations of corrugation and overthrust faulting, the difference
_ in effect depending upon difference in structure, difference in the pressure
beneath superincumbent beds, and other differences in conditions.

Willis’s inferences from Appalachian structure have been checked by
experimentation. During the past year he has subjected masses of wax
consisting of alternating layers of varying rigidity, built up in imitation
of the rocky strata of the earth’s crust, to horizontal compression, the
waxen strata being variously loaded in different experiments ; and he
finds that the deformation of the miniature strata in his models imitates
the deformation displayed on a grander scale in the Appalachian Mount-
ails.

Another order of faults, also resulting from horizontal compression,
has recently been developed by Davis. There are in the Connecticut
Valley extensive deposits of sandstone and shale of Triassic age, of un-
known thickness, generally dipping eastward at a considerable angle ;
and there are in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and northern Virginia sim-
ilar deposits of Triassic sandstone, also of unknown thickness, dipping
westward at high angles. In both of these areas the existence of faults
has long been suspected, and in a few cases minor faults have actually
been discovered ; so the feeling has gained ground that despite the persis-
tent and high dips over broad areas, the deposits are only of limited thick-
ness. Now Davis has shownt that in the Connecticut area there are

GEOLOGY. 239

intercalated within the sandstones certain sheets of trap, mainly intru-
sive; and using these distinctive beds as data planes in the otherwise
homogeneous deposits, he finds that the same beds re-appear many
times, and that in some cases several successive trap ridges are formed
by outcropping edges of a single sheet, the mass having been thrown
into a series of parallel blocks and subsequently so degraded as to leave
the harder trap projecting in the form of strongly accented surface
features. His explanation of the faulting in this region is unique. He
supposes that the Triassic sandstones were originally deposited in hor-
izontal beds upon an eroded surface of highly inclined (but not vertical)
schists, gneises, ete.; that after the completion of Triassic deposition,
horizontal compression occurred ; that the inclined crystalline strata
slipped upon each other, as does a row of fallen books when pushed to
upright position, and thus became more nearly vertical; and that as
the successive blocks (defined perhaps by interealations of softer mat-
ter) approached verticality the veneer of Triassic sediments above was
broken through by a succession of approximately vertical faults coin-
ciding with the planes of slipping among the crystalline strata. Davis’s
hypothesis is certainly suggestive, and, if valid, constitutes a notable
-advance in the branch of geology dealing with the deformation of the
earth.

The terra incognita of American geographers for many years has
been, singularly enough, not the comparatively inaccessible mountains
and deserts of the West, but a tract in southwestern Missouri, north-
western Arkansas, and eastern Indian Territory. Somewhere here was
supposed to belong that will-o’-the-wisp of geographers and geologists
alike, the Ozark Mountain system—a half-ideal mountanic tract com-
monly named in geographic treatises and sometimes vaguely located in
small-scale maps, though no geographer knew their exact position and
no geologist knew their structure. Now during the last year or two
a part of this tract has been surveyed topographically by officers of the
U.S. Geological Survey and its general configuration ascertained ; and
moreover the work of the geological survey of Arkansas has extended
along its southern flanks and the predominant structural characteristics
ascertained. According to Branner and Comstock, the region suffered
post-Paleozoic deformation now expressed by corrugation approaching
the Appalachian type, the strata lying in a series of folds of nearly
east-west direction;* and as pointed out by the former in a communica-
tion before the American Association for the Advancement of Science
at Cleveland, the crystalline rocks found along the southern flanks of
the corrugated tract are not eruptive, as they have hitherto been re-
garded, but Archean, so that the region would appear to be homologous
with and probably a continuation of the Appalachian region of eastern
United States.

During the biennial period there have been some valuable foreign
contributions to our knowledge of the causes and conditions of mount-
ain-making, notably the development of the conception of the “ level-
of-no-strain;” for as shown upon physical grounds, by Reade, Fisher,
G. H. Darwin, and Davison, there is at limited depth within the terres-
trial crust a horizon or couche in which tangential stress disappears.
This conception has modified American as well as foreign thought, but
thus far no important contributions to the subject have been made on
this side of the Atlantic.

Apropos to the conclusions of geologists and physicists concerning the
isostatic condition (or condition of hydrostatic equilibrium) of the exte-
rior crust of the earth, and of the bearing of these conclusions upon the
general problem of mountain-making, reference may be made to a prac-
tically new conception as to certain relations between sedimentation
and depression which bears upon the theory of mountain-making re-
cently advocated by Reade. It may be thus stated: Lines of sedi-
mentation are the margins of continents, and the sediments are laid
down not upon horizontal surfaces, but upon seawardly sloping bot-
toms; so the sediments do not form horizontal beds, but take a variable
seaward slope, determined by marine currents, wave action, etc. Thus .
the mass of sediments is collectively in the condition of a mass of snow
upon a roof or upon a mountain side; 7. é., in a condition of potential
instability or inequipotentiality. If the mass is stable in either case, it
is because the friction among the particles exceeds the attraction of
gravitation upon the particles; it is obvious that if particle friction
were reduced by augmentation of temperature or by alteration of con-
stitution, or if the efficiency of gravitation were increased by addition
to the mass, the point of stability might be passed, when the mass
would move in the direction of the slope; and it is equally obvious
that if an inequipotential mass expand, the resulting movement will
not take place equally in all directions, bat mainly or wholly in the
direction of least resistance, which is that of the slope. Since the
sediments fringing continents are in a condition of inequipotentiality,
any movement due to the rise of isogeotherms or other cause must take
place in a single direction ; and it might not be limited to that due to
expansion, for other factors co-operate. Supplemented by this addi-
tional conception, the hypothesis of mountain growth so ably advocated
by Herschel* (who alone recognized vaguely the conception), Babbage,
Hall, Dana, Le Conte, Reade, and a score of others, appears to gain
much in acceptability.t The great displacement of the Middle Atlan-
tic slope has been attributed to downward and seaward settling of the
inequipotential mass of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments constituting
the coastal plain.t

Since diastatic movements are predominantly vertical and measured
from sea-level as a datum plane, the determination of the mean sea-level
(commonly called the “figure of the earth,” or, more properly, the geoid)
is important to geologists. The “ figure of the earth ” is also important
to geologists in another way: It has long been known that despite the
gravitational attraction of mountains and continental masses a plumb-
line suspended at the sea-shore is generally deflected seaward, and that
in some cases a plumb-line suspended at the base of a mountain range
is defiected toward the plain rather than the mountains ; and accordingly
it has been supposed by many physicists, astronomers, and geologists
that the rocks constituting the ocean bottom are heavier than those of
the land, and that the rocks underlying plains are often heavier than
those forming mountain masses. Suess and some others have indeed
maintained that such mountain systems as the Andes must attract and
materially elevate the surface of contiguous ocean waters; but Pratt
and several other careful students have, on the contrary, advocated the
simple inference trom observation; and Faye has attributed the great
inequalities of the earth’s surface to the more rapid refrigeration and
consequent condensation of sea bottoms than of land surfaces. Now,
the determination of the differences in density indicated by the anom-
alous deflection of the plumb-line in certain cases, and so the solu-
tion of some of the most profound problems with which geologists have
ever grappled, depends, first, upon the determination of the general
form of the geoid, and second, upon the development of a formula by
which the gravitational attractions of adventitious rock masses, and of
rock masses varying in density, can be computed. The importance of
these inquiries has been recognized by some of the ablest mathemati-
cians, physicists, and geologists, including Thomson, Clarke, Pratt,
Fisher, Stokes, Helmert, G. H. Darwin, Fischer, and others. For some
years past Woodward has been engaged upon these problems ; and dur-
ing 1888 he published an elaborate discussion of the whole subject, in-
cluding analyses of the results reached by former investigators, and
formule applicable in evaluating the deformation of water surfaces by
the gravitational attraction of ice masses, continents, and mountains,
the changes in level of inconstant lakes, ete.* While the immediate

‘result of Woodward’s researches can searcely be regarded as a con-
tribution to knowledge of the general phenomena of deformation, his
contribution is worthy of note as a sound basis for further investigation.

DEGRADATION.

All portions of the earth standing above the level of the sea are sub-
ject to degradation. Different processes effect degradation, but incom-
parably the most potent is the action of rain andrivers. Nowthe whole
subject of hydro-dynamic action has received more attention from Amer-

—

242 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

ican geologists than from those of any other country, and the greater
part of our knowledge of the subject must be credited to American in-
vestigators. Thus, it was American geologists employed in the canon-
cut plateaus and mountains of the western Territories who discovered
that the water of a river is not so much the agert of corrasion (which
is one of the principal modes of degradation) as the vehicle by which
the agent is rendered operative, and that the real agent of corrasion
is the sand or other material with which the water of rivers is loadea.
Pure water is practically impotent as a corrading agent; but when fur-
nished with tools in the form of sand grains it rapidly cuts away the
hardest rocks. And this is only one of many American contributions
to the subject.

Until recently it has been commonly believed that while the sand
grains and other matter held in suspension in river water directly in-
creases corrasion, there is an indirect diminution in corrading capacity
going with the addition of such matter, due to the absorption of a por-
tion of the energy of the stream in transporting the solid matter. Ac-
cording to one of the highest authorities on the subject, ‘ where a
stream has all the load of a given degree of comminution which it is
capable of carrying, the entire energy of the descending water and load
is consumed in the translation of the water and load, and there is none
applied to corrasion. - - - The work of transportation may thus
monopolize a stream to the exclusion of corrasion, or the two works
may be carried forward at the same time.”* The same geologist has as-
sumed the practical equality of the two elements, and thus that corra-
sion is little affected by load. Such has been the state of opinion on
this subject for a decade.

Within a few months another American contribution of the first im-
portance has been made to this subject: In a paper read before the
National Academy of Sciences in November, 18838, Powell pointed out
that there is a distinction between the sediment rolled or pushed along
the bottom of a stream, and that which is of such degree of comminu-
tion as to float in the running water; and that to the extent that ma-
terials are rolled along the bottom by impact the energy of the water
is indeed utilized in transportation, as held by Gilbert and others, but
that to the extent that transportation is accomplished by flotation, tne
gravity of the particles themselves is the entire force of transportation ;
so that whateveris drivenis transported by the energy of the water, while
whatever floats is transported by its own inherent gravity. Thus within
certain wide limits, and under certain conditions of comminution of the
load, the energy of a stream would appear not to be diminished but on
the contrary greatly increased by the addition of load. If the law thus
formulated be valid (and its validity has not thus far been questioned)
its discovery will become of great and wide-reaching practical value to

students of engineering problems, as well as to geologists concerned with
the various and increasingly important problems of degradation.

Unquestionably the most noteworthy contribution to objective geol-
ogy during the biennial period is the recognition by several students of
the intimate relation between topographic configuration and geologic
history. Although fully matured only within a few months, the concep-
tion found birth during the days of active geologic investigation in
western Territories, originating, as have so many other wide-reaching
inductions, in the fertile brain of Powell, but receiving notable impetus
through the early work of Dutton. The former geologist pointed out
that one of the leading determinants of degradation is found in the
declivity of streams, and that there isa certain minimum declivity be-
yond which there is neither corrasion nor transportation. It is of
course evident that no stream can sink its channel below the level of
the sea; aud as Powell pointed out, it is equally evident that at a dis-
tance from the sea a stream can not sink its channel below a certain
altitude above tide which will give aslopejust sufficient to permit flow-
age; and also that no tributary can corrade its channel below the level
of its primary. This lowest limit of corrasion and transportation may
be called the base level of erosion.* The importance of this conception
was realized by several of the leading geologists of the world, but cir-
cumstances prevented further development of the subject, and the con-
ception lay dormant for years.

Recently, different geologists at work in eastern United States have
noticed certain intermontane plains and ancient terraces which can be
explained only upon the hypothesis that during some past period the
Jand stood lower than now, and remained stationary until not only the
rivers and their tributaries, but the minor streamlets—and even the
rain-born rills and so the entire surface, were reduced to a level below
which degradation was impossible; and the term base level was ex-
tended not only to rivers and their tributaries, but to whole continents,
so that to-day the term is applied to a bi-dimensional surface rather than
a series of uni-dimensional lines. Moreover, it was found that the inter-
montane plains are iu many cases bounded by steep slopes and inter-
sected by sharp-cut gorges and ravines which could only be explained
on the assumption that at the close cf the base-level period the land
was lifted so high that degradation was greatly accelerated, but for a
period too short to permit the general reduction of the area to a new
base level; and the geologists concluded that the plains tell of altera-
tions in level of the land as well as of long standing at a single level.
The conception expanded still further as study progressed until it came
to be perceived that every hill and valley is a record of geologic activ-
ity depending upon the relation between land and sea, and thus indi-
cating the geographic configuration of past periods. Soa new geologic

244 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

alphabet was devised, and now geologists read geologic history from the
hills as weil as from the strata and their contained fossils.

This line of investigation has been successfally pursued by Davis,*
who has acquired such skill in the interpretation of geologic history
from topographic forms as to be able to read the principal events in
the geologic development of New Jersey and Pennsylvania from topo-
graphic maps; it bas been pursued by McGee with such success that
“ probably for the first time important practical conclusions, involving
the consideration of hypogeal structure and orogenic movement, have
been based on the interpretation of topography and on inferences from
the present behavior of the streams by which the topography has been
determined ;” + and it has also been pursued with success by Willis in
the central Appalachian region. So complete has been the develop-
ment of this method of investigation that nearly as much information
concerning the geologic history of the Atlantic slope has been obtained
from the topographic configuration of the region within two years as
was gathered from the sediments of the costal plain and their contained
fossils in two generations.

The interpretation of geologic history from topographic configuration
may well be called the New Geology. It opens a new field for the science
so extensive as to nearly double its domain; and this field has been
fully entered by American geologists alone and within the last two
years. )

DEPOSITION.

The clastic rocks—the products of deposition—have been more exten-
sively studied than any other class of geologic phenomena; out of their
study has grown the greater part of geologic literature; surveys and
commissions have been endowed chiefly for the purpose of investigating
them; national and international conventions have been established to
discuss them; and their relations to science in general, to the arts, and
to the welfare of the race have been elaborated by a host of students.

During the biennial period special attention has been given to this
branch of geology under the stimulus afforded by the organization and
active work of the Congrés Géologique International abroad and the
American committee of the Congrés in this country. The American com-
mittee operated mainly through subcommittees, consisting of a few spe-
cialists (one of whom was the reporter of the subcommittee) and some-
times associates. Each subcommittee sought to develop a taxonomy
applicable to a particular part of the geologic column, and the various
snbelassifications are designed to be thrown together into a general
taxonomic system similar to but more refined than those current in
objective geology for a generation. The reporters were, on the Archean
Persifer Frazer; on the Lower Paleozoic, N. UO. Winchell; on the

Upper Paleozoic, H. 8S. Williams (Devonian), and J. J. Stevenson (Car-
boniferous); on the Mesozoic, G. H. Cook; on the Cenozoic, K. A.
Smith (marine Cenozoic), and HE, D. Cope (interior Cenozoic); and on
the Quaternary and recent, C. H. Hitchcock. The several reports were
edited and prefaced with a history of the committee by Frazer, printed
in an octavo volume of about 250 pages, and distributed at the London
session of the Congrés Géologique International. It should be ob-
served that these reports, and the general system into which they are
designed to be thrown, generally represent the primitive analytic classi-
fication or classification by products, and not the synthetic classification
or classification by genesis, mentioned in an earlier paragraph.

The formal reports of the American committee represent however
but a part of the activity in current thought awakened through the or-
ganization of the Congrés. In his vice-presidential address before the
American Association at New York in 1887, Gilbert developed certain
fundamental considerations in geologic taxonomy, nomenclature, and
cartography. The address brought out clearly the distinction between
classifications based upon structural units, and upon time units respect-
ively—classifications which may be perfectly distinct, though both may
traverse the same ground and which are both valuable for different
purposes; eé. g., the mining geologist may only be interested in the
structural classification, while the paleontologist or student of geo-
chrouy may be interested only in the time classification. It is just to
say that this address elicited adverse criticism, notably by Frazer.* A
year later Vice-President Cook addressed his section of the American
Association at Cleveland on a similar subject. A statement of the meth-
ods of cartography in use by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1885 was
presented before the Congres Géologique International at Berlin, in
that year by McGee, and was published in 1888 in the compte rendu of
the session; and other contributions to the taxonomy of the ciastic rocks
have appeared.

It is to be noted that the interest awakened by these discussions re-
sulted not only in much writing on geologic taxonomy based upon infor-
mation already in hand, but also in much valuable work in the field;
and the outcome of this work comprises several of the most important
contributions to geologic progress made during the last two years.

Foremost among these must be placed the recognition by Irving and
his associates (Chamberlin and Van Hise) of a vast mass of sediments,
nearly 6 miles in vertical thickness, below the base of the previously
known fossiliferous rocks of the terrestrial crust and above the original
crystalline nucleus which everywhere forms the foundation upon which
the clastic strata are built. This newly-recognized series of rocks is
best developed in the Lake Superior region, where it was studied by
Irving and his associates; but apparent equivalents have been found in

*Am. Naturalist, vol. xx1, pp. 841, 847, and elsewhere.
246 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

New England by Pumpelly, in the Grand Cafion region by Walcott and
Powell, in Central Texas by Walcott, and in some other parts of the
country. Irving was disposed to separate the series into two groups,
each co-ordinate with the Devonian, Silurian, Cambrian, ete.—viz, the
Keweenawan and Huronian,—and to class the entire series as a great
system co-ordinate with the Paleozoic, for which he proposed the term
Agnotozoic.* The present disposition among leading American geolo-
gists is, however, to reduce the series to the taxonomic rank of the
groups (Devonian, Silurian, etc.), and to combine its divisions under the
name Algonkian.

Second in importance to the recognition of the Algonkian must be
placed the discovery in Texas during 1887 of a series of Cretaceous de-
posits underlying the Dakota formation (the supposed base of the ecre-
taceous in this country), which is paleontologically equivalent to the
lower half of the European cretaceous. The bridging of this break in
the history recorded in American sediments is due to the labors of Hillt
and C. A. White.t The evidence upon which the conclusions of these
investigators rest is largely paleontologic, and their discovery is of in-
terest to paleontologists as well as geologists.

Another noteworthy event, also of interest to the paleontologist, while
at the same time important in statigraphy, is the elucidation of the
structure of the Taconic Mountains in western New England, largely
by Walcott, during 1887 and 1888. There is in eastern New York and
western New England a region of faulted and metamorphosed crystal-
line or suberystalline rocks, generally deeply mantled by drift, which
has been the intellectual battle-ground of nearly all American geologists
given to controversy for over half a century. In the early forties some
of these rocks were erroneously grouped, and efforts were made to give
this fictitious group a place in systematic geology under the name
“Taconic system” and the “ Taconic question” has been before the geo-
logic world from that day almost to this. Late in 1886, and again in
1887, Walcott visited the region, and after much labor discovered the
defective arrangement, ascertained the true relations of the strata, and
made public his conclusions. In this work he was greatly aided, by the
results of careful field studies extending over many years, by the emi-
nent geologist of Yale, James D. Dana. The careful work in the field
by Dana and Walcott has however been criticised. The contributors
to the subject during the biennial period include Hunt, Marcon, Miller,
Newberry, Vogdes, A. Winchell, N. H. Winchell, and others. But to
the geologist interested in substantial progress rather than polemics,
and to the layman interested in the practical results of geologic investi-
gation, the most satisfactory contribution ever made to the ‘‘Taconice

question” was that of the venerable Dana in December, 1888, and it may
easily be quoted at length:

“984i-18s88.°*

An event of some importance to students of the multifarious prod-
ucts of deposition is the definition of the Columbia formation. There
is a break in geologic history, as commonly interpreted, between the
Neocene and the Pleistocene,—a hiatus partly natural and partly taxo-
nomic, and exceedingly difficult to close by reason of diverse methods
of classification as well as by reason of the dearth of common phenom-
ena. But the formation under consideration is a superficial deposit of
known genesis, intimately connected with the other Pleistocene depos-
its of the country; it is at the same time a fossiliferous sedimentary de-
posit as intimately connected with the Neocene and Eocene formations
of the middle Atlantic slope as these are connected among themselves ;
and thus the formation not only covers the natural discontinuity be-
tween the Neocene and Pleistocene, but, since it is susceptible of classi-
fication with either, closes the taxonomic hiatus as well.t

There has long been grave uncertainty as to the relations among cer-
tain members of that Silurian or Cambrian rock series of the upper Mis-
sissippi Valley known in part as the Lower Magnesian Limestone of
Owen; and it is a source of gratification to geologists to note that, in
the second volume of his final report, N. H. Winchell has ‘clearly set
forth the relations of the various members of this series, particularly in
Minnesota and Wisconsin. The series, beginning at the base of the
well characterized St. Peter Sandstone, is as follows: (1) Shakopee
Limestone; (2) New Richmond Sandstone; (3) main body of limestone
(‘Lower Magnesian” in part); (4) Jordan Sandstone; (5) St. Lawrence
Limestone; (6) a bed of shales; (7) Dresbach Sandstone (the last four
representing the St. Croix); (8) a bed of shales; and (9) Hinckley
Sandstone (the last six constituting the Potsdam of Wisconsin); the
whole resting upon the red shales and sandstones which pass into the
copper-bearing series. t

One of the most puzzling problems which the geologists employed in
the western Territories have been called upon to solve is the absence
of formations elsewhere of great volume, without marked unconformity
between the older and newer deposits. This condition is especially con-
spicuous in the Rocky Mountains, where the Silurian is sometimes re-
duced to a few feet of shales or limestones, and is sometimes almost
unrecognizable. It is also conspicuous in the Black Hills, where, ac-
cording to Newton, the: Cambrian includes but 250 feet of sandstones
and quartzites, while the Silurian proper and the Devonian are absent,§
although there are no marked unconformities. Newton’s observations
were verified and the anomalous relation of the Biack Hills rocks dis-

cussed during the past year by Crosby ;* and it was shown that during
Silurian and Devonian time the region now upheaved as an isolated
mountain tract in the midst of a great continent must have been the bot-
tom of an ocean so broad and deep that sediments were not transported
to it in sufficient quantity to form deposits of any considerable volume—
that during a large part of the Paleozoic the region must have been
in much the same condition as are to-day the abyssmal depths of the
south Atlantic and Pacific, in which dredges gather modern shells, Ter-
tiary shark teeth, and Cretaceous otoliths at a single sweep.

The same author has recently discussed also the origin of the quartz-
ites, cherty concretions, and other siliceous aggregations found in deep-
sea deposits, and shown that they must result in large part from solu-
tion of the organic silica contained in sponge spicules, diatom shells,
etc., and subsequent deposition of the silica in the mineral form; the
mineral silica thus disseminated among the mechanical sediments some-
times segregating therefrom in solid nodules or the hollow bodies called

geodes.*
VULCANISM.

The recently renewed voleanic activity on the Hawaiian Islands led
to an interesting incident—i. e., a second visit to the islands by the
venerable Dana, for the purpose of re-examining in the light of modern
knowledge the phenomena studied by him half a century before. Cer-
tain results of the new observations were summarized in a general ”
discussion of voleanic action, in which the principal movements are
classified as follows: (1) the ascending movement of the liquid rock
in the subterrranean conduit of the volcano from the deep-seated
crustal or sub-erustal region of fusion; (2) the projection of the lava
aerially upward from the surface of the liquid lava in the vent, which is
accompanied by outflow whenever the height reached by the lavas is such
that thev find an outlet either over or through fissures in the walls of
theerater. Each of these operations (upflow and outflow) involves an
expulsion of material from subterranean regions; and a usual conse-
quence is (3) a subsidence or down plunge of the overlying rock or of
portions of the cone. These movements of upthrow, ejection, and sub-
sidence are the most universal and strongly marked of the entire series
of volcanic phenomena. Connected with them, there are in addition
however (4) the escape of vapors from the crater, and (5) displacements
and the opening of fissures.{ The last movements are frequently accom-
panied by earth tremors, and sometimes by destructive earthquakes.
These observations upon the behavior of living volcanoes throw light
upon the history of the extinct volcanoes whose craters, lava sheets, or
even “necks” alone remain for examination by the geologist.

Next to active volcanoes in significance to systematic geologists, and
in interest and instructiveness to laymen, come those recently extinct ;
and during the past two years such a volcano has been investigated by
Diller. This voleano is perhaps the most recent within the United
States. Its crater, overlooking Snag Lake 10 miles northeast of Lassen
Peak in northern California, is indeed cold, but the lapilli and scoria of
which it is composed have been scarcely affected by the action of the
elements, and its slopes are as high as such material will maintain;
the Java sheet which flowed from it, and which by damming a small
creek formed Snag Lake, is scarcely discolored by weatherimrg; the vol-
canic ashes which it vomited yet lie as they fell, little touched by the
winter rains or the summer thunder showers; the stumps of trees
smothered by the ashes and charred by the lava have not yet decayed ;
and all the phenomena indicate that this debris-swathed voleano was
in active operation but a few scores or at most a few hundreds of years
ago.*

This, although probably the youngest of the series, is only one of
those volcanoes which, beginning in early Tertiary time and culmi-
nating in activity about the Pliocene or early Pleistocene, flooded
hundreds of thousands of square miles of the Pacific slope with lava
sheets the most extensive of the globe. Most of the orifices from
which these lavas welled have been obliterated or buried by geologic
changes; but one of them remains, and is of such vast dimensions
that the water with which it is partly filled forms the deepest lake on
the continent. This ‘ Crater Lake,” which lies in the heart of the Cas-
cade range in southern Oregon, is 2,000 feet deep, and the bounding
walls rise 900 to 2,000 feet above its level. It was explored by Dutton
in 1886. t

Kilauea represents active vuleanism; Snag Lake represents the effects
of vuleanism yet untouched by time; Crater Lake is a mighty voleano
long dead and already mouldering into dust; the older lava sheets and
degraded craters of Oregon and northern California contain a record
of vulecanism partly effaced by the ever operative agencies of deg-
adation; but there is a still later stage in the obliteration of the vol-
canic record which has been brought to light within two years: About
Mount Taylor in northern New Mexico there is an extensive area now oe-
ecupied chiefly by sedimentary rocks of Mesozoic age, which have evi-
dently suffered great degradation during Cenozoic time; and through the
strata project cylindrical masses of basalt, sometimes large enough to
be dignified by the name of mountains, which evidently represent the
contents of the pipes or ducts through which lava was extruded during
past ages, probably in sufficient volume to sheet vast areas with lava, as
southern Oregon was sheeted during the later epoch; but these lava
sheets have been completely denuded over hundreds of square miles,

and nothing remains to indicate their existence save the indurated con.
tents of the pipes by which they were supplied. These remnants of
lava columns, or ‘‘ volcanic necks” as they are called by Dutton (by
whom they were discovered and interpreted), are among the most inter-
esting records of vulcanism extant, since by means of them the geologist
descends far into the crust of the earth toward the ultimate seat of vol-
canic action.

In the early days of geology there were two rival hypotheses concern-
ing the formation of the rocks of the earth, viz, the Plutonic and the
Neptunic. The battle between these doctrines raged for a generation
before the Neptunists gained the ascendancy; but it is now recognized
that by far the greater part of the rocks open to observation were de-
posited in the seas, and that only a subordinate part were extruded in
molten condition from the bowels of the earth. Yet a vestige of the
Plutonic hypothesis has persisted until to-day, particularly in Germany,
but to some extent in this country, in the form of a belief that the vol-
canic rocks of the earth represent a more or less definite series ranging
and gradually changing from the Archean to the Pliocene—that the la-
vas of the Paleozoic were unlike those of the Mesozoic, and these again
unlike those of the Cenozoic, and that the successive differences consti-
tute a record of the earth’s history, susceptible of an,interpretation only
less defiinite than that afforded by the suecession of organic life. This
belief (which must not be confounded with Richthofen’s induction con-
cerning the succession of rocks among the lavas of a particular province
and period, and Dutton’s admirable explanation of the law of that sueces-
sion) was so seriously Shaken when the results of the investigation of the
Washoe rocks of Nevada by Hague and Iddings were published * that
it has now been largely abandoned by German students and teachers.
So an American discovery has, within the biennial period, and in at
least one foreign country, practically revolutionized thought concern-
ing the succession and significance of voleanic rocks as geologic chro-
nometers.

Although sometimes unquestionably connected with general deforma-
tion, seismism or earthquake movement is known to accompany vol-
canic action in many eases. During the biennial period the most im-
portant contribution ever made to seismology—a contribution which
revolutionized earlier conceptions and placed the entire science upon a
new and firm foundation—emanated from the American geologist Dut-
ton, as the outcome of his studies of the Charleston earthquake of 1886.
The contribution includes two distinet conceptions: (1) It was found
on examining the means hitherto employed for ascertaining the depth
of earthquake foci that all involve sources of error of such magnitude
that the resulting determinations are worthless; and so a method was

* Bull. U. S. Geol. Survey, No. 23, 1886.
GEOLOGY. 251

devised which is dependent, not upon the always uncertain data hith-
erto employed, but upon observations of intensity which can be ver-
ified by independent observers even weeks or months after a great
shock, and in which the errors in judgment of the observer have com-
paratively little effect upon the result. In this method the various ob-
servations upon intensity are first mapped, and a center (which is the
epicentrum of the volcanic area) from which the intensities diminish in
all directions is found by simple inspection; the intensity observations
are then assembled and plotted in the order of their distance from this
center upon a diagram in which the ordinates represent intensities and
the abscissa distance from the epicentrum; when it is found that in all
cases there is a point of inflection in the intensity curve at a distance
from the epicentrum depending upon the depth of the centrum (or focus)
which can thus be determined by a simple formula. This methed of
determining the depth of earthquake foci is eminently satisfactory, and
is unquestionably destined to supplant all others in every case in which
it is applicable. By means of it the focus of the Charleston earthquake
was shown to be about 12 miles beneath the surface.* (2) Hitherto the
determinations of the velocity of earthquake transmission have been so
variable that the more cautious seismologists looked upon them with
suspicion. Now, owing partly to the extended use of standard time
throughout the United States, the time observations upon the Charles-
ton earthquake over the 850,000 square miles affected are satisfactory
beyond all precedent; these observations have been carefully reduced
and discussed (and in this work Dutton had the assistance of New-
comb), and a coefficient for the velocity of earthquake transmission, in-
comparably more trustworthy than the earlier determinations, has been
deduced. The mean result of the various observations gives a velocity
of 5,184-+ 80 meters per second. This coefficient, like the method of de-
termining the depth of earthquake foci, is unquestionably destined to
supplant all others, and so seismologists are now armed with new means
of prosecuting further researches upon the most mysterious of terres-
trial phenomena. But Dutton’s contributions are no less important to
the geologist than to the seismologist in that they coincide with exper-
iment and observation upon the elasticity, rigidity, density, and other
properties of solid and homogeneous rocks, and so throw light upon the
condition of the sub-erust of the earth far beyond the depths which di-
rect examination can ever reach.

ALTERATION.

The products of the alteration of rocks by the various agencies to
which they are subject are multifarious: The soils are formed by the
disintegration and decay of rocky strata; the sediments of seas and
lakes are first consolidated into rock, and sometimes subsequently

252 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

transformed from the clastic or amorphous to the crystalline form; min-
eral veins and ore deposits result from alterations due to heat, pressure,
and other conditions; gases are set free in the processes of alteration of
original sediments, and are sometimes accumulated in the rocks in great
volume; and soa large share of those geologic phenomena which are
of general economic interest result from processes of alteration of the
rocks of the earth. The products of many of these processes belong
rather to lithology and chemistry, or to the arts, than to geology; but
some of them fall within the legitimate field of the latter science.

Several years ago E. W. Hilgard proposed a classification of the soils
of certain Southern States by the conditions of their genesis; but cir-
cumstances prevented the application of this classification to the soils
of the country at large. During the past year Powell has adopted and
extended this genetic classification of soils, and proposes to apply it to
the entire country. Thus far the classification and the plan for its ap-
plication has been published only in brief; * but it may be added that
soil investigation has already been commenced in several divisions of
the U.S. Geological Survey, and that a number of soil maps have been
prepared and are shortly to be published. Agricultural geology is the
geology of the future; and although great progress in the study and
classification of soils has not yet been made, it is of interest to note
that the work has been definitely commenced during the biennial period,
and that important results will doubtless soon appear.

Two notable events in geologic progress during recent years are (1)
the discovery by Becker that enormous masses of erystalline rocks in
the Sierra Nevada Mountains, hitherto supposed to be Archean, are,
instead, matamorphosed sediments of Cretaceous age; and (2) the elu-
cidation of the genesis of the iron ores of the Lake Superior region by
Irving and Van Hise; but these events primarily belong rather to the
domain of lithology than geology.

In the history of the subjugation of natural forces for human weal
there is no more interesting episode than that of the utilization of the
unstable carbon compounds as fuels and illuminants. Wood and vari-
ous woody plants have been used as fuel, and animal fats and vegetal
oils as illuminants from time immemorial; and there is scarcely a
savage tribe to which: they are unknown. The advance from the use
of wood and charcoal to the burning of mineral coals was an easy one,
and was probably made gradually and independently in many centers
both during historic and pre-historic time. The last step in the utiliza-
tion of potential energy stored up in mineral substances was far longer
and was taken within our own memory; and, in consequence of the
ready communication of recent years between distant lands, was taken
in many parts of the world at about the same time. It is true that

GEOLOGY. 253

natural-gas vents were known to and were for ages venerated by the
fire- worshipers, whose cult they inspired; it is also true that springs
of mineral oil have been known from history’s dawn, and that the oil
was utilized sometimes as fuel or illuminant, though more commonly
as a medicine or lubricant ; and it is equally true that natural oils and
tars were extracted by primitive means and used for primitive pur-
poses by barbarous Oriental peoples long before their fame spread to
the Occident; but it is only within a few years that these natural
products have been utilized so extensively as to materially modify the
course of human progress.

Pari passu with the industrial development accompanying the utili-
zation of rock gas, geologic science made an unparalleled stride within
a few months. During the last thirty years Hunt, Newberry, Peck-
ham, Leslie, and several other geologists in this country, and Binney,
Coquand, Daubrée, Lartet, and others abroad have indeed made im-
portant contributions to our knowledge concerning the constitution and
origin of petroleum and its associates; and the exploitation of the
Pennsylvania-New York fields afforded valuable additional data relat-
ing to these minerals. Nearly four years ago Prof. I. C. White enun-
ciated and vigorously maintained the theory—now recognized as a
fundamental law in gas prognostication—that gas, oil, and brine are
accumulated in the order of their weight within inverted basins and
troughs formed by fiexure of the rocky strata. The importance of
these contributions to our knowledge of the lighter bitumens must not
be under-estimated; yet when exploitation for gas began in Ohio in
1886, the geologist literally sat at the feet of the prospecter gathering
such crumbs as fell from his hands, and found himself utterly unable
either to guide efforts or predict results. Less than two years later the
laws governing the distribution and accumulation of gas and oil were
so fully developed that the rock-gas problem claimed a solution as sat-
isfactory as that of the well-known artesian water problem ; and to-day
the geologist predicts the success or failure of a prospect bore for gas
or oil about as readily and reliably as he can prognosticate artesian
water, or coal. Greater advance was probably never before made in so
limited time in any economically important branch of knowledge. The
solution of the problem of rock gas and petroleum marks an era in
science no less than in industry. Vast sums of money, reaching some-
times into the millions, were spent by prospecters in gathering data;
but the credit for the solution of the problem belongs chiefly to three
individuals—I. C. White, of the University of West Virginia; Edward

‘Orton, State geologist of Ohio; and A. J. Phinney, a practicing physi-
cian and amateur geologist of Muncie, Indiana.

GLACIATION.

The general tendency of glaciation is to obliterate surface irregularity
both by grinding down elevations and by filling up depressions, and
thus to supplement hydric gradation; but glaciation may also accent-
254 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

uate pre-existing irregularities of surface, certainly by moraine-build-
ing and probably by basin-cutting, and must therefore be set apart as a
unique agent in the modification of the external configuration of the
globe. The study of living glaciers was commenced many years ago by
reason of the novelty of the subject and the paradoxical behavior of an
apparently rigid substance when accumulated in large mass; but it was
soon ascertained that glaciers are among the most potent of the geologic
agencies, and during recent years they have been studied chiefly with
the object of interpreting the frequently obscure records of glaciation
during past ages.

Among the most important researches upon modern glaciers made
during recent years are those of Holst upon the great mer de glace of
central Greenland, which have recently been summarized by Lindahl.*
These researches are of special value to students of the glacial phenom-
ena of America, since a considerable part of the mer de glace of Green-
land apparently occupies plains comparable in general features with
those of the Upper Mississippi Valley and the valley of the Great Lakes,
while most of the glaciers hitherto studied are constricted ice streams
flowing in mountain-bound valleys, whose behavior is determined
largely by the conditions these valleys impose. In the mountainous
parts of Greenland, as in the Alps and the northern Rockies the ice
is indeed crevasse-torn, diversified by bowlders and other débris de-
rived from projecting mountain tops, and sometiines broken by moulins,
into which small streams cascade; but over the plains the ice is gener-
ally continuous, and free from rocky or earthy superficial deposits (other
than the kryokonite which has so long puzzled students of Greenland
geology), though sometimes intersected by considerable superglacial
streams. Kryokonite was collected in considerable quantity by Holst,
carefully examined, and found to contain nothing but the ordinary com-
ponents of non-eruptive crystalline rocks in finely comminuted condi-
tion—quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase, two or three varieties of mica, horn-
blende, garnet, magnetite, and doubtful traces of titanite and epidote ;
but no metallic iron, nor the slightest trace of augite, olivine, or glass
were found. Inshort, the chemical composition and mechanical consti-
tution or kryokonite of Greenland is almost exactly identical with that
of the loess so extensively developed in and along the flanks of glaciated
regions generally. Holst’s observations agree exactly with the conclu-
sion previously reached by most American students of the loess, i. e.,
itis the finest flour of the ice-mill, which was swept into the glacial
Streams, and slowly deposited in rivers, lakes, and morasses as the flow
became sluggish or ceased.

Another notable study of living glaciers has been made by G. F.
Wright about Glacier Bay, in southern Alaska.t The observations

upon the rate of flow of Muir glacier, which embouches into the head
of the bay, are particularly interesting. The cross-section of the ice
stream is about 3,500,000 square feet (5,000 feet wide by about 700 feet
deep), and the mean flow is about 40 feet per day (70 feet in the cen-
ter and 10 feet near the margin) in the month of August. The Muir
glacier is now retreating, but it has evidently oscillated considerably
during recent times, and in some of its advances it has encroached upon
and buried beneath its ground moraine and aqueoglacial deposits,
whole forests of full-grown trees, Whose remains occasionally appear
about the shores of the bay.

It was an early notion that during glacial times great ice-caps formed
about the poles and extended far toward the equator; and during one
stage in the development of geologic science mathematicians sought to
compute the effects of these hypothetic ice-caps, first, upon the volume
of the oceans from which they were drawn, second, upon the isostatic
terrestrial crust on which they were heaped, and third, upon the cen-
ter of gravity of the earth as-a whole. The students of more recent
years have, however, settled down to the more temperate conviction
that great polar ice-caps never existed, and that during the glacial pe-
riod the ice flowed radially from certain “centers of dispersion” (so
called by Lyell). This view has recently received strong support from
a new quarter: Within the last decade the Canadian geologists have
shown that the strie which form the unmistakable trail of glaciers ex-
tend from the Laurentide plateau southwesterly toward Lake Superior
and the Red River, westerly toward Lake Winnipeg, and northerly and
even northeasterly toward Hudson’s Strait,* proving that these high-
lands were the center of dispersion for the mer de glace by which
northeastern United States was overflowed. These Canadian obser-
vatious have continued until within the last year or two, and have set-
tled forever the fate of the ice-cap hypothesis. During the past two
years, too, parallel observations have been made in the northwestern
part of the American continent: G. M. Dawson and other officers of the
Geological Survey of Canada have ascertained that the strix of the
Mackenzie Valley extend in northerly directions, proving that the north-
ern Rockies also formed an independent center of ice dispersion.t Daw-
son’s publication upon the glacial phenomena of Canada is of special
interest to American geologists in that it contains definite recognition
or the glacial theory, essentially in the form long held in America but
rejeviod in Canada.

The various American observations upon glacial striw have just been
assembled, graphically depicted upon a remarkably instructive map,
and discussed at length by the foremost living authority upon glacial

matters, President Chamberlin.* These American observations agree
with those made on the other side of the northern lakes and the forty-
ninth parallel; and it is now possible to map approximately the area
glaciated during the Pleistocene, and to represent moreover the form
and direction of movement of each principal lobe and tongue of the
Mer de Glace during some period of its existence.

The last-named geologist has also recently described the phenomena
of the Driftless area of the Upper Mississippi—a tract of over 15,000
square miles, which was completely encompassed, though never over-
swept, by the ice, and atone time partly or wholly submerged beneath
the waters of an ice-bound lake; and from moraines, aqueo-glacial gray-
els, and other products of the combined action of water and ice found
about the periphery of the tract, he has deduced a history of the Pleisto-
cene more extended and refined than any previously recorded. The
epochs in this history are: (1) The Transition Epoch, not yet satisfac-
torily distinguished from the Pliocene; (2) the Earlier Glacial Epoch,
comprising an episode of glaciation, an episode of deglaciation and veg-
etal accumulation, and a second episode of glaciation accompanied by
deposition of the loess; (5) the Chief Interglacial Epoch, with vegetal
accumulation, ete.; (4) the Later Glacial Epoch, comprising at least
three episodes of glaciation and moraine-building and two of deglacia-
tion and vegetal accumulation ; (5) the Champlain Epoch of.marine
and lacustral sedimentation ; and (6) the Terrace Epoch, which grad-
uates into the present. t

The history of the Pleistocene and of its relations to the Tertiary has
recently been read in a slightly different way from a different series of
deposits (including the Columbia formation) by McGee: The geologic
history recorded in the Columbia deposits and terraces and in the ero-
sion and alteration which both have suffered is almost wholly supple-
mentary to that read by most geologists in the later glacial deposits,
and multiplies many times the length of the Pleistocene as commonly
conceived. Collectively the two series of deposits indicate that the
Pleistocene consisted of two, and only two, great epochs of cold (the
later comprising two or more sub-epochs); that these epochs were sep-
arated by an interval three, five, or ten times as long as the post-glacial
interval; that the earlier cold endured much the longer; that the ear-
lier cold was the less intense, and the resulting ice sheet stopped short
(in the Atlantic slope) of the limit reached by the later; that the ear-
lier glaciation was accompanied by much the greater submergence, ex-
ceeding 400 feet at the mouth of the Hudson and extending 500 miles
southward, while that of the later reached but a titbe of that depth or
southing; and that during the long interglacial interval the condition
of Jand and sea was much as at present. t

_ Thereis no subject in geology of wider popular and scientific interest
than that of the relation between human chronology and geolegic his-
tory, and for two generations geologists have sought to determine tlie
remoteness of the latest episode of geology—the last ice invasion—in
terms of written history. Up to about a dozen years ago the current
estimates of the duration of the post-glacial epoch generally ran from
100,000 to 150,000 or 200,000 years; but about that time a number of
American geologists began to make shorter estimates, based on new
data, generally ranging from five or six thousand to ten or fifteen
thousand years; and since that time the one hundred thousand year
and the ten thousand year estimates for the post-glacial period have
both had their advocates, though of late the ten thousand year men
have been in the ascendant. The chronometers were various, and many
of them manifestly unreliable. Probably the most reliable of them all
is that afforded by the gorge of the Mississippi between Fort Snelling
and St. Anthony’s Falls, in Minnesota, to which attention was directed
several years ago by N. H. Winchell. The gorge is walled by the fria-
ble St. Peter sandstone and a thin cap of firm Trenton limestone by
which the sandstone 1s protected above, and the relations of the gorge
to the adjacent glacial deposit are such as to prove that it was exca-
vated by the retrogression of the falls from the present confluence of
the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers at Fort Sne!ling to their present
position. This distance is about 8 miles. Now the gorge was first vis-
ited and mapped by Hennepin in 1680; the position was again recorded
by Carver in 1756, by Pike in 1805, by Long in 1817, by Keating in
1823, by Featherstonehaugh in 1835, and by engineers of the U.S. Army
in 1856; while the present position is known and comparison of the
several maps indicate the rate of retrogression of the falls during the
two hundred and seven years between 1680 and the time of the latest
survey. If this rate be assumed to have been constant from the close
of the glacial period to the present, the entire period covered by the
retrogression was about eight thousand years.* This agrees with Gil-
bert’s primary estimate of the period of excavation of the Niagara
gorge.

One of the most interesting and important lines of investigation in
glacial geology undertaken within recent years is that so successfully
pursued by Chamberlin upon the terminal moraines built by the Pleis-
tocene ice sheet during certain stages of its existence. The same phe-
nomena have also been studied in this country by Upham, Cook,
Wright, Lewis, Salisbury, Todd, Leverett, and others, and the number,
extent, and significance in glacial geology of the American moraines
have been brought out in an eminently satisfactory manner by these
students.

It has been a constant surprise to American glacialists that parallel
phenomena were not recorded by the geologists of Europe; and it was
a source of something more than surprise to European geologists that
the Americans should find so remarkable phenomena in one of two re-
gions of practically identical Pleistocene history, while none such were
found in the other. So one of the most interesting events of the last
year to American and European glacialists is the discovery of several
well-developed terminal moraines in north Germany by the American
geologist Salisbury during a visit to that country.* These moraines
agree in all leading characteristics with those of this country; and the
discovery will unquestionably open a new field of research, and a new
vista opening into the past history of the world in Europe, as the ear-
lier discovery did a decade past for this country.

Among the results of the detailed work of American glacialists dur-
ing the last decade is the discovery that the great mer de glace of the
Pleistocene was not a homogeneous and uniform ice field moving in the
same direction in all its parts, but rather a series of great tongue-like
lobes extending in different directions and to various lengths upon the
interior plains of North America; and some of the most interesting
lines of investigation of glacial phenomena pursued by Chamberlin and
his contemporaries relate to the forms, positions, and inter-relations of
these lobes, and to their connection with the system of terminal mo-
raines extending from Long Island to Montana, to the drift sheet bor-
dered by these moraines, and to the aqueoglacial deposits into which
both moraines and drift sheets merge. Thus, during the last decade,
glacial geology has passed far beyond that initial stage of segregation
in which ol;jective phenomena are simply assembled and described to
form a basis of study, and well into that stage of differentiation which
accompanies a wider growth of knowledge.

One of the students of the American ice-lobes was Lewis, and when
he visited Great Britain, two years ago, his practiced eye and trained
judgment at once perceived evidences of similar lobation of the ice sheet
which. plowed over the British Isles during the Pleistocene. So in
another way the seed of American thought has borne fruit in Europe
and Eastern science has been stimulated by the introduction of West-
ern methods, and another tittle of the intellectual debt of the new con-
tinent to the old abated.

RESUME.

Several important conceptions in geologic science have sprung into
being in America during the past two years; many old conceptions
have been modified and extended; and some conceptions hitherto di-
verse have been brought into harmony ; and so, in a third way, knowl-

* Am. Jour. Sci. 1888, vol. xxxv, pp. 401-7.
GEOLOGY. 259

edge has been extended. <A few of the leading events in the foregoing
history of the growth of conception are worthy of special distinction :

First in importance, by reason of its broad philosophic bearing, must
be mentioned the transition from a purely objective or empiric classifi-
cation in geology to the more logical, simple, comprehensive, and nat-
ural classification by processes or by fundamental principles and laws—
a transition commenced some years since, but now so well advanced as
to be a legitimate subject of permanent record.

Second in importance must be ranked the birth of the New Geology,
which interprets geologic history from the records of degradation as the
old geology interpreted history from the records of deposition, and thus
greatly extends the domain of the science.

Next in importance must be placed the invention of a method of de-
termining the depth of earthquake centers and the determination of
the velocity of earthquake transmission, which together have not only
revolutionized seismology and placed it upon a solid foundation, but
have enlightened geologists as to the constitution of the sub-crust of
the earth. These three steps in progress are epoch-marking, and the
last in particular must be credited wholly to the biennial period just
closed.

Important place must be given to the recognition and definition of
a great geologic group—the Algonkian—by which the known geologic
column is greatly extended and known geologic history greatly ex-
panded. Like this discovery in kind are the recognition of a sub-group
of rocks corresponding toa part of the geologic column—the Lower
Cretaceous—hitherto recognized in Europe, but not on the American
continent, and the correct determination of the succession of the sub-
ordinate divisions of the Silurian and Cambrian in the structurally
complex and bitterly contested field beyond the Hudson. To the stu-
dent of stratigraphy these events are epoch-marking.

Turning now from the subject matter of the science and the growth
of knowledge with respect to this subject matter, and toward the means
by which the science is developed, another epoch-marking event ap-
pears in the organization of the Geological Society of America, by
which investigation will inevitably be stimulated and knowledge ad-
vanced more rapidly than ever before; and in the same category must
be placed the establishment of a national geologic periodical, the Ameri-
can Geologist. And the birth of State geologic surveys in Arkansas
and Texas must also be mentioned.

Many other notable steps have been taken with respect both to the
means and the ends of geology; but even if there were none other these
great strides would render the period 1887, 1888 memorable.

NECROLOGY.

In another and more painful way the biennial period, and particu-
larly the year 1888, is memorable; for the mortality among geologists
was unusual:

JAMES C. BOOTH, one time State geologist of Delaware, died at Philadelphia, March
21, 1888, aged seventy-eight years.

ALBERT D. HAGER, once an assistant on the geological survey of New Hampshire,

FERDINAND V. HAYDEN, geologist and explorer, long director of the U. 8. Geolog-
ical and Geographical Survey of the Western Territories, died at Philadelphia,
December 22, 1887, aged fifty-nine years.

ROLAND DUER IRVING, professor of geology in the State University of Wisconsin,
and geologist on the U. 8. Geological Survey, died at Madison, May 30, 1888, aged
forty-five years.

the Atlantic, one time a geologist on the second geological survey of Pennsyl-

NORTH AMERICAN PALEONTOLOGY FOR 1887 AND 1888.

By HENRY S. WILLIAMS.

INTRODUCTION.

In writing this report some modifications from the plan heretofore
adopted have been made. The report attempts to consider only such
works as refer to the Paleontology of North America. It has been
found impossible in the present state of the science to classify the lit-
erature on biological lines entirely, as is done in the excellent Annuaire
Géologique of Carez and Douvillé (22). I have consulted several re-
ports of a similar nature, from which I have adopted some suggestions.
Among these are the previous reports of Mr. Marcou (156, 157), the
geological record by Messrs. Whitaker and Dalton (277), by Messrs.
Topley and Sherborn (244), Bulletin No. 44 of the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey, by N. H. Darton (60); Les Progrés de la Géologie, by M. Margerie
(158); the Annuaire Géologique of Carez and Douvillé (22), and the
preceding volumes of the same work by Dr. Dagincourt (57); the Neues
Jahrbuch of Messrs. Baur, Dames, and Liebische (11).

One feature I have added which has not been attempted by any of
these publications so faras I have ascertained. Ihave quoted the names
of new species and genera proposed in the various publications, and in
each case have noted the page and, wherever illustrations have been
given, the number of the plate and figure, in order that the report may
bring before working paleontologists a list of the new species which
can be referred to when the original publications are not accessible.

The reviews of the various publications have been necessarily brief,
and are printed separately from the bibliographical list. The contents
are arranged in the following order:

General Paleontology: General Paleontology—Continnued.
Cambrian. Carboniferous and Permian.
Silurian, lower and upper. Mesozoic.

Devonian. Cenozoic.

261
262 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Special Paleontology: Special Paleontology—Continued.
Invertebrates: Mollusca.
Protozoa, Sponges, and Eo- Arthropoda.
zoon. Vertebrates.
Corals. Vegetal Paleontology.
Crinoids. List of abbreviations.
Molluscoida. Bibliography.

This arrangement has been found necessary because the publications,
as before stated, are not capable of classification on purely biological
lines. So long as itis necessary for the paleontologist to report upon all
the collections obtained in the course of a reconnaissance, or during
the year’s work of a geological survey, as means of defining the strati-
graphical divisions of geology, fossils of all kinds are liable to be con-
sidered in the same treatise, and it is only where specialists take up the
consideration of the fossils in their biological grouping, that we have a
literature differentiated in this way. Some works will be referred to
the biological sections which are not thorough treatises from the biolog-
ical point of view, while others are placed in the geological sections be-
cause the treatment is confined to the fossils of one system or to the
study of the characteristics of the fossils as they appear in some partic-
ular zone.

THE CAMBRIAN.

N.S. Shaler (236), and again in conjunction with August F. Foerste
(237), has discussed the geology and the fauna of the Cambrain district
of North Attleborough and Bristol County, Massachusetts. The fol-
lowing species are described as new:

Obolella? p. 27, pl. i, f. 2.

Lamellibranch? p. 28, pl. i, f.5.

Stenotheca curvirostra, p. 30, pl. i, f. 8.

Pleurotomaria (Raphistoma) attleborensis, p. 30, pl. ii, f. 11.

Hyolithes quadricostatus, p. 31, pl. ii, f. 15.

Salterella curvatus, p. 34, pl. ii, f. 22.

Microdiscus belli-marginatus, p. 35, pl. ii, f.19.

Paradoxides walcotti, p. 36, pl. ii, f.12. The author adds ‘‘ Paradowides tenellus,
Billings, is in size like this species, but very distinct. It is interesting to
find a Paradoxides in the Olenellus Cambrian, since its occurrence there
diminishes the importance of the Paradoxides Cambrian as a Paradoxides
division.”

C. D. Walcott (258) discusses the age of the roofing slate of Gran-
ville, Washington County, New York. The thin-bedded limestones, im-
bedded in the gray and purple slates of Middle Granville, have yielded
fossils which the author identifies with species of the Olenellus or Geor-
gian fauna of the Cambrian. The red slates, in a note, are said to be

of the Hudson River formation. Ina second paper (265) the same author
PALEONTOLOGY. 263

presents an important revision of former views in regard to the order of
succession of the Cambrian faunas of North America. The discovery
of an unbroken section in Manuel’s Brook, Conception Bay, Newfound-
land, extending from the Archzean Gneiss upward through the Olenellus
and to the Paradoxides fauna, confirms the order for these faunas pre-
-viously recognized in Sweden. The author announces the following
revised classification of the Cambrian, showing this to be the true order
of succession of the several terranes of the Cambrian in North America:

(1) Lower Cambrian (Georgia, Prospect, Terra Nova terranes) with
the Olenellus fauna; (2) Middle Cambrian (St. John, Avalan and Brain-
tree terranes) with the Paradoxides fauna; (3) Upper Cambrian (Pots-
dam, Knox, Tonto, Belle Isle, etc., terranes) with the Diceliocephalus or
Olenellus fauna. This article is an abstract of remarks made by the
author before the International Geological Congress in London, in the
course of discussion on the Cambrian system, on September 18, 1888.

R. P. Whitfield (298) records the discovery of fossils from the Birds-
eye limestone at Fort Cassin, Vermont, on the eastern shore of Lake
Champlain. The paper is an extract from Bulletin No.8, of the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History, not yet published.

C. Rominger (228) describes as new species certain fossils from Mount
Stephens, Northwest Territory of Canada, as follows:

Ogygia klotzi, p. 12, pl. i, f. 1.

Ogygin serrata, p. 13, pl. i, f. 2, 2a.

Embolimus spinosa (gen. et sp. nov.), p. 15, pl. i, f. 3.
Embolimus rotundata, p. 16, pl. i, i. 4, 5.
Conocephalites cordillere, p. 17, pl. i, f. 7.

He also recognizes the forms Monocephalus salteri, Bill., Bathyurus,
Agnostus, Obolella, and a Theca resembling T. primordialis, Hall. Ba-
thyurus ?, p. 18, pl. 1, f. 8. Agnostus ?, p. 18, pl. 1, f.1 (compare A. integer,
Barr). :

Mr. Walcotc (264) criticises this paper, and Mr. Rominger replies to
the criticism in the American Geologist, vol. I, pp. 356-359. (See also
note, Am. Geol., vol. I, p. 61.)

In the article by C. D. Walcott (264) an account is given of fossils
derived from the same locality as that from which Mr. Rominger’s fos-
sils came. Mr. Walcott compares the species with the Nevada fauna of
the Cambrian, the order of sequence of which is already known, and
from his comparison concludes that “ the Mount Stevens fauna should
be referred to about the horizon of the upper portion of the Middle Cam-
brian fauna.” (This determination is prior to Mr. Walcott’s discov-
eries inJNewfoundland). (See 265.) Of the new genus and five new spe-
cies described by Mr. Rominger, Mr. Walcott shows that the name Hm-
bolimus is preoccupied by Westwood; that Hmbolimus spinosa, Romin-
ger, 1887, was previously described as Olenoides spinosus by Walcott in
1886, (Bull. U. 8. Geol. Survey, No. 30, p. 184, pl. xxv, f. 6), and is
therefore a synonym, and that Hmbolimus rotundata, Rominger, 1887,
264 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

is identical with his species Bathyuriscus Howelli of the same Bulletin
(p. 216, pl. xxx, f. 2, 2a), and is also a synonym. The species Ole-
noides spinosus was recognized previously as generically distinct from
Olenoides, and Mr. Walcott therefore proposes (p. 168) the name Za-
canthoides (gen. nov.) tor this and congeneric species. By comparison
of specimens he also found that Rominger’s Ogygia serrata is a synoym
for Olenoides Nevadensis, Meek, and “that Conocephalites Cordillere
Rom. = Ptychoparia Cordillere Rom., sp., and Ogygia ? ? Klotei Rom.
are new to the previously known Cambrian fauna.”

W. B. Dwight (76, 77, 78) announces the discovery of the Olenellus
fauna of the Cambrian in the Wappinger Valley limestone of Dutchess
County, New York.

Henry Hicks (106), in the Geological Magazine, reviews the recent
work done by ©. D. Walcott and G. F. Matthew in the study of the
faunas of the Cambrian rocks of North America.

Charles Lapworth (144) publishes evidence of the presence of the
lower or Olenellus fauna in Shropshire, England, and gives tables of
European series to parallel the American tables of the faunas of the
Cambrian prepared by Mr. Walcott.

G. F. Matthew has contributed a number of interesting papers in re-
gard to the Paleontology of the Cambrian (167, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173,
174, 175). The subjects of the papers published in the American Jour-
nal of Science (171) and in the Canadian Record of Science (169) are
apparently more fully discussed in the paper (167) which appears in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for 1887. In these va-
rious papers the author discusses the discovery and the characters of a
large Trilobite which is described as new (in the Am. Jour. Sci., vol.
XXXIII, p. 389) under the name Paradowxides regina, from Band Ie, St.
John group, St. John, New Brunswick. This species is figured of the
natural size in the Transactions of the Reyal Society ; a small cut illus-
trates it in the American Journal article. This is said to be the largest
Paradoxides at present known. Its size and that of other large Trilo-
bites are given in the Royal Society paper, and this one is estimated to be
45 by 35 centimeters in length and width. The front part of the gla-
bella is wanting in the specimen.

In the first part of this article (173) the author gives reasons for the
opinion that the tracks observed in the oldest Cambrian rocks of Swe-
den, and called by Dr. Otto Torell Arenicolites gigas, and afterwards
changed to Psammichnites gigas, which are also found in the Acadian
rocks, are tracks of a gigantic marine worm.

In the latter part of this paper the author tabulates the Trilobites of
the first stage of the Acadian series, and indicates their relationship to
each other, and the geological position and range of each species. These
Trilobites are classified in four groups; the first, Agnostus and Micro-
discus—eyeless and with short thorax; second, Conocoryphine—eyeless
and with long thorax; third, Ptychoparide and Ellipsocephalida—the
PALEONTOLOGY. 265

smaller forms with eyes; fourth, the Paradowides. This table is found
also-in the Royal Society paper (167).

In the paper (169) in the Canadian Record of Science the author dis-
cusses the characters of Ptychoparide and Ellipsocephalide, which are
dwelt upon more at length in the paper,.above referred to, in the Trans-
actions of the Royal Society. From the study of the head-shield of the
young of several genera, the author concludes that they have the fol-
lowing relative rank to each other, those which show the more primi-
tive features coming first, viz: (1) Hllipsocephalia, (2) Agraulos, (3)
Liostracus, (4) Ptychoparia, (5) Solenopleura.

In the fuller paper in the Transactions of the Royal Society he the
author describes the following species :

Paradozides regina, p. 119, pl. iii (nat. size).
Ellipsocephalus, sp.? p. 129, pl. ii, f. 8 a-e.
Agraulos (?) Whitfieldianus, p. 130, pl. ii, f. 1 a-f.
var. compressa, p. 131, pl.i, f. 1 g-#.
Strenuella (?) Halliana, p. 132, pl.i, f. 2 a—m.
Solenopleura Acadica, var. elongata, p. 159, pl. ii, f. 6.

Plates i and ii illustrate series of young forms of the following gen-
era: Agraulos, Liostracus, Ptychoparia, Solenopleura, and Ellipsocepha-
lus.

The tabulation of the trilobites of the acadian is given as in the
paper (173) above referred to, and the author separates Microdiscus from
Agnostus, considering the former to be in advance, in degree of develop-
ment, of Agnostus, to present more variations of form, and to possess
a greater range of variability in the number of rings in the axis of the
pygidium. The third and fourth groups show achangein the eye lobe;
the fourth group completes this change earlier in its development than
does the other. The granulated test is regarded as indicative of the
earlier species of Paradoxides. The author remarks upon the very great
importantance of the early stages of Agraulos, Liostracus, and Soleno-
pleura, “as showing the plastic condition of the organism in the initial
metamorphoses. One has only to note in the series of embryonic and
larval forms how different the embryos are from the adult; and yet to
observe also how soon the generic and even the specific types become
visible in the larval head shield, to be satisfied that the main potentiality
of development is in the embryo and the embryonic stages of the
organism.”

The period 1887 and 1888 is notable for the accumulation and clear
presentation of facts to show the impropriety of the retention in our
geological nomenclature of the name “ Taconic system” of Emmons.

The discusion of the subject has been continued for half'a century,
and many of the ablest geologists of the country have been engaged in
it, starting with Messrs. Dewey, Eaton, and Emmons. It was origi-
nally proposed by Emmons as a subdivision including the rocks lying
below the “ Champlain Division” of the “New York system” and above
the Primordial rocks. Messrs. H. D. Rogers, E. Hitchcock, Mather,
266 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

James Hall, Vanuxem, Hunt, Marcou, Barrande, and Logan were the
chief disputants in the early part of the discussion, and in its later
stages the more prominent participants were Dana, Billings, Hall, Hunt,
Hitchcock, W. B. Dwight, Dale, Bishop, Ford, C. D. Walcott, with a
number of other writers, who as advocates or opponents, have defended
or opposed those more immediately engaged in the investigations.

The original idea was the erection of a new system stratigraphically
anterior to the then prominent ‘* New York system” (1842), and at first
fossils did not enter into the consideration, but the character and the
stratigraphical position of the rocks were alone considered, the suppo-
sition being that the ‘“‘ Taconic system” was an unfossiliferous series
of rocks lying above the Primordial, but below the fossiliferous Palzo-
zoic rocks. Early inthe discussion fossils were discovered, which caused
the ‘‘ Taconic system” to come into competition with the ‘“ Cambrian
system” of Sedgwick, but it was not until comparatively recently that
the rocks of the so-called ‘‘ Taconic system” were known to contain
fossils of the Lower Silurian or “Champlain Division” of the early
New York geologists. The investigations of the last few years, mainly
by the discovery of fossils, have conclusively shown that the rocks in-
cluded in the ‘Taconic system ” of Emmons are stratigraphically partly
anterior but in a large measure newer than the Potsdam sandstone;
that they are disturbed, metamorphosed, faulted, and do not constitute
a continuous series of rocks, but several interrupted masses. The im-
propriety of retaining the name has been elucidated by the evidence of
fossils, by showing that the rocks called ‘Taconic ” by Emmons do not
constitute a geological system, as the term is applied by geologists, in
that they are made up of rocks belonging to several geological horizons,
separated by breaks in the series, and that “the system ” as conceived
by Emmons is not pre-Potsdam, but contains some rocks as much above
as others are below that horizon. Hence, ifthe term ‘ Taconic system ”
were to be adopted, if used in the original sense, it would not be ap-
plicable to any other known series of rocks; if modified to fit it to
modern facts, it would not be applicable to the Taconic area.

Although defended by strong advocates on the geological side, the
settlement of the problem is due chiefly to paleontology, and the pro-
longed extension of the dispute has resulted from the absence of the
paleontological evidence which has come to light chiefly through the
investigations of Messrs. Dwight, Dana, Ford, Bishop, and Walcott.

During the years 1887 and 1888 the following papers of a more or less
palzeontological nature were written upon this subject. Mr. J. P. Bishop
(17) had shown in 1886 by fossils that the fossiliferous limestones occur-
ring in Columbia County, on the western border of the Taconic slates,
were of the age of the Hudson River shales.

©. D. Walcott (257, 260, 262) gives an account of the fossils discovered
in the lowest quartzites, in the limestones,and in the Upper Taconic of
Emmons.
PALEONTOLOGY. 267

In the paper in the American Journal of Science (260) he describes
the following new species characteristic of the fauna of the so-called
“ Taconic” of Emmons.

Linguiella Granvillensis, p. 188, pl. i, f. 15-15e.
Linnarssonia Taconica, p. 189, pl. i, f. 18-18d.

Orthis Salemensis, p. 190, pl. i, f. 17-17a.
Hyolithellus micans, var. rugosa, nu. var., p. 191, pl. i, f. 10.
Modiolopsis (2?) prisca, p. 191, pl. i, f. 19.

Leperditia (1) dermatoides, p. 192, pl. i, f. 13-134.
Aristozoe rotundata, p. 193, pl. i, f. 9.

Microdiscus connexus, p. 194, pl. i, f. 4-40.

Olenoides Fordi, p. 195, pl. i, f. 5-5d.

Solenopleura (?) tumida, p. 196, pl. i, f. 2-2a.
Ptychoparia Fitchi, p. 197, pl. i, f. 6.

Ptychoparia (?) (subgenus ?) clavata, p. 198, pl. i, f. 3.

In the ‘‘ Lower Taconic” (262) he records the discovery of Hyolithes, -
Nothozoe Vermontana, and Olenellus Asaphoides in the quartzites, and
Maclurea, Murchisonia, and Raphistoma in the eastern limestone.

Raphael Pumpelly (223) communicates a note on the fossils of Little-
ton, New Hampshire. These fossils were reported by T. Nelson Dale,
and were determined by C. D. Walcott and C. Rominger, by whom they
were referred to the Niagara age, while Billings determined other fos-
sils, derived from the same formations by C. H. Hitchcock, to be of
Helderberg age. In a note in the American Journal, vol. XXXVI, p.
255, it is stated that C. H. Hitchcock referred these fossils to the Ni-
agara group. (See Whitfield, Amer. Journ. Sci., vol. xxv, p. 369.)

In 1888 Mr. Walcott (262) and Professor Dana (59) showed the im-
propriety of continuing the use of the name “ Taconic system,” and Mr.
Marcou (154, 155) defended the usage of “ Taconic.” In the meeting of
the International Congress at London the facts regarding the discovery
of fossils of the faunas of the Lower Silurian appeared as conclusive
argument against the recognition of the ‘‘ Taconic System,” and theterms
“ Cambrian,” ‘“ Lower Silurian,” and “ Upper Silurian” were accepted
for the three lower systems of the Palozoie.

THE SILURIAN, LOWER AND UPPER.

Henry M. Ami has published several brief articles on the Paleontol-
ogy of the Paleozoic rocks in Canada (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9). In vol. I of
the Ottawa Naturalist (3) the author refers to the occurrence of Siphono-
treta Scotica, Davidson, in association with a fauna of the Utica forma-
tion in a band of impure limestone on the banks of the Rideau River,
near Ottawa. In the transactions of the Field Naturalists’ Club (8) he
gives further account of the Utica fossils from Rideau, and notes their
position in the section which he examined along Crichton street. Sev-
eral species are recorded as new to the locality, and two, marked as
new species, are referred to Ambonychia and Metoptoma. In the article
in the Canadian Record of Science (9) he discusses the fossils from the
268 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Utica formation at Point-4 Pic. No new species are named, but a rep-
resentative of the genus Siphonotreta is described in detail and com-
pared with Siphonotreta Scotica of Davidson and S. micula, McCoy.

T. W. Edwin Sowter (243) offers some notes on the Chazy formation
at Aylmer, Province of Quebec. He proposes the following new forms,
giving brief descriptions, but no specific names:

Murchisonia n. sp., p. 13.
Euomphalus —— sp. ? p. 14.
Plewrotomaria n. sp., p. 14.
Pleurotomaria (Scalites) n. sp., p. 14.
Metoptoma n. sp., p. 14.

S. W. Ford (88) comments upon certain fossils discovered in Quebec.
The fossils were sent the author by A. R. C. Selwyn, director of the
Canadian Survey, and the study of them indicates to the author a
horizon equivalent to the ‘* Levis” formation of the Canadian geolo-
gists. ;

Charles Lapworth (143,145) gives an account of some Graptolites dis-
covered in Kicking Horse Pass, Manitoba, British Columbia, and on
the south side of the St. Lawrence and on the north shore of the island
of Orleans, and from near Quebec.

A. F. Foerste has added considerably to the list of species from the
Paleozoic of Ohio. In the paper (80) in the Bulletin of Denison Uni-
versity, vol. 11 (1887), the author has described the following species
from the Clinton group of Ohio:

Acidaspis Ortoni, p. 90, pl. viii, f. 1 (described and figured as Acidaspis, vol. I,
p. 101, pl. xiii, f. 23).

Dictyonema scalariforme, p. 108, pl. viii, f. 28, 29.

In Part 11 of the same bulletin (81) he describes the Bryozoa [Poly-
zoa| of the Clinton group of Ohio; several genera and species are fig-
ured and described, and the following new species are named, described,
and figured: (In his nomenclature he has followed the classification of
E. O. Ulrich.)

In vol. 11, Part 1 (1888), of the same bulletin he publishes (54) some
notes on the Paleozoic fossils, and describes the following new species :
Lichas Halli, p. 118, pl. xiii, f. 4.
Encrinurus Browningi, p. 122, pl. xiii, f. 7.

U. P. and Joseph F. James contribute an article (130) in the Journal
Cincinnati Society of Natural History, on the Monticuliporoid Corals
of the Cincinnati group, with a revision of the species. The work con-
sists principally-of a critical re-arrangement of the species heretofore
described, of which a great number have been described by E. O.
Ulrich. The authors attempt to make no new species, and the only new
form described is Monticulipora hospitalis, var. neglecta (var. nov.), vol.
xe op. 20; pls, f..3:

F. J. H. Merrill (179) reports the discovery of fossils in a limestone
on the Green Pond Mountain of New Jersey, which he identifies as
belonging to a Lower Helderberg fauna. Rocks of the Paleozoic (from
Oneida to Hamilton) epochs are recognized.

Fred. H. Newell (200a) describes the following new species of Ni-
agara Cephalopods from northern Indiana:

Gomphoceras Wabashensis, pp. 470-473, 3 wood-cuts.
Gomphoceras linearis, pp. 473-475, 2,wood-cuts.
Gomphoceras angustum, pp. 475-476, 1 wood-cut.

EK. N. 8. Ringueberg (225) reports the following new species from the

Niagara shales of western New York:
Buthotrepis gregaria, p. 131, pl. vii, f. 1.
Inocaulis anastomatica, p. 131, pl. vii, f. 2.
Dendrocrinus celsus, p. 132, pl. vii, f. 3.

In another paper (226) the same author gives lists of the species rec-
ognized in the following zones, which he has studied. To these zones
he applies the names the Niagara Transition group, the Niagara shales,
and the Homocrinus band.

The following species are described and figured by George B. Simp-
son (240) in a paper entitled ‘* Descriptions of new species of fossils from

THE DEVONIAN.

Robert Bell (15) in his Report G of the Annual Report of the Geo-
logical Survey of Canada for 1886, notes the occurrence of fossiliferous
limestones in the valley of the At-ta-wa-pish-kat and Albany Rivers.
These fossils were submitted to Prof. J. F. Whiteaves, the paleontolo-
gist of the Survey, who identified them as indicating Devonian faunas
(pp. 27, G-33, G). The species reported are mainly corals and brachio-
pods; Mr. Whiteaves thinks them of a Lower Devonian horizon. No
new species are defined.

S. Calvin (21) records the fact of the appearance of a coral-bearing
zone intercalated between two brachiopod zones in the Hamilton rocks
in western Ontario, and remarks upon the different form assumed by
the Spirifera mucronata of the first and third zones. The same author
(20) describes a new genus and species of tubicolar Annelida from the
Hamilton period, Roberts’s Ferry, lowa; these are Streptindites (gen.
nov.), p. 27, and S. acervularie (sp. nov.), p. 27. No illustrations are
given.

J. M. Clarke (28) gives an account of the Annelid teeth from the De-
vonian of Ontario County, New York. Twenty-nine specimensof these
teeth are figured, twenty-two of which express varieties of form ap-
pearing in the Black Shale of Naples, and are regarded as varieties
of the form described by Hinde under the name of Polygnathus dubius.
The other forms are referred to the genera Arabellttes, Prioniodus,
(Hnonites, and Hnnicites. These forms have heretofore generally gone
under the name of ‘‘ Conodonts.”

James Hall (97) adds another volume to the valuable contributions
to the paleontology of New York State. This volume (VI) contains the
corals and Bryozoa [Polyzoa] from the Lower Helderberg, Upper Hel-
derberg, and Hamilton groups. There are described one hundred and
three species from the Lower Helderberg, one hundred and fifty-four
from the Upper Helderberg, and one hundred and twenty-one from the

PALEONTOLOGY. 273

_A valuable synopsis of the genera, occupying sixteen pages, has been
prepared by Charles E. Beecher. The original drawings were all made
by George B. Simpson, whose name appears on the title-page, and the
author says (p. 10) that ‘ credit is due him for the preparation of a large

part of the specific descriptions.”

Prof. Charles Barrois (10) presents a review of the above volume in
the “Annales” of the ‘‘Société Géologique du Nord.”

James Hall (98) published in 1888 another valuable contribution to
the paleontology of New York State. Although many of the species
figured have been described before, the new descriptions and diagnoses
of the species, and better illustrations than have ever appeared before,
will be of great value to the student of paleontology. One hundred
and forty-four species of Crustacea are described and illustrated, ninety-
seven of them Trilobites, the whole included under twenty-eight genera.
The author acknowledges the assistance of Mr. John M. Clarke “in the
preparation of the matter for the press and in the critical study of the
material.” A useful synopsis of genera, occupying forty-four pages, pre-
cedes the descriptive part of the work. The following new forms are

James Hall (95) publishes in the Sixth Annual Report of the State
Geologist descriptions of Fenestellide of the Hamilton group. Highteen
species were previously described, but not figured, in the Thirty-sixth
Annual Report of the New York State Museum, 1884, and are here re-
described and figured. Two new species from the Hamilton are de-
scribed, one of which is figured ; two new species are from the Waverly
of Ohio; the new species are as follows:

Fenestella albida, p. 48, pl. vii, f. 1-7, Waverly group, Richfield, Summit County,

Ohio.
Fenestelta hemicycla, p. 55, pl. vii, f. 12-16, Darien, New York, and West Will-

iams, Canada.
Fenestella aperta, p. 58, pl. iv, f. 1-5, Waverly group, Richfield, Ohio.
Fenestella spissa, p. 59 (no figure), Hamilton, West Bloomfield, New York.

Samuel G- Williams (304) contributes a paper with the title “The
Tully limestone, its distribution and its known fossils.” The author
offers a list of over a hundred species, the majority of which are com-
mon in the Hamilton shales immediately below the Tully limestone.
The indefinite notion the author has of the limits of the Tully limestone
is shown by his statement on page 20, that the estimate of the thick-
ness varies *‘ according as one includes or excludes the impure mixed
top and bottom portions.” This easily explains the length of the list
of “known” Tully species. The transition from the richly fossiliferous
fauna of the upper layers of the Hamilton to the comparatively barren
Tully limestone is so sharp that it is not safe to include even the species
found in the shale adhering to the bottom of the heavy blocks as
‘known fossils” of the Tully fauna.

C. 8. Prosser (222) read an interesting paper before the American
Association for the Advancement of Science on the Upper Hamilton of
Chenango and Otsego Counties ; the order and composition of the fau-
nas of these rocks have been carefully studied by the author.

Charles R. Keyes (135) describes the following two new fossils from
the Devonion of Iowa:

Conocardium altum, p. 26, pl. xii, f. 4a, 4b, Iowa City, Iowa.

276 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Clement L. Webster (272-276) has communicated several papers on
the Paleontology of the Devonian rocks of Northern Iowa. Unfortu-
nately he has named and published descriptions of several supposed new
species. Among the species reported (276) as known to occur in the
Rockford shale and the rocks a few feet below” are Spirifera disjuncta
Sow. and Rhynchonella venustula, Hall. Having never before heard of
the occurrence of these species in the Devonian of the interior, the
writer requested a loan of the specimens so named; the author kindly
sent specimens fop examination of the former, which proved to be not
Spirifera disjuncta, but the form which appears to be known in Iowa
under the name Spirifera Parryana, Hall, a form quite distinct from Sp.
disjuncta, although associated with it in some beds in New York. This
casts doubt upon the other identifications. The specific names pub-
lished by the author with descriptions, but without illustrations, are as
follows (all from the Rockford shales of Iowa, and all in the American
Naturalist, vol. xx1r):

Khynchonella subacuminata, p. 1015.

Athyris minutissima, p. 1015.

Paracyclas validalinea, p. 1016.

Platystoma mirus, p. 1016.

J. F. Whiteaves (291) gives a list of the fossils from the Hamilton for-

mation of Ontario, and describes the following new species :
Homocrinus crassus, p. 95, pl. 12, f. 2.
Dolatocrinus Canadensis, p. 99, pl. 12, f. 3, 3a, 3b, and 3e.

Platyostoma plicatum, p. 118, pl. 15, f. 6.

H.S. Williams (301) presents a paper in which the various types of
the Devonian system in North America are classified and defined. This
paper was read at the New York meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, August, 1887, and isa part of the “ Re-
port on the Upper Paleozoic (Devonic),” publisbed by the American
Committee of the International Congress of Geologists, and presented
to the London session in September, 1888. The author shows that the
rocks of the Devonian system present at least four types of strati-
graphical order and composition, and that the paleontological history
recorded in the four areas is distinct, both in the composition of the
faunas as a whole and in their subdivisions into separate temporary

med

PALEONTOLOGY. 21

faunas; that in different regions the same order of sequence of genera

and species in general takes place, but that for the Devonian system,
at least, the stratigraphical lines of demarkation separating one tem-

porary fauna from the next, are comparatively local and not uniform for

different regions of America.

The same author (302) gives an extended discussion, in Bulletin No. 41
of the U.S. Geological Survey, of the fossil faunas of the Upper De-
vonian of western New York. This paper is not merely a list of the
species of the Upper Devonian, but the author attempts to ascertain,

by a comparative study of the species and of the faunas of the succes-

Sive geological stages, the laws of variation or modification affecting
the species and faunas in their passage upward through the series and
in their relations to geographical distribution. Few new species are
described, but frequent reference is made to the modifications expressed
in the characters of species as they are traced upwards in the rocks
(historically), and from region to region during the same stage (geo-
graphically). These variations are also expressed by the separate tab-
ulation of the species forming the fauna of each fossiliterous zone. The
following new forms are described and figured :

Dipterus Nelsoni, Newberry, MS., p. 62, pl. iii, f. 1.

Dipterus (?) levis, Newberry, MS., p. 63, pl. iii, f. 2.

Pterinopecten (2?) Atticus, p. 35, pl. iii, f. 10, 11.

Arenicolites duplex, p. 46, pl. iv, f. 9.

Ryhnehonella Allegania, p. 87, 88, pl. iv, f. 1-8.

The name Spiraxris proposed by Professor Newberry (Ann. N.Y. Acad.
Se., vol. 111, 1885, pp. 217-220, pl. xv111,) for a peculiar screw-like fossil
occurring in the sandy deposits of the Upper Devonian, was observed
to be preoccupied by C. B. Adams, 1850, for a genus of Gasteropoda,
and the author of the above paper (302) having occasion to record the
occurrence of two species of the genus in the Wolf Creek conglomerate,
proposes the name Prospiraxis as a substitute (p. 86) for the generic
name of these peculiar fossils.

THE CARBONIFEROUS AND PERMIAN.

Charles 8S. Beachler (15, 14) contributes two short papers on the Lower
Carboniferous beds of Crawfordsville, Ind.; nothing of particular palw-
ontological interest is communicated.

i. W. Claypole (53) offers a few notes on the discovery of specimens
of Dadoxylon and other genera of fossil wood in the Carboniferous rocks
of Ohio.

C. L. Herrick (105) contributes a number of parts of a continuous
article illustrating the paleontology of Licking County, Ohio. These
278 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 18838.

are published in the Bulletin of the Denison University Laboratory of
Science, and consist of descriptions of the geology, outcrops, structure,
etc., of the Waverly rocks of Licking County, and descriptions with
figures of the forms of fossils discovered in the rocks. He has collected
a valuable series of the Waverly fossils which the illustrations help to
make familiar to scientists. He has described a large number of
new species, and an examination of the descriptions and figures leads
one to think that many of them might better have been called varieties
of already described forms, or left without specific names until more
perfect specimens were discovered and fuller comparisons made with
already described species. The following are the new species described
in volume II, 1887:

Charles R. Keyes has added three papers (134, 136, 141) to the litera-
ture of the Carboniferous. In the first, on the fauna of the Lower Coal
Measures, three new species are described :

Chonetes levis, p. [8] 229, pl. xii, f. 3, a, b.
Pleurotomaria modesta, p. [17] 238, pl. xii, f. 2, a, b.
Macrocheilus humilis, p. [13] 239, pl. xii, f. 1.

F. A. Sampson (229) describes the Subcarboniferous series at Se-
dalia, Missouri, and Lieut. A. W. Vodges (251) describes two new spe-
cies from the same :

Phillipsia sampsoni, pp. 248, 249, and two wood-cuts, p. 249.
Griffithides (2) sedaliensis, p. 249.

In another paper (250) Lieutenant Vodges reviews the genera and
species of North American Trilobites; the following four gencra are
recognized: Proetus, Steininger; Phillipsia, Portlock; Griffithides,
Portlock, and Brachymetopsis, McCoy. The author gives a diagnosis
of each genus and discusses the various species and synonymy, with
their distribution in North America. The original description of the
species is given in many cases, with a careful specific diagnosis for each
species. Six speciesof Proetus, twelve species of Phillipsia, five species
of Griffithides, and one species of Brachymetopsis are recognized. The
generic characters are illustrated in the plates. ;

THE MESOZOIC.

William B. Clark (27) finds evidence in the fossils discovered in Anne
Arundel and Prince George Counties, Maryland, to establish the per-
sistence of the Cretaceous strata across the State, from the Delaware
line on the northeast to the Potomac River on the southwest, and lists
of the’species with localities are given. The same author (24) remarks
upon the discovery of an Arcestes (nu. sp.), Arcestes rhaticus, p. 119,
figured in a former paper (25), in the Rhetie beds of the northern
Tyrol. This is taken as evidence for regarding the Rhietic as more
closely allied with the Trias than with the Lias. The same author (26)
presents lists of species collected from several localities in the southern
counties of Maryland, representing the Eocene and Miocene faunas ;
no new species are described.

R. T. Hill has published three papers (108, 109, 110) of considerable
value in expounding the knowledge of the geology of Texas, particu-
larly of the Cretaceous system. The paper (110) on the Geology of
the Cross-timbers contains a table (pp. 298-299) of a geological section
of the Cretaceous across the State of Texas, in which are indicated the
characteristic fossils of each zone. In another paper (109), on the
282 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Texas section of the American Cretaceous, the author gives lists—of
fossils of the upper division of the Texas Cretaceous (pp. 294, 295),
of the middle division of the Texas Cretaceous (pp. 297, 299), of the
upper or Washita division of the Lower Cretaceous (pp. 302, 303), of the
Fredericksburgh division (p. 305), The author notes the fact of an ap-
parent continuity of interlocking faunas throughout the series, but
with the exception of Gryphea pitcheri, Mort., not a single species is
known to pass from the Comanche series into the upper formations.
He further observes that the fauna of the Comanche series presents
closer resemblance to those of Europe and tropical America than to
other Cretaceous faunas of the United States.

Mr. W J McGee (177-178) contributes two papers, mainly strati-
graphical and structural, on the formations of the Middle Atlantic
slope; no extended paleontological facts are given, but the author
mentions occasionally the species characteristic of the formations. .

Eugene A. Smith, in conjunction with Lawrence C. Johnson (241),
published a valuable contribution to the knowledge of the Tertiary and
Cretaceous strata of Alabama. The bulletin deals mainly with geolog-
ical facts, but there is frequent reference to the species of fossils char-
acterizing the strata discussed. |

C. A. White (278), commenting upon the age of the coal found in the
region traversed by the Rio Grande, refers it to the age of the Laramie
or Fox Hill formations. The same author (282) describes three new
genera and three new species from the Cretaceous, which are as follows:

(Crassitellide),

Stearnsia (gen. nov.), p. 32, with, as type, S. Robinsi (n. sp.), p. 33, pl. ii, f. 7-9.

(Aviculide),

Dalliconcha (gen. nov.), p. 34, with, as types, the following species: D. invagt-
nata (n. sp.), p. 35, pl. il, f. 4, 5, and Gervillia ensformis.

Aquilaria (gen. nov.), p. 35, with, as type, 4. Cumminsi (n. sp.), 37, pl. ii, f. 1-3.

C. A. White (283) gives an account of the results of examinations of
the Texas Cretaceous, with R. T. Hill as field assistant. The fossils
have not been fully studied, but enough is done to make clear the rela-
tions of the various deposits to those of other sections. The Comanche
series are older than any Cretaceous deposits exhibited in any other
American section. A complete faunal break occurs at the top of the
Comanche. The upper series may be satisfactorily correlated with
Cretaceous formations of western and upper Missouri.

C. A. White (285) has published a number of new species from South
America, which, though not strictly appropriate to a list of North
American Paleontology, are compared with American species. The
author has 3 new genera and 158 new species, divided as follows: Con-
chifera, 58; Gasteropoda, 73; Polyzoa, 1; Cephalopoda, 9; Fresh-water
Mollusca, 5; Echinodermata, 12. The same author (288) reports on the
fossils from Hardin County, lowa. These were examined by the author
and found to possess close affinities with the Mollusca fauna of the Fox
PALEONTOLOGY. : 283

Hills group. Two of them are identical with Fox Hills species. is-
podesthes (?) haworthi (n. sp.) is deseribed and figured (pp. 224-225),
Another paper (287) discusses the Puget group of Washington Terri-
tory. Twelve species are recognized from these rocks, eight of which
are regarded as new, and are named but not described.

They are—

Cyrena brevidens. B. dubia.

Corbicula Willisi. Psammobia obscura.

C. Pugetensis. Sanguinolaria (?) caudata.
Batissa Newberryi. Teredo Pugetensis.

Study of the fossils leads the author to agree with J. 8S. Newberry
and Bailey Willis as to the equivalency and probable contemporaneity
of the Puget group with the Laramie. In another paper (286) Mr.
White discusses the relation of the Laramie group to other and later
formations and considers the greater part of the Laramie as of Creta-
ceous age, the upper strata representing a gradual transition from the
Cretaceous to the Tertiary period.

J. F. Whiteaves (292, 294, 295) contributes three papers on the Pa-
leontology of the Mesozoic.

The first (295), on some fossils from the Cretaceous and Laramie
rocks of the Saskatchewan, is an appendix to Mr. J. B. Tyrrell’s report,
and the following new species are described:

Cyprina subtrapeziformis, p. 155e.
Solecurtus (Tagelus) occidentalis, p. 157e.
Marteria tumidifrons, pp. 157e-158e.
Hydatina parvula, pp. 158e-159e.
Paleastacus (?) ornatus, pp. 161e-162e.

In the second paper (294), which is an appendix to G. M. Dawson’s
report, some Mesozoic fossils from British Columbia are described.
The new species are as follows:

Aulacoceras Charlottense, p. 109b, Triassic.
Celtites (2?) Vancouverensis, p. 110b, Triassic.
Placenticeras occidentale, p. 113b, Cretaceous.

R. P. Whitfield (297, 299) remarks upon the fossils of the New Jersey
Cretaceous. In the article in the American Naturalist (299) a synopsis
of the number of species in each zone of the Cretaceous rocks of New
Jersey is given, and also an account of the number of New Jersey
species occurring in the corresponding beds of other States.

THE CENOZOIC.

Aug. Heilprin (102) discusses the classification of the Post-Cretace-
ous department. This is mainly a geological paper, but the author
makes some timely remarks upon the value of faunas for determining
chronology. He says: ‘The absolute succession of equivalent faunas,
or faunas of a practically identical facies, which has been demonstrated
for the greater part of the world, clearly establishes the claims of the
faunal element as the guide propre in the determination of chronology.”
In another paper (103) Mr. Heilprin presents additional lists of species
of Miocene Mollusca of New Jersey, and the following new species are
described:

Murex Slilohensis, p. 404, no figure.

Pleurotoma pseudeburnea, p. 404, no figure.

Triforis terebrata, p. 405, no figure.

Pecten Humphreysii, var. Woolmani (new var.), p. 405.

Otto Meyer has produced several papers during the two years (182,
183, 184, 185,186,187). In the paper (183) on the “Invertebrates from the
Eocene of Mississippi and Alabma,” the following new species are de-
scribed:

Odostomia Boettgeri, p. 51, pl. iii, f. 4.

Turbonilla major, p. 51, pl. iii, f. 3.

culum. The uames of a few additional Foraminifera of the Eocene of
Mississippi and Alabama are given on p.65. In the paper on the Mio-
cene invertebrates from Virginia (185) the author presents a list of the
smaller Mollusea identified in the sand adhering to the larger species,
collected from the Miocene beds near Yorktown. The following new
species are described :

Caecum stevensoni, p. 139, f 4.
Cacum virginianum, p. 139, f. 3.
Pyramis promilium, p. 140, f. 1.

Astarte orbicularior, p. 141, f. 6.
Semele (?) virginiana, p. 143, f. 10.
PALEONTOLOGY. 285

.In the paper (186) on the “Upper Tertiary Invertebrates from the
west side of Chesapeake Bay,” the author gives a list of twenty-five
species discovered inside a large Lbalanus concavus Bronn; one new
species is described: Aligena sharpi, sp. nov., p. 171, and wood cut. In
the article (187) on the two books of Conrad on Tertiary shells, the
author gives information in regard to imperfections which have ap-
peared in various copies of T. A. Conrad’s * Fossil Shells of the Tertiary
Formations,” and “ Fossils of the Tertiary Formations.”

C. L. Webster (272) has written an article on the geology of Johnson
County, at the close of which, p. 419, is given a list of eighteen species
of land and fresh-water shells, collected from the Loess of Johnson
County by Prof. B. Shimek, of lowa City, five of which are said not to
occur as living forms in the county at the present time.

B. Shimek (239) publishes notes on the fossils of the Loess at Iowa
City; a list of twenty-five species is given with comments, but no
species are described.

k. Ellsworth Call (19) defines a new Post-Pliocene Limnzid, refer-
ring it to the genus Pompholyx, Lea, and describing it under the name
Pompholopsis whitei (subgen. et sp. nov.), p. 147, f. 1-3, from Tassajara
Hillis, California. Comparison is made of this genus with the genera
Carinifex, Binney, Pompholyx, Lea, and Vorticifexr, Meek.

T. H. Aldrich (1), in a paper in the Journal of the Cincinnati Society
of Natural Science (vol. x, pp. 78-83), describes the following new

William H. Dall (58) publishes some interesting notes on the Geol-
ogy of Florida, giving accounts of the results of explorations undertaken
by instruction of the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1885
and 1887. The paper discusses the geological structure and _ strati-
graphical sequence of deposits, and the author refers casually to the
occurrence of species of fossils in the deposits studied. ‘ In referring
to the age of the deposits,” he says, ‘while the old terms Miocene,
Pliocene, etc., may be used for the sake of convenience, it must be
clearly understood that, as at present defined, they are only of relative
value and indicative at most of stratigraphical succession in a very
limited sense. As determined by their invertebrate fauna, the Plio-
cene, for instance, of South Europe, is probably older than the strata
called Pliocene in America; at all events it is highly improbable that
they represent synchronous geological epochs. The method of determ-
ining which name should be used for a particular division of the Tertiary,
by taking percentages of the supposed extinct species, is, on the face
of it, impracticable, illogical, and misleading. Our knowledge of the
Tertiary in America is still so fragmentary and imperfect as to render
a synchronic subdivision. of all the Post-Cretaceous strata impossible
for the present.”

L. C. Johnson (132) speaks upon the structure of Florida. Several
fossils are identified, indicating Eocene age for the underlying rock (of
the Vicksburg group); this is covered in places by the ‘“ Nummulitic
limestone,” and upon this rest the Miocene and more recent rocks.

J. G. Cooper (35, 36) has published lists of California shells in the
Proceedings and Bulletins of the California Academy of Science, and
the Annual Report of the State Mineralogist of California.

Lester F. Ward (269) presents the evidence as to the age of the Poto-
mae formation derived from the study of the work of Professor Fon-
taine upon this remarkable flora. He tabulates the species, comparing
them with those known and described from other deposits whose geo-
logical position is well known, and “from this exhibit it appears that
no Jurassic species occurs in the Potomac formation, although it con-
288 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

tains a large number of strongly Jurassic types. The Wealden fur-
nished the largest number of identical species, the Cenomanian next,
and the Urgonian next. Of allied species, although the largest num-
ber occurs in the Oolite, the Cenomanian, Urgonian, and Wealden each
furnish many. Taking the identical species, and considering the Weal-
den as Cretaceous, the flora would appear to be decidedly Cretace-
ous, but if this showing is considered in the light the Jurassic types
cast upon it, it is difficult to believe it to be higher than Wealden or
Neocomian.” But he says at the close that in case the stratigraphical
and animal remains should require such reference, ‘“‘the plants do not
present any serious obstacle to reference of the Potomac formation to
the Jurassic.”

C. A. White (280) publishes a very interesting article on the inter-
relation of contemporaneous fossil faunas and floras, an addition to the
literature already contributed by him in this line. The present paper
considers the relationship between the invertebrate faunas and floras
and the vertebrate faunas preserved in the range of deposits from the
Laramie group to the Bridger, inclusive. He considers that sedimenta-
tion was continuous during the whole time, and that there was for the
whole time, and within the region where the Laramie and Bridger de-
posits were being made, an unbroken continuity of invertebrate and
plant life. “If these conditions actually existed we must necessarily
conclude that the Puerco and Wasatch mammalian faunas were both
suddenly and independently introduced into the region where they are
now found from some other region where they previously existed,” and
he concludes that “the Wasatch fauna existed somewhere contempora:
neously with the Puerco mammalia from which it differs so much, and also
contemporaneously with the Laramie dinosaurs, from which it differs far
more widely.” In the latter part of the paper the author presents rea-
sons for considering it necessary to study the history of continental and
fresh-water faunas and floras distinctly from the marine faunas, and
that until evidence is obtained positively identifying faunas of the two
types of deposits, they should be classified separately.

The same author (289) in a note to the editors of the American Nat-
uralist announces that he has found that Mr. Cummins was entirely
correct in his reported discovery of Mesozoic and Paleozoic types of in-
vertebrates commingled in one and the same layer of the Permian. The
deposits in which this discovery was made are in Baylor, Archer, and
Wichita Counties, Texas.

Three papers by J. W. Dawson (62, 63, 70), although not of a pale-
ontological nature, are of interest to paleontologists. The author com-
pares the Eozoic and Paleozoic deposits of eastern North America with
the European series of deposits, and also with those of the Arctic basin.
He finds the geological series up to the Trias-Juras, and after an inter-
val again in the Quaternary, to be closely related on the borders of the
Atlantic on both sides, and far northward into the Artic regions, and
PALEONTOLOGY. 289

the series of deposits of the maritime provinces of eastern North Amer-
ica much more closely corresponding with those of western Europe than
with those of the interior of the American continent.

PROTOZOA AND SPONGES.

Sir William Dawson and George Jennings Hinde (72) describe some
new species of fossil sponges trom Little Métis, Province of Quebec
Canada. The following new species are proposed:

Protospongia tetranema, Dawson, p. 52-53, f. 1, and further described and dis-
cussed by Hinde, pp. 63-65.

Hyalostelia metissica, Dawson, p. 54, and Hinde’s comments, p. 65.

Cyathophycus quebecensi:, Dawson, p. 54, Hinde’s comments, pp. 65-67.

Buthotrephis pergracilis, Dawson, p. 5d.

G. J. Hinde (114) discusses the spicules and structure of Archwocya-
thus minganensis. The author concludes that the sponge spicules found
in association with this fossil are not part of its structure, and that the
so-called “branching spicula” are siliceous replacements of the tissue
of its outer wall; but he does not conclude that the Archwocyathus is
allied to the siliceous sponges. He is of the opinion that the fossil was
originally caleareous.

C. D. Walcott (259) explains and defends his reference of Archwocya-
thus profundus of Billings to Meek’s genus Ethmophyllum, as proposed
in his recent publication, Thirtieth Bulletin of the U. 8S. Geological
Survey.

Joseph F. James (123) discusses the Protozoa of the Cincinnati group.

George J. Hinde (111) considers the species Hindia fibrosa of Roemer
to be identical with Astylospongia tnornata, Hall, 1833, and that the
genera Hindia and Astylospongia are closely allied.

P. M. Duncan (74) makes a critical reply defending his establishment
of the genus Hindia, claiming that Roemer was ignorant of the char-
acters which indicate the relationship of his species to the sponges.

Anthony Woodward (307) published a supplement to his ‘ Bibli-
ography of the Foraminifera” (Fourteenth Annual Report of the Geo-
logical Survey of Minnesota, pages 167-311) in the Journal of the New
York Microscopical Society, January, 1888. The imperfections of this
work called forth the severe criticism of Mr. Charles D. Sherborn (Na-
ture, vol. 37, pp. 583-584, 1888), who published in London an exhaustive
treatise (238) on the ‘‘ Bibliography of the Foraminifera, recent and fos-
sil, from 1565 to 1888.”

James Hall (94) gives some interesting statistics in regard to the
Dictyospongide. They are recorded as ranging geologically from the
Utica slate to the Sub-carboniferous, and geographically are reported
from the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. A
list of forty species is given and a map of Steuben County on which are
marked the localities where Dictyophyton has been found.

290 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Hozoon canadense has received some attention during the two years
under consideration. Sir William Dawson (66, 69) has brought the dis-
cussion of the nature of Hozoon canadense up to the present time. In
the paper (69), issued by the Peter Redpath Museum of MeGill Uni-
versity, the author presents an exhaustive review of the characters of
Hozoon, discusses the objections to its animal nature, and gives (on p.
91) asummary of the arguments in support of the animal nature of
Hozoon canadense, the chief points of which are as follows:

‘1. It occurs in masses in limestone rocks, just as Stromatopore oc-
cur in the Paleozoic limestone.

“2, While sometimes in confluent and shapeless sheets or masses,
it is, when in small or limited individuals, found to assume a regular
rounded, cylindrical or more frequently broadly turbinate form.

‘¢3. Microscopically it presents a regular lamination, the lamin
being confluent at intervals so as to form a network in the transverse
section. The lamine have tuberculated surfaces or casts of such tu-
berculated surfaces, giving an acervuline appearance to those lamine
which are supposed to be the casts of chambers.

“4, The original calcareous lamin are traversed by systems of
branching canals, now filled with various mineral substances, and in
some places coarse and in many others becoming a fine tubulated wall.
The typical form of these canals is cylindrical, but they are often flat-
tened, especially in the larger stems.

‘5, In some specimens, large vertical tubes or oscula may be seen to
penetrate the mass.

“6. On the sides of such tubes, and on the external surface the lam-
inz subdivide and become confluent, thus forming a species of porous
epidermal layer or theca.

“7, Fragments of Hozoon are found forming layers in the limestone,
showing that it was being broken up when the limestones were in pro-
cess of deposition.

“8. The great extent and regularity of the limestones show that they
were of marine origin, and they contain graphite, apatite, and obscure
organic (?) fragments other than Hozoon.

“9. The ordinary specimens of Hozoon are mineralized with hydrous
silicates (serpentine, etc.) in the same manner with Silurian and other
specimens filled with glauconite, ete. These hydrous silicates also oc-
cur in the same limestones in concretions, bands, ete., in such a manner
as to prove that they were deposited contemporaneously.

‘10, In some cases the canals and chamberlets are filled with cal-
cite.and dolomite, in the manner of ordinary calcareous fossils, and this
filling can often-be distinguished from the original caleareous wall by a
minutely granular or porous structure in the latter.

611. The specimens of Hozoon have been folded and faulted with the
containing limestones, showing that they are not products of any sub-
sequent segregation.
PALEONTOLOGY. 291

_ “12. Similar testimony is borne in the fact that the masses of Hozoon
are crossed by the veins of chrysotile which traverse the limestones
and are of later origin.

“13. The whole of the forms and struetures seen in Hozoon corre-
spond with those to be expected in a gigantic and highly generalized
Rhizopod secreting a calcareous test, and possessing, as might be anti-
cipated in such early organism, structures in some degree allied to such
later forms as Stromatopore and calcareous sponges, which in the
Eozoie it functionally represented.”

_ This book will be of great value to students of paleontology, espe-
cially to those connected with the universities and called upon to dis-
cuss the order of the appearance of life in the Geological Series. Sir
William Dawson, who has championed the organic nature of Hozoon
for so many years, finds no reason to change his views, although very
able antagonists have presented the arguments against its organic
nature.

Dr. Selwyn, the director of the Canada Survey (235) refers to Sir
William Dawson’s paper in the Geological Magazine (66), and expresses
his dissent from the views expressed by the author ‘in correlating
any of the so-called Upper Laurentian Anorthosites of the vicinity of
St. Jerome or elsewhere with the Huronian rocks west of Lake Supe-
rior.” The massive Anorthosites he continues to regard as clearly in-
trusive, and that the so-called Norian or Upper Laurentian formation
has, as such, no existence in Canada.

L. P. Gratacap (92) has recorded his recognition of Eozoonal rock on
Manhattan Island.

CORALS.

P. M. Duncan (75) describes a new genus of Madreporaria under the
name of Glyphastrea, of which the type species is Septastrea Forbesi,
Edwards and Haime, from the Tertiary deposits of Maryland. He gives
an amended description of the species, pages 29, 30, with figures illus-
trating it, plate iil, figs 1-16.

G. J. Hinde (112) presents a minute and exhaustive study of the
distinguishing characters and nomenclature of the genus Septastrea,
D’Orb., revises the generic definition, gives a iist of the species with
notes upon their characters, and in a plate illustrates them. He criti-
cises the previously-mentioned paper of Dunean’s and considers the
original species Septastrwa Forbesi, Edw. and H., which was used as
the type of Duncan’s genus Glyphastrea to be generically identical with
the type species of D’Orbigny’s genus Septastraa.

C. A. White (290) describes a new genus, Hindeastrea (page 362)
of which the type species is a new species, H. discoiaea, page 363, figs.
1,2, 3, 4, 5, from the Ripley group (Cretaceous) of Kaufman County,

Miss Mary EH. Holmes (116) has prepared a paper beautifully illus-
trating the “morphology of the carine upon the septa of rugose corals,”
presented as a thesis for the degree of doctor of philosophy in the Uni-
versity of Michigan. A short notice of this paper is given inthe Amer-
ican Geologist, vol. I, p. 61. I have seen the drawings, but have not
read the paper.

CRINOICS.

Wachsmuth and Springer (252) publish part 111, the final number, of
their Revision of the Paleocrinoidea. This consists of section 2, pp.
139-334, and an index, pp. 303-334, which, I understand, was not pub-
lished in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science. Although
section 2 of part If was presented to the Academy in 1886, it was not
published until 1887. This completes the grand work in which is given
a thorough diagnosis of each genus with citation of the known species,
and full bibliographic references for the Palecrinoidea.

Part I11 is devoted to the discussion of the classification and rela-
tions of the Brachiate Crinoids, and the conclusion of the generic de-
scriptions. The following new genera and species are described :

Stenocrinus (syn. Heterocrinus in part), p. 207, type ‘‘ Heterocrinus helerodac-
tylus,” Hall, 1843.

Ohiocrinus (Heterocrinus, Hall, in part), p. 208 (Heterocrinus laxus, Hall, type
of the genus).

Atelestocrinus, p. 221, pl. 6, f. 4, and pl. 9, f. 4, Low. Carb., Iowa.

Atelestocrinus delicatus, p. 223, Low. Carb., Lowa.

Atelestocrinus robustus, p. 223, pl. 9, f: 4, Low. Carb., Iowa and Tennessee.

Zeacrinus nodosus, p. 243, pl. 6, f. 3, Low. Carb., Tennessee.

Stemmatocrinus Trautscholdi, p. 256, pl. 9, f. 7, 8, Low. Carb., Tennessee.

C. A. White (279) gives a review of this book. The same authors,
Wachsmuth and Springer (253), diseuss the Summit plates in Blas-
toids, Crinoids, and Cystids. (This paper is reviewed by C. A. White,
281.) This paper consists of a review and criticism of the opinions of
Etheridge and Carpenter as expressed in the “ Catalogue of the Blas-
toidea in the Geological department of the British Museum (Nat.
Hist.), with an account of the morphology and systematic position of
the group, and a revision of the genera and species. By Robert Eth-
eridge and P. Herbert Carpenter. Quarto. Pages i-xvii, and 1-322,20
plates, London, 1886.” The part discussed is found, particularly, in
chapter Iv, pages 66-74 inclusive. Messrs. Wachsmuth and Springer
have prepared plates which accompany the paper illustrating the ven-
tral aspects of species of the following genera: Spheronites, Cyathoert-
nus, Stephanocrinus, Haplocrinus, Caryocrinus, Juglandocrinus, Talaroert-
nus, Elecrinus. In another paper (255) the same authors discuss the
characters of Crotalocrinus, and in (254) the structure of the ventral
surface of Vaxocrinus.

S. A. Miller (188) names and defines the new genus, Siphonocrinus,
page 263, adopting as the type species Glyptocrinus nobilis, Hall (20th
PALEONTOLOGY. 293

Report N. Y. Mus. Nat. Hist., p. 362, pl. x, f. 9, 10). The author refers
to the same genus the species Eapahanenes armosus, McChesney
(= Glyptocrinus armosus, Hall).

The late U. P. James (131) published a reprint of the description of
Agelacrinus Holbrooki, U. P. James, page 25, with a figure.

W. R. Billings (16) published the following new genus and species
from the Trenton formation of Ottawa and neighborhood: Ottavwacri-
nus, gen. nov., and OQ. typus, sp. nov., p. 49, Calceocrinus furcillatus, sp.
nov., p. 51, C. rugosus, sp. NOV., p. 93.

THE MOLLUSCOIDA.

A few papers have been written on the Polyzoa and Brachiopods
which do not fall into any of the other divisions of this report.

C. Rominger (227) describes a new form of Bryozoa from the drift of
Ann Arbor, Michigan, under the name of Patellapora stellata, sp. nov.,
red WG 0) Pa ea pe a8

Joseph F, James has a short note (125) on the value of the internal
sections of corals when used for specific characters, considering them
to be of small value because of the great variation they show, and of
the different forms presented according to the relation of the plane of
the section to the individual cells.

A.F. Foerste (82) and E. O Ulrich (249) reply to Mr. James’s criticism,
defending the methods in use by Mr. Ulrich and Mr. Ford.

J. F. James (128) presents a paper “ on the Monticulipora a coral, not
a Polyzoan.” He had already published an elaborate review of the
Trenton Monticuliporoide (130). In the present paper the author re-
views the characters of the family Monticulporoidze of Nicholson, in-
cluding the genera Monticulipora and Ceramopora, and defends the view
of Nicholson in placing them among the Coelenterata near the Helio-
poridz, as opposed to the classification of E. O. Ulrich, who classes them
with the Polyzoa, ‘‘ Bryozoa.”

H. A. Nicholson (202) writes on certain anomalous organisms which
are concerned in the formation of the Paleozoic limestones. In the
course of the paper he defines them under the names Mitcheldeania gre-
garia, 0. sp., p. 16, f. 1, 2, and Solenopora filiformis, n. sp., p. 21, f. 4.

The characters of the genus Girvanella, Nicholsonand Etheridge, 1830,
are also discussed, and comparisons are made with related American
forms. In another paper (201) Professor Nicholson comments upon
new or imperfectly known species of Stromatoporids. No new species
are described, but some American species are figured with descriptions
and notes upon their characters. ;

EB. O. Ulrich (248) discusses the genus Sceptropora with remarks upon
Helopora, Hall. The author describes and figures a new genus and
species of Lower Silurian Polyzoan, under the name Sceptropora facula,
gen. et sp. nov., pp. 228,229, obtained from Manitoba, and also from
two localities in Illinois. He considers the systematic position of the
294 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888

new genus as near that of the genus Helopora in the family Arthro-
stylide (Ulrich). This family name is based upon the new generic name
Arthrostylus, which, in a foot-note, the author erects in place of Arthro-
nema, Ulrich, which he finds preoccupied. Illustrations are given of
the internal characters of Helopora, also of the characters of the family
to which it belongs.

James Hall (93), at the end of the forty-first report of the Trustees of
the New York State Museum of Natural History, published Tectulipora
nov. subgen., Fenestella (Tectulipora) loculata, n. sp., and Fenestella
frequens, 1 Sp., pl. ix, f. 12-15. The pages are not numbered, but as
bound would be 496 for all but the last, which is 497. On pl. x the
figures 14,15 are called in explanation of plate ‘ Fenestella nevilis, n.
sp.”, and on pl. xiv, figures 10-12 are called Fenestella varia, n. sp.”

Norman Glass (90) has written a paper on the principal modifications
of the spirals in the fossil Brachiopoda. The author notes the position
of the spirals in the shell, comments upon the attachments of the spi-
rals to the hinge-plate of the dorsal valve, and on the loop or the con-
nection of the spirals with each other in the various genera of spiral-
bearing Brachiopoda.

H.8S. Williams (300) discusses the characters of the representatives
of the family Strophomenidée at its first prominent appearance in the
Trenton. He analyzes the characters and shows their relationship to
each other. The characters which became at a later stage generic dif-
ferentia were found in a plastic state at the first stage. The specific
differentia expressed throughout the life history of the family appeared
to be more plastic in the early than in the later species. In the later
stages of the history of the family the specific characters are more
sharply accentuated, but except in this way they scarcely exceed in
variety those appearing at the first stage of existence of the family.

THE GASTEROPODA.

Charles R. Keyes has written several papers (137, 138, 139, 140) in
regard to Platyceras and its relations to the Crinoids upon which it is
found attached. In one of the papers (138) four new species of Platy-
ceras are described and figured from the Lower Carboniferous beds of
Iowa. They are as follows:

Platyceras capax, p. 241, f. 14, 15.
Platyceras obliquum, p. 241, f. 12, 13.
Platyceras latum, p. 242, f.10, 11.
Platyceras formosum, p. 242, f. 8, 9.

In the other three papers the author gives an interesting account of
the mode of attachment of Platyceras to the dome of Crinoids. The asso-
ciation of the front part of the shell with the anal opening suggests the
probability that the Gasteropod lived upon the exereta of the Crinoid.
The attachment appears to have continued long, and probably during
the life of the Platyceras, and this is regarded as sufficient explanation
PALEONTOLOGY. 295

for the considerable variation of the Gasteropod in its “ general form,
configuration of the aperture, and the surface markings.” In spite of
the clear recognition of this plasticity of form the author has been una-
ble to resist the temptation to name and define in terms of these plastic
characters the four new species above mentioned.

THE CEPHALOPODA.

Alpheus Hyatt (121) has presented a valuable paper, strictly biological,
in which he discusses the value of embryological characters in the defini-
tion and classification of the Cephalopoda. He proposes a new nomen-
clature for the stages of development of the embryo, and applies the
classification in distinguishing the various stages represented by the
fossil Cephalopoda. In a brief review it is impossible to give the sub-
stance of this paper, and those interested are referred to the article
itself, which is fully as interesting as the important works on similar
subjects which Professor Hyatt has already published. Professor Hyatt
also read a paper before the National Academy, at the Boston meeting,
on the primitive forms of Cephalopods (119), an abstract of which is
given in the American Naturalist, as above cited. It is difficult to ex-
press in briefer words the contents of this valuable paper. The author
discusses the phylogenetic relations of the Paleozoic and later Cepha-
lopods, particularly in respect to their characters of curving, from the
straight coiled form, as seen in Orthoceras, to the close coiled Nautilian
form.

In the report of Contributions to Canadian Paleontology, by Pro-
fessor Whiteaves (292), two generic descriptions are communicated by
Professor Hyatt (120) from the Triassic rocks of British Columbia. The
names are—

Arniotites, Hyatt, gen. nov., p. 144, type Balatonites arietiformis, Mojsisovics.
Dorikranites, Hyatt, gen. nov., p. 145, type Balatonites Bagdoanus, Mojsisovics.

Arthur H. Foord (86) publishes a note on the genus Actinoceras with
particular reference to specimens in the British Museum showing the
perforated apex of the Siphuncle; the specimens illustrated are from
the Trenton and Black River rocks of the United States, British North
America, and Arctic America. The same author (87) writes on the
genus Piloceras Salter, as elucidated by examples lately discovered in
North America and Scotland. The bibliography of the genus is re-
ferred to, the internal structure is described and illustrated, and the
characters discussed, based upon study of Scotch and American speci-

A. S. Packard published in 1887 several memoirs which were read
before the National Academy of Sciences in 1885, and their contents
have already been reported in the scientific journals.

The first (218a) “On the Synearida, a hitherto undescribed synthetie
groupof extinct Malacostracous Crustacea” (vol. LIL, pp. 125-128, and two
296 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

plates) discusses the characters of the species Acanthotelson stimpsona,
Meek and Worthen, and A. event, M.and W. Some new facts in regard
to them have come to light through the study of additional specimens
from the collections of R. D. Lacoe and J.C. Carr. The author defines
one new species from Mazon Creek, Acanthotelson (?) magister, p. 127,
pl. ii, f. 4, 5. In a foot-note (p. 128) some new characters, observed on
a larger specimen from Brainwood, Illinois, are made the basis of a
brief definition of and the proposal of a new generic name, Belotelson
(the entire name Belotelson magister), for the species.

In the second paper (218)) ** On the Gampsonychide, an undescribed
family of fossil Schizopod Crustacea ” (pp. 129-133, pl. iii), the study of
specimens of Palwocaris typus, Meek and Worthen, has induced the
author to compare them with the genus Gampsonyz, “and the result
has led to the formation of a family or higher group for the genera,
which should probably stand at the base of the Schizopoda, while also
serving to bridge over the chasm existing between the Thoracostracous
suborders Syncarida and Schizopoda.”

In the third paper (218c) ‘On the Anthracaride, a family of Carbon-
iferous Macrurous Decapod Crustacea,” pp. 134-139, pl. iv, the author
presents new facts regarding the species Anthrapalemon gracilis, Meek
and Worthen, from study of which and comparison with other forms he
erects for it and kindred forms the family Anthracaride.

A fourth paper (218d) is ‘On the Carboniferous Xiphosurous fauna
of North America,” pp. 143-157, pls. v, vi, vii. This paper defines and
figures Cyclus Americana Packard, Dipeltis diplodiscus Packard, Prest-
wichia dane, Meek, Prestwichia longispina Packard, and Belinurus lacoet
Packard. In a note on the validity of the genus Huprodps, the author ex-
presses the opinion “ that the apparent differences between Prestwichia
and Huproéps, as stated by Messrs. Meek and Worthen, did not exist
in nature.” Ina foot-note, p. 150, the author discusses the characters
of Prestwichia eriensis Williams, and presents reasons for the opinion
that the species is not a Prestwichia, and for it he proposes the name
and briefly defines the new genus Protolimulus. A synopsis of North
American Xiphosura is given, p. 150; the name Synziphosura is pro-
posed for the suborder, including Bunodida Packard, Hemiaspide Zittel
(restricted), Pseudoniscidew Packard, and Neolimulide Packard.

The term Podostoma is proposed on page 156 for the class which in-
cludes the two orders (1) Merostomata, with the suborders Xiphosura,
Synziphosura, and Hurypterida, and (11) Trilobita.

The two articles recorded under the same author’s name (218e, 220)
are reviews of the monographs above discussed. The first one (218e)
is an abstract prepared by the author on the class Podostomata, and
contains the substance of the latter part of the fourth paper above re-
ferred to (218d). The article (220) on Fossil Arthropods, in the Ameri-
can Naturalist, is a brief notice by the editor of the four papers just
mentioned.

- 8. H. Seudder (233) communicates a brief note on Dr. Woodward’s
paper in the Geological Magazine, “On British Carboniferous Cock-
roaches.”

J.M. Clarke (31) has published in the Journal of Morphology a beauti-
ful and exhaustive memoir on the eyes of the common Devonian Trilo-
bite, Phacops rana Green. He discusses the subject under the follow-
ing sections: ‘* The character of the visual area;” “The composition of
the visual node,” showing the arrangement of the lenses; ‘‘ The struc-
ture of the lens ;” “The multiplication and diminution in the number of
lenses ;” “The development of the lens ;” “ The structure of the sclera;”
“The modes of preservation of the visual surface.”

August F. Foerste (83a) communicates some notes on the discovery
of two new species in the Trenton limestone of Minnesota. Thesespecies
are Illenus (Nileus) minnesotensis sp. nov., p. 478, f. 1, and I[llanus Her-
ricki, sp. nov., p. 497, f. 2, the latter of which he compares with Illwnus
pterocephalus W hitfield, of the Niagara strata of Wisconsin. Figureand
description are also given of Jllenus ambiguus Foerste, from the Niagara
group of Pennsylvania.

E. G. Chapman (23) publishes a short paper on the classification of
Trilobites.

EK. N. S. Ringueberg (224) read a paper on a Trilobite track which
presents the ten pairs of impressions of the feet in groups, separate from
each other, from which he concludes that the mode of progression was
by a series of jumps.

VERTEBRATA.

G. F. Matthew (166, 168) describes an interesting fish from the Silu-
rian at Nerepis Hills, King’s County, New Brunswick, under the name
Diplaspis Acadica, (gen. et sp. nov.) page 69 (of No. 166), and this
species he regards as allied to Pteraspis, but distinct. The species was
originally described as Pteraspis (2?) Acadica by the author, in the Ca-
nadian Record of Science, 1886, pages 251,252 and 323-325, and was
taken from shales considered to be of an Upper Silurian age.

J. S. Newberry (199) discusses the characters of the genus Hdestus,
and describes the jaw of a gigantic species called Edestus gigunteus (sp.
nov.), page 121, plate vi., f. 1. The paper by Miss Hitchcock (115) is a
discussion of the relations of this genus. Professor Newberry has also
published several papers on fossil fishes from the Devonian and Carbo-
niferous (191, 194, 195, 197, and 198). In the paper on Titanichthys (195)
a general description of the bones is given, illustrated with diagrams
and drawings (which are not reproduced in the paper), and the name
Titanichthys Clarkii (sp. nov.) was given to the species in honor of the
discoverer, Dr. William Clark. The note in the American Geologist
by E. W. Claypole (34) refers to this same specimen. In the paper
(198), which is but an abstract, Professor Newberry describes briefly and
298 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

gives the names of the following new species and genus: Cladoaus Kep-
leri, pp. 173,179; Actinophorus (gen. nov.) p. 179; A. Clarkii, p. 179;
Dinichthys curtus, p. 179; D. tuberculatus, p. 179. In the paper (197) a
new species is briefly noticed under the name Rhizodus anceps, p. 165,
discovered by William McAdams in the St. Louis limestone at Alton,
Illinois.

A paper was read by J. F. Whiteaves (293) in May, 1888, before the
Royal Society of Canada, entitled “ Illustrations of the Fossil Fishes of
the Devonian rocks of Canada.” (If this is published, a vopy has not
yet reached me. March 30, 1889.)

Edward D. Cope (41), in connection with a brief notice of the Part on
Fishes of Zittel’s Manual of Paleontology, takes occasion to give a
synopsis of his own views on the subject of the classification of the low-
est vertebrata, in anticipation, as he informs the reader, of a fuller
memoir with illustrations.

J. W. Hulke (118) discusses the characters of Ornithopsis, H. G. See-
ley, and Omosaurus, R. Owen, pointing out the propriety of following
the classification of Professor Marsh, and places Ornithopsis in the
group Sauropoda, and Omosaurus in the group Stegosauria. He
questions whether the specimens in the Leeds collection called Omo-
saurus should not with justice be reterred to the genus Stegosaurus,
Marsh. :

R. Lydekker (153), in an article in the Geological Magazine, makes
some corrections in his Catalogue of Fossil Reptilia, suggested by con-
versations with O. C. Marsh during a visit to the Dinosaurian and other
collections in the British Museum. :

O. C. Marsh (164) describes one new genus and five new species of
Dinosaurs from the Potomac formation in Prince George’s County,
Maryland :

Pleurocelus nanus, gen. et sp. nov., p. 90-92, f. 1-6.
Pleurocelus altus, sp. nov., p. 92.

Priconodon crassus, gen. et sp. noy., p. 93, f. 7-9.
Allosaurus medius, sp. noy., p. 93.

Celurus gracilis, sp. nov., p. 94.

The same author (162, 163) describes the principal characteristics of
the skull and dermal armor of Stegosaurus, illustrating them by numer-
ous figures.

The paper by E. D. Cope (53) is a short notice of the paper just men-
tioned. EK. D. Cope (38) discusses the characters of the Dinosaurian
genus Celurus of Marsh. He regards the genus as Dinosaurian, allied
to Megadactylus, Hitchcock, and describes the following new species:
Colurus longicollis, p. 368, and Celurus Bauri, p. 368.

H. G. Seeley (234) discusses the characters of a vertebrate from the
Wealden Beds of the Isle of Wight, called Thecospondylus Daviest,
Seeley, and compares it with Celurus fragilis of Marsh.
PALEONTOLOGY. 299

. G. Baur (12) gives some points upon the classification and relations
of the Ichthyopterygia. He concludes that “ the Ichthyopterygia were
developed from land-living reptiles which very much approacly the
Sphenodontidie ;” he classifies them in three families, viz: (1) Mixo-
sauride, Baur (including the genus Mixosaurus, Baur); (2) Ichthyo-
sauridxe, Bonaparte (including the genus [chthyosaurus, Koenig, ete.) 5
(3) Baptanodontide, Marsh (including Baptanodon, Marsh).

F. W. Cragin (55) describes, without figures, Trinacromerum (gen.
nov.) and 7. Bentonianum (sp. nov.), pp. 405-407. This species is said
to belong to the order Sauropterygia, to resemble the genus Baptano-
don, Marsh, and it may be identical generically with Piratosaurus, Leidy.
The author promises a fuller paper with illustrations in the - Bulletin
of the Washburn College Laboratory of Natural History, Topeka,
Kansas.”

E. D. Cope (52) announces the discovery of the remains of the genus
Goniopholis, and describes a new species under the name of G. Lucasti,
p. 1107 (no figure). In the paper (39) on American Triassie Rhyncho-
cephalia, he describes, more fully than in the original article, Typo-
thorax coccinarium, Cope, and from the study of new material he con-
eludes that the species is allied closely to the genus Atosaurus of
Fraas. In another paper (43), the same author describes the following
‘new species from the Trias of North America:

Episcoposaurus horridus, p.213; the genus of this species is also new and is con-
trasted with Belodon. (No illustrations. )
Tanystropheus Willistoni, p.227. (No figure.)

Additional characters are described for the following species :

Eupelon durus, Cope.
Typothorax coccinarum, Cope.
Belodon buceros, Cope.

Belodon scolopax, Cope.
Tanystropheus longicollis, Cope.
Tanystropheus Bauri, Cope.

Henry F. Osborne (204) compares and contrasts the two genera
Dromatherium, Emmons, and Microconodon, Osborne, and finds reason
for considering them quite distinct types of animals. The Dromatherium
he regards as distinct from any known mammal, recent or fossil, pre-
senting some reptilian features, while the Microconodon is a more re-
cent type and approaches in the form of its teeth some of the Jurassic
mammals. The genus Microconodon was described by the author in
the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science for
1886, page 362. It is founded upon the specimen in the collection of
the Academy of Natural Science at Philadelphia, which was originally
named Dromatherium by Emmons. The type of Dromatherium is dD.
sylvestre, Emmons, 1857, the original specimen belonging to the museum
of Williams College. In this paper both specimens are figured.

O. C. Marsh (159) gives a most valuable contribution to our knowledge
of Mesozoic mammals, and describes with illustrations the rollowing
new species and genera:

These are distributed among the following families, viz,1 and 2 in
Plagiaulacide, 3 and 4 with Dryolestes in Dryolestidw, 5 and 6, and
Diplocynodon and Docadon in the family Diplocynodontide, 7 in the
family Spalacotheridx, the genus Tinodon in the family Tinodontide,
Triconodon and the new genus Priacodon in the family Triconodontide,
and 8 in the family Paurodontide.

The author regards none of the known Mesozoic mammals as truly
herbivorous. The Triassic mammals belonging to the two families
Dromatheridz and Microlestid# are quite distinct from any of the Ju-
rassic forms. With a few exceptions the Mesozoic mammals best pre-
served are manifestly low generalized forms without any distinctive
marsupial characters (p. 344). They are distributed by the author in
the three orders, Pantotheria (Marsh, 1880), Altotheria (Marsh, 1880),
and Marsupialia; the families Plagiaulacide and Microlestidz alone
being referred to the latter order. The paper (160) in the Geological
Magazine appears to be a republication of the above.

H. F. Osborne (203, 210) published an abstract of a paperon Mesozoic
mammalia in the Proceedings (203), which is published in full in the
Journal (210) of the Academy of Natural Science, Philadelphia. The
author classifies the Mesozoic mammals primarily into two groups: (1)
The suborder Multituberculata, Cope, 1884; (11) A suborder, possibly
equivalent to Polyprotodonta, called by him “ proto-Marsupialia,” p. 10.
In the suborder Multituberculata are included the families, 1. Plagiaula-
cid, Marsh; 2. Bolodontide.

In the suborder “ proto-Marsupialia” are arranged in several sub-
groups the following families :

Carnivorous sub-group, A. (1) Triconodontidie (Marsh); (la) Phas-
colotheride (Owen) ; (2) Spalacotheridze (Owen), (“equivalent to Tino-
dontidxe, Marsh”). Omnivorous sub-group, B. (4) Peralestidz (and ?
Paurodontidz, Marsh), and Diplocynodontidie (Marsh). Insectivorous
subgroup, (3) Amplotheridz, C. (5) Stylodontide (Marsh). Herbiv-

PALEONTOLOGY. 301

orous sub group, D. (6) Athrodontids, of which the genus Athrodon
(gen. noy.) is based upon the maxilla of Stylodon pusillus (Owen).

The Multituberculata are regarded as a sub-order of the Marsupialia,
while the second sub-order presents no characters associating them with
known Marsupialia.

Osborne (215) gives additional observations upon the structure and
classification of Mesozoic mammals, and offers the following summary,
pp. 300-301, of the principal features of this contribution:

“The principal features of the present contribution are the follow-
ing: (1) Additional characters of Amphilestes and the probable determi-
nation of the premolar-molar formula. (2) Additional characters of
Phascolotherium, suggesting a division between molars and premolars.
(3) A review of the Amphitylus dentition. (4) The union of Leptocladus
dubius and Spalacotherium minus with Peramus, and determination of
the mandibular dentition of the latter genus. The molars are trituber
eular. (5) The discovery also of apparently tritubercular molars in
Amphitherium and probable determination of the premolar-molar for-
mula (confirming Owen’s views); (6) confirming Lydekker’s suggestion
of the probable union of Peralestes with Spalacotherium, and of Pera-
spalax with Amblotherium ; (7) the probable union of Peraspalax, Am-
blotherium, Achyrodon, Phascolestes, Stylodon, and Curtodon into two or
three genera with a substantially similar molar structure; (8) the cor-
rection of the writer’s former views as to the family separation of the
Peralestide and probably of the Curtodontide.

“The general result of the renewed and more extended study of these
mammals has thus been, first, to reduce the number of genera and elim-
inate two of the families proposed in the memoir; second, by the dis-
covery of the molar structure of Amphitherium and Peramus, to substan-
tially reduce the number of molar types among the English genera to
two, viz, the triconodont in Amphilestes, Phascolotherium, Triconodon, and
probably Amphitylus, and the tritubercular in all the remaining genera.

“ This latter result is of great interest in its bearing upon the theory
tbat the molar teeth of all the mammalia have either passed through
the tritubercular stage, or have been arrested at one of the steps in
tooth development leading to this stage.”

Osborne (213) gives ashort abstract of the full paper (214), which was
published in the December number of the American Naturalist, 1888.
The author proposes the following nomenclature for the cusps of the
upper molars:

Protocone, for the antero-internal cusp.

Hypocone, for the postero-internal cusp, or sixth cusp.
Paracone, for the antero-external cusp.

Metacone, for the postero-external cusp.

Protoconule, for the anterior-intermedial cusp.
Metaconule, for the posterior-intermedial cusp.

7
302 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

For the lower molars the termination eis changed to td in the first
four names for the corresponding cusps, thus, Hypocone for the upper,
Hypoconid for the lower. The term Epiconid is applied to the postero-
internal cusp.

Osborne’s paper (214) in its original form was read before the Geolog-
ical section of the Bath meeting of the British Association in Septem-
ber, 1888, and also before the National Academy of Sciences, in New
Haven, November, 1888. An abstract was published in the American
Naturalist (see 213), and 214 is the full paper. The author defines “the
stages of Trituberculy as seen in different types” of the mammalian”
teeth in their order of succession as follows: I. Haplodont type (Cope),
not yet discovered. I, A. Protodont tubercular type; example, Droma-
therium. II. Triconodont type (Osborne); example, Triconodon. III.
Tritubercular type (Cope); example, lower molars of Spalacotheriwm
and Asthenodon.

Osborne (211) gives a review of Mr. Lydekker’s arrangement of the
Mesozoic mammals.

KE. D.Cope (50) discusses Riitimeyer’s classification with some remarks
upon the American types found in Switzerland. Mr. Cope (40, 45, 47)
adds some new facts regarding the vertebrate fauna of the Puerco se-
ries. In the first paper (40) the new species Psittacotheriuwm megalodus
is described, without figure, on page 469, and the species P. multifragum
is referred to. In the last paper (47) the author reviews his studies of
the Puerco epoch, while in the extended paper (45) the following species
and one new genus are described, without illustration :

Chelydra crassa, p. 306.
Onychodectes, (gen. noy.), p. 317. O. tisonensis, p. 318.
Mioclenus bathygnathus, p. 321.
Mioclenus pentacus, p. 325.
Mioclenus gaudrianus, p. 326.
Mioclanus lydekkerianus, p. 328.
© Mioclenus filholianus, p. 329.
Mioclenus floverianus, p. 330.
Mioclanus zittelianus, p. 334.
Mioclanus turgidunculus, p. 334.
Chriacus schlosserianus, p. 338.
Chriacus ruetimeyeranus, p. 340
Chriacus stenops, p. 341.
Chriacus inversus, p. 342.
Triisodon biculminatus, p. 343.
Dissacus navajovius, p. 344.
Haploconus corniculatus, p. 349.
Periptychus brabensis, p. 354.

The vertebrate fauna of the Puerco series has reached the number of
one hundred and six species, among which are represented Croeodilia,
Testudinata, Rhynchocephalia, Ophidea, Aves, Marsupialia, Bunotheria,
Taxeopoda, and Amblypoda.

H. F. Osborne (212) notes the discovery, by M. Filhols, of the identity
of Chalicotherium and Macrotherium.”
Bae, =: PALEONTOLOGY. 303

EK. D. Cope (51) states that he has found evidence of the presence of
the pineal eye in some ancient vertebrates, and calls attention to the
bearing of this fact upon the relationship of the vertebrates with the
tunicates. In the plates published with this paper illustrations are
given of Bothriolepis Canadensis, the skull of Mycterops ordinatus, Dia-
dectes phaseolinus, and the cranium or brain cases of Belodon buceros,
and Alligator Mississippiensis. The announcement of this discovery in
early reptilian vertebrates evidently suggested the following papers :
H. FI. Osborne (205, 206) upon reading Owen’s description of Tritylodon
of the Upper Triassic of South Africa, in which the author refers to a
vacuity between the parietals which ‘if natural, represents a fontanelle,
or it may be interpreted as a pineal or parietal foramen; it may how-
ever be due to posthumous injury,” infers from this the remarkable hy-
pothesis that “the primitive mammal of the family to which this be-
longs had a pineal eye of some functional value.” But examination of
the specimen itself by Dr. George Baur brought out the faet that no
parietal foramen exists in TZ'ritylodon (208). Thus suddenly the pineal
eye of the primitive mammal is knocked out.

Mr. Cope (46) gives some new facts regarding the shoulder girdle
and extremities of Hriops, and (44) presents a number of tables ex-
pressing the supposed phylogenetic relations of the several genera of
artiodactyla, tracing them through the various stages of the Tertiary.
The next (54) is apparently a modified form of this same paper. In
another paper (42) the author describes a part of the mandible of a
large cat from the Upper Miocene beds of Phillips County, Kansas,
which is named Macherodus, and specific name catocopis. No figures
are given.

Mr. Osborne (209) finds the name Athrodon, proposed in the paper
(203) above referred to, preoccupied by Sauvage, and he proposes Kur-
todon as a substitute.

A memorandum (89) of a paper read at the meeting of the Academy
of Science in Paris, July 30,1888, by M. Albert Gaudry, is given in a note,
Nature, vol. XXXVIII, p. 334, in which the author records the relative
dimensions of some of the larger Tertiary and Quaternary mammals;
Dinotherium giganteum is given the first place, and Mastodon Ameri-
canus of the Quaternary of the United States is given the fourth place.

Mr. Cope (48) announces the discovery of a fragment of the carapace
of Glyptodon in Nueces County, southern Texas, in beds which have
yielded Hquus crenidens, Cope. The discovery was made by William
Taylor, and the specimen is described and named Glyptodon petalifer-
ous (Sp. NOv.), pp. 345, 346.

J. A. Allen (2) describes from the Miocene of Charleston, South Car-
olina, Squalodon Tiedemanni (sp. nov.), p. 35, pls. Vv, Vi.

J. M. Clarke (29, 30) announces the discovery of elephant bones as-
sociated with charcoal and pottery at Attica, Wyoming County, New
York.
304 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

James Hall (96) notes the discovery of an elk (EHlaphus Canadensis)
[sic] in the town of Farmington, Ontario County, New York. The title
is as above, but it does not appear whether the author intends to in-
dicate the species found to be the red deer (Cervus elaphus, Linn.), or
the wapiti (Cervus Canadensis, Erxl.), or the true moose.

Joseph Leidy (147) announces the discovery of a new species of Hip-
potherium, which is described and figured, p. 310, under the name Hip-
potherium plicatile.

O. C. Marsh (165) briefly describes a new fossil Sirenian from Cali-
fornia, proposing the name Desmostylus hesperus (gen. et sp. nov.), pp.
95,96, figs. 1, 2, 3, Tertiary, Alameda County, California. The same
author (161) describes several new fossil mammals as follows :

Bison alticornis (sp. nov.), p. 323, f. 1, 2, Denver group, near Denver, Colorado.

Aceratherium acutum (sp. noy.), p. 325, f. 3, 4, Pliocene, Phillips County, Kan-
sas. 2

Titanops clatus (sp. noy.), p. 330, f. 12, Miocene, Dakota.

Allops serotinus (gen. et sp. nov.), p. 331, Miocene, Dakota.

Mr. W J McGee (176) notes the discovery of Ovibos cavifrons from the
Loess of Lowa.

W. B. Seott and H. F. Osborne (230) give a preliminary account of
the fossil mammals of the White River formation in the Museum of Com-
parative Zoology collected by Samuel Garman in Nebraska and Da-
kota. The following new species and genera are described :

Hyotherium Americanum (sp. nov.), p. 155, no figure.
Minodus tichoceras (sp. nov.), p. 159, sketch 2 of figs. 5, 6.
Minodus dolichoceras (sp. nov.), p. 160, sketch 3 of figs. 5, 6.

Hyracodon major (sp. nov.), p. 179, no figures.

Hyracodon planiceps (sp. nov.), p. 170, no figures.

The genus Menodus, Pomel, is defined p. 157, and the following gen-
era are recorded as synonyms, viz, Titanotherium, Leidy, Megacer-
ops, Leidy, Brontotherium, Marsh, (? Symborodon Cope), Diconodon,
Marsh. Restorations are given on plate i of Hoplophoneus primevus,
Leidy, one-fourth natural size, and on plate ii of Menodus Proutii, Leidy,
one-sixteenth natural size. Amynodon, Marsh, 1877, is defined on p. 164,
and the author’s genus Orthocynodon (Scott and Osborne, 1883) is con-
sidered to be a probable synonym. The new genus Metamynodon is
named and deseribed, p. 165, founded upon the new species JM. plant-
frons, pp. 165-169, f. 7,8, 9, and the genus is referred to the Amynodon-
tide.

The same authors report upon vertebrate fossils of the Uinta forma-

Richard Owen (217) presents the evidence of the existence in Amer-
ica of mammals of the ‘‘ Plastic Clay” period.

Madame Pavlow (221) gives an account of comparative study of the
history of the Ungulates of America and Europe.

Alexander Winchell (305) announces the discovery of bones of the
extinct Platygonus compressus in Ionia County, Michigan. The author
states that the bones are being arranged into four skeletons in the mu-
seum of the University of Michigan, and will be described and illus-
trated at some future time.

E. D. Cope (46a) describes the following new genus and species from
the John Day Miocene of North America:

Bothrolabis, Cope, (gen. nov.), p. 66, type B. rostratus, Cope; B. ros-
tratus (sp. rov.), pp. 77-79. The author states (p. 63) that lithographic
plates of this species have been printed, but are unpublished. E. D.
Cope (54a, 43a) discusses the mechanical origin of the dentition of
mammals. The author attempts (54a) to show why the Amblypoda,
having at the start apparently the same mechanical condition with the
Carnivora, did not eventually produce the same result. He thinks that
the divergence of mammalian dentition into two types, the tritubercu-
lar and the quadritubercular, has been due to the adoption of different
food habits. ‘The tritubercular,” he says, ‘is the primitive, and is
adapted for softer food, as flesh, so that the primitive Mammalia were
carnivorous, or nearly so. The mastication of hard food was impossi-
ble until the molars of the two series opposed each other, and this was
not accomplished until the quadritubercular or superior molar was pro-
duced.”

Sir William Dawson (67) describes the Sporocarps of the Erian
Shale. The circular specimens, originally described as Sporangites
Huronensis, Dawson, are referred to the Protosalvinia Huronensis, Daw-
son, page 138. The bifurcate form is described under the name Sporo-
carpon furcatum, page 139, and is illustrated in fig. 1, a, b, ¢, d.

A remarkable specimen of Devonian Lepidodendron is briefly de-
scribed by C—— (56). Mention is made of the discovery of a large
portion, 15 feet long, of the stem of a Lepidodendron primevum, Rogers
(2), from the arenaceous Portage Shales of Naples, Ontario County,

cicatrices of the leaves are well preserved in the specimen, and present
considerable difference in form and arrangement on different parts of
the stem.

Leo Lesquereux (151) describes ‘several Carboniferous forms from
near Gadsden, Alabama. The following are the new species: Rhabdo-

J. S. Newberry (196 and 200) describes some specimens of fossil
plants from San Juancito, Honduras, brought by Charles M. Rolker,
and other specimens sent by T. H. Leggett. In the first paper these
had been identified by the author, and were announced as representa-
tives of a Rhetie or Upper Triassic flora. In the article in the Ameri-
can Journal (260) fourteen species are mentioned, the following of
which are new: Otozamites linguiformis, p. 344, f. 9, 10; Hncephalastos
(?) denticulatus, p. 346, f. 5; Sphenozamites robustus, p. 347, f. 12-14;
Sphenozamites (2) grandis, p. 347; Anomozamites elegans, p. 348, f. 6-8;
Noggerathiopsis sp., p. 350.

An abstract, very brief, is given in the Proceedings of the American
Association of a paper read by Professor Newberry (192) on the Cre-
taceous Flora of North America.

Sir William Dawson (64, 68, 71) discusses the characters of the Cre-
taceous plants of the western territories of Canada and other parts of
British America.

The flora of the Laramie group is discussed by L. F. Ward (266), and
a short review of the same by Leo Lesquereux (149) is given. Professor
Ward (266) describes a considerable number of new species, and illus-
trates others which have previously been described. The descriptions
were first published in this bulletin (266). The figures, however, with
the specific names were issued in connection with the author’s paper in
the Sixth Annual Report of the U. 8S. Geological Survey for 1884 and
1885, entitled “Synopsis of the Flora of the Laramie Group,” pages
399-518, sixty-five plates, as explained in the ‘* Explanatory Remarks,”
pages 9-12 of the bulletin. The following new species are described

generic name Cressinoxylon.

N. L. Britton (18) has deseribed an Archean plant from the white
crystalline limestone of Sussex County, New Jersey, under the name
Archeophyton Newberryanum, and although its characters are very im-
perfect, Mr. Britton regards it as the remains of a plant.

Joseph Le Conte (146) discusses the interesting flora of the coast
islands of California. This same article appeared also in the American
Geologist, vol. 1, and in Bulletin No. 8 of the California Academy of
Sciences. The author considérs the flora of these islands as represent-
ing somewhat nearly the character of the flora of the whole country
PALEONTOLOGY. 309

during the Pliocene times, and that tbe islands were separated from the
mainland during the Quaternary period.

Leo Lesquereux (150) in a paper (compiled and prepared for publica-
tion by F. H. Knowlton, assistant curator of Botany and Fossil Plants
U. S. National Museum), has described a number of new species of

“The Geological History of Plants,” of J. W. Dawson, presents in a
very readable form an account of the plants which have appeared in the
past and are now extinct, describing their historical sequence and the
characters presented by the faunas of each age. The notes to the sev-
eral chapters contain much of value to the special student of Paleon-
tology. A note “On examination of Protaxites, by Professor Penhal-
low,” is inserted at the end of chapter 11. At the end of chapter 1
310 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

are found notes “On the Classification of Sporangites,” p. 84; ‘On the
Nature and Affinities of Ptilophyton,” p.86; ‘‘On Tree Ferns of the Erian
Period,” p.90; “On Evian Trees of the Genus Dadoxylon, Unger,” p. 96;
“On Scottish Devonian Plants of Hugh Miller and others,” p. 98; “On
the Geological Relations of some Plant-bearing Beds of Eastern Canada,”
p. 103; “On the Relations of the so-called ‘Ursa Stage’ of Bear Island
with the Paleozoic Flora of North America.” At the end of chapter
Iv twenty-seven pages of fine print are devoted to a note ‘On Charac-
ters and Classification of Paleozoic Plants.” In an appendix there are
eight pages giving “A Comparative View of the successive Paleozoic
Floras of Northeastern America and Great Britain,” and a few pages on
‘‘ Heer’s latest results in the Greenland Flora.” The volume is particu-
larly complete in its account of the plants of the Devonian of North
America, in which field the author is the chief authority.

Leo Lesquereux (148) has prepared for the annual report of the Geo-
logical Survey of Pennsylvania a short treatise on the “ Characters and
Distribution of Paleozoic Plants,” in which the plants of the Carbon-
iferous system are chiefly discussed. The author also considers the evi-
dences offered by plant remains of the physical conditions under which
the deposits were formed, and the relations the several geographical
tracts of North America in which coal measures appear bore to each
other during the Carboniferous age.

PETROGRAPHY FOR 1887 AND 1888.

By GrorGce P. MERRILL, Curator in the National Museum.

The years 1887 and 1888, covered by this report, have been years of
unprecedented activity and progress in that branch of geological
science to which the name petrography is now commonly applied.
Accessions to the ranks of workers, both in America and abroad, have
been rapid and constant, and the science now holds a place in the
curricula of our leading institutions of learning.* Prior to 1880, al-
though beginnings had been made by Wadsworth at Harvard, Hawes
at Yale, and Julien at Columbia College, yet the science was still prac-
tically unrecognized and almost unheard of in the majority of American
colleges and universities. At the present date it however holds a
recognized place in the curricula of Colby, at Waterville, Maine; Har-
vard and Amherst, Massachusetts; New Haven, Connecticut; Cornell
and Columbia, New York; Johns Hopkins, at Baltimore, Maryland ;
State University, at Minneapolis, Minnesota; State Mining School, at
Houghton, Michigan; State University, at Madison, Wisconsin; and
in the University of California, at Berkeley, in that State. At many
other institutions, the subject is referred to incidentally in the regular
courses of geology and mineralogy, or is taken up to some extent by
post-graduate students working for the higher degrees.

A pleasing and encouraging feature of this stage of work is the free-
dom from prejudice and pre-conceptions manifested by most classes of
students, and it is doubtful if any branch of science has shown a more
hopeful and healthful condition of affairs than that existing to-day
among petrographers. The disposition or desire at first manifest to
claim for the new departure all manner of possibilities, to solve im-
mediately the problems of rock classification, formation, durability,
and alteration, has already given way to a broader, more philosophic
spirit; and petrographers in general are disposed to hold opinions and
convictions in abeyance, to regard each new discovery in but the light
of one new fact from among the chaos of which, when sufficient may
have accumulated, may be picked out the general principles governing
rock history and the history of the globe. ;

*For a very complete account of methods and aims of petrography, the American
reader is referred to the neat little pamphlet of 35 pages, by Dr. George H. Williams,

entitled Modern Petrography, D.C. Heath & Co., Boston.

328 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1388.

It is a necessary consequence to tie late development of the science
that a great amount of detailed study be given to rock structure and com-
position as revealed not only by the microscope and chemical analyses, but
by their field relations as well. and that therefore the published papers
should be given up largely to what may- seem to the outsider the dry,
uninteresting and perhaps immaterial iteration and re-iteration of de-
tails in even their most minute forms. To enter upon a discussion or
to note even in abstract the contents of all these papers would be use-
less and out of place here, and in the body of this paper I shall strive to
show only the general tendencies of these, to point out if possible the
ultimate conclusions towards which they seem to be leading, leaving a
majority of the papers tobe enumerated in the biblicgraphy.

NEW PUBLICATIONS.

Early in 1887 there appeared the second volume of the second edition
of Professor Rosenbusch’s works on petrography, entitled ‘* Mikrosko-
pische Physiographie der massigen Gesteine,” the first volume, * Mikro-
skopische Physiographie der Mineralien und Gesteine,” having appeared
in 1885. The entire work comprises 1,541 pages, with 32 full-page plates
showing microstructures of rocks and minerals, and 177 wood-cuts in the
text. Thetwo volumes together form a most accurate and exhaustive
résumé of the sum of petrographic knowledge up to date of issue, and their
appearance marks a decided epoch in the history of the science of petrol-
ogy. Under the title of “ Hiilfstabellen zur mikroskopischen Mineralbes-
timmung in Gesteinen,” the same authority has issued a compact little
work giving in tabular form the crystallographic, optical, aud, general
physical and chemical properties of all the common rock-forming min-
erals. Itis of interest to note that upwards of one hundred and seventy
varieties are recognized. The arrangement is admirable, and the book
can not fail to be of great assistance to all students and workers. An
event second in importance only to the issue of Professor Rosenbusch’s
work has been the translation and abridgment of volume tr by Mr. J.
P. Iddings, of the U. S. Geological Survey, andits publication by Wiley
& Co., New York. As prior to this there was no comprehensive work
on the subject in the English language, the importance to English-
speaking students of this translation can scarcely be over-estimated.

Mr. J. J. H. Teall has published, under the name of ‘ British Petrog-
raphy,” an admirable work, which, though treating only of British
eruptive rocks, is the most systematic and comprehensive work of its
kird that has yet been published in the English language. Its size is
large octavo, with some 450 pages of text and 47 colored plates, show-
ing microscopic structure in both ordinary and polarized light. The
work is not a mere popular compilation of old and well-known facts, but
is quite abreast of the times and thoroughly scientific, though at the
same time written in such-style as to be intelligible to those who are
not experts in this particular branch of the subject. The American as
PETROGRAPHY. 329

well as the British student is to be congratulated upon its appearance.
Other new works in book form, but which the present writer not hav-
ing seen can speak of only by title, are noted in the bibliography.

ADVANCE WORK.

While a very large portion of the work of the past two years, as in
years before, has been purely descriptive of the mode of occurrence,
structure, mineral and chemical composition of rocks, yet the subject of
the origin of rocks and the causes of their structural variability have
been by no means ignored, as will be noticed.

THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS OF CRYSTALLIZATION.

For many years there has been a growing feeling among geologists
that the importance attached, particularly among German authorities,
to geological age as a criterion in rock classification was greatly over-
estimated, and the fact that neither mineral composition nor structure
are necessarily dependent upon age is now very generally conceded.
In his latest work, to be sure, Professor Rosenbusch has not wholly dis-
carded the age qualification, owing to the fact that it is,as a rule, only
among the most ancient rocks that the deep-seated portions have been
rendered accessible by erosion, while on the other hand it is often only
among the more recent that the effusive portions have escaped erosion
or alteration and hence are accessible for investigation. The now well-
known researches of Messrs. Hague and [ddings upon the rocks of the
Comstock Lode. Nevada,* showing that the “ degree of crystallization de-
veloped in igueous rocks is mainly dependent upon the conditions of heat
and pressure under which the mass has cooled and is independent of
geological time,” have received abundant confirmatory evidence, and it
seems now a well-established fact that under similar circumstances crys-
tallization and structure may be the same regardless of geological age.
More recent discoveries and studies in this same general line have been
productive of very interesting results. [na paper entitled ‘* On the lat-
est voleanic eruption in California and its peculiar lava,’} Mr. J. Ss. Dil-
ler has described a very interesting type of rock, evidently a true ba-
salt, but unique in carrying primary porphyritic quartz, associated with
olivine, a condition of affairs ordimarily considered on chemical grounds
as not likely to occur. The peculiarity is explained on the supposition
that the quartz was the first mineral to separate out from the magua,
and its crystallization took place under great pressure at such depth
and under such conditions of physical and chemical equilibrium as are
as yet largely conjectural. Mr. Diller has been followed by Mr, Iddings
with a paper on the “Origin of quartz in basalt,” in which, by a series of
analyses of quartz-bearing and quartzless basalts from New Mexico and

California, it is shown that the presence or absence of free quartz is not
necessarily dependent upon the chemical composition of the magma, but
that forms in which the mineral is abundant may yield on bulk analysis
as low percentages cf silica as those in which it is quite lacking. It is
also shown that a rock from the Yellowstone Park having a composition
almost identical with that of Diller’s quartz basalt has the mineralogical
composition and structural features of a quartzose diorite. Mr. Iddings’s
conclusions are that these quartzes are primary erystallizations from
the molten basaltic magma and exhibit no definite relations to its chem-
ical composition, their production being referred to certain physical
conditions attending some earlier period of the magma’s existence. He
is inclined to regard their formation as influenced by water vapor at a
great pressure.

This same authority has also published* some interesting notes on the
nature and origin of the lithophysze and the lamination of acid lavas
as displayed in the obsidian of the Yellowstone Park. The lythophysz
he regards as of aqueo-igneous origin, as having been produced by the
action of absorbed gases upon the molten glass, from which they were
liberated during the process of cooling and consequent crystallization.
The differences in consistency and phases of crystalization producing
the laminated structure are regarded as ‘directly due to the amount of
vapors absorbed in the various layers of the lava and to their mineral-
izing influence.”

In this connection a recent paper by Dr. A. Lagorio,t of the Uni-
versity of Warsaw, is of the greatest interest. The author gives the
results of several years’ chemical investigation on the nature of the
glassy ground mass and crystallized portions of eruptive rocks and
arrives at some new and important conclusions. These, in brief, are as
follows: He considers the “normal glass,” in which are dissolved all
the substances going on crystallization to form the crystalline secre-
tions of a rock, to be a silicate of the composition of K,O 2 SiO, (p. 508).
From this the dissolved oxides and silicates separate out in the order
of their solubility and the relative condition of saturation, the sodium.
bearing minerals, as a rule, separating out at an earlier stage than those
in which potassium is the predominating alkali. The order of crystal-
lization from the normal magma, as above given, would thus be as fol-
lows: Oxides, pure iron silicates, magnesian silicates, iron magnesian,
magnesian lime, magnesian potash, lime, lime soda, soda, and finally the
potash silicates and free quartz. The writer states further that the
minerals forming the second generation of crystals are never absolutely
identical in composition with those of the first, and are dependent for
their formation not upon a recurrence of like conditions, but rather upon
the composition of the residual magma.

These results, though extremely suggestive, are not, it will be ob-
served, in exact accordance with those arrived at by Messrs. Diller and
Iddings, to whose papers we have already referred. The results ob-
tained by these gentlemen, coupled with what is already known regard-
ing the phenomena of crystallization, seem to show that structural feat-
ures, and to a certain extent the universal composition of eruptive rocks,
are dependent upon (1) the chemical composition of the magma and (2)
the varying conditions of heat and pressure under which this magma
existed prior to and during the course of its eruption. A mineral which
separates out under certain temporary conditions of heat and pressure
may, under changed conditions, be partially or wholly resorbed, and the
condition of chemical equilibrium be so changed as to give rise to crys-
talline secretions of quite different nature.

Mr. G. F. Becker, in a paper treating of the texture of massive rocks,*
and drawing his illustrations from the magnificent exposure offered by
Mount Davidson and the Comstock Lode, Nevada, argues on chemical
and theoretical grounds that the structural differences existing between
holocrystalline porphyritic and granular rocks are due not to condi-
tion of cooling, but rather to original differences in composition and
fluidity of the magma. Granular structure, excepting in rare cases, isdue
to imperfect fusion and fluidity of the magma. Porphyritie structure,
on the other hand, is the normal structure of rocks cooling gradually
from a high temperature and consequent state of very perfect fluidity.
When the two types of structure are associated it is argued that this is
due to a lack of homogeneity in chemical composition and to tempera-
tures sufficient to fuse portions, but not the entire mass. Granular
rocks as a rule, he argues, have formed at lower temperatures than por-
phyries of precisely the same chemical composition. Granularstructure is
therefore characteristic of rocks formed by the metamorphism of sedi-
ments and porphyritie structure characteristic of those crystallizing
from homogeneous fluid magmas. These conelusions are based largely
on a new law of thermo-chemistry advanced by Mr. Becker in a previ-
ous paper.t In this same connection may be mentioned the researches
of Professor Judd, who, in a very interesting and important paper in
the Geological Magazine for January, 1888,¢ calls attention, first, to the
great dissimilarity in chemical composition of rocks classed as enstatite
or hypersthene ardesite, the silica percentages in extreme cases varying
nearly 20 per cent., and shows that this difference is due mainly to the
relative proportions of the erystalline constituents to the glassy base.
Then, treating wholly of the glassy lavas of Krakatoa, he shows that
the obsidian, containing a considerable percentage of volatile matter,
swells up and fuses at approximately a white heat, while. the stony

lavas and pitch-stones remain unchanged. In the field this distinction
is shown by the pumiceous condition of the obsidian and massive form
of the stony lava and pitch-stone. From these and the facts that the
porphyritie constituents of the obsidian occur in * glomero-porphyritic”
forms he argues that this obsidian is but a refused portion of the older
Krakatoa lavas, and, after a discussion of Dr. Guthrie’s experiments
on the influence of water iu lowering the fusion points of mineral sub-
stances, proceeds to argue that this refusion and perhaps the volcanic
eruption of Krakatoa itself was brought about through the admission
of water in the mass of mixed silicates buried at depths below the sur-
face. The mass of anhydrous rock might be in a solid state at a compar-
atively high temperature, while the same rock rendered hydrous through
the gradual percolation of water would ultimately fuse and give rise to
all the phenomena of the eruption. As expressed by Guthrie, ‘the
phenomena of fusions is nothing more than an extreme case of lique-
faction by fusion,” it being impossible to tell where liquefaction leaves
off and fusion begins.

CONTACT METAMORPHISM.

Several fine illustrations of contact metamorphism have been described
during the two years covered by this report and mention may here be
made of a few of the more interesting and important.

Dr. G. H. Williams * concludes an admirable series of papers on the
rocks of the ‘‘ Cortland series,” near Peekskill, N. Y., with a description of
their contact metamorphisms or phenomena produced by eruptive rocks
on the adjacent schists and limestones. The eruptive, or dike rocks in
this case are norites, gabbros, peridotites, mica or mica-hornblende dio-
rites, pyroxenites, and hornblendite. The schists are highly crystalline
schistose rocks consisting of quartz and feldspar, with both muscovite
and biotite together with tourmaline, magnetite, and zircon. Approach-
ing the line of contact the schists become more and more puckered and
contorted and filled with lens-shaped “ eyes ”of quartz containing garnets
and other contact minerals. In the schists themselves are developed
staurolite, sillimanite, cyanite, and garnet, the amount of metamorphism
being directly proportional to the nearness tothe line of contact. At con-
tact the schistose structure is almost completely obliterated and the
rock becomes hard and massive, appears more or less fused with the mica
diorite, is highly garnetiferous, and consists of a great variety of miner-
als, ineluding staurolite, sillimanite, pyroxene, green hornblende, dial-
lage, scapolite, and sphene. Briefly expressed, the progressive change,
approaching the line of contact consist in a gradual decrease in the
amount of silica and the alkalies with a corresponding increase in iron
and alumita, this being accompanied by a disappearance of the quartz
and muscovite and the development of biotite, sillimanite, staurolite, -
cyanite, and garnet. In fragments of the schist taken up by the erup-

tive were found astill greater variety of metamorphic minerals, including
sillimanite, cyanite, garnet, staurolite, tourmaline, pleonaste, corundum,
margarite, ripidolite, rutile, sphene, ilmenite, zircon, magnetite, augite,
scapolite, zoisite, and epidote.

The limestones in the vicinity were by the same agencies bleached
and frequently rendered moreclosely crystalline, while lime-bearing pyr-
oxenes and hornblendes, zoisite, sphene, and Liner fies are developed.
In the narrow dikes the nature of the erupted rock was also modified.
The iron and emery beds along the southern and eastern portions of
Cortland the area are regarded as a result of this same metamorphic
action upon pre-existing material.

Johen* has described a case of contact metamorphism in which an
ochre yellow, fine-grained, and imperfectly schistose sandstone, consist-
ing essentially of quartz and mninute colorless mica laminze and clayey |
matter colored by iron hydroxide, has been changed by contact with a
dike of diabase. Approaching the contact the sandstone becomes green-
ish gray in color and the schistosity becomes obliterated. The green
color is due to the development of a greenish, strongly pleochroic and
doubly refracting ebloritic mineral, which increases in quantity as the
line of contact is approached. The stone also assumes a slightly higher
specific gravity and the fracture becomes choncoidal. With the in-
crease of the chloritic mineral there begin also to appear small flecks of
a brown magnesia mica. The earthy (triiben) material disappears, as
does also the small amount of calcareous matter observed, having ap-
parently gone to form the new mica. As the zone of immediate contact
is approached, the rock becomes darker till finally grayish black, and the
choncoidal fracture more perfectly developed. The microscope shows
it to still consist of the secondary chlorite and brown mica together
with the original constituents. At contact the stone is a typical horn-
fels or lydian stone of a clear black color and shelly fracture, but with
no new minerals developed, although the structural arrangements are
somewhat changed. Analyses of samples in which the biotite laminwe
were beginning to be developed, of the grayish black variety with
shelly fracture and of the typical hornstone, showed that the composi-
tion had in all cases remained practically unchanged, that the changes
were not-due to any addition of material from the dike. In contact
metamorphisms described by Stechert the sandstones and shales have
have exercised a very considerable influence upon the olivine diabases
cutting them. The material of the dikes was found to be more acid

hear the contact line, due presumably to the siliceous material dissolved
from the sandstone and shale. Olivine in quite perfect crystals occurs
near the contact but gradually diminishes in quantity as one recedes
till it is wholly lacking in the center. This is accounted for by Stecher
on the pupeestiion that the material of the dike cooled most quickly on

the edges and preserved the olivine which had formed prior to its injec- —
tion. The inner portion remaining longer liquid and becoming more
acid from the dissolved silica of the shales, redissolved the olivines.

Barrois* has shown from a study of the contact phenomena of the
granites of Morbihan that two forms of metamorphism occur, both struct-
ural, the one due to rapid cooling and the second to mechanical agen-
cies. In the first there is a transition from even granular to porphyritice
oraplitic forms. In the second a schistose form is produced ouly at the
periphery of the mass and due wholly to powerful mechanical agencies.

Greimt has deseribed in great detail an ccecurrence of contact phe-
nomena between the olivine diabase near Weilburg, in Hesse-Nassau,
and the adjacent schists. Here the diabases remain practically un-
changed, but that they are of finer texture at the contact, while the
schists, composed originally of quartz, white mica, and hematite with
lenticular beds of calcite, are converted into a-compact rock with an iso-
tropic groundmass in which are quartz, andalusite, spinel, and a chloritic¢
mineral. The change has taken place with a very decided increase in
the amount of soda and iron, supplied apparently by the diabase.

Riidemannt has described an interesting case of contact metamor-
phism in phyllites and clay slates at Reuth, near Gefrees, Bavaria. The
erupted rock is a biotite granite and in itself has suffered no other than
structural modifications and a slight increase in the proportional amount
of biotite. At contact both phyllites and slates are converted into a
hard, compact, blue-black hornfels consisting of a crystalline- granular ag-
gregate of quartz, deep reddish brown mica (biotite), a little muscovite,
and andalusite. This zone, some 120 paces in width, is succeeded by ¢
second some 380 paces in width of andalusite mica schist and this by a
spotted mica schist (Knoten-Schiefer) some 500 paces wide. Lastly the
least altered rock, the chiastolite schist zone, some 400 paces wide, de-
rived trom the clay slates, or a biotite rock (Garben-Schiefer) trom the
phyllite. Itis noticeable thatinall these cases the chemical composition
of the altered rocks is the same as that of the unaltered beds from which
they are derived, no new material having been supplied by the erupted
mass, though Riidemann would account for the formation of the hornfels
by the action of the heated waters accompanying the eruption upon the
materials of the slates and phyllites. The line of contact between the
granite and hornfels, it should be noted, is in all cases perfectly sharp
and distinct. The entire width of the metamorphosed zone was in the
case of the phyllites some 1,700 paces, and in that of the clay slates
some 1,400,

_ ated structure in gneisses and schists, together with its relation to the
original bedded structure, where such existed, has received a good share
of attention, particularly from British petrographers, and some very
interesting and instructive results have been obtained. That a massive
eruptive rock of the composition of gabbro may through dynamic agen-
cies undergo structural changes, including a paramorphism of its py-
roxenic constituent, and give rise to schistose dioritic forms, was first
conclusively shown in America by the researches of Williams* on the
gabbros in the vicinity of Baltimore, Maryland, and for several years
there has been a growing feeling among petrologists that the schistose
structure in many of the so-called metamorphic rocks (meaning meta-
morphosed sedimentary deposits) was not due to or in any way con-
nected with an original bedding, but that these rocks were in reality of
eruptive origin. That this is to a certain extent a correct supposition
may now be considered as settled beyond dispute so far as it is applied
to certain limited areas. How general this mode of origin may have
been and how far itis applicable to the great group of distinctly banded
Archean schists and gneisses is as yet largely conjectural, and few
would care to claim it as universal. That such structures are in any
way indicative of bedding and consequent sedimentary origin has been
vigorously combated by Lawson,t who finds similar structures in rocks
of undoubted eruptive origin in the Rainy Lake region of Canada.
Lawson, however, regards the structure as due to pressure supplied
not by orographic movements but by expansion in the erupted mass
itself during the process of consolidation, a view which is somewhat at
variance with that held by other investigators. Teall{ has shown that
the banded rocks of the Lizard district include granite, diorite, and
gabbro; are, in short, rocks of igneous origin, and their banded structure
due to the deformation to which the original rock masses have been
subjected. Bonney,§ too, has given it as his opinion that the foliated
glaucophane schist of the Isle de Groix is an eruptive altered by pres-
sure. His conclusions from a study of this rock, together with the
gneisses of the district around Quimperlé and the gneisses, granites, and
amphibolites of the Roscoff and Morlaix districts, were to the effect
that while both igneous and stratified rocks have undergone a certain
amount of pressure metamorphism, the igneous rocks being converted
into gneisses and schists, yet many of them evidently possessed a true
foliation prior to the earth movements. Callaway || has likewise con-
tended in favor of the igneous origin of many of tie gneisses and schist-
ose rocks of the Malvern Hills; proof to this effect being afforded by

theintense contortion of included granitic veins and by other mechanical
effects recognized in the rocks when studied by the microscope. Messrs.
Fox and Teall* have in like manner accounted for the local develop-
ment of actinolite schists out of the intrusive greenstones on some of
the outlying islands of the Lizard.

But some of the most remarkable results of dvnamic metamorphism
are those described by members of the Scottish Geological Survey t as
occurring in the northwest highlands of that country. In the Archean
areas of this region it is shown (1) that a great series of igneous rocks,
including gabbros, peridotites, palseo-picrites, aud quartz diorites, in
which pegmatite and segregation veins had formed, have, owing to me-
chanical movements, developed a foliated structure and become con-
verted into gneisses; (11) that basic dikes injected into these rocks sub-
sequent to their foliation have been by similar movements converted-—
(1) the dolerites into diorites and hornblende schists, (2) the peridotites
into taleose schists, (5) the microcline mica rocks into mica schists, and
(4) the granites into granitoid gneisses, these gneisses being still further
foliated by subsequent movements. ‘This change in the dike rocks is
in part molecular and in part chemical. The molecular change of aug-
ite into hornblende has afforded the transition of diabase into diorite.
Where lines of movement coincide with the margins of one of the doler-
ite dikes it has usually happened that portions of the outer part, it may
be but a few inches or feet, are converted into a hornblende schist, and
a further stage of change is met when a broad dike is traversed by sev-
eral lines of shearing, in which case lenticular or eye-shaped masses of
diorite are formed, around which curve in wavy lines beautiful bands
of hornblende schist. In the final stages the eyes disappear, and the
whole of the original dike is converted into a zone of hornblende schist
‘consisting mainly of hornblende and secondary feldspar, with a small
quantity of mica. This alteration has been attended with the formation
of segregations of vitreous quartz, and in the extreme cases by a com-
plete reconstruction of the adjacent gneisses. The latter alteration in-
cludes a production of secondary foliations and a more or less complete
reconstruction of the rock, the opalescent quartz granites having become
elongated and also clear and vitreous ; black mica having been devel-
oped out of the original hornblende, a white mica out of the original
feldspar, and a reerystallization of hornblende in the form of actinolite
needles having taken place, together with a beautiful development of
secondary feldspars.

Igneous rocks intrusive in Cambrian and Silurian strata are described
as having likewise undergone metamorphism, in one case a porphyritic
felsite being converted into a fine-grained schist, quartzite into soft
sericite schist, fine-grained diorites in limestones being represented by
green hornblende and chlorite schists. Pegmatite is described as de-

veloped in bands sometimes 100 yards across out of an eruptive igneous
mass during the process of its conversion into micaceous gneiss.

B. Lotti* claims to have traced the white and veined saccharoidal
marbles of Carrara and the adjacent Apennines back into their un-
changed forms containing fossils characteristic of the Upper Trias and
Muschelkalk. This metamorphism is ascribed wholly to the orographie
movements accompanying the uplifting of the mountain range. The
same agencies transformed the argilo-siliceous beds into mica-chloritie,
ottrelitic or other crystalline schists comparable with those of Archean
age.

MISCELLANY.

The study of the interesting group of Peridotites assumed an almost
sensational aspect early in 1887 through the announcement by the late
H. Carvill Lewist to the effect that the diamond-bearing rock of the
Kimberly, South Africa, mines was a peridotite containing numerous
fragments of a highly carbonaceous shale, and that the diamonds were
doubtless secondary crystallization products due to the action of the
molten rock upon the amorphous carbon contained by them. In view
of the fact that Mr. J. 8. Dillert had but recently described a some-
what similar peridotite cutting carbonaceous sbales in Elliott County,
Kentucky, the suggestion offered by Mr. Lewis’s paper seemed of sufti-
cient promise to warrant the sending of Messrs. Diller and Kunz once
more to the latter locality in the hopes of finding confirmatory results.

The fact that no diamonds were here found is ascribed to the paucity
of the shale in carbonaceous matter, Mr. Whitfield’s analyses showing
but 0.681 per cent. of this material against 37.521 per cent. in the shale
of Kimberly. §

Close upon the heels of this discovery comes the announcement of
the discovery by Professors Latschinof and Jerofeief of diamonds ina
meteoric stone found at Krasnosbbodsk, government of Penza, Russia.

If more proof were needed that serpentine never occurs as an original
deposit, but is always a product of the alteration of other minerals, this
has been abundantly furnished in two rather striking instances in this
country. A heavy dark dull green serpentinous rock occurring in the
Onondaga salt group at Syracuse, New York, and which had been in-
vestigated by Dr. Hunt || and pronounced by him as an undoubted
aqueous deposit, as typicaily illustrative and confirmatory of his theory

the origin of diamonds, while Maskelyne still earlier announced that the diamonds
of both Kimberly and Borneo occurred in altered peridotic rocks. (Daubree, Ann.

of the purely chemical origin of the mineral, has been investigated by
Dr. George H. Williams and proven beyond doubt to be an altered
peridotite, and eruptive. The second and equally striking case of the
secondary origin of the mineral has been furnished by the present
writer,* who investigated the well-known serpentine locality, Montville,
New Jersey. The stone occurs here associated with a coarsely erystal-
lized dolomite in such a way as to at once declare an origill from some
other source than from an igneous rock. The mineral proved here to
be also metasomatic, ‘‘a product of indefinite substitution and replace-
ment,” after a non-aluminous pyroxene near diopside in composition.
The occurrence is so strikingly like that of the serpentines associated
with calcareous rocks, as described by Dr. Hunt, and also the serpen-
tine of the well-known eozoon, as to render it almost a foregone conclu-
sion that in all these cases the serpentinous material is of similar origin.
The number of mineral species recognized as occurring either as acei-
dental or essential constituents in rock masses is naturally found to
increase as the rocks are studied in greater detail and as methods and
instruments are brought to greater perfection. Professor Rosenbusch,
in his Hulfstabellen zur Mikroskopischen Mineralbestimmung, gives
upwards of one hundred and seventy varieties, of which the optical and
micro-chemical properties are sufficiently well known for their determina-
tion in the thin section. Among the more interesting occurrences of
the rarer or little noticed of these may be mentioned the following:
The rare manganese epidote or piedmontite has been described by
Prof. Bundjiro Koto? as a characteristic constituent of certain schists
of unexpectedly wide distribution in the Archean system of Japan.
The typical piedmontite schist is deseribed as consisting essentially
of piedmontite associated with fine quartz grains and with accessory
muscovite, greenish-yellow garnet, rutile, feldspar (probably orthoclase),
blood-red iron glance, and also opaque erystals of the same mineral.
The glaucophane rocks also carry it to some extent. The same mineral
has also been noted by Professor Haworth as occurring sparingly in the
quartz porphyries of southwestern Missouri in the United States. The
allied mineral allanite, first noted as a common constituent of many
granites by Messrs. Cross and Iddings, has been observed by Cross f{
as a constituent of the quartz porphyries of the Leadville region, and
has also been deseribed by W.H. Hobbs § in the form of parallel inter-
growth with epidote, as a characteristic constituent of a granite porphyry
from Iehester, Maryland. Graeff || has noted the presence of laavenite
in the elzolite syenites of Brazil. Cohen J calls attention to the fact

that andalusite, a mineral considered as normally a product of con-
tact metamorphism in the crystalline schists, is in microscopic forms
a by no means rare constituent of the true granites. Williams* de-
scribes for the first time in this country the presence of pleonast (her-
eynite) as occurring in the norites of the Hudson River region, New
York, and also perowskite as a microscopic constituent of the altered
peridotite at Syracuse, in the same State. A more interesting discov-
ery than any of the above is that of the occurrence of leucite, hitherto
found only in recent lavas, in some paleozoic eruptions of Brazil, as an-
nounced by Derby.t Schmidt has noted for the first time the altera-
tion of olivine in a melaphyr from the Swiss Alps into a bastite-like
substance. Williams {has noted the occurrence of rutile secondary
after ilmenite in a decomposed diabase from the Big Quinnesec Falls
of the Menominee River, Wisconsin. That, however, these are in fact
alteration products Cathrein denies.§ This last-named authority has
also describe:l || an interesting case of the occurrence of plagioclase
pseudomorphous after garnets in a garnet amphibolite from the Swiss
Alps. The mineral cordierite, as an essential constituent of rock
masses, has for the first time in America been observed by Hovey { in
@ gneiss occurring near Guilford, Connecticut.

The secondary enlargement of the mineral particles of fragmental
rocks as described by Térnebohm, Sorby, Irving, and Van Hise, has be-
come a matter of almost daily observation. Such growths are not,
however, confined to clastic rocks. Becke has described a case of sec-
ondary enlargements of the hornblende in massive eruptive rocks, and
Van Hise ** has described a like secondary growth of hornblende upon
both hornblende and augites in certain Wisconsin diabases. Lastly,
the present writer has described ft a case of the secondary enlargement
of augites by fresh deposition of augitic material in a peridotite from
Little Deer Isle, on the coast of Maine.

Disensses the structures of the crystalline shists and their probable origin ;

their age, to what extent crystalline and sedimentary rocks are affected by intru-
sive nasses and the resemblance of such secondary structures to gneisses and
schists commonly regarded as of Archwan age. The rocks carry, besides glauco-
phane, abundant garnets, epidote, green hornblende, white mica, quartz, sphene,
rutile, and hematite. They are commonly schistose in structure and occasionally
banded, the banding being produced by a predominance of epidote or sometimes
glaucophane. The rocks are sometimes extraordinarily rich in glancophane,
though the individual crystals are not generally large. The writer agrees with
Dr. Barrois, that the crystallization of the mineral has taken place since the folia-
tion of the rocks, as they show no signs of strain or fracture. The garnets, on the
other hand, existed prior to the foliation, as witnessed by their shattered condition.
The rock appears interstratified with the adjacent schists; but, nevertheless, Pro-
fessor Bonney is inclined to regard it as an eruptive, altered by pressure. He has
further described the gneisses of the district around Quimperlé with especial ref-
erence to their original and secondary structures, and the gneisses, granites, and
auphibolites of the Roscoff and Morlaix district. His conclusions are that while
both igneous and stratified rocks have undergone a certain amonnt of pressure
metamorphism, the igneous rocks being converted into gneisses and schists, yet
many of the Brittany gneisses and schists were evidently true foliated rocks
anterior to the earth movements. Contact metamorphism produced by igneons
rocks on the Paleozoic sediments does not produce rocks which resemble the pre-
sumable Archean gneisses and schists.

the gneissic and schistose rocks of the Malvern Hills are formed out of igneous
materials and owe their foliated structure to regional pressure, as proven by the
intense contortion of granitic veins and by the mechanical effects recognized in
the rocks under the microscope.

ture through merely mechanical agencies. Regardsit as preduced by a forcing up
ofa semi-plastic granite porphyry mass through faults in the overlying rock where
it was subjected to enormous pressure. Before final consolidation took place,
minor and subsidiary eruptions took place, which forced new supplies of granitic
material into fissures formed in the previously injected rocks, and this fresh mate-
rial consolidated under conditions somewhat different from those of the first
eruptions.

Describes from the Tyrolian Alps a series of six rocks, comprising: (1) Staurolite
mica schists, (2) garnet amphibolites, (3) pyroxenic serpentines, (4) tourmaline
granite, (5) porphyrites, and (6) pitchstone porphyry. The garnet amphibolite
is interesting mainly from its pseudomorphs of plagioclases after garnets. The
serpentines are derived from diallage, bronzite or enstatite, and are appropriately
named pyroxene serpentine. The porphyrites are classed as hornblende, uralite,
mica, and garnet porphyrites; the last are characterized by the occurrence of
numerous reddish brown garnets, the largest of the dimensions of a hemp-seed,
and with chanpeled and rounded faces shown to be due to oscillatory combina-
tions of dodecahedral with icositetrahedral forms. The pitchstone porphyry
presents a micro-crystalline or micro-felsitic ground-mass with fluidal struct.
ure with orthoclase and oligoclase porphyritically developed and more rarely
quartz and biotite. It oceurs in the form of independent dikes and stocks,
oftenof considerable size, cutting the prevailing quartz-porphyry and present-
ing sharply defined borders without transitions between the two anywhere dis-
cernable.

The rocks described are quartz-porphyries, diorites, porphyrites, rhyolites,
trachytes, and andesites. One of the more interesting rocks of the series is the
nevadite variety of the rhyolite. The sanidins of this rock often show a beauti-
ful satin-like luster, which is shown to be ‘‘ due to the interference of light in
passing films of air between the extremely thin plates,” into which the erystals
are divided by a series of partings parallel to the lustrous surface. Drusy cavi-
ties in the rock contain topaz in very perfectly developed forms. The andesites
are in part hypersthenic, as previously described in Bull. No. 1, U. 8. Geological
Survey. The quartz porphyries frequently carry the mineral allanite.

in situ., but in the form of bowlders of ‘ local o1igin,” and ‘“ apparently derived
from the hills to the southward,” and on the eastern slope of the Hayden
divide.

* The only other known locality for this rock in the United States is the Black Hills
of Dakota, where it was described by Caswell in 1880.

The rocks described are, (1) rhyolites, with primary corroded garnets; (2)
trachytes, apparently allied to the so-called sanidin-oligoclase trachytes of the
Siebengebirge in Germany; (3) syenites; (4) peridotites, containing essential
hornblende and hypersthene, with accessory biotite, plagioclase, apatite, pyrrho-
tite, and sillimanite; (5) augite diorite, containing olivine; (6) sanidin bearing
andesite, in which the oligoclase crystals are nearly always surrounded by a zone
of orthoclase.

DERBY, ORVILLE A. On nepheline rocks in Brazil, with special reference to the as-
sociation of phonolite and foyaite. Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc., No. 171, August,
1887, vol. XLII, p. 457.

Describes the geological occurrence and, to a certain extent, the lithological
characters of some peculiarly interesting nepheline and leucite rocks in the proy-
inces of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Minas-Geraes, Brazil. The more striking
features of the paper are the conclusions reached regarding the relations of the
phonolites and foyaites (elxolite syenite), the phonolite not only showing in-
clusions of foyaite, but also the foyaite containing inclusions of phonolite, all
appearances indicating that they are both portions of the same magma; that, in
short, the phonolite occurs as a peripheral facies of the foyaite. A second re-
markable feature is the occurrence of leucite in rocks of undoubted paleozoic age.
The full significance of these discoveries may be best comprehended by those
not specialists in this line of work if it be stated that the elwolite syenites are
deep-seated or plutonic rocks of paleozoie age, and of which the phonolites have
been considered the effusive tertiary or post-tertiary equivalents. Moreover the
mineral leucite up to this time has been found as a constituent only of post-ter-
tiary lavas. The two discoveries, it will be observed, having a very important
bearing upon the subject of rock history and classification, and bringing once
more proof of the utter impossibility of relying upon mineral composition or
structure as a guide to geological age. The conclusions reached by Dr. Derby
may be best understood by quoting the author’s exact words. He feels convinced
of, (1) the substantial identity as regards mode of occurrence and geological age
of the Caldas phonolites and foyaites; (2) the connection of the latter through
the phonolites with « typical volcanic series containing both deep-seated and
aerial types of deposits; (3) the equal, if not greater, antiquity of the leucite
rocks as compared with the nepheline rocks, whether felsitic as phonolite, or
granitic as foyaite; and (4) the probable paleozoic age of the whole eruptive se-
ries.

The principal features are a mass of Archean gneissoid rocks consisting of
quartz, feldspars, dark green or black hornblende and microscopic apatites and
sphenes. This is overlaid by a hornblendic schist consisting of alternating bands
of very pure hornblende and feldspathic material with occasional quartzes. This
rock often shows false bedding and is regarded as a possibly metamorphosed vol-
canic ash. This in its turn is overlaid by a mass of granitic or syenitic igneous
rock. The whole subsequently cut by a series of dikes including quartz-felsite,
diabases, and kersantites.

Describes a diabase porphyrite and melaphyr presenting certain interesting
features. The porphyrite occurs, cutting Eocene strata in its three typical varie-
ties, as a dense, dirty, grayish green, in places dark violet mottled or veined rock
carrying small nests of calcite. In the thin section it is pronouncedly porphyritic,
with long, slender plagioclases, which from their small extinction angles are sup-
posed to be oligoclase. The groundmass consists of augite and feldspars, some-
times grouped in tuffs or with a tendency toward spherulitic structure. The
feldspars contain inclosures of the amorphous base, often showing a mere vein
of feldspar substance. ‘The second variety is of a gray green color, and badly
altered, only the feldspars being recognizable while the base has gone over to
chloritic material, and granules of opacite, calcite, and chlorite abound. The third
variety is a reddish brown dense rock which the microscope shows to consist of a
confused aggregate of oligoclase leistens with interstitial irregularity developed
augites. The stone therefore presents all the characters of the pre-Tertiary por-
phyrites, although, as above noted, of post-Eocene age. The melaphyr is also of
interest as containing olivine, which has undergone alteration into a bastite-like
substance, here noted for the first time.

RECENT PROGRESS IN DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY.

By CLEVELAND ABBE.

PREFACE.

The previous summaries of progress in meteorology that I have pub-
lished since 1871 have each in its turn more or less imperfectly cov-
ered the whole field of meteorology, but it has not seemed wise for me in
the present summary to endeavor to compass a science which is now so
rapidly enlarging in all directions.. Several reasons have led me to
this conclusion, among which I may mention, first, the fact that the
American Journal of Meteorology, published at Ann Arbor, Mich., and
which is now in its fifth year, has, since the publication of my sum-
mary for 1884, endeavored to keepits American readers fully acquainted
with the progress in all branches of our subject, while the German
Zeitschrift, published at Hamburg, and which is now in the sixth year
of its succession to the Austrian Zeitschrift, accomplishes the same ob-
ject for German readers in the most exhaustive manner, and is of course
widely circulated in this country. Again, as regards recent progress
in instrumental meteorology, American readers will perhaps find a
sufficiently complete statement of the present condition of that subject
in my Treatise published in December, 1888, as part 1 of the annual re-
port of the Chief Signal Officer for1887. Finally,asmy own studies have
during the past year been almost wholly directed to the dynamical
phenomena that are offered to us in the movements of the atmosphere,
and as these are undoubtedly by far the most important questions that
‘come before the practical meteorologist, and are those about which most
numerous inquiries are made (or rather by means of which innumera-
ble popular questions must be answered), I have in the present sum-
mary endeavored to give an account of the important works that have
appeared up to December, 1888, on the movements of sterms and the
general motions of the atmosphere, reserving for a next report some
equally important papers that have come to hand since that date.

Some of these memoirs are so important and so little accessible to
American readers, that not content with a popular summary, I have pre-
pared full translations of them, which will be printed in the present, or
a following Report, in the confident hope and expectation that American
mathematicians, physicists, and meteorologists may thus be stimulated to

355
356 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

prosecute further studies in the directions indicated by the most success-
ful European students. At first sight these original memoirs and even
the popular summaries may appear mathematical and repugnant to the
ordinary meteorological observer, but meteorology, like astronomy, em-
ploys a wide range of talent. If the observer and the computer are
needed in both, so also are the physicist and mathematician; in both
cases we have to do not merely with the superficial phenomena of
nature, but also with the fundamental laws that underlie these and a
process of severe thought is needed in the discovery and the applica-
tion of these laws. It seems to have been conceded by all that meteoro-
logical phenomena, at least those which depend on the motions of the
atmosphere, are too difficult to be unraveled at present, but during the
past few years the application of thermo-dynamiecs has been so helpful,
and the study of fluid motions, whether discontinuous or steady, has
made such advances as to justify the belief that we may begin to build
a lasting superstructure of dynamic and rational deductive meteorology.
But such a work needs the co-operation of many minds.

The fundamental factors in meteorology and climatology are the
forces of heat and gravity; the figure, rotation, and inequalities of the
earth ; the circulation of vapor, and its latent heat; all this is summed
up in “the thermo dynamics and hydro dynamics of our atmosphere.”

For ages mankind has relegated to evil and good spirits, to chance,
to instinct or will, to the stars, the planets, the comets, and the moon,
to the fates, to sun-spots, to electricity, and to every other form of su-
perstition the explanation of our complex phenomena, because, in our
despair, we were not able to comprehend the possibilities of the simple
laws of mechanics. The labors of hydraulic engineers in handling the
turbulent flow of rivers; of astronomers in treating the motion of the
planets; of chemists in unraveling the mysteries of compound bodies;
of physicists in explaining the phenomena of light, heat, and electricity ;
of mathematicians in resolving the difficulties attending the treatment
of complex functions, were all needed as preparatory to successful
attacks upon the laws of the motions of the atmosphere. May the pres-
ent summary be the means of enlisting the co-operation of universities
and their patrons, professors and their students, in a work that prom-
ises results so important to human welfare.

having important bearings on our knowledge of the atmosphere and its
storms are to be classified as follows :

I.—LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS ON FLUID MOTION.

The imitation in laboratory experiments of natural motions of the
atmosphere offers an instructive and fascinating field for research.
Among those who have contributed to this subject are:

(1) Helmholtz, in 1857, first solved analytically the problems of vortex
motion, and in 1868 those of jets, both being illustrations of general
propositions in discontinous motions. Kirchhoft immediately followed
with solutions of other cases, and since then W. Thomson, J. J. Thom-
son, Rayleigh, Hicks, and other English writers, Oberbeck, Planck,
Zoppritz, Bertrand, Boussinesq, Saint Vincent, and others, have added
to these conquests of analysis. The experimental illustrations and
verifications of their results have been especially due, as regards jets
in liquids, to Savart 1833, Bidone 1838, Rayleigh 1879, Oberbeck 1877,
Reynolds 1883, and as regards jets and whirls in air to Vettin 1857
to 1887, Colladon and Weyher 1887,

(2) Oberbeck.—As long ago as 1877 this mathematician, by careful
experiments, reproduced the results analytically obtained by himself
and predecessor, all of which will be found in the appended translation
of his memoir on discontinuous motions. These jets in water have a
close analogy to the columns of warm air that rise in the atmosphere.

(3) Vettin, of Berlin, whose work began 1856, and whose first publi-
cation was in Poggendorff’s Annalen of 1857, met with an opposition
from Dove, that seems to have inspired him with the resolution to ob-
serve and experiment until all doubt was settled. Consequently, we —
owe to Vettin a remarkab!e series of observations on clouds and most
instructive experiments, illustrating the whole convective process by
which heat and moisture are carried by the air from the ground to the
upper atmosphere, and inversely the dryness, cold and motion of the
upper air brought down to us. Vettin’s latest contributions are in the
volumes of the Meteorologische Zeitschrift for 1887.

(4) Bezold, who, in 1886, was called from Munich to Berlin to take
charge of the reorganized Meteorological Institute of Prussia, has pub-
358 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

lished the account of some carefully executed experiments on vortices
and other motions in water, illustrating points in the movements in the
air.

(5) Colladon and Weyher.—As to experimental work in circular vor-
tices nothing has been more interesting than that done on a large scale
in 1887 by Colladon at Geneva, and Weyher at Paris.

Colladon used a simple apparatus for producing vortices and arti-
ficial whirlwinds and water-spouts both in water and in air. A more
effective apparatus was constructed by Weyher, in which a great variety
of interesting vortical phenomena were produced, illustrating what
migut happen in the free atmosphere if only the conditions were the
same. He established a drum, rapidly revolving abouta vertical axis,
which therefore set in motion the surrounding air of the room or other
inclosure. If the drum is at the top of the inclosure, the air thrown
out from it descends along the sides of the room, while, in the center im-
mediately below the drum, a rapid spiral or corkscrew movement exists
inward and upward. Water contained in a vessel in the middle of the
room is set in motion by the air, and some drops are even carried up-
ward through the ascending core, thus approximately imitating the
lower end of a water-spout, and showing how spouts and tornadoes
originating in the clouds settle downwards to the earth. Many modi-
fications of his apparatus have been made by Weyher, illustrating many
problems in vortex motion, and which are valuable for the comparison
with the analytical formule of hydro-dynamics, but which have only
indirect bearing on meteorological phenomena. They, however, serve
to remove from the mind any difficulties that may have been experienced
by those who hesitate to admit the importance of vortex motion in
meteorology.

(6) Reynolds.—Among the investigations into the motions of fluids,
that made by Prof. Osborne Reynolds, on “the two modes of mo-
tion of water,” has had a peculiar interest for me and seems generally to
be regarded as one that has contributed decidedly to our knowledge of
the conditions under which steady motion and eddying or vortex and
wave motions take place. Reynolds’s paper is published in the London
Philosophical Transactions of 1883. In his annual address, November
30, 1888, Professor Stokes says of it: ‘‘The dimensions of the terms in
the equations of motion ofa fluid, when viscosity is taken into account,
involve, as has been previously pointed out, the conditions of dynamical
similarity in geometrically similar systems in which the motion is regu-
lar; but when the motion becomes eddying it seemed no longer to be
amenable to mathematical treatment. But Professor Reynolds has
shown that the same conditions of similarity hold good as to the aver-
age effect even when the motion is of the eddying kind; and moreover
that if in one system the motion is on the border between steady and
eddying, in another system it will also be on the border, provided this
system satisfies the above conditions of dynamical as well as geometri-
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 359

cal similarity. The resistance to the flow of water in channels and con-
duits usually depends mainly on the formation of eddies, and though
we can not determine mathematically the actual resistance, yet the ap-
plication of the above proposition leads to a formula for the flow in
which there is a most material reduction in the number of constants,
for the determination of which we are obliged to have recourse to ex-
periment.”

(7) Hagen.—No experimental work has been done on the absolute re-
sistance of the air to bodies moving through it superior to that of the
eminent hydraulician H. Hagen, of Berlin; a translation of whose mem-
oir will be given in the series previously referred to, because of the fre-
quent inquiries that are made of me as to his results.

But in applying Hagen’s observed pressures to other surfaces, or other
angles of incidence than those used by him, great mistakes are liable to
be made, and the student should consult the chapter on anenometers
and wind pressure in the ‘Treatise on Meteorologial Apparatus,” Re-
port of the Chief Signal Officer for 1887, part 11, or the excellent mem-
oir of St. Venant, quoted below, if he would avoid serious errors.

(8) Aummer.—Allied to the problem of resistance, treated of by
Hagen, for plates normal to the wind, is that of plates inclined to the
wind, which is one that is specially important in problems relating to
gunnery, Sailing, flying, and the construction of windmills. On this
matter Kummer has made a serious of experimental determinations of
the center of pressure for a thin flat plate when struck by the wind at
special angles of incidence.

Although his revised results were published in 1876 in the Berlin
Abhandlungen yet they seem unknownin America, and I have therefore
re-arranged them in the following table. Kummer’s final measurements
were made on six stiff glass plates of the following shapes and dimen-
sions:

| ey oe 7

The center of pressure is the point at which the plate must be sup-
ported in order to remain quietly balanced when the wind is blowing
upon it ata given inclination. These points are always in front of
the center of figure, or between it and the windward edge.

The distance between the two centers is given in the column ¢; the
angle between the wind and the plate is given in the column a. At
first thought one would be inclined to convert the ¢, as given in milli-
360 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

meters, into decimal fractions of the whole length of the plate, and apply
the corresponding angles to similar plates of any size.

This can be done in the case of the square plate A, by simply multi-
plying its sides and its € by two, and thus obtaining the column 2A,
as if for a square 180" on a side. If the reasoning were correct then
the a in the column 2A should be comparable with those extrapolated
from B and ©, but the relation between them is not simple, so that care
must be taken in applying this data to other cases.

ld

coming volume Lv of the Memoirs of the National Academy of Science.
Asan early copy of the private edition has fallen into the hands of Drs.
Van Bebber and W. Koeppen, the latter has given a condensed review
of both chapters more perspicuous than the mass of details given in the
original. We shall do our readers a favor by laying this before them ;
and the more so inasmuch as the labor bestowed by Koeppen and his
occasional criticisms as reviewer enhance the value of his work. This
constitutes a most condensed summary of the results to dynamic meteor-
ology of the statistics published daily by the U.S. Signal Service.

BAROMETRIC MAXIMA.—The isobars around a barometric maximum
are of irregular, more or less elliptical, form. The ratio of the greatest
to the least axis of the ellipse, as determined by Loomis from three years’
observations for North America, for Europe and the Atlantic Ocean, is,
respectively, 1.91 for 238 cases in North America, and 1.84 for 252 cases
in Europe and on the Ocean. Ina third of all these cases this ratio was
more than 2. The same number is also found by Loomis for the ratio
of the similar axes in areas of barometric minima. The direction of the
longest axis with reference to the meridian is also demonstrated to vary
very little in the two regions, being as shown in the accompanying
table:

| | North Europe and

| wing | the Atlantic
| | America. | Oceailt
Maxima ..-.....-. IN). 44° Ht. 2 5.) Ni 75°
MGM Ben neice N. 36° E....| N. 35¢ E.

The more easterly direction of the axes of the minima on the ocean
and in Europe is by Loomis attributed to the frequent formation of a
ridge of high pressure which in the colder half of the year connects the
area of high pressure in Asia and the Azores. Three-fourths of the
above cases are of this kind.

Loomis subjects to a special investigation the especially intense baro-
metric maxima. He collects these in three tables, of which the first one
(Loomis No. XL) contains all cases in which, during the years 1872 to
1884, a pressure of over 30.85 inches (783.6 millimeters) occurs at any
station of the United States on the charts of the Signal Service; the
second table (Loomis LVI) contains the cases in which, during the years
1874, 1876, and 1881, an isobar of 785 millimeters occurs on the Hoft-
meyer charts, and their continuation by the Seewarte; the third table
(Loomis Lv11) contains those cases in which, during the interval from
1877 to the beginning of 1884, an isobar of 31 inches (787.4 millimeters)
occurs on the charts of the International Bulletin of the Signal Service,
which comprehends the whole northern hemisphere.

The annual distribution of these cases is given by the following tabular
summary ; in which, of the double numbers, the first one gives the num-

ber of separate occasions on which high maxima occur, each one being
separated from the other by intervening times of low pressure; the
second number [in brackets] gives the number of charts on which they
occur. With respect to these numbers it is necessary to remember that
for the United States (series a) there are three charts daily, but for
Europe and the Atlantic Ocean (series b) two, and for the northern
hemisphere one each day (series c).

(c) Northern hemisphere.. -- -- 1[1] 6[ 8] 13[34] 10[29] 4[ 4] %[ 5] 37[ 81)

In the other months of the year such high barometric readings do not
occur.

As concerns the geographical distribution over the surface of the earth,
the maxima occurred as follows:

Series (a).—Eighty-two per cent. west of 90° longitude (west of Green-
wich), and the greater part north of 46° north latitude.

Series (b).—Three-fourths were in Asia and only two on the Atlantic
Ocean.*

Series (c).—Of these eighty-one charts, seventy-four show the maxi-
mum over Europe and Asia, six over North America, and one on the
ocean west of Ireland. The station with the highest pressure occurred
in Europe or Asia, always between latitude 50° and 60° north, with one
exception, when it was at Taschkent; in thirty-two cases it was at
Jenisseisk (latitude 58°.5 north); in nine cases at Barnaul (53° north),
and in seven cases at Nertschinsk (51° north), and the other seven at
Semipalatinsk (50°.5 north). Within Europe proper such extreme
maxima were observed only in European Russia, and the centers oc-
curred either at Wjatka, Kazan, Moscow, or Warsaw, the two latter
only once each. Such high pressures occur very decidedly only in the
centers of the continent and in the colder seasons of the year.

For such of the areas of high pressure as could be followed for many
days the following results are given:

Series (a).—An average movement toward south 40° east, or, if we con-
sider only the movement east of the Rocky Mountains, south 57° east,
with a velocity of 21 English miles per hour (eight degrees of a great
circle per day); the average movement of the maxima is therefore di-
rected more southerly than that of the minima.

Series (b).—In fourteen cases of long-continued high areas there were
eleven where the last position lay more southerly than the first, and

* On nineteen of these eighty-two charts, the highest isobar is 790, on five charts
it is 795, and on one chart (January 1, 1876) it is 800 millimeters; on this day the
maximum was at Omsk; in the year 1877, for which the Hoffmeyer charts were not
printed, there occurred a still higher barometer, on December 16, namely, 806.5 as
reduced to sea-level, or unreduced 784.5, which is the highest atmospheric pressure
that Loomis has found anywhere charted.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 363

eight where the last was more easterly than the first, as opposed to three
and five cases, respectively, where the movement was toward the north
or west.

Series (c).—For the maxima in this series, Loomis remarks that appar-
ently, by reason of smali variations of the pressure of the air, the cen-
ters appear to show rapid movements to and fro, but that in general, in
the fourteen cases where the isobar of 31 inches continued for at least
two days, the position on the last day did not differ materially from that
on the first.

The relative size of the barometric maxima in the United States was
investigated by Loomis for the maxima of Series (a) (Loomis Table X11),
with the assistance of the charts of the International Bulletin, but only
since October, 1877, because the weather charts for the United States
only did not cover enough ground to fully present these extended phe-
nomena. The mean value of the smallest diameters of these regious of
extraordinary high pressures measured between the isobars of 762 milli-
meters is 2,587 miles, which is equal to the width of the American con-
tinent at 40° north latitude. The mean distance of the centers of low
pressures from the centers of maxima was 2,371 miles on the east side
of the maxima and 2,381 miles on the west side; the value of the lowest
isobars in these measurements was 29.19 inches = 741.4 millimeters ou
the east side, and 29.57 inches = 751.1 millimeters on the west side; so
that therefore the gradient was twice as greaton the east side as on
the west side. If we reduve the adopted superior limit from 30.85 to
30.4, we find that the mean diameter of the maxima between 1877 and
1884 that rise above tbis limit amounts to 1,405 miles, and that the ba-
rometer in these is on the average 0.40 inch above its normal value.
For the maxima above 30.85 these values become, respectively, 2,587
miles and 0.75 inch. Since 0.75: 0.40 = 2,537 : 1,380, therefore the
diameters of the maxima are approximately proportional to their alti-
tudes measured from the normal value.

Series (b).—The mean diameter of the maxima of this series for wuich
the isobar 760 millimeters is taken, is at least 2,740 miles, therefore
larger than in the United States. The lowest isobar on the west side
was on the average 739 millimeters—only in two cases was it less than
730—whereas this is a frequent case on the Atlantic Ocean; therefore
here also an uncommon high pressure does not imply a remarkably low
pressure in the neighborhood. The mean distance of the center of high
pressure from that of low pressure on the west amounted to 2,280 miles,
which indicates a somewhat greater gradient on the European side of
the ocean than on the western or American side,

Series (c).—The mean diameter of the maxima of this series is 3,800
miles in the north-south direction under 55° of north latitude, and
4,900 miles in the east-west direction.

The temperature relations of the barometric maxima are quite thor-
oughly investigated by Loomis. In the cold season of the year the
364 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

maxima are characterized by very low temperature. For those in North
America the following table gives from twelve years’ observations the
pressure and the departures of temperature for the stations that showed
the highest pressure at the time:

| Barometric pressure. Temperature dcparture.
Inches. | Millimeters. | Fahrenheit. Centigrade.
30. 5-30. 6 747-772 | —18.0 —10.0
30. 6-30. 7 772-798 | —20.3 | —11.3
30. 7-30. 8 | 798-823 | —23.8 —13. 2
30. 8-30. 9 823-818 | —26.3 | —14.6
30. 9-31. 0 818-874 | —26. 8 —18 2
31. 0-31. 1 | 874-899 —28.9 —18.8

This shows that the higher the pressure by so much greater is the
cold. The maxima of pressure and of cold, however, do not as a rule
secur at the same time and place, but lie on the average 400 miles apart,
and the greatest temperature departure ordinarily lies north of the high-
est barometer. (This which holds for North America does not obtain in
Europe.—W. K.) The temperature depression at the center is greater
when the center lies west of 87° W. longitude than when it lies east
thereof; for pressures of 30.85-inches the temperature depression is in
the first case 28.8° F. (or 16° C.); for the second case it is 24° F. (or 13.3°
C.). In three-fourths of all the cases in series (a) the thermometer at the
center fell below 0° F. (or—17.8° C.). In twelve cases it fell to—30°
I. (or—34.5° ©.). For the maxima of the series (b) for Europe, after
excluding the two cases of the ocean, the mean temperature fell to
—25.4° ©., and the mean for the three winter months fell to—28.9° C,
For the maxima of the series (c), in so far as they occur over Europe
and Asia, the departure from the normal was somewhat less, averaging
— 19° F., or—10.6° C., and the mean temperature was about the same,
namely —28° C. ;

For the average of all cases, whenever the thermometer at Jenisseisk,
between 1876 and 1882, went below—36° C., the barometer stood 7.8
millimeters above its normal value, but only in one of these cases did
the pressure exceed 787 millimeters. Therefore, extraordinary low tem-
peratures are generally accompanied by high, but seldom by extremely
high, barometric pressures.

In the warmer season of the year the temperature in the center of the
maxima is also generally below the normal, but only a little below.
For the average of the cases where the pressure in the United States
during 1873 to 1880 exceeds 30.35 inches (or 770.9 millimeters) the tem-
perature was 8.3° F.=4.7° ©. below the normal, and here also for places
west of 87° longitude the depression is greater, 7. ¢., 6.6° C., than for
places on the east of that meridian, where it is 3,8° C,

In the interior of the United States the highest temperature of the
summer usually occurs with a pressure that is decidedly below the mean
value, but, on the other hand, on the Atlantic coast it oceurs with
normal pressure. [or the North Atlantic Ocean and Europe-Asia
Loomis deduces from seven years’ observations the mean thermometric
departures at the time of the monthly maxima of temperature for the
months of June, July, and August, and for a number of stations. The
average of the three months is given in the following table:

Therefore equally as in North America, so also in the interior of the
Europe-Asiatic continent, the greatest summer temperature occurs with
a barometric pressure that is some millimeters below the normal value,
while on the ocean and also rarely in the northern parts of the conti-
nents, southward to Moscow and Kazan, the greatest summer tempera-
tures occur, with relatively high pressure.

BAROMETRIC MINIMA.—In order to make the comparison more com-
plete between the areas of high and low pressure, Professor Loomis has
also supplemented his work on the latter subject by a new collocation
of data, and his Tables XLIx and L give a summary of the minima
under 29 inches (736.6 millimeters) for the years 1873 to 1884 for the
United States and Canada. His Table LVII gives a similar summary
for the minima under 725 millimeters for the years 1873 to 1876 and
1880 and 188t over the Atlantic Ocean and Europe according to the
Hoffmeyer charts and the new synoptic charts, published jointly by the
Danish Institute and the Seewarte. This is the same material quoted,
respectively, as series a and 0 in the table of maxima given in the first
part of this summary. The arrangement of the data taken from the
International Bulletin of the Signal Service (series c) is carried out in a
different manner by Loomis as regards the minima, in that he has in
Table LXIx given only the minima under 29 inches for the Pacific Ocean,
and in Table LXtv those under 29.6 inches (751.8 millimeters), and only
for the winter season for the Asiatic continent. The number and an-
nual distribution of these comparatively deep minima, is as shown in
366 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Only the first of these series, depending upon twelve years of records,
can have any pretense of accurately presenting the normal annual rate.
The remarkable double maximum of frequency with a diminution in the
middle of winter will probably remain even in long series of observa-
tions, and has its origin in the development of the continental area of
high pressure in January and February. The small number of depres-
sions under 29 inches in the Pacific Ocean is doubtless in part due to
the insufficient data from this ocean for the first year, but Loomis shows
that even in the last three years (summer of 1881 to the summer ot
1884), where the number of observations was nearly sufficient, only
nineteen cases below 736 millimeters occurred in the year, whilst on the
Atlantic Ocean twenty-eight cases occurred annually below 725 milli-
meters on the average of four years; in the Pacific Ocean the barome-
ter sank below this latter limit only five times in three years, so that
such deep depressions occur sixteen times more frequently over the At-
lantic than over the Pacific Ocean. This result is confirmed by another
consideration: On the average of five years’ observations at Stykkis-
holm, in Iceland, the barometer fell below 725 millimeters on 6.8 days
annually, but in three years’ observations in the Aleutian Islands only
on one day annually. The lowest depression reported from the Pacific
Ocean during seven years is 719 millimeters, but in the North Atlantic
such depressions occur on the average about thirty times annually.

As concerns the location of these barometric minima, Loomis finds
that of one hundred and thirty-one in the first (a) series, one hundred
and twelve occurred on the Atlantic coast, and only nineteen in the in-
terior of North America; that, therefore, the neighborhood of the ocean
is an almost indispensable condition for these deep depressions. He
presents the location of the one hundred and thirty-seven minima of
series (D) on a chart that shows that three-fourths of the total number
occurred on the Atlantic Ocean or its coast, and that of the remaining
cases ten occurred within 100 miles distant from the coast; seven at
100 to 150 miles ; and only one, January 15, 1881, at Moscow, occurred
more than 150 miles from the coast. Within the area of the ocean more

centers of depression occurred in the neighborhood of the coast than in
its central portions, and four regions of greater frequency are especi-
ally recognizable ; namely, Southern Greenland, west coast of Iceland,
the islands north of Scotland, and the North Cape. This confirms in
general the results that Képpen attained and presented graphically
for all depressions without considering the depths (Zeitschrift Oester-
reichisches Gesellschaft fiir Meteorologie, July, 1882).*
Of the one hundred and sixteen winter days that show a barometric
pressure in Asia below 752 millimeters, fifteen show such depressions
simultaneously at many places; so that we have one hundred and
thirty-one separate cases that are distributed as follows: Thirty-seven
on the eastern coast of Asia and in Japan; seventy-seven on the western
border of Asia, namely, at Ekaterinburg, and seventeen in the interior
of Asia, at Akmolinsk, Barnoul, or Jenisseisk. The minima of the first
group seem to originate in the Pacific Ocean or on the coast. None of
them appear to have come from the interior of the continent, or from a
- region north of latitude 62°, so that the numerous depressions that pass
from west to east over the eastern part of North America seem to find
no anaiogue in Eastern Asia. The minima of the second and third
groups appear to progress from Northern Europe along a path directed
somewhat south and east, and none of them pass eastward over Jen-
isseisk, unless perhaps some of them are deviated northeastward be-
yond the region occupied by the station.

The highest isobar in the neighborhood of these depressions was on
the average, in series (a@) 30.29 inches (769.4 millimeters) on the west
side, and 30.35 inches (770.9 millimeters) on the east side; in the series
(b) the isobars of 785 millimeters and upwards occurred only twice on
the west side, and twice on the east side of the depressions ; the maxima
in the neighborhood of the deep minima therefore seldom attain ex-
ceptional heights—a confirmation of what is above said for the maxima.
The mean distance of the centers of these maxima from those of the de-
pressions was in series (a) 2,130 miles on the east side of the depression,
and 1,985 miles on the west side. The mean diameter of the depres-
sions (namely between the isobars of 760 to 770 millimeters) Loomis has
determined to be for the depressions of series (a) from the years 1877 to
1884, 2,139, but for series (b) 2,365 miles.

The mean of the temperatures at the centers of such barometric de-
pressions as were lower than 737 millimeters, was 69.4 Fahr.,=3°.6 C.,
above the normal in the United States for the years 1873 to 1877; but the
greatest excess of temperature did not occur here, but about 300 miles
farther southerly or easterly, and on the average, for the cases that
allowed of a satisfactory determination, amounted to 229.3 Fahr., or
10°.3 C. ‘

*Journal of the Austrian Meteorological Society, July, 1882. See also the charts
compiled by me for Walker’s Statistical Atlas of the United States, Washington, 1§74,
368 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

These deep depressions belonged, as we have seen, almost exclusively
to the colder period of the year; in order to investigate the tempera-
ture of the summer depressions, Loomis has brought together the depres-
sions with a central pressure less than 29.4 inches (746.7 millimeters)
for June, July, and August of the three years 1873, 74, 77. For these
the average departure of the temperature from its normal value was
46°.5 Fahr., or 3°.6 ©. at the center of the depression and +20° Fahr.
— 11°,1 ©. at the above-mentioned warmest point, therefore almost the
same as in the winter depressions.

For the minima of series (b) Loomis has determined only the temper-
ature at the center, not its departure from the normal value; the for-
mer is +4° ©, (399.2 Fahr.), which is very high for the season and the
latitude of most of these minima.

Loomis has subjected to a thorough investigation the relation of the
wind to the gradient. First, he selected from Hoffineyer’s synoptic
charts eighty-one on which there appeared especially well-developed
cyclones or anti-cyclones. For meteorologists who desire to submit to
a special proof some notable examples, he calls attention to the cyclones
of January 12, and December 21-22, 1875; January 22 and March 9
and 10, 1876; and the anti-cyclones of December 30-31, 1875, and Jan-
uary 1-2 and 13, 1876. Loomis says nothing as to his interpretation of
the arrows indicating the strength of the wind on Hoffmeyer’s charts;
under the assumption that he has properly considered the half-degree
marks on the wind arrows of Hoffmeyer’s charts, we ean consider the
mean strength of the wind deduced by him and given according to the
‘1 to 6” scale as correct Beaufort degrees, since the wind estimates of
both German and English navigators, on which these charts are based,
are alike made on the Beaufort scale; on the other hand, if he has
counted the half-degree marks as full scale degrees, then all his figures
for mean wind force, when they are uneven figures, are too large by
one, and therefore his mean values for the whole series will be too large
by one-half of a Beaufort degree.

Loomis’s results from Hoftmeyer’s charts are summarized in the foliow-
ing table; the measurements were generally made on that side of the
center where the strongest gradients and winds were found. The mean
latitude of the centers of the cyclones was 58°.8 north, and that of the
anticyclones 49°.7 north.

In order to determine the same quantities also for the storms of the
United States, Loomis has chosen thirty-six charts for cyclones and
thirty-six for anti-cyclones out of the twelve thousand published by
the Signal Office since November, 1871, which gave him the following

table of results.

as to the results that Loomis draws from them, Képpen promises a fut-
ure communication.

II1I.—THEORETICAL HYDRO-DYNAMICS APPLIED TO THE MOTION OF
TEE ATE.

(10) Aéppen, whose skill in studying the mechanism of storms and
in handling masses of data has so frequently been shown, has con-
tributed to the Meteorological Zeitschrift of December, 1888, a study
‘¢On the form of the isobars in reference to their dependence upon alti-
tude and the distribution of temperature.” Assuming that isotherms
and isobars have been given by the daily weather chart, he then gives a
most convenient and rapid method of computing tables and deriving
the isobars for any elevation, such as 2,500 meters, by an inspection of
the tabular figures. Such upper isobars were first published for a given
storm by Méllerin the Annalen fiir Hydrog., April, 1882. The impor-
tance of such upper isobars had been urged by me in 1871~72, and sam-
ple maps were drawn preparatory to their daily use, but subsequently
the introduction of departures and variations of departures in pressure
and temperature as auxiliary to sea-level isobars and surface isotherms
was decided on by General Myer. K6ppen’s diagrams of ideal systems
are very suggestive.

(11) Ferrel.—In 1886 there appeared a treatise by Prof. William Fer-
rel, “* Recent Advances in Meteorology,” being Appendix 71, or part II,
of the Annual Report of the Chief Signal Officer for 1885. This treatise
was originally designed as professional paper of the the Signal Service,
No. 17, but the abolition of that series of papers by order of the Secre-
tary of War caused a change in the method of publication.

An abstract of the contents of this book was delivered in lectures by
Professor Ferrel to the second lieutenants of the Signal Corps, but the
abolition of the Signal-Service school of instruction at Fort Myer has
prevented its farther use in that direction. The complete volume being
easily obtained in this country, I need give only a short account of it.

In this work Ferrel has collected the results of recent investigations
by many authors, adding to them many of his own demonstrations, and
combining the whole into a systematic treatise on meteorology under
the following seven chapters: (1) The constitution and physical prop-
erties of the atmosphere; (2) the temperature of the atmosphere and
the earth’s surface; (3) the general motions and pressure of the atmos-
phere; (4) cyclones; (5) tornadoes; (6) observatious and their reduc-
tions; (7) ocean currents and their meteorological effects. In the first
chapter, after the sections on chemical constituents,. pressure and
weight, there comes a section on the diffusion and arrangement of the
constituents, including the vapor atmosphere, followed by the ordinary
applications to the atmosphere of the thermo-dynamics of adiabatic
processes. In his section on the diathermancy and transparency of the
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 371

air Ferrel gives especial attention to the effect of wave length upon the
law of diminution in a complex bundle of rays, such as those from the
sun, and shows that his formula and constants hold good for the visual,
the thermal, and the chemical effects of the solar rays. (A special mem-
oir by him on radiation is published in the American Journal of Science,
July, 1889.)

In chapter 2, on temperature of the atmosphere, Ferrel gives an ex
pression for the mean diurnal intensity of the sun’s radiation developed
into a series as a function of the sun’s declination and the observer’s
latitude, which expression he also further converts into a series de.
pending on the time and the observer’s latitude. With this he then
combines the effect of the absorption by the earth’s atmosphere, and
proceeds to discuss the conditions that determine the temperature at
any place and any time for a body of any shape and co-efficient of ab-
sorption and radiation. The importantresults obtained in this chapter
depend principally upon the radiation observations of Prevostaye and
Desains, Melloni, Langley, Dulong, and Petit, and are applicable to the
temperature of bodies at the earth’s surface, the temperature shown by
thermometers and those shown by solar radiation apparatus. Especial
attention is given to the nocturnal cooling byradiation. (The late pub-
lications by Maurer, H. F. Weber, Angot and Zenker could of course
not be utilized by Ferrel.)

In chapter 3 Ferrel deduces the general motions and pressure of the
atmosphere, beginning with the equations of absolute motion on the
earth at rest, whence follows his law that all bodies in motion are de-
flected to the right in the northern hemisphere. Combining these equa-
tions with the equation of continuity, certain general relations are de-
duced expressed by differential equations.

Ferrel’s method of solution of these equations consists in successive
approximations, beginning with the simplest cases of no friction and no
disturbance of the normal distribution of temperature, he finally pro-
ceeds in section 4 of chapter 3 to give a special solution for the actual
case of the earth, which although only approximate yet within the limits
indicated, appears to agree well with observed phenomena; this solu-
tion is summed up in the two following formule for the connection be-
tween the barometric gradient (G) expressed in millimeters per degree
of the great circle of the meridian from north to south, the angular dis-
tance (@) from the north pole or 90 degrees minus the latitude ; the veloe-
ity (v) of the east-west motions of a particle of air; the total velocity (s)
of the particle ; the temperature (7) on which the density of the air de-
pends; the inclination (7) of the wind to the parallel of latitude ; the
observed barometric pressure (P) and the normal sea level barometric
pressure (Po). The resulting formula for the barometric gradient meas-
ured on the meridian, as given on page 207 of his “ Recent Advances,” is

372 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Substituting this value of G in the general differential equation of
motion, Ferrel deduces the following expression for v for the mean
temperature condition of the earth where h is the altitude, and G! the
full gradient at the earth’s surface; the last term is negligible as ex-
pressing the effect of inertia and friction due to meridional motions:

The coefficient A, represents the principal term in Ferrel’s previous
development of the solar diurnal variation of temperature in a harmonic
series that obtains for the whole year and the whole earth. Instead of
attempting to compute the temperature (7) Ferrel has preferred to
compile from charts of temperature and pressure the actual average
values of temperature and pressure and wind velocity for each five de-
grees of latitude for January, July and the whole year, for the north-
ern and southern hemispheres. The introduction of these observed
temperatures and pressures enables him to compute the value of v
which on comparison with the observed velocity shows a very excellent
agreement. The process is simply a refinement upon the numbers
already published by him in 1858, and is, I think, equivalent to the
statement that if among the many direct solutions of the equations of
motion possible when the boundary conditions are given, we, without a
previous knowledge of these boundary conditions, select that special
solution that we find existing on the earth’s surface as indicated by
our observed temperatures and pressures, then the resulting computed
velocity agrees with the observed velocity of the wind. After explain-
ing the annual oscillations of winds and calms, rain and cloud, Ferrel
passes to chapter 4 on cyclones. In this is given an elementary me-
chanical theory of the gyration of a small portion of the atmosphere
near the earth’s surface at any latitude, the resulting equations (7) on
page 238 being, of course, entirely similar to the general equations 13
on page 188 for the general cyclonic motion of the atmosphere about
the earth’s axis.

The treatment of these equations is naturally very similar to that for
the general motion of the atmosphere, and if Ferrel’s methods seem pro-
lix and inelegant, as compared with the beautiful work of Oberbeck and
Helmholtz, it must be remembered that he expressly states this treatise
to have been written for persons who have a slight acquaintance with
the mathematical progress of the past thirty years, and that he has
therefore adopted such elementary and simpler methods as could be
easily comprehended by those who graduate from minor colleges and
scientific schools, while at the same time he has also expressly avoided
analytical refinements that are not demanded in the present crude state
of meteorological knowledge. In fact, like all his other treatises, this
also impresses one with the conviction that Ferrel aims to be a practical
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 373

meteorologist rather than an elegant analyst. Heis satisfied with show-
ing that the larger features of atmospheric motion are abundantly
explicable by known laws of mechanics and that, therefore, the ulti-
mate details of these phenomena will undoubtedly be also thus ex-
plained, and this conviction is that which is needed in order to attract
to this study those who wish to devote themselves to “exact science.”
The formule for cyclones are treated approximately for the case of no
friction and uniform temperature; then for the case of a difference of
temperature between the central and exterior parts, the warm center
being a cyclone, the cold center the anti-cyclone; finally, the solution is
indicated for the case of the existence of both friction and temperature
disturbances. In the next section on the progressive motion of cyclones,
Ferrel states, on page 259, that “ the principal cause of the progressive
motion is the general motion of the atmosphere ;” but he also adds that
‘‘the velocity of progress is much greater than the general motion of the
atmosphere,” and his short discussion of this subject suffices, we think,
to show that the cyclonic progress is only to a small extent actually due
to the general atmospheric motion, and is mainly due to those causes
that determine the distribution of vapor and precipitation around ‘the
center of power,” as he terms it. By this precipitation and redistribu-
tion of heat, the cyclone center is, as Ierrel states, continually renewed
a little in advance of its former position. My own view differs from his
only in the relative effect attributed by us to the general movement of
the atmosphere on the one hand, and the tendency to the formation of
new aspiration centers on the other. Ferrel gives special prominence
to the former, but I to the latter; possibly he is correct for high south-
ern or northern latitudes, but my own view agrees best with my experi-
ence in the temperate zones; it appears to agree closely with the excel-
lent work of John Eliot in India, and is peculiarly applicable to many
abnormal storm-paths that I have had occasion to predict. I notice
that Ferrel, on page 260, quotes the lake region of North America as
possibly attracting cyclones by reason of the aqueous vapor furnished
by them: but would it not be more rational to infer that the course of
our great storms is determined by larger forces than the slight excess
of evaporation over the lakes as compared with surrounding forest and
prairie; that in fact the lakes are the result of the precipitation that
occurs from the atmosphere above them? Evaporation and moist air
are not of themselves able to produce a storm; we must have cold or
dry air ready to flowin beneath, and our present lake region (as well as
our ancient glaciated region) is so evidently located precisely in the
spot where cold northerly and warm southerly winds conspire with the
orography of the continent to produce precipitation and storms, that I
must consider the lakes (and glacial epoch) as the result of the orogra-
phy, and as exerting by their evaporation only a very slight reflex action
principally appreciable in the re-distribution of local rains and snow
and slightly higher temperatures in their immediate neighborhood. On
374 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

page 282 Ferrel shows that the formula expressing the relation between
the barometric gradient (G) and the velocity of the winds is very much
the same for the pressures and winds around a cyclone center as for
the pressures and winds about the polar axis of the earth, and is ex.
pressed by a quadratic equation s?>+as=)G. As the cyclone moves
from the land to the ocean the so-called friction term would, @ priori,
be expected to suffer a decided change, and the actual amount of such
change is indicated by the data collected by Loomis. Adopting his re-
sults Ferrel deduces a correction to his formula based upon the principle
‘that the frictional resistance of any stratum of air moving over the
earth’s surface comes both from the earth’s surface and from the stratum
above it,” and again, “that the direction of motion of the air of the
stratum above differs considerably in a cyclone from that at the surface
of the earth.” To me it seems that there is here not a sufficient dis-
tinction between the small and negligible friction called viscosity, which
acts both from above and below upon any intermediate stratum, and the
resistances due to impact and convection, both which operate princi-
pally from below upward; still the general effect is undoubtedly, as
Ferrel says, to make the gradient that accompanies a given velocity of
the wind at the earth’s surface greater than that accompanying the
same velocity of wind over the sea or at higher albibudes. Similarly
the gradient is less in summer than in winter.

The chapter on tornadoes deals in a very interesting manner with the
different types of cyclones in which the horizontal movement is less
conspicuous than the vertical movement; the formation of water-spouts
is explained as a special case of tornado action, and examples are com-
puted showing the dimensions of the spout as depending on the hu-
midity of the air. In a section on the force of the wind and supporting
power of ascending currents, Ferrel gives merely the oid approximate
tormul for the resistance of the air varying as the square of the velocity
and the square of the cosine of the angle of incidence, and applies the
resulting numerical resistances to the explanation of the formation of
large drops of water, cloud-bursts, hail-stones, and the destructive ef-
fects of tornado winds. Stokes’s explanation of the effect of viscosity
seems to have been overlooked. On page 314 he explains the effective
force of the wind against an obstacle, or in the production of drafts up
chimneys, as due ‘‘ not simply to the inertia of the air but to the drag-
ging effect of the air through friction upon the columns of air’in the
front and rear of the obstacle.” I presume that this ‘‘drag” is inten-
ded to refer to viscosity or so-called internal friction of gases, and appar-
ently the same use of the word is made by Hagen in his explanation of
the fact that the pressure against a thin plate depends upon the size and
shape and especially upon the sharp angles of the plate. It is a suffi-
cient answer to this introduction of viscosity to state that the value of
the viscous resistance can be easily computed with sufficient accuracy to
show that itis not an important factor in these experiments on large
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 375

bodies. The true explanation of Hagen’s results and of the production
of drafts by wind transverse to the chimney flue is found in the study
of the pressure within discontinuous spaces and the vortices attending
the flow of liquid past any resisting body. The same criticism applies
to Ferrel’s explanation of the pumping of the barometer, in so far as he
implies that friction drags away the air.

In his sixth chapter Ferrel gives an excellent exposition of harmonic
analysis as applied to periodic phenomena, which is followed by the
fundamental principles of thermometry, actinometry, hygrometry, ba-
rometry, and anemometry. Among the new things, we notice that he
introduces here the analytical portion of his investigations upon the
psychrometric formula, the numerical portion of which is published by
him in full as an appendix to the annual report of the Chief Signal
Officer for 1886. In regard to the reduction of the barometer to sea-
level he recommends, on page 598, the use of monthly normals for the
upper and lower station. In order to diminish the diurnal temperature
effect he has since then acceded to the present practice of the Signal
Service in the use of mean daily temperatures.

In 1886, to the great regret of his colleagues, Professor Ferrel an-
nounced that, conformably to a long-cherished resolution, he should
celebrate his seventieth birth-day by resigning official public office and
retiring to his homestead in Kansas City, Missouri. The leisure thus
secured, we learn, has been used in the preparation of a ‘ Popular
Treatise on the Winds,” which will be published in 1889 and be doubly
welcomed by the student of meteorology.

(12) Sprung.—In 1885 Dr. A. Sprung published his Lehrbuch der Me-
teorologie. Shortly afterward he moved to Berlin, and as instructor in
the university and as assistant under Professor Bezold has exerted a
strong and good influence on the progress of meteorology.

His Lehrbuch is by far the best treatise extant on dynamic meteor-
ology, and I have included it in this section of theories of atmospheric
motion, because Dr. Sprung has devoted two-thirds of his Treatise to the
exposition of the views that have been worked out by the mathemati-
cians whose names are already so familiar to my readers. Itis scarcely
necessary to say that the volume contains nearly all that had been sat-
isfactorily established in dynamic meteorology at that time. Those who
have not access to—or time to consult—the original memoirs should by
all means study this volume.

Of the other general treatises those that bear especially on storms
are:

(13) Greely.— American weather,” by Gen. A. W. Greely, in which
the statistics of American storms are quoted to substantiate the theory
of their progress by transportation in the general drift of the atinos-
phere.

(14) Scott.—“‘ Elementary meteorology,” by R. H. Scott, in which only
a small section is devoted to storms.
376 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

(15) Blanford.—* A practical guide to the climates and weather in
India, Ceylon, and Burmah, and the storms of Indian seas,” by H. I.
Blanford. This volume, published in 1889, marks the retirement of Mr.
Blanford as meteorological reporter to the Government of India, in
which position, since 1875, he has undoubtedly accomplished the great-
est works ever undertaken in meteorology. Wilde’s Repertorium and
Annalen, Maseart’s four annual volumes of observations and memoirs,
Neumayer’s annual Ergebnisse and Archiv, are the principal works to be
named in comparison with Blanford’s annual reports and Indian mem-
oirs.

In the present work Blanford devotes only a moderate portion to
storms, and summarises the results that have been attained in India by
Piddington, Willson, Pedlar, Meldrum, and especially the great work
of John Eliot.

So far as could be seen from the scattered records available up to the
end of 1876, cyclones are most frequent in the Bay of Bengal in May
and October, and least frequent, being almost unknown, in February
and very rare in July ; but with the more perfect data furnished by the
Government weather office Mr. Eliot has compiled alist of cyclones for
the ten years 187786, which entirely alters this supposed annual dis-
tribution, and makes the distribution almost uniform from June to No-
vember. The Indian storms generally move toward northwest or west-
northwest, and with very few exceptions the direction is toward some
point in the northwest quadrant.

The incurvature of the winds for storms in the northern part of the
Bay of Bengal is about 35 degrees, with a slight increase as we go
southward. The barometer does not fall for the approaching cyclone
until long after the wind and skies show that the center of the storm
is close at hand and only when the winds become strong and squally,
nor does it fall rapidly until the winds have increased to hurricane
force and the center is distant less than 50 miles. The most important
indications of the approach of a storm are therefore to be found in the
observation of the sky and clouds.

The storms of the Arabian Sea, on the west coast of India, have been
studied by Mr. F. Chambers. The storms that cross India as they move
westward deteriorate greatly before they reach the Arabian Sea, but
then at once begin to increase. The stormy months are April, May,
June, and November, but the records are rather fragmentary, and the
results will probably be changed by future study. The system of storm
signals for the Bay of Bengal is under the control of the Caleutta office,
and consists of a simple warning or danger signal at all ports except
Calcutta, where a much more elaborate system is used. There is an
independent system of storm warnings for the Arabian sea-coast by the
office at Bombay.

Davis. This little book is the result of a series of lectures for the
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. aie

Lowell Institute in Boston. The author is professor of geology and
meteorology in Harvard College. The work is written in a very popu-
lar and easy style, and deserves to be read and used in elementary
schools.

(17) Abercromby.—* Weather,” by Hon. Ralph Abercromby, London,
1887. As the name implies, this book deals with the weather, its
causes and changes, as distinguished from the statistics of climate.
Neither formula nor numerical tables interrupt the reader, as the ob-
ject of the author is to sketch the general principles of the science and
give a picture of the methods ordinarily adopted in predicting the
weather.

The present book reads as though it had its origin in the thought,
‘‘ Farmers and sailors have always foretold the weather by the sky and
cloud; why may not the meteorologist do the same?”

He therefore devotes one-fourth of the book to clouds and cloud prog-
nostics, and, again, fifty pages to types of weather. The last eighty
pages are given to the rules and methods of weather predictions or
(as the English call them) forecasts. His whole system, as he says (pp.
430), “depends neither on theory nor calculation, but solely on obser-
vation and experience, and success depends on natural aptitude and
the experience of many years’ study.”

To this we add, that these same statements apply to work in astron-
omy, chemistry, ete, and that he who makes forecasts merely by means
of generalization relative to types of weather and clouds, is sure to
suffer from the neglect of a deeper study into causes and laws of opera-
tion, but to those who have mastered these mechanical laws the addi-
tional information given in Abercromby’s book would be of value.

(18) Hliot.—The report by John Eliot in 1876 on the Backergunge
cyclone, and his report of 1879 on the Madras cyclone, marked an im-
portant step in the progress made, by one of the ablest meteorologists.
He tells us he began his inquiry with a strong bias towards the hypoth-
esis that cyclones originate between belts of parallel opposing winds,
but that this proved so unsatisfactory that he rejected it and adopted
the condensation theory, which accounts satisfactorily for the entire
range of atmospheric action that constifute an extensive and intense
cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal. At the close of his work on the
Madras cyclone, and after refuting some views as to cyclone formation
that Dr. Hann had advanced, Eliot sums up his own conclusions, from
which we make the following extract:

“The invariable antecedents of powerful cyclones at the two transi-
tion periods, April and October, are (a) approximate uniformity of
pressure over and around the coast of the Bay of Bengal; (b) light and
variable winds or calms over a considerable portion of the bay ; (¢) little
or no rain-fall over the coast region as well as in the bay; (d) hence
the weather is sultry; (e) hence the sea is smooth; (/) the amount of
aqueous vapor accumulates and finally gives rise to peculiar sky effects ;
378 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 18838.

(g) the immediate antecedent is heavy rain-fall, concentrated over a
portion of the bay; (i) accompanied by a strong indraft, which is most
marked from the Indian Ocean at the entrance of the bay; (i) this in-
draft from the Indian Ocean gives rise to strong winds and heavy rains
at the stations on the south and west coast of Ceylon.”

Of the preceding items (a) (>) (c) are invariable and necessary ante-
cedents, but the source of the energy is the item (g), condensation of
vapor and precipitation of rain, or, as stated in the Backergunge report,
the primary cause of cyclone formation is the production and ascent of
a large quantity of vapor, which is condensed with the liberation of its
latent heat over the place of its production instead of being carried
away to some distant region.

This independent confirmation of the views for which Espy lived and
died, as well as the numerous other generalizations not quoted by us,
after having been clearly apprehended by their author, were found re-
peated in other storms, and were confirmed in his subsequent memoir
‘On the cyclonic storms of November and December, 1886, in the Bay
of Bengal.” Eliot states that there is a marked difference in the char-
acteristics of the storms of one year and of another, which is explicable
on the same hypothesis as that which explains the variations in the
southwest monsoon rain-fall. These variations are apparently periodic
in Bengal, and when the Bengal branch of the monsoon current be-
comes strong the Bombay branch becomes weak.

- Pending the appointment of a successor to Mr. Blanford, Eliot, as
officiating reporter, has published the report of 1887 on the Meteorol-
ogy of India. On page 209 he refers to certain storms in Bengal known
as northwesters, which are occasionally as destructive as the tornadoes
of the United States, but his description does not enable us to conclude
as to whether they were of the nature of twisting tornadoes, or the
straight-line Derecho, described by Hinrichs, in Lowa.

On page 251 Eliot says the great majority of cyclonic rain-storms
march across the Bengal coast in the direction of the belt of lowest
pressure at the time of their formation. As the chief characteristic of
such a barometric trough is light and variable winds, it will be seen
that this principle virtually coincides with the rule of cyclonic storms
in the Bay of Bengal, which march in the direction of least relative air
motion immediately antecedent to the formation of the cyclone.

On page 271 Eliot states that “‘ the persistency of the pressure anomo-
lies (for weeks and months) is almost certainly due to the fact that an
abnormal variation of pressure in a moving mass of air necessarily
gives rise to or accompanies the modification of its motion and in con-
sequence of well-known properties of fluid motion this changed or
modified air motion tends to perpetuate the pressure variation which
gave rise to it.”

If I correctly understand this sentence I should apply it to the flow
of air over an obstacie where the change of motion produces a change
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 379

of pressure or vice versa a change of pressure produces a change in
the motion; for example: Standing waves are produced at the surface
of a stream which tend to perpetuate themselves; the atmosphere is
thrown into a system of undulations by mountain ridges, plateaus, and
continents (which undulations may also be horizontal deviations on a
grand scale) and into periodic recurrences due to their own inertia and
therefore as Eliot says, tending to reproduce themselves until broken
up by outside disturbances. This is the explanation of the special sea-
sons of droughts, storms, and rains that we experience in America, and
it doubtless obtains equally in India.

(19) Sir William Thomson.—Thompson has published aseries of papers
sparkling with his customary briiliancy on fluid motions ; these are scat-
tered through the Philosophical Magazine, the proceedings of the societies
at London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, and the reports of the British As-
sociation. These papers will cover theoretical questions as to the sta-
bility of fluid motions, the formation of standing waves, the discontin-
uous space in the rear of an obstacle, the laminar flow of liquids, the
turbulent flow of water, and other matters bearing on atmospheric phe-
nomena. These papers have apparently been drawn out as notes for the
forthcoming third volume of his mathematical and physical papers, and
when collected will be recognized as completing our views on many
subjects.

(20) Oberbeck.—In 1882 Oberbeck published in Wiedemann’s Annalen
a mathematical development based on the correct hydrodynamie for-
mule, of the theory of horizontal atmospheric currents.

A full translation of this important memoir will be included in the
series of papers formerly referred to; but the following popular state-
nent of his results is given here as published by Oberbeck himself in
the proceedings of the second German Geographical Congress:

Starting from the generally known results of recent meteorvlogical
observations in so far as these relate to the distribution of pressure
and the direction and force of the wind, the author explains that one
of the most important problems of the mathematical theory of the
motion of fluids is to explain quantitatively the connection of the above-
named phenomena. The recently published investigations of Guldberg
and Mohn (Etudes sur les mouvements de Vatmospbere, Christiania,
1876 and 1880), are to be considered as a specially successful attempt
in this direction. It must be of interest also for the larger number of
geographers to know the most important results to which the Norwe-
gian scientists have attained.

In order to understand the horizontal movements of the atmosphere
it is important for a moment to consider their causes. As such we con-
sider the differences of pressure at the surface of the earth as observed
with the barometer. But whence do these arise? This question has
been answered a long time since. It is heat which is to be considered
as the prime cause of the disturbance of equilibrium in the atmosphere.
380 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Because of the slight conductivity of the air the process of warming can
progress only slowly from below upwards, so that, as is well known,
the temperature of the air steadily diminishes as we ascend. The
heated air expands. The pressure becomes less. If the heating takes
place uniformly over a large area there will be at first no reason for
horizontal currents. But vertical currents can certainly be brought
about by this means. If we imagine a circumscribed mass of air trans-
ported into a higher region without any increase or diminution of its
heat its temperature will sink because it has expanded itself propor-
tionately to the diminished pressure. If its temperature is then equal
to that prevailing in the upper stratum it will remain in equilibrium at
this altitude as well as below. The atmosphere in this ease exists in a
state of indifferent equilibrium. If its temperature is lower the mass
of air will again sink down; in the reverse case it willrise higher. The
air in these cases is then in stable or unstable equilibrium respectively.
In the latter case any vertical movement initiated by some accidental
disturbance will not again disappear, but rapidly assumes increasing
dimensions. The current will also continue uniform for a long time.

This is the explanation given by Espy, 1831, William Thomson, 1861,
and Reye, of Strasburg, 1868, of the ascending air currents in the whirl-
winds of the tropies.

The winds of our (temperate) zone also presuppose such ascending
currents whose origin must have been quite similar. The ascending
current is in general restricted to a definite region that we can desig-
nate as the base. Since the ascending current consists of warmer air,
therefore above this base the pressure sinks.* A barometric depression
is inaugurated there. The pressure increases from this region outward
in all directions. The isobars therefore surround the region of ascend-
ing atmospherie currents in closed curves. At greater heights the up-
per cooled air flows away to one side, and in other regions gives occa-
sion to descending currents of air. At the earth’s surface itself the air
flows towards the depression; its influence thus extends over an area
much greater than that of the base. If we neglect the curvature of the
earth’s surface over this larger area we find there simple horizontal
movements. Mathematical computations should now reveal to us the
nature of such horizontal movements. To this end all the causes of
motion or the forces that come into consideration are first to be collected
together.

The differences of pressure have already been several times spoken
of; these are measured by the gradient, and it gives for any point the
direction and amount of the greatest changein pressure. In horizontal
movements the effect of gravity can be omitted.

*Thus in the original ;—but the thoughtful reader will perceive that in this ‘ popu-
lar” presentation Oberbeck has not escaped the repetition of a popular error. The
fall of pressure, due to the warming of the air, is quite inappreciable; the okserved
barometie depression is due to cyclonic motions.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 381

On the other hand, attention must be given to the rotation of the earth
on its axis, since we are only interested in the paths of the winds on the
rotating earth. This influence can be taken account of if we imagine at
every point of the mass of air a force applied which is perpendicular to
the momentary direction of motion and is equal to the product of the
double angular velocity of the earth, the sine of the latitude, and the
velocity of the point. On the northern hemisphere this influence causes
a continuous departure of the path towards the right-hand side. Since
the movement takes place directly on the earth’s surface the direct in-
fluence of that surface, namely, the friction, remains to be considered.
Its influence diminishes with the distance from the earth’s surface. Fur-
thermore, it depends on the nature of the earth’s surface, whether sea
or lands, plains or wooded mountains. For this computation Guldberg
and Mohn have made a convenient assumption in that they introduce the
friction as a force which opposes the movement and is equal to the pro-
duct of a given factor and the velocity. This factor can have different
values according to the nature of the earth’s surface.

All these forces are to be introduced into the general equations of
motion of the air. If however one desires solutions of these general
equations for special cases there is still needed a series of assumptions.

Let there be only one single vertical current of air present. The
totality of all the atmospheric movements depending upon this one ver-
tical current is called a wind system. If the strength of the ascending
current is variable or if the basis itself changes its place then the wind
system is variable. In the first case the system stands still, in the
second case it is movable.

If, on the other hand, the ascending current of air retains its strength
and location without change, or, which is the same, if the isobars for a
long time retain their position then the wind system is invariable.

It is evident that the Jast case is by far the most simple. We will
therefore begin with its consideration.

In order to execute the calculation the location of the isobars must be
known. Even in this respect also in a preliminary way one must limit
himself at first by simple assumptions. Let the isobars be either par-
allel straight lines or concentric circles.

In the first case the computation leads to the following simple results :

(1) The parallel isobars are equally distant from each other. The
gradient is therefore everywhere of equal magnitude.

(2) The paths of the wind consist of parallel straight lines. The
strength of the wind has everywhere the same value.

(3) The direction of the wind forms an angle with the gradient whose
tangent is equal to the quotient of the factor arising from the earth’s
rotation divided by the friction-constant.

The deviation of the wind from the gradient is therefore greater in
proportion as friction is smaller. If the earth’s surface were perfectly
smooth the wind would blow in the direction of the isobars.
382 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

This result following directly from the computation and at first sur-
prising finds its confirmation in a variety of observations. For example
in England we observe a deviation of 61 degrees for land winds but of
77 degrees for sea breezes. From this it follows that the friction on
the land is more than twice as great as on the sea.

Conditions of pressure like those here considered frequently occur.
In the regions of the trade winds and monsoons they vienpre prevail
either during the whole or about half of the year.

The circular isobars to the consideration of which we now pass pro-
duce systems of wind that can be considered as the simplest types of
cyclones and anti-cyclones according as the pressure in the interior is a
minimum or maximum. We confine ourselves here to the consideration
of cyclones.

As already remarked, these are not conceivable without an ascending
current of air, whose area in our case is defined by a circle. Outside
of this horizontal movements prevail exclusively; inside of it there is
also the vertical movement to be considered. Therefore the computa-
tions for the outer and inner regions are different. In this way we ob-
tain the following results:

(1) The pressure increases from all sides outward from the center ; the
gradient increases also from the center out to the limit of the inner re-
gion; from there on it diminishes, and at a great distance becomes in-
appreciable.

(2) The wind-paths in both regions are curved lines, logarithmic
spirals, which cut the isobars everywhere at the same angle or make
everywhere the same angle with the radial gradient. Therefore the
movement of the air can be considered as consisting of a current toward
the center and a rotation around the center, the direction of the latter
is counter clock-wise. This departure from the gradient is of different
magnitudes in the outer and inner regions. For the former the de-
parture has the same value as for straight isobars, that is to say, it
depends alone upon the rotation of the earth and the friction. For
the inner region the departure is greater, and depends besides upon the
intensity of the ascending current of air. If both regions were sepa-
rated from each other by a geometrical cylindrical surface, then the
wind-paths in these would not continuously merge into each other, but
would form an angle with each other. This, of course, can never occur
in nature. We must therefore assume a transition region in which the
wind is continuously diverted from one into the other direction. At
any rate accurate and comparative observations of the wind direction
in the inner and outer region of a cyclone would be of great interest.
From these one could draw a conelusion as to the limitation of the as-
cending current of air. This limit is, moreover, also notable in that at
it the winds reach their greatest force.

There is no arrangement that has been discussed theoretically as yet,
except the straight line, circular, and nearly circular forms of the
isobars.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 383

We have as yet only spoken of the invariable systems of wind. In
fact, however, their duration is relatively short. No sooner is a depres-
sion formed than it fills itself up. Furthermore, the central region of
depression generally does not remain long in the same place, but pro-
gresses often with great velocity, drawing the whole system of winds with
it. We must look to the density of the horizontal current flowing in
toward the ascending current of air as the cause of these changes. The
system of winds remains unchanged only when, as has hitherto been
silently assumed, the temperature and density of the horizontal and
vertical currents are alike. If the inflowing air is warmer, the depres-
sion increases in depth, in the opposite case it becomes shallower.

Finally, if the inflowing air is not of the same temperature on all sides,
but is on the one side of higher and on the other side of lower tempera-
ture than the ascending air, then it will on the one side be strengthened
and its area increased, on the other side enfeebled and its area dimin-
ished. The consequence of this is that the current of air or the region
of depression moves along. The cyclone progresses. Since in the
cyclones of our zone the air entering on the east side comes from more
southern, therefore in general warmer, regions, while the air entering on
the west side comes from the north and is generally colder, therefore
the cyclone progresses from west to east or from southwest to northeast.
This is in fact the path of most cyclones in northern Europe. For a
moving cyclone the isobaric curves must have a different shape than for
astationary. Therefore one can inversely, from the shape of the isobars,
infer the direction of motion. If the region of ascending air has a cir-
cular form the computation can be rigorously executed. Without going
into the details of this interesting problem in this place, I will only re-
mark that the isobars consist of closed curves similar to an ellipse.
There is one direction from the center outwards, in which the isobars
are most crowded together, while in the opposite direction they are
furthest apart. The movement of the cyclone is in a direction at right
angles to this line. With the solution of this problem we now stand
about at the limits of what analysis has thus far accomplished. Still
there is hope that it will make further progress so far as concerns the
relations between the pressure and the motion of the air at the earth’s
surface.

(21) Oberbeck.—Oberbeck has added to his memoir of 1882 a further
investigation on the general movements of the atmosphere, which was
published in full in two communications to the Acadeny of Sciences at
Berlin in the year 1888. (See Sitzungsberichte, 1888, xtv, p. 383-395.)
On account of their importance [ have, asin his former memoirs, given a
complete translation of these in the collection of translations previously
noticed ; but to those who do not care to follow the mathematical inves-
tigation the following résumé of his results is given mostly as expressed
in a popular paper by Oberbeck himself and originally contributed by
him to the Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau of June 9, 1888,
384 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

“The systematic and successful labors of meteorological observers in
the last decade has given a series of empirical Jaws for the motion of
the air that have already become of great importance for meteorology
and for weather predictions, and promise to become still more so in the
future.

‘In general the active forces that constitute the principal causes of
these phenomena of motion have been correctly appreciated, but so far
as I know we have not yet been successful in bringing them into such
a systematic connection that we have been able to deduce therefrom a
mechanies of the atmosphere or a theory that reproduces the most im-
portant points in the phenomena of motion. However, very noteworthy
attempts in this direction have already been made by different parties.

‘The oldest investigations upon this point are due to the American
meteorologist, William Ferrel. They are contained in a large number
of memoirs, only a part of which is accessible to me; but from the
memoirs that are known to me I think I may conclude that the most
important results to which Ferrel has attained are collected together
by himself in a work recently published (Recent Advances in Mete-
orology, Washington, or Appendix 71 to the Annual Report for 1885
of the Chief Signal Officer), so that the following remarks relate to this
work:

‘‘ Ferrel starts, in reality, with the equations of motion of a free heavy
point or a small free mass, and endeavors, by the addition of further
terms, to accommodate these equations to the motion of a fluid, but
without finally attaining the correct form of the hydrodynamic equa-
tions. As effective forces he introduces the attraction of the earth, the
consideration of the differences of density of the air (in consequence of
differences of temperature), the effects resulting from the rotation of
the earth, and, finally, the resistances of friction.

‘From the general equations he derives special solutions, in which,
first, the friction is neglected, and the additional assumption is made
that the currents in the directions of the small circles (parallels of lati-
tude) materially exceed in strength or velocity the movements in the
meridian that would take place on a motionless earth, in consequence of
the differences in temperature between the tropics and the polar zones.

‘But such an assumption, in my opinion, ought not to be made with-
out further considerations. Rather is it the province of theory to dem-
onstrate its correctness, and to show for what reasons east and west
currents are stronger than the north and south currents. The com-
plete neglect of friction leads, as not otherwise to be expected, to for-
mule that make the velocity at the poles become infinitely great, whence
follows that the atmospheric pressure will there be zero. The consider-
ation of friction, as to the method of whose action no special assumption
is made, has the result of mollifying these incorrect results and accom-
modating the phenomena of motion to the recognized special distribu-
tion of pressure on the earth surface.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 385

“The motions in the atmosphere have been further treated of by C. M.
Guldberg and H. Mohn. (Studies on the Motions of the Atmosphere,
Christiania, part I, 1876, part 11, 1880.) These authors both start with
the correct hydrodynamic equations. The motions are by them directly
recorded in differences of pressure. Furthermore, the resistance is
assumed to be proportional to the velocity of the wind then prevailing.
It is very probable that this assumption is appropriate for the lowest
strata of theatmosphere. The calculations of the above-named scholars
will, therefore, lead also to results that agree with observations in gen-
eral for the movement of the air in the neighborhood of the earth’s sur-
face, especially when we carry through the computations somewhat
more accurately, as was done by me a short time ago. (See Wiede-
mann Annalen, 1882, vol. xviI, p. 128, reproduced in No. 7 of the
accompanying translations; compare also A. Sprung, ‘Treatise on
Meteorology, pp. 142-151.) On the other hand, there can certainly
be no doubt that the above-given assumption as to the nature of the
frictional resistance is entirely inappropriate for the upper strata of
air. A general comprehensive theory of cyclones, in which the upper
and the lower currents are considered, and in which, furthermore, the
fundamental cause of cyclones, namely, local differences of density in
the atmosphere, occupies the foreground, can certainly not be attained
by using the above-mentioned assumption as to resistance.

“The problem of the progressive movement of cyclones, so remarkably
important but at the same time so very difficult, can indeed only first
find a satisfactory solution when (1) the constitution of a stationary
cyclone is sufficiently well known (2) the currents in the upper strata
of the atmosphere are established with some degree of certainty.

‘The above mentioned investigations are presented in a clear and com-
_ prehensive form in the treatise on meteorology by A. Sprung, Ham-
burg, 1885.

‘‘Hspecially would I eall attention to the judgment of the author as to
W. Ferrel (page 198 and notes on pages 200 and 202), with which I
entirely agree.*

“Since that publication the motions of the atmosphere have been
treated by W. Siemens, introducing the fundamental propositions of the
conservation of energy. (Siemens, On the Conservation of Energy in
the Atmosphere of the Earth. Sitzungsberichte of the Berlin Academy,
1886, p. 261). This author, without special analytical developments,
makes the existence of strong currents in the direction of the parallels
of latitude very probable, and ascribes to them a predominant influence
on even the wind systems of the temperate zones.

*Sprung’s criticism is but little more than the opinion of a regret that Ferrel has
not fully solved the equation of continuity, but as he has adopted the special solution
that is offered by the mean distribution of temperature and pressure in the earth, |
do not see that any error has been introduced thereby.—C. A,

H. Mis, 142 25

386 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

“From all this it seemed to me worth the trouble to investigate to what
results anew treatment of the problem of atmospheric movements in the
most general analytical method would lead.

‘The starting point necessarily is the equations of motion of hydro-
dynamics, as to whose reliability, so far as is known to me, no manner of
doubt has been expressed. The ultimate cause of the movements con-
sists in differences of density of air that is subject to the attraction
of the earth.

‘¢ The influence of the rotation of the earth, according to the laws of
mechanics, can be expressed by a deviating force, so that after its intro-
duction the earth can be considered as at rest. Furthermore, frictional
forces are to be introduced, since without them the atmospheric currents
under the continuous influence of accelerating forces will attain infinitely
great velocities. The resistances opposing the atmospheric movements
in all cases consist of a series of influences of various origins, and in part
also, variable in amount. If a rapidly moving mass of fluid penetrates
into a quiet fluid it experiences a sensible resistance almost like that of
asolid body moving in the quiet fluid. If,on the other hand, a definite
portion of a fluid comes continuously under the influence of a motive force,
then ‘fluid jets” are formed, or, as they were first called by Helmholtz,
‘‘ discontinuous currents,” which glide through the quiet fluid with rela-
tively slight friction.* Two neighboring currents running parallel to
each other, with different velocities, will always affect each other in such
a way that the more rapid is retarded, the slower current is accelerated.
This interchange is much favored when between the two larger main
currents smaller side currents are produced by means of local causes,
which bring about a partial mixture of the two streams. All these
phenomena, especially that last mentioned, indicate in my judgment
that we shall take account of the most important resisting influences
if we follow the assumption first expressed by Newton, that the mutual
influence of the rapidly moving parts of a fluid is proportional to the
difference of their velocities. Hence it at once follows that a current, in
which all parts move parallel and with equal velocities, experiences in
general no friction. On the other hand, wherever currents of different
velocity occur near each other the friction has an effect which is especi-
ally strong at the boundary of the currents.

‘‘ Since I also adopt the just mentioned law of friction for the atmos-
pheric currents, I would expressly designate this as an hypothesis. I
thereby in nowise assume that the process is so simple as it is in the
experiments for the determination of the coefficient of friction, 7%. ¢.,
viscosity or internal friction, in which everything is so arranged inten-
tionally that the velocities of the fluid remain very small.

natsb., 1868. Reprinted in Helmholtz, Wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen, Vol. I, p.

DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 387

‘Hence the numerical value of the coefficient of the friction of the air
(or viscosity), as found experimentally, can in nowise be used for the
computation of the influence of friction in the atmosphere. Rather
will the number that for brevity is here called ‘friction coefficient,’ be
much larger than the above-mentioned coefficient.

“The influence of the earth’s surface on the air streaming over it can
be easily expressed according to this theory of friction. According to
the nature of the earth’s surface the neighboring particles of air are
either forced to adhere to it or else move over it with greater or less
retardation.

‘The density of the air as is well known depends upon the pressure
and the temperature. For increasing distance above the earth’s sur-
face the density diminishes rapidly, and at an altitude of 20 kilometers
it has a density of only one-tenth of that which prevails at the earth’s
surface. The consideration of this circumstance would greatly increase
the difficulty of the calculation. Ihave temporarily ignored the dimi-
nution of density at great altitudes. But in the explanation of the final
result one would have to take into consideration this point. Since as
above mentioned, the density of the air is inappreciably small at alti-
tudes which are slight in comparison with the horizontal dimensions of
the atmosphere, therefore the movements that occur at: those altitudes
can in general exert only a slight influence on the currents in the lower
stratum. We can therefore from a dynamic point of view consider the
atmosphere as bounded at a moderate altitude by a spherical surface
on which the air slides freely.

‘The calculation executed on the basis of this assumption leads to the
following result: If we imagine a definite distribution of temperature over
the earth’s surface or over a special portion of tt to continue for a long time,
then permanent currents of air exist, that can be calculated from the
distribution of temperature if it be considered as given.

‘¢ Now the contrast in temperature of the hot and cold zone is the
principal force that, with slight modifications in the different seasons
of the year, causes a system of currents that includes the greatest part
of the earth’s surface.

‘A form of expressing this distribution of temperature that is very
convenient for computation consists in the utilization of the following
expression : ‘

T=A-+B (1—3 cos? @)

In this # is the angle that the line connecting any point of the atmos-
phere with the center of the earth makes with the axis of the earth so that
90°— 4 is the geographical latitude of the point in question. Under this
assumption analysis furnishes the following values for the three com-
ponents of the currents et any point of the atmosphere, viz, V for the
vertical component taken positive upwards, N the horizontal compo-

nent taken positive toward the north, and O the horizontal component
taken as positive toward the east.

V=C (1—3 cos? 6) f
N=—6 Ccos @ sin 6. p
O=D [sin 6 (1—3 cos? 6) g+6 cos? é. y]

“Tn these expressions Jf, p, g, y are functions of the distance of the
point in question in the atmosphere above the earth’s surface. They
depend also upon the condition of the atmosphere at its two boundary
surfaces (the concentric spherical surfaces above and below). At both
these two boundary surfaces the vertical component V, and therefore
also f, must disappear. Furthermore, gy, g, y, must disappear at the
earth’s surface if we assume that there the atmosphere adheres to it.

‘The function @ is zero for a certain definite altitude—that is to say,
at this altitude the meridioual current changes its sign; below it is di-
rected toward the south, but above it is directed toward the north. The
function g is everywhere negative; the function y is everywhere posi-
tive, but always zero at the earth’s surface.

“The two constants U and D unfortunately do not admit of direct nu-
merical computation, and that for two reasons: First, the unknown
value of the friction constant for atmospheric currents enters into them.
Again, they contain the whole difference in temperature between the
equator and the pole. Butit is allowable to assume that only a certain
fractional part of this difference of temperature is the actual effective
cause of the currents, since in the higher strata the difference of tem-
perature is certainly considerably smaller:

‘‘Tn other respects the above expressions give a clear picture of the
currents. The vertical current (V) is an ascending one from the equa-
tor up to 35° 16’ north and south latitudes, but thence to the-poles it is
directed downwards. The meridional currents (N) are 0 at the equator
and at the poles; they attain their greatest value at 45° latitude.

‘‘In consequence of the earth’s rotation there arises the current O
along the circles of latitude, which consists of two branches, O, depend-
ing on the function g, and O, depending on the function y. ©, is, from
the equator to 35° 16’ north and south latitudes, directed toward the
west; there this current changes its sign, and in the higher latitudes is
easterly. Oy, represents a current directed toward the east; everywhere
at the earth’s surface it is zero (corresponding to the value of the fune-
tion y), but, on the other-hand, at higher altitudes it attains a very
considerable value. Both the movements O,; and O, along the small
circles of latitude disappear at the pole. Moreover, the current Op is
zero at the equator, and attains its greatest value at the latitudes
54° 44’ north and south. .

“We would especially call attention to the fact that these results de-
pend essentially upon the assumption as to the distribution of tempera-
ture. A change in the location of the maximum of temperature (as
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 389

for instance, its transfer into the northern hemisphere), would cause a
corresponding change of all the currents.

“The accompanying sketch, Fig. 1, gives a picture of the atmospheric
currents as they would result from the adopted distribution of tempera-
ture. This presents the earth’s surface in the Mercator projection.
The curves wand wv represent the currents of air in the lower strata;
the curves o and o in the upper strata of the atmosphere. At the
equator and at the poles the vertical
currents serve as the means of transi-
tion of the lower currents into the
upper, and vice versa. The lower
current can, under favorable circum-
stances, come to be observed at the
earth’s surface. In fact, the diagram
presents in its w curves in the tropics
the trade winds as they prevail over
the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and
also the west wind as it prevails be-
yond the fortieth degree of latitude.
From the agreementof the wind paths gate Warducauauhe:
in this diagram with those actually t
observed, the important conclusion can be drawn that in general the
currents uw and o; are of the same order of magnitude. Hence, it fol-
lows that 0, or the upper easterly current must be of materially greater
intensity than the lower currents. The upper wind paths agree in the
tropics with the anti-trade.. In higher latitudes the west wind must
principally prevail in the upper regions.

“In the very highest strata of air the currents must again diminish
in strength; this is to be concluded from the fact that the two quanti-
ties C and D contain the density of the air as a factor which enters in
its first power into C, but in its second power into D.

“To this general presentation of the currents of air the detailed com-
putation of the distribution of pressure is still lacking by this execu-
tion, perhaps some unimportant modifications of the results here com-
municated may be attained.”

(22) Oberbeck.—In his third communication on this subject (the second
of 1888), Oberbeck passes from a consideration of the motions of the at-
mosphere to that of the general distribution of pressure that results
from the movements, which themselves result from the distribution of
temperature, or more properly of density. In this case he again deals
with the hypothetical atmosphere of uniform density and depth adher-
ing to the earth but gliding under the upper layers and adopts the ap-
proximate law of temperature of the air as above given. His general
solution of the equations leads to the formula:

p=constant+m cos’?6—n cos*d.

In the southern hemisphere we have conditions that approximate
those here adopted more nearly than in the northern, and having shown
390 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

that the observed pressures agree with the preceding result, Oberbeck
then utilizes the terms m and n to separate the motions in latitude and
longitude. This process is more general than that which Ferrel ex-
ecuted in the case of the solutions given by him in 1859 in the Mathe-
matical Monthly, so that the equations can be adapted to a wide range
of constants in the law of distribution of temperature at the earth’s sur-
face. Oberbeck proceeds to apply it to the extreme seasonal change
in the atmosphere as well as to the assumed mean. The whole memoir
will be given in my selected translations.

(23) Helmholtz—In May, 1888, Helmholtz submitted to the Berlin
Academy the memoir on atmospheric movements that I have given in
full in the accompanying translations. He first shows that the results
of laboratory experiments on a small scale can not be directly applied
to larger atmospheric movements because of the fact that the inertia
and density of the masses, the forces of viscosity and gravitation, and
the linear dimensions, length, area, volume, angle and time, are not all
enlarged in the necessary ratios, so that certain results, especially vis-
cosity, become inappreciable in large natural phenomena. He then
studies the conditions of stability among masses having discontinuous
motions; thus if two ring vortices encircle the earth having different
latitudes and temperatures, stable equilibrium is possible only when
the warm ring is on the polar edge of the colder ring. If they have the
same latitude then the warmer must be above the colder. The unroll-
ing of the vortex-cylinders and rings destroys their integrity and mo-
tions, mixes their own and the surrounding air together, determines the
actual average distribution of temperature and moisture in the atmos-
phere, and is the important step in the history of all atmospheric phe-
nomena. Helmholtz announces his intention of further developing this
subject.

(24) Divo Kitao —Comparable with the elegant analysis of Helmn-
holtz and Oberbeck, and, in fact, reminding us remarkably of the work
of Kirchhoff, is the memoir by Kitao (professor of physics and mathe-
matics in the Imperial Academy of Agriculture of the University of
Tokio), entitled “ Contributions to the theory of the movement of the
terrestrial atmosphere and of whirlwind storms.”

A few years ago, Professor Kitao returned from studying in Germany,
and Japan is to be congratulated on possessing two such mathemati-
cians as Kikuchi and Kitao, the former as able a pupil of the English
school as the latter is of the German.

Kitao’s memoir is published in two parts, in vol. 1, 1887. and vol. 11,
1889, of the Journal of the College of Science of the University Tokio,
and a further continuation is promised. But for its great length his
work would have been included inthe appended collection of transla-
tions, but awaiting its completion and eventual translation I can now
only call the attention of students to this extensive analytical memoir.

(25) General treatises on fluid motion.—To complete our list of recent
works bearing directly on the mechanics of the atmosphere, we should
include a few general treatises on fluid motion that are specially worthy
of the study of meteorologists.

to expect such in the near future, judging from the introductions and
notes in recent publications by Poincaré , Boussinesq, Duhem, and
Mathieu. Our list is as follows:

IV.—THERMO-DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA.

(26) Introductory.—The application of the laws of thermo-dynamics
to the movements of the atmosphere was first made in a crude manner
by Espy and Joseph Henry before the development of this branch of
physics had been attempted by Clausius, Sir William Thomson, and
others. The memoir of Thomson in 1861; Reye, 1864 and 1872; that
of J. H. Lane (American Journal of Science and Arts, July, 1870) ; that
of Charles Chambers (see the Meteorology of the Bombay Presidency,
1878); the short paper by Hann (Z. O. G. M., 1874); the memoirs of Prof.
William Ferrel (see especially his Meteorological Researches, 1877, 1881,
1883, and his Recent Advances, 1885; those of Guldberg and Mohn,
1876-78), and the treatise of Sprung (Meteorologie, 1885), have all of
them given analytical expressions for this application of thermo-dyna-
mics, so that the whole subject of adiabatic changes should now be
familiar to all meteorologists. The works of these authors have now
been most admirably supplemented by two memoirs by Hertz and Be-
zold, respectively, who have developed graphic methods that render the
entire process of cooling and warming easy of computation and clear
of comprehension, as also very expeditious.

The memoir of Hertz is confined to the determination of adiabatic
changes, but the memoir of Bezold includes the consideration of changes
that are not strictly adiabatic, but in which the quantity of heat within
amass of air actually changes by reason of mixtures, precipitations, .
and radiations.

It is evident to the most superficial thought that the quantity of
heat within a given mass of air actually is continually in a state of
change and that too not only by reason of its gain of heat from the sun
by day and its loss by radiation at night, but especially by the process
of mixture that is continually going on. On theone hand cold and dry
392 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

airs are being mixed with warm and moist; on the other hand aqueous
vapor with latent heat is being added to the air by evaporation from
the ground, and again being taken from the air, but leaving its heat
behind by the process of formation of rain, hail, and snow. Therefore
the ascent and descent of atmospheric currents is by no means an adia-
batic process, and it is the aim of Bezold to so present graphically the
changes that take place in ascending and descending air as that we may
at any time calculate its thermal condition.

(27) Bezold.—The original memoirs of Hertz and Bezold detailing
their graphic methods in thermo-dynamies as applied to our atmosphere
will be given in full in the promised collection of translations. The
ground covered by these will be easily understood from the following
analysis of Bezold’s work by Lettry,* with slight additions by myself.

(A.) DEFINITIONS.—Let p and v be respectively the values of the vol-
ume and pressure of a unit weight, namely, a unit mass, of gas or gas-
eous vapor whose absolute temperature is T. Then according to the
law of Boyle Mariotte-Gay-Lussac and Charles, we have

Uma er ety toh eeleen (el)

Let the condition of the unit of gas be graphically represented as to
pressure and volume by the ordinate and abscissa of a point; when p
and v are given, the location of the point is known by the graphic con-
struction, but equally is the temperature T known by the equation (a);
thus the location of a point in the diagram corresponds to a definite
temperature of the gas. If the gaseous mass is maintained at a con-
stant temperature then p and v may vary continuously, only fulfilling the
condition that their product p v remains constant. The locus of the
continuous series of points thus defined is called an isotherm, and we
see that the isotherm occurring for any given temperature must be a
hyperbola with the axis p and v as its asymptotes, as in Fig. 2, where
the co-ordinate axes are rectangular and the hyperbola is equilateral.

If on the other hand the tem-

rT perature be allowed to change, but

P the original amount of heat or

thermal energy in a unit mass of

gas is forced to remain constant,

then a new relation between the

pressure and volume that can co-

exist is brought about and is defi-

nitely determined by the laws of

2o’cent. thermo-dynamics; this relation is

tocent. given by the equation,

where k and k’ are respectively the specific heat of the gas or vapor
at constant volume and again at constant pressure. If, as before, the

DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 393

co-existing p and v are made the co-ordinates of a point, the locus of the
points representing the pressure and volume for a given constant quan-
tity of heat is called the adiabatic curve for that special quantity, as is
shown in Fig. 3.

An isotherm and an adiabatic line
may beimagined passing throughany P
point whatever if the latter be con-
sidered as an indicator of a given
initial state of the gas; that is to say,

a point whose position is determined

by co-ordinates having the initial
values p,and »,. The indicator point
will follow the isotherm if we make
the condition of the gas vary while 2 colories.
maintaining a constant temperature; @ i calories.
it will follow the adiabatic if the con-
dition of the gas varies without increase or diminution of the quantity
of heat contained within it.

Hitherto in the application of the mechanical theory of heat to me-
teorology the adiabatic changes only have been considered, but Hertz
has shown how to approximately consider non-adiabatic changes, and
especially has Bezold freed himself from the adiabatic hypothesis, which
is in fact not generally realized in nature.

Dynamie cooling.—Bezold first considers the preliminary question,
Why does air cool on ascending to higher elevations? Most meteorol-
ogists explain this cooling as the transformation of molecular energy
into external work done in the expansion of the gaseous mass as if
comes under and acts against the diminished pressure of the upper re-
gions. This is correct, and it is necessary to be on our guard against
an erronecus explanation adopted by Guldberg and Mohn, to the effect
that the work done is the elevation of the gas to the higher level; this
latter explanation is not allowable, since the work of raising the gas is
really done by gravity, namely, the heavier descending air pushes up
the lighter rising gas.

Fic. 3.—Adiabatie curve.

(B.) THE DRY STAGE.—Let # be the mass of aqueous vapor (namely,
not the weight nor the tension, but strictly the mass of vapor) that is as-
sociated with a unit mass, i. e., a kilogram of dry air, and m the mass of
the mixture; then m=1+2. Note that « differs slightly from the quan-
tity of vapor in a kilogram of the mixture, which latter is the quantity
generally given in meteorological tables.

Let p, and ps be the partial pressures of the dry air and the vapor,
respectively ; the total barometric pressure will be p=p, + ps.

Let R, and Rg be the constants in equation (a) for the air and vapor;
that equation then gives for the mixed gas and vapor

pv=R,T py=aRsT p=) (iy + aRo) T. mae
S04 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Approximately, Ry =29.272 and R;=47.061 in the metric system of
units.

Comparing this with the corresponding equation for dry air, we see

that (1) contains the additional variable x, and that the thermal condi-
tion of the gas is not defined until we know p, v, and 2. Geometrically
the condition of the gas would be represented by the location of a point
in space whose co-ordinates are these three variables.
* Let pov, in Figs. 2 and 3, be called the “ plane of co-ordinates,” as
that term is used by Bezold, and let # be measured perpendicular
thereto; we have thus the necessary system of three rectangular co.or-
dinates. The value of 2 in ordinary meteorological problems is gener-
ally very small in comparison with p and v. For any given constant
value of « the indicator point, showing the thermal condition of the air,
would move in a plane parallel and very near to the plane pov. If «
is zero the equation and the curve becomes the same as for dry air.

Tsotherms.—lIf we assume that the temperature T is maintained con-
stant, then the indicator moves along an isotherm, as above described.
For a given value of # equation (1) shows that the isotherm is an equi-
lateral hyperbola precisely like that in dry air, but situated in a plane
parallel to the plane of co-ordinates. The isotherms for the same tem-
perature T and for different values of x, when projected upon the plane
pov, agree sensibly. In fact the ordinates p, and p, of the two isotherms
coriesponding to a given abscissa, v, and to the given quantities of
aqueous vapor 2, and 2, are connected by the relation

Rs T

Pi—P2a=(%1 —X2) =

Since the second member of this equation is very nearly zero, since
the values of # are generally less than 0.03, therefore the ordinates p,
and p, aresensibly equal. One may then be content to consider in the
geometrical interpretation of the facts, not the isotherms themselves,
but their approximately common projection upon the plane of co-ordi-
nates; this amounts to saying that we may consider # as constant.

The line of saturation.—The changes in the condition of the air are not
reversible, and the equation (1) holds good only for certain values of v.
In fact the fundamental condition of the dry stage is that the vapor
pressure ps Shall be rather less than the maximum pressure of the sat-
urated vapor for the temperature T. Designating this maximum press-
ure by eit is necessary that we should have

or rather by replacing ps by its value as a function of v that we should
have

that is to say

or for the limiting case

Each isotherm therefore commences only at acertain limiting point,
whose abscissa is given by the equation (3) and whose ordinate is deter-
mined by the relation found by combining equations (1) and (3) namely,

Ry,+ az Rs

(le oye
If the quantity # preserves a given constant value the isotherm con-
tinues to lie in its own plane as the temperature T varies; the limiting
point of the isotherm, as just defined, is displaced at the same time, and
describes a curve that Bezold calls the line of saturation or the line of the
dew-point. (See Fig. 4.)
This curve has its concavity
turned toward the side of positive p.

The indicator point for air in the P oe
dry stage ought therefore always to
be on the concave side of the line of
saturation; if this point passes over
to the convex side it indicates that
the dry stage has been followed by
the rain stage.

T remains constant the projections s S

various values of x sensibly agree

with each other, as we have said, at least when one draws a diagram
rather than a rigorously exact figure. On the other hand, the limit-
ing point in this common projection on the plane of co-ordinates is
not the same when we take different values of x We find, without diffi-
culty, that if 7; and v are the abscisses of the limiting points belong-

that is to say, that the abscissas of the limiting point vary propor-

Adiabatics.—The equation of an adiabatic in the dry stage is

396 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

pressure of air.and of non-saturated aqueous vapor; A=430, approxi-
mately, is the mechanical equivalent of a unit of heat. T and p per-
tain to an initial state of the air, but T; and p, to a firal state. Bezold
gives a method of constructing by points an indefinite number of
adiabatics when we know one and when we have first constructed the
system of isotherms.

In the dry stage the adiabatics are appreciably independent of a,
which is a very small quantity, and they can be regarded as sensibly
the same as the adiabaties for dry air entirely without aqueous vapor.

Résumé.—F or the dry stage the condition of the atmosphere is repre-
sented by three systems of lines that can be traced upon a diagram,
whose co-ordinates are p and v, which lines constitute a net-work inter-
secting each other over the whole plane of co-ordinates, as follows:

(1) Isotherms that are equilateral hyperbolas that depend, respectively,
upon the values of the variable parameter T, but can for a given temp-
erature be considered as independent of w,the quantity of aqueous
vapor.

(2) Lines of saturation, the position of each of which depends on the
variable parameter x. Each line of saturation divides the plane of co-
ordinates into two parts; on the concave side of this curve the dry
stage is represented, and on the convex side the wet stage.

(3) Adiabatics, which are asymptotic to the axes of p and v and inter-
sect the two preceding systems of lines; these adiabatics are sensibly
the same as those that relate to absolutely dry air.

(C.) THE RAIN STAGE.—When rain is forming let x be the quantity of
saturated vapor that is associated with one kilogram of dry air, and a’
the quantity of water as such suspended within this kilogram of dry
air; let M be the mass of the mixture; we have the equation

M=1+4 4+ 2’

Here the tension of the vapor is determined by the temperature it-
self; if e designates this tension then we have the two following equa-
tions of condition as representing the relations in this stage of rain:

4 ¢
Be By ie 01a ote Salle Nr feted eae

e=aR, = :

The following remarks may be made with regard to the rain stage:

(1) The quantity of water in suspension, «’, is always very small; for
as soon as this quantity becomes rather large the water separates from
the foggy mass and falls; therefore the changes of condition are irre-
versible. ;
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 397

(2) In general, the quantity, x, of saturated vapor can only diminish.
This quantity could increase with v if, in an exceptional case, the tem-
perature remained constant, or with T, if the volume remained the
same, but it would be necessary that the added vapor should be fur-
nished by the evaporation of the water in suspension. Now, the quan-
tity of water in suspension is very small, and this store would be quickly
exhausted. The contact of the air with moist bodies or any circum-
stance of the same class would also tend to increase the quantity of
vapor 2, but still this would be an exceptional case.

(3) The equations (6) and (7) show that when z is given it suffices to
know apy one of the quantities e, T, v, or p in order that the others may
be determined. We see also that if # is given and T varies, the indi-
cator of the condition of the air moves along the line of saturation that
is peculiar to the special value of a. %

(4) Let us suppose that at the moment when the vapor becomes sat-
urated and that one enters into the rain stage the quantity of vapor is
v,, and that at the end of a certain time this quantity is diminished to
x, The indicator was at first on the line of saturation belonging to z,,
but it now is found on the line of saturation belonging to x,. While «
has decreased from x, to x,, the indicator has passed from its initial to
its final position by cutting across all the lines of dew-point or lines of
saturation relative to the intermediate values of a.

But the indicator can not retrace its path, because x2 can not increase
in general. Therefore in the rain stage the indicator always describes
its path in the same direction. For such paths or trajectories, described
in the given direction, one can apply the principles of thermo-dynamics
as if reversible changes were under consideration. Therefore the
changes of condition in the case of rain can be described as * partially
reversible.”

Isotherms.—As the tension e of saturated vapor is constant so long
as the temperature T is constant, and as on the other hand « can only
decrease, the equation (7) shows that v can only decrease if T does not
change. This being allowed, the equation (6) will be the equation
of the isotherm for a given temperature, T, and for decreasing values
of v and of x The isotherm remains entirely throughout its whole ex-
tent on the convex side of the line of saturation belonging to «,, the
initial value of a.

We see that the isotherm in the rain stage is still an equilateral
hyperbola, and that it varies very little from the isotherm of the dry
stage for the same temperature.

Adiabatics.—Strictly speaking there is no adiabatic, unless we sup-
pose that all the condensed water remains in suspension. If all or a
part of the water falls to the ground there is an exterior work per-
_ formed, and consequently a loss of internal heat or calorific energy,
and the definition of the adiabatic no longer applies,
398 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

If we assume that all the water formed by condensation continues in
suspension, we have for the differential equation of the adiabatic

where c, designates the specific heat of the air at a constant volume,
x, is the quantity of aqueous vapor at the moment when the rain stage
begins, vis the quantity of aqueous vapor at any given moment during
the rain stage, r is the latent heat of vaporization or quantity of heat
required to vaporize a unit mass of water at the temperature T, and the
pressure p or approximately, 606 at 0° C and varying with the tempera-
ture; A and R,, known constants, as before used. We have moreover
v,=v+u', where wv designates the mass of condensed water that re-
mains in suspension. Wecould have given another form to the preced-
ing equation by choosing as variables p and T in place of v and T.

Integration furnishes the equation of the adiabatic under a finite
form. If we pass from an initial condition designated by the subscript
1 to a final condition designated by the subscript 2 the equation of the
adiabatic is

Pseudo-adiabatic.—When the condensed water is separated wholly or
in part from the mass of air, exterior work is done, and consequently
there is a loss of heat. The changes of condition in this case are called
pseudo-adiabatic by Bezold. He gives this name especially to the curve
described by the indicator when all the water that is formed falls to
the ground without increasing the energy of the mass of gas and with-
out other loss than that just mentioned ; actually the fall of rain does
communicate some energy to the air.

The differential equation of the pseudo-adiabatic is

This equation is He Gs eis of x, or the quantity of saturated vapor
that existed at the moment when the rain stage began; it is also inde-
pendent of the quantity of water formed, and consequently on our
hypothesis, fallen to the ground since the beginning of the rain stage.
In equation (10) x represents the quantity of saturated vapor that exists
at any given moment.

remark that in the third term the integral is here present only as a cor-
rection whose value is comprised between very small limits. By com-
paring the adiabatic and the pseudo-adiabatic that start from the same
initial point we find that this latter curve is the one that most rapidly
approaches the axis of v.

(D.) 1HE SNOW STAGE AND THE HAIL STAGE.—These are treated by
Bezold in a manner entirely similar to the preceding. He gives the
following examples of application of his methods.

(A) Foehn.—In the Foehn, moist air expanding by ascending the
sides of a mountain is then compressed when it descends upon the other
slope, all without any addition or diminution of its heat. The curves
representing these changes of condition are therefore adiabatics.

In Fig. 5, let a be the position
of the indicator for the condition 7; 5 Za
corresponding to the initial con-
dition; SaSa the corresponding
line of saturation; as the air ex-
pands the indicator moves cor-
respondingly along the adiabatic
ab down to the point b, where this
eurve reaches the line of satura-
tion Sa. The are ab is located
really in a plane parallel to the
plane pov of the diagram, and ata
distance from this plane equal to @
the mass x, of the vapor of water Fic. 5.—Adiabatics.
that accompanies 1 kilogram of the dry air.

From a to b the adiabatic crosses a series of isotherms, of which the
first one only, namely, the dotted line Ta Ta is traced in the diagram, and
we see that the temperature has fallen continuously. At the moment
when the indicator cuts the line of saturation at b the dry stage ceases
and the rain stage begins. The adiabatic ab is now continued by the
pseudo-adiabatic be, which represents the rain stage.

The air does not now cease to expand, but the temperature falls more
slowly ; this is why the curve dc is less steeply inclined to the axis ov and
intersects continually the lines of saturation for quantities of aqueous
vapor that are steadily diminishing.

However, the air arrives at the summit of the mountain and crosses
it and the compression begins; at this moment the indicator of the con-
dition of the air is atc. Then we have the following alterpatives:

(1) All the water that is formed remains in suspension; in this case
be is a true adiabatic, and here the change of condition of-the air is
completely reversible. The indicator returns from e to } in the rain
stage, and then from b to ain the dry stage. We find the same con-
ditions as to temperature, volume, and pressure, on either side of the
mountain. This case of complete reversibility always occurs when the

400 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

line of saturation has not been attained ; that is to say, when the changes
have occurred entirely within the dry stage.

(2) Or, on the other hand, and which generally happens, the water
that is formed as the indicator passes below 4 is separated from the rest
of the mass by falling to or towards the earth, and be is a pseudo-adi-
abatic; in this case the change is irreversible, and as the air descends
along the opposite slope of the mountain the indicator follows a curve
cd other than be, or the adiabatic of the dry stage.

We see by the consideration of Fig. 5, that the initial temperature
will be recovered at a pressure lower than the initial pressure ; that the
temperatures that are attained become higher and higher, and the ex-
cess over the former becomes greater in proportion as the air descends
and is compressed.

Moreover, the absolute quantity of the aqueous vapor has become
smaller, therefore the real line parallel to the plane pov, and of which
ed is the projection, is now much nearer to this plane than was the orig-
inal line ab. Z

Thus we have cold and moist air on one side of the mountain becom-
ing warm and dry air on the other. Thus we derive all the character-
istic properties of the Foehn, and explain without difficulty how it is
that these properties do not pertain to descending winds that have not
first surmounted a summit, for example, to the winds that simply de-
scend along the slope of a plateau.

(B) Interchange of air between a cyclone and anti-cyclone, in the sum-
mer.—The changes of condition of air within a cyclone and anti-cyclone
are analogous to those of air that has surmounted a mountain ridge.
Rain within the area of a cyclone, dry weather in a clear sky within an
anti-cyclone. But whereas, in the case of the Foehn, these changes are
experienced within an area of small diameter, so that one can neglect
external thermal actions; the passage from the cyclonic state to the
anti-cyclonic is, on the contrary, effected within a space so extended
that it is necessary to take account of these actions.

In summer the addition of solar heat is the prevailing power; in
winter it is the reverse; the day-time and the night time have influences
very nearly like those of summer and winter. In all cases the curves
representing the condition are no longer adiabatic.

Let us suppose that the air passes from the cyclonic to the anti-cy-
clonic condition in the summer time. Starting from an initial condition
a in the cyclone, the temperature diminishes by expansion and the indi-
cator of the condition of this mass of air starts to describe the adia- .
batic ab!, but the diminution of temperature is retarded by the addition
of external heat and the air expands, as shown by the movement of the
indicator along the curve ab, which is less inclined than the adiabatic
ab’, It follows that the line of saturation is attained later than it other-
wise would be, and this corresponds to a higher elevation above the
surface of the earth of the mass of air under consideration. (See Fig. 6.)
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 401

In the rain stage the curve be of the change of condition is also less
inclined than the adiabatic bc'; at the same time it remains nearer to
the line of saturation. While traversing
the line bc the condensed vapor is form-
ing clouds.

If the addition of external heat con-
tinues, the air can even return to the
dry stage along the curve cd; let c be
this point where this occurs; the point
e will at the same time be the upper
limit of the lower clouds.

From } to ¢ the absorptive power of
the suspended water renders the warm-
ing by insolation relatively large. But 0? ans V
when one has entered into the dry stage, ee
beyond the point d, the absorptive power of the atmosphere diminishes ;
however, the expansion continues, and with the expansion the cooling,
and at some point @, which corresponds to the height of the cirrus
clouds, we enter into the snow stage. The absorption of heat, as we
go from c to d, has become so feeble that the line ed can be considered
as an adiabatic. From d to 2 we continue in the snow stage or
the cirrus-cloud stage. At 2 the air begins to descend in the anti-
cyclone

During the first portion of the period of compression the air follows
a curve 2f, corresponding very nearly to the adiabatic 2/1 of the dry
stage, but departing from it always alittle toward the higher isotherms,
in proportion as we descend to the lower altitudes, where there exists
an euergetic absorption of heat.

The final pressure at the point f at the base of the anti-cyclone is
greater than the initial pressure at the point @ at the base of the cyclone.
Moreover, it generally happens that the point / is situated to the right
of the point a, that is to say, that v is larger than »v,, or that the air in
an anti-cyclone is specifically lighter than in a eyelone. This results
from the fact that the addition of external heat compensates for the in-
fluence of compression.

If the air, descending in the anti-cyclone, encounters a new depres-
sion, this is represented in the diagram by the dotted line fa, supposing
everything else to be the same in the old and in the new cyclone. The
line fa completes the cycie of the changes of condition.

(C) Interchanges of air between a cyclone and anti-cyclone, in winter.—
We note at first that the curves of the changes of condition more nearly
approach the axes of co-ordinates in winter than in the summer, since
the temperatures remain relatively low and the higher isotherms are not
attained. At the initial point a the pressure is lower and the tempera-
ture higher ; at the final point d the pressure is higher and the tempera-
ture lower. The point dis therefore to the left and above the point a.

402 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Moreover, the curves of condition are in winter nearer the plane pov
than in summer, because in winter the absolute quantity of aqueous
vapor contained in the air is always smaller.

When the air rises in the cyclone, starting from the initial condition a,
the indicator-point very nearly follows the adiabatic until it attains the
upper limit of the mass of clouds; in fact, below this limit the insolation
and the radiation can produce only inappreciable effects. As for the
rest, in so far as the curve departs from the adiabatic, it approaches the
axes, contrary to what happens in the summer time.

In the accompanying diagram, Fig.
7, abe is the curve of conditions from
the initial point a up to the moment
when the compression begins. We
have supposed that the initial mass
passes immediately from the dry stage
ab to the snow stage be,

It is probable that at high altitudes
the compression of the descending air
proceeds adiabatically, according to
the adiabatic of the dry stage; but
nearer the ground the radiation causes
a deviation toward the co-ordinate
axis ov. Thus one obtains a curve somewhat analogous to ed in Fig.
7. The curve ed is only a graphic representation of the well-known
fact that there is an inversion in the vertical distribution of tempera-
ture during clear days in winter.

Near d the curve approaches the line of saturation, so that it may
even intersect it; this case corresponds to the formation of fog at the
surface of the eronnds

Numerical data are wanting to determine whether the passage from
ce to d can be made in any other manner, as when the cooling exerts its
action near the point c. The curve of condition in the plane pov would
then possess a double point.

These examples suffice to enable us to judge of the usefulness of this
graphic method, devised by Bezold, and of which, as he says, when per-
fected from a mathematical point of view, this method will give an ex-
cellent means of discussing the numerical data furnished by observa-
tion ; it will at the same time make known in what direction other ob-
servations are to be sought to the greater profit of dynamic meteorology.

In his second memoir of November, 1888, Bezold adopts the term,
‘potential temperatures” as equivalent to Helmholtz’s expression
“thermal contents,” and as the term has been applied by the latter it
will, we hope, obtain general use, although it is perhaps objectionable,
as involving a new modification of the much used word potential. The
‘potential temperature” is simply the absolute temperature that a
body would assume if it were brought to a normal pressure without
loss or gain of heat.

Fic. 7.—Adiabaties.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 403

Adiabatic or pseudo-adiabatic changes of free air that do not involve
evaporation either leave the potential temperature unchanged or increase
it, but never diminish it. Bezold uses the term to simplify the state-
ment of theorems in atmospheric circulation.

V.—PREDICTION OF STORMS AND WEATHER.

(28) Abbe.—In 1871 the present writer prepared a short sketch of
views held by himself and other meteorologists with reference to the
laws of storms and methods of weather predictions. Three editions of
this sketch were published by the Signal Office under the title of ‘Sug-
gestions as to the Practical Use of Meteorological Reports and Weather
Maps.” <A fourth edition, under the title of “‘How to Use Weather
Maps,” was prepared in 1883 and printed without charts in 1884, but
has not yet been published, and will be replaced by a more recent re-
port compiled at the request of General Greely as chief signal officer.
As a popular presentation of most of the principles that underlie a
philosophical system of weather predictions the last chapter of the
work, as printed in 1884, is perhaps worthy of the attention of the
reader, and a rather full synopsis of it is here given, so that the course
of the entire argument may be seen. This chapter is entitled ‘The
Prediction of Storms and the Weather by the use of daily Weather
Maps.”

The weather maps first prepared at the Signal Office were based upon
observations taken simultaneously at 7:35 A. M., 4:35 and 11:35 P. M.,
subsequently these hours were changed to 7 A. M.,3 P. M., and 11 P. M.,
Washington time; after the introduction of standard seventy-fifth meri-
dian time the hours were 7, 3, and 10 standard time. Since July, 1888,
they have been 8 A. M. and 8 P.M. standard time. The present remarks
refer to the earlier series, but are very nearly applicable to the others.

The early morning map gives the condition of the atmosphere at a
moment of almost perfect repose, so far as concerns the disturbing in-
fluence of the direct radiation of the sun.

The mid-day map gives the condition at the moment when this dis-
turbing influence is nearly at its maximum. The evening map is, as it
were, an instantaneous photograph of the condition of the atmosphere
while it is rapidly quieting down during the absence of the sun.

Were there no heat received from the sun the whole atmosphere, with
the land and the ocean, would rapidly cool off, moisture would con-
dense, winds would cease, except possibly very gentle currents, and tne
prediction of the weather would be re luced to the simplicity of a per-
fect uniformity. The first step in the problem of weather prediction
therefore is to determine the nature and amount of the disturbing in-
fluences exerted from day to day by the heat of the sun, which latter is
the sole ultimate cause of the origin and motion of storms.

(1) Insolation.—The solar radiation received at any station varies in
intensity with the season and the hour of the day, depending slightly
A404 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

on the distance of the earth from the sun, but principally on the appar-
ent solar altitude above the horizon and on the length of the day. The
relative number of units of heat received by a horizontal surface, at the
outer surface of the atmosphere, in the course of twe::ty-four hours is
shown for each month and each latitude either graphically or in the
numerical table No. 1, which is here omitted as not necessary to this
abstract of the course of the argument.

The relative number of units of heat received at the outer surface of
the atmosphere during an entire year is shown by a similar Table No.
11. According to Pouillet the total amount of solar heat received an-
nually at the outer surface of the atmosphere is equivalent to 231,675
calories per square centimeter, or an amount of heat that would melt a
layer of ice 30.89 meters thick, or evaporate into vapor a layer of water
about 4 meters deep, having a temperature of 5° C. (45° F.), or 3.9
meters, having a temperature of 27° C. (80° F.). The most recent
measures make the solar radiation about 20 per cent. larger than this.

The relative amounts of solar heat received at the outer surface of
the atmosphere for the intervals between the three moments for which
the Signal Service tri-daily weather maps are made up, are given in the
numerical table, 111, and are also graphically shown on charts by lines
of equal amounts of solar heat received at all parts of the earth.

(Il) The results of insolation.—The effects of solar heat before and
after it reaches the earth’s surface are analyzed as follows:

A portion is (1) directly and selectively absorbed in its passage
through the earth’s atmosphere to the surface of the earth, or to the
upper surface of a layer of fog or clouds, and does molecular work in
the air and vapor; the remaining portion passes directly, or after diffuse
reflection, finally to the earth’s surface, and either (2) evaporates moist-
ure from the sarfaces of the ocean, earth, clouds, leaves of plants, ete.,
or (3) it heats up these latter and all other bodies, which, in turn com-
muunicate the greater part of their heat by convection (4) and radiation
(5) to the adjacent air, although (6) a little is conducted down to a depth
of 50 or 100 feet, whence it returns subsequently. We will consider
these in detail.

(1) Atmospheric absorption.—When the sun is near the zenith, about
25 per cent. (according to Pouillet) of the energy in its vertical rays is
absorbed by the atmosphere before it reaches the earth’s surface—the
quantity absorbed is less in proportion as the air is purer and lighter,
and on the clearest days, at the summit of mountains 15,000 feet high,
the zenithal absorption is only about 20 per cent.; the difference is the
quantity absorbed in the lowest portion of our atmosphere, and which
is largely utilized in preventing the condensation of invisible aqueous
vapor. The researches of Langley indicate that much more than 25 per
cent. is absorbed by the atmosphere, that percentage applying only to
the rays that more easily penetrate the air, and that possibly as much
as 50 per cent. is the total absorption, as was indicated by Forbes in 1842.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 405

According to Pouillet (Paris, Comptes Rendus, 1838, tome vir, pp.
24-65), a surface of 1 square centimeter exposed perpendicularly to the
sun’s rays at the outer limit of the atmosphere receives 0.0017633 eal-
orie per minute (this calorie being the amount of heat required to raise
1 kilogram of water 1° C.). The same plate at the earth’s surface
and with the sun in the zenith would, owing to the absorption by the
atmosphere, receive only 0.76 of the above, or 0.0013401 calorie per
minute.

(This is the result of observation on six very clear days in 183738,
but observations by others have generally shown a higher value for the
amount of heat originally incident on the outer surface of the atmos-
phere.)

Adopting 25 instead of 24 per cent.as an approximation to the ab-
sorption by our atmosphere in the clearest weather, when the sun is in
the zenith, it has been shown that of the total heat received by the
illuminated half of the earth and atmosphere, about 40 per cent. is
absorbed by the air, and about 60 per cent. reaches the surface of the
earth; this latter is the average percentage for the whole illuminated
disk whose border receives at the earth’s surface no transmitted heat,
but whose center receives 75 per cent. of that incident on the outer at-
mosphere.

Therefore, in order to know the distribution over the earth’s surface
of the heat that penetrates the atmosphere, we must subtract this large
absorption from the figures in Tables I, 11, and 111 (omitted here for
brevity, but easily found in Meech, Angot, Radau, Hennessy, and other
authorities), and thus obtain the results given in Tables Ivy, v, and V1,
as follows:

(2) Evaporation.—The quantity of moisture evaporated throughout
the whole globe must be equivalent to the total precipitation of rain,
snow, ete., otherwise there would be a steady increase or diminution
instead of the present condition of approximate equilibrium; but the
local variations and irregularities in the distribution of this moisture
are very great, and constitute a secondary cause of the periodical, diur-
nal, annual, and secular changes, variations in the weather, and espe-
cially of the non-periodical variations or the so-called storms, droughts,
ete. The periodical changes in the evaporation are roughly indicated
by the figuresin Table vil. (Omitted.)

The Table vil, however, relates only to average periodica! effects. In
order to compute the special cases of evaporation that are particularly
interesting in the study of the daily weather map recourse must be had
to the formula of Weilenmann, or to its modifications by Stelling, and
more recently by Fitzgerald or to the observations by Russell.

It is very important to keep in mind the relative amounts of evapo.
ration going on in all portions of the country, and it is recommended
to enter upon various portions of the weather map, on the scale of 10
~ or 100, some number expressing in a general way the probable relative
activity during the coming twenty-four hours. Inthe compilation of
such a set of numbers Tables VI, VIII, IX, X, X11 (omitted) are furnished
as helps to a rapid approximation.

(3) Absorption; (4) Convection; (5) Radiation; (6) Conduction.—The

either by convection or radiation into the atmosphere from the earth’s
surface will vary with the nature of that surface; the relative quan-
tities are roughly expressed in a numerical table (X11).

The relative amounts of heat that reach the earth’s surface will de-
pend upon the percentage of cloudiness and the altitude of the sun some-
what as given in a numerical table (X1v).

(III) Resulting density of the air—By a combination of the numbers
given in the preceding tables and charts there may, in a rough way, be
indicated by relative numbers written upon the tri-daily maps what it
is expected will be the amount of heat and moisture added to any region
of the lower atmosphere during the interval between any two weather
charts. The effect of this heat and moisture is to forcibly alter the den-
sity of the atmosphere, hot or moist air being lighter than cold or dry
air, assuming, of course, the barometric pressure to be the same in both
cases. These relative densities are shown in the Table xy, for per-
fectly dry air (relative humidity, 0) and for perfectly saturated air (rel-
ative humidity 100).

By means of Table xv one is able finally to construct a map showing
relative densities of the lower or surface air over the United States
during the next eight or twenty-four hours. After much experience
one becomes able to make a rapid general mental summary of these
diverse influences without the labor of recording the items upon the
daily maps, and this is practically the method followed in daily routine
work.

Now, the normal distribution of density is that on which the general
movements of the atmosphere depend, and the deviations shown by the
above map of densities will give aclue to the new disturbances that will
perhaps be initiated during the day. The normal distribution of tem-
perature, pressure, and winds is shown by the monthly and annual
maps. (Omitted.) Similar charts should be constructed for both hem-
ispheres when studying international meteorology.

The Table xv, just explained, shows that the relative density of the
atmosphere is much more likely to be disturbed by changes of tempera-
ture than of moisture; thus at 70° of temperature an increase of tem-
perature by 10° diminishes the density 0.018, while at the same tempera-
ture an increase of moisture up to full saturation of the atmosphere
diminishes the density 0.008. An abnormal change of temperature is
therefore to be carefully looked for as a cause of further disturbance,
but after a disturbance is once set up the moisture becomes the most
important consideration, since its condensation alters the vertical dis-
tribution of temperature.

(IV) Wind, Friction, and Pressure.—The general distribution of den-
sity over the earth’s surface determines the flow of the denser air of the
polar regions toward and under the lighter air_of the equator, and Pro-
fessor Ferrel has shown that from this (and the rotation of the earth on
its axis) results the general distribution of pressure prevailing through-
408 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

out the atmosphere. ‘This distribution is very much affected by the
presence of oceans, continents, mountain ranges, and plateaus which
determine the irregular distribution of density and the irregular resist-
ances to the winds. Were the coefficient of friction uniform throughout
the whoie of the earth’s surface the distribution of winds and pressure
would be much simpler, but as affected by friction it is complicated, as
is Shown by the isobars on the charts of monthly mean values.

As the elevations throughout the United States must therefore be
carefully borne in mind, because of their bearing on the question of their
resistances to the motions of the atmosphere, and still more for the
thermo-dynamic reasons shown further on, therefore a hypsometric
map is provided. On this map may be introduced relative numbers,
changing with the seasons, showing the local frictional resistance at a
standard altitude, or the relative drag of the air blowing over different
surfaces; approximate estimates of these numbers are given in the
Table XVI.

The increase of wind velocities at various moderate heights above
fields of grass, grain, etc., is given by Stevenson and by Archibald, and
may be assumed to be as the square root of the altitude.

Any departure from the normal densities must be followed by a dis-
turbance in the flow of air from the denser toward the lighter.

This disturbed movement of the air produces at once a change in the
distribution of barometrie pressure, which change becomes greater in
proportion to the movement; the observed barometric changes are thus
principally dependent upon the wind, and in daily predictions it is con-
venient to use the barometer as an index of what movements are going
on in the atmosphere in the absence of observations of temperature
and winds above or beyond the limits of our stations.

The relations between pressure and wind are given in Professor Fer-
rel’s works, as also in those of Oberbeck and Guldberg and Mohn, from
which it will be seen that a very slight difference of pressure produced
by a very slight difference of density is sufficient to set the atmosphere
in motion in the direction of an ‘initial gradient,” the result of which
is immediately to produce a vorticose motion and a steeper ‘ barometric
gradient” nearly perpendicular to the initial gradient and to the mo-
tion of the wind; these steep gradients accompany all storms, and are
exemplified in Ferrel’s ‘‘ Movements on the Surface of the Earth,” 1858,
‘Meteorological Researches, part 0,” 1877, and ‘“‘ Recent Advances,”
1886,

The resistances to the motion of the atmosphere would, however, soon
bring it to rest, and the abnormal isobars would soon disappear or re-
lapse into the normal ones, were there not some force at work maintain-
ing the disturbance of density and the abnormal motions. A success-
ful storm prediction must depend upon the accuracy with which one
can determine the amount, location, and effects of the force that main-
tains this disturbance.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 409

(V) The disturbing force.—The disturbing force is recognized as the
solar heat, either directly absorbed by the air or evolved by the con-
densation of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere; the former has already
been considered and the latter must now be studied. This involves
(1) the amount of aqueous vapor and (2) its condensation.

(1) Amount of vapor.—The normal distribution of vapor in the at-
mosphere at sea-level is suggested by the hygrometric table (xvu),
which in its three sections, a,b, and ¢c, gives the monthly normal values
of the mean dew-point, the mean weight, and tension of vapor for a few
stations in North America.

Knowing the temperature of the dew-point, one can determine the
weight of the vapor contained in any volume of air, and also the ten-
sion of the vapor by the use of the accompanying table, XVIII:

The geographical distribution of moisture at the earth’s surface is
best shown by charts of lines of equal tension or dew-poiut. A com-
parison of such hygrometric charts for each of the daily reports shows
the presence of regions where moisture is in excess or is deficient, and
where a given cooling will produce precipitation.

The total amount of moisture present at any moment in a column of
saturated air extending from sea-level up to the altitude of 6,000, 12,000,
ete., feet is found from the numbers given in the preceding table, and
is expressed in the following table, by the depth in inches of the corre-
sponding layer of water that would be formed if all the moisture in such
column were to fall to the earth as rain:

Besides the observation of local dew-point, the amount of moisture in
the whole layer of air above us can perhaps be directly determined, as
per example, by means of the spectroscope or the cyanometer, at each
station; but as these observations have not as yet been reduced to a
system the Signal Service makes use of what is called a sunset obser-
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 411

vation, that is to say, the appearance of the sky at sunset is recorded
as yellow, red, or green. These sky colors vary with the changing
amounts of moisture through which the sun’s rays pass. From these
appearances an observer can form an estimate of the general hygre-
mnetric condition of large tracts of the atmosphere.

(2) Condensation of vapor—When a mass of air, whether dry or
moist, is, on account of its relative lightness, lifted up by the pressure
of the surrounding denser atmosphere, or is drawn up by any abnor-
mal diminution of the pressure above, or is pushed up the incline of a
mountain or plateau, it is raised into a region where the barometric
pressure is less than in its initial position. Consequently the rising
mass must expand to an extent proportional to the diminution of press-
ure. In this expansion a great amount of both internal and external
work is done, corresponding, respectively, with the increased separation
of the gaseous molecules and the pushing aside of surrounding air;
this work is done at the expense of the internal heat of the rising air,
consequently the whole expanding mass of mixed air and vapor grows
cooler as it rises.

The cooling process is known as a dynamic cooling, and takes place
uniformly and simultaneously throughout the whole rising mass of air.
It is a very different process from the much slower processes of cooling
by radiation or by convection. For dry air the rate of dynamic cooling
is almost the same for all pressures and temperatures, and is approxi-
mately 1° C. for every 100 meters of ascent or 1° Fahr. for 180.5 feet;
for moist air the rate of diminution of temperature is a little slower,
but the above value may also be used for it so long as no moisture is
condensed, that is to say, so long as the temperature does not fall be-
low the dew-point.

From the preceding it follows that the elevation above the ground
at which cloud or haze begins to be formed depends primarily upon the
depression of the dew-point of the rising air below its temperature at
the time when it starts from the ground.

The third column of Table xxi gives an idea of this relation be-
tween altitude and temperature.

Conversely, when the air is drawn or forced down from the upper
regions it comes under greater pressure and is compressed and warmed
at the same rate as above, namely, 1° Fahr. for 180.5 feet or 0.°55
Fahr. for 100 feet. But this latter warming (like the preceding cool-
ing) is so largely affected by radiation of heat, absorption of solar heat,
the mixing with air that has a different temperature, and by the absorp-
tion of heat in the process that is the reverse of condensation, 7. e., that
of evaporating fog and other forms of water, that the actual average
rate of cooling, as we ascend in the air, is barely one-half of the above,
a. é., 0.933 Fahr. per 100 feet or 0.96 C. per 100 meters.

The fourth column in Table xxir shows the elevation at which haze
or cloud begins to be formed by the actual observed rate of cooling in
an ascending mass, the initial depression of whose dew-point is known.
Conversely, if we actually observe the height to which a mass of air
has ascended, when it begins to become hazy or cloudy, we can from this
last column deduce, at least approximately, the corresponding depres-
sion of the dew-point that obtained at its place of starting.

The cooling by ascension is therefore not a truly adiabatic process.
Espy’s rule of an ascent of 100 yards for each degree of depression of
the dew point is thus seen to be a close approximation.

As soon as the dew-point is reached in this process of ascension and
cooling the condensation of vapor is accompanied by evolution of the
latent heat of steam, that is to say, of the enormous amount of heat
originally required to convert the water into invisible vapor, and which
has been carried from the surface of the earth up into the cloud region,
where it is now ready to be set free.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 413

This evolution of Jatent heat without wholly checking the rate at
which the ascending air is cooling, diminishes its rate nearly in propor-
tion to the amount of vapor condensed ; therefore the interior of a cloud
is warmer and lighter than the interior of a corresponding wass of clear
dry air that has attained the same level. The rate at which the tem-
perature diminishes within a mass of ascending, expanding and con-
densing, saturated air, such as that of which clouds are composed, de-
pends almost wholly on thermo-dynamie adiabatic conditions, and is
shown in the following table (xx11), by Hann, for various initial
pressures and temperatures :

NotTe.—The approximate altitudes in feet are computed on the assumption of 50° Fahr. as the
average temperature of the air column.

Thus we see for instance, that with a dew-point of 32° Fahr. the foggy
air, which near sea-level cools 3°.5 for 1,000 feet of ascent, will, when it
becomes a cloud at an elevation of about 15,500 feet or when the press-
ure is about 17 inches, be cooliug at the rate of 2°.8 per 1,000 feet, and,
in general, the higher the saturated air ascends the slower it cools. So
far, then, as concerns this important cause the ascent of moist currents
would continue indefinitely, but the continued loss of water by its fall
as rain, and the more rapid loss of heat by surface radiation at the
higher altitudes, or the absorption of solar heat by the clouds probably
determines the limiting form and the height of the outer or upper sur-
face of the clouds.

The average altitudes at which these clouds are respectively formed
may be approximated from the following table (xxiv), for Berlin, by

In addition to the intrinsic lightness and ascensive power of every
cloud, due to its internal moisture and heat, another powerful external
influence comes into play. It has been before said that about 85 per
cent. of the radiated solar heat penetrates the atmosphere to within
15,000 feet of the earth’s surface. But no appreciable part of this is
able to penetrate through a thick layer of cloud or fog. ‘Consequently
all the heat that falls upon the top of a cloud is retained therein instead
of reaching the earth’s surface, and, both by evaporating the particles
of vapor and by warming the adjacent air, contributes powerfully to
diminish the specifie gravity of the cloud as a whole, increasing the up-
draft and disturbing the vertical distribution of heat in the atmosphere.
The maximum temperature thus communicated to the top of a cloud is
not far from the maximum temperature attainable anywhere at the sur-
face of the earth.

(VI) Special suggestions.—It will therefore be seen that invisible aque-
ous vapor disturbs the equilibrium of the atmosphere in the following
three ways:

(1) By its evaporation and subsequent distribution throughout the
air it renders the atmosphere, over certain geographical sections, spe-
cifically lighter than others.

(2) By its condensation into fog or clouds and rain or snow it transfers
to distant regions the heat that had been accumulating in each particle
before its evaporation at the earth’s surface.

(3) In the form of fog or cloud it causes to be retained, at the upper
surface of the cloud, the total amount of heat that would otherwise
reach the earth, thus increasing the up-draft within a cloud, but dimin-
ishing the evaporation at the earth’s surface, by which the clouds are
supplied with moisture.
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. : 415

A philosophical prediction as to the origin, development, and move-
ment of a storm must take account of the three items above, but in the
rapid approximate-work of the Signal Service indication-room there is
need to avoid tables and calculations as much as possible and to seek
to obtain from direct observations such indications as they will give.

The first item is already provided for in the maps showing dew-point
and relative humidity. With regard to the second item, the study of the
clouds and fog, the past and the prevalent rainfall, the weather, and
daily range of temperature from maximum to minimum give indications
as to the extent of the process of condensation at any moment, and the
evolution of heat dependent thereon, and the student is guided by con-
siderations such as the following:

(a) Fog at the earth’s surface bespeaks clear dry air above, free from
cloud or haze, through which radiation is taking place rapidly ; hence it
implies the absence of uprising convective currents; hence also the gen-
eral prevalence of a stable equilibrium as regards vertical temperature
gradient. The time of day at which the fog breaks up under the solar
radiation indicates the thickness of the layer.

(b) Clear weather followed by cirrus clouds, increasing in quantity at
the successive reports, and these again followed by small cumuli, indi-
cate the advance of overlying areas of moist air or a steadily increas-
ing amount of moisture that is being locally carried up into the air.
These clouds are soon followed by larger cumuli, and these by rain and
storm centers.

(c) The range of temperature between 11 P. M. and the morning mini-
mum (or in lieu thereof an early observation) has its maximum when
radiation takes place uninterruptedly through a clear dry atmosphere,
and diminishes in proportion as moisture, haze, and cloudiness increase.
If therefore we make allowance for the effect of the wind in bringing
to the thermometer warm or cold air we shall find this range of tem-
perature a valuable index to the condition of the mass of air overhead.
In place of this indirect process of reasoning, it is probable that direct
observations, with proper apparatus, of the intensity of radiation would
give better results.

(d) The slightest formation of haze ina clear sky in the evening
proves that the upper layers are cooling to their dew-point. Fre-
quently the 11 Pp. M. observations will give such indications as show that
before 7 A.M. the sky will probably be covered with cloud, and possibly
followed by rain or snow. This cooling is partly due to radiation, as
the vapor is a good radiator, but it is also frequently due to a dynainical
cooling of rising air currents flowing toward a distant area of low press-
ure. As soon as clouds form, the air beneath ceases to cool by radia-
tion and the area that was clear at 11 P. M. is, by sunrise, covered by
a layer of cloud that protects the warm air, whose buoyancy increases
during the day and specially favors the formation of a local new storm
center. In this way many centers originate within a few hours in Mary-
416 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 18838.

land, Virginia, and North Carolina in the early morning following a
clear evening.

(e) A report of rain or snow-fall during any interval indicates that
the process of cloud formation has gone on to its extreme limit; the
quantity of rain is an index to the relative amounts of latent heat tem-
porarily left behind in the cloud stratum to be slowly lost by radiation ;
hence it shows the disturbance over different parts of the country of
the normal distribution of density. Where however only little rain
has fallen while the cloud stratum is extensive and dense, the total dis-
turbance due to the general warmth of air and cloud over the whole
region may be equally great, but not especially-intense at any one point.

(VII) Prediction of the weather.—The preceding considerations, which
are those that guided me in my earliest predictions in Cincinnati and
Washington, will enable any one to enter upon any series of charts of
existing conditions a system of numbers showing the places over which
the atmospheric disturbance in the cloud region is—or is likely to be—
appreciable, and to judge of its relative intensity as depending on the
excess or deficiency in the density of the air. From this we can reason
as to the first tendency of the movements of the air or the initial wind.
The consideration of the orography of the surrounding country will then
give us the basis for a conclusion as to whether in any region the gen-
eral movement of the atmosphere will tend to cool or warm any mass of
air (especially by carrying it over rising or resisting ground and forcing
it up to the higher levels or by pushing cold air under warm air), and
thereby initiate a still further condensation and exaggerate the disturb-
ances already existing, or possibly producing local rain and wholly new
centers of disturbance. By thus considering as fully as possible the
effects of solar heat, atmospheric moisture, orography, ete., we are able
to enter upon the weather map a series of figures showing our estimate
of all the disturbances likely to oceur during the immediate future. In
general, we find that convective disturbances of equilibrium increase
from the morning map to the afternoon map, and diminish from the 11
P.M. to the 7 A.M. map; during the interval from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M.
the larger disturbances, such as thunder storms, tornadoes, and hurri-
canes, generally attain a maximum and begin“to diminish. The phe-
nomena specially due to terrestrial radiation have their maximum effect
between the 11 P.M. and 7 A. M. reports; between these hours we find,
for instance, that many extensive storms begin over regions for which at
11 P.M. the reports show clear weather. As the prevailing and probable
future direction and force of the wind are so important, it becomes very
necessary, in dealing with a limited part of the earth’s surface, to ex-
amine the reports from outlying border stations in order to ascertain
the possible existence at a distance of unseen centers of disturbance; a
slight abnormal fall in the barometer, or rise of temperature, or shift of
winds, or increase in cloud and rain may be the indicator of a distant
storm; equally frequent is it that a general rise of pressure or increase
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 417

of cold northerly winds indicates the existence of an unseen low ba-
rometer and severe storm to the southwest or southeast, toward which
these winds are blowing. Perhaps the most useful rule in this respect
is founded on the motions of clouds. The following generalization
(announced by me in February 1872 as resulting from the study of up-
per and lower clouds and winds displayed on every Signal Service map
and quite independent of simultaneous European studies), will, it is be-
lieved, be found +o hold good for the whole northern hemisphere: ‘¢ The
general direction towards which any stratum of air is moving nearly hori-
zontally, is somewhat to the right hand of the direction of motion of the
stratum just above it, that is to say, the direction of the lower clouds
is to the right of that of the wind at the earth’s surface; the higher
clouds move to tne right of the lower clouds and the cirrus again to the
right of the latter; these directions of motion may be so related that
the cirrus shall e moving in a direction nearly opposite to that of the
surface winds or the lower clouds. In general, when the lower currents
are flowing in toward a storm center the upper currents are flowing out
from it; or aga:n, when the lower currents are flowing out from an
area of high pressure and clear, dry weather the upper currents are
flowing in towardsit.” It follows that when an outlying station reports
the motions of the cirrus cloud, we are able to infer something as to the ex-
istence of the arva ef the low barometer from which the cirri are coming.

(1) Prediction vf general storms.—When we have thus approximately
estimated the prebable location and amount of the disturbances in den-
sity over all portions of the United States and outlying regions, we are
then to decide whether a storm already initiated will increase or di-
minish in intensity, and in what direction its center will move.

It may be accepted as a fundamental principle that a given disturb-
ance will spreaé in the direction of those regions where processes
are going on that favor similar disturbances. Thus, if a mass of heavy
air, like the nortiers of the Mississippi Valley, is flowing in any diree-
tion under a mass of abnormally light air, it will tend to move always
in the direction where the lightest air is to be found, or where the di-
urnal changes of heat and evaporation favor the development of ab-
normally light ar. Or again, if a storm is already in existence and
is maintained by the condensation of moisture in the cloud region, it
will be continuously moving toward the region where the condensation
is going on most actively. The regions where storms are being initi-
ated or most liberally supported are generally detected (1) by observed
abnormal temperature and moisture ; (2) by the formation of haze, halos,
cloud, and rain or snow; and (3) by a slight fall in the barometer due
to movements ir the atmosphere at the level of the cloud stratum.
The future movements of storm centers can generally be detected by
the observed changes going on in the direction of movement of the wind
or clouds. All of these meteorological elements must be examined by
careful comparisons of the preceding tri-daily maps in order to ascer-

H. Mis. 142-27
418 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

tain whether a given storm will increase or diminish, and especially
whether it will follow some one of the average storm tracks, or whether
it will make special deviation from them. The general paths pursued
by storm centers and their average velocities can be used only for
general climatic indications, and not for special storm predictions.
Detailed maps of the direction and velocity of the movements of storm
centers in the United States have been prepared; a general view of the
so-called storm frequency, or, more properly, the frequency with which
barometric minima (Sometimes without violent winds) pass over each
section of the country, is given by achart designed and prepared by me
in 1874, and published in Walker’s Statistical Atlas of the United States.
With these barometric minima generally come clouds, rain and snow, high
winds, suddenly shifting from south and east to west and north, warm,
moist, followed by colder, dry weather, and all the characteristics of
very variable severe climates. .A more complete chart, showing the
total number of times that such barometric minima have during the ten
years October, 1872, to September, 1882, passed over each degree square
of the territory east of the meridian of 102° west longitude, has been
prepared, and gives a basis for many climatic generalities.

The prediction of a special storm path, orits deviation from a normal
path (if such a term is allowable) must be based upon a detailed study
of ali the above-mentioned disturbing or controlling influences. Some
of the average effects of these influences are shown in the following par-
agraphs:

(a) Maydell, from the study of the storms of Northern Europe, showed
in 1873 that the storm path for the coming twenty-four hours forms a
determinate angle with the line connecting the present place of the bar-
ometric minimum with that of the greatest rise of temperature in the
past twenty-four hours. This angle is always formed on the left hand
of that connecting line, supposing the face to be turned towards the
point of rising temperature and the back towards the point of minimum
barometer. This angle varies between zero and 90 degrees, as the ex-
treme cases, while it is on the average in winter about 60 degrees; the
summer storm tracks are classified in two groups, for which this angle
is respectively 40 and 70 degrees. The angle depends toa certain ex-
tent upon the position of the center of highest temperature, being
smaller according as the point lies more to the east of the barometric
minimum. (See Maydell’s appendix to the Bulletin for December, 1873,
of the Physical Observatory at St. Petersburg.)

Maydeli’s rules accord with my own experience ; the elevation of tem-
perature before a storm had been long known botb for England and for
the United States, but the amount of angular deviation of the storm-
center to the left of the rising temperature is, I think, very little in
the eastern part of the United States.

(b) The region over which the greatest rain-fall will take place is
that towards which the storm center will have a strong tendency to
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 419

move; the location where it is now raining, as shown by the map, is
usually near the present location of the center of disturbance and in ad-
vance of the center of low pressure due to the movement of wind.
Loomis finds that in the United States the rain area extends farther in
front than in the rear of the storm ; its mean extent is 500 miles in front,
and for every increase in this distance the velocity of the storm move-
ment is increased. He also finds that within the United States much
more rain falls in front of the area of low pressure than in its rear; a
great rain-fall in the rear retards the motion.

(c) The barometric changes, being the direct result of horizontal
winds and only the indirect result of the changes in temperature, mois-
ture, vertical movements and condensations sum up as it were the re-
sult of all preceding disturbances. Loomis finds that the velocity of
progress of a storm is independent of the amount of the central depres-
sion of the barometer. The average velocity of movement of centers
of low pressure in the United States is about 26 miles per hour; the
pressure rises faster in the rear of fast-moving storms; thus, if the
pressure in the rear rises 20 per cent. faster than the mean, the storm
moves 7 miles per hour faster ; if it rises 20 per cent. slower, the storm
moves 7 miles per hour slower. Thisis evidently a direct result of the
fact that the center of indraft up toward the clouds is propagated (not
moved bodily) forward faster than the lower winds can follow.

(ad) J. Elliot gives the following as the favorable conditions for the
formation and growth of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, and these may,
with slight modifications, be applied to the Gulf of Mexico and the West
Indies:

1. The invariable antecedents of cyclones are approximate uniformity
of pressure over and around the coast of the Bay of Bengal, light vari-
able winds or calms over a considerable portion of the bay, and little or
no rain-fall over the coast region, as well as in the bay; the weather is
therefore sultry and the sea smoother. The amount of aqueous vapor
accumulates and finally gives rise to peculiar sky effects. The immedi-
ate antecedent is heavy rain-fall concentrated over a portion of the bay
accompanied by a strong indraft, most marked from the Indian Ocean
at the entrance of the bay. This indraft fiom the Indian Ocean gives
rise to strong winds and heavy rains at the stations on the south and
west coasts of Ceylon.

2. The source of the energy is the condensation of vapor and precipi-
tation of rain ; or the primary cause of cyclone formation is the produc-
tion and ascent of a large quantity of vapor, which is condensed with the
liberation of its latent heat over the place of production, instead of be-
ing carried away to some distant region. (See J. Eliot’s report on the
Madras cyclone of May, 1877, and similar conclusions in his account of
the southwest monsoon storm of 1883.)

(2) Prediction of local storms.—The tornado is an exaggeration of the
mild thunder storm, especially in that the revolving cloud that is some-

times seen high up at the base of the thunder storm now reaches down
to the earth, and the violent winds due to its up-draft cause great de-
struction. These storms occur usually in the broad currents of warm,
moist southerly winds that prevail on the south and east sides of an area
of low pressure or general storm center ; they arein fact whirls within
whirls, and may be expected as likely to occur when on the morning
weather map the depression of the dew-point is reported as only a few
degrees, and southerly winds cover the country, blowing toward a storm
center in the northwest, or lake region.

(The preceding paragraph as written in 1883 expresses a generaliza-
tion familiar to me since boyhood and in agreement with views of Espy
and many writers; the conviction of its general truth had led me in
1871 and 1872 to frequently publish in the official daily weather predic-
tions the paragraph, “ Conditions are favorable for severe local storms.”
Any discussion as to the original author of this generalization would
carry us back to the first weather charts of Leverrier 1858, Henry 1850,
Espy 1838, Loomis 1838, and Kaemtz 1835, and Brandes 1828.)

The number of tornadoes likely to occur in any State in any one year
is shown approximately by the figures in the sixth column of the foi-
lowing table, as copied from Finley’s ‘‘ Character of Six Hundred Torna-
does,” first edition, 1882 (the second edition April 1884, would not ma-
terially change these figures); but the relative geographical distribu-
tion is only fairly shown by adopting some such unit of area as 100 miles
square or 10,000 square miles, for which unit we find the annual average
frequency given in the seventh column. The last column of this table
should replace the misleading statement of the number of tornadoes on
record in any State, without considering the area of the State or the
number of years and observers involved in getting together the lists.

When we consider the narrowness and shortness of the destructive
portion of the paths of most *‘ tornadoes,” we see that even in Kansas
and Iowa the probability that any given spot will be visited by one is
at the rate of less than 1 per cent. per century, or less than the chance
of death by lightning or railroad accident, or other casualty.

These storms move along nearly with the prevailing general current
of air at the cloud level, but deflecting somewhat as influenced by the
422 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

supply of moist air and by local topography ; they die out when friction
or dry air cuts off the moisture or when the supply wind blows down
grade. They apparently owe their characteristics to an upward draft
of air toward the dark masses of cloud that are overhead, and within
which the processes of condensation of moisture, evolution of latent
heat, and uprising of lighter air are going on with intensity. The de-
tails of the mechanism of these storms are fully given by Ferrel in his
‘‘ Meteorological Researches, part 0,” Washington, 1880 (and in his
“Recent Advances,” Washington, 1886).

The relative frequency of occurrence of tornadoes in the United States
for each month is shown by the following table, as given by Finley, who
has however possibly included a few storms that should more properly
have been classed as destructive thunder storms:

(3) Special local predictions.—Beside the predictions of storms the
next most important item is the prediction of the separate elements of
the weather that affect local human industries; especially hoar-frost,
heat, wind, and rain.

(a) Frost.—Severe frosts occur only when the atmosphere is clear ;
they are in great part the effect of radiation of heat from the surfaces
of plants and the earth. Their prediction depends principally upon
the questions, how many degrees will the temperature of the surface of
leaves of plants fall by radiation; if it falls to 32° or less, then will the
atmospheric moisture condense into fog or cloud before or after the
radiating surface of the plants cools down to that freezing temperature ?
If on the evening map there are entered, first, a series of relative num-
bers showing the prospective clearness of the sky; second, a series show-
ing the time that will elapse before sunrise; then a series showing the
probable diurnal range of temperature, an estimate can be made of the fall
in temperature for each section of the country before the next sunrise.
If now these latter figures are compared with the map showing the
depression of the dew-point at 11 P. M., those regions will be perceived
over which fog and clouds are likely to be formed; the remaining or
clear regions are the only ones in which dew is to be feared, and of
these only those are in imminent danger of frost at which the dew-
point is below 32°,

The probable diurnal range of temperature is best found by study-
ing the actual fall between 11 P. M. and 7 A. M., as reported during the
preceding few clear days from the stations in the neighborhood in
question. The preceding rule takes no account of the wind, which if
DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY. 423

fresh or brisk, will generally prevent or nullify the severity of the frost.
Areas of cold dry air frequently flow southward and spread as northers
over large regions of the country, confining themselves especially to the
low lands and river valleys. Within these areas of clear, cold, dry air,
and especially on their advancing fronts, the process of freezing is often
accelerated by the combination of convection with radiation, and in
such cases the destruction to vegetation is particularly severe; there-
fore, in the prediction of frosts, attention must be especially directed
tosuch areas. The rate at which these advance is of course greater when
the cold air flows down a gentle incline, such as that of the Mississippi
Valley. When such cold areas reach the Gulf of Mexico the lowest
stratum of air moves more rapidly, and after overrunning a large por-
tion of the Gulf, banks up the atmosphere on the Mexican shore, and
causes extensive rains, which sometimes initiate cyclones, and return
as such to the northward. This phenomenon was clearly perceived and
verbally explained to my fellow-laborers in 187172 in the Signal office ;
the parallelism between the Norther, the Bore, the Pampero, and sim-
ilar winds was also then dwelt on; the flow of cold air and the forma-
tion of gulf storms were even then clearly predicted.

(b) Rain.—For convenience in establishing general rules for the pre-
diction of rains, they may be divided into four classes, as follows:

(1) Merely local rains depending almost wholly upon the rapid ascent
of small masses of over-heated moist air; these occur almost entirely
between 9 A. M. and 6 P.M., and are oftentimes simultaneous in isolated
localities over a great extent of the country. They are liable to occur
whenever the 7 A. M. map shows a high dew-point and clear or nearly
clear weather, and when the winds are or are about to be such as will
carry the sui face air up a gentle slope; they occur with southerly winds
in the Gulf States or southeast winds on the Atlantic coast; they occur
on the latter coast rarely with winds between west and northwest,
since such winds are carrying the air downwards toward the sea and
warming it by compression.

(2) Local rains, on a larger scale, generally accompanied by light-
ning, and known as thunder storms, occurring in the afternoon between
3 and 10 o’clock, and due to the uplifting of large masses of moist air
from the low lands by the underflow of denser (i. e. cooler or drier) air.
This convective process begins most easily in mountainous regions,
where the afternoon radiation, during the declining sun, proceeds more
rapidly than in the low lands; in fact the downflow of cold dry air from
the mountains is a periodical phenomena tending to take place regularly
at all times of the year. The decision of the question as to whether rain
will follow or not depends upon the balance between the mass of cooled
air over the mountains and the adjacent moist air. The question can
generally be decided by considering the time of day at which the for-
mation of heavy cumuli begins. It, e. g., at Washington this occurs
later than 5 P. M. rain is not likely, if before 3 Pp. M. rain is probable.
424 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 18838.

Such storms generally show themselves as well under way on the 3 P. M.
map. The geographical distribution of frequency of this class of
storms for the United States was illustrated by me in the map for Au-
gust, 1874, published in the Signal Service Monthly Weather Review
for that month.

The paths pursued by these thunder storms trend eastward or north-
eastward, as in Europe, see Mohn and Hildebrandsson. They may
be classed as (1) those that attend a very low pressures, and (2) those
that starton the advancing edge of areas of cool, dry air. or high barom-
eter, and (3) those that occur within and on the rearward side of high
areas. Quite a number of them may exist simultaneousiy, for instance,
along the whole eastern slope of the Appalachian range, all moving in
nearly parallel lines northeastward until they die out in the early morn-
ing hours, generally before they reach the Atlantic shore. but sometimes
extending a little ways out to sea.

(3) Light general rains occurring between 1 and 8 A. M.,and which are
apparently caused by radiation of heat from a layer of moist air some
distance above the earth. Frequently when the sky is perfectly clear
at 11 P. M. there prevails over a special region a general strong southerly
current feeding a storm center to the northward, but not as yet followed
by any condensation in this special region. It would seem that the
nocturnal radiation of heat from the moist and hazy sky now comes in
powerfully to supplement the dynamic cooling, which latter process de-
pends on ascension, and therefore, of course, is less active during the
night than during sunshine; accordingly haze and cloud form after 11
Pp. M. and light general rains or snow fall in the early morning hours,
and are reported on the 7 A. M. map; these are liable to be stopped by
the sun’s heat as soon as that is sufficient to counteract the radiation,
but when this heat first falls on the cloud top it stimulates the convec-
tion and the precepitation. The only means of anticipating the oceur-
rence of this class of rains consists in a close observance of all the ante-
cedent phenomena in order to estimate the probable relative tempera-
ture and moisture of the air overhead; the only observations bearing
on this subject, as shown by the 11 Pp. M. map, are a slight tendency to
haze, the formation and disappearance of loose clouds, a slight cheek in
the temperature, and especially the reports of halos around the moon,
to which, according to Montigny, it is important to add the observation
of the scintillation of the stars.

(4) Extended heavy rains. These generally attend either areas of
low pressure, where great masses of air apparently have slow ascend-
ing and vorticose movements, or prevailing winds tiat carry great
masses of moist air up mountain or plateau slopes te higher levels;
these rains are therefore due principally to dynamic cooling, and are
well illustrated by easterly storms of the Atlantic coast, the northerly
storms of the Central American and Mexican coasts, and the southerly
winds of the Gulf States, Their prediction is imphed ia the prediction
of a general storm as before treated of.
CHEMISTRY FOR 1887 AND 1888.

By F. W. CLARKE.

GENERAL AND THEORETICAL.

Atomic weights ; oxygen.—The composition of water and the relation
between the atomic weights of hydrogen and oxygen have been discussed
during the year by Cooke and Richards, Scott, Keiser, Morley, and
Lord Rayleigh.

Cooke and Richards adopted the following plan: Hydrogen, purified
with extraordinary care, was weighed in large glass globes which had
previously been exhausted by means of aSprengel pump. It was then
burned by passing it over heated copper oxide, and the water so formed
was weighed. Three series of experiments, numbering sixteen in all,
were made, and distinguished from each other by the use of hydrogen
derived from different sources. First, hydrogen was used which had
been evolved from zine and sulphuric acid; secondly, hydrogen was
obtained by electrolysis; and in the third series the gas was derived
from the action of potassium hydroxide upon aluminium foil. In this
way the errors due to possible impurity in hydrogen from only one source
were sought to beavoided. The mean results by series were as follows,
when H=1:

Series I, five experiments...---..----------- O=15.954; -+ .0048
_ Series II, five experiments.-.-..-.--.--------- 15.953; + .0022
Series III, six experiments.-.-.------+---+-- 15.952; + .0035
Average of the sixteen experiments..---. ---- 15.953 ; + .0017

The quantity of hydrogen burned in each experiment was a little over
0.4gramme. The only possible impurity in it was nitrogen, which was
looked for spectroscopically, but not found. Its absence however could
not be certainly proved, and its effect, if present, would be to render the
apparent atomic weight of oxygen too low; in other words, ifs presence
would lead to possibly erroneous conclusions relative to “ Prout’s law.”
(Proc. Amer. Acad., XXIII, 149.)

The investigations of Alexander Scott relate to the composition of
water by volume. It is well known that oxygen and hydrogen, as act-
ually measured at ordinary temperatures and pressures, do not rigidly
conform to Boyle’s law. They vary from it in opposite directions ; and
this fact must be taken into account before we can deduce their relative

425
426 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

atomic weights from their relative densities. Scott,in his experiments,
has paid especial attention to the following points:

(1) The preparation of purer gases.

(2) The use of larger voiumes.

(3) The measurement of both gases in the same vessel.

(4) The analysis of the residue left after explosion of the mixed
gases, and determination of the impurity in each experiment.

Twenty-one experiments were made, giving as the most probable ratio
1.994 volumes of H to one volume of O. Hence, if the density of O in
terms of H is 15.9627, its atomic weight becomes 16.01. (Proc. Roy.
Soc., XLII, 396. Chem. News, LVI, 173.)

Morley’s paper (Am. Chem. Journ., xX, 21) is essentially a discussion
of Scott’s work, with an outline of proposed methods for the settlement
of the problems under consideration.

Lord Rayleigh (Chem. News, Lvu, 73) has re-determined the density
ratio between H and O, and finds it to be 1: 15.884. The application of
this ratio to atomic-weight discussions depends upon investigations like
those of Scott. Rayleigh also calls attention to a source of error in the
process of weighing gases, which arises from the fact that a glass globe
when exhausted of air, is sensibly condensed by atmospheric pressure ;
that is, its capacity when empty is perceptibly less than when full.
This error affects Regnault’s density determinations. Cooke and Rich-
ards (Am. Chem. Journ. x, 191) recognize the importance of Rayleigh’s
observations, and apply them to the correction of their own results.
They determine the magnitude of the error produced in their own glass
globes, and find that it reduces their value for the atomic weight of
oxygen from 15.953 to 15.869. This is the lowest value yet assigned to
that constant.

Keiser attempts to ascertain the composition of water directly by
weighing hydrogen occluded in palladium, expelling it by heat, burn-
ing it over copper oxide, and weighing the water so formed. Three pre-
liminary experiments (Berichte, xx, 2323) gave in sum a value for oxygen
of 15.8722. In a later paper he gives in detail his process, together
with his final results. Ten combustions were made, with 6.5588 grammes
of hydrogen in all, giving values for O ranging from 15.943 to 15.958, or,
in sum, 15.9482. He shows that the hydrogen weighed was presumably
pure, and that no nitrogen was occluded with it. His final figure agrees
quite nearly with the earlier determination of Cooke and Richards.
(Am. Chem. Journ., x, 249.)

Fluorine.—The atomic weight of this element, which has hitherto been
determined by the conversion of fluorides into sulphates, Christenson
has verified by a new method. When the double fluoride of ammonium
and manganese, Am.MnF., is added to a mixture of potassium iodide
and hydrochloric acid, it liberates iodine, which may be titrated with
sodium thiosulphate. One molecule of the salt, as above formulated,
sets free one atom of iodine. our determinations were made, giving
CHEMISTRY. 427

in mean, if H=1, N=14.01, I=126.54, and Mn=55.0; F=18.94. (Journ.
Prakt. Chem. (2), xxxv, 551.)

Zinc.—Morse and Burton redetermine the atomie weight of zine by
the oxidation of the metal. Pure distilled zine was treated with nitric
acid, and the residue from the evaporated solution after gentle heating
was strongly ignitedin a muffle. Fifteen experiments gave figures rang-
ing from Zn=65.091 to Zn=65.119, or in mean, Zn=65.106when O= 15.96.
The same method with slight differences of detail had previously been
used by Erdmann, and was recently criticised by Marignac, who
claimed that oxide of zine was dissociated at high temperatures, and
also that it retained oxides of nitrogen. Morse and Burton show these
objections to be groundless. (Am. Chem. Journ., x, 311.)

Reynolds and Ramsay estimate, with many elaborate precautions,
the amount of hydrogen evolved upon the solution of pure zine in an
acid. Twenty-nine experiments were made, of which twenty-four were
rejected. The remaining five when fully corrected give concordant
values, making the atomie weight of zine in mean, Zn=65.4787, + .06135.
The weight of the hydrogen measured was computed by means of Reg-
nault’s data. (Journ. Chem. Soc., December, 1887.)

Zine, iron, and aluminum.—The equivalents of these metals as roughly
redetermined by students in his laboratory have been published by J.
Torrey, jr. In each case the metal was dissolved in an acid, and the
hydrogen set free was measured. The mean results are as follows,
when H=1.

The values obtained in the individual determinations are not sharply
concordant, and the work is chiefly interesting from the stand-point of
the teacher. It illustrates the possibility of training students in the
verification of important constants. (Am. Chem. Journ., X, 73.)

Copper.—Richards has published two papers on the atomic weight of
this element. When metallic copper is placed in a solution of silver
nitrate, metallic silver is precipitated, and when the solution is ice-cold
the reaction is sharply quantitative. In the first paper six experiments
are given, in which the silver was dried at 150° C. From then, if
Ag=107.675, we can deduce the value Cu=63.437. In the second paper
Richards states that the silver of his earlier series of weighing still re-
tained traces of moisture. Five additional determinations were there-
fore made, in which the silver before weighing was heated to incipient
redness. These gave in mean, Cu=63.450; +.0006. (Proc. Amer.
Acad., Xx11, 346, and Xx1I1, 177.)

Silicon —Thorpe and Young re-determine the atomic weight of silicon
by means of the bromide. That compound was decomposed by water,
and after evaporation to dryness the residual silica was weighed.
Nine experiments were made, giving from Si = 28.243 to Si = 28.429; in
428 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

mean, Si = 28.332. Meyer and Seubert’s values for O and Br. were used
in calculating. (Journ. Chem. Soc., June, 1887.)

Thorium.—From eight analyses of the sulphate, Kriiss and Nilson
find in mean Th = 231.869, when O=15.96 and S=31.98. (Berichte,
Xx, 1665.)

Osmium.—The atomic weight of osmium has had peculiar interest
from the fact that the value ordinarily assigned to it was out of har-
mony with the periodic law. The constant has been re-determined by
Seubert, who analyzed after usual methods the osmichlorides of am-
monium and potassium. His results may be computed in the form of
eight ratios, which give values for Os varying from 189.72 to 192.00. The
mean of all is OS=191.12; which Seubert regards as still slightly too
high. Meyer and Seubert’s figures for Ag, K, N, and Cl were used in
the calculations, with H=1. (Berichte, xxt, 1839.)

Platinum.—Dittmar and McArthur, from experiments of a complex
kind upon the chloroplatinates of potassium, ammonium, and rubid-
ium, conclude that Seubert’s determination, Pt=194.8, is too low,
and that 195.5 is more nearly the correct value. (Trans. Roy. Soe.
Edinburgh, Xxx1u, 561.)

Seubert replies to the foregoing paper, and maintains his own figures.
He also calls attention to the fact that his results had been fully con-
firmed by Halberstadt. (Berichte, xx1, 2519.)

Ruthenium.—Redetermined by Joly, who gives Ru= 101.5, without
particulars. (Compt. Rend., CvIt, 997.)

Gold.—Kriiss determines the atomic¢ weight of gold by means of five
ratios, representing the neutral chloride, Au Ci;, and the salt K Au Bry.
The chloride was reduced by sulphurous acid, the gold was weighed as
metal, and the chloride as silver chloride. Eight such experiments gave
jn mean Au = 196.622. The double bromide gave the following ratios:

The final value, representing thirty experiments, was Au = 196.697,

(Berichte, xx, 205.)

The same constant was also measured by Thorpe and Laurie, who
likewise made use of the double salt K Au Br; Three ratios were
taken: First, the salt was decomposed by heat, and the residual Au, and
K Br, were both weighed. Secondly, the K Br from the former series
was titrated with silver solution, giving the ratio Au: Ag. Thirdly,
the Ag Br found in the last reaction was also weighed, giving the ratio
Au: Ag Br. Taking H = 1 and Stas’ figures for Ag, K, and Br, we have:

From Aq: Ke Br; eight experiments: 22 2---------—- Au = 196.876.

Over these two sets of determinations, which differ in mean by nearly
0.2, some controversy has arisen. For details, see Thorpe and Laurie
(Berichte, xx, 3036, and Journ. Chem. Soc., December, 1887), and Kriiss,
(Berichte, Xx, 2365, and xxt, 128). Meanwhile Mallet has published a
preliminary note, without particulars, concerning a determination which
he has made. He gets a direct ratio between gold and hydrogen, giv-
ing for gold a value somewhat higher than that obtained by Thorpe and
Laurie. (Chem. News, No. 1452.)

The determination of molecular weights.—Harly in 1888 Victor Meyer
called attention to Raoult’s method for ascertaining molecular weights,
pronouncing it to be the most important advance in that field of work
Since the aunouncement of Dulong and Petit’s law. The method, in
principle, is as follows: When any substance is dissolved, the freezing
point of the solvent is lowered ; and that depression of freezing point is
directly related to the molecular weight of the body in solution. If we
divide the observed depression of freezing point for each substance ex-
amined by the weight of the substance dissolved in 100 grammes of
water, we get a coefficient of depression which gives, when multiplied
by the molecular weight, a constant quantity. The latter constant is
independent of concentration, and has approximately uniform value for
all similarly constituted bodies in any given solvent. It is called the
molecular depression ; and differs for different solvents; but in glacial
acetic acid it seems to have one value for all substances. Water, acetic
acid, and benzene seem to be the only solvents of general applicability.
If now it is desired to know the molecular weight of a soluble body to
which vapor-density methods are inapplicable, we have only to deter-
mine its coefficient of depression and compute from that the sought for
value. The method, as a physical process, is not sharply accurate; but
it is close enough to decide between the lowest empirical formula assign-
able to a substance and the various multiples thereof. Although the
original investigation was published by Raoult in 1883, it attracted
‘little attention until Meyer’s paper appeared; but since then it has
been widely noted, and the method extensively applied. (See Meyer,
Berichte, xx1, 536, and Auwers, ibid., Xx1, 701.) Auwers also describes
a convenient form of apparatus, and so too does Beckmann. (Zeit.
Phys. Chem., 11, 638.)

In illustration of the use of Raoult’s method, the following researches
out of many may be cited:

Ramsay, working with an acetic acid solution, finds the molecular
weight of liquid nitric peroxide to be 92, at a temperature of about
16°. Hence its formula is N,O,, and it seems, furthermore, to undergo
no dissociation upon dilution. (Journ. Chem. Soe., Lit, 621.)

Brown and Morris, using aqueous solutions, get depression values for
dextrose, cane sugar, maltose, lactose, and arabinose corresponding to
their accepted molecular weights. For raftinose the simplest empiri-
cal formula, C),;H 0,5. 5H20, corresponds to the results obtained by
Raoult’s method. (Journ. Chem. Soc., Li, 610.)
430 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Paterno and Nasini with aqueous solutions find that citraconic, mes-
aconic, and itaconic acids have the same coefficients of depression, and
are therefore strictly isomeric. A like statement holds of malic and
fumaric acids. (Berichte, XX1, 2156.)

Louise and Roux, in order to determine the constitution of aluminum
compounds, investigated aluminum ethyl, propyl, and isoamyl by
Raoult’s method, with ethylene bromide as the solvent. The results
agree with the formule Al,X¢,, in which X stands for the alcohoi-radicle.
Compare the diverse results obtainedby other chemists with the vapor-
_ density method. (Compt. Rend., cv1,.600.)

The depression proluced in the freezing point of benzene by various
phenolic substances was studied by Paterno. Phenol behaves abnor-
mally, but ethylphenol, acetylphenol, two nitrophenols, tribromphenol,
picric acid, paracresol, methyl salicylate, thymol, nitro-thymol, nitro-
sothymol, naphthol, and benzylphenol all gave normal results, both in
benzene and in acetic acid. (Berichte, Xxt, 3178.)

Density of gases and vapors.—In discussing the atomic weight of oxy-
gen attention was called to Lord Rayleigh’s observation that the volume
of a glass globe when full differs from the volume of the same globe
when empty. This observation affects all of Regnault’s determinations
of the weight of gases,and the results of the latter have been cor-
rected by Crafts, who had access to Regnault’s original apparatus, ex-
cepting the glass globe actually used, which had been destroyed. An-
other globe of the same lot, however, was available, and presumably
identical for all practical purposes with it. The following are the spe-
cific gravities as given by Regnault and as corrected by Crafts, air being
taken as unity.

The actual correction was 3 milligrammes added to the weight of
each gas as given by Regnault at 760 millimeters pressure. (Compt.
Rend., CVI, 1662.)

J. Mensching and Victor Meyer find that at high temperatures the
vapors of phosphorus and arsenie are not in agreement with the sup-
posed molecules P, and As,, but that at a white heat they approximate
to P, and As, For antimony the molecule Sb, does not exist, the
probable molecule being either Sb, or Sb). (Berichte, xx, 1833.)

Biltz, redetermining the vapor density of sulphur, under various con-
ditions, obtains values ranging from 7.937 down to 4.734, He concludes,
hence, that the commonly accepted view that free sulphur in vapor is
S, is not correct, and that the true formulaisS,. (Berichte, xxt, 2013.)

With reference to the chlorides of iron, chromium, indium, gallium,
and aluminum, various determinations have been made, with varying
results. First, as to aluminum, whose chloride has hitherto been writ-

ten, on the strength of Deville and Troost’s researches, Al, Clg, which
corresponds to a density of 9.20. According to Nilson and Petterson
the density at 440° is 7.789, at 758° it is 4.802, and above that temper-
ature, from 1117° to 12609, it is fairly constant at from 4.247 to 4.277.
The value 4.600 corresponds to the molecule AIC],, which is required
by the trivalency of aluminum, as indicated by the periodic law.
(Zeitsch. Physikal. Chem., 1, 459.)

On the other hand, Friedel and Crafts, at temperatures ranging from
218° to 433°, find a vapor density of 9.24, agreeing with Deville and
Troost’s determination. They get no evidence of dissociation into any
simpler molecules. (Compt. Rend., cv1, 1764.)

Conformable with these data Louise and Roux, working with alu-
minum methyl and aluminum ethyl, get values corresponding to the
general molecules Al, R;. For the same compounds Buckton and Od-
ling long ago found densities according with Al R;. Both compounds,
according to Louise and Roux, decompose at high temperatures, yield-
ing aluminum, hydrogen, and hydrocarbons. (Compare also the data
obtained by the same authors by Raoult’s method, as cited in the pre-
ceding article. (Compt. Rend., Cv1, 73 and 602.)

Altogether the evidence seems to prove the existence of Al,R, mole-
cules, which split up at high temperatures into two of Al R;.

Ferrie chloride, if Fe,Cl,, requires a vapor density of 11.2. If FeCl,
its value should be 5.6. Griinewald and V. Meyer obtain the following
values: At 448°, 10.487; at 518°, 9.569 ; at 606°, 8.383; at about 750°,
5.389 to 5.528, with evidence of dissociation; at about 10509, 4.915 to
5.307, and similar figures at higher temperatures. At 448° it vaporizes
completely undeco mposed, and even then its vapor density is too low for
Fe,Cl, That compound, therefore, they believe does not exist; and
regard the lower symbol, FeCl;, to be the true one. At the higher tem-
peratures it splits up to some extent into FeCl, and free chlorine. (Be-
richte, XXI, 687.)

To this investigation, as to Nilson and Petterson’s on aluminum chlo-
ride, Friedel and Crafts reply. They determine the vapor density of
ferric chloride in presence of free chlorine, in order to prevent any de-
composition, and find a figure agreeing with Fe,Cl,. Their data are
for temperatures from 321° to 342°. (Compt. Rend., cvit, 302. Com-
pare Biltz, Berichte, xx1, 2766.)

Ferrous chloride, redetermined by Nilson and Petterson, at tem-
peratures varying from 1300° to 1500°, has a density of 4.292 to 3.340.
Theory for FeC),, 4.375. Karlier work by V. Meyer seems to indicate a
more complex molecule at lower temperatures. (Journ. Chem. Soc.,
Lit, 827.)

Nilson and Petterson also have determined the vapor density of
chromic and chromous chlorides. For the former, at 1200° to 13009, it
agrees closely with the molecule CrC},. At 1065° a higher value was
found, but not at allapproximating to Cr,Cls. The latter probably can
432 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

not exist in the gaseous state. For chromous chloride the data give a
density considerably too high for CrCl; but the compound vaporizes
with difficulty, and the density diminishes with rise of temperature.
CrCl, is probably the true formula. (Journ. Chem. Soe., Lit, 828.)

Gallium.—According to Nilson and Petterson the trichloride of this
metal has a vapor density which at 350° is 8.846, at 606° is 6.144, and
at 1,000-1,100° is 5.185. Ga,Cl, requires 12.16. GaCl, requires 6.08.
The latter value is probably correct. They also describe a dichloride
whose vapor density agrees with the symbol GaCl. (Journ. Chem.
Soe., LIiI, 822.)

In this case also Nilson and Petterson are partly controverted by
Friedei and Crafts, who find the tri-chloride of gallium, as measured at
273°, to be Ga,Cls. Above this temperature it begins to dissociate, per-
haps into 2 GaCl;.. (Compt. Rend., cvu, 306.)

For indium, Nilson and Petterson re-examined the trichloride, and
also describe two new compounds, a mono- and dichloride, respectively.
The vapor densities of the three compounds indicate molecules of InCl,,
InC}l,, and InCl. (Journ. Chem. Soc., Li, 816.) The density of the
trichloride is also given by Biltz, who finds it concordant with InCl,.
(Berichte, xx1, 2766.) Ali of the foregoing data relative to the iron-
aluminum group are well summarized by Sydney Young, who gives
them in tabular form in Nature for December 27, 1888. His note is
discussed by Brauner in the same journal for January 31, 1889.

The vapor density of tellurium tetrachloride has been studied by
Michaelis. It boils at 380°, and up to 448° it distills undecomposed.
Even at 530 it is scarcely dissociated at all, and its density indicates a
molecule of TeCl,, Hence tellurium is at least quadrivalent. (Berichte,
OX L780.)

Refrigerating mixtures.—The freezing mixtures containing solidified

varbon dioxide have been carefully studied by Cailletet and Colardeau,
who give the following determinations of temperature :

ture as compared with that of the original solid. (Compt. Rend., CVI,

CHEMISTRY. 433

Hydrates of gases.—Villard finds that when certain gases mixed with
aqueous vapor are condensed in Cailletet’s apparatus, crystalline hy-
drates are produced, which decompose spontaneously at the following
temperatures: Of CHy, at 21.95; of C,H. at 12°; of C,H, at 18.95;
of C,H, at 14°; of N.O, at 12°. Nitrogen, hydrogen, carbonic oxide,
nitric oxide, cyanogen, ammonia, propylene, butylene, and allylene gave
no erystals under similar conditions. (Compt. Rend., cy1, 1602.)

The formation of alloys.—The claim made by Spring that Wood’s alloy
could be formed from its component metals by means of pressure has
led Hallock to investigate the subject from another point of view. One
part cadmium, one part tin, two parts lead, and four parts bismuth, in
fine filings, were mixed in a glass tube of about five millimeters interior
diameter, clused at one end. The mixture was packed in the tube by
gentle pressure with an iron wire, and the whole was then suspended
in a water bath and exposed to a temperature of 98° to 100°. Within
two days the entire mass was fluid, the alloy having formed at a tem-
perature 130° below the melting point of its most fusible constituent,

The well-known alloy of sodium and potassium, which is liquid above
6° C., can be produced with great ease at ordinary atmospheric tem-
peratures. When freshly cut surfaces of the two metals are gently pressed
together, liquefaction begins at the points of contact, almost instantly,
aud spreads rapidly to completion. In short, it seems probable that all
alloys may be made from their components at temperatures little, if
any, in excess of their own melting points. (Zeitschr. Physikal. Chem.,
11, 379.)

The same alloy of sodium and potassium has also been investigated
thermo-chemically by Joannis, who prepared it by the usual method of
melting the two metals together under petroleum. The calorimetric
data given by the action of water upon this alloy, led Joannis to con-
clude that the only true compound among the sodium-potassium alloys
is represented by the formula NakK,. ‘Ann. de Chim. Phys. (6), x1,
358.)

The dehydration of metallic hydroxides by heat.—By experiments on
the temperature and rate of dehydration of hydrates corresponding to
sixteen metals, Carnelley and Walker conclude that Henry’s views con-
cerning the polymerization of metallic oxides are mainly true. They
find that when a precipitated hydrate is heated, it gradually loses water
with the successive formation of a large number of definite hydrates,
each of which is further decomposed on a small rise in temperature, with
the formation of a compound containing a smaller proportion of water.
As the elimination of water proceeds, the residual molecule becomes
larger and more complex, until at last a highly complex molecule of
anhydrous oxide is left, of which the formula is some multiple of that
generally received. Tor the oxides of silicon, titanium, and tin the coet-
ficient of polymerization must be at least ten, while oxide of zirconium
must be at least Zr.,O., and antimonious oxide at least Sb2pQs). The

H, Mis, 142-28
434 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

most infusible oxides are probably those in which the highest polymeri-
zation is reached.

The authors also connect the phenomena of dehydration with the
periodic curve, and reach the following conclusions :

(A.) As regards oxides belonging to the same group. In the case of
odd members the temperature of complete dehydration diminishes as the
atomie weight of the positive element increases. For even members the
reverse is true.

(B.) As regards oxides belonging to the same period, as from Li to
F, or from K to Br. Here the temperature of complete dehydration
seems to diminish from the beginning to about the middle of the period,
and then to increase as we approach its end. To this rule there are
only three apparent exceptions, and to the former rules there are none.
(Journ. Chem. Soe., L111, 59.)

The interaction of zine and sulphuric acid.—The ordinary reaction be-
tween commercial zine and dilute sulphuric acid is familiar to every one,
and it is also well known that the hydrogen evolved is sometimes con-
taminated with sulphur dioxide and sulphuretted hydrogen. Taken al-
together the re-actions are somewhat complicated, varying with different
qualities of zinc and different concentrations of acid. An interesting
qualitative study of the problem has been made by Muir and Adie, who
used six different forms of zinc, ranging from the commercial granu-
lated metal, through re-distilled zine, to platinized zine foil and zine
especially purified. The acid varied from H,SO, to H.SO,, 100H,O ap-
proximately.

In all the re-actions hydrogen was evolved,and zinc sulphate with some-
times free sulphur was the only solid product. Sulphur was liberated
only at relatively high temperatures, and by acids not less concentrated
than H,SO,, 2H,0, and its separation is always accompanied by evolu-
tion of sulphur dioxide and sulphuretted hydrogen ; although the quan-
tity of the latter was sometimes extremely small. When the specially
purified zine was used, hardly any sulphur was set free, but with plat-
inized foil it appeared in large quantities ; its formation being possibly
due to the mutual action of sulphuretted hydrogen and hot sulphurie
acid.

The purer the zine the smaller become the quantities of sulphur di-
oxide and sulphuretted hydrogen evolved at ordinary temperatures, and
when the acid is so dilute as H,SO,, 12H,O, hydrogen is almost the sole
gaseous product. The proportions of the other two gases vary with
purity of the zinc, concentration of acid, and temperature. With plat-
inized foil and concentrated acids, sulphur dioxide is generated at
a lower temperature than sulphuretted hydrogen, but the latter is pro-
duced the more freely of the two when the acid is dilute. With com-
mercial zine and H,SO,, 2H,0, little sulphur dioxide or sulphuretted
hydrogen appears at 100°; at 165° both gases are produced freely; at
180° torrents of the latter gas nearly free from the former are evolved,
CHEMISTRY. 435

With the specially purified zinc and the same concentration of acid both
gases are given off in quantity at 165°. The dependence of the produc-
tion of these gases upon temperature and concentration seems to indi-
cate that they are not altogether generated by any reducing action of
nascent hydrogen upon sulphuric acid. The authors regard the inter-
action in the case of pure zine and acid as chiefly chemical, and ascribe
the products evolved by less pure zines to secondary electrolytie
changes. Doubtless the actual re-actions are more complex than can
be shown by any system of equations at present. (Journ. Chem. Soe.,
LIII, 47.)

Absorption spectra of the rare earths.—Kriiss and Nilson, studying
the rare earths from thorite, wohlerite, cerite, fergusonite, euxenite, ete.,
have discovered various anomalies in their absorption spectra which
they ascribe to a greater elementary complexity than has commonly
been recognized. In place of the so-called erbium, holmium, thulium,
didymium, and samarium, they assume the existence of more than twenty
elements, each of the above-named substances giving spectra which
vary for each substance with differences of origin. For example, in the
earths from thorite, all the lines ascribable to holmium were seen, but
all faintly except one. Thatone, which was strong, is ordinarily oneof
the faintest. The lines which are commonly strongest were barely vis-
ible. Of earths from fergusonite a series of fractionations was made,
and in these similarly curious anomalies were noted. In certain por-
tions some lines belonging toa givenelement would appear, and others
would be wanting, and thus the supposed element was shown to be pre
sumably a mixture. For details, with wave lengths of the lines, the
original paper must be consulted. (Berichte, xx, 2154.)

To the foregoing conclusions of Kriiss and Nilson, Bailey objects.
As regards the relative intensity of absorption lines, he holds that the
several spectra in a mixture of earths modify each other, the propor-
tioned quantity of each earth affecting the problem decidedly. A strong
absorption band may hide a weaker one, and furthermore, differences
of dilution with respect to any given oxide will influence its spectrum.
Variations may also be due to the presence of reagents; as for instance,
as nitrate solutions were studied, an excess of nitric acid. (Berichte,
xx, 2769.)

To Bailey’s objections, Kriiss and Nilson publish a rejoinder, in which,
with other evidence, they state that their solutions contained only neu-
tral nitrates of the earths. (Berichte, xx, 3067.) Later, Bailey replies,
leaving the question still in doubt. (Berichte, xx, 3525.) The discus-
sion is continued in Berichte, xXx1, pp. 585, 1521, and 2019, and fur-
thur spectral investigations by Kiesewetter and Kriiss appear in the
same volume, p. 2510. In the latter paper the earths from keilhauite
and gadolinite are studied with results analogous to those given in the
first of the above-cited publications.

Elements and meta-elements.—In his address as president of the Chemi-
436 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

cal Society, in March, 1888, Crookes discusses at some length the nature
of the chemical elements, and considers the nature of the many doubt-
ful bodies contained in the so-called rare earths. Recognizing the
differences between the modifications of supposed elements developed
by fractional precipitation many times repeated, he does not regard
them as equal in rank to the broader differences which distinguish well-
characterized elementary bodies, and proposes the term “ meta-ele-
ments” as one well adapted to indicate their peculiar nature. In gen-
eral, he proposes to substitute for the word ‘‘ element,” as commonly
used, the expression ‘elementary group,” the meta-elements being the
closely similar components. In the original evolution of the elements
from * protyle” he conceives that there was a massing tendency of the
primeval atoms about certain nodal points in space. A cluster of par-
ticles, so formed, is a mass of that element whose atomic weight it rep-
resents, while the outlying particles of the cluster, varying in weight
form the average, and varying almost imperceptibly in properties, are
meta-elements. He further discusses the main problem in the light of
the periodic law, and replaces the ordinary tabular expression by a
lempiscate spiral, along which the atomic weights of the elements are
distributed.

INORGANIC.

The waters of the Yellowstone Park.—In Bulletin No. 47 of the U.S.
Geological Survey there is an elaborate investigation by Gooch and
Whitfield upon the waters of the Yellowstone Park. Forty-three of
these waters, mostly representing geysers and hot springs, were thor-
oughly analyzed, and found to be of remarkable interest. All of the
geyser waters are highly siliceous; all contain notable quantities of
borates ; all carry weighable amounts of arsenic and of lithia. In no
case was iodine detected, and bromine was found but rarely in very
small amounts. The main constituents, apart from the substances al-
ready named, were the usual sulphates, carbonates, and chlorides of
lime, magnesia, and the alkalies. None of the waters are markedly
chalybeate. As regards concentration, all are comparatively weak,
most of them carrying under 2 grammes of solid contents to the liter,
and not one reaching 4 grammes.

One of the springs, the Devil’s Ink Pot, is probably unique among
mineral waters. It contains 3.3871 gramines of dissolved matter in the
kilogramme of water, and of this 2.8185 grammes are ammonium sul-
phate. It also contains free sulphuric, boric, and hydrochloric acid,
some alum, a little sulphuretted hydrogen, and several metallic sul-
phates. No suggestion is offered concerning the origin of this water.
The bulletin contains full details as to the methods of analysis em-
ployed, and will be found valuable by other analysts on the score of
suggestiveness.

The chlorides of iodine.—According to Stortenbeker the only solid
CHEMISTRY. 437

chlorides of iodine are the trichloride, and two modifications, a and
f of the monochloride. The a compound crystallizes in long, red nee-
dles, melting at 279.2, while the / modification forms brownish red
lamellee, which fuse at 13°.9. <All these bodies can exist below their
points of fusion in liquid mixtures containing an excess of either ele-
ment, and varying in composition with temperature. In the gaseous
state only the molecule ICI. is possible, and it dissociates slightly at
80°; the trichloride dissociates completely in passing from solid to gas.
(Rec. Trav. Chim., vil, 152.)

The valency of boron.— Lorenz, from a study of the oxychlorides, con-
cludes that boron is trivalent. Neither of the compounds BOCI nor
BOC}, could be prepared; but a substance B,O;,Cl,, analogous in all
respects to several well-known salts of trivalent antimony, was obtained.
(Am. Chem., CCXLVII, 226.)

The same subject is also discussed by Georgievicz from other points
of view ; but with the same final conclusions. He points out as evidence
of the trivalency of boron the isomorphism of euclase and datolite, and
also describes a reaction by which when iodine is boiled with a solution
of borax, sodium iodate is formed. (Journ. Prakt. Chem. (2), XXXVII,
118.)

The preparation of boron.—The following method is proposed by S.
G. Rawson: A mixture of 34 parts of boron trioxide and 11 parts of
ealcium fluoride is treated in a flask with strong sulphurie acid. On
gently warming, a steady stream of boron fluoride is evolved, which is
then passed through a glass tube on which several bulbs have been
blown. In each bulb a small piece of potassium is placed, and these
are heated successively. Decomposition ensues with formation of po-
tassium fluoride and liberation of boron. Finally, the mass is thrown
on a filter and washed with water, boron remaining behind. Amor-
phous silicon may be easily prepared in a similar way. (Chem. News,
LVIII, 283.)

According to Hampe amorphous boron may also be prepared by the
electrolysis of fused borax between electrodes of platinum and gas
carbon. The free boron accumulates about the negative pole, and may
be separated from slag by means of water and hydrochioric acid.
(Berichte, xxI, ref. $27.)

The manufacture of aluminum.—Under the patents of Mr. H. G. Cast-
ner, of New York, the manufacture of aluminum has been begun at
Oldbury, near Birmingham, England. The process revolves itself into
four stages. First, sodium is produced from caustic soda by reduction
by means of iron carbide in steel retorts at a temperature of 800°.
From 6 pounds of caustic soda and 5 pounds of carbide 1 pound of
sodium is obtained at a cost of about 18 cents. <A residual product is
crude carbonate of soda of commercial value. Second, chlorine is pre-
pared by the Weldon process, the necessary hydrochloric acid being
supplied by the makers in return for the crude carbonate of soda above
438 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

mentioned. Third, by passing the chlorine over a heated mixture of
alumina, salt, and carbon, a double chloride of alurninum and sodium is
produced. Fourth, the aluminum is extracted by heating, in appropri-
ate furnaces, 80 pounds of the aforesaid double chloride, 25 pounds of
sodium, and 30 pounds of cryolite, the latter serving as a flux. The
charge is maintained for two hours at a temperature of 1,000°, and
yields about 8 pounds of aluminum containing not over 2 per cent. of
impurities. The present cost of the metal is from $10 to $12 a pound,
and under this process it is estimated that the price can be reduced to
about $1.25. (Chem. News, LVI1II, 64.)

Some products of the Cowles electric furnace.—The following observa-
tions are due to Prof. C. F. Mabery.

First, as to the reduction of aluminum from corundum: When that
mineral, mixed with charcoal, is submitted to the action of an electric
current in the furnace it fuses and reduction proceeds rapidly. The
liberated metal, vaporized, partly condenses in the upper layer of char-
coal, while part escapes into the air and is burned. The mixture of
carbon and metal contains from 10 to 50 per cent. of the latter. If sili-
con is present in the ore it is also reduced and the silicon alloys with the
aluminum in variable proportions up to 10 per cent. of the former. With
clay a similar reduction takes place, and when the alloy obtained is
treated with hydrochloric acid, crystalline or graphitoidal silicon is left
behind. The slags which are produced usually contain some metallic
aluminum, rarely iron, and almost no silicon. When corundum is re-
duced in presence of iron, the latter retains aluminum to a greater or
less extent. One product, which seems available for foundry purposes
and for introducing aluminum into steel, contains from 6 to 10 per cent.
of aluminum. It resembles in appearance a hard, fine-grained white
iron.

Secondly, as to the reduction of silicon. Sand is more easily reduced
in the furnace than corundum. It first fuses, and reduction immedi-
ately follows, yielding crystallized silicon. Copper mixed with the
charge dissolves the silicon up to 14 per cent., giving a bronze of re-
markable strength. The product obtained when silicon is reduced in
the absence of metals contains more or less of an amorphous greenish
substance of vitreous luster, which always occurs between the unre-
duced sand and the free silicon. In composition it appears to be the
hitherto unknown silicon monoxide, SiO. Its specific gravity is 2.893,
or somewhat higher than quartz. (Am. Chem. Journ., rx, 11.)

Alum in baking-powders.—In a series of experiments upon baking-
powders used in the United States, Professor Mallet has reached the
following conclusions: The greater part of the aluminous powders con-
tain alum, acid calcium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, and starch.
They give off very different proportions of carbon dioxide, and there-
fore require to be used in different amounts. Generally there is an ex-
cess of the alkaline ingredient in these powders, but sometimes the re-
CHEMISTRY. 43°

verse is true. On moistening the powders they yield small amounts of
valcium and aluminum in soluble form. After bread-making the pow-
ders containing acid calcium phosphate leave most of their alaminum
behind as phosphate, but when alum alone has been used the phosphate
is replaced by hydroxide. In baking, the interior of the loaf does not
exceed a temperature of 100° C., at which temperature neither the
aluminum phosphate nor the hydroxide is completely dehydrated. Both
of these compounds in doses not much exceeding the quantities found in
bread produce an inhibitory effect upon indigestion, this point having
been determined by personal experiments. That effect is probably due
to the fact that a part of the alumina unites with the acid of the gas-
tric juice and is taken into solution, while the remainder of the hydrox-
ide or phosphate precipitates the peptic ferment in insoluble form.
Partial precipitation of some of the organic matter of food may also be
brought about by the aluminum compounds in question. From all the
evidence Mallet concludes that not only alum itself, but also the resi-
dues which it leaves in bread, are unwholesome. (Chem. News, LVII,
276, 284.)

Aluminum in plants —It is commonly believed and asserted that flow-
ering plants do not contain aluminum as a normal constituent, although
one or two exceptions have been admitted. But Yoshida, on examin-
ing carefully selected and washed seeds of the pea, bean, rice, wheat,
barley, millet, and buckwheat, finds alumina present in the ash in every
case. The quantities found range from 0.053 per cent. in the ash of the
pea, Soja hispida, up to 0.272 per cent. in the ash of millet, Panicum
italicum. in the pea the cotyledons contain no alumina, while the ash
of the hull or skin contains 0.268 per cent. The figure given above re-
lates to the whole pea. (Journ. Chem. Soc., L1, 748.)

Silicon in iron and steel.—Thomas Turner, after a long and laborious
investigation, announces the following conclusions as to the influence
of silicon upon the properties of iron and steel:

Ingot iron containing silicon in all proportions up to 0.5 per cent.
rolls well and does not show any signs of red-shortness; it welds per-
fectly with all proportions of silicon, and, with the somewhat doubtful
exception of the 0.5 per cent. specimen, it is not brittle when cold.
With less than about 0.15 per cent. of silicon, the limit of elasticity, the
breaking load, the extension, and the reduction of area are but little, if
at all, affected by the proportion of silicon present. With over 0.15 per
cent. the limit of elasticity and breaking load are increased, though the
effect of silicon in this respect is not nearly so marked as that of ear-
bon. But the ductility is distinctly reduced and rendered more irregu-
lar by the presence of much silicon. The fracture is also rendered more
granular or crystalline, and is less regular in character. (Journ. Chem.
Soc., LUI, $24; continued from Lt, 129.)

The chemical structure of the natural silicates.—Under this heading
Olarke has summarized his views upon silicate structure, which vary
440 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND i888. :

somewhat from those which have been hitherto generally held. After
arguing in favor of simplicity of structure, he discusses a number of the
common aluminous silicates, and shows that the more complex of them
are easily represented as substitution derivatives of normal salts, alu-
minum itself being regarded as trivalent. Thus, from the normal ortho-
silicate of aluminum, xenolite, the species fibrolite, topaz, muscovite,
paragonite, eucryptite, dumortierite, grossularite, prehnite, and natro-
lite are simply derived, and in away which accords wel! with their
actual occurrences and alterations in nature. The paper concludes
witi the general hypothesis that all double salts are substitution deriv-
atives of normal compounds. (Am. Chem. Journ., x, 120.)

In alater number of the same journal (x, 405) E. A. Schneider shows
that the differences in the behavior of silicates toward hydrechloric acid
are in the same order as the differences pointed out in Clarke’s formula.

The constitution of the clays.—By a careful study of the thermal phe-
nomena attending the dehydration of many clays, Le Chatelier arrives
at the conclusion that they represent only five compounds, as follows:

FA BUOVSLTC = coo re ccinie eee taining LO eA Os: ai oelg Ohm eUC]s

Of these the last one is doubtful. (Zeitschr. Phys. Chem., 1, 396.)

Hydroxychlorides of titanium.—According to Koenig and Otto von der
Pfordten, dry, gaseous hydrochloric acid does not act upon titanium
tetrachloride. On the other hand, concentrated aqueous hydrochloric
acid acts upon the chloride, forming a series of hydroxy-derivatives,
which may be represented as follows: TiC],; TiC]OH; TiCl.(OH).;
TiCl(OH);. These compounds are called by the authors chlorides of
titanie acid, and all are solids. The monochloride is stable in the air;
the dichloride is very hygroscopic; the trichloride somewhat so. (Be-
richte, XxJ, 1708.)

Titanic acid in soils.—J. F. McCaleb has examined fourteen samples
of soil from central Virginia, together with one from Alabama and one
from Nevada, finding titanic oxide present in all in percentages ranging
from 0.33 to 5.42. Although this wide distribution of titaniam was rea-
sonably to be expected, it seems not to have been hitherto observed.
(Am. Chem. Journ., x, 36.)

Germanium.—Several papers upon this interesting new metal have
appeared, which identify it completely with the predicted * ekasilicium ”
of Mendelejeff. For the specific heat of the metal, between 0° and
440°, Nilson and Pettersson find 0.0757, which gives an atomic heat of
5.33. They also find normal values for the vapor density of GeCl,, Gel,
and GeS. (Berichte, xx, ref. 134.)

By Winkler several compounds of germanium are described, notably
a germanium chloreform, GeHOl,; germanium ethyl, Ge(C.Hs5),, and
CHEMISTRY. _ 441

a germanium ultramarine. The double fluorides of germanium are
strictly analogous to those of the other elements of the same group.
(Journ. Prakt. Chem. (2), xxxvi, 177.) The potassium germanifluo-
ride, K,GeF, is also studied by Nilson and Pettersson, who show its
analogies with the silicofluoride. Crystallographic measurements by
Paykull show it to be isomorphous with ammonium silicofluoride. (Be-
richte, Xx, 1696.) In euxenite Kriiss discovers about one-tenth of 1 per
cent. of germanium oxide. (Berichte, xx, 131.)

Hydrazin.—The compound N.H,, hydrazin or amidogen, of which
many derivatives have long been known, has at last been isolated by
Curtius. When diazoacetic ether is treated with hot, strong potash lye
the potassium salt of a new acid is formed. When this salt is treated
with a mineral acid the new diazo-acid is set free, which upon digestion
with dilute sulphuric acid deposits superb colorless crystals of hydrazin
sulphate. The latter by warming with caustic alkali solutions readily
yields up free hydrazin as a colorless, perfectly stable gas having a pe-
culiar odor slightly suggestive of ammonia. It dissolves easily in water
to a strongly alkaline solution, which acts as a powerful reducing agent,
precipitates alumina and other like bases from their salts, and unites
readily with acids. (Berichte, xx, 1632.)

The chloride of nitrogen.—This compound, which is perhaps the most
violent explosive known, has been recently investigated by Gatterman.
As obtained by the action of chlorine upon sal ammoniac solution, it
was found to be indefinite in composition and to contain various admix-
tures of chloramines. From tbis mixture the pure NC], was prepared
by first washing thoroughly with water in a separatory funnel and then
saturating for half an hour with a stream of chlorine. The oil so ob-
tained was thoroughly washed, dried, and analyzed and, was found to be
definite in composition. By careful manipulation it was prepared about
thirty times without explosion, and its reputedly capricious explosibility
was found to be due to the action of light. By flashing upon it the light
from burning magnesium it exploded violently. On careful heating up
to 90° it remains unchanged, but exploded with great force when the
temperature reached 95°. (Berichte, xx, 751.)

In a note upon the foregoing paper Mallet calls attention to the facet
that nitrogen iodide, which is not sensitive when wet, when dry also
detonates by exposure to bright sunlight. (Chem. News, Lym, 64.)

Thiophosphoryl fluoride—According to Thorpe and Rodger, when
phosphorus pentasulphide is heated with lead fluoride in a leaden tube
a gas is formed which analysis shows to be thiophosphoryl fluoride,
PSF;. It is also produced by several other re-actions, and is a trans-
parent, colorless, liquefiable gas. In contact with air it spontaneously
ignites, burning at a jet with a pale yellowish-green flame tipped with
blue. It dissolves in water, to some extent in ether, not at all in alco-
holor benzene. It has no action on mercury. (Jour. Chem. Soc., LII,
766.)
449 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 188s.

Amorphous antimony.—This modification of antimony, discovered by
Gore, is prepared by Hérard by heating antimony to dull redness in a
current of nitrogen. The grayish vapors condense at the cool end of
the tube in which the operation is performed, to an amorphous powder.
Its specific gravity is 6.22 and it melts at 614°, while ordinary erystal-
line autimony fuses at 440° and has a density of 6.73. (Compt. Rend.,
Cvit, 420.)

Decomposition of antimony sulphide by water.—Elbers finds that when
antimonious sulphide is boiled with water it is slowly decomposed with
evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen. In this way 0.05 gramme of sul-
phide was converted into oxide in fourteen hours, giving a liquid of
faintly alkaline re-action. (Jour. Chem. Soc., LVI, 108, from Chem.
Zeitung, X11, 350.)

Hydrochlorates of chlorides.—Three of these hitherto doubtful salts,
well crystallized, are described by Engel. They are (SbCI3).. HCI. 2H20 ;
SbCl;. 5HCl. 115.0; (BiCl,).. HCl. 3H,O. A similar copper salt, CuCh.
2HCI. 5H,0, also crystallized, is described by Sabatier. (Compt. Ren:!.,
CVI, 1724 and 1796.) The fluobydrates of potassium fluoride, KF.2HF
and KF.3HF, lately discovered by Moissan, may be analogous in con-
stitution. (Compt. Rend., cvt, 547.)

Pentathionic and herathionic acids —When sulphuretted hydrogen is
passed into an aqueous solution of sulphurous acid a milky liquid is
formed in which an acid called pentathionic acid is commonly believed
to exist. Its existence, however, having been called in question by
Spring, the question has been re-investigated by Debus with affirma-
tive results. According to Spring the pentathionic acid is merely a
physical solution of sulphur in tetrathionic acid, and the pentathionates
are mixtures of tetrathionates with free sulphur.

The original liquid from which pentathionic acid is obtained is known
as Wackenroder’s solution, and is a highly complex and unstable mix-
ture. Its properties were thoroughly studied by Debus, who explains
the anomalies which have troubled Spring and others, and who dis-
covers in it, besides tetra- and penta-thionie acids, still a new compound,
hexathionie acid, H,S,Os. He obtained well-erystallized and definite
pentathionates of potassium and copper, and also the potassium salt of
hexathionie acid, establishing the existence of both acids beyond all
reasonable question. He also found in the Wackenroder solution rather
large quantities of free sulphur in a new colloidal modification, soluble
in water. (Journ. Chem. Soc., Lu, 278.)

A new sulphur acid.—Villiers, studying the action of sulphur dioxide
upon sodium thiosulphate, finds that when the gas is passed into an ice-
cold solution of the latter salt a new sulphur acid is generated. If the
solution, after saturation, be allowed to stand for a few days and then
is evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid, crystals of the sodium salt,
Na,S,O,, are obtained. It crystallizes from water with 2H,O. From
the first mother liquor on further evaporation sodium trithionate crys-
CHEMISTRY. 443

tallizes out. For the new acid the name disulphopersulphurie is pro-
posed. (Compt. Rend., Cv1, 851 and 1354.) ~

Tellurium.—According to Berthelot and Fabre the trausformation of
amorphous tellurium into the erystalline variety is attended by an ab-
sorption of heat. In this particular it is the opposite of selenium.
Fabre finds that in its different modifications tellurium has sensibly
the same specific heat. Telluride of magnesium is easily prepared by
heating magnesium in dry hydrogen, and passing over it an excess of
tellurium vapor. It is a white, flaky substance, which, treated with
acidulated water, vields telluretted hydrogen, and the latter gas is so
upstable as to decompose immediately in contact with moist air. Its
heat of formation is negative. A number of metallic tellurides were
prepared and studied by Fabre thermo-chemically. Their heats of
formation were all positive, but less than in the case of the correspond-
ing selenides. (Ann. Chim. Phys. (6), x1v, 93, 110.)

Solution of tron in caustic soda.—When a strong current of air is
forced into a hot, concentrated solution of caustic soda contained in an
iron vessel, or in which finely divided ferric hydroxide is suspended,
noticeable quantities of iron are dissolved without coloration. At
ordinary temperatures the liquid remains clear and colorless for sev-
eral days, but ultimately becomes turbid and discolored, depositing fer-
ric hydroxide. This color or turbidity disappears upon heating. Zir-
nité, who describes the phenomenon, attributes it to the possible for-
mation of a sodium perferrate, NaFeO,. (Journ. Chem. Soc., LVI, 105;
from Chem. Zeitung, Xu, 355.)

Luteocobalt permanganate.—This salt, with several of its derivatives
intermediate between it and the chloride or bromide of luteocobalt, is
remarkable for being violently explosive, both upon heating and by
percussion. It forms many highly crystalline double salts of consider-
able stability. (IT. Klobb, Ann. Chim. Phys. (8), x1, 5.)

Electrolytic precipitation of copper.—According to Soret, dilute solu-
tions of copper, except with very weak currents, yield a spongy precipi-
tate of metal. The nature of the deposit depends not only on the in-
tensity of the electric current and on the concentration of the solution,
but also on the proportion of free acid which may be present. The
electrolytic copper always contains hydrogen, its amount depending
upon the temperature of the solution and its acidity. That hydrogen
is simply oceluded, not combined; and it sometimes contains traces of
carbonic anhydride and carbonic oxide. (Compt. Rend., cvu, 733.)

New platinum bases.—Dr. H. Alexander describes a number of com-
pounds, analogous to the platosamines, in which hydroxylamine replaces
ammonia. The platodioxamine, of which the chloride, PtCl.4NH,0,
corresponds to the chloride of Reiset’s base, forms a large series of selts,
in which alkalies precipitate an insolubie hydroxide, Pt(OF!)..4NH,O.
In this reaction the hydroxylamine base differs from all the other plati-
num bases so far known, (Ann. Chem., COXLVI, 239.)
444 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND i888.

By Biomstrand a remarkable series of platinum bases containing
organie radicles and sulphur are described. In one memoir he dis-
cusses the sulphin bases of methyl and ethyl, and in a second paper,
jointly with Rudelius and Léndabl, the propyl, isopropyl, butyl, iso-
butyl, and benzyl bases are considered. The platoethylsulphin chloride,
Pt=(S(C.H;)2Cl)2, may be cited as a representative of these new com-
pounds. (Journ. Prakt. Chem. (2), Xxxvuil, 345 and 497.)

Influence of impurities upon gold.—Roberts- Austen, of the British mint,
investigating the influence of small impurities upon gold, attempts to
correlate his observations with the periodic law. Those metals whose
atomic volumes exceed that of gold, when alloyed with the latter ele-
ment, diminish its tenacity. Silver, having nearly the same atomic
volume as gold, hardly affects its toughness at all. So far as the ex-
periments go, the toughness of gold is not lessened by any element
which stands below it in Meyer’s curve, while all the elements above
gold in the curve tend to make it brittle. (Berichte, XXI, ref. 508.)

Salts of gold —In the periodic system gold may be placed with almost
equal propriety either in line with the alkaline metals or in column
with the iron and platinum groups. Chemically, its relations suggest
the first-named grouping; physically, it is nearer platinum. In a for-
mer paper Kriiss has shown that aurous oxide, like the alkalies, is com-
pletely soluble in water, and now Hoffinann and Kriiss find a like state-
ment to hold good of aurous sulphide, which, when freshly prepared,
dissolves easily to a clear brown solution, from which it is precipitated
by hydrochloric acid and various salts. The trisulphide, Au,S; appears
not to exist, in spite of the common belief in its favor, but a sulphide,
Au,S,, is easily obtainable. The so-called trisulphide of chemical liter-
ature is a mixture of this auro-auric salt with free sulphur. (Berichte,
Xx, 2369 and 2704.)

In experiments upon the halogen compounds of gold Kriiss and
Schmidt conclude that Thomsen’s auro-auric salts, Au,Cl, and Au,Bry,
do not exist. When chlorine or bromine acts directly upon gold the
normal auric compound is produced, (Berichte, Xx, 2634.)

ORGANIC.

Higher paraffins from brown coal.—In the oil distilled from brown coal
Krafft has identified a number of the higher homologues of methane,
Fe bas isolated the members of the series from ©,;H3¢ to C2,;Hy; inelu-
sive, and finds them to be identical with the normal paraffins prepared
synthetically. Seven of them are described in detail. (Berichte, XX1,
2256.) In other papers Krafft studies aromatic compounds involving
pe eery and hexadecyl groups, such as hexadecyl benzene, ete. (Lbid.,
pp. 2265, 3180.)

The origin of petrolewm.—Although petroleum is generally believed to
be of organic origin, some writers, and notably Mendelejeff, have sought
to show its derivation from inorganic material, Evidence as to its ani-
CHEMISTRY. 445

mal origin is now furnished by the researches of C. Engler, who studied
the distillation of fish oil under favorable conditions. In a large appa-
ratus made for manufacturing purposes he distilled 492 kilogrammes of
menhaden oil, at a temperature of 350° to 400°, and under a pressure
of two atmospheres. Combustible gases were given off, and a liquid
distillate was obtained in two layers; the upper watery, the lower oily,
in character. The latter amounted to 299 kilogrammes, was brownish,
and had a strong green fluorescence. In brief, it resembled crude
petroleum ; and on fractional distillation it yielded pentane, hexane,
heptane, octane, and nonane, all of the normal series, together with
some secondary hydrocarbons. It was essentially an artificial petro-
leum.

As fish oilis mainly a mixture of triolein, tristearin, ete., Engler made
further experiments upon a similar distillation of these compounds,
although on a very much smaller scale, and obtained confirmatory re-
sults. The fact that petroleum contains no free carbon, which is cited
as evidence against its organic origin, he disposes of by showing that
if all the oxygen in the glycerides of fatty oils should combine with
part of their hydrogen to form water, the residue would still contain 87
per cent. carbon and 13 per cent. hydrogen, which is almost exactly the
average composition of natural petroleum. (Berichte, xx1, 1816.)

Metallocyanides of ethyl—The ferrocyanide, (C,H;), FeCy,s, is de-
scribed by Freund, who prepared it by acting upon silver ferrocyanide
with ethyl iodide. Reerystallized from chloroform it forms iarge rhom-
bie crystals. Freund also makes some observations on von Than’s
alleged platinocyanide of ethyl. (Berichte, xxt, 931 and 937.)

Oxymethylene and formaldehyde.—Tollens and Mayer, attempting to de-
termine the molecular weight of oxymethylene by Raoult’s method, find
that upon solution in water it is converted into formaldehyde. The
latter, in dilute solution, did not undergo polymerization, even after six
months’ standing, nor was it expelled upon heating; this fact being ex-
plained by its transformation, in concentrated solution, into a polymer
(CH,O),. Upon standing, this di- or paraformaldehyde quickly disso-
ciates at ordinary temperature into formaldehyde. The oxymethylene,
which is with difficulty soluble, is probably metaformaldehyde (CH,Q);.
(Berichte, xx1, 1566 and 3503.)

Diacetyl_—By acting upon nitrosomethyiacetone with a solution of
sodium bisulphite, H. v. Pechmann has prepared a compound which
appears to be diacetyl, CH;.CO.CO.CH;. It is a volatile liquid boil-
ing at 87° to 88°, having a yellowish-green color, and an odor like crude
acetone. Its vapor resembles chlorine in tint. Homologues of nitro-
somethylacetone, similarly treated, yield homologues of diacetyl. (Be-
richte, XX, 3162.)

In a later paper Pechmann and Otte describe acetyl-butyryl, acetyl-
isobutyryl, acetyl-isovaleryl, acetyl-isocaproyl, and acetyl-crotonyl.

The fatty acids of the drying oils —Norton and Richardson, in an
investigation of linoleic acid prepared from linseed oil, have come to the
conclusion that it is a mixture. About three-fourths of the original
sample proved to be volatile, distilling under reduced pressure at 290°
C. Ricinoleic acid exhibits a similar volatility, the non-volatile resi-
due amounting to about one-fourth of the sample, and solidifying upon
cooling. The volatile parts of the two acids appear to be identical, and
to agree with the formula CH O.. Further investigation is prom-
ised. (Am. Chem. Journ., x, 59 )

Tests for fats and oils.—This subject has been elaborately studied by
Prof. H. W. Wiley, in the laboratory of the United States Department
of Agriculture. On account of the increase in the use of cotton-seed oil
as an adulterant of other oils, and in the manufacture of imitation lard
and butter, he has paid special attention to its detection, and finds that
Bechi’s test for itis the most trustworthy. That test is based upon the
fact that of all the fatty oils, cotton-seed oil alone is able to reduce salts of
silver. First, a solution of silver nitrate in water is prepared, to which
a large proportion of aleohol and ether is added. Secondly, a mixture
of amyl alcohol and rapeseed oil is provided. Onadding to a suspected
oil, first the silver solution and then the amyl alcohol preparation, and
heating upon the water bath, the cotton-seed oil is readily detected. If
it is present a color varying from brownish to black is developed, in con-
sequence of the deposition of metallic silver.

With the aid of Abbe’s refractometer, he has also studied the refrae-
tive indices of many fats and oils, finding such wide differences between
them as to justify the use of the instrument in the discovery of adultera-
tions or the identification of samples. (Journ. Anal. Chem., 1, 275 and
277.)

The composition of Japanese bird-lime.—This substance, which is pre-
pared like European bird-lime from a species of holly, is extensively
used in Japan for catching birds and insects. According to Divers and
Kawakita it contains, apart from mechanical impurities, such as_ bark
and dirt, some lime salts, caoutchoue, and a number of interesting
organic compounds. Upon saponification with alcoholic potash it yields
the potassium salts of palmitic acid and of a semi-solid acid not farther
identified, a resinoid substance, and two crystalline alcohols. The latter
are named mochylie and ilicylie alcohols and melt at 234° and 1729, re-
spectively. Mochylie alcohol is represented by the formula C.,H4O,
while ilicylie alcohol is C..H,,0. The ilicie alcohol, obtained by Per-
sonne from European bird-lime is C,;H,,O, and, being made from a dif-
ferent species of holly, is probably a distinct compound. The three
alcohols are homologous, and belong in a series having the general
formula C,,H>, ;O. The resinoid constituent of Japanese bird-lime has
the composition C,,H,,O, differing from mochylic alcohol by having two
atoms less of hydrogen. (Journ. Chem. Soc., LI, 268.)

A solid hydrecarbon in plants,—Helen ©, de 8. Abbott and H. Trimble,
CHEMISTRY. 447

in the petroleum ether extract from Cascara amarga and Phlox Caro-
lina, have discovered a solid, crystalline hydrocarbon, melting at 196°.
In composition it is represented by the formula C,,;H\., or some multiple
thereof. (Berichte, Xx1, 2598.)

The synthesis of closed carbon chains.—During 1887 and 1888, W. H.
Perkin, jr., has published a number of papers extending his earlier
researches upon compounds containing closed carbon chains. In some
of these papers he appears in joint authorship with other investi-
gators.

By acting upon ethyl malonate in presence of sodium with trimethy-
lene bromide a number of tetramethylene derivatives were formed, but
the hydrocarbon itself could not be prepared. In the same reaction
some pentamethylene derivatives were also produced. By other pro-
cesses compounds involving hexa- and hepta-methylene were obtained.
Some work was also done on trimethylene derivatives, and also on the
synthesis of aromatic compounds having closed carbon chains. (See
Perkin, Journ. Chem. Soe., L1, pp. 1, 240, 702, 849, and Li, 1; Colman
and Perkin, ibid., LI, 228, and Lu, 185; Freer and Perkin, ibid., L1, 820,
and Li, 202, 215.) The aromatic compounds were also studied by
Kipping, ibid., L111, 21. None of these papers are suited for detailed
abstraction.

A new general method of synthesis for aromatic compounds.—Friedel
and Crafts, continuing their researches upon the re-actions of aromatic
hydrocarbons in presence of aluminum chloride, find that the latter
re-agent causes benzene and its homologues to take up readily various
elements, radicles, and acid anhydrides. Thus, when dry oxygen is
passed into a mixture of benzene with aluminum chloride, it is slowly
absorbed; and upon treating the mass with water phenol is formed.
Toluene, similarly treated, yields cresol. The benzene and chloride
mixture easily takes up powdered sulphur, with evolution of hydro.
chloric and sulphydric acids, and afterwards, with water, gives phe-
nyl mercaptan, phenyl sulphide, and diphenylene disulphide. With
carbonic anhydride the same fundamental mixture yields benzoie acid,
with sulphur dioxide it gives benzylsulphurous acid, and so on through
a long list of similar reactions. Inevery casc, however, treatment with
water is necessary to complete the re-action.

In all these syntheses, according to the authors, the first step appears
to be the formation of a peculiar organo-metallic compound, as follows:

C;He+ Al,Clg=C>5H;.Al.C],+ HCl.

This compound, C, Hs. Al, Cl;, being formed, it is readily acted upon by
various agents, as, for example, by the paraffin chlorides, in-which case
hydrocarbon derivatives are produced with regeneration of aluminum
chloride, thus:

O,H;.Al,Cl;-+ CH,Cl=C,H;.CH,+ Al.Cl.
448 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

This order of syntheses is discussed in previous papers. In the present
essay the reactions are but little more complex. In the first case, in
which oxygen is taken up to form phenol, the equations are as follows:

C;H.+-0-+- AlLOl,—0,Hs.0.A1L,CL + HO},

an oxygenated compound being formed which, upon treatment with
water, is destroyed and phenol is generated.

C,;H;.0.A1],01];+ H,O0 =C,H;0H-+ Al,Cl;(OH ye

The definite addition compounds of aromatic hydrocarbons and aluini-
num chlorides which were some time ago described by Gustavson, Frie-
del and Crafts were unable to prepare. Instead they obtained variable
mixtures. They describe, however, a definite alaminum-phenyl, which
serves asa starting point for still other syntheses. (Ann. Chim. Phys.
(6), XIV, 433.)

The application of aluminum chloride to organic syntheses in the
fatty series has also been studied by Combes (ibid., x11, 199), with ref-
erence to diphenyl by Adam (ibid., xv, 224), and in connection with
naphthalene derivatives by Roux (ibid., x11, 289).

Inosite.—This substance, isomeric with glucose, has been elaborately
studied by Maquenne. With acids it yields ethers which prove it to
be a hexatomie alcohol, while with reducing and oxydizing agents it
gives derivatives belonging in the aromatic series. Its constitution,
therefore, seems to be “hexagonal” like that of benzene; but the evi-
dence leads Maquenne to suppose that it contains no double bonds and
is to be regarded rather as a derivative of hexamethylene. As existing
in plants it is perhaps an intermediary between the fatty and the aro-
matic compounds, and one of the sources from which the natural ben-
zene derivatives originate. (Am. Chim. Phys. (6), xtt, 80.)

Perseite—Maquenne, in a new research upon this carbohydrate, finds
by Raoult’s method that its molecular weight is represented by the
formula C,H,,0O5. It acts as a hexatomic alcohol, and its hexacetate,
hexnitrate, ete., are described. (Compt. Rend., CVI, 1235.)

In a later paper Maquenne revises his former conclusions, and shows
that perseite is really a heptavalent alcohol of formula C,;H,,O; On
treatment with boiling hydriodie acid it yields heptine, C;H,. (Compt.
xend., CVII, 583.)

Graminin and phlein.—Two new carbohydrates, isomeric with inulin,
are given the above names by Ekstrand and Johanson. The first is de-
rived from the rhizomes of Trisetum alpestre ; the second from Phlewm
pratense. (Berichte, xx, 594.)

Cadaverin.—This base, derived from putrefaction, has been identified
by Ladenburg as pentamethylenediamine. Both cadaverin and the
synthetic compound form the same double salt with mercuric chloride.
(Berichte, XxX, 2217.)
CHEMISTRY. 449

Putrescin.—This compound, analogous to cadaverin, has been identi-
fied with tetramethylenediamine by Udranzky and Bawmann, (Berichte,
XXI, 2938.)

Identity of the naphtenes with the aromatic hexhydrides.—In 1883 Mar-
kownikoff and Ogloblin obtained from Caucasian petroleum a series of
hydrocarbons isomeric with the aromatic hexhydrides, to which they
gave the name of naphtenes. Konovaloff, studying the hexhydro-
pseudocumene, which he prepared synthetically from pseudocumene,
finds it to be in all respects identical with nononaphtene, and concludes
that the supposed naphtenes, as an independent series of hydroear-
bons, do not exist. (Berichte, xx, ref. 570.)

Action of pyridine on metallic salts.—The observations of Jorgensen
upon metallic pyridine compounds have been extended to a number of
new cases by Lang. When pyridine in excess is added to a solution of
zine chloride, a voluminous white precipitate is formed. This dissolves
in boiling water with which pyridine has been mixed and erystallizes
out in long silky needles having the composition ZnCl,.2C;H;N. It is
recrystallable from boiling alcohol, but water decomposes it into free |
pyridine and a basic chloride.

From an alcoholic solution of copper chloride pyridine precipitates
magnificent bluish-green needles of CuCl,.2Cs;H;N. With copper sul-
phate dissolved in water, pyridine produces a heavy, light green pre-
cipitate, which dissolves in excess of the reagent. From the latter so-
lution alcohol throws down the compound CuSO,.C;H;N.3H20, which
is essentially the normal sulphate with two of its water molecules
replaced by one of the organic base. Cuprous chloride treated with
pyridine in absence of air reacts so strongly that the mixture becomes
boiling hot. Upon cooling the solution, erystals of Cu,Cl,.4C;H;N are
deposited. With great excess of pyridine, six molecules are taken up,
forming the salt Cu,Cl,.6C;H;N in long, greenish-yellow needles.

With an alcoholic solution of cadmium chloride, pyridine precipi-
tates the salt CdCl,.2C;H;N. <A similar salt, highly erystallized, is
also formed by cadmium iodide. With mercurie chloride a compound
HeCl,.C;H;N is produced. Anhydrous cadmium chloride absorbs three
molecules of pyridine with evolution of heat. Other salts of cobalt
chloride, ferrous sulphate, and nickel sulphate with pyridine were also
prepared.

(Berichte, xxI, 1678.)

Pyridin and piperidin.—In a paper of nearly a hundred pages, Lad-
enburg presents the collected results of recent investigations made
partly by himself and partly by students under his direction, coneern-
ing the preparation and properties of the pyridin, and piperidin bases.
The compounds were partly syuthetic, and in part derived from tar
oil, and embrace pyridin, three methylpyridins, two ethylpyridins,
isopropylpyridin, two dimethylpyridins, three methylethylpyridinus, di-
ethylpyridin, and the corresponding members of the piperidin series,

450 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

(Ann. Chem.,CCXLVII,1.) Some higher homologues of the same series,
synthetically prepared, are also described by Jaeckle. (Ibid., CCXLVI,
32.)

A new base from tea.—Under the name theophylline, A. Kossel de-
scribes a new alkaloid which occurs with caffeine, but in very small quan-
tities, in tea. Its formula, C;H,;N,O,, makes it isomeric with theobro-
mine and paraxanthine; from which bases, however, it distinctly differs.
Unlike theobromine, it crystallizes with one molecule of water, and in
crystalline form it is unlike either of its isomers. It melts at 264°,
while paraxanthine melts at above 280°, and theobromine sublimes
without fusion at 290°. Its salts crystallize well. As it is convertible
into caffeine by methylization, it is doubtless a dimethylxanthine, but
the position of its methyl groups is not yet determined. (Berichte, XXt,
2164.)

Some homologues of cocaine.—Starting from cocaine as methyl-benzoyl-
ecgonine, F. G. Novy has prepared the corresponding ethyl, propyl,
and isobutyl compounds, of which the first had already been described
by Merck. In each case benzoyl-ecgonine was heated in a sealed tube
with the proper alkyl iodide and the corresponding alcohol. The new
alkaloids and their salts erystallize easily, and all possess like cocaine
strong anesthetic properties. (Am. Chem. Journ., xX, 145.)

Isatropyl cocaine.—This alkaloid, discovered by Liebermann, was ob-
tained as a bye-product in the extraction of cocaine from coca leaves.
It is amorphous, forms amorphous salts, and has the composition rep-
resented by the formula C,,H,;NO, Upon prolonged treatment with
hydrochioric acid tt is easily split up into methyl alcohol, ecgonine, and
two isomeric isatropie acids, C,H,O,. In constitution it is probably a
cocaine, in which the benzoic radicle is replaced by one from isatropie
acid. Physiologically, the new alkaloid is highly poisonous, differing
from cocaine and atropine, and acting mainly on the heart. (Berichte,
XXI, 2342.)

The alkaloids of areca nut.—From the areea or betel nut Jahns has
obtained two new alkaloids. The first,earecoline, C;H,;NOk,, is a color-
less, oily liquid of strong alkaline reaction, which boils at about 220°.
Its salts are easily soluble, and mostly erystallizable. It appears to be
the physiologically active principle of the nut, and to be near pelletier-
ine in its properties. The second alkaloid, arecaine, -C;H,,NO).H,0,
forms colorless, easily soluble crystals, whose solution reacts neutral.
It loses its water at 100°, melts at 215°, and chars upon stronger heat-
ing. Physiologically it is inactive. Probably it is related to betaine.
(Berichte, XX1, 5404.)

Atropine and hyoscyamine.—Ladenburg, investigating the isomerism
of these two alkaloids, concludes that it is *‘ physical” in character,
and that they are related to each other like tartaric and racemie acids,
atropine being the inactive compound optically. The actual transfor-
mation of one into the other is yet to be accomplished, the supposed
CHEMISTRY. 451

change heretofore having been deceptive, on account of impurities in
the atropineexamined. (Berichte, xx1, 3065.)

Coloring matter from Drosera Whittakeri.—From the tubers of this
South Australian plant Rennie has isolated a magnificent red coloring
matter which dyes silk brilliantly. It crystallizes easily from solution
in hot alcohol or glacial acetic acid, and has the formula C;,H;0;. From
experiments upon the oxidation and reduction of the compound, Ren-
nie infers that it may be a tribydroxy-methylnaphthaquinone. (Jour.
Chem. Soc., L1, 371.)

The supposed identity of rutin and quercitrin.—These two tinctorial
substances approximate to each other so nearly in properties and com-
position, that the question of their identity or distinctness has not
hitherto been settled. By the action of strong acids both are decom-
posed into quercetin and isodulcite, they dye similar colors, and have
many properties in common. Schunek now points out a number of
differences in physical characteristics and reactions, and by careful
analyses shows that whereas quercitrin contains two molecules of iso-
dulcite to one of quercetin, rutin has three of isodulcite to one of
quercetin. The differences and similarities are thus easily explained.
(Jour. Chem. Soce., LI, 262.)

The fluorides of the paraffin radicles.—Several of these compounds
have been prepared and described by Mcissan, partly in co-operation
with Melsans. They are produced by acting on silver fluoride with the
paraffin iodides, and up to isobutyl fluoride they are gaseous at ordi-
nary temperatures. Methyl fluoride is a colorless gas of extreme sta-
bility, which is saponifiable only with difficulty. It can be liquefied in
Cailletet?’s apparatus. The ethyl compound liquefies at —48, under
normal pressure, and isobutyl fluoride becomes liquid at +16°. The
gases are combustible, and burn witha blue flame. (Compt. Rend., CVI,
260, 992, 1155.) :

The action of fluoride of silicon upon organic bases.—By acting upon
aniline, orthotoluidine, paratoluidine, diphenylamine, dimethylaniline,
and chinoline with silicon fluoride, Comey and Jackson have prepared
a series of compounds which they designate silicotetrafluorides. In
these compounds the nitrogen appears to be quinquivalent, one of its
bonds being satisfied by fluorine and another by silicon. (Am. Chem.
Jour., X, 165.)

Other organic fluorine compounds, substitution derivatives of the
aromatic series, are described by Wallach and Heusler. Among them
are difluobenzene, parafluoanilin, fluonitrobenzene, paratluophenol, fluo-
pseudocumene, fluodiphenyl, ete. (Ann. d. Chem., CCXLIII, 219.)

Organo-metallic compounds.—The question as to the valency of bismuth
is settled by the researches of Michaelis and Polis on bismuth triphenyl.
This compound unites directly with two atoms of chlorine or bromine,
to form halogen saits in which the metal is definitely pentavalent. (Be-
richte, Xx, 54.)
452 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

On the other hand Marquardt has studied the trimethyl], triethyl, tri-
isobutyl, and triisoamyl compounds of bismuth. These only form salts
by replacement of the alkyl radicle, which are compounds of the di- and
monoalkyl compounds, the bismuth remaining triad throughout. (Be-
richte, XxX, 1516, and XXI, 2035.)

The tetraphenyl and tetratoly] lead compounds have also been studied
by Polis. The derivatives of lead tetrapheny] are salts of the diphenyl
compound, being formed by replacement and not by addition. (Be-
richte, xx, 717 and 3331.)

By Marquardt and Michaelis we have a research upon tellurethy).
When zine ethyl acts on tellurium tetrachloride, the monochloride of
tellurium triethyl is formed. Tellurium tetrethyl probably does not
exist. Tellurium diethyl is also described. (Berichte, Xx1, 2042.)

By Michaelis and Weitz trianisylarsine and its compounds and also
triphenetylarsine are described. In these bodies the arsenic remains
trivalent throughout. (Berichte, xx, 48.)

A silico-organic compound of a new type.—When silicon tetrabromide
or tetrachloride is added to an excess of aniline diluted with three or
four volumes of benzene, silicotetraphenylamide is produced. By dis-
tilling off the excess of benzene on a water bath, and crystallizing the
residue from solution in warm carbon disulphide, magnificent colorless
prisms of the new compound are obtained. According to the dis-
coverer, Prof. J. Emerson Reynolds, its formula is Si(NHC,H;),, and
it seems to be the first well-defined compound in which silicon is in di-
rect and exclusive union with amidie nitrogen. About 50 grammes of it
were shown at the meeting of the British Association at Bath. (Chem.
News, LVIII, 272.)

The action of micro-organisms upon nitric acid.—Upon cultivating
thirty-two species of micro-organisms in sterilized solutions containing
nitrates, Percy Frankland found a great difference in their power of re-
ducing nitric to nitrous acid. Sixteen or seventeen of the species pro-
duced the reduction more or less completely, while the remaining fifteen
or sixteen were quite destitute of the power. In no case did the reduc-
ing action lead to the formation of any noteworthy amount of ammonia.
With two of the more powerful organisms the quality of nitrate reduced
to nitrite in a given time was found to depend on the proportion of or-
ganic matter—peptone and sugar—present in the solution; the peptone
exerting far more influence than the sugar. None of the organisms ex-
amined were capable of oxidizing ammoniacal nitrogen—present as
anmonium chloride—to nitric or nitrous acids. (Journ. Chem, Soc., LIII,
373.)

The same subject is also discussed by Warington, who made numer-
ous experiments with pure cultures. He studied their action upon urea,
upon milk, and upon nitrates, using in all twenty seven micro-organ-
isms, many of them being well known as pathogenic.- Considering his
own results in connection with those of Frankland and others, as re-
CHEMISTRY. 453

gards the nitrifying power of organisms, he concludes that no oue who
has worked with isolated bacteria has qbtained more than a mere tr.ce
of nitric or nitrous acid in ammoniacal solutions. On the other hand,
the mixed organisms present in arable soil produce distinct and com-
plete nitrification in ammoniacal liquids containing twenty-five parts of
nitrogen in the million. Of twenty-five organisms studied, sixteen re-
duced nitrates with considerable vigor, and seven were entirely destitute
of reducing capacity. The reduction was from nitrates to nitrites, and
not to nitrogen. (Journ. Chem. Soc., LI, 727.)

The chemistry of jish.—Atwater has published in the form of a pre-
liminary notice the results of his elaborate analyses of the flesh of
American food-fishes. One hundred and twenty-two specimens belong-
ing to fifty-two species were examined, together with two European
fishes, and an account of the methods of analysis is included in the
statement. The results are given in the form of elaborate tables, which
are not suitable for abstraction. (Amer. Chem. Journ., 1x, 421, and x, 1.)

GENERAL WORK IN MINERALOGY.

The wide interest felt during the last few years in the general sub-
ject of microscopical mineralogy, and the advance made in this field,
are well shown by the number of new works that have recently ap-
peared which are devoted to this line of research. It has been in the
allied department of petrography that the work has been most actively
done and the progress made, but the result has been to bring about a
most important advance in the instruments and methods of study ap-
plied to mineralogy proper. The worksof Rosenbusch and Zirkel, (1873,)
were the pioneers in this direction, and since then the workers have
been many and the progress made rapid. A second edition of the work
of Rosenbusch was published in 1885, and now an English edition! has
been given to students in this country and England by J. P. Iddings.
In this translation the original work appears in somewhat abridged
form, but not so much so as to diminish its value, while making it rather
more convenient of use. All that is essential has been retained, in-
cluding the large number of fine plates of microphotographs. “A nother
work of similar character is that of Rutley.2. The methods of studying
minerals with the microscope are given systematically, with the charac-
ters especially of those species which enter into the formation of rocks.
A book of rather wider scope and more profound character is that of
Michel-Lévy and Lacroix. The first author has already made impor-
tant contributions in this field, and the Mineralogie micrographique by
Fouqué and M.-Lévy (1879) is one of the most exhaustive memoirs that
has been published. In the present volume the author introduces some
of the results of his former labors; for instance, on the variation of the

angle of extinction in crystal sections cut in different directions, and
other related subjects. The first part is thus theoretical ; the second
gives a concise summary of the characters, chiefly physical, of rock-
making mineral species. This part of the work contains many original
observations by the authors of the optical constants, indices of refrae-
tion, absorption, and soon. Rosenbusch has also issued a set of tables
giving in compact form the microscopical characters of all important
minerals;! these will be found of great practical use by the worker in
this line of research.

Related to the works mentioned is that of Teall on British Petrog-
raphy, an extended and well illustrated volume, but too exclusively pet-
rographical to eall for more than simple mention, Other important pet-
rographical works are those of Rosenbusch (Die massigen Gesteine, 1887)
and Roth (Allg. und chemische Geologie, vol. 2, 1887).

The work of Goldschmidt? on Crystallography and the forms of erys-
talline minerals is without question the most extended which has ever
been undertaken in this field. The author has developed a new sys-
tem of crystallographic notation, simply related to those in common use,
and designed to exhibit especially the relations of the forms of a erys-
tal as given in the projection. In connection he hasdeveloped a method
of calculation adapted to this notation, and further has given a thorough
discussion of the various systems that have been in use from the ear-
liest time down. This forms the first halt of the first volume, after
which begins the work proper, namely, the catalogne for each species
of all the planes that have been observed with the literature, the letters
and other notation of different authors, the equations for transforma.
tion,andsoon. The species are arranged alphabetically, and the whole
work is to consist of three large volumes. The working mineralogist
will profit to no small degree from the author’s labors, though the fact
that neither figures nor angies are given, atid that theoretical consid-
erations have often led to a variation from the commonly accepted
method for the orientation of the crystals of a species will restrict its
usefulness.

Several volumes on local mineralogy have recently appeared. The
Russian Mineralogy * of von Kokscharof has now entered upon its tenth
volume, and although the veteran author celebrated his fiftieth anni-
versary of active service in 1887 he is still carrying forward his labors
with vigor. The present state of knowledge in regard to. the mineralogy
of India is well presented by I’. R. Mallet,’ in a volume devoted to this

subject, and forming volume tv of the Geology of India. Except in
certain special directions, the mineral wealth of this country is but par-
tially developed, and much remains to be done, particularly on the
scientific side. Progress will be stimulated and directed by this excel-
lent volume. A large volume has been prepared by Liversidge! on the
mineralogy of New South Wales, being an extension of earlier publica-
tions, by the author on the same subject. it isa handsomely published
work, with a large colored map of that part of Australia, and giving a
detailed scientific account of the local mineralogy. The paragraphs
on the discovery and occurrence of gold, diamonds, tin ore, and similar
subjects will be consulted with especial interest. °

The volumes on the mineral resources of the United States for 1886
and 1887,? the fourth and fifth of the series, are too well known in
character and scope to need to be described at length. They have been
edited by David T. Day, with the assistance of various persons in special
fields, and present very fully the present state of the development of the
economic minerals and mineral industries of this country. The tabu-
lated list of localities at which useful minerais are being and have been
mined, prepared by A. Williams, and notes on localities of precious
stones, by G. F. Kunz, may be mentioned as of particular mineralogical
interest.

A mineralogical report for California for 1886 bas been issued by H.
G. Hanks, and two other volumes for 1887 and 1888, by William Irelan,
jr. Seaechi has published a list of the large number of species that have
been identified or newly discovered—and in great part by himself—at
the wonderfully active laboratory of Vesuvius. A list of the large num-
ber of minerals from the neighborhood of New York City has been pub-
lished by the late B. F. Chamberlin. Some other mineralogical works
to be noted are the following: The Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology,
fourth edition (1887), by James D. Dana. The Grundriss der Edelstein-
kunde, by Paul Groth (1887). A Chapter in the History of Meteorites,
by the late Walter Flight (1887). The Mineral Physiology and Physi-
ography, by T.Sterry Hunt, presents the author’s theoretical views as to
mineral classification and relationship. A new mineralogical periodical
was commenced in 1887, called Rivista di Mineralogia e Cristallografia
Italiana, edited by R. Panebianco, at Padua.

trapezohedral-tetartohedral division like quartz, with the consequent
power of circular polarization, has been recently studied by A. Schmnidt,!
and later by H. Tranbe,? on the morphological side. The material ex-
amined was from Mount Avala, near Belgrade, in Servia, and the crystals
have afforded a considerable number of new forms, especially among the
trapezohedrons. These trapezohedral planes are largely developed, thus
exhibiting this character of the species. On the rhombohedral side the
tetartohedral species, tourmaline,’ dolomite, and phenacite® have been
studied by Ramsay, Becke, and Penfield, respectively. The tetartohe-
dral character of tourmaline was shown in 1871 by the Russian miner-
alogist, Jerofeieff, who published a long paper upon the Russian species.
This paper, however seems to have been for the most part overlooked
by later wiiters. Solly (1884) deseribes a crystal from Pierrepont, New
York, with tetartohedral development of planes, and Ramsay shows that
there is 10 question in regard to this point. The crystals examined by
him were from Ramfos and Snarum, in Norway, and exhibited the tetar-
tohedral character in the distribution of the planes and the asymmetric
form of the etching figures.

Becke’s monograph upon dolomite is an important contribution to our
knowledge of that species, giving a number of new forms, chiefly of the
tetartohedral character, that is rhombohedrons of the third series, and
establishing the right or left handed character of all these planes, as has
not been attempted before. He also describes the vicinal planes, and
the various methods of twinning with a large number of figures. Other
crystals of dolomite, also exhibiting these tetartohedral forms have
been described by A. Sella in a paper upon erystals of the rare mag-
nesium fluoride, sellaite,® named in honor of his father Quintino Sella.

The phenacite crystals of Mount Antero, Colorado, are described and
figured by Penfield; they are interesting since a tetartohedral form,
that is, a rhombohedron of the third series is often the predominating
form and terminates the crystals sometimes alone. An earlier account
of these crystals was given by Des Cloizeaux. A somewhat related sub-
ject is the crystallization of the two ruby silvers, pyrargyrite and prous.
tite, studied exhaustively on the historical side a few years ago by Reth-
wisch and now receiving new contributions from the original work of
Miers.?. He decides upon slightly different angles for the fundamental
rhombohedron from those of Rethwisch (viz, 71° 22’ pyrargyrite, 72° 12/
proustite) and questions his conclusion as to the relation of this angle
to the composition. The study of the fine series of specimens in the
British Museum has enabled him to add upwards of twenty new forms

to the already long catalogue for the two species, and others that are
not certain. He also distinguishes between the characteristic forms of
pyrargyrite and proustite, not often attempted before, and develops
the hemimorphic nature of the two species.

A study of some specimens of polianite from Platten, Bohemia,! has
led to the interesting conclusion that the anhydrous MnO, erystallizes in
the tetragonal system and is isomorphous with rutile (TiO) cassiterite
(SnO,) and zircon (SiO,, ZrO,). The fact that the hard, gray manganese
ore, polianite, was distinet from the soft pyrolusite was long ago insisted
upon by Breithaupt, and his view is thus fully sustained. Flint has
extended his eariier erystallographic studies and has given valuable
contributions ov scolecite, braunite, hausmannite, and other species
from Sweden. The crystals of rutile,2 apatite, and beryl, of Alexander
County, North Carolina, are described by Hidden and Washington and
shown to have a number of interesting features. Some of the species of
the chrysolite group have been studied by Bauer? and the relation be-
tween their forms and composition brought out. The species especially
considered are chrysolite, hyalosiderite, and the magnesium silicate
forsterite. Crystals of kaolinite,* rarely obtained in 9 form allowing of
study, have been described by Allan Dick and their form measured and
figured by H. Miers. A monocliuic parameter is assigned to them, Viz:

ay Paes eT Gi es tee, A T2Gb B= 830 1M

The kaolinite from Colorado® was recently referred to the triclinice
system of Reusch on the pasis of an optical examination. The subject
of the crystallization of ullmannite has been reviewed by Klein,’ and it
is shown that both kinds erystallizing in the pyritohedral and tetrahe-
dral divisions of the isometric system are identical in composition, as
proved by analyses by Jannasch. An inaugural address by Herschenz
gives an account of the Harz barite, with a number of new forms. Dii-
sing? adds many other new planes for erystals of various localities ;
many of them seem to be vicinal planes. The inexhaustible species
epidote has been taken up anew, the Swedish mineral by Flink,® that
from the Austrian Alps by Griinzer,? and again by Zimanyi,’” and that
from Elba" by Artini. The result of these memoirs is to add a number
of new forms to the already very long list. The absorption phenomena of
epidote have been studied by Ramsay.” Becke™ continues a former line

of investigation in describing the etching figures on pyrite, sphalerite,

galena, and magnetite. Of more.general physical character may be »
mentioned the work of Hastings! on the double refraction of calcite ;
remarkable as of a higher grade of accuracy than any experiments of
the same kind before made, and which prove the law of Huyghens to
be true to less than one part in five hundred thousand. In other words,
it is coneluded that there is no known method by which an error in it,
if it is not absolutely true, can be discovered. Bickstrom? has contrib-
uted a paper on the thermo electricity of erystals. An excellent diseus-
sion of the molecular structure of crystals has been given by Groth, in
his address before the Munich Academy. A paper read by J. W. Judd?
before the Mineralogical Society of Great Britain is also an interesting
discussion of the development of a lamellar structure in quartz crystals
by mechanical means. Abstracts of a number of other papers of 1887-
’88 referring more or less closely to mineral physics are given in Groth’s
Zeitschrift, vol. XV, p. 298 et seq.

CHEMICAL MINERALOGY.

Riggs has investigated anew the composition of tourmaline,‘ and with
improved methods has made a series of analyses, twenty in all, of the
widely different varieties from typical localities. The following ratio is
established: Si: B: R': O=1: 4: 2: 5and the formula R,BO,2Si0,
where R! is the univalent equivalent of the bases with the oxygen-excess
incorporated in an Al=O group. Ifan O—H group is assumed the for-
mula is written, R,)BO,28i0,. The typical kinds are then

Lithia tourmaline....-12SiO2. 3B,0; 4H.O. 8Al,03. 2(Na,Li),0.

Magnesia tourmaline..128i02. 3B203. 4620. 5A1,03. 78Mg0.4Na.0.

Wiilfing? has made the analyses of Riggs the basis of a series of cal-
culations designed to throw light upon the composition. He concludes
that the various varieties can be regarded as isomorphous mixtures in
different proportions of the molecules

Clarke has added some analyses® to those previously published of
different kinds of mica, including amuscovite from North Carolina, and
a number of iron micas from different points. The same author has
studied the nickel ores of Oregon,’ which are similar to those of New
Caledonia in composition. He concludes that the parent mineral was
a nickel-bearing olivine. Whitfield® contributes a series of analyses of
some borates, colemanite, ulexite, ludwigite, axinite, etc., using recent im-

proved methods in determining the boron. Penfield and Sperry! have
also worked in the same line, and their analyses of howlite prove that it
is in fact a silicoborate. not a mixture as had been suggested before, and
having the composition H;Ca,B;SiO,,.

Jannasel’” has analyzed a series of heulandites from different locali-
ties and proved that they contain considerable amounts of strontium (up —
to 3.6 per cent.) which must have been overlooked by earlier analysts.
Linck? has made an examination of some iron sulphates from Chili on
both the chemical and crystallographic side, adding a new species
(quenstedtite, see beyond) and also new points about copiapite, coquim-
bite and roemerite, halotrichite and fibroferrite. The work of Frenzel
and Darapsky in the same direction is mentioned on a later page.

Eakins‘ gives descriptions and analyses of two sulphantimonites from
Colorado, one of which is a freieslebenite containing only lead; the
other has the composition 3PbS.2Sb.8;. An inaugural dissertation by
Carl Hersch is devoted to the discussion of the water in the zeolites
with numerous analyses. Another by Vogel gives a number of analy-
ses of vesuvianite from different localities, without, however, attempt-
ing to establish a new formula. Still another by Noelting discusses
the relations of the ‘‘Schalenblende” to the ordinary isometrie sphale-
rite and the hexagonal wurtzite. He finds that wurtzite is generally
present, and probably in many cases has been formed by molecular re-
arrangement from the original sphalerite.

An important series of papers by Julien? discusses at length the re-
lations of the different minerals coming under the general head of iron
pyrites, pyrite, marcasite, and pyrrhotite, especially as regards their oc-
currence together. The varying pbysical characters of pyrite, specific
gravity, color, and especially resistance to change, are found to be due
to the presence of marcasite—the less stable compound—with it in dif-
ferent proportions. This is shown to have important applications as
affecting the durability of building stones containing iron pyrites. The
alteration of pyroxene into serpentine has been minutely studied by
Merrill’ for the locality at Montville, New Jersey. The jade articles in
the Washington Museum have been studied chemically and microscop-
ically by Clarke and Merrill.7

The synthetic formation of minerals has been further studied by
some of the French chemists, who have already done such important
work in this direction. Among the various contributions in this field
are the formation of crocoite, celestite, anglesite, hydrocerussite, by
Bourgeois ; of pharmacolite, by Dufét; of zincite, franklinite, magne-
tite, tephroite, rhodonite, wollastonite, barite, celestite, anhydrite,
pyrolusite, by Gorgeu ; quartz and tridymite, by Kroustchoff; of pyro-

morphite, mimetite, campylite, by Michel; of pyrochroite, by de Schul-
ten. Papers upon the above subjects will be found in volumes Ix and
x of the Bulletin of the Krench Mineralogical Society.

A paper of especial interest on this class of topics is that of Doel-
ter! on the synthesis of the micas by fusing together various silicates
with metallic fluorides. Thus the fusion of an aluminous hornblende or
augite with sodium or magnesium fluoride yielded a magnesia mica
(meroxene); from an aluminous augite, with little iron, a mica resem-
bling phlogopite was obtained, and from glaucophane a magnesia mica
containing a considerable amount of soda. By fusing together the sili-
eate K,AI,Si,0, with potassinm or sodium fluoride in potassium fluo-
silicate, muscovite was obtained. With magnesium silicate a mica near
phlogopite was the result, and if iron silicate was also used a brown
mica near meroxene was obtained. The same potassium silicate, with
lithium silicate and potassium or sodinm fluoride, yielded a mica with
large axial angle. When pennine was fused with potassium silicate a
product resembling phlogopite was the result; a magnesium garnet un-
der like conditions, a meroxene mica low in iron. Andalusite fused
with the fluorides of potassium, of silicon, and aluminium yielded a
muscovite, and by the addition of lithia and iron, a mica near zinnwal-
dite. From vesuvianite mica was seldom obtained, the common result
being scapolite. The author also describes his results in obtaining the
ealcium silicate, wollastonite, by fusing together CaSiO; with calcium
aud sodium fluorides. There have also been recent contributions to the
same subject by Hautefeuille? and by Kroustchoft?

NEW MINERAL OCCURRENCES.

A point of much interest is the discovery of a diamond-like form of
carbon in the meteoric stone of Novo-Urei, Penza, Russia, which fell
September 22, 1886. ‘This is described by Jerofeieff and Latschinoftt.4
The meteorite was not unusual in general appearance, having a dark-
eray color and consisted chiefly of olivine, augite, and nickeliferous iron.
In the course of the analysis, however, it was found that from 2 to 25
per cent. was not attacked by acids; nearly two-thirds of this proved
to consist of amorphous carbon, and the remainder in the form of light-
gray grains was also nearly pure carbon. These grains had a specific
gravity of 3.1, and a hardness sufficient to scratch corundum, so that
the conclusion was reached that they were true diamond, perhaps in
a massive form like the carbonado. The occurrence of graphitic carbon
in isometric form in an Australian iron is mentioned under the descrip-
tion of cliftonite beyond.

color and strong pleochroism has been noted at a number of localities
since its original discovery, near Lyons; these are Brignais, depart-
ment of the Rhone, France; Wolfshau, in Silesia; near Tvedestrand, in
Norway; Harlem, New York, and Clip, Yuma County, Arizona. The
equally rare mineral bertrandite, a beryllium silicate, first found near
Nantes, has since been identified at Pisek, Bohemia, by Scharizer,! and
in Colorado with the beryl and phenacite of Mount Antero by Penfield.?
This last occurrence of phenacite deserves special note, since it
has added materially to our knowledge of the species as noted before.
Another new locality of phenacite has also been discovered in the region
of, Stoneham, Maine,’? a few miles west, just across the State line in
New Hampshire, in North Chatham.

Lavenite, a mineral recently (1885) described, from the island Laven,
on the Norwegian coast, has been identified at several widely separated
localities, thus in the elwolite syenite of Brazil, and the foyaite of West
Africa. Attention has been called by Judd‘ to the occurrence of leucite
in Australia, and G. H. Williams® shows that the rare calcium titanate
perofskite occurs in the serpentine of Syracuse, New York. Kunz de-
scribes a variety of oligoclase remarkable for its glassy transparent char-
acter; it is from Bakersville, North Carolina. It has been analyzed by
Clarke, and later Ly Penfield,’ and the latter finds further that it is ab-
normal in its optical character, giving an extinction angle on the base of
+ 40° instead of + 1. ;

The Mammoth mine, Utah, has recently afforded a series of rare copper
arseniates, most of which had not before been known from this country
These were first noted by Richard Pearce, and since have been described
by Hillebrand® on the chemical, and Washington on the physical side.
Among the species identified are olivenite, clinoclasite, pharmacosiderite,
mixite, erinite, tyrolite, chalcophyllite, brochantite, scorodite. Scorodite
is also shown by Hague’ to be a hot spring deposit in the Yellowstone
Park.

Crystals of rhodochrosite, of a beautiful pink color, and perfectly
transparent, have been obtained from the John Reed mine, Lake County,
Colorado; it is perhaps the finest occurrence of the species. The western
United States have also recently yielded fine specimens of azurite,
cuprite, malachite, vanadinite, wulfenite, from Arizona; hanksite, cole-

manite, trona, from California, and many others.

The recent aera for some of the rare chemical elements fo technical
purposes has led to the discovery that the supposed relatively rare
minerals, zircon and monazite, occur on a large scale in the rocks and
soil of North Carolina. During six months in 1887-1888, no less than 25

tons of zircons were obtained from the Green River mines, Henderson
County, North Carolina; the mining was carried on under contract
with W. E. Hidden. The same mineralogist las described! the rare
yttrium phosphate, xenotime, from a number of new localities in North
Carolina, and also from New York (Manhattan Island).

Some of the most important mineral discoveries of the past two years
are contained in the following descriptions of new species.

NEW MINERALS.

Amarantite.—See Hohmaunite.

Arseniopleite—A new manganese arseniate, belonging to a group of
minerals to which a considerable number of new species have been added
recently. It occurs in cleavable masses or nodules, often forming small
veins, with rhodonite and hausmannite, in a crystalline limestone at the
Sjé mine, Gryhyttan, Sweden. its color is reddish brown. It has been
investigated optically by, Bertrand and found to be uniaxial with nega-
tive douvle refraction, and probably is to be referred to the rhombo-
hedral system. An analysis yielded the following:

As0s Sb.0s MnO Fe0; PbO CaO MgO #20 CL
44.98 trace 28.29 3.68 4.48 Stl | ccpall, 4.54 trace = 97.14.

Deducting impurities and correcting it according to the state of oxi-
dation of the manganese it becomes Mn, O; 7.80, MnO 21.25, (Described
by L. J. Igelstrém in Bull Soe. Min., 1888, vol. x1, 39.)

Auerlite—A new thorium mineral of peculiar interest because it seems
to occupy an intermediate position between the silicates and phos-
phates. It was discovered by W. ®. Hidden, in Henderson County,
North Carolina, occurring in disintegrated granitic rocks associated with *
zircon and implanted upon it in parallel position. It is found in pris-
matic tetragonal crystals like zircon in form and angle. It has a pale
yellow to orange or deep red color. The hardness is 2.5 to 3, and the
specific gravity 4.42 to 4.77, the orange-red crystals having the higher
density. The luster is wax like and it is brittle and easily crumbled.
An analysis by J. B. Mackintosh gave the following results:

Si02 POs ThO» FeO; CaQ MgO AlOsete. H20,COz

7.64 7.46 70.13 1.38 0.49 0.29 1.10 1121 99-70
The water and carbon dioxide are present in about the ratio of 10: 1.
Assuming the homogeneity of the material, which its appearance seemed
to jastify, the mineral is a hydrous silicate and phosphate of thorium.
It will be remembered that the cerium phosphate, monazite, uniformly
coutains more or less thorium silicate about which there has been some
difference of opinion as to whether it iS an impurity or not; this new
mineral throws light upon the question. It is named after Dr. Carl
Auer von Welsbach. (Described by Hidden and Mackintosh in Amer.
Journ, Sci., 1888, xx xvi, 461.)

Awaruite—A kind of nickeliferous native iron found in the drift of
the Gorge River, which empties into the Awarua, or Big Bay, on the west
coast of the middle island of New Zealand. It is believed to have been
derived from a peridotite, now altered largely into serpentine, and is
associated with gold, platinum, cassiterite, chromite, magnetite. Its
hardness is about 5, aud the specific gravity 8.1. The composition is
expressed by the formula FeNi,, as shown by an analysis by W. Skey,
viz:

Ni Fe Co S Si02
67.63 31.02 0.70 0.22 0.43 = 100
This terrestrial nickeliferous iron is closely allied to the similar me-
teoric mineral which has been called octibbehite, found in Oktibbeha,
County, Mississippi. (Described by G. H. F. Ulrich in Amer. Journ.
Sci., 1887, xx x1, 244.)

Barkevikite, etc—In a preliminary account of the results of an ex-
tended study of the minerals of the augite-syenite and elzolite-syenite
veins of Southern Norway, W.C. Brégger has given brief accounts of
a number of new species. Full descriptions are promised later. The
names of these are, barkevikite, calciothorite, melanocerite, nordenskidldine,
rosenbuschite. They are characterized brietiy as follows:

Barkevikite is a mineral belonging to the amphibole group, and most
closely related to arfvedsonite; it is distinct, however, in optical char-
acters.

Calciothorite is a hydrous silicate of thorium and calcium, and it is
inferred, as seems very probable, that it is an alteration product of an
original thorium silicate (ThO,SiO,) isomorphous with zircon. Thorite,
orangite, eucrasite, freyalite, are other hydrous silicates that probably
have had a similar origin.

Melanoceriie is a complex silicate of the cerium metals, yttrium and
calcium, with other substances in small amounts, including 3 per cent.
boron trioxide. It oceurs in dark-brown erystals, belonging to the
rhombohedral system, and tabular in habit.

Nordenskidldine, named after the Swedish mineralogist and explorer,
A.E. Nordenskidld, is a mineral of remarkable composition, viz, a borate
of tin and calcium, CaO.SnO,.B,0;. It has a sulphur-yellow color ; its
hardness is 5.5 to 6, and its specific gravity 4.20. It appears in tabular
rhombohedral erystals,

Rosenbuschite, named after Professor Rosenbusch, of Heidelberg, is a
silicate of caleium and sodium with zirconium, titavium, and lanthanum
in small amount. It belongs to the monoclinic system and its erystals
are near wollastenite and pectolite in angle, and it is accordingly ealled
azirconium-pectolite. The color is orange-gray; the hardness 1s 5 to 6,
and the specific gravity 3.30.

This account is given in the Geol. Férening Férhandlingar (Stock-
holm), 1887, vol. 1x, 247, and an abstract is given in Groth’s Zeit-

schrift, 1888, vol. xv, 103. In the latter place hiortdahlite is men-
tioned as another new mineral from the same region but not described.

Barysil.—A_ new lead silicate from the Harstig mine, Pajsberg, Swe-
den. Itis referred to the hexagonal system, has basal cleavage, white
color, hardness equal to 3, and a specific gravity of 6.11 to 6.55, An
analysis afforded :

Side PbO MnO FeO CaO MgO Ton.

16.98 77.84 3.49 0.16 0.41 0.58 0.66=100.12
The formula is accordingly 5PbO. 28i0,. It occurs in iron ore with eal-
cite, yellow garnet, tephroite, and galena. The name has reference to
its high specific gravity. (Described by A. Sjégren and Lundstrom in
the Gfversigt Vet. Akad. Forhandlingar, 1883, XLV, 7.)

Belonesite.—The study of a mass of ancient volcanic rock enveloped
in the Vesuvian lava of 1872 has led to the discovery of two species to
which Seacchi has given the names belonesite (belonesia) and eri-
phiolite (crifiolite). Belonesite, as the name suggests, occurs in needle-
like crystals. These are white and transparent, and are referred to the
tetragonal system. The material was insufficient for an analysis, but
qualitative tests led to the conclusion that itis a molybdate of magne-
sium.

Criphiolite occurs in small tabular crystals belonging to the mono-
clinic system. They are covered by apatite so as to be concealed by
it, whence the name given to the species. The color is honey-yellow;
the specific gravity 2.674. An analysis gave: P.O; 48.91, MgO 33.58,
CaO 14.60. Loss 2.91=100. The examination showed that fluorine
was probably present, and the amount is estimated as nearly equal to
7 per cent. The mineral is hence near wagnerite in composition.
(Described by A. Scacchi in Mem. Accad. Napoli, 1887, vol. 1, No. 5.)

Bementite.—A new manganese silicate from the prolific locality at
Franklin Furnace, New Jersey. It occurs in stellate aggregations,
having a foliated structure and in aspect closely resembling some pyro-
phyllite. The color is a pale grayish-yellow; it is soft and friable; the
specific gravity is 2.981. An analysis yielded :

SiO, MnO FeO ZO MgO #20

39.00) 4202. ayode 2266) foes | ea 00
This yields the formula 2(H,,Mn)O,SiO,. Itis found that the water goes
off atatemperature above 200°. Bementiteis named after Mr. Clarence
S. Bement, of Philadelphia, by G. A. Koenig. (Proceedings Acad. Nat.
Sci., Philadelphia, 1887, p. 311.)

Beryllonite.—A new beryllium phosphate from Stoneham, Maine. A
preliminary description announces that it occurs in colorless crystals
and cleavage fragments. The erystals are highly modified, and belong
to the orthorhombic system, with a prismatic angle of about 120°. The
hardness is 5.5; the specific gravity 2. A qualitative analysis by H. L.
Wells shows it to be an anhydrous phosphate of beryllium and sodium.
MINERALOGY. 467

The same region has afforded a number of rare minerals, including the
beryllium phosphate, herderite, and the beryllium silicate, phenacite.
(Described by E. 8S. Danain Amer. Journ. Sci., 1888, vol. XXXVI, p. 290).

Biickingite—Announced by G. Linck as a new iron sulphate from
Tierra Amarilla, near Copiapo, Chili. A further study has proved it to
be identical with roemerite, and in a later paper he describes it under
this name. The material has allowed of amore perfect crystallographic
and chemical investigation than has hitherto been possible. (Jahrb.
fiir Min., Vol. 1, 213, 1888; Zeitschr. fiir Kryst., 1888, vol. xv, p. 22).

Calciothorite.—See Barkevikite.

Calciostrontianite—A name given by Cathrein to a calcium-bearing
strontianite from Brixlegg, Tyroi, and corresponding to the mineral
“from Massachusetts” called by Thomson in 1836 emmonite, after Prof.
E. Emmons.

Cliftonite—A form of graphitic carbon found in the meteoric iron of
Youndegin, West Australia (discovered 1884). It occurs in minute
cubic crystals imbedded in the iron, and separated by dissolving the
iron in acid. The average thickness of the iarger erystals is one-
hundredth of aninch. The cubic planes predominate, but dodecahedral
faces were also noted. They are black in color; the hardness is 2.5,
and the specific gravity 2.12. They were proved chemically to be pure
carbon, and they resemble graphite in most of the characters except
form and greater hardness. These observations are of interest in view
of the recent discovery of carbon, having the hardness of the diamond
in a meteoric stone (noted above), and also the earlier observations of
Haidinger on isometric crystals of carbon, supposed to be pseudomorph
after pyrite in the Arva iron. Cliftonite is named after Prof. R. B. Clif-
ton, of Oxford, by L. Fletcher, in the Mineralogical Magazine, 1887,
vol. Vil, p. 121.

Cristobalite—A form of silica in minute octahedal erystals found at
the tridymite locality of Cerro San Cristobal, near Pachuca, Mexico.
They are associated with tridymite in cavities in andesite. It is not
certain whether they represent an allotropic form of silica, or as seems
more probable a pseudomorph after some mineral in isometric octahe.-
drons. A cubic form of silica (melanophlogite) was found by Lasaulx on
the sulphur of Girgenti. Cristobalite is described by G. vom Rath in
the Jahrb. Min., 1887, vol. 1, 198.

Dahllite.—A mineral of remarkable composition, since it contains both
calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate; it is in fact the first case in
which a phosphate and carbonate occur in the same species. The nat-
ural suggestion that the carbonate is present as impurity only, in the
form of calcite, is regarded by the describers as inapplicable, since their
microscopic examination convinced them of its homogeneity: Dahilite
occurs as a rather thin crust, having a rounded lustrous surface and a
fibrous structure, the fibers being perpendicular to the underlying base
of massive reddish apatite. In color itis pale yellowish white or reddish

yellow; it is translucent and resembles chalcedony. It is optically,
uniaxial and negative. The hardness is about 5 and the specific gravity
3.053. An analysis yielded the following results:

This leads to the formula 4 Ca; P.O, + 2 Ca CO; + H,O. The locality
where it has been found, though only very sparingly, is the apatite re-
gion in the parish of Bamle, Norway. Named after ——— by W.C.
Brogger and Backstrém in the Cifversigt Vet.-Akad. Forhandlingar,
Stockholn, 1887, p. 493.

Dihydro-thenardite.—A sodium sulphate, allied to thenardite, but, as
the name suggests, containing two molecules of water. It crystallizes
in the monoclinic system. It forms a thin bed on the shores of Lake
Gori, Tiflis, Russia. (Described by Markovnikoff in Journ. Russ. Phys.
Chem., and an abstract in the Berichte deutsch. Chem. Ges. Berlin,
1887, p. 546).

Edisonite.—A rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide and (if dis-
tinct from rutile) the fourth form in which this oxide is kuown to occur in
nature. The original specimen was found in 1879 by W. KE. Hidden at
the Whistnant gold mine, Polk County, North Carolina, in the concen-
trations of placer washings. It was associated with zircon, xenotime,
rutile, monazite, and a number of other species. It has a bronze-yellow
or golden-brown color, a resinous to adamantine luster and a yellowish
white streak. The hardness is about 6 and the specific gravity 4.26 to
4.28. The symmetry of the form is that of an orthorhombic crystal and
the crystallographic study by Des Cloizeaux (Bull. Soc. Min., 1886,
vol, 1x) shows that it does not vary very widely from the tetragonal type,
and in angle bears a certain relation to rutile; he calls it, in fact, a
dimorphous form of rutile. A qualitative examination by Damour
showed it to be essentially TiO, in composition and a more thorough
analysis by Penfield, undertaken later, has confirmed this and proved
the absence of all other substances except a trace of iron. Named after
Mr. Thomas A. Edison, by W. E. Hidden, in Amer. Journ. Sci., Oc-
tober, 1838, vol. XXXVI, p. 272.

Hudidymite.—A new silicate of sodium and berylium from the island
Obere Aréin the Langesundfjord, Norway. In his preliminary account
Brégger describes it as occurring in tabular monoclinic crystals having
the axial ratio a: b: e=1.7107: 1: 1.1071, G=86° 143’. The crystals are
twins with the basal planes as twinning plane, which is also the diree-
tion of cleavage. The color is white and the luster vitreous or pearly.
The hardness is 6 and the specific gravity 2.553. The optic axes lie in
the plane of symmetry and the aente positive bisectrix makes an angle
of 58° 30’ with the vertical axis in the acute angle of #. The first an-
alysis by Flink made the mineral contain aluminium instead of beryllium.
This was corrected by Nordenskiéld, whose analysis gave

SiOz BeO Na20 HeO
Could 10.62 12.24 31999765
MINERALOGY. 469

The formula is consequently H,O, Na,O, BeO, 3Si0,2, or HNa Be Si,O,.
It is associated with analcite, natrolite, and apophyllite. (Brégger in
Nyt Mag. f. Vid., vol. xxx1, 196, 187; Nordenskiéld in Geol. Férening.
Forhandl. 1887, vol. 1x, 434.)

Facellite or Phacellite—Described by E. Scacchi (Rend. Acead. Na-
poli, December, 1888) as a new mineral from Monte Somma; it is, how-
ever, evidently identical with the mineral from the same locality
ealled by Mierisch kaliophilite (Tschermak’s Mineral. petrograph.
Mittheilungen, vol. v111, p. 160). It occurs in acicular crystals which
are optically uniaxial, and probably belong to the hexagonal system.
They are colorless, have a hardness of 6, and a specific gravity of
2.493. An analysis yielded :

Si02 ALO;  K20 NO

37.73 33.09 29.30 0.37 = 1.0.49.
This agrees closely with the formula KAISiO, or K,0, Al,O;, 2S8iO,,
which is that given to kaliophilite. It falls into the same group with
nephelite which has an analogous formula, and also the lithium silicate
eucryptite.

Griqualandite.-—A name given by G. Grant Hepburn to a variety of
the silivified crocidolite from South Africa; well known under the name
of tiger-eye. He regards it as a silicate of iron, but it is obviously not
a distinct mineral but an indefinite mixture of silica and hydrated iron
sesquioxide. (Chemical News, May, 27, 1887.)

Fiedlerite.—See Laurionite.

Heiiophyllite—A new chloro-arsenate of lead occurring with rhodo-
tilite (see below) at Pajsberg, Sweden. It has a pale sulphur-yellow
color, and a foliated structure showing one distinct cleavage yielding
thin plates. These show an acute bisectrix in the polariscope with sym-
metrical axial figure, from which it is safely concluded that it belongs
to the orthorhombic system. The hardness is 2, the specific gravity
6.886; on the cleavage surface the luster is adamantine, elsewhere
vitreous. An analysis yielded:

As0; PbO Mn0,FeO Cl

11.69 80.70 0.54 8.00—100.3; deduct O 1.80—99. 13.
This corresponds to the formula Pb,As,O; + 2PbCl., which requires
As,0512.03, PbO 81.28, Cl 8.63=101.94 (deduct 1.94100). This min-
eral has essentially the composition of Nordenskidld’s ecdemite from
Langban, but differs in form and is probably identical with a mineral
noted as occurring with ecdemite and at that time referred to the
orthorhombic system. (Described by G. Flink in Gifversigt Vet. Akad.
Forhandl. Stockholm, 1888, p 574.)

Hiortdahlite.—See Barkevikite.

Hohmannite.—In_ specimens of copiapite from Caracoles, Bolivia,
Frenzel has identified a new iron sulphate, and perhaps two new species.
The mineral, named hohmannite after the discoverer, occurs in brown-
ish red fibrous aggregates having the optical characters of a triclinie
A470 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

species. The hardness is 5, and the specific gravity 2.24. Associated
with it is the other iron sulphate called amarantite, which 1s in aggre-
gates of minute prismatic crystals. These are orange-red in color, and
in cleavage and optical characters they approach hohmannite. They
are, however, less readily attacked by water. The composition of the
two minerals is the same, viz: Fe,0;2S0,+7H,0, the analyses being as
follows:
SO; FeO; HO
Hohmannite: 33.84 35.58 30.00 —99.50
Amarantite: 35.58 37.26 27.62 = 100.46

An earlier analysis of hohmannite gave somewhat different results but
was made on less pure material. There is little doubt, therefore, that
both minerals are to be united under the above name. (Min. petr. Mitth.,
1887, vol. 1x, 397, 428.)

Horsfordite—A new copper antimonide, analogous to the copper
arsenide, algodonite, and the silver antimonide, dyscrasite. Itis amas-
sive mineral, resembling native silver in color, with a high luster on a
fresh surface but soon tarnishing. The hardness is 4 to 5, and the
specific gravity 8.812. The mean of three analyses gave:

Sb Cu

26.86 73.37 = 100.23.
The formula lies between Cu;Sb and Cu,Sb, the analytical results
agreeing very closely with Cu, Sbo. It forms an extensive deposit
near Mytilene in Asia Minor. It is named after Professor Horsford by
A. Laist and T. H. Norton in Amer. Chem. Journ., vol. x, p. 60, 188-.

Inesite—A hydrated silicate of manganese and calcium, probably
the same mineral as that called rhodotilite by Flink (see below). It
occurs in fibrous radiated forms, of a flesh-red color, in the Dillinburg
region, Germany. Hardness, 6 to 7; specific gravity, 3.103. An anal-
ysis gave:

SiO, MnO Cad FeO MgO ‘NO; ESO
43.92 38.23 8.00 0.69 0.28 0.29 8.49— 99.90,

Described by A. Schneider in Zeitschr. deutsch. geolog. Ges., 1888,
vol. XXXIx, p. 829.

Ignatieffite—A name given by K. K. Flug to a variety of aluminite
from Bachmut in southern Russia. It occurs in considerable quantity
in reniform concretionary forms and though impure may have technical
value. (Verh. Russ. Min. Ges., St. Petersburg, vol. XXIIt, p. 116.)

Ldangbanite.—A mineral of unusual composition, a silico-antimonate of
manganeseand iron. It occurs in hexagonal prismatic crystals, often
complex in form and resembling apatite. It has an iron-black color,
a metallic luster and conchoidal fracture. The hardness is 6.5, the
specific gravity 4.918. An analysis yielded :

Sbe05 SiO, MnO FeO
15.42 10.88 64,00 10.32 = 100.62.
MINERALOGY. 471

The author regards this as corresponding to @ manganese silicate (Mn;
SiO;) and antimonate of iron (Fe,;Sb.0,) in about the ratio of 4:1.
Langbanite is found at Langban, Sweden, in granular limestone with
schefferite, magnetite, and rhodonite. (Described by G. Flink, in the
Zeitschrift f. Kryst., 1887, vol. Xx1u, p. 1.)

Lansfordite—A white translucent mineral having a erystalline stract-
ure and vitreous luster. The hardness is 2.5, the specifie gravity 1.54
to 1.69. An analysis by Keeley gave:

CO2z MgO H20

18.90 23.18 57.79 =99.87.
Of the very large amount of water contained 26.3 per cent.were lost over
sulphuric acid at the end of aweek. The formula deduced is 3MgCOs;,
Mg(VUH),.+21H,0. It occurs asa stalactitic growth in the anthracite
coal mine of Lansford, near Tamaqua, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.
(Described by F. A. Genth in Zeitschr. f. Kryst., vol. Xtv, p. 255.)

Laubanite—A new zeolitic mineral resembling stilbite from the
basalt, near Lauban, Silesia. It occurs in fine fibrous radiated snow-
white aggregates, sometimes spherical in form. The hardness is 4.5
to 5; the specific gravity 2.23. An analysis gave:

SiO, AlO3 FeO Cad MgO H20

47.84 16.74 0. 56 163s 1.35 17, 08=99. 76.
This corresponds to 2CaSiO;, Al,(SiO,);,6H,0, which brings it near
to laumontite. (Described by H. Traube in Jahrb. Min., 1887, vol.
Il, 64.)

Laurionite.—A. mineral of comparatively recent origin, having been
formed as the result of the action of sea-water upon the ancient lead
slags at Laurion, Greece, where there were lead and zinc mines worked
by the Greeks before the Christian era. Laurionite occurs in white
prismatic crystals related to mendipite in form, and has a hardness of
3.5. An analysis by Bodewig gave:

Pb O Cl HO
79. 38 Sag 13.77 3. 68 = 100.
This gives the formula Pb(OH),, PbCl.

Associated with the laurionite is another mineral in tabular mono-
clinic crystals and having the same qualitative composition. I[t is in-
ferred to be also an oxy-chloride of lead and has been named Fiedlerite
after Baron Fiedler. (Described by G. vom Rath in Sitzungsber. Nied.
Ges. Bonn., June 6, 1887.)

Mangano-tantalite—A member of the tantalite-columbite group of
minerals from the gold washings in the Ural. It has the form and
habit of common columbite, but the specific gravity is 7.37, and the
color, though nearly black, is orange-red in thin splinters. The follow-
ing analysis by Blomstrand shows it to be pure tantalate of manganese:

Ta.0; NboOs Sn0Ox,WO; MnO FeO CaO ign.
79, 81 4,47 0, 67 13. 88 1 on Wy 0.17 (0. 17] = 100, 33.
472 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

This mineral is of interest because if shows that the same form belongs
alike to the tantalate and niobate of iron and manganese, although the
mineral ordinarily called tantalate does not conform to this very closely.
(Described by A. Arzruni in Verh. Russ. Min. Ges., St. Petersburg,
vol. xxii, 181.)

Martinite—A pseudomorphous mineral having the form of gypsum,
but consisting chiefly of calcium phosphate ; it is from the guano of the
Island of Curacoa, It appears in aggregates of minute rhombohedrons,
white or yellowish in color. The specific gravity is 2.894. An analysis
gave:

P20; CaO H20 Organic Tusol.

AT267\) AGNT8 42 52 0:75 0.20 = 99. 92.
For this the formula is 2Ca,(PO,),, 4 CaHPO,+H,O. (Described by
J. H. Kloos in Samm]. Mus. Leiden, ser. 2, vol. 1; abstract in Jahrb.
Min., 1888, vol. 1, 41 ref.)

Mazapilite.—Stated on the basis of a preliminary examination to be
an arsenite of calcium and iron. It occurs in deep red to black crystals,
having a hardness of 7, and a specific gravity of 3.567. It is from the
mining district of Mazapil, Zacatecas, Mexico. (G. A. Koenig in Pro-
ceed. Acad. Nat. Sci., Philadelphia, July 3, 1888.)

Melanocerite.—See Barkevikite.

Metalonchidite.—A varity of mareasite from the St. Bernhard mine,
near Hausach, Baden. It is peculiar in containing 2.7 per cent. of
arsenic, with some nickel and lead, and hence approaches Breithaupt’s
lonchidite. (Described by F. Sandberger in Oesterreich. Zeitschr. Berg.
Hatt, 13887, Vols XXX.)

Metastibnite.—A form of antimony sulphide, like stibnite in composi-
tion, but of a bright red color, like the corresponding compound obtained
in the laboratory. It occurs sparingly as an amorphous red deposit at
Steamboat Springs, California. (Described by G. F. Becker in Mono-
graph x11, U. 8. Geological Survey.)

Nordenskioldine.— See Barkevikite.

Paposite—A hydrous iron sulphate from the Union mine near Pa-
posa, Atacama. It occurs in dark red crystalline masses, having “a
fibrous radiated structure. The formula obtained by Darapsky is
2Fe,0;, 350;+10H,0, so that it approaches closely to fibroferrite,
(Bol. Soc. Min. Santiago, No. 92, October; 1887, in Jahrb. Min., 1889,
vol. I, 23 ref.)

Pscudobiotite—An alteration product of the biotite from the erystal-
lized limestone of the Kaiserstuhl. The mean of two analyses gave:

Si02 TiO, ALO: FeO; Mm0, MgO K,0 1.0

It is not to be regarded as a definite compound. (Described by A.
Knop in Zeitschr. f. Kryst., 1887, vol. x11, 607.)
Rhodotilite.—A mineral occurring with heliophyllite (see above) at the
MINERALOGY. 473

Harstig mine, Pajsberg, Sweden. It oceurs in massive forms, having a
columnar or fibrous structure, and shows two unequal cleavages inclined
at an angle of 825 degrees. On the basis of an optical examination it
is referred to the triclinic system. The color is rose-red and the luster
silky. The hardness is 4 to 5, and the specific gravity 3.05. An an-
alysis yielded:

SiOz MnO FeO CaO MgO PbO #20

43. 67 37. 04 1.11 8.38 0.15 0.77 717 =995 29:
This gives as the formula 2 (MnCa).SiO;+ H.O, which brings it in com-
position near the hydrorhodonite of Igelstré6m which is MnSiO;+ H,O.
In form and appearance it bears some resemblance to wollastonite and
pectolite. It is the most recently formed of the minerals of the Harstig
mine, filling cavities between calcite crystals. (Described by G. Flink,
in Cfversigt Vet. Akad. Foérhandl., Stockholm, 1888, p. 571.) See
Tnesite, above.

Riebeckite—A mineral belonging to the amphibole group, from the
island of Socotra, where it was collected by Dr. E. Riebeck, after whom
jtisnamed. It appears in slender prismatic crystals, having the char-
acteristic cleavage imbedded in granite. The color is black. An analy-
sis, after deducting 7.12 per cent. zircon, yielded :

SiO, FeO; FeO MnO CaO MgO Na,O KO

DOO 28306 98ers OlOds ese /OIS4 8.79 072 = 99.98.

It is thus like the pyroxene egirite, essentially a silicate of iron sesqui-
oxide and soda, and is regarded as occupying the same place among the
amphiboles. The mineral arfvedsonite has occupied this position, but
recent analyses have made it contain chiefly iron protoxide, and if these
are sustained, riebeckite cannot be united with it. (Described by A.
Sauer in Zeitschr. deutsch. Geol. Ges., 1888, vol. XL, 158.)

Rosenbuschite.—See Barkevikite.

Sulphohalite.—A mineral consisting of the sulphate and chloride of
sodium. It was discovered by W. E. Hidden on the hanksite of Borax
Lake, San Bernardino County, California, and thus far is extremely
rare. It appears in rhombic dodecahedrous, which are transparent and
of a faint greenish-yellow collor. The hardness is 3.5, and the specific
gravity 2.489. An analysis by J. B. Mackintosh yielded:

SO. Cl Na,COs
42.48 IF
or calculating the chlorine and sulphur as combined with sodium only:

Na,SO: NaCl Na2CO;

7.4) 21,62) +) k77=98.80:
This corresponds to 3Na,SO, 2NaCl. The name sulphohalite is given in
allusion to the unusual composition of the mineral. (Described by W.
BE. Hidden and J. B. Mackintosh in Amer. Journ. Sci., 1888, vol XXXVI,
p. 463.)
BOTANY FOR 1887 AND 1888.

By F. H. KNow ron, M. 8., Assistant Curator in the National Museum.

The years 1887, 1888 have witnessed the publication of a very large
amount of material, considerably in excess of that of many former
years, without there being published anything of special moment. The
results that have been presented may be regarded simply as a contin-
uation of the various lines of investigation that have occupied attention
during later years. Since the field of systematic botany has been so
thoroughly worked up, more and more attention has been shown to the
investigation of problems of histology, physiology, and embryology.
Notwithstanding the many avenues open for the publication cf material
of this character, several new periodicals have been inaugurated: Mal-
phigia, The Annals of Botany, Pittonia, Garden and Forest, ete. The
coustantly increasing attention that has been given of late years to the
study of Bacteria has resulted in the production of such a mass of ma-
terial that it can no longer be considered under the head of botany,
and must be relegated to the special journals and works devoted to the
subject.

The compiler desires to make special acknowledgment for valuable
assistance to the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society, in which
Prof. A. W. Bennett has given so complete a digest of current botanical
literature.

VEGETABLE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.

The structure of the vegetable cell-wall has been much investigated
of late years, and many of the mooted questions had seemingly been
set at rest, but the latest observations may possibly render some of them
doubtful. Elliott (Trans. Bot. Soc. Edinb. xvi) has given an interesting
résumé of recent researches in this direction. Beginning with the pre-
sentation of the theory of growth by opposition as defined by Prings-
heim, and the theory of intussusception as presented by Nigeli, von
Mohl, and others, he traces the growth of ideas as modified by the
researches of Schmitz, Strasburger, Wiesner, Klebs, Schneck, and
others, and concludes that the present state of our knowledge warrants
the following conclusions: (1) Growth of the cell-wall may be affected
by deposition from the protoplasm of the cell; (2) the cell-wall, however,
always contains, during the life of the cell, living protoplasm, which is

A475
476 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

united to the eell-protoplasm ; (3) this intramural protoplasm appears
in some cases capable of growth on its own account; (4) possibly the
cell-wall is formed in the same way as the starch grain. Pechi (Atti
Soe. Tose. Sci. Nat., vit) has very recently studied the thickening of
cell-walls in the leaf-stalk of Aralia. During the early stage of growth
the thickening takes place mainly in the angles, but later distinct lay-
ers of cellulose are formed within each cell, which soon becomes ligni-
fied. From this the author concludes that in the earlier stages the
thickening is mainly by intussusception, and during the later stages
probably by opposition. On the other hand, Noll (Abbandl. Sencken-
burg Naturf. Gesell. xv) concludes, from an experimental application
of staining reagents, that growth takes place chiefly by opposition, and
the part played by intussusception is unproved. Krabbe has also
studied the structure and growth of the cell-wall (Pringsheim’s Jahrb.
f. Wiss. Bot., xvi). He investigated especially the process of increase
in thickness in the walls of the bast cells of the Apocynacew and As-
clepiadacew, and found them to be composed of lamellae, which are
themselves made up of lamelle. These lamellae apparently arise by
fresh formations from the protoplasm. Intussusception he regards as
playing only a subordinate part, and must be confined to the innermost
Jamelle. Zimmermann has an exhaustive treatise, ‘‘ Die Morphol. u.
Physiol. d Pflanzenzelle,” which forms the third volume of Schenck’s
‘Handbuch der Botanik.” It treats very fully of the structure and
chemical composition, as well as the physiology of the cell.

The morphological and chemical composition of protoplasm has been
treated of at great length by Schwarz (Beitr. z. Biol. d. Pflanzen, B.
v). He has given many details of the action of various reagents upon
protoplasm and its various modifications, only a few of which may be
here enumerated. The varying acid or alkaline reaction of cell-sap he
attributes to the substances in solution in it, such as pigments. The
protoplasm he has found to be always alkaline in reaction, as also is the
cytoplasm, nucleus, chromatophores, and in some eases the protein-
grains. The chlorophy] the author regards as having a fibrillar struct-
ure composed of what he ealls chloroplastin. The nucleus is composed
of several substances, among which he recognizes chromatin, pyrenin,
linin, and paralinin. The cytoplasm is made up of three substances: (1)
the cell-sap, (2) the microsomes, insoluble in water and the cytoplasm ;
(5) the cytoplastids. All the nuclear substances, with the exception
of chromoplastin and cytoplastin, are soluble in concentrated potash-
lye, or a10 per cent. solution of sodium chloride.

‘The influence of light upon protoplasmic movement,” in Journ. Linn.
Soe. Lond., xxiv, is the title of a long paper by Moore. The well-
known circumstance of the chlorophyll grains becoming collected into
masses in sunlight and being more or less dispersed in darkness has
been very fully re-investigated, and the conclusion reached is that these
displacements are more the result of illumination than heat. Frank
BOTANY. ATT

applied the term epistrophe to the distribution of the grains upon the
free walls of the cells, and apostrophe to the arrangement on the side
walls. Apostrophe produced by strong illumination Moore proposed
to call positive and that produced by weak illumination, negative. He
coins the word phytolysis for the whole of these phenomena. He also re-
investigated the question as to whether the grains are drawn along pas-
sively with the streaming plasma, or whether they possess the power
of independent motion. He finally adopts the conclusions of Sachs,
Pfeffer, and others, that they are drawn along passively.

The nucleus has been the subject of numerous experiments and stud-
ies. Thus Zacharias (Bot. Zeit. xLy.) has investigated its structure
and concludes that the cell-nucleus of both plants and animals is com-
posed of two distinct substances, which he calls plastin and nuclin, which
remain undissolved after treatment with artificial gastric juice. The
nuclin forms the colorable filament loups of the nucleus that remain
after treatment with artificial gastric juice or hydrochloric acid, sharply
defined and shining in appearance. It also readily absorbs certain pig-
ments, especially methyl-green. Plastin, on the other hand, is anessential
constituent of the entire protoplasmic cell-contents, and differs from
nuclin in its action under reagents. The prevalent theory that the vital
properties of the cell are derived from the nucleus has been confirmed
by Klebs (Biol. Centralbl.), who plasmolysed living cells of Zygnemia
with a solution of sugar. The effect of the plasmolysis was to cause
the cell-contents to contract and separate into two halves, each contain-
ing one of the two chlorophyll bodies, while the whole of the nucleus
was contained in one of the halves. The half cell containing the nucleus
soon regained its activity and surrounded itself with a new cell-wall.
The half-cells destitute of nucleus, while they retained their vitality
for a considerable time and even produced an abundance of starch, never
started to grow, and could not secrete a new eell-wall. Zacharias has
still more recently studied the part taken by the nucleus in cell-division
(Ber. deutsch. Bot. Gesell. v.). He confirms the earlier observations
that the cell protoplasm does not penetrate into the nucleus during its
division. Haberland (op. cit.), has studied the position of the nucleus
in mature cells and reaches the conclusion that their position is not ar-
bitrary, but depends on its function as the bearer of the idioplasm which
governs development. The young condition of the vacuoles has been
investigated by Went (Arch. Néerland, xxt.). He finds, contrary to
the general opinion, that minute vacuoles are present in the youngest
cells, for example, in the growing point. He also found vacuoles in
odspheres, pollen-grains, and cambium-cells. Halsted has recorded
(Bot. Gaz. x11.) the finding of three nuclei in pollen-grains of Sambucus
racemosa. ;

Chlorophyll has also been made the subject of recent investigation.
Tschirch has given (Ber. deutsch. Bot. Gesell., v) a résumé of recent
studies on the composition of chlorophyll, and coneludes that iron is
478 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 18838.

not a necessary constituent. He gives C.,HyN,0, as the formula for
phylloeyanic acid. Schuneck has also studied the chemistry of chloro-
phyle (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond., xLit). Hansen states (Arbeit. Inst.,
Wiirzburg, t1) that the orange-red pigment reported to have been
observed in leaves is only an aggregation of the yellow chlorophyll
pigment, which has an orange tint when presentin dense masses. Epi-
dermal chlorophyll has been further studied by Moore (Journ. Bot.,
Xxv) and the preparation of pure chlorophyll described by Macchiati
(Malpighia, 1), Peyron (Compt. Rend., cv), has devised an instrument
with which he has investigated the hourly variation in the action of
chlorophyll, finding that the funetion at different hours in the day is
proportional to the intensity of light.

Numerous other cell-contents have been studied. Hillhouse (Midl.
Nat., X and x1) has investigated the function of tannin, and finds that
it is not used in the processof growth after its production, and it can
not therefore be regarded as a food material. Fribosin is described by
Zopf (Ber. deutsch. Bot. Gesell., v) as a new cell-content, found in the
conidia of Podosphera, Spheerotheca and Erysiphe. The formation of
oxalate of lime in leaves has been investigated by Schimper (Bot. Zeit.,
XLVI), and the formation of calcium oxalate by Wakker (see Bot. Cen-
tralbl., xxxtv), In regard to the acid secretion from the roots of plants
Molisch states (Sitzb. K. K. Zool. Bot. Gesell., Wien, XxxvIt), that it
attacks organic substances even more powerfully than inorganic, and
not only dissolves them but induces otherimportant chemical changes.

The use of histological elements as a means of classification has been
further investigated during the year, and while no comprehensive dic-
tum can yet be laid down, substantial progress has been made, aid the
prospect is that when all plants have been thoroughly investigated
distinctive characters will be detected. Hildebrandt, for example, has
examipved a large number of species of Ambrosiec and Senecionidee
(Beitr. Z. vergleich. Anat. der Ambros. u. Senec. Inang. Diss.) and con-
cludes that they may be very clearly distinguished by the histological
elements. Jiiunicke (Bot. Centralbl., xxx1) also concludes that the three
genera of the Geraniacee examined by him can be distinguished from one
another by characters derived from the structure and distribution of the
vascular bundles in the leaf and flower-stalks. Juel (Bot. Centralbl.,
XXXIII) has studied the anatomical structure of the Marcegraviacee, and
Solereder (see Bot. Centralbl., Xxx1It) has discussed “The systematic
value of the perforation in the walls of vessels,” and Wible has a paper
“Zur Diagnostic des coniferen Holzer.” On the other hand, Plitt (Beitr.
z. Vergleich. Anat. d. Blattstieles d. Dikotyledonen) has examined the
petiole or leaf-stalk of two hundred and eighty-three plants in thirty
natural orders for characters of systematic value and the results were
mainly negative, and Saupe (Flora, Lxx) has investigated the wood of
Leguminosee, and finds that the division into the sub-orders Papilion-
ace Cesalpiniee and Mimosee does not correspond to structural difter-
BOTANY. A7T9

ences in the wood. He finds, however, that the species of most of the
tribes, such as Genistee, Dalbergiew, etc., do exhibit common char-
acters, and in a few genera, e. g., Cassia, Cercis, Podalyria, Sophora, the
species may be distinguished by histological characters. The structure
of the Chenopodiacee has been worked out in an elaborate manner by
Professor St. Gheroghieff (Bot. Centralbl., Xxx and xxx), and he finds
that many species may be distinguished by the histological elements of
stem or roots.

The further contributions to this same general subject have been
unusually numerous. A few only may be mentioned by title: Daguil-
lon, “Structure of the Leaves of Certain Conifer” (Bull. See. Bot. France,
XXxv); Flot, ‘* Aerial Stems” (l. c.); Baillon, “Ovules of Plantago”
(Bull. Mens. Soc. Linn., Paris, 1887); Penzig, “Anatomy and Diseases
of the Aurantiaceze ” (Rome, 1887); Halsted, ‘“‘Trigger-hairs of the Thistle-
flower” (Torr. Bull., xv); Schenck, ‘Anatomy of Water Plants” (Uhl-
worm u. Haenstein’s Bibliot. Bot., 1) ; Coulter and Rose, “ Development
of the Fruit of Umbelliferce” (Bot. Gaz., XII).

The literature relating to the fertilization of flowers has been particu-
larly extensive, and during the year much valuable information has been
obtained. Thus Hildebrandt (Bot. Zeit., XLV), has studied the fertiliza-
tion of Oxalis, and particularly the trimorphic forms. For example, in
Ovalis Bowiei the short-styled form was found to be only imperfectly
fertile when polinated with its own pollen, and the seedlings from this
form produced only mid-styled plants, while the short-styled crossed
with the mid-styled produced mid-styled plants exclusively. Manyother
equally interesting results were brought out. Burck (Ann. Jard. Bot.
Buitenzorg, vt), who has been working on heterostylism and self: fertiliza-
tion, announces the finding of transition forms between dimorphic and
trimorphic flowers in species of Conarius, Averrhoa, ete. Robertson,
(Bot. Gaz., x11), describes the method or fertilization of Calopogon parvi-
jlorus, asserting that it is accomplished by small bees; Lindman (Bot.
Centralbl., xxx11), describes methods for fertilization of certain Alpine
plants, and Magnus (Bot. Contralbl, xxx), has studied the pollina-
tion of Silene inflata. Jordan’s paper, “Beitr. z. physiologischen Or-
ganography d. Biumen ”(Ber.deutsch. Bot. Gesell., V), is one of the most
extensive. He studied flowers representing three classes, viz: Actino-
morphic honey-flowers, Actinomorphic pollen flowers, and Zygomorphic
honey-flowers. He found in all anevident adaptation for cross-fertiliza-
tion by aid of insects. The polination of Zannichellia palustris is de-
seribed by Roze (Morot’s Journ. Bot., 1). The single stamen is located
at the base of the cupuliform perigyne, which ineludes from one to six
pistils, is at first almost sessile, but just before flowering the filament
elongates and carries the anther above the pistils and the pollen in fal-
ling is caught by the funnel-shaped stigmas. MacLeod (Arch. de Biol.,
vil), has added a sort of appendix to the great work of Miiller on the

fertilization of flowers.

Of other papers on the same subject may be mentioned the following:
Robertson, ‘‘Insect Relations of Certain Asclepiads” (Bot. Gaz., X11) ;
Arcangeli, ‘Flowering of Huryale ferox” (Atti Soc. Tose. Sci.Nat., VIit) ;
Nicotra, ‘‘Pollination of Serpias” (Malpigdia, 1); Oliver, ‘‘ Pollination
of Pleurothallis ornatus” (Nature, XXxviI); Webster, ‘Fertilization of
Epipactis latifolia,” (Bot. Gaz., x11); Bateson, (Ann. Bot., 1), ‘ Effect
of Cross-Fertilization on Inconspicuous Flowers.”

Wortman has studied the rotation of tendrils and finds that the move-
ment is similar to the movement of climbing stems, being however much
more irregular. The movement in some species is not always uniform,
that is, a part of a tendril may rotate to the right and another part of
the same tendril rotate to the left. Gardner (Proc. Roy. Soc., Lond.,
XLIII), has continued his exceedingly interesting experiments on the
pulvinus of Mimosa pudica. He examined sections cut under an aqueous
solution of eosin, and found that the coloring matter penetrated and
acted upon the protoplasm of the outer cells of the convex side of the pul-
vinus, while the specially irritable tissue on the other side was left un-
stained. Electricity was then employed and the extreme delicacy of
the irritable tissue was manifest. In conclusion, Gardner states that in
his opinion the protoplasm of plant as well as animal cells is capable of
active contraction, and the movements of all irritable plant organs is due
toa definite contraction of the protoplasm. Vines (Rep. Brit. Assoc.
Adv. Sci., 1887) has extended these experiments upon Mimosa, and finds
that atropin causes the closing of the leaves or an effect similar to dark-
ness, while physoatigmin produces the opposite effect or that of light.

Elliott has given (Trans. Bot. Soc. Hdinb., xvii) a valuable résumé of
opinion in regard to the movement of water in plants. The old view
of Sachs, Unger, and others, that the water travels in the walls of the
lignified tissues, is proved by the later experiments of Van Tieghem,
Elfving, and others to be wrong, since in branches of Taxus in pigment
solution, the walls of the cells remain uncolored, while the cavities of
the cells are full of coloring matter. The weight of opinion inclines to
regard the path of the water as through the cell cavity. The part
taken by the medullary rays in the movement of water has been re-ex-
amined by Janse (Pringsheim’s Jahrb. f. Wiss. Bot. xvilI), and the
theory propounded by Godlewski is confirmed by his experiment. The
living parenchymatous elements of the wood undoubtedly take an im-
portant part in the movement of water. ‘The investigations were made
mostly with conifers, but the author thinks that it would be the same
in dycotyledons. ‘The Literature of Transpiration,” by Burgerstein
(Verhandl. k. k. Zool. Bot. Gesell. Wien, XXXVIII) is important. He
has collected a list of two hundred and thirty-six works, of greater or
less magnitude, published between 1672 and 1886. No less than six-
teen languages are represented. Henslow also has a paper on “ Trans-
piration as a function of living protoplasm,” in Journ. Linn Soe. Lond.
Bot. xxtv. Wiesner has a paper in Bot. Zeit. XLV. Christison, who has
BOTANY. 481

conducted a series of experiments to ascertain the relative monthly in-
crease in the girth of trees (Trans. Bot. Soc. Edinb., xv1t), concludes
that in Scotland the commencement of the growing season in deciduous
trees is in April, and reaches its maximum in June; that of evergreens
is earlier, attaining its maximum in May. The end of the growing
season is for both about the end of August. The “ Growth and origin
of multicellular plants” has been studied by Masser (Journ. Bot. xxv).

CHEMISTRY OF PLANTS.

Some exceedingly interesting and valuable results have lately been
brought out in regard to the sources of nitrogen in plants. The long-
current statement that plants necessarily absorb their nitrogen in a
combined form seems to require modification. Indeed Lawes and Gil-
bert some time ago pointed out that the ordinary sources of supply in
the soil will account for only a fraction of the amount used by plants.
H. Marshall Ward (Ann. Bot. 1) has given a valuable résumé of “Some
Recent Publications Bearing on the Sources of Nitrogen in Plants,”
the first of these, the now well-known paper by Frank, published in
1875, announcing the discovery of a symbiosis between the roots of cer-
tain plants, notably Cupulifere, and afungus. These fungoid growths
surround the roots by a dense mycilial web. A part of the hyphe pen-
etrate the epidermal cells of the root, while the rest act as or take the
place of root hairs, there being in these trees no root hairs developed.
The fungus, it will thus be seen, is essential to the life of the host, for
by its aid alone is it able to take up the nutritive material of the soil.
Later, in 1886, Hellriegel, director of the agricultural experimental sta-
tion at Bernberg, in conducting an extensive series of experiments to
ascertain the sources of the supply of nitrogen, reached results that
throw very considerable light upon the question of symbiosis as de-
scribed by Frank. He cultivated Graminez in soil destitute of nitro-
gen and shut off from all possible sources of supply except the free air.
After the supply of nitrogenous materials stored up in the seed had
been exhausted the plants ceased to grow, and unless furnished witlr a
fresh supply, all died. There can thus be no doubt that they are una-
ble to utilize free nitrogen from the air. On the other hand, peas cul-
tivated under precisely similar conditions continued to grow. The
only time at which the growth was stopped was when the supply in the
seed was exhausted, when there was a brief period of cessation of
growth, but this was soon overcome and the plants again became
healthy and vigorous. The question is, Whence came the nitrogen
which allowed a growth of this kind? The only answer is that it must
have come from the air, and evidently the Leguminosez possess powers
not enjoyed by the Gramine. Hellriegel noticed that the plants that
quickest recovered and were the most vigorous were those in which the
roots exhibited the largest number of the well-known tubercular swell-
ings, which, as was then known, were caused by what were called bac-

H, Mis, 142--—31

teria. Little stress was placed by Hellriegel on the observations of
Frank, but as Ward has shown in his paper “on the tubercular swell-
ings on the root of Vicia Faba” (Phil. Trans., 1887), there is a clear rela-
tion between the presence of this fungus and the power of fixing pure
nitrogen, enjoyed by Leguminous plants. A further contribution to
the same subject is given by Lawes and Gilbert in Proc. Roy. Soe.
XL.

‘¢The Comparative Chemistry of Higher and Lower Plants,” by Miss
Abbott (Am. Nat., XxI), isa very suggestive paper, although still lack-
ing confirmation in many particulars. It is claimed by the author that
a progression in chemical complexity can be traced pari passwu with
the progression in structural differentiation. Of the other papers of
more or less interest may be mentioned the following: Staco, ‘ Plant
Odors” (Bot. Gaz., x11); Schimper, ‘ Ueber Kalkoxalatbildung in den
Laubblittern” (Bot. Zeit. 46 Jahrg).

Krasser, ‘‘ Ueber den microchemiochen nachweis von Eiweiss kérpern
in den Pflanzlichen Zellhaut” (Bot. Zeit 46); “On the Nature and
Toxie Principle of the Aroidexe,” by Pedder and Warden (Journ. Asi-
atic Soc. Bengal, Lvi1).. Theauthorsbere found that the irritating effect
on tongue, stomach, ete., of the Aroidec is a purely mechanical one.
The cells of the Arums are filled with needle-shaped crystals of oxa-
late of lime and by mechanical action produce the deleterious effects ;
* The Ash of Tillandsia usneoides, by Palmer (Am. Nat. xx).

TECHNOLOGY.

The constantly increasing attention that is being given to the micro-
scopical study of plants has given rise to a copious literature of the
subject, which has been considerably added to during the year. Det-
mer’s ‘Das Pflanzenphysiologische Praktikum” is perhaps the most
important work that has appeared. The work is evidently the result
of the author’s personal experience in teaching physiology, and is a
very carefully written account of all the manipulations required to
illustrate the ordinary facts of plant physiology. The details are very
minutely given. ‘ Manipulations de Botanique, guélle pour les travaux
d histologie végétale,” by Girod, is also a valuable work. ‘The appli-
cation of the paraffin—imbedding method in Botany,” by Moll (Bot.
Gaz., XII), is a very interesting paper detailing accounts of the sucess-
ful imbedding and cutting of the most delicate vegetable tissues, such
as the growing point of roots and stems, flower buds, ete. The appli-
cation of zoological methods to botany has only recently been success-
ful, since the last edition of Strasburger’s “ Botanische Praktikum”
contains no mention of it. Schénland has also contributed observations
on the process of imbedding (Bot. Centralbl, xxx, and Bot. Gaz., XIII),
and Campbell also has a short note in Bot. Gaz., xu. Bumpus has
described (Bot, Gaz., X11) a simple and inexpensive self-registering aux-
BOTANY. 483

anometer, and Barns (op. cit) has described a registering auxanometer.
Goodall (Am. Journ. Sci. xxxv) has described a combination auxano-
meter and clinostat. Campbell has recorded some interesting experi-
ments (Bot. Gaz., X11) regarding the successful staining of the nuclei of
living cells. A 0.1 per cent. solution of dahlia, a violet-purple pigment,
was made and this diluted with from fifty to one thousand parts of water.
The object, as for example the stamen hairs of Tradescantia, on being
immersed in this solution for a time had the nuclei very deeply stained.
The ordinary protoplasmic movements were not interfered with in any
way. Campbell has also another note on the absorption of analine
colors by living cells (Bot. Gaz., x11), a continuation of investigations
first made by Pfeffer. Welling has a short paper in The Microscope,
VIII, on staining and mounting plant sections, and Doherty (Am.
Month. Mic. Journ., tX) has given extensive notes on the staining of
animal and vegetable tissues.

TEXT-BOOKS.

The following text-books have appeared during the year : ‘* Elements
of Botany,” by Gray ; ‘‘ Botanische Practicum,” second edition, by Stras-
burger; -“‘ Course of Practical Instruction in Botany,” Part 0, by Bower
and Vines; “ Elements of Botany ” by Bastin ; “A Manual of Botany,”
fifth edition, by Bently ; ‘‘ fland-Book of British Flora,” fifth edition,
Bentham and Hooker; *‘ A Primer of Botany” by Knight; ‘“Schule-
Botanik” by Krause; “ Botanique Elémentaire” by Mangin; ‘“ Lehr-
buch zum botanischen Untersicht” by Schramm; ‘ Elementary Prac-
tical Biology (vegetation),” by Shore. :

DIATOMS.

The Diatomasee collected by the Challenger expedition have been
worked up by Castracane and presented as volume It of the Botany of
the expedition. He first reviews the biology of diatoms, and writes of
geographical and bathymetrical distribution. He proposes the terms
“ valval” and “ zonal” to take place of the confusing terms “ side-view ”
and ‘end-view.” Several new genera and a host.of new species are
described. The classification followed is that proposed in 1872 by H. i.
Smith; Costracane has also a note (Atti. Accad. Pontif. Nuovi Line.
XXXVIII), recording the finding of diatoms in the stomachs of Hehiné and
Holothuree dredged from a depth 2,511 to 5,274 meters. Imhof eliims
(Biol. Centralbl., vi, that he has detected the pores through whic): pro-
toplasmic filaments are protruded in the valves of certain large species
of Surirella. Kain and Taylor have given (Torr. Bull., xrv) a list of
the diatoms found at Tampa Bay, Florida. Smith has a note on diatom
structure in Journ. Quek. Mic. Club, 1, and Schutt (Bot. Ziet., xLom),

ALG Ai.

The most important American work is the long-promised “ Fresh-
water Ale of the United States,” by Francis Wolle. It is comple-
mental to the author’s “*‘ Desmids of the United States,” which was pub-
lished in 1882, and makes two handsome volumes, one of text and one
of plates. The atlas contains 151 plates and over 2,300 illustrations,
drawn from nature by the indefatigable author himself. The classifica-
tion adopted is, so far as applicable, that employed for the Marine
Algie, viz: Rhodophycez, chlorophycex, and cyanophyce, the melan-
ophycee not being represented. The classification, however, is unex-
plained and the exact views of the author are difficult to ascertain-
The subject of polymorphism among alge is given a prominent place.

Bennett (Journ. Linn. Soc., Lond., xx1v) has recently proposed some
modificatious in the existing systems of classification of Algw, based
largely on retrogression or degeneration, which, according to the au-
thor is manifested by more or less suppression of reproduction or vege-
tative organs. He traces the various forms of vegetable life to three
lines of descent, represented by three distinct kinds of cell-contents,
viz: Colorless, blue-green, and pure green. The first, originating in
the bacteria, includes all the fungi; the second type consists of unicel-
lular organisms, in which the cell-contents is composed of pale, blue-
ereen endochrome without distinet chlorophyll-grains, starch-grains, or
nucleus. The third series, and the only one which has developed into
higher forms of vegetable life, is characterized by cells containing chlo-
rophyll-grains, starch-grains, a nucleus, and usually a true cellulose wall.

The last published part of Agardh’s ciassification of alge (Lunds
Univ. Arsskr., xxi) refers to the Siphonew. He divides the whole
group into six families: (1) Bryopsidew ; (2) Spongodiee ; (3) Udotea-
cee; (4) Valoniasew; (5) Caulerpee; (6) Dasycladex. ‘Physiol. u.
alogologische Studien,” by Hansging, Prag., 1887, is a collection of the
author’s papers published before on various algological topics. Mme.
A. Webea van Bosse has described (Nat. Verh. Holland. Maatsch der
Wettenschappen, Haarlam, 1887), the curious discovery of alge para-
sitag in the hairs of sloths. Two new genera and three new species are
characterized. Potter (Journ. Linn. Soc., Lond., xxrv) has given ob-
servations on the curious alge growing on the shell of the European
tortoise, Janse (Plasmolytische Versuch. an Algen, Bot. Centraibl.,
XXXII) shows that the living protoplasm in various alge is permeable
to dilute solutions of mineral salts and cane sugar. The plasmolysis
completety disappears in two hours, and after four days the cells have
regained their former turgidity. “ Zur Entwicklungsges einiger Con-
fervaceen,” by Langerheim, is an interesting paper on the development
of confervacee. The sensitiveness of Spirogyra to shock is described
by Coulter (Bot, Gaz., x11). He finds that when the filaments are cut
through with a sharp instrument, eight or ten cells nearest the point

of laceration show remarkable changes in their protoplasmic contents,
the bands of chlorophyll being broken. Cooke’s finely illustrated work
on * British Desmids” has reached parts 7-10. Oliver has a valuable
paper ‘¢On the Obliteration of Sieve-tubes in Laminaries ” (Ann. Bot.,
1); Holmes has a short note (Trans. Bot. Soc., Edinb., xvi), on the frue-
tification of Sphacelaria radicans and SN. olivacea; Scott, “On Nuclei
in Oscillaria and Tolypothrix,” (Journ. Linn. Soc., Lond., xxrv) ; Nord-
stedt, “The fresh-water Algw of New Zealand,” (see Bot. Centralbl.,
Xxx1); Piecone, ‘‘ Dessemination of Algve by Fish” (Nuov. Giorn. Bot.,
Ital., XIX).
CHARACE&.

Dr. Allen has given the results of his long-continued studies of those
little-known plants in his “ Characez of America,” part I. This part is
devoted to the introduction, morphology, and classification, the descrip-
tive portion being reserved for a final part. The key to the classifica-
tion is translated from Nordstedt, with additions of American species
detected since its original publication. The Characee are world-wide
in distribution and number in all something over two hundred forms,
distributed as follows: Nitella, 93 species and varieties; Tolypella, 15;
Lamprothamnus, 4; Lichnothamnus, 3; Chara, 102. The same author has
given (Torr. Bull., xtv) notes on Characez, in which several new forms
are described:  Nitella Muthnatafrom the Feejee Islands; N. Morongii,
from Nantucket, and Yolypella (afterwards changed to Nitella) Macounii,
from the Niagara River. Vines has a short note on Apospory in Characee
in Ann. Bot., 1. Knowlton (Bot. Gaz., x11) has described a fossil species
of Chara (C. compressa) from the Wasatch group at Wales, Utah. This
is the second American species found fossil, the other (C. glomerata Lz.)
being from the Green River group at Florissant, Colorado.

FUNGI.

The activity in the investigation of fungi still continues unabated,
and although few large works have appeared during the year, much
material, in the form of short papers containing descriptions of new
species, revision of genera, ete., has been contributed.

The most important general work is the continuation of Saccardo’s
“Sylloge Fungorum.” De Bary’s excellent work has been translated
by Garnsey under the title of “Comparative Morphology and Biology
of the Fungi, Mycetoza and Bacteria.” It is indispensable to all ele-
mentary students- of these groups, and is the best working book that
we have. Burrell and Earll’s “ Parasitic Fungi of Illinois, the Eresi-
phee,” is one of the most valuable American publications. It describes
about forty species and reduces many so-called species. to synonyms
of well-known forms. Cohn’s ‘‘ Kryptogamen Flora vy. Schlesein,
Pilze,” for which Schreter is preparing the fungi, has reached the
second part. It concludes the description of the Myxogastres, and
A86 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

embraces the Schigomycetes, Zygomycetes, and Oomycetes. Raben-
horst’s ‘“‘Krypogamen Flora v. Deutschland u. s. w., Pilze,” has
reached parts 27 and 28, being the last contribution from the lamented
Winter. Part 27 completes the Sphaeriacez and includes the small
sub-order Dothideacew. Part 28 commences the Hysteriaceze and em-
braces the families Hysterinee, Hypodermize, and Dichaenacez.
“ Cooke’s Hlustrations of British Fungi” has now reached parts 46 to 48.

Martin’s “Enumeration and Description of the Septorias of North
America” (Journ. Mic., 111) includes one hundred and eighty-eight species
of Septoria, eight of Pleospora, twenty of Rhabdospora, and eight of
Phlyctena. He also gives a convenient index to the species and a Jist
of the host-plants. “The Synopsis of North American Species of
Xylaria and Poronia,” by Ellis and Everhart (J.¢., 111), describes thirty
species of Xylaria and two speciesof Poronia. The same authors have
a ‘Synopsis of the North American Species of Hapoxylon and Num-
mularia (l.¢., Iv). Phillips’ ‘Manual of British Discomycetes,” recently
published as a volume of the International Scientifie Series, will be
useful to American as well as English students, as many of the species
described are common to both countries. The work describes nine
orders, forty-nine genera and about six hundred species. The genus
Phleospora has been monographed by Berllase (Nuov. Giorn. Bot. e¢ al.,
xx), who makes out about one hundred and five species, and DeToni
(Rev. Mycol., July, 1887) has a “Revisio Monographica Geasteris e.
Tribu Geasteromycetum.” He recognizes forty-eight species, and Mor-
gan, who reviewed the paper in Am. Nat., xx1, describes two additional
species from Nebraska. ‘Les Hymenomycetes D’Europe,” by Potouil-
lard, is also a valuable work. As this is the first volume of “ Materi-
aux pour L’Historie des Champignons,” it is devoted to general
anatomy and classification.

Of exsicati, Ellis’ “ North American Fungi” has reached centuries
20 and 21, and Roumeguere’s ‘Fungi selecti exiscati precepue Galliz
et Algereve” has passed through centuries XLII-XLV.

Farlow and Trelease have done a most valuable work in compiling
‘A list of Works on North American Fungi,” which is issued by the li-
brary of Harvard College. The report of the botanist of the State of
New York, Peck, in “ Fortieth Ann. Rept. N. Y. State Mus. Nat. Hist.
for 1886,” contains descriptions of about forty new species.

As it is impossible to attempt anything like a complete enumeration
of all the work that has been done, the following list of articles that
have appeared in American periodicals, with a few of the more im-
portant foreign papers, will convey some idea of its magnitude. The
following have appeared in the Journal of Micology from July, 1887, to
June, 1888: Calkins, “‘ Notes on Florida Fungi;” Ellis and Everhart,
‘¢ New Kansas Fungi, Additions to Hypocreacez, New Species of Fungi
from various localities, New Iowa Fungi, Additions to Ramularia;”

Harkness (Bull. Cal. Acad. Sci.) ; ‘* Polyporus sanguineus and other
Fungi of the White Cedar,” by P. H. Dudley (Journ. N. ¥. Mic. Soce.).

A few of the papers in foreign periodicals are: Trail, ‘* Revision of
Scotch Shpxropsidew and Melanconiex » (Scotch Nat., July 15, 1887);
Monten, “ Ascomycetes observ aux enverons de Liege” (Bull. Soe. Roy.
Bot. d Belgique); Bornet, “Du Parasitisme der Touffles” (Rev. Mycol.,
1887); Barclay, “Descriptive list of Uredinew in the neighborhood of
Simla, Western Himalaya” (Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal,Lv1). In Grev-
iliea Cooke has several articles: “ New Australian Fungi,” “ New Brit-
ish Fungi,” ‘‘Some Exotic Fungi.” Massee has also an article (Ul. ¢.)
on “ British Pyrenomycetes.” Points in the comparative anatomy of
Uredinee are presented by Dietel in Bot. centralbl XXXII; Classifica-
tion of Agaricinee is taken up by Potouillard (Morot’s Journ. d Bot., 1) 5

Nonnulli,” by Spegazzine and Ito (Journ. Linn. Soe. Lond., XXIV).

DISEASES OF PLANTS.

In speaking of the fungus diseases of plants under a separate head-
ing the impression should not be conveyed that they differ from fungi
in general. It is simply a convenient way of treating of those forms
that are especially injurious to cultivated plants. The extent of the
annual injury done to agricultural interests by the attacks of parasitic
fungi is little appreciated by the community at large. Even when it
is understood that the injury is caused by parasitic plants, so little is
known of their nature and conditions of growth that no very effective
488 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

remedial measures can be employed against them. It is only by eare-
fully studying their life history that methods of prevention or cure can
be suggested. Various governments, but especially those of France
and the United States, have undertaken systematic investigations of
the life history of the injurious forms. Prof. P. Viala, as the represent-
ative of French interests, has visited this country and studied the
wild grapes and the various fungi found affecting them.

The section of vegetable pathology of the U. S. Department of Agri-
culture, under Prof. F. Lamson Scribner, has accomplished valuable
work in this direction. His report (Ann. Rep. Dept. Ag., 1887), which
embraces about seventy-five pages, is illustrated by seventeen plates,
and deals with the diseases of the vine, the potato blight and rot, straw-
berry-leaf blight, apple scab, rust of beets, leaf rust of cherry, plum,
peach, etc., cotton-leaf blight, anthracnose of the raspberry and black-
berry, smut of Indian corn, corn rust, ete. The Department has also
issued a Bulletin (No. 5) containing a report on experiments made in
1887 on the treatment of the downy mildew and black rot of the grape-
vine. In a former Bulletin (No. 2) the life history of these highly de-
structive parasites had been treated, and in this, the best method for
controlling them are described and discussed.

‘¢ Les Maladies de la Vigne” is the title of a large work by Professor
Viala. <A long list of species is enumerated, among which one hundred
and fifty species are regarded as accidental, one hundred as saprophytic,
and twenty-five as parasitic. The larger portion of the work is devoted
to a few well-known destructive forms, such as Peronospora viticola,
Oidium Tucreri, ete. “Le Black Rot et le Coniotherium diplodiella”
is a well-written pamphlet of eighty pages by Viala and Ravaz. M.
Priellieux (Compt. Rend., cv) has an article on the grape disease
(Conotherium diplodiella). He concludes that it is a true parasite.
Gasperini (Atti Tose. Soc. Sci. Nat., Vim1) describes a new disease ot
lemons, a species of Aspergillus. Vuillemin (Morot’s Journ. Bot., 1)
writes of the ‘“ Disease affecting cherry and plum trees.” The disease
of tomatoes (Dactylium roseum, var.,) is described by W. G. Smith in
Gard. Chron., August, 1887. “A new fungus disease of the vine” is
characterized by Scribner and Viala in Agricult. Sci., September, 1887.
The species is named Greeneria fulginea, and is both saprophytic and
parasitic. Itis reported to be very destructive to fruit in some parts
of North Carolina. ‘'The curl of peach leaves” is described by Knowles
in Bot. Gaz., XII.

LICHENS.

The much-needed help to the study of the North American Lichens has
been furnished by Willey’s “Introduction.” Although a pamphlet of
only fifty-eight pages, it contains chapters on the collecting and mount-
ing of Lichens ; on their structure and organs; their geographical dis-
tribution. There is a key to the seventy-six genera, enumerated as in-
BOTANY. A89

habitants of North America, and also a list of all the species, with an
indication of their habitat. The work is accompanied by ten plates,
illustrating the spores of each genus as well other parts, such as
gonidia, apotheceine, spermogones, pyenides, ete. The much-discussed
question of the autonomy of Lichens still remains a mooted point. Thus
Willey, in the above paper, concludes that “for the present and for
practical purposes the Lichen remains a Lichen,” while Forssell, “‘ Beitr.
z. Kennt. d. Anatomie u. Systematic d. Gloeslichtenen” (Nov. Act. Reg.
Soe. Scient. Upsal, vit), describes a new family of the class Ascolichens
with the gonidia belonging to the Chroococcace, and Massee (Phil.
Trans., CLXXVI1), under the name Gastrolichens, describes a form pro-
duced by the union of a fungus belonging to the order Trichogastres
with a unicellular alga. Moller has furnished the results of the eulti-
vation of Lichen-forming Ascomycetes without algze (Unters. Bot.
Inst. k. Akad. Munster-in-Westfalen, 1887). Recognizing the fact that
light on this subject can only be obtained by cultivating gonidia alone
or synthetically combining spores and gonidia, he has turned his atten-
tion to the culture of spores. Contrary to the common statement that
hyphe coming from germinating Lichen spores necessarily die in a short
time if gonidia are not supplied, he found that if germinated in a suit-
able culture medium the hyphe produced ‘small characteristic
thalli. without any trace of gonidia whatever.” These he had at the
time of writing kept alive three months, and although they had not
produced apothecia there were indications that these were being
formed. He also concluded that the spermatia are not male reproduc-
tive organs, as has been supposed by some.

Of the shorter papers Willey has described a new species (Dermatiscum
Catarwbanse) from ——— (Torr. Bull., x1v); Knowlton has enumerated
(Bot. Gaz. X111) several species found attached to some of the stone idols
lately brought to the U. 8. National Museum from the Easter Islands,
and Hekfeldt and Calkins have published a ‘+ Lichen Flora of Florida”
(Journ. Micology’s, 111), enumerating three hundred and thirty species, a
few of which are new. Bonnier’s “La Constitution des Lichens” (Journ.
d. Botanique, 1887) is an interesting paper.

HEPATIC Ai.

The distribution of the Italian species of Hepatic is considered by
Massalongo (Atti Congr. Naz. Bot. Critt., Parma, September, 1887), and
Underwood has written of some undescribed forms from California
(Bot. Gaz., x11). He describes five species that had been sent by Bo.
lander in 1866 to Dr. Gottsche but were never published. Goebel has
an interesting paper (Ann. Jard. Bot., Buitenzorg, vit), in which he
describes some curious appliances for storing water in the epiphytic
Jungermannice of Java. Trabus has a paper in Rev. Bryol., 1887,
‘¢Mousses et Hépatiques nouvelles @’Algérie.”
490 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.
MOSSES.

Of the larger systematic works Braithwait’s “ British Moss Flora”
has reached part X, completing volume 1, and Rabenhorst’s ‘ Crypto-
gamen-Flora vy. Deutschland u.s. w.” has reached numbers 7 and 8,
being still occupied with the Acrocarpe. Both of these publications
still maintain the uniform high character of the earlier parts. Philibert
has a short paper (Rev. Bryol., xtv) on the fructification of Grimmia
Hartmanni, in which he concludes that it should be placed among the
true Grimmia and near to G. contorta Wahl, The same author has
also another paper (Ul. ¢.) ‘‘ Contrib. a la flore mycologique de la Greece.
Arcangeli (Atti Soe. Tose, Nat., v) states that a useful character for
some species of moss * can be drawn from the fact that in some forms
the nervation of the leaves ends in a small projecting point or tooth
and in addition to this presents another small tooth pointing downwards
below the opical tooth.” Species of Rhyncostegium and Brachythecium
are enumerated. Several hybrid mosses are described by Sanio (Hed-
wigia, XXVI), and the “Anatomy and Development of the Sporostegium
of Mosses,” by Vaizey in Journ. Linn. Soe., Lond., xxtv. Inthe “ Sphag-
nacere of North America” (Bull. Soc. roy. de Bot. Belgique, xxv),
Cardot proposes some changes in our species. He admits sixteen
species and nine varieties as compared with twenty seven species in
Lesquereux and James’ “ Manual.” “Die Entwick.d. Sporogone v. An-
dree u. Sphagnum,” by Waldner,is a valuable contribution to our
knowledge of the development of the sporogonium of these genera, and
the paper is further enriched by systematic notes by Miiller. Varia-
tions in Sphagnacee are described by Jansen (Rev. Bryol, XIv).

FERN-ALLIES.

Baker’s “ Hand-book of the Fern-Allies ” is by far the most valuable
contribution that has appeared during the year on the systematic study
of the related members of the Pteridophyta. Itis similarin its method
of treatment to the author’s well-known ‘Synopsis Filicum.” It in-
cludes descriptions of 565 species, distributed at follows: Hquisetacea,
20 species ; Lycopodiacew, 98 species; distributed among Phylloglossura,
1, Lycopodium, 94; Tmesipteris, 1; Psilotum, 2; Selaginellacece, 383
species, of which Selaginella has 334, and Isoetes, 49; Rhizocarpew, 64
species, distributed among Salvinia, 13; Azolla, 5; Marsillia, 40, and
Pilularia, 6.

In the Lquicetacee Buchtien has given a short paper (Uhlworm u.
Haenlein Biblioth. Bot., vi11), in which he points out the difference be-
tween the male and female prothalli. ‘Some words on the life-history
of Lycopods” (Ann. Bot., 1) by Treub, is a suggestive paper. He has
studied the prothalli of four species before unknown, of which number
three belong to the Phlegmaria type, and one to the cernuum type.
The annotinum type, the third into which Lycopodium is divided, is still
; BOTANY. 491

imperfectly known. This genus, as is well known, played an important
part in past geological time, and the modern forms are seemingly but
poor representations, but as Treub suggests, it is more than probable
that when the life-history of each form is made out some important gen-
eralizations in connection with what is known of the fossil form will be
possible. Goebel is also working in similar lines and has recently de-
scribed (Bot. Zeitg., XLV) the prothallium of LZ. inundatum, confirming
previous observations that it belongs to the cernuum type.

The genus Jsoetes which is generally much neglected by botanists is
treated geographically by Underwood (Bot. Gaz., x11). It embraces
fifty-three well-marked species of worid-wide distribution. Europe has
thirteen species; Africa, ten ; Asia, six; Australia, eight ; South Amer-
ica, six; and North America, nineteen species, two of which are here
described as new.

FERNS.

About the usual annual amount of work seems to have been done on
the ferns without, however, producing anything of particular moment.
Bower (Trans. Linn. Soc., Lond., 2d ser., 11) has described and dis-
cussed at considerable length the discovery of apospory in ferns. This
phenomenon, which is simply a transition by direct vegetative process,
and without the assistance of spores, from the sporophore to the oophore,
was first defined by Pringsheim and Stahl in 1876, but has only recently
been detected in ferns. Goebel (Ann. Jard. Bot., Buitenzorg, VII) , has
given a long paper desvribing the germination of several little-known
species, among them Vittaria, Trichomanes, and Hymenophyllum. The
same author has a paper, ‘“ Ueb. kiinstliche Vergriindung d. Sporo-
phyll v. Onoclea Struthiopteris” (Ber. deutsch. Bot. Gesell.,,V) describ-
ing the conversion of fertile sporophyils of Onoclea into barren green
fronds. The development of the sporangium of the Polypodiacez is
described by Kindig (Hedwigia, xxvi11), and the “ Dehisence of the
Sporangium of Adiantum pedatum,” by Miss Lyon (Torr. Bull., xrv),
Campbell’s paper “On the development of the Ostrich Fern Onoclea
Struthioptoris” (Mem. Boston Soe. Nat. Hist., IV) is a very carefully
prepared paper on the histology and development.

Baker has given several descriptive papers: “A further collection of
ferns from West Borneo.” (Journ. Linn. Soc., Lond., xxtv); ‘Ona col-
lection of fernsfrom San Domingo” (Journ. Bot., XXV1I), in which several
new species are characterized. Beddome has a short paper enumerating
a collection made in Perak and Penang (Journ. Bot., xxv1), and Forbes,
(/. c.) has described a single new species (Polypodium Annabelle) from
New Guinea. Nephrolepis acuta is reported from the vicinity of Miami
River, Flerida, by Holden (Torr. Bull., x1v). Rabenhorst’s “ Kryp-
togamen Flora v. Deutschland u. s. w.” has reached parts 8 to 10 of
the vascular cryptogams. It completes the Polypodiacee and includes
descriptions of the German species of Osmundiacew, Ophioglossacee
492 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

and Rhizocarpee, and commences the Hquisetacee. Hach species is care-
fully illustrated. Underwood’s “Our Ferns and their Allies” has now
reached a third edition. It deseribes about one hundred and sixty-five
species and several varieties of ferns as native of North America, north
of Mexico. One of the most important additions to the “ tern-allies” is
the genus Salvinia reported from Missouri.

ANTHOPHYTA.

The number of papers of more or less magnitude that have appeared
during the year are very great, and considerably in excess of the pro-
duction of most former years. In America, while most of the papers
have been short, many of them are of’ considerable value.

The most extensive papers have been numbers xiv and xvof Watson’s
“ Contributions to American Botany.” The first of these, issued in
1887, is largely taken up with a iist of the plants selected by Dr. Ed-

yvard Palmer in the State of Jalisco, Mexico, in 1886. The Gamopetale
were determined by Dr. Gray; the Juncacace and Cyperacee by Britton;
the Graminee by Vasey, and the Filices, by Eaton. The whole collec:
tion includes about six hundred and seventy-five species, with a consid-
erable proportion of species new to science. The last part of the paper
contains descriptions of over forty new species of American plants from
various localities. Part xv, issued May, 1888, contains an enumeration
of new American plants with revisions of Lesquerella (old Vesicaria)
and of the North American species of Draba. Of Draba, thirty-two
species and several varieties are described. It also contains descrip-
tions of over fifty new species of Mexican plants, chiefly collected by
Pringle in the mountains of Chihuahua, and descriptions of a few plants
of Guatemala. Gray’s last paper, which was presented to the Academy
of Arts and Sciences after his death, by Watson, consists of notes upon
the Rutacew and Vitaceew, the study of which he had taken up immedi-
ately on his return from his last European trip.

The Smithsonian Institution has issued a second edition of Gray’s
‘‘Synoptical Flora of North America,” Gamopetale, which forms vol-
ume XxXxt of its Misceilaneous Collections. In this form it is distribu-
ted to libraries and institutions of learning in all parts of the world,
as well as to many of its private correspondents, to whom it is known
that it would be of special value.

Of the foreign works Hillebrand’s “Flora of the Hawaiian Islands” is
one of the most extensive and valuable. Insular floras have always a
peculiar interest, and “‘few are more interesting than the Hawaiian
Islands.” The work describes 844 species of Phanerogams, belonging
to 335 genera, and 155 Pteridophytes, representing 80 genera, being a
total of 999 species. Of this number itis thought that 115 species have
been introduced since the discovery by Captain Cook in 1779, and 24
species by natives before this time. There remains 860 species as
original residents, of which number 653, or over 75 per cent., are endemic,
BOTANY. 493

About 250 of these endemic species belong to endemic genera. Of the
dicotyledons more than 85 per cent. of these species are endemic. The
“Flora Miquelonenis,” by M. M. Delamare, Renauld, and Cardot is
another insular flora. ‘The Island of Miquelon, which is just off the
south shore of Newfoundland, has been very carefully explored and the
results here presented. About 46 per cent. of the species observed are
American. Mueller still continues his indefatigable labors on the Aus-
tralian flora. His “ Iconography of Australian species of Acacia and
cognate genera” has reached decade 11 and is similar in appearance to
his well-known ‘“‘Eucclyptographia.” Forbes and Hemesley have inaugu- —
rated a most valuable work, “An Enumeration of all the plants known
from China proper, Formosa, Hainan, Corea, the Luchu Archipelago,
and the Island of Hong Kong, together with their distribution and syn-
onomy.” It is published in the Jour. Linn. Soc., Lond., and has now
reached part V, taking it through the Composite. The “ Botany of the
Roraima Expedition of 1884,” by F. im Thurn, assisted by Oliver, Rid-
ley, Baker, and others (Trans. Linn. Soe., Lond., 2d ser., 11), is another
valuable paper. It enumerates three genera and fifty-three species
new to science. Of similar scope is the “ Enumeration of the plants
collected by Mr. H. H. Johnston on the Kilima-Najaro expedition of
1884,” by Oliver and other of the officers of the Kew Herbanium, and
the ‘‘ Botany of the Afghan Delimitation Commission,” by Aitchison,
both of which appear in Trans. Linn. Soc., Lond., 2d ser., 1. King’s
“The species of Ficus of the Indo-Malayan and Chinese countries” is
a magnificent contribution, in two large volumes, to our knowledge of
the perplexing genus Ficus. Over two hundred species are déscribed
and two hundred and twenty-five plates devoted to their illustration.
The synonomy, distribution, etc., are very completely presented. The
continuation of De Candolle’s Prodromus, under the title of ** Mono-
graphee Phanerogamarum,” still progresses. The present volume by
Planchon is devoted to the Ampelidee. In the volume of the “ Pro-
dromus,” issued in 1824, that contained the Ampelidez, only one hun-
dred and eight species were known, while the present monograph in-
cludes three hundred and ninety species. Some of the radical changes
in nomenclature proposed by Planchon are not likely to meet with uni-
versal acceptance. The paper “ Serjania Sapindacearum Genus mouno-
graphica descriptum,” by Radelkofer (Trans. Roy. Bav. Acad., 1875) is
now supplemented by two hundred pages and nine plates.

‘ Biologia Centrali-Americana,” by Hemsley, has reached part XXII;
the “Flora of British India,” by Hooker, has reached part Xxrv, com-
pleting the Euphorbiace; and the “ Flora Italiana” of Parlatore, con-
tinued by Caruél, has reached vol. viz. Of Hooker’s “Icones Plantarum,”
parts I-10, vol. VIII, have appeared during the year. Each contains
twenty-five plates of new or little known species.

The shorter American notes and papers have been exceedingly
humerous, We may mention the following:
494 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

‘¢ New or rare plants,” by Dr. Gray (Bot. Gaz., x111), is the best con- .
tribution of the Nestor of American botany. It enumerates only four _
species. The Botanical Gazette, x11, has an account of “An excursion
to the Platte,” by Thompson ; “ Proteogyne in Datura meteloides,” by
Schneck; *‘ Fertilization of Calopogon parviflorus,” by Robertson. Vol.
xi contains ‘ Notes on North American willows,” by Bebb; ‘‘ Notes
on the Flora of James Bay,” by Macoun; “‘A New Water Lily” (Castalia
Leibergi) from the Northwest; ‘Phacelia heterosperma, n. sp.,” by
Parish; ‘‘ Notes on Carex, No. 1x,” by Bailey; ‘ Notés on some Illinois
Grapes,” by Schneck (six species are enumerated); ‘‘ Prunus pumila in
North Carolina,” by Memminger; ‘+ Notes on Western Umbelliferie,” by
Coulter and Rose; ‘ Erigeron Tweedyi, n. sp.,” from Southwestern Mon-
tana, by Canby; ‘‘ Undescribed Plants from Guatemala,” by Smith.

The Torry Bulletin, vol. xtv, contains many articles. Among them
are ‘ Bibliographical notes on well-known plants,” by Green; ‘¢A
supposed new genus of Anacardiacee (Sycocarpus),” by Britton, “The
Genera Echinocystis Migarrhiza and Echinopepon,” by Watson; ‘‘ A
new variety of Aralia nudicauli L.,” by Apgar; ‘‘ Note on Sarracenia
variolaris,” by Pierce; vol. xv, contains the following:

‘‘Sherardia arvensis,” by Meehan; “Remarks on the Group Caro-
lineze of the genus Rosa,” by Best, describes Rosa humilis Marshall, and
the varieties lucida and villosa ; ‘‘Studies in the Typhacee,” by Morong;
‘“Re-discovery of Nymphaea elegans, Hook., by Stearns, reports this
beautiful species from Waco, central Texas, where it has remained .
unique since it was first collected by Wright in 1849; “New or Note-
worthy North American Phanerogams,” by Britton; and Bebb has an
article on “ White Mountain Willows.”

A number of papers on grasses and cyperacee have appeared, of which
we may mention “Grasses of North America for Farmers and Stu-
dents,” by W. J. Beal. It contains chapters ‘on the structure, form,
and development of the grasses, power of motion, plant growth, classi- _
fication, native grazing lands, grasses for cultivation, early attempts to ,
cultivate grasses, testing seeds, grasses for pastures and meadows, ,
preparation of the soil, care of grass land, etc.” It will be followed by ,
a second volume, which will contain descriptions of the North American .
species. Flint’s well-known ‘Grasses and Forage Plants,” has been
revised and a new edition published during the year. Vasey has papers
on “ Redfieldia, a New Genus of Grasses,” “‘New Western Grasses,” and
‘¢ New or Rare Grasses,” in Torr. Bull., and a “Synopsis of the Genus
Panicum,” in Bot. Gaz., x11. Seribner has notes on “ New or Little- |
known Grasses,” in ‘Torr. Bull., xv, and Beal on ‘‘ The Rootstocks of
Leersia and Muhlenbergia,” in Am. Nat., xxl. Websteria, a new-genus
in Oyperacee, is described: by Wright (Torr. Bull., xv), from-Valusia
County, Florida. The plant is entirely submerged.

The American Naturalist has short articles, by Bessey, on ‘‘ The East-
ward Extension of Pinus ponderosa, var. scorpulorum,” “The Western
BOTANY. 495

Extension of the Black Walnut,” “Still another Tumble-weed (Cyclo-
doma platyphyllum),” and the “Grass Flora of the Nebraska Plains.”
Also a note on “An Overlooked Function of Many Fruits.” He thinks
that the “greening” of young fruits, such as those of Ulmus, Negundo,
ete., is to aid in the development of the embryo, since at the time when
it is forming there are no leaves. The American Naturalist has also a
long paper on “ Evolution in The Plant Kingdom,” by Coulter, and a
note by Ed. Palmer on ‘The Effect on Vegetation of the Variable Rain-
fall of Northwest Mexico.” Sturtevant has continued his notes on the
‘Origin of Garden Vegetables.”

Parry (Bull. Cal. Acad. Sci., 11) has a valuable paper on the California
Menzanetas, “A partial revision of the Uva-urse section of the genus
Arctoetaphylos,” as represented on the North American Pacific coast.
He enumerated thirteen species, of which one is extra limital, and sev-
eral are either new or newly characterized. Curran (op. cit.) has a note
on the ‘Priority of Dr. Kellogg’s Genus Marah over Megarrhiza.”

Pittonia is the name of a botanical publication that has been begun
by Edward Lee Green, of the University of California. It consists of
a series of papers, usually short, devoted mainly to Western plants,
descriptions of new species, critical notes, etc. Following is a list of
the most important articles: No. 1, “Some West American species
of Trifolium;” ‘‘Some West American Asperifolex;” ‘The species of
Zauscheria;” “A New Genus of Asteroid Composite (Hazzardia) ;”
‘*New Species, mainly California.” No. 2, “A Curious Collinsia;”
“Some West American Asperifolee, 11;” ‘Miscellaneous Species,
New or Rare ;” “A Botanical Excursion to the Island of San Miguel; ”
“ Catalogue of the Flowering Plants of the Island of San Miguel.” No.
3, ‘* West American Phases of the Genus Polentilla;” Some Ameri-
can Polemoniacex ;” ‘New or Noteworthy Species ;” ‘‘ Echinoeystis

‘“New Species from Mexico;” ‘New or Noteworthy Species, 11;”
‘Botanical Literature, Old and New ;” “The Botany of Cedros Island ;”
“* List of Cedros Island Plants ;” ‘*On Some Species of Dodecathion.”

The shorter foreign papers have also been exceedingly numerous,
but only a few of them can be mentioned: Baker’s ‘Synopsis of Til-
andsive ” was continued into 1888, and completed in the June number of
the Journ. Bot. Two hundred and forty-one species are enumerated,
a large proportion of which are new to science. Dietz (Abhandl. Na-
turwiss. Ver., Bremen, IX) has investigated Sparganium and Typha, and
concludes that that they should be placed under distinct families;
Sparganium having nearest affinities to the Pandanacew and Typha to
the Aroidew. Hooker has described, under the name of Hydrothrix, a
remarkable new genus of Pontederiacee (Aun. Bot., 1). Ridley (Journ.
Linn. Soc., Lond., xx1v) describes a new genus of Orchidacee from the
Island of St. Thomas, West Africa. Ward’s article on “Fruits aud
Seeds of Rhamnus (Ann, Bot., 1) is devoted to an investigation of the
496 RECORD OF SCIENUE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

sources of coloring-matter in certain species. ‘A Second Series of New
Species of Ficus from New Guinea,” and ‘Some New Species of Ficus
from Samatra,” by King (Journ. Asiatic Soc., Bengal, LVI), are addi-
tions to the great work on Ficus mentioned before. Huxley has an
interesting paper (Journ. Linn. Soc., Lond., xxiv) on Gentians, their
variations, relationships, ete. Ito (op. cit.) has described a curious spe-
cies of Belanophora new to the Japanese flora. ‘The Nomenclature of
Nymphiea” is reviewed by Brittin (Journ. Bot., xxv1). It is shown that
the species of Nymphea, Smith, 1808-09, must be transferred to Cas-
talia, Salisbury, 1805, and the species of Nuphar, Smith, 1808~09=
Nymphea, Salisbury, 1805. Bennett has an account of the British
species of Hpilobium (Trans. Bot. Soc, Edinb., xv). Twelve species
and several forms are enumerated.

ANTHROPOLOGY FOR 1887 AND 1888.

By Otis T. MASON.

INTRODUCTION.

The record of progress in anthropology during the years 1887 and
1888 includes publications of general and of special significance. For
the sake of convenience, following the suggestion of Dewey in his deci-
mal classification of knowledge, this summary will commence with the
encyclopedic portion of anthropology. To render this portion more
easy of reference, the following order may be observed :

(0) General treatises, including addresses, courses of lectures, bibli-
ographies, dictionaries, encyclopedias, collections of materials for study,
general discussions, classifications of anthropology.

(1) Societies, their history, scope, and enterprises, and a list of their
publications.

(2) Journals, proceedings, transactions, organs of associated bodies.

(3) Periodicals, like the Revue d’Anthropologie, etc., devoted to the
subject of anthropology at large.

(4) Congresses, caucuses, general assemblies for some special occa-
sion, Compte-rendus.

(5) Laboratories and apparatus of research, in which the whole ground
is covered. Special laboratories, such as Francis Galton’s, for socio-
logical inquiries, or Wundt’s, in psycho-physies, should be described
under their appropriate head.

(6) Museums and collections. A properly arranged account of all
collections, with their specialties, would save much tiresome hunt and
enlarge the results of our work.

(7) Galleries or collections of anthropological illustrations. Little
has been done to perfect this side of anthropology.

(8) Libraries, catalogues of books on anthropology, check-lists, and
similar devices for ready reference, classifications of books.

(9) Instructions to collectors.

Works on the general subject of the natural history of man have been
published in the two years covered by this summary by Herr Schaaff-
hausen, Serrurier and de Quatrefages, Hovelacque and Hervé, Canes-
trini, Friedrich Ratzel, Johannes Ranke, O. T. Mason, J. Lippert, E.
Morselli, and Sayce.

498 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

There is as yet no catalogue or list of anthropological societies avail-
able. The greatest journals, such as Archiv, Correspondenz- Blatt,
Revue @’ Anthropologie, and Archivio, furnish each résumés of meetings
held and.of work done, which might be easily combined into a general
directory. It is understood that Mr. Henry Phillips, of Philadelphia,
will undertake a work of this kind for our own country.

The journals and kindred publications of societies, periodicals pub-
lished for subscription, and Comptes-rendus of societies, fall into the
same general scheme, and may be considered together. There is a
growing desire for information about what the world is doing in this
most interesting of all sciences. In spite of all that has been said or
may be said, there will always be most excellent treatises printed in out-
of-the-way places. Friendship, and the good prices paid by popular
magazines, will allure good material away from its legitimate home.
Nevertheless, with our present system of bibliographical appendices, a
few publications can be mentioned that unitedly include about all that
is worthy of notice.

In our own country there are but two cities where the whole ground
of anthropology is sought to be covered, Cambridge and Washington.
In the former city the Peabody Museum, re-enforced by the library of
Harvard University and the lectures delivered under its auspices, occu-
pies all the fields of research. In Washington the Congressional Li-
brary, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, the Army

Medical Museum, the Library of the Surgeon-General, with its Index-

Catalogue and the Index Medicus; the Bureau of Ethnology, and the
Anthropological Society of Washington, not to speak of a dozen other
contributory departments and bureaus; all these, taken together, fur-
nish a band of workers, a body of material, and a series of publications
that will compare favorably with those of London, Paris, and Berlin.

There are museums, societies, aud other means of study in Salem,
Worcester, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati, St. Louis,
Davenport, Milwaukee, and San Francisco not to be overlooked. Dr.
Brinton, of Philadelphia, was the first anthropologist in our country to
bear the title of professor in a regular university.

The State historical societies are all more or less busy in gathering
the material for local history.

Among foreign resources of study, in addition to the old societies
now approaching manhood’s years, a fact worthy of special notice is
the establishment at Leyden, under favorable auspices, of the Interna-
tionales Archiv., devoted especially to the interchange of information

’ and courtesies between museums. The editor, Mr. J. D. EK. Schmelz, has

been very active in gathering summaries of information about many
publie collections.

Under the head of congresses must be included the anthropological
section of the American Association, of the British Association, of the
French Association, the German Allgemeine Versammlung der deutschen
Gesellschaft fiir Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte, the Con-
gres des Américanistes, and the International Congress of Anthropol-
ogy and Prehistoric Archeology.

A systematic bibliography of anthropology has not yet been at-
tempted. The nearest approach to the subject is the Smithsonian sum-
maries and the lists given in the German Archiv. Excellent special
lists will be noticed under their appropriate heads, which, if brought
together, would nearly complete the work. It is to be hoped that all
bibliographers will adopt the order and plan pursued by the authors of
the Index-Catalogue of the Surgeon-General’s Library. This would avoid
confusion in transferring titles from one work to another. For instance,
Fauvelle (Dr.) Des causes (erreur en anthropologie. Bull. Soc. @an-
throp. de Par., 3. s., x, 263-275; or, in case of a published volume, Ho-
velacque(Abel). Précis @’anthropologie (Bibliotheque anthropologique).

In quoting from a magazine, journal, or other serial the order should
be: (1) author; (2) title of extract; (3) journal, always abbreviated by
the Surgeon-General’s code; (4) town, publisher, series, volume, date,
number of pages, maps, plates, and figures, and, finally the size.

In giving the title of a printed book the same order of author and title

are to be observed. Then comes the place of publication, the date in

parenthesis, the publisher, the pages, etc., as in extracts from journals.

In the Bulletin of the Anthropological Society of Lyon, E. Chantre
gives a list of the laboratories and public collections in Italy relating to
man. (1887, 165-165.)

There are already a number of excellent guide-books for investiga-
tors, but Dr. Emil Schmidt added one more, entitled Anthropologische
Methoden, Anleitung zum Beobachten und Sammeln fiir Laboratorium
und Reise. (Leipzig (1888). 333 p., figs., 8vo.)

BIOLOGY OF MAN.-

Progress in human biology has been along many lines. The one most
persistently followed is that supposed to lead to the source of the species.
In the method of man’s appearance on earth there are two sets of phe-
nomena to be distinguished, the establishment of the fact of his origin
and the proper answer to the question, How did this fact come to be. M.
Topinard well states the latter case in the following words: There are
two general processes of evolution, the one by the transfiguration of
species, according to Broca, the other by transformation, according to
Darwin. Darvwin’s method is by natural selection, Lamarck’s method is
by adaptation to external circumstances of an organism stimulated by
internal needs.

The Précis danthropologie of Hovelacque and Hervé gives a fresh
impetus to the polygenic theory of man’s origin. The evolution theory
is accepted, but men were evolved in more than one center and from
more than one pair. This revived the suggestion made some years ago
of two races of men originating at the north and the south-pole, respect-
ively. The polygenic origin of our race is also advocated in M, Debierre’s
ANTHROPOLOGY. 5O1

L’Homme avant l’ Histoire. Following up Professor Flower’s attempt
to summon the teeth as a witness to the various types of mankind, Dr.
Fauvelle employs the dental system to teach the ancestral origin of our
race. Indeed, there needs to be stated only the titles of a few important
papers to show the many gates through which anthropogenists hope to
enter the successful answer. Such, for instance, are ‘*‘ The morphological
place of man in the mammalian series,” by Paul Albrecht; ‘¢ The origin,
races, and antiquity of man,” by B. Platz; ‘‘A new theory of heredity,”.
by C. Weigert; “The latest phases of heredity,” by A. M. Selling ; “Can
the existence of a tendency to change in the form of the skeleton of the
parent result in the actuality of that change in the offspring,” by W.
Arbuthnot Lane; ‘“* The modern theories of generation and heredity,”
by HE. G. Balbiani; ‘‘ The heredity of crime, alcoholism, ete.,” by G. Al-
geri; ‘“‘The history of transformism,” by A. Giard ; ‘Origin of the fit-
test,” by E. D. Cope; “ Evolution and creation,” by J. H. Hardwicke;
‘Lessons upon man according to the doctrine of evolution.” But the
most useful treatise upon this point is that of Dr. Topinard, the lecture
of March 21, 1888, before L’Kcole d’anthropologie, entitled, Les derniéres
étapes de la genealogie de l’Homme, and published in Revue @anthro-
pologie in the month of May in the same year.

In Nature (XXXVI, 268; 341) is reviewed one of the most thought in-
spiring works that have come within our notice during the two years
under consideration, Mr. G. J. Romaine’s paper before the Linnzan So-
ciety (see also Nineteenth Century, No. CXxIx, 1887, 59-80) on physiolog-
ical selection. The author is entirely in harmony with Mr. Darwin
about the intent and extent of natural selection as the preserver of
forms, but looks to other causes to create the variations to be selected
and conserved. “If,” says he, “ variation should be such that while
showing some degree of sterility with the parent form, it continues to
be as fertile as before within the limits of the varietal form, it would
neither be swamped by intercrossing nor die out on account of sterility.”
In human evolution of varieties there have been going on exactly such
excluding forces, shutting off to inbreeding color, clan, caste, nation-
ality, religion, and the like. A paper read by Dr. Burnett before the
Washington Anthropological Society on the Melungeons in the south-
ern Alleghanies is a case in point. Neither white nor black nor Indi-
ans, these people live encysted, like the Basques of the Pyrenees and
little contaminated by mixture.

One of the first convictions of the elder anthropologists of the last
century was that man comes within the domain of scientific considera-
tion only so fast as we can apply to him processes of counting, weigh-
ing, and tabulation. The progress of anthropometry has been along
the lines of refined apparatus and the subjecting of new parts of the
body to the metric processes. Anthropometry applied to the living
also to a large extent replaces the measuring of the skeleton. Rate of
growth, stature, size, weight, proportion, vigor, strength of muscle and
502 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR: 1887 AND 1888.

breathing, personal ideutity, these are the subjects of measures innu-
merable. Professor Hitchcock, of Amherst College, has published an
anthropometric manual giving the average and physical measurements
and tests of male college students and methods of securing them, pre-
pared from the records of the department of physical education and
hygiene in Amherst College in the years 188182 and 1886~’87 inelu-
Sive.

Mr. Francis Galton describes an anthropometric laboratory as a place
where a person may have any of his various faculties measured in the
best possible way at a small cost, and where duplicates of his measure-
ments may be preserved as private documents for his own future use
and reference. Such an institution would contain apparatus both of
the simpler kind used for weighings and measurings and for determina-
tions of chest capacity, muscular strength, and swiftness, and that of a
more delicate description used in what is technically called psycho-
physical research, for determining the efficiency of each of the various
senses and certain mental constants. Instruction might be afforded to
those who wished to make measurements at home, together with infor-
mation about instruments and the registration of results. An attached
library would contain works relating to the respective influences of he-
redity and nurture. These would inelude statistical, medical, hygienic,
and other memoirs in various languages, that are now either scattered
through our different scientific libraries or do not exist in any of them.
Duplicates of the measurement but without the names attached would
form a growing mass of material accessible to statisticians.

From conversation with friends Mr. Galton gathers that the library
might fulfill a weleome purpose in becoming a receptacle for biogra-
phies and family records, which would be in two classes, the one to be
preserved as private documents accessible only to persons authorized
by the depositor, and the other as ordinary books, whether they were
in manuscript or in print. (Nature, 1887, 112.) In addition to Galton’s
catalogue of apparatus, Fisher, Venn, Bloxam, and Sargent have pub-
lished lists of apparatus, with directions.

The philosophical instrument makers publish catalogues of anthro-
pometric apparatus. These are applied to new sets of phenomena every
year. Among the notable publications in this direction are Galton’s
paper on the head-growth of students at Cambridge; the weight of new-
born children, by Farago; relation of the hand to stature in Asiatics,
by Mugnier; reports on laboratory work, by Bloxam and Garson; an-
thropometric data based on the measurement of three thousand stu-
dents, by Tuckerman; child-growth, by Zelenski, Lansberger, Chaille,
Lorey, Tetherston, and Stephenson.

Cooérdinated with cranial measurements are cephalic measurements.
Ever since Broca’s day earnest efforts have been made to perfect this
coordination. On the cephalic measurements in France have appeared
Collignon’s charts of the repartition of the index; C. Arbo has studied
ANTHROPOLOGY. 508

the same question in Norway, and A. Fallot publishes a note upon the
index of the Proveneals.

With reference to the external characteristics of the human body,
none attracts so much attention as color of the Skin, hair, and eyes.
Both in Germany and in France commissions have been appointed by
the Government to report on thiS subject. In certain lines of investi-
gation this must lead to excellent results. Admitting that all varia-
tions in our species are the composite result of a struggle between the
environment and the species, it is incontrovertible that these changes
will take place more rapidly at those points where the battle rages most
fiercely, at the most exposed points, where sunlight and heat and actin-
ism, where humidity and aridity, heat and cold, and the like have made
their fiercest attacks upon us. The most eminent anthropologists have
not been unmindful of this. DeCandolle, Pommerol, Hansen, Variot,
Flinker, and Topinard, in many papers, have brought together the re-
sults of the public inquiries and pointed ont the way to better methods.

Longevity is the subject of several publications that have appeared.
There are several factors which enter into the count of race vitality,
namely, fecundity, longevity, and energy or vigor, both bodily and
mental. There are vague accounts of long-lived individuals, but it is
only recently that means have been adopted for verifying the state-
ment as regards individuals and for reaching definite conclusions re-
specting the life periods of races, communities, or peoples.

M. Turquan and M. Tissandier have collected the Statistics of macro-
bians. Signor Corradi and Signor Trussardi have written treatises on
longevity in relation to history, to anthropology and hygiene. Other
papers on the same subject have appeared by Ornstein, Humphrey, and
Ledyard. On the subject of vigor Signor Zoja has investigated methods
of measuring the muscular force of various races.

Further researches in this same line are the study of chest types in
man, the Mongolian eye, physiognomie, prehension, right-handedness,
erectness of posture, the senses of savages, bodily size and stature, vital
Statistics, the preservation of vigor, weight, hairiness, and baldness.

There is a mooted question concerning the relative advantage of sav-
agery and civilization as regards vitality. On May 24,-1888, George
Harley read an essay before the London Anthropological Institute on
the relative recuperative powers of man living in a rude, and man living
in a highly civilized, state, in which he brought forward a number of
hitherto unpublished though mostly well-known facts, demonstrating
that the refining influence of civilization had not been altogether the un-
alloyed boon we so fondly imagine it to have been. For the cases cited
went far to demonstrate the fact that while man’s physique as well as
his mental power had increased during his evolution from a barbaric
State into a condition of bienseance, his recuperative capacity, on the
other hand, has materially deteriorated. In fact, it appears from the ex-
amples cited that every appliance adding to man’s bodily comfort as
,

504 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

well as every contrivance either stimulating or developing his mental
faculties, while increasing his personal enjoyment, materially diminishes
his animal vitality, rendering him less able to resist the effects of lethal
bodily injuries, or recover from them as well and as quickly as his bar-
barie ancestors, or his less-favored brethren. (Nature, 1887, p. 143.)

The body in disease as well as in health may be interrogated about
the origin of man and the methods of his physical history. Dr. Mat-
thews writes about diseases among our Indians; Max Bartels upon the
rate of healing; McKee and Tecce upon the results of cousin marriages.
In the same direction are the studies of abnormal forms, monstrosities,
such as microcephals, maternal impressions upon the offspring, platy-
cnemism, pygmies, splanchnology, tailed men, the defective classes, su-
pernumerary organs.

This leads us to the anatomy of the cadaver and the examination of
exhumed skeletons. The pelvis, the thorax, the long bones of the arm
and of the leg, the scapula, the teeth, and other parts of the mouth,
the nose, the orbit, have all been thoroughly studied by Rollet, Fau-
velle, Collignon, Bertillon, Giacomini, Prochownick, Runge, Manou-
vrier, Dwight, Ribbe, Pohlman, Harderup, Riccardi, Testut, Matthews,
Beddoe, and Daubes. Upon these studies it is proposed to build a cor-
rect account of our racial history and of our origin.

But the great mass of anthropological anatomists still expend their
labor upon the skull and the brain, separately and in relation to each
other. Under cranial measurements and cranial indices consult the
papers of A. B. Meyer, Sergi and Moschen, Sanson, Emil Schmidt, J.
G. Garson, O. Fraenkel, Legge, Mies, Dight, Laloy and Benedikt, Topi-
nard and Shufeldt.. Upon the evolution of the brain, its mass, its con-
volutions, its intimate and comparative structure and functions we have
to consult the papers of Pozzi, Simms, Topinard, Fauvelle, Manouvrier,
Hervé, Bechteren, Benedikt, Rolleston, Sergi, Houzé, Collignon, Arbo,
Fallot, and Luys.

In this same connection the question of topography in the brain and
cranio-cerebral topography have been discussed by Dr. Cunningham,
of the Royal Irish Academy, by Dr. 8S. Brown, and by Dr. Bonnafort.

To follow up this wide subject with any degree of thoroughness the
reader must consult carefully Archiv fiir Anthropologie and Revue
d’Anthropologie. The Index Medicusand the Index-Catalogue of the
Surgeon-General’s Library leave nothing to be desired in the biblio-
graphy of human biology in the widest acceptation of the term, and
relieve this summary from repeating a long list of biological journals.

PSYCHOLOGY.

Following closely after biology and entangled with it beyond hope of
extrication is the modern psychology, which within its proper area in-
cludes many investigations into the origin of mind, the study of animal
intelligence, of the faculties of the mind, of the diseases, abnormalities,
ANTHROPOLOGY. 505

and idiosynerasies of mind, of unusual states of mind exhibited in
ecstasy, hypnotism, and mind reading ; psychophysies and the physical
substratum of mental operations, and various other recondite problems
not amenable to classification.

The first series of investigation to consider relates to what Madame
Clemence Royer calls L’evolution mentale dans la sérié organique. It has
at present a speculative rather than a practical manifestation. But the
inquiry about the Unseen from which our spirits come and to which
they return continues to excite the pens of such philosophers as Huxley,
Gladstone, Du Bois-Reymond, Virchow, and Quatrefages.

A more practical form of investigation is that which treats mentality
as a branch of nature with its individual growths from the egg, in its
genera and species, relation to environment, and so forth. And so we
follow with pleasure and without embarrassment M. Pietrement in his
study of hunting dogs, Romanes in his matchless studies in the intelli-
gence of animals. Sir John Lubbock long ago conducted important in-
vestigations along the same line, and the studies of Professor Cooke
are still fresh in our memories. The most interesting query started by
Lubbock inquires into the existence of other organs of sense than ours.
The natural history of intelligence, by which is meant the attempt to
apply the study of origin, growth, development, chorology, ete., to
mental processes has received great encouragement from the observa-
tion of animals. In our own country George and Elizabeth Peckham
have experimented on spiders and wasps, and in England Sir John Lub-
bock published a volume on the senses, instincts, and intelligence of
animals, with special reference to insects.

The genius of the investigation may be apprehended in the following
paragraph :

‘* We find in animals complex organs of sense, richly supplied with
nerves, but the function of which we are as yet powerless to explain.
There may be fifty other senses as different from ours as sound is from
sight, and even within the boundaries of our own senses there may be
endless sounds which we can not hear, and colors as different as red
from green, of which we have no conception. These and a thousand
other questions remain for solution. The familiar world which sur-
rounds us may be a totally different place to other animals. To them
it may be full of music which we can not hear, of sensations we can not
conceive. ‘To place stuffed birds and beasts in glass cases, to arrange
insects in cabinets and dried plants in drawers, is merely the drudgery
and preliminary of study ; to watch their habits, to understand their re-
lations to one another, to study their instincts and intelligence, to as-
certain their adaptations and their relations to the forces of nature, to
realize what the world appears to them; these constitute, as it seems
to me, at least, the true interests of natural history, and may even give
us the clue to senses and perceptions of which at present we have no
conception.”
506 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

The faculties of the mind are studied in the same manner as the mind
itself. The phenomena of consciousness and unconsciousness, of sensa-
tion, of perception and apperception; of instinct, memory, emotion, rea-
son, and volition in healthy exercise are taken up as so many rocks, or
plants, or animals, and their natural history scrutinized. And this is
true regardless of the metaphysical basis of the study; the most pro-
nounced materialists and spiritualists have caught the inspiring motive
of the naturalist. In this line reference may be made to Wilbrand,
Osterman, James, McCosh, Bowne, Dewey, Ladd, Burnham, Féré,
Fouilleé, Scholz, Nelson, Hall, and writers in Mind and other journals
of psychology.

Just as some of the richest results in mineralogy have been realized
from the study of allotropism, in botany and zoology from abnormaili-
ties, so in mind study the utmost diligence is exercised in observing the
phenomena of mental deformities and eccentricities. In the first num-
ber of the American Journal of Psychology, William Noyes discusses
paranoia. Further researches in the same line are Routh on overwork
and premature mental decay, G. H. Savage on homicidal mania, Gris-
som on the liistory and poetry of insanity, Tenchini on the brains of
delinquents, Foy on idiosynerasies, Stevenson on genius and mental
disease, and Duval, Ploix, and Dally on aphasia. Indeed, both in
France and Italy, congresses, societies, and journals are devoted to
this side of anthropological research.

The scientific psychologist has pursued his researches still further.
There have been hanging around the suburbs of knowledge many de-
scendants of aboriginal philosophy. One of these offspring is belief in
the possibility of occult contact with the spirits of men and a spirit
world of the dead. This whole subject, to study which the English So-
ciety for Psychical Research was organized, is ably reviewed by Prof.
Stanley Hall in the first number of the American Journal of Psychology
(128-146). He says: “Thus far not only the formation of such a soci-
ety, but the boldness of its plan, with its committees on apparitions and
haunted houses, and onthe claims of Mesmer and Reichenbach, and the
degree to which the difficulties and the dangers of the proposed inves-
tigations were realized, were all such as to commend it not only to every
psychologist, but to every true and inteliigent friend of culture and re-
ligion. While those who regard the baser forms of modern spiritualism
as the refined and concentrated embodiment of all the superstitions of
a remote and barbarous past, and the claims of those who pretend to
mediate between the living and their friends who are dead as a name-
less crime against the most sacred things of the soul, must feel a deep
interest in such work, there is another class, perhaps still larger, and
with an interest still deeper. This class consists of those who, in these
days of unsettlement in religious beiiefs, hope to find amid superabun-
dant aberglaube a nucleus of certainty for at least the doctrine of immor-
tality. The most absolute idealists are not so satisfied with the specu-
ANTHROPOLOGY. 507

lative method which works by exhausting thought possibilities as not
to welcome the most empirical refutation of materialism and mechanism.
Even Mr. Meyer’s “ phantasmagoric efficacy,” his ‘telepathic percola-
tion,” or veritable ghosts of those dying or dead or even in great dan-
ger, are not unwarrantable in establishing his “solidarity of life which
idealism proclaims,” or “the universal mind in which all minds are
one.” But the impartiality attainable in most fields of scientific research
is impossible here. A rigorously unbiassed and yet an intelligent jury,
could probably not be found in this country or in England, so many and
subtle and remotely ancestral are the conscious, and far more the uncon-
scious, prepossessions which enter like Schopenhauer’s primacy of the
will, making us all lynx-eyed to all that favors one side and bat-eyed for
all that favors the other. It is this inexpungable bias, evolved from a
state of savage superstition, which enters into our judgment and pre-
vents a just critical estimate of evidence. Gurney’s phantasms of the
living, Sinnett’s hypnotism in the Orient, Herter’s discussion of the
nature of hypnotism, such are the works that are constantly appearing
upon this corner of anthropology.

Psychology is now clearly within the area of anthropology, having
its laboratories and instruments of precision, its systematic experiments
and its organized corps of observation. Prof. G. Stanly Hall says,
‘¢ Several departments of science have touched and enriched psychology,
bringing to it their best methods and their clearest insights.” Among
those whose studies have contributed to this end are teachers of psy-
chology in higher institutions of learning, biologists and physiologists ;
anthropologists who are interested in primitive manifestations of psy-
chological laws; physicians who give special attention to mental and
nervous diseases ; men who, like Mr. Galton, have applied more exact
methods to the problem of human feelings, will, and thought.

The establishment in our country of a journal devoted solely to
psycho-physies is a noteworthy event, and the fact that Prof. G. Stanley
Hall will have charge of the American Journal of Psychology is a suf-
ficient guaranty of its great scientific value.

In the first number of this publication Dr. Lombard and Professor
Jastrow both explain with great clearness the psycho-physice law and
jllustrate its operation. Professor Jastrow, in his paper on star magni-
tudes, very clearly explains the action of the psycho-physical law in the
first number of the American Journal by referring to Bernouille’s illus-
tration of the distinction between the value and theemolument of money.
The emolument, or pleasure-giving power, of an additional sum of money
is shown to be the logarithm of the wealth of an individual. By widen-
ing the conception of the wealth to the general one of a physical stim-
ulus of any kind, and putting sensation in general for the particular
sensation caused by an increase in money, we have the psycho-physic
law. For the particular illustration of this law Professor Jastrow com-
508 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND i888.

pares the star magnitudes as they have been arranged by means of the
eye with the results of mechanical photometers.

Some interesting experiments on the reciprocal influence of organs of
sense have been recently made by Herr Urbanschitsch, of Vienna. His
general conclusion is that any sense-excitation has for result an increase
of acuteness of other senses. Thus sensations of hearing sharpen the
visual perceptions. If colored plates are placed at such a distance that
one can hardly distinguish the colors, and various sounds are then pro-
duced, the colors become generally more distinct the higher the sounds.
Similarly, one can, while a sound affects the ear, read words which one
could not read before. Again, the ticking of a watch is better heard
when the eyes are open than when they are closed. Red and green in-
crease auditive perceptions, but blue and yellow weaken them. Several
musicians, however, were agreed that red, green, and yellow and blue
caused an intensification of sound about one-eighth ; while violet had a
weakening effect. Taste, smell, and touch are under like laws. Light
and red and green colors increase their delicacy ; while darkness, blue
and yellow diminish it. Under the influence of red and green, taste
extends from the anterior border of the tongue to the whole surface.
On the other hand, a strengthening of smell, taste, or touch exalts the
other sensitive perceptions. Specially interesting is the reciprocal in-
fluence of touch and the sense of temperature. If one tickle the skin
with a hair and plunge the hand in hot water the tickling sensation
ceases ; on the contrary, if the hand be placed in cold water and a part
of the body tickled the temperature is felt more vividly. Herr Urban-
schitsch finds in this reciprocal action an explanation of supposed
double consecutive sensations on excitation of one sense. (Nature, 1887,
De L57.)

The two sources of information which are absolutely indispensable to
the studentof psycho-physices are Wundt’s ““Physiologische Psychologie”
and “ Hall’s American Journal of Psychology.” In addition to these
“ Mind,” “ Brain,” ‘‘ Philosophische Studien” and “ Pfliiger’s Archiv” are
to be consulted. In our own country we have at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, in Professor Cattell’s laboratory, in Philadelphia, in the Army Medi-
cal Museum at Washington, apparatus for psycho-physical experiments.
Works of eminent authority in this line of research must be sought
under the names, Cattell, Cowles, Donaldson, Fauvelle, Galton, Hall,
Hodge. Hyslop, Jackson, Jastrow, Kénig, Lombroso, Krauss, Kroner,
Ladd, Lombard, Thompson, Vigna, Wolfe, and Wundt.

In the study of mind many subsidiary and leading questions arise not
included in any of the classes above noticed. Such would be the pa-
per of G. J. Romanes on the mental differences of men and women, of
Mantegazza, on psychic atavism, of Nicolas, upon automatism in volun-
tary actions, and that most interesting discussion in Nature by Max
M iiller, Francis Galton, H. S. Wortley, H. Picton, G. J. Romanes, and
J. J. Murphy (xXxvVI, 28, 100, 101, 124, 125, 171, 172, 249), upon the pos

sibility of thoughts without words. The same question was raised some
years ago in the Anthropological Society of Washington, by Protessor
Porter, of the Deaf Mute College. This correspondence is all printed
as an appendix to “Three introductory lectures on the science of
thought” by Max Miiller. (London, 1888, 8vo.)

ETHNOLOGY.

What was previously said of psychology may be repeated concerning
ethnology ; it is at bottom a biological science. That is, when we say
race” we ought to mean blood, not language, nor nationality, nor a
region of country, certainly not arts or institutions.

Itis truethat the science includes all about a certain breed or stock of
mankind; indeed, it is the anthropalogy of men taken by breeds, The
ethnologist and the ethnographer are biologists to start with, but they
cover the entire area of the natural history of man. The latter works
out the anthropology of a single stock or breed. The latter is concerned
with anthropology arranged with blood or consanguineous groups for
his primary concept. Strictly speaking we apply the term ethnogra-
pher to a student of a nation or any other agglommeration of human
beings, but this ought not so to Le.

As the first question in anthropology is the origin of man so the first
question in ethnology is the origin and boundaries of races. Thesearch
for primitive man, therefore, is at the same time thesearch for primitive
men.

The second inquiry, which trenches on archeology, and is indeed the
motive of the archeologist’s researches, is what races of inen have lived
on the earth and what may be the relation of the present races to them.
Upon this question M. de Quatrefages and Marquis de Nadaillac are our
chief authorities ; while for general treatises on the species at large the
reader must consult Snell, Kriegel, Achelis, Maladini, Robert Brown,
Featherman, and various translations and adaptations of Von Hellwald.
The seventh volume of the Standard Natural History is reprinted with
an appendix which very much adds to its value. Prof. A. H. Keane in
his published classifications and in his reviews in Nature continues to
be the best English authority on general ethnology.

The biological inquiry into color of hair, eyes, and skin, into pilosity
and other anthropometric characteristics is mainly with reference to the
subject of race.

In the Journal of the Anthropological Institute (XVI, 370-379) Mr. R.
S. Poole shows the Egyptian classification of the races of man.

The question of racial healing or medical ethnography is considered
by Tiffany and Verrier.

In allanthropological journals will be found more or less ethnography.
In Paris is published Revue WVEthnographie. The Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society of London isa rich mine of information, and a complete
index of all its volumes will be found at the close of the volume for 1888,

One of the most celebrated feats of reconstructing the civilization of

ancient nations is the history of the discovery of Hittites.

In January,
ANTHROPOLOGY. 511

1888, Mr. Thomas Tyler delivered a course of lectures upon this people
in the British Museum,

A few years ago all we knew of the Hittites was contained in a few
vague references in the First and Second Book of Kings. In the true
sense of the word empire, it is doubtful whether a Hittite empire ever
existed. Says Mr. Tyler: ‘* Most likely there were in Asia Minor many
states or even single cities which were usually to a great extent inde-
pendent, and the peoples of which were not, perhaps, altogether homo-
geneous in race, but which, under pressure of the necessity of war,
formed a federation. That the Hittites spoken of in the Old Testament
are to be identified with the Khita of the Egyptian monuments and
with the peoples of the land of Khatti in the Assyrian records, is com-
ing out more and more clearly.”

The primitive home of the Aryans seems now to be less definitely
fixed than formerly. The studies of Pott, Lassen, and Max Miiller
made the highlands of Asia to be the cradle of the Aryans. Dr. La-
tham, even at that time, urged that the Asiatic hypothesis was mere
assumption based on no shadow of proof. Recently the European
theory has been entertained by Gugei, Cuno, Peuka, and Sehrader.

The commingling of blood, language, social organization, beliefs, and
activities in the Malayan area is elucidated by Dr. Fridrich’s paper in
the miscellany relating to Indo China. He noticed the continued exist-
ence of Hindooism in Java and other parts of Malaysia, and says that it
is essential to a proper understanding of the condition of the Malayan
tribes that the influence which Hindoo civilization has exerted on them
should be investigated.

At a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Japan, reported in the Japan
Weekly Mail of November 19, Mr. Batchelor read a paper on Kamui
or Gods of the Ainos. The author is not convinced that the Ainos are
dying out.

LANGUAGE.

By many anthropologists language is placed among the biological
sciences. Such liberties with the term, however, would corsign the
whole study of man to the realm of biology. In reality the true start-
ing point of anthropology is the study of invention, the consideration
of all those devices, institutions, ways and means through which our
race has made its progressive journey.

Among the inventions or institutions that lie at the foundation of
culture, the most universal in time and place is language, or devices for
the communication of thought.

The science of glossology is the anthropology or natural history of
speech. It therefore is concerned with origins, with classifications,
with life histories, with variation uider stress, with as many questions
as would be asked about plants or animals.

Indeed, the very first problem that confronts us is this: How far have
the animals anticipated us in speech; to what extent have they been
our teachers, and what suggestions of their activities and natural qual-
ities have helped in forming the vocabularies of the world.

Close on the heels of this inquiry comes the subject of gesture-lan-
guage, to the study of which Col. Garrick Mallery has devoted so many
years of patient research. The result of his labors, with references to
further authorities, are to be found in the publications of the Bureau of
Ethnology.

Upon the biological side have appeared such works as Handman
upon the human voice and language in physiological psychology, Loew-
enberg’s physiological researches on nasal vowels, Marique upon the
ANTHROPOLOGY. 513

larynx, organ of phonation, in its relations with the cerebral centers of
language and ideation, Aranjo on the metamorphoses of a sound, Bell’s
university lectures on phonetics, Jacobi on the special liability to the
loss of nouns in aphasia, Horatio Hale on the development of language.
The Index-Medicus should be faithfully consulted for papers on the
anatomy, abnormalities, diseases, and peculiarities of the vocal organs.

Other productions of general interest are Tregear’s ancient alphabets,
Newell on the color of words, Brinton on the language of palaeolithic
man, Stevenson on place names, Horatio Hale on the development of
language.

In this connection reference is again made to the controversy in Na-
ture originated by Max Miiller, concerning the dependence of reason
upon speech.

The study of anindividual language may be termed glossography, just
as the study of a separate people is styled ethnography. The two, in-
deed, are often confounded. If language and race were conterminous
a list of all the languages of the world would be at the same timea list
of all the peoples or breeds of mankind. Just so far as they are not con-
terminous is confusion introduced into the enumerations of the lan-
guages of the different continents. The complaint is made by critics
of great lists, such as Cust’s for Africa and Polynesia, that this or that
term is not of a language, but of a government.

Moreover, the author who writes about a people generally includes
a chapter on their language. It is safe, therefore, for the glossologist
to look carefully over the ethnographic titles for material. Further-
more, the accompanying list of works that have been noticed will be
useful.

entire literature of North American aboriginal languages will leave
nothing further to be desired. The original plan of including all works
under a single aphabetical list has been abandoned, and the author
takes up each of the stocks separately. Two monographs have ap-
peared in the uew series, *‘ Bibliography of the Eskimo Language” and
‘¢ Bibliography of the Siouan Language.” both issued by the Bureau of
Ethnology and printed at the Government Printing Office. Each of
the other stocks will receive similar treatment. When the work shall
be completed it will leave nothing to desire as a pointer to all sources
of information on America.

tioned under general anthropology, must be the authorities on glossology.

TECHNOLOGY.

The arts of mankind are the material on which to base the natural
history of invention. Each art has had its humble birth and has grown
to maturity by the constant increase of complexity. The process of in-
venting itself has had an organic growth, commencing with what might
be called an unicellular process and ending with a most complicated set
of co-ordinated actions, as numerous and intricate as the parts of the
human body. Between a childish or a savage acting on suggestion, a
no-sooner-said-than-done performance, and the inventing of the Bell
telephone, with all the thinking, experimenting, petitioning, pleading,
correspondence, examination, and litigation involved is a very long
way. Between the two lie all human mental activities, growing more
and more complex as we proceed.

Anthropology is concerned with every human activity and industry,
for the purpose of obtaining their testimony to human history. The
history of man and of his mind are indeed more clearly written in things
than in words.

There are two or three distinct ways of treating technological mate.
rial, based on the order of the ruling concepts, art, race, region. A
study might be governed by certain groups of arts for the prineipal con-
cept, as in all Mr. E. B. Tylor’s writings; or by certain regions of the
ANTHROPOLOGY. 515

globe, where the conditions are unique, as in the writings of A. Bastian;
or we could study out the industries of a race, a nation, a sect, wher-
ever in timeor place they may have lived.

One of the most profitable series of investigations into the origin of
form and decoration in the arts is a series of papers by W. H. Holmes,
published by the Bureau of Ethnology. Mr. Holmes finds a little frag-
ment of pottery in the fields around Washington. This tells him that
the aborigines knew the ceramic art. By pressing on the surface a
piece of artist’s clay he gets the impress of woven texture. This tells
that these aborigines were weavers, and it is very easy to see what kind
of weavers they were. It also tells how they decorated pottery. This,
by piecing art to art, fragment to fragment, the author is able to recon-
struct the daily life of an extinct people; to ascertain how the invent-
ive faculty has caught up one suggestion of dame nature after another,
and then technic laziness has reduced the full form to conventionalisms
and abbreviations. Herr Schaaffhausen has caught up the same idea
and published “ Entwickelung des menschlichen Handwerks und den
Kinfluss des Stoffes auf die Kunstform.”

Next tothe subject of invention and the stimulus thereto by means
of patents the subject of learning a trade, of industrial training,
demands the careful study of the anthropologists. It is easy to follow
up the methods of our own day, but our chief inquiry is how things
came to be as they are. Such papers as that of G. P. Morris on indus-
trial training two centuries ago will be hailed with pleasure by com-
parative technologists.

The only way to illustrate and to study this branch of anthropology
is by means of the museum, the gallery or cabinet of drawings, and the
specifications. If one would follow up an art he must collect material,
he must supply himself with many pictures, he must have his card eat-
alogue or files of ready reference, and all these must be movable and
interchangeable.

In the U. S. National Museum there are many series of objects in-
stalled to show the natural history of invention, such as naval archi-
tecture, land transportation, fishing, music, pottery, cutlery, weapons.
These are of especial interest to craftsmen, who find no difficulty in
reading the history of their daily occupations.

It 1s not necessary to enumerate the names of all the arts abont which
books have been written in 1887-88. <A glance at the list of titles
proves that some one has been fascinated with nearly every occupation
of mankind. The unit chapter on this subject, the technographic unit
is an art of a people. If these be well written they may be allowed to
tell their story in two directions, either as a part of the whole history
of a people or as a part of the whole history of an art. If Mr. Sato has
written a work on Japanese farming, it may be filed away under farm-
ing or under Japanese, according to the ruling motive in the mind of the

ARCH ASOLOGY.

Leaving the question of anthropogeny to the biologists the archzeolo-
gist will still be concerned with primitive man. He desires to know
Where our race made its début on this planet, how long ago it was, and
what was the intellectual and material stock in trade of that first man.

For the study of what M. Collignon calls homme avant )’ Histoire
there is constantly collecting fresh material.

The geologist and the paleontologist are the first to take the stand.
Mr. W J McGee, of the U. 8. Geological Survey, whose especial de-
partment is the quaternary period, has addressed himself to the strati-
graphic question, while the paleontology has been discussed by Mar-
cellin Boule, and the cotemporaneity of the mammoth and man by J.
M. Clarke and H. Howorth, MM. de Puydt and Lohest.

On the subject of the antiquity of man we have a paper by L. Guig-
nard, relating to France; by A. R. Wallace, on the antiquity of man in
America; by E. Riviere, on the antiquity of man in the Alps.

There has been a question agitated between geologists, paleontolo-
gists, and archeologists whether in cave and other explorations we are
to regard the form and finish of implements, the associated animal
remains, or the condition of the strata, to be the best guide to a knowl-
edge of the age of the deposit. The case has been pretty thoroughly
reviewed by Henry Hicks and Worthington G. Smith. (Nature, XxXxvII
105, 129, 202.)

A fresh classification of archeology is marked by the appearance in
England of a new journal, the Archeological Review. The range and
divisions of the subjects are: (1) Institutional archeology, which ex-
tends the domain of archeology into that of sociology. Indeed, every
branch of anthropology may thus have its archeology. (2) Anthropo-
logical archeology. Thisisabad title. It is meant to include biological
and technological subjects, the remains of man and of his arts. (3)
Folk-lore. The society would inelude in this the origin of language, all
kinds of tales, rhymes, myths, and lore, and the beginnings of philoso-
phy. (4) Literature; that is, the oidest literatures. The society has
promised to do one good thing, for which, well done, they will receive
the gratitude of allstudents. They will index all English archeological
publications prior to 1886 and current English and foreign archeologi-
cal periodicals, and will issue special indexes to different branches of
archeological research,

The British Association for the Advancement of Science has regulay

standing committees on prehistoric remains and the preservation ot
ancient monuments. The former committee has been busy in mapping
and describing all the monuments of the country; the latter in peti-
tioning both Parliament and the local proprietors to preserve the most
celebrated remains. <A brief of the reports will be found in Nature,
XXXVII, 93, 94.

The same is also true in France and Germany. Movements are on
foot for the cataloguing of all museums, for the systematic and co-op-
erative survey of remains and the preservation of such monuments as
have historic interest.

The Royal Academy of Sciences in Austria has appointed a prehis-
toric commission, which has already issued its first report. Ln our
own country the subject of archeology is also receiving a systematic
treatment. Fortunately for the final result the two principal institu-
tious engaged in extended work are pursuing different methods.

Prof. Cyrus Thomas, of the Bureau of Ethnology, commences with a
census of all the mounds, earth-works, and other aboriginal remains in
the United States. In the Ohio Archeological and Historical Quar-
terly Mrs. Thomas presents a bibliography on this subject, but the plan
of the Bureau has been more extended than this. The whole area has
a card catalogue, by means of which it is possible to construct maps of
large or smail spaces and to exhibit the number and distribution of
each class. The most valuable portion of Professor Thomas’ task, and
that which exhibits the great advantage of combined labor, is that he
is able to work by the side of another staff of men who are studying the
distribution of Indians over this continent at the time when they were
first visited by white men. Laying the map of the distribution of lin-
guistic stocks on the top of his own map of the mounds, and so forth,
he has a starting point for deciding who were the Mound-builders.

The Peabody Museum, or, strictly speaking, its curator, Professor
Putnam, educated in comparative anatomy under the elder Agassiz, has
addressed himself to another problem, namely, the careful dissection of
graves, mounds, and remains so as to know exactly how they were con-
structed, what relics are deposited in them, and what modern modes
of burial they most resemble. Of course, the final result will be reached
by combining the two investigations.

It is impossible to mention the names of authors who have reported
special researches in archeology.

To follow the subject abroad it is only necessary to study the English
Archeological Review, Antiqua, the French. Materiaux pour I’Historie
de ’Homme, and the bibliographical appendix to the Archiv fiir An-
thropologie.

In our own country the annual reports of the Peabody Museum, the
reports of the Archeological Institute of America and its ally the
American Journal of Archeology, the American Antiquarian, Proceed-
ings of the American Antiquarian Society, the reports of the Smithso-
518 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

nian Institution and of the Bureau of Ethnology, the American Anthro-
pologist, the Ohio Archeological and Historical Journal, Anales del
Museo Nacional de Mexico, and the proceedings of a few State and
local societies give publicity to about all that is worthy of permanent
record.

SOCIOLOGY.

Sociology is the natural history of society, and studies the formation
and growth of human compacts that have survived and become varie-
ties or species. It also investigates the life history of societies, their
customs and principles.

To repeat the titles of all sociological papers that appeared in 1887~88
would require a space equal to Pool’s Index to periodical literature. To
show the variety of topics and not to exhaust the subject, a list of
catch-words is given, with the authors to consult respecting each. It
may not always be the most eminent authority. Suffice it to say, the
subject has been of sufficient prominence-to arrest some one’s attention.

were not such as to favor the romantic passion even in Greece and
Rome. The highest expressions of sexual devotion are to be found in
the ancient literature of Semitic peoples. Mantegazza was the first to
write seriously upon the subject. Since his celebrated papers the litera-
ture hasrapidly multiplied. (Nature, xxxvit, 149.)

The part played by both love and beauty in social selection may be
studied in connection with Romanes on physiological selection. An-
other method of inquiry is to follow up the natural history of the pro-
cess of love-making from its simplest to its most complex forms.

Professor Huxley has said respecting the effect of modern civiliza-

the restraints imposed by civilization have altered the methods by
which the struggle for existence is carried on, they have not made it
less real or less bitter.” In other words, great enterprises and the re-
sults of world-compelling inventions are achieving great social victories
and defeats as influential as those wrought by decisive wars. Note the
influence on the trade of England and the Mediterranean, first, by the
voyage of Vasco da Gama, and second, by the Suez Canal. Parliamen-

520 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888

In every one of the journals devoted to the subject at large sociolog-
ical papers are published. Furthermore, the great Euglish quarterlies,
the North American Review, the Forum, even the monthlies, weeklies,
and dailies, are witness of the absorption of the public mind in this de-
partment of anthropology.

Like every other investigation, the attempt to study crime in a scien-
tific manner began with crude and false methods. For instance, the
comparison of states or nations based on arrests led to a positively in-
verted result; because in highly organized communities a great many
acts are considered to be crimival that are not noticed in worse com-
munities. Even in the case of prison statistics, General Walker says,
“The number of persons in prison on a given date affords a very delu-
sive measure of the comparative morality of different sections of the
country having different codes of laws and different social standards.
For instance, a very large part of the persons who are at any time in
prisons and jails in the State of Massachusetts, are there for drunken-
ness or for the illegal sale of liquors. In another State, the man who
sells liquor is a public benefactor. So far, then, the paucity of prison
lists simply represents the toleration of vice, if not of crime.”

The Italian criminologists were not slow to notice this and apply the
facts in rectifying deductions about heredity, atavism, primitive man,
and the descent of man, based on the anthropometry of arrested per-
sons and convictsin general. Ifa good but poor man die in a debtor’s
prison one would scarcely look for the promise of his misfortune in his
cranium. Even deductions based on special crimes, as theft or murder,
must not omit the history of the man on account of the times, the va-
rious external stimuli that have helped, perhaps forced, against his
will, the man to the action. This subject has been thought worthy of
a special world’s convention, which has published Actes du I congrés
internationale danthropologie criminelle in Rome, November, 1885,
and issued in Turin in 1887. The following mentioned works will also
help to the public interest and the variety of treatment which the sub-
ject has elicited.

Human criminality from the point of view of comparative anatomy :
Paul Albrecht. Atlas of criminality, the new anthropometry and
criminality, and bibliographie penitentiaire of different countries since
the beginning of the century: Luigi Anfosso. Criminal anthropology
in Corsica: A. Bournet. Degereration and criminality: Ch. Féré.
The thieves’ oracle in Java: G. Beyfuss. Thermometric variations and
criminality: E. Ferri. Theexternal ear,astudy in criminal anthropology:

pology: S. Gache. The penal code and frenopathology: J. Giné y
Partagas. Corporeal and mental peculiarities of criminals: von HOl-
der. Crime—a social study: Henri Joly. Criminal anthropology and
punishment: H. Kurella. The criminal in his anthropological, medical,
and judicial relations: Cesare Lombroso. Thecharacters of delinquents:
ANTHROPOLOGY. 521

A. Marro. Anatomical observations on the brains and skulls of erimi-
nals: G. Mingazzini. The actions of criminals: Pitré. The principle
of causation in criminal science: F. Puglia. Notes on crime and acci-
dents in Norfolk at the time of Edward I: W. Rye. Studies upon a
century of crime: V. Rossi. Criminology: M. Tarde. The frontal
crest in criminals: Tenchini. Criminal anthropology: Paul Topinard.
Creating criminals: Amos G. Warner. The essential elements which
should be present in criminal statistics and the means of rendering them
comparable: E. Younes.

Close on the heels of crime attends, the punishment, and the one has
had as varied a history as the other. Upon this subject has appeared
crucifixion in the ancient east by George Rawlinson. Judicial exe-
cutions: J. J. Z. Marshall. The prison world: E. Gautier. Genesis
and function of legal penalties: Angelo Vaccaro.

The police system of various countries and all the paraphernalia of
arrest should also find a place in this department of sociology.

Chinese civilization has a sympathizing exponent in the volume of M.
Simon. The most civilized state, according to this author, is that “ in
which on a given area, the largest possible number of human beings
are able to procure and distribute most equally amongst themselves the
mnost well-being, liberty, justice, and security.” Upon this scale China
is pronounced to be the most highly civilized country in the world.
“Its history shows the phenomena of heredity in regular succession,
neither modified nor obstructed by change of medium, with the evolu-
tion of events and ideas—an evolution as regular as that of living
beings freely proceeding unshaken and untroubled by any exterior in-
fluence, by which its direction might have been altered, or its develop-
ment retarded ; and it is here that we find the deep and original interest
of China, and perhaps also the secret of her extraordinary longevity.”

PHILOSOPHY, MYTHOLOGY, AND FOLK-LORE.

Among the lowest tribes of men all lore and myth is an attempt to
explain phenomena. This was long ago pointed out by Peschel. Amoug
the higher races we may study metaphysics, ethics, folk-lore, and re-
ligion as somewhat separate problems. Even here they are much in-
tertwined. The philosophy of living in this world has never been able
to disengage itself from a world beyond, a spirit world, acquainted with
ours, influencing it, and often believed to dominate over the life beyond.

For the purpose of scientific investigation, religion is here defined to
include the following topics:

(1) Social organization in view of the spirit world; in general terms,
the clergy and laity of a people. This we may eall the Church.

(2) The beliefs of a people about the spirit world embodied in their
sacred books, national epics, myths, and folk-lore. This we may call
the Creed.
522 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 18838.

(3) Conduct in view of the ecclesiastical organization. It ineludes
sacred precincts, edifices, regalia, paraphernalia of worship, fétes, pro-
cessions, selemn services, rites, sacrifices, holidays. In a single word,
it is the Cult of a people.

From this definition it will readily be seen that all religions may enter
the area of scientific inquiry, and, again, that it is very difficult to keep
philosophy, or the explanation of the universe, religion, or creed and
cult and folk-lore, which is the literature and custom of the unlettered,
apart in the laboratory.

It is an evidence of progress that there is in Paris a Musée des Re-
ligions, publishing Revue de l’ Histoire des Religions. In the sixteenth
volume of this periodical, Theodore Reinach has a paper on Les classifi-
cations des religious et la rdle de Histoire des religions dans Venseigne-
ment public. Julien Vinson has also in Revue de Linguistique (XxX1,
361-364) a paper entitled ‘ Les religions actuelles, leurs doctrines, leur
evolution, leur histoire.” Anthropological mythology also receives the
attention of B. Platner in the New Englander (1888), and the ghost
theory of the origin of religion is discussed in Bibliotheca Sacra for the
same year.

The whole subject of the basis of morality is being reviewed in’ the
most learned of our periodicals in America, in England, and on the con-
tinent. The North American Review, the Forum, the Contemporary
Review, the Nineteenth Century, the Revue Politique et Litteraire, the
Revue des deux Mondes must be faithfully studied by one who would
keep posted on the questions raised. Reviewing the ethical treatises
of Schuman and Best, Mr. Romanes enforces the sufficiency of the
Darwinian hypothesis to explain the moral sense in all its protean
forms as proximately due to natural causes. In Popular Science
Monthly, W.S. Lilly discusses materialism and morality (xxx, 474-493),
and Prof. A. P. Peabody speaks of classic and semitic ethics in Andover
Review (x, 61-376). All of the theological periodicals discuss ethical
questions, basing human duty on divine injunction. In addition to the
publications of the Musée Guimet and the journals and proceedings of
the great anthropological societies, the student must consult for the
study of comparative religion the Journal of the Royal Asiatic in Lon-
don and the transactions, ete., of the branchesin India and China. At
the close of the volume of the Journal for 1888 (vol. xx, pt. 4; appen-
dix, pp. 1-218) will be found an excellent index to the whole series.

In the classified index appended to Archiy fiir Anthropologie each
year is a separate collection of titles relating to this branch of anthro-
pology.

The Revue d’Anthropologie and Revue d’Ethnographie also give
each quarter a list of publications, among which are many bearing on
religion.

The most fascinating department of our science is folk-lore. It is so
familiar to every intelligent person from childhood; it is imbedded in
ANTHROPOLOWY. 523

every mind, and furnishes the starting point for every department of
knowledge.
To this subject are now devoted several journals, namely:

Folk-Lore Journal. London. | Melusine. Paris.
The Journal of American Folk-Lore. | Le Museon. Louvain.

Cambridge. | Bibliographie des Traditions. Paris.
Journal of the Gypsy-Lore Society. Lon- | Archeological Review. London,

don. | Revue des Traditions Populaires, Paris.

|

Les Litteratures Populaires de toutes les |
Nations, twenty-seven volumes. Or-
leans.

The English Folk-lore Society has made the greatest possible advance
in systematizing its work by the tabulation of folk-tales. This works
a great economy in twoways. First, two or more persons do not waste
their time by working on the same author. A list of collections is pub-
lished and the name of the tabulator is appended to each volume.
Second, and this is the greatest improvement, there is a form of tabu-
lation prescribed by the society, consisting of the title of the story, the
dramatis persone, an abstract of the story, giving its leading incidents
and leaving out vain repetitions, an alphabetic list of incidents, and so
much bibliography as will enable the future student to follow up the
matter for himself. It can be readily seen how much labor is spared
to the comparative folk-lorist by this economic scheme.

HEXIOLOGY.

The surroundings of a people, the play of the environment on the
people, and their effect on the natureof things around them Mivart calls
hexiology.

In the U. S. National Museum is a room, the funetion of which is to
show how vegetable and animal products have been made contributory
to human weal and happiness. A few titles of books and papers along
this line of research will show how important to us is this branch of
study.

The French have asociété Wacclimatation, patronized by the Govern-
ment, publishing a large series of journals, and consulted with reference
to colonization. Attention may also be ealled to the following: The
animal economic products of India: J.R. Murray. L’influence du milieu
sur les peuples de Asie Centrale: M. de Ujfalvy. On tropical and sub-
tropical climate and the acclimatization of the fair races in hot countries:
D. H. Cullimore. Origin of the domestication of the horse: R. S. Huide-
koper. Le cheval sauvage de la Dzoungaril: Dr. Fauvelle. Equidae
de la‘période quarternaire: Ed. Piette. The metals of ancient Chaldaea:
P. EK. Berthelot. On nephrite and jadeite: F. W. Clarke and G. P. Mer-
rill. Food and fibre plants of the North American Indians: J. S. New-
berry. Nouvelle recherches sur le type sauvage.

In this brief record, doubtless many titles of great value are omitted.
524 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Nevertheless, enough are given to show how many avenues of scientific
research lead up to man as their object. It will be possible in future
summaries to systematize the subject still further. Several journals of
special function are now giving bibliographies in their own departments
so that we shall have only to combine their work to perfect the record.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE HUMAN PERIOD.*

By J. WoopBRIDGE DAVIS.

The earliest exact date we have is that of the victory of Corcebus,
the runner, at the Olympian festival, July 21, B. C. 776. Beyond this,
uncertainty grows from years into decades and from decades into cen-
turies until, in the earliest existing traditions, it becomes supreme ;
and yet man’s history is not half told.

Of the vast preceding ages from which no word has come, the chro-
nology is necessarily based upon traces of the events themselves. So
the best results we can expect from an exploration of this dark region
of time are a meager knowledge of events, a fairly accurate knowledge
of successions, and a very inaccurate knowledge of durations.

There is however an artificial difficulty in the way of the student
of archeology, namely, the several scales used in the division of pre-
historic time. A like difficulty pertaining to the era of written records
has been overcome by means of formule for the translation of dates
from one seale to another. But no systematic attempt seems to have
been made to correlate the various scales applied to the measurement
of the older Quaternary.

For instance, the antiquity of a certain “ find” is rated by reference
to the geological event then taking place; of another, according toa
scale indicated by the successive disappearances of wild animals from
a particular district. Other scales are based upon the progress in
human arts and customs, the successive domestication of animals, ete.
Each author relies especially upon one or two of these modes of reckon-
ing with occasional references to some of the others. Except to experts,
this is confusing.

On this account the chart appended was prepared for private use.
Here it is attempted to exhibit the principal scales in their chronologi-
cal inter-relations. This was accomplished by collecting and arranging
all the cross-references occurring in many of the best works, chiefly
those of Worsaae, Morlot, Gastaldi, Lartet and Christie, Lubbock,
Lyell and Dawkins.

THE HUMAN PERIOD. - 585

The chart explains itself. All the items occurring together in one
column between two horizontal lines, represent the characteristics of
the period embraced by those lines. It has been found useful for de-
termining the relation in time of events originally referred to different
scales, and it also serves to divide the human period into smaller parts
than can any single scale.

The chart relates to Europe only, the most thoroughly investigated
of the continents. Even so, its divisions are not contemporaneous for
all that land. The dawn of written history in Britain breaks eight or
nine centuries after that of Greece. The polished stone and the bronze
ages must have rolled over Eurupe in slowly moving waves. The ad-
vancement of the other arts and the domestication of animals similarly
spread from men to men, retarded by mountain chains and salty chan-
nels. But if these scales were applied to America, the later stone age
alone must be shifted downward at least five thousand years.
WERE THE OSAGES MOUND BUILDERS?

By Dr. J. F. SNYDER, Virginia, Cass County, Illinois,

A reported instance of mound building by the Osage Indians, near
the close of the last century, has been cited by numerous writers on
American ethnology in proof of the otherwise well-authenticated facet
that the custom of erecting mounds over their distinguished dead was
practiced by some of our Indian tribes down to comparatively recent
times. The instance referred to was related by Dr. Beck, in his ‘‘Gaz-
etteer of Missouri and Illinois.”. When writing of the Osage River he
says: ‘Ancient works exist on this river as elsewhere. The remains
of mounds and fortifications are almost everywhere to be seen. One
of the largest mounds in this country has been thrown up on this stream,
within the last thirty or forty years, by the Osages, near the great Osage
village, in honor of one of their deceased chiefs. This fact proves con-
clusively the original object of these mounds, and refutes the theory
that they must necessarily have been erected by a race of men more
civilized than the present tribes of Indians.” *

This was written in 1822. In the fall of 1834, Mr. Featherstonhaugh,
the noted English geologist, when in the vicinity of St. Louis, Missouri,
heard a similar statement in regard to the erection of a large mound, by
the Osages, in the same locality, which he relates as follows: “We
therefore walked into the country a mile and ahalf, to a Major Sibley’s,
to whom I had a letter. - - - He had resided many years amongst
the western Indians as agent of the United States, and had been one
of the commissioners appointed to lay out the Traders’ Road to Santa
Fé, in New Mexico. We soon got into conversation about the lofty
mounds I had seen, when he stated that an ancient chief cf the Osage
Indians (corrupted by the French from Whashash) informed him, whilst
he was a resident amongst them, that a large conical mound (which he,
Major Sibley, was in the habit of seeing every day whilst he resided
amongst them) was constructed when he was a boy. That a chief of
his nation, who was a distinguished warrior, and greatly beloved by the
Indians, and who was called Jean Defoe by the French, unexpectedly

died whilst all the men of his tribe were hunting in a distant country.
His friends buried him in the usual manner, with his weapons, his
earthen pot, and the usual accompaniments, and raised a small mound
over his remains. When the nation returned from the hunt this mound

was enlarged at intervals, every man assisting to carry materials, and
thus the accumulation of earth went on fora long period until it reached
its present height, when they dressed it off at the top to a conical form.
The old chief further said that he had been informed and believed that
all the mounds had a similar origin..”*

It is altogether probable that these two accounts relate to the same
mound, and that Dr. Beck’s source of information regarding it is the
same as Mr. Featherstonhaugh’s. The “ancient chief” may have pur-
posely imposed upon Major Sibley’s credulity in this matter: at any
rate his reliability as a historian of his people is somewhat shaken by
his further statement that ‘‘the tradition had been steadily transmitted
down from their ancestors; that the Whashash (Osages) had originally
emigrated from the east in great numbers, fhe population being too
dense for their hunting-grounds. He described the forks of the Alle-
gheny an‘ Monongahela Rivers, and the Falls of the Ohio, where they
had dwelt some time, and where large bands had separated from them,
and distributed themselves in the surrounding country, ete.”+ The
Osages, itis well known, are a branch of the Dakotas, and migrated
to Missouri from the north, or northwest; and perhaps the only mem-
bers of that tribe who have at any time visited the headwaters of the
Ohio were the few who joined the force that defeated General Braddock
in 1755, and the peaceful delegations that have since visited Washing-
ton City.

The first mention of the Osages in history is by Father Marquette,
who heard of them when descending the Mississippi in 1673; and in his
map of the regions discovered by him he locates them as the ‘* Ouchage.”
on the Missouri River, about the present site of Jefferson City. We
have then no definite account of these Indians until 1719, when Du
Tissenet, a young Canadian-Frenchman, was sent with a party, by M.
DeBienville, then governor of Louisiana, to explore the western
wilderness in search of ores and precious metals. Du Tissenet’s expedi-
tion set out from Kaskaskia, and, traversing southern Missouri, followed
the Osage River—which he so named—-to its northwestern sources in
Kansas. He visited the Osages at their “Great Village” near the con-
fluence of the Little Osage and the Marmiton, in what is now Vernon
County. in Missouri, and which was then the central point of their
country. During the next year, 1720, Renault, with his lientenant, La
Motte, and party, including five hundred negro slaves, arrived at Fort
Chartres, and at once sent out exploring par ties in all directions in

questof precious ores. They opened lead mines in the vicinity of Potosi,
at Minea Renault and Mine La Motte, which have been, more or less, in
operation to the present day; and established trading posts and inti-
mate commercial relations with the Osages. In 1806 Lieutenant Pike,
on his expedition to the mountains, found the Osages at their “Great”
and ‘ Little” villages, where they had entertained Du Tissenet eighty-
seven years before; both travelers locating the larger or main village
in what is now Blue Mound Township, Vernon County, Missouri. Sey-
eral years before Lieutenant Pike’s visit—in 1787—Pierre Chouteau
had established, near the Great Village, a fortified trading post which
he named Fort Carondelet in honor of the Baron De Carondelet.

The topographical features of the country bordering the Osage River
are in many respects very peculiar and strangely attractive. In the
greater part of its course the river has cut its way through ledges of
massive magnesian limestone which tower above the beautiful stream in
domes and terraces and knobs that seem to have been designed by
skillful architects. Professor Swallow says of these bluffs, about the
junction of the Niangua and Linn Creek with the Osage, they ‘slope
back into knobs and ridges, which are frequently surrounded by
numerous natural terraces so regular and uniform that they appear
like the work of human hands. These terraces are formed by tie de-
composition of the strata of magnesian limestone which form the blutts.”*
Farther back from the river, remarks the same writer, ‘‘ The prairie of
this region is characterized by what are called knobs or mounds; they
are somewhat variable in size and form, but usually present the ap-
pearance of a truncated cone. The tops of these mounds are usually
flat, and covered by a thin soil, underlaid by a durable stratum of
sandstone or limestone, which crops out on all sides near the top, pre-
vents the wearing away of the upper edges, and preserves the well
defined angle between the top and sides; while the stratum of shale or
clay, which forms the lower part, is easily decomposed and carried
away by aqueous agencies. The sides rise with a gentle declivity, at
first, but become more and more abrupt until they are nearly perpen-
dicular at the top. The most of these mounds belong to the coal meas-
ures; but those near Bolivar are in the Chemung group, the upper
beds of the vermicular sandstone and shales forming the top, and the
underlying shales the lower part of them.”+ Of the mounds men-
tioned by Professor Swallow, near Bolivar, one of the largest was
almost in sight at my front door. It stood, in bold relief, near the
middle of a cultivated field, a truncated pyramid, 20 feet high, with
level top 20 by 50 feet in dimensions, and with angles and sides true

and regular; the complete duplicate in appearance of many artificial
mounds vo be seen east of the Mississippi.*

The region at the head of the Osage River, particularly the district
lying between its main branches, the Marais des Cygnes and the Little
Osage, is mostly prairie, rising in graceful undulations and ridges, and
isolated conical mounds, with broad valleys between, eroded by aque-
ous or glacial action, combining in landscapes of charming interest and
beauty.

Prof. G. C. Broadhead, late State geologist of Missouri, in treating
of the geology of Vernon County, remarks: ‘It is here diversified by
clusters of mounds, reaching more than 100 feet above the general sur-
face of the prairie. Blue Monnd is 150 feet high, and can be seen for
a long distance. Timbered Hill, near the mouth of Marmaton and
Little Osage is a round, isolated mound, 1/0 feet above the Marmaton,
and over 100 feet above the surrounding plain. Being several miles
from other marked elevations, it is seen for many miles off. North of the
Little Osage a series of mounds extends east and west along the county
line at an elevation of over 100 feet above the gently stretching val-
ley at their base. - - - IT urther west, in range 32, we find the
mounds rising still higher. These mounds continue on southward
through the county, interrupted sometimes for several miles by the
streams. From Moundville a high ridge or series of mounds connec-
ted, trends off to the south line of the county, rising near the northern
and middle line to 140 feet above the lower valleys, or 80 to 100 feet
above Moundville Valley. - - - The occasional occurrence of these
mounds gives a charming variety to the landscape. Many of them can
be seen at a long distance, and from their summits the views are often
very fine. - - - Undoubtedly this county has been subjected to
glacial agency at some former period of time. Its results may be seen
in isolated mounds and deep valleys between. The amount of erosion
must have been of great force and of long continuance, if we view tlie
mounds and long stretches of distance from one to the other. When pro-
tected by the upper series of limestones, the erosion was not complete;
but if these limestones were much broken, or entirely absent, leaving
the sandstones exposed, the waters would rush down with resistless
force, and bear away all the softer material.” t

In a foot-note on page 82 of his exhaustive monograph on ‘ The
Mounds of the Mississippi Valley Historically Considered,” Prof. Lucien
Carr, in discussing the trustworthiness of a book purporting to have
been written by one J. D. Hunter, (‘* Memoirs of a Captivity,” ete., Lon-
don, 1828,) remarks: “To gono further than the instances quoted in the
text, we find undoubted evidence that the Osages have, within the pres-
ent century, built both stone heaps and burial mounds.”

*These dimensions are not exact, but given from memory, the writer not having
seen the mound since 1860.

WERE THE OSAGES MOUND-BUILDERS ? 591

So far as history can aid us in tracing the Osages we are satisfied that
at the period of Marquette’s descent of the Mississippi, in 1673, they oc-
cupied one or both banks of the Missouri River, at and above the
mouth of the Osage; and that they established the central villages of
their tribe at the head of the Osage River about the year 1700, or a few
years before that date, and remained there until their removal, in 1826,
farther west. That, in that time, they erected stone heaps occasionally
over the graves of their dead—to preserve the bodies from the ravages
of wild beasts—is true, for some of the stone heaps, attesting the fact,
are still to be seen there. But they built noearthen mounds. In all
the region of their occupancy of the immediate valley of the Osage
River there is not an artificial mound of earth to be found; and it is
not reasonable to suppose that such monuments, if erected, should in
the lapse of less than a century have so completely disappeared. Pro-
fessor Broadhead, who carefully explored the entire valley of the Osage
in prosecuting the geological survey of Missouri, in a private letter re-
plying to my inquiries, says: *‘ Lhave seen noartificial sepulchral mounds
on the Osage River. With the exception of pictographs, on the rocks,
about 25 miles above its mouth, I found but few, if any, prehistoric
remains anywhere on that river.”

Robert I. Holeombe, esq., who ranks little below Parkman in Ameri-
can historical research, after spending many months at or near the
site of the “Great Osage village,” when writing of that locality in his
‘History of Vernon County, Missouri,” says: ‘It does not seem tbat
the mysterious race of beings termed the Mound Builders ever dwelt here
in any considerable numbers or for any considerable period. But few
traces of their occupation remain, if they ever existed. In some parts
of the county there are a few small elevations resembling the sepui-
chral mounds of the Mound Builders; but it can not be asserted that
they are not natural. If any examination has been made, it has not dis-
closed any noteworthy archeological specimens, and few, if any, flint
arrow-heads, lance heads, stone axes, or fragments of pottery have been
found.”* After calling Mr. Holcombe’s attention specially to this
branch of inquiry he informed me, in the course of our correspondence,
that in all the region he had examined he had not seen an artificial
earthen mound; and had met but few, if any, evidences of a pre-exist-
ent ‘stone age.” Of the many residents on and near the Osage, from
its mouth to its sources, to whom I have addressed my inquiries, not
one has seen an artificial earthern mound there, and but few have
found aborignal stone implements of any description in that region.
Ali agree that such evidences of prehistoric occupancy are almost to-
tally absent.

Ki. R. Morerod, M. D., an old resident of Vernon County, Missouri,
an intelligent and scholarly man, who had devoted much time and
thought to the study of American history and antiquities, and who per-

“History of Vernon County, Missouri. St. Louis. Brown & Co. 1887, pp. 87,85.
592 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS,

sonally inspected every locality on the upper Osage that had been in-
habited by the Osage Indians, with the view of collecting reliable ma-
terials for his ‘‘Centennial History of Vernon County” (published in
1876), and to secure, if possible, reiics of ancient Indian art for the Phila-
delphia Exposition of that year, in writing to ne says: “As far as my
knowledge extends there are but very few evidences of prehistoric man
existing in Vernon County. Excepting a few flint arrow-points, I do
not know of a stone implement of any kind, neither grooved ax, celt,
or ornament, ever having been found here. Nor is there an artificial
sepulchral mound in our county, though we have many magnificent
natural mounds of geological origin. Absence of Indian burials here
has often suggested to my mind the query, what did the Osages do
with their dead?) We know that they were a numerous tribe, and that
this district was the central point of their territory for nearly, or quite,
a century and a quarter; yet although [ have searched all over the sites
of the Big and Little Osage villages, and in every direction throughout
the county, I have failed to find any indication of Indian burying
grounds, or any isolated graves that could, with any degree of certainty,
be attributed to the Indians. I am therefore of the opinion that with
the exception of their distinguished men, these Indians cremated their
dead. In my search for Indian relics here, in 1876, all that I found
were brass and pewter ornaments, glass beads, fragments of gun fliné-
locks, broken iron and copper utensils, and crockery of French make.
There are no Indiau graves here on the crest of our ridges and bluffs,
or on the top ef our natural mounds, as is the case elsewhere through-
out the Mississippi Valley, with but-one known exception. A very noted
chief of the Osages, named Pah-hus-kah, or Pawhuska, but called by
the early French ‘*Cheveux Blanche,” said to have been killed in a
skirmish with the whites, was buried on the top of the big Blue Mound,
and over his grave a Jarge stone heap was erected by his people. Dr.
Badger, an old settler here, says that on his arrival, in 1844, this stone
heap was a very conspicious landmark and could be seen from a great
distance. At that time it was 8 or 9 feet high and aboat the same in
diameter at its base. When [I first saw it, in 1867, there was still a por-
tion of it plainly to be seen from the prairie in all directions; but in 1876
there was not a vestige of it remaining.”

Of the death and burial of this chief Mr. Holcombe says, “The exact
date of the death of old White Hair can not here be given. He died
at his village in the northern part of this county, however, and was
buried on the summit of Blue Mound, in a stone sepulcher made for the
occasion. It is probable that this was about the year 1824. His grave
_ was afterward broken into by white vandals in search of treasure.”*

To the foregoing statements it may not be inappropriate to add the
results of my own personal observations. During my residence of eight
years in southwestern Missouri, 1853-1861, I traversed the entire valley

of the Osage River, from its junction with the Missouri to the extreme
heads of the Little Osage and of the Marais des Cygnes, and was
familiar with its entire southern water-shed west of the Niangua. And,
though always a persistent relic hunter, I never found, or saw, or heard
of having been found by others, in that time, or since, in all that region,
exceeding a dozen flint arrow-points, and not one stone ax, or celt, or
other implement in stone, or ornament of bone or shell, or any frag-
ments of Indian pottery. The only burials presumably Indian I met
with were on the east bank of Sac River, near the village of Orleans,
in Polk County, Missouri. The perpendicular rocky cliff rises from the
river bottom at that place 75 or 80 feet, and is capped with shelly sub-
carboniferous limestone, overgrown with briars and stunted bushes.
On the verge of this precipice I found, in 1853, five small cairns a few
feet from each other, constructed of rough stones rudely laid up, in di-
mensions 34 feet high and 3 or 4 feet in diameter. Ov opening them
each was found to contain the fragments of a single human skeleton,
much decayed, and broken in small pieces by the falling in of the loose
stone covering. From the relative position of the bones, L inferred that
the body had been placed upon the bare rock, in a squatting position,
with the face to the west overlooking the river, and that the broken
rocks of the surface had been piled up around it to protect it from
destruction by wolves and vultures. The only work of art I discovered
in or about the five stone heaps was a weli-worn gun-flint with one of
the skeletons. IL saw no artificial earthen mounds there of any descrip-
tion.

In treating specially of the history of Blue Mound Township, Mr.
Holcombe says on page 539 of his “* History of Vernon County:” “In
many other graves in the mound |Blue Mound| there have been found
mingled with human bones tomahawks, knives, arrow-points, shell
implements and ornaments, bone ear-rings, beads of various materials,
sizes, and shapes, and other curious articles. Some of these relics are
apparently of such antiquity as to lead almost to the thought that the
graves containing them may be those of the Mound Builders, or of
some other prehistoric race; but this is not at all probable. The
graves are undoubtedly those of Osages, who, as is well known, were
in this country as early at least as the year 1700.”

I have not learned Mr. Holecombe’s authority for the statement he
makes in regard to the discovery of **arrow-points, Shell implements,
and ornaments, bone ear-rings,” etc., found in the graves on Blue
Mound. My investigations have failed to verify it. By persons who
have resided in that immediate vicinity at an early day I am informed
that in years past, quite a number of graves were distinctly seen on
the slopes of the Blue Mound; but as in dimensions, construction, and
relative position they exhibited the usual characteristics of an ordinary
cemetery, and as none of them were opened to determine the question,

it was not known whether they inclosed the remains of Indians or white
persons. And as to the relics, it is now not known that any of them
were actually found in the graves; but they were found on the surface
of tbe ground there, and subsequently turned up by the plow about
the base of tne mound, as well as about the sites of the Big and Little
Osage villages—as Dr. Morerod states—and are to this day occasion-
ally found there. But the “tomahawks” are made of iron, and the
ear-rings of brass; and if any implements or ornaments of bone or shell
have been found associated with them, the reasonable conciusion is
that they, too, were of French or English manufacture.

Systematic investigation by adepts may yet discover the mortuary
customs of the Osages. Their cemeteries have perhaps not yet been
found. They died, of course, but as yet we are ignorant of the disposi-
tion of their corpses. The suggestion of Dr. Morerod that they prac-
tised cremation is scarcely tenable, for the negative reasons that no
mention of such an extraordinary custom is made by Dr. Tissenet,
Rénault, or Lieutenant Pike; and that none of the crematories, or
ancient fire-hearths (“altars”), have yet been found in the original
Osage territory. In the absence of more accurate knowledge upon
this point, it is not a violent presumption that these Indians—as the
-awnees, Dakotas, and other tribes of the plains have since been accus-
tomed to do—placed their dead upon pole-scaffolds on the prairies, and
in the branches of trees in the woods, as their final disposition, where
the remains decayed, and in time were dispersed by the elements.

Hunter, in his “Captivity,” p. 300, says, of the Osages, ‘at or soon
after burial, they cover the grave with stones, and for years after oc-
casionally resort to it, and mourn over or recount the merits and vir-
tues of its silent tenant.” This was not perhaps their general custom;
but, in regard to the burial of Old White Hair, is strictly true. Mr.
Holcombe confirms it in his statement: “For many years up to 1870
the Osages made annual pilgrimages to the site of their ancient towns
in this county, and of the graves of their ancestors and the tomb of the
renowned chieftain, Pawhuska, on Blue Mound. Gathering about the
mighty mound containing the ashes of their progenitors, they called to
mind their virtues and lifting up their voices wept loudly and bitterly.
Many citizens of the county have often heard them at their lamenta-
tions. The Osages themselves called the Blue Mound the “ Crying
Mound” because it was to them a place of mourning and weeping.” *
have seen it nowhere stated that the Osages conducted their lamenta-
tions at any other locality excepting the Blue Mound, which towered
above their principal village; and this fact alone is a strong basis for
for the supposition that about the apex of this majestic natural eleva-
tion these Indians interred all of their distinguished chiets; thus dis-
posing of them, when dead, and of their common people’s corpses by
different methods. We know that old White Hair was buried there,

* History of Vernon County, pp. 142, 143.
WERE THE OSAGES MOUND-BUILDERS ? 595

and itis reasonably certain that this was the mound pointed out to
Major Sibley, by the ‘‘old Chief,” as the burial place of “Jean Defoe.” *

The singular absence of stone and bone implements in the valley of
the Osage can only be explained by the hypothesis that prior to its oe-
cupancy by the Osage Indians it was a neutral ground, only occasion-
ally visited by hunting parties of Indians residing on the Missouri, to
the north, and on the Arkansas, to the south; in both of which local-
ities evidences of long-continued tenancy before the knowledge of
metals are quite abundant. It is altogether probable, too, that when
the Osages abandoned their territory on the Missouri and removed to
the headwaters of the Osage River—about the close of the seventeenth
century—they had secured fire-earms and European implements and
utensils, and had adopted many of the methods of life of their French
visitors.t

The manners, customs, and practices of these Indians before their
migration to the mounds and streams of Vernon County can now ouly
be conjectured; but there is no reason to doubt that in every respect
they were identical with those of other pre-Columbian Indians of the
Northwest. We are assured, however, that after that event in their his-
tory they no longer employed stone as a material for weapons and tools;
and they erected no mounds of earth as monuments over their dead, or
for any other purpose.

Dr. Beck, author of the “Gazetteer” before mentioned, may have
inspected the Osage River personally before he published the statement
that “Ancient works exist on this river, as elsewhere,” and that ‘re-
mains of fortifications and mounds are almost everywhere to be seen”
there. And, if he did, it is not astonishing that he was led into such
an error upon viewing the beautiful, faultless domes and terraces carved
upon the great rocky cliffs of the Osage and the Niangua by the ea-
pricious elements ; or the isolated natural mounds in the prairie region
beyond—enduring monuments, not of a by-gone people, but of a vastly
remote glacial force. For when he wrote—sixty-seven years ago—arch-
eology had not become a science, and geology was but in its infancy.

Nor is it surprising that Major Sibley, an intelligent and educated
officer of the Guvernment, who resided for some years at the base of
the great Blue: Mound, should hav e accepted, without doubt or question,

*The name of nae eee is tere eonabe incorrectly written. At the period of
Lieutenant Pike’s visit, in 1806, Cheveux Blanche was the Bead chief of the Big
Osages, and his son, Jean La Fon—as Pike wrote the name in his journal and official
reports—was the second chief in authority. I have thought this orthography may
possibly also be erroneous; because I remember, when a boy at my home near St.
Louis, hearing the ‘‘ engagers,” recently returned from the Indian country, often
mention a chief whom they called Jean Le Fou—‘‘ Mad,” or ‘‘ Crazy John ”—on
account of his peculiar eccentricities. It way be that Jean Defoe, Jean La Fon and
Jean Le Fou were identical. ;

THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE
ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. *

By Prof. WittiaM Harkness, U.S. Naval Observaiory,

Two centuries ago the world was just beginning to awaken from an
intellectual lethargy which had lasted a thousand years. During all
that time the children had lived as their parents before them, the
mechanical arts had been at a stand-still, and the dicta of Aristotle had
been the highest authority in science. But now the night of medieval-
ism was approaching its end, and the dawn of modern progress was at
hand. Galileo had laid the foundation for accurate clocks, by discover-
ing the isochronism of the simple pendulum; had proved that under the
action of gravity, light bodies fall as rapidly as heavy ones; had invented
the telescope and with it discovered the spots on the sun, the moun-
tains on the moon, the satellites of Jupiter, and the so-called triple
character of Saturn; and, after rendering himself immortal by his advo-
cacy of the Copernican system, had gone to his grave, aged, blind, and
fullof sorrows. His contemporary, Kepler, had discovered the laws—
which while history endures, will associate his name with the theory
of planetary motion; and he also had passed away. The first Cassini
was still a young man, his son was a little child, and his grandson and
great-grandson, all of whom were destined to be directors of the Paris
Observatory, were yet unborn. The illustrious Huyghens, the discov-
erer of Saturn’s rings, and the father of the undulatory theory of light,
was in the zenith of his powers. The ingenious Hooke was a little
younger, and Newton, towering above them all, had recently invented
fluxions, and on the 28th of April, 1686, had presented his Principia
to the Royal Society of London and given the theory of gravitation to
the world. Bragley, who discovered nutation and the aberration of
light; Franklin, the statesman and philosopher, who first drew the
lightning from the clouds; Doliond, the inventor of the achromatic tel-

much in perfecting algebra, the calculus, and the lunar theory; Laplace,
the author of the _ Mécanique Céleste; Rumford, who laid the founda-

tion of the mechanical theory of heat; Dalton, the author of the atomic
theory upon which all chemistry rests; and Bessel, the greatest of mod-
ern astronomers,—these and others almost as illustrious, whom we can
not even name to-night, were still in the womb of time.

Pure science first felt the effects of the new intellectual life, and it
was more than a century later before the arts yielded to its influence.
Then came Hargreaves, the inventor of the spinning-jenny; Ark-
wright, the inventor of the cotton-spinning frame; Watt, who gave us
the condensing steam-engine; Jacquard, the inventor of the loom for
weaving figured stuffs; Murdock, the originator of gas-lighting; Evans,
the inventor of the high-pressure steam-engine; Fulton, the tather of
steam navigation ; Trevithick, who ranks very near Watt and Evansin
perfecting the steam-engine; and Stephenson, the father of railroads.
If now we add the names of those who have given us the telegraph, to
wit, Gauss, the eminent physicist and the greatest mathematician of
the present century; Weber, Wheatstone, and Henry, all famous phys-
icists, and Morse, the inventor and engineer, we have before us the
demi-gods who have transformed the ancient into the modern world,
given us machinery which has multiplied the productive power of the
human race many fold, annihilated time and space, and bestowed upon
toiling millions a degree of comfort and luxury which was unknown to
kings and emperors of old.

The discoveries and inventions of the last two centuries have so far
exceeded all others within historic times, that we are amply justified in
calling this an age of amazing progress, and under the circumstances
a little self-glorification is pardonable, perhaps even natural. The
weekly and monthly records of scientific events which appear in so
many hewspapers and magazines are the immediate result of this, and
the great increase of ephemeral scientific literature has led multitudes
of educated people to believe that such records represent actual prog:
ress. The multiplication of bricks facilitates the building of houses, but
does not necessarily improve architecture. Similarly, the multiplica-
tion of minor investigations improves our knowledge of details, but
rarely affects the great philosophic theories upon which science is
founded. The importance of human actions is measured by the degree
in which they affect human thought, and the only way of permanently
affecting scientific thought is by modifying or extending scientific
theories. The men who do that, are neither numerous, nor do they re-
quire weekly paragraphs to record their deeds; but their names are
honored by posterity. Even in this golden age the advance of science
is not steady, but is made by spasmodic leaps and bounds. Mere
scientific brick-making, commonly called progress, is always the order
of the day until some genius startles the world by a discovery affecting
accepted theories. Then every effort is directed in the new line of
thought until it is measurably worked out, and after that brick-making
again resumes its place. While the progress in two centuries has been
THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 599

immense, the progress in a week or a month is usually almost nil.
Optimism has its uses in many departments of human affairs, but
science should be cool and dispassionate, having regard only tor the
truth. To make a trustworthy estimate of the actual state of the whole
vast realm of science would be a task beyond the powers of any one
man; but perhaps it will not be amiss to spend the time at our disposal
this evening in briefly reviewing the recent progress and present con-
dition of the fundamental processes upon which the exact sciences
rest;—I allude to the methods of weighing and measuring.

Physical science deals with many quantities, but they are all so re-
lated to each other that almost every one of them can be expressed in
terms of three fundamental units. As several systems of such units
are possible, it is important to select the most convenient, and the con-
siderations which guide us in that respect are the following:

(1) The quantities selected should admit of very accurate comparison
with other quantities of the same kind.

(2) Such comparisons should be possible at all times and in all places.

(3) The processes necessary for making such comparisons should be
easy and direct.

(4) fhe fundamental units should be such as to admit of easy defi-
nitions and simple dimensions for the various derived units.

Scientific men have long agreed that these requirements are best
fulfilled by adopting as the fundamental units, a definite length, a
definite mass, and a definite interval of time. Length is an element
which can be very accurately measured and copied, but it must be
defined by reference to some concrete material standard, as for ex-
ample, a bar of metal, and as all substances expand and contract with
changes of temperature, it is necessary to state the temperature at
which the standard is correct. A standard of mass, consisting of a
piece of platinum, quartz, or other material not easily affected by
atmospheric influences, probably fulfills the conditions set forth above
beiter than any other kind of magnitude. Its comparison with
other bodies of approximately equal mass is effected by weighing,
and as that is among the most exact of all laboratory operations, very
accurate copies of the standard can be made, and they can be carried
from place to place with little risk of injury. Time is also an
element which can be measured with extreme precision. The imme-
diate instruments of measurement are clocks and chronometers, but
their running is checked by astronomical observations and the ulti-
mate standard is the rotation of the earth itself.

It is important to note that the use of three fundamental units is
simply a matter of convenience and not a theoretical necessity, for the
unit of mass might be defined as that which at unit distance would
generate in a material point unit velocity in unit time; and thus we
should have a perfectly general system of measurement based upon only
two fundamental units, namely, those of space and time. Such a sys-
tem is quite practicable in astronomy, but ean not yet be applied with
600 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

accuracy to ordinary terrestrial purposes. According to the law of
gravitation
Mass = Acceleration x (Distance)?

and as in the case of the earth we can measure the quantities on the
right-hand side of that equation with considerable accuracy, we can sat-
isfactorily determine the earth’s mass in terms of the supposed unit.
That suffices for the needs of astronomy, but for other scientific and
commercial purposes a standard of mass having a magnitude of about
a pound is necessary, and as two such masses can be compared with
each other from five to ten thousand times more accurately than either
of them can be determined in terms of the supposed unit, three funda-
mental units are preferable to two.

The Chaldeans, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans all seem
to have had systems of weights and measures based upon tolerably defi:
nite standards, but after the decline of the Roman Empire these stand
ards seem to have been forgotten, and in the beginning of the sixteenth
century the human body had so far become the standard of measure-
ment that the units in common use, as for example, the foot, palm, ete.,
were frequently taken directly from it. The complete table of measures
of length was then as follows: The breadth (not the length) of four

barley corns make a digit, or finger breadth; four digits make a palm
(measured across the middle joints of the fingers); four palms are one
foot; a foot and a half is a cubit; ten palms, or two feet and a half, are
a step; two steps, or five feet, are a pace; ten feet are a perch; one
hundred and twenty-five paces are an Italic stadium; eight stadia, or
one thousand paces, are an Italic mile; four Italic miles are a German
mile; and five Italic miles are a Swiss mile It was then the practice
to furnish standards of length in books by printing in them lines a
foot or a palm long, according to the size of the page, and from these
and other data it appears that the foot then used on the continent of
Europe had a length of about ten English inches.

In England the first attempts at scientific accuracy in matters of
measurement date from the beginning of the seventeenth century, when
John Greaves, who must be considered as the earliest of the scientific
metrologists, directed attention to the difference between the Roman
and English foot by tolerably accurate determinations of the former,
and also attempted the investigation of the Roman weights. He was
followed by Dr. Edward Bernard, who wrote a treatise on ancient
weights and measures about 1685, and towards the end of the century
the measurements of the length of a degree by Picard and J. D. Gassini
awakened the attention of the French to the importance of rigorously
exact standards. In considering the progress of science with respect
to standards of length, we may safely confine our inquiries to the En-
glish yard and the French toise and meter, for during the last two hun-
dred years they have been almost the only standards adopted in scien-
tific operations.
THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 601

The English measures of length have come down from the Saxons,
but the oldest standards now existing are the exchequer yards of Henry
VIT (1490)* and Elizabeth (1588).t These are both brass end measures,
the former being an octagonal rod about half an inch in diameter, very
coarsely made, and as rudely divided into inches on the right-hand end
and into sixteenths of a yard on the left-hand end; the latter, a square
rod with sides about half an inch wide, also divided into sixteenths of
a yard and provided with a brass bed having end pieces between which
the yard fits. One end of the bed is divided into inches and half inches.
Francis Baily, who saw this Elizabethan standard in 1836, speaks of it
as ‘‘ this curious instrament, of which it is impossible, at the present
day, to speak too much in derision or contempt. A common kitchen
poker, filed at the ends in the rudest manner by the most bungling
workman, would make as good a standard. It has been broken
asunder, and the two pieces have been dove-tailed together, but so
badly that the joint is nearly as loose as that of a pair of tongs. The
date of this fracture I could not ascertain, it having occurred beyond
the memory or knowledge of any of the officers at the Exchequer. And
yet, till within the last ten years, to the disgrace of this country, copies
of this measure have been circulated all over Europe and America,
with a parchment document accompanying them (charged with a stamp
that costs £3 10s. exclusive of official fees) certifying that they are true
copies of the English standard.”¢

In the year 1742 certain members of the Royal Society of London,
and of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, proposed that, in order
to facilitate a comparison of the scientific operations carried on in the
two countries, accurate standards of the measures and weights of both
should be prepared and preserved in the archives of each of these
societies. This proposition having been approved, Mr. George Graham,
at the instance of the Royal Society, had two substantial brass rods
made, upon which he laid off, with the greatest care, the length of
three English feet from the standard yard kept at the Tower of London.
These two rods, together with a set of troy weights, were then sent
over to the Paris Academy, which body, in like manner, had the measure
ofa French half toise set off upon the rods, and keeping one, as previously
agreed, returned the other, together with a standard weightof twomares,
to the Royal Society. In 1835, Baily declared this copy of the half
toise to be of little value, because the original toise-étalon was of iron
and the standard temperature in France differed from that in England.g
In his opinion the French should have sent over an iron half toise in
exchange for the English brass yard, but this criticism loses much of
its force when it is remembered that in 1742 neither England nor France

had fixed upon a temperature at which their standards were to be re-
garded as of the true length. On the return of the rod from Paris Mr.
Graham caused Jonathan Sisson to divide the English yard and the
French half toise each into three equal parts, after which the rod was
deposited in the archives of the Royal Society, where it still remains.*
Objection having been made that the original and legal standard yard
of England was not the one at the Tower, but the Elizabethian stand-
ard at the Exchequer, the Royal Society requested Mr. Graham to com-
pare his newly made scale with the latter standard, and on Friday,
April 22, 1743, he dic so in the presence of a committee of seven mem-
bers of the Royal Society. In the following week the same gentlemen
compared the Royal Society’s scale with the standards at Guildhall and
the Tower, and also with the standards of the Clock-makers’ Company.
These comparisons having shown that the copy of the Tower yard upon
the Royal Society’s scale was about 0.0075 of an inch longer than the
standard at the Exchequer. Mr. Graham inscribed upon the Royal So-
ciety’s scale a copy of the latter standard also, marking it with the
letters Exch., to distinguish it from the former, which was marked E.
(English), and from the half toise which was marked F. (French).t

In the year 1758 the House of Commons appointed a committee to
inquire into the original standards of weights and measures of England;
and under instructions from that committee, the celebrated instru-
ment-maker, John Bird, prepared two brass rods, respecting which the
committee speak as follows in their report: ‘And having those rods,
together with that of the Royal Society laid in the same place, at the
receipt of the Exchequer, all night with the standards of length kept
there, to prevent the variation which the difference of air might make
upon them, they the next morning compared them all and by the means
of beam compasses brought by Mr. Bird found them to agree as near
as it was possible.”t{ One of these rods was arranged as a matrix for
testing end measures, and the other was a line meastre which the com-
mittee recommended should be made the legal standard of England,
and which has since been known as Bird’s standard of 1758. Respect-
ing the statement that after lying together all night the rods were ali
found to agree as near as it was possible, Baily says: ‘This is some-
what remarkable, and requires further explanation, which unfortu-
nately can not now be accurately obtained. For it is notorious that
the measure of the yard of the Royal Society’s scale differs very con-
siderably from the standard yard at the Exchequer: - - - Owing
to this singular confusion of the lengths of the measures, which does
not appear to have been unravelled by any subsequent Committee, it
has happened that the Imperial standard yard - - - has been
assumed nearly 1 ~ 140 of an inch longer than the ancient measure of
the kingdom.”§ There is little difficulty in surmising what Bird did.
The Exchequer standard consisted of a rod and its matrix. The Royal

THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 603

Society’s committee assumed the rod to be the true standard of 36
inches, and upon that assumption Graham’s measurements gave for the
length of the matrix 36.0102 inches, and for the length of the Royal
Society’s yard 36.0075 inches. The Parliamentary Committee of 1758
probably assumed the standard to consist of the rod anid matrix
together, which seems the better view; and by laying the rod in its
matrix and measuring to the joint between them Bird would have got
a length of about 36.0051 inches. The mean between that and 36.0075
would be 36.0063, which differs very little from the length of Bird’s
standard resvlting from Sir George Skuckburgh’s measurements.
Thus the committee’s statement is justified, and there has been no falsi- °
fication of the ancient standards.

On December 1, 1758, Parliament created another committee on
weights and measures which in April, 1759, repeated the recommenda-
tion that Bird’s standard of 1758 should be legalized, and farther recom-
mended that a copy of it should be made and deposited in some public
office, to be used only on special oceasions.* The copy was made by
Bird in 1760, but owing to circumstances entirely unconnected with
the subject, no legislation followed for sixty-four years.

The Royal Commission appointed during the reign of George III to
consider the subject of weights and measures made its first report on
June 24, 1819, and therein recommended the adoption of the standard
of length which had been used by General Roy in measuring the base
on Hounslow Heath;t+ but in a second report, made July 13, 1820, they
wrote: “We - - - have examined, since our last report, the rela-
tion of the best authenticated standards of length at present in exist-
ence, to the instruments employed for measuring the base on Hounslow
Heath, and in the late trigonometrical operations :—But we have very
unexpectedly discovered, that an error has been committed in the con-
struction of some of these instruments.¢ We are therefore obliged to
recur to the originals which they were intended to represent; and we
have found reason to prefer the Parliamentary standard executed by
Bird in 1760, which we had not before received, both as being laid down
in the most accurate manner, and as the best agreeing with the most
extensive comparisons, which have been hitherto executed. by various
observers, and circulated through Europe; and in particular with the
scale employed by the late Sir George Shuckburgh.” §

- Accordingly, when in 1824, Parliament at length took action, Bird’s
standard of 1760 was adopted instead of that of 1758. The former be-
ing a copy of a copy, its selection as a national standard of length seems
so singular that the circumstances which brought about that result
should scarcely be passed ‘over in silence. Bird had a very accurate
brass scale 90 inches long, which he used in all his dividing operations,
whether upon circles or straight lines, and which Dr. Maskelyne said

604 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

yard E.* In the year 1792, or 1793, the celebrated Edward Troughton
made for himself a 5-foot scale, which conformed to Bird’s, and which
he afterwards used in laying down the divisions of the various instru-
ments that passed through his hands. This was the original of all
the standard scales he ever made, and at the beginning of the present
century he believed these copies, which were made by the aid of micro-
‘meter microscopes, to be so exact that no variations could possibly be
detected in them either from the original or from each other. Among
the earliest of the scales so made by Troughton was the one used by Sir
George Shuckburgh in 1796/98 in his important scientific operations
for the improvement of the standards. Subsequently, the length of the
meter was determined by comparison with this seale and with the
supposed fac-simile of it made by Troughton for Professor Pictet. of
Geneva; and thus it happened that on the continent of Europe all
measures were converted into English units by a reference to Sir
George Shuckburgh’s scale. The Royal Commission of 1819 believed
Bird’s standard of 1760 to be identical with Shuckburgh’s seale, and
they legalized it rather than the standard of 1758, in order to avoid
disturbing the value of the English yard which was then generally
accepted for scientific purposes.

There are yet four other scales of importance in the history of English
standards, namely: The brass 5-foot scale made for Sir George Shuck-
burgh by Troughton in 1796; two iron standard yards, marked 1A and
2A, made for the English Ordnance Survey department by Messrs.
Troughton and Simms in 1826~27, and the Royal Society’s standard
yard, constructed by Mr. George Dollond, under the direction of Cap-
tain Henry Kater, in 1831.

Bearing in mind the preceding history, the genesis of the present
English standard yard may be thus sammarized: In 1742 Graham trans-
ferred to.a bar made for the Royal Society a length which he intended
should be that of the Tower yard, but which was really intermediate
between the Exchequer standard yard of Elizabeth and its matrix.
That length he marked with the letter E, and although destitute of legal
authority, it was immediately accepted as the scientific standard and
was copied by the famous instrument-makers of the time with all the
accuracy then attainable. Thus it is in fact the prototype to which ail
the accurate scales made in England between 1742 and 1850 can be
traced. Bird’s standard of 1758 was compared with the Exchequer
standard and with the Royal Society’s yard E, and was of a length be-
tween the two. Bird’s standard of 1760, legalized as the Imperial
standard in June, 1824, was copied from his standard of 1758. After
becoming the Imperial standard, Bird’s standard of 1760 was compared
with Sir George Shuckburgh’s scale by Captain Kater in 1830, and by
Mr. Francis Baily in 1834; with the Ordnance yards 1A and 2A in 1834
by Lieutenant Murphy, R. E., Lieutenant Johnson, R. N., and Messrs.

F. Baily and Donkin; and with Kater’s Royal Society yard by Captain
Kater in 1831. On October 16, 1834, the Imperial standard (Bird’s
standard of 1760) was destroyed by the burning of the houses of Parlia-
ment, in which it was lodged, and very soon thereafter the Lords of the
Treasury took measures to recover its length. Preliminary inquiries
were begun on May 11, 1858, and on June 20, 1843, they resulted in the
appointment of a commission to superintend the construction of new
Parliamentary standards of length and weight; among whose members
the Astronomer Royal (now Sir George B. Airy), Messrs. F. Baily,
ht. Sheepshanks, and Prof. W. H. Miller were prominent. The labori-
ous investigations and experiments carried out by that commission can-
not be described here, but it will suffice to say that for determining the
true length of the new standard Mr. Sheepshanks employed a pro-
visional yard, marked upon a new brass bar designated “ Brass 2,”
which he compared as accurately as possible with Sir George Shuck-
burgh’s seale, the two Ordnance yards, and Kater’s Royal Society yard.
The results in terms of the lost Imperial standard were as follows:
Brass bar 2 =36. 000084 from comparison with Shuckburgh’s scale, 0-36 inch.
36. 000280 from comparison with Shuckburgh’s seale, 10-46 inch.
36. 000303 from comparison with the Ordnance yard, LA.

36. 000275 from comparison with the Ordnance yard, 2A.
36. 000229 from Captain Kater’s Royal Society yard.

Mean = 36. 000234
Respecting this mean Mr. Sheepshanks wrote: ‘This should be
pretty fear the truth; but I prefer 36.00025, if in such a matter such a
difference be worth notice. I propose, therefore, in constructing the
new standard to assume that— ;
* Brass bar 2= 36.00025 inches of lost Imperial standard at 62° Fahr.”

And upon that basis the standard now in use was constructed.*

Turning now to the French standards of length, it is known that the
ancient toise de magons of Paris was probably the toise of Charle-
magne (A. D. 742 to $14), or at least of some Emperor Charles, and
that its étalon was situated in the court-yard of the old Chatelet, on the
outside of one of the pillars of the building. It still existed in 1714,
but entirely falsified by the bending of the upper part of the pillar.
In 1668 the ancient toise of the masons was reformed by shortening it
five lines; but whether this reformation was an arbitrary change, or
merely a change to remedy the effects of long use and restore the étalon
to conformity with some more carefully preserved standard, is not
quite clear.t These old étalons were iron bars having their two ends
turned up at right angles so as to form talons, and the standardizing of
end measures was effected by fitting them between the talons. Being
placed on the outside of some public building, they were exposed to
wear from constant use, to rust, and even to intentional injury by ma-

606 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

licious persons. Under such conditions every étalon would sooner or
later become too long and require shortening.

Respecting the ancient toise of the masons there are two contradict.
ory stories. On December 1, 1714, La Hire showed to the French
Academy what he characterized as “a very ancient instrument of
mathematics, which has been made by one of our most accomplished
workinen with very great care, where the foot is marked, and which has
served to re-establish the toise of the Chatelet, as I have been informed
by our old mathematicians.”* Forty-four years later, on July 29, 1758,
La Condamine stated to the Academy that ‘‘ We know only by tradition
that to adjust the length of the new standard, the width of the arcade
or interior gate of the grand pavilion, which served as an entrance
to the old Louvre, on the side of the rue Fromenteau, was used. This
opening, according to the plan, should have been twelve feet wide. Half
of it was taken to fix the length of the new toise, which thus became
five lines shorter than the old one.”t Of these two contradictory state-
ments that of La Hire seems altogether most trustworthy, and the
ordinary rules of evidence indicate that it should be accepted to the
exclusion of the other.

In 1668 the étalon of the new toise, since known as the toise-étalon
du Chatelet, was fixed against the wall at the foot of the staircase of
the grand Chatelet de Paris, by whom or at what season of the year
is not known. Strange as it now seems, this standard (very roughly
made, exposed in a public place for use or abuse by everybody,
liable to rust, and certain to be falsified by constant wear) was actually
used for adjusting the toise of Picard, that of Cassini, the toise of Peru
and of the North, that of La Caille, that of Mairan—in short, all the
toises employed by the French in their geodetic operations during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The lack of any other recog-
nized standard made the use of this one imperative; but the French
academicians were well aware of its defects and took precautions to
guard against them.

The first toise copied from the étalon of the Chatelet for scientific
purposes was that used by Picard in his measurement of a degree of
the meridian between Paris and Amiens.¢ It was made about the
year 1668, and would doubtless have become the scientific standard of
France had it not unfortunately disappeared before the degree measure-
ments of the eighteenth century were begun. The second toise copied
from the étalon of the Chatelet for scientific purposes was that used by
Messrs. Godin, Bouguer, and La Condamine for measuring the base of
their are of the meridian in Peru. This toise, since known as the totse
du Pérou, was made by the artist Langlois under the immediate direc-
tion of Godin in 1735, and is still preserved at the Paris Observatory.§
It is a rectangular bar of polished wrought-iron, having a breadth of
1.58 English inches and a thickness of 0.30 of an inch. All the other .

toises used by the Academy in the eighteenth century, were compared
with it, and ultimately it was made the legal standard of France by
an order of Louis XV, dated May 16,1766. As the toise of Peru is the
oldest authentic copy of the toise of the Chatelet, the effect of this order
was simply to perpetuate the earliest known state of that ancient
standard.

The metric system originated from a motion made by Talieyrand in
the National Assembly of France, in 1790, referring the question of the
formation of an improved system of weights and measures, based upon
a natural constant, to the French Academy of Sciences; and the prelim-
inary work was intrusted to five of the most eminent members of that
Academy,—namely, Lagrange, Laplace, Borda, Monge, and Condorcet.
On March 19, 1791, these gentlemen, together with Lalande, presented
to the Academy a report containing the complete scheme of the metric
system. In pursuance of the recommendations in that report the law
of March 26, 1791, was enacted for the construction of the new system,
and the Academy of Sciences was charged with the direction of the
necessary operations. Those requisite for the construction of a standard
of length were:

(1) The determination of the difference of latitude between- Dunkirk
and Barcelona.

(2) The re-measurement of the ancient bases which had served for
the measurement of a degree at the latitude of Paris, and for making
the map of France.

(3) The verification by new observations of the series of triangles em-
ployed for measuring the meridan, and the prolongation of them as far
as Barcelona.

This work was intrusted to Méchain and Delambre, who carried it
on during the seven years from 1791 to 1798, notwithstanding many
great difficulties and dangers. The unit of length adopted in their
operations was the toise of Peru, and from the are of 9° 40! 45” actually
measured, they inferred the length of an are of the meridian extending
from the equator to the pole to be 5,130,740 toises. As the meter was
to be one ten millionth of that distance, its length was made 0.5130740
of a toise, or, in the language of the committee, 443.296 lines of the toise
of Peru at a temperature of 13° Reaumur (164° C. or 614° Falir.).*

Before attempting to estimate how accurately the standards we have
been considering were inter-compared it will be well to describe briefly
the methods by which the comparisons were effected. In 1742 Graham
used the only instruments then known for the purpose,—namely, very
exact beam compasses of various kinds, one having parallel jaws for
taking the lengths of the standard rods, another with rounded ends for
taking the lengths of the hollow beds, and still another having fine
points in the usual manner. The jaws, or points, of all these instru-
ments were movable by micrometer screws having heads divided to show

608 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

the eight hundredth part of an inch directly, and the tenth of that
juantity by estimation; but Mr. Graham did not consider that the
measurements could be depended upon to a greater accuracy than one
sixteen-hundredth of an inch.*

Troughton is generally regarded as the author of the application of
micrometer microscopes to the comparison of standards of length, but
the earliest record of their use for that purpose is by Sir George
Shuckburgh in his work for the improvement of the standards of
weight and measure, in 1796—’98.t Since then their use has been gen-
eral; first, because they are more accurate than beam compasses, and
second, because they avoid the injury to standard scales which neces-
sarily results from placing the points of beam compasses upon their
graduations. As the objective of the microscope forms a magnified
image of the standard, upon which the micrometer wires are set by the
aid of the eye-piece, it is evident that in order to reduce the effect of
imperfections in the micrometer, the objective should have the largest
practicable magnifying power. To show the progress in that direction
the optical constants of the microscopes, by means of which some of the
most important standards have been compared, are given in the accom-
panying table:

NOTE. _The ee aarine power of Sir Goande Sheek hunont s microscope seems to be
referred to a distance of 12 inches for distinct vision. The powers inclosed in paren-
theses are estimated upon the assumption that the respective micrometer screws had
one hundred threads per inch.

In the memoirs of the French Academy, nothing is said respecting the
method adopted by the Academicians for comparing their various toises ;
but in his astronomy, Lalande states that the comparisons were effected
partly by beam compasses, and partly by superposing the toises upon
each other and examining their ends, both by touch and with magnify-
ing-glasses; they being all end standards.¢ For the definitive adjust-
ment of the length of their meters, which were also end standards, the
French Metric ¢ Commission used a lever comparator by Lenoir.

THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING 609

In 1742 Graham used beam compasses, which he considered trust-
worthy to 0.00062 of an inch, in comparing standards of length; but at
that time the French Academicians made their comparisons of toises
only to one twentieth or one thirtieth of a line, say 0.00300 of an inch,
and it was not until 1758 that La Condamine declared they should be
compared to 0.01 of a line, or 0.00089 of an English inch ‘*if our senses
aided by the most perfect instruments can attain to that.”* Half a
century later, ten times that accuracy was attained by the lever com-
parator of Lenoir, which was regarded as trustworthy to 0.000077 of an
ineh.t

The heads of micrometer microscopes are usually divided into one
hundred equal parts, and if we regard one of these parts as the least
reading of a microscope, then in 1797, Sir George Shuckburgh’s micro-
scopes read to one ten thousandth of an inch; and the least reading
of microscopes made since that date has varied from one twenty thou-
sandth to one thirty-five thousandth of an inch. <A few investigators,
among whom may be mentioned Prof. W. A. Rogers, of Colby Uni-
versity, have made the least reading of their microscopes as small as
one ninety thousandth of an inch, but it is doubtful if there is any ad-
vantage in so doing. At the present day the errors committed in com-
paring standards arise, not from lack of power in the microscopes, but
from the difficulty of determining sufficiently exactly the temperature
of the standard bars, and the effect of flexure upon the position of their
graduations. In order to ascertain the length of athree-foot standard
with an error not exceeding 0.000020 of an inch, its temperature must
be known to 0.06° Fahr. if it is of brass, or to 0.09° Fah. if it is of iron.
To get thermometers that will indicate their own temperature to that
degree of accuracy is by no means easy, but to determine the tempera-
ture of a bar from their readings is far more difficult. Again, we im-
agine the length of our standards to follow their temperature rigorously,
but what proof is there that such is the case? If we determine the
freezing point of an old thermometer, then raise it to the temperature
of boiling water, and immediately thereafter again determine its freez-
ing point, we invariably find that the freezing point has fallen a little;
and we explain this by saying that the glass has taken a set, from which it
requires time to recover. Is it not probable that an effect similar in
kind, although less in degree, occurs in all solids when their tempera-
ture is varying? When we look at the highly polished terminals of
an end standard we are apt to regard them as mathematical surfaces,
separated by an interval which is perfectly definite, and which could
be measured with infinite precision if we only had the necessary instru-
mental appliances; but is that a correct view? The atomic theory
answers emphatically, No. According to it, all matter consists of
atoms, or molecules, of a perfectly definite size, and with definite inter-

vals between them; but even if that is denied, the evidence is now
overwhelming that matter is not homogeneous, but possesses a grain
of some kind, regularly repeated at intervals which can not be greater
than one two millionth nor less than one four-hundred millionth of an
inch. Accordingly, we must picture our standard bar as a conglomer-
ation of grains of some kind or other, having magnitudes of the order
specified, and all in ceaseless motion, the amplitude of which depends
upon the temperature of the bar. To our mental vision the polished
terminals are therefore like the surface of a pot of boiling water, and
we recognize that there must be a limit to the accuracy with which the
interval between them can be measured. As a basis for estimating
how near this limit we have approached it will suffice to say that for
fifty years past it has been customary to state comparisons of standards
of length to one one-millionth of an inch. Nevertheless, most authori-
ties agree that although one one-hundred thousandth of an inch can
be distinguished in the comparators, one twenty-five thousandth of an
inch is about the limit of accuracy attainable in comparing standards.
Possibly such a limit may be reached under the most favorable cireum-
stances, but in the case of the yard and the meter, which are standard
at different temperatures, the following values of the meter by observers
of the highest repute render it doubtful if anything like that accuracy
has yet been attained.*

The earliest standard of English weight of which we have any very
definite knowledge is the mint pound of the Tower of London. It
weighed 5,400 troy grains, and the coinage was regulated by it up to
the year 1527, when it was abolished in favor of the troy pound of
5,760 grains. Contemporaneously with the tower pound there was also
the merchant’s pound, whose exact weight is now involved in so much
doubt that it is impossible to decide whether it consisted of 6,750 or of
7,200 grains. The tower pound and the troy pound were used for
weighing only gold, silver, and drugs, while all other commodities were
weighed by the merchant’s pound until the thirteenth or fourteenth
century, and after that by the avoirdupois pound. It is not certainly
known when the troy and avoirdupois pounds were introduced into
England, and there is no evidence of any relation between them when
they first became standards. The present avoirdupois pound can be
clearly proved to be of similar weight to the standard avoirdupois pound
of Edward III (A. D. 1327-1377), and there is good reason for believing
that no substantial change has occurred either in its weight or in that
of the troy pound since their respective establishment as standards in
England.

*See Note C, at the end of the Address,
THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 611

The oldest standard weights now existing in the Englisharchives date
from the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and consist of a set of bell-shaped
avoirdupois weights of 56, 28, and 14 pounds, made in 1582, and 7, 4, 2,
and 1 pounds, made in 1588; a set of flat circular avoirdupois weights
of 8, 4, 2, and 1 pounds, ani 8, 4, 2, 1, $, 4, $, and ;4; ounces, made in
1588; and a set of cup-shaped troy weights, fitting one within the
other, of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2,1, 4, 4, 4 (hollow), and 4 (solid)
ounces, also made in 1588.* All these standards were constructed by
order of Queen Elizabeth, under the direction of a jury composed of
eighteen merchants and eleven goldsmiths of London; the avoirdupois
weights being adjusted according to an ancient standard of 56 pounds,
remaining in the Exchequer from the time of Edward III; and the
troy weights being adjusted according to the ancient standard in Gold-
smiths’ Hall.t

In view of the fact that the weight mentioned in all the old acts of
Parliament from the time of Edward I (A. D. 1274-1307) is universally
admitted to be troy weight, the Parliamentary Committee of 1758,
appointed to inquire into the original standards of weights and meas-
ures in England, recommended that the troy pound should be made the
unit or standard by which the avoirdupois and. other weights should be
regulated; and by their order three several troy pounds of soft gun metal
were very carefully adjusted under the direction of Mr. Joseph Harris,
who was then assay master of the mint. To ascertain the proper mass
for these pounds the committee caused Messrs. Harris and Gregory, of
the mint, to perform the following operations in their presence: t

First. In the before-mentioned set of troy weights, made in 1588,
which were then the Exchequer standard, each weight, from that of 4
ounces up to that of 256 ounces, was compared successively with the
sum of all the smaller weights ; and by a process for which no valid
reason can be assigned § it was concluded from these weighings that the
troy pound composed of the 8 and 4 ounce weights was 14 grains too
light.

Second. The aforesaid 8 and 4 ounce weights of the Exchequer were
compared with five other authoritative troy pounds, four of which be-
longed to the mint and one to Mr. Freeman, who, like his father before
him, was scale-maker to the mint, and from the mean of these weigh-
ings it appeared that the sum of the Exchequer 8 and 4 ounce weights
was one grain too light.

The committee adopted the mean between the latter result and that
which they had deduced from the Exchequer weights alone,§ and ac-
cordingly Mr. Harris made each of his three troy pounds 14 grains
heavier than the sum of the Exchequer 8 and 4 ounce weights; but
sixty-six years were destined to elapse before Parliament took action
respecting them.

612 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

The commissioners appointed in 1818 to establish a more uniform sys-
tem of weights and measures repeated the recommendations of the
committee of 1758,* and as the avoirdupois pound which had long been
used, although not legalized by any act of the legislature, was very
nearly 7,000 troy grains, they recommended that 7,000 such troy grains
be declared to constitute a pound avoirdupois.t These recommenda-
tions were embodied in the act of Parliament of June 17, 1824, and thus
one of the troy pounds made in 1758 became the Imperial standard.
That standard, like Bird’s standard yard, was deposited in the Houses
of Parliament and was burned up with them in October, 1834.

The present English standard pound was made in 184446 by Prof.
_ W. 4H. Miller, who was one of the members of the commission ap-
pointed in 1843 to superintend the construction of the new Parliament-
ary standards of length and weight destined to replace those destroyed
in 1834. A number of weights had been very accurately compared with
the lost standard; namely, in 1824 or 1825, by Captain Kater, five troy
pounds of gun metal, destined respectively for the use of the Ex-
chequer, the Royal Mint, and the cities of London, Edinburgh, and Dub-
lin; and in 1829, by Captain v. Nehus, two troy pounds of brass and one
of platinum, all in the custody of Professor Schumacher, and a platinum
troy pound belonging to the Royal Society. The first step for recover-
ing the mass of the lost standard was manifestly to compare these
weights among themselves, and upon so doing it was found that for the
brass and gun-metal weights the discrepancies between the weighings
made in 1824 and 1844 amounted to 0.0226 of a grain,t while for the
two platinum weights the discrepancies between the weighings made in
1829 and 1845 was only 0.00019 of a grain.§ With a single exception,
all the new brass or gun-metal weights had become heavier since their
first comparison with the lost standard, the change being probably due
to oxidation of their surfaces, and on that account the new standard
was made to depend solely upon the two platinum weights. For con-
venience of reference these weights were designated, respectively, Sp
(Schumacher’s platinum) and RS (Royal Society). A provisional
platinum troy pound, T, intermediate in mass between Sp and RS, was
next prepared, and from two hundred and eighty-six comparisons made
in January, February, July, and August, 1845, it was found that in a
vacuum||

T=Sp + 0.00105 grain,
while from 122 comparisons made in January, July, and August, 1845,
T=RS — 0.00429 grain.

By combining these values with the results of the weighings made in

1824-’29, namely,

Sp =U — 0.52956 grain,
RS = U — 0.52441 grain,

where U designates the lost standard—the comparison with Sp gave
T = U — 0.52851 grain,

THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 613

while those with RS gave
T = U — 0.52870 grain.

To the first of these expressions double weight was assigued, because
the comparisons of T and U with Sp were about twice as numerous as
those with RS. The resulting mean was therefore

T = U — 0.52857 grains = 5759.47143 grains,
and from that value of T the new standard avoirdupois pound of 7,000
grains was constructed.

From sometime in the fifteenth century until the adoption of the
metric system in August, 1793, the system of weights employed in
France was the poids de marc, having for its ultimate standard the pile
de Charlemagne, which was then kept in the mint, and is now deposited
in the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. The table of this weight was

Grains.
72 grains =1 gros = 72
8 gros =1 once = 576

8 onces = 1 marc — 4608

The origin of the pile de Charlemagne is not certainly known, but it is
thought to have been made by direction of King John (A.D. 1350-1364).
It consists of a set of brass cup-weights, fitting one within the other,
and the whole weighing fifty mares. The nominal and actual weights
of the several pieces are as follows: *

In determining the relation of the poids de marc to the metric weights,
the committee for the construction of the kilogram regarded the entire
pile de Charlemagne as a standard of fifty mares, and considered the
individual pieces as subject to the corrections stated. On that basis
they found

1 kilogram = 18827.15 French grains t
and, as a kilogram is equal to 15452.34874 English troy grains,{ we
have
1 livre, poids de mare = 7554.22 troy grains.
= 489.506 grams.

The metric standard of weight, called a kilogram, was constructed
under the direction of the French Academy of Sciences simultaneously
with the meter, the work being done principally by Lefévre-Gineau
and Borda. It was intended that the kilogram should have the same

mass as a cubic decimeter of pure water at maximum density, and the
experimental determination of that mass was made by finding the differ-
ence of weight in air and in water of a hollow brass cylinder
whose exterior dimensions at a temperature of 17.6° C. were, height
= 2.437672 decimeters, diameter = 2.428368 decimeters, volume
= 11.2900054 eubic decimeters. The difference of weight in question
was first measured in terms of certain brass weights, by the aid of
which the platinum kilogram of the archives was subsequently con-
structed, special care being taken to apply the corrections necessary
to reduce all the weighings to what they would have been if made in a
vacuum.*

The best results hitherto obtained for the weight of a cubic decimeter
of water, expressed in terms of the kilogram of the archives, are as

These results show the extreme difficulty of determining the exact
mass of a given volume of water. The discordance between the differ-
ent observers amounts to more than one part in a thousand, while good
weighings are exact to one part in eight or ten millions. Without
doubt two weights can be compared at least a thousand times more
accurately than either of them can be reproduced by weighing a speci-
fied volume of water, and for that reason the kilogram, like the En-
glish pound, can now be regarded only as an arbitrary standard of
which copies must be taken by direct comparison. As already stated,
the kilogram is equivalent to 15432.34874 English troy grains, or about
2 pounds 3 ounces avoirdupois.

In consequence of the circumstance that the mass of a body is not
affected either by temperature or flexure, weighing is an easier process
than measuring; but in order to obtain precise results many precau-
tions are necessary. Imagine a balance with a block of wood tied to
its right-hand pan and accurately counterpoised by lead weights in its
left-hand pan. If with things so arranged the balance were immersed
in water the equilibrium would be instantly destroyed, and to restore

t This table has been deduced from the data given by Professor Miller in 44, p. 760,
THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 615

it all the weights would have to be removed from the left-hand pan,
and some of them would have to be placed in the right-hand pan to
overcome the buoyancy of the wood. The atmosphere behaves pre-
cisely as the water does, and although its effect is minute enough to be
neglected in ordinary business affairs, it must be taken into account
when scientific accuracy is desired. To that end the weighing must
either be made in a vacuum, or the difference of the buoyant effect of
the air upon the substances in the two pans must be computed and
allowed for. As very few vacuum balances exist, the latter method is
usually employed. The data necessary for the computation are the
latitude of the place where the weighing is made and its altitude above
the sea-level; the weights, specific gravities, and co-efficients of expan-
sion of each of the substances in the two pans; the temperature of the
air, its barometric pressure, and the pressure, both of the aqueous va-
por, and of the carbonic anhydride contained in it.

Judging from the adjustment of the pile de Charlemagne, and the
Exchequer troy weights of Queen Elizabeth, the accuracy attained
in weighing gold and silver at the mints during the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries must have beea about one part in
ten thousand. The balance which Mr. Harris of the London mint used
in 1743 indicated one-eighth of a grain on a troy pound, or about one
part in 50,000; while that which be and Mr. Bird used in their observa-
tions upon the Exchequer weights, for the Parliamentary Committee
of 1759, was sufficiently exact ‘‘ to discern any error in the pound weight
to the 230,400th part of the weight..* In 1798 Sir George Shuckburgh
had a balance sensitive enough to indicate 0.01 of « grain when loaded
with 16,000 grains, or about one part in 1,600,000. The balance used
by Fortin in 1799, in adjusting the kilogram of the archives, was not
quite so delicate, its sensitiveness being only the one-millionth part of
its load; but in 1844, for the adjustment of the present English stand-
ard pound, Professor Miller employed a balance whose index moved
about 0.01 of an inch for a change of 0.002 of a grain in a load of 7,000
grains.t He read the index with a microscope, and found the probable
error of a single comparison of two avoirdupois pounds to be one twelve-
millionth of either, or about 0.00058 of a grain. At the present time it
is claimed that two avoirdupois pounds cén be compared with an error
not exceedizg 0.0002 of a grain; and two kilograms with an error not
exceeding 0.02 of a milligram.

The mean solar day is the natural unit of time for the human race,
and it is universally adopted among all civilized nations. Our ulti-
mate standard of time is therefore the rotation of the earth upon its
axis, and from that rotation we determine the errors of our clocks and
watches by astronomical observations. For many purposes it suffices
to make these observations upon the sun, but when the utmost precis-
ion is desired it is better to make them on the stars. Until the close

of the seventeenth century quadrants were employed for that purpose,
and so late as 1680 Flamsteed, the first English astronomer royal,thought
himself fortunate when he succeeded in construting one which enabled
him to be sure of his observed times within three seconds.* About
1690 Roemer invented the transit instrument, which soon superseded
the quadrant, and still remains the best appliance for determining time.
Most of his observations were destroyed by a fire in 1728, but the
few which have come down to us show that as early as 1706 he deter-
mined time with an accuracy which has not yet been very greatly sur-
passed. Probably the corrections found in the least square adjustment
of extensive systems of longitude determinations afford the best crite-
rion for estimating the accuracy of first-class modern time observations,
and from them it appears that the error of such observations may rise
as high as + 0.05 of a second.

During the intervals between successive observations of the heay-
enly bodies we necessarily depend upon clocks and chronometers for
our knowledge of the time, and very erroneous ideas are frequently
entertained respecting the accuracy of their running. The subject is
one upon which it is difficult to obtain exact information, but there are
few time-pieces which will run for a week without varying more than
three-quarters of a second from their predicted error. As the number
of seconds in a week is 604,800, this amounts to saying that the best
time-pieces can be trusted to measure a week within one part in 756,000.
Nevertheless, clocks and chronometers are but adjuncts to our chief
time-piece, which is the earth itself, and upon the constancy of its ro-
tation depends the preservation of our present unit of time. Early in
this century Laplace and Poisson were believed to have proved that
the length of the sidereal day had not changed by so much as the one
hundredth part of a second during the last twenty-five hundred years,
but later investigations show that they were mistaken, and so far as
we can now see, the friction produced by the tides in the ocean must be
steadily reducing the velocity with which the earth rotates about its
axis. The change is too slow to become sensible within the life-time of
a human being, but its ultimate consequences will be momentous.

Ages ago it was remarked that all things run in cycles, and there is
enough truth in the saying to make it as applicable now as on the day
it was uttered. The Babylonian or Chaldean system of weights and
measures seems to be the original from which the Egyptian system was
derived, and is probably the most ancient of which we have any knowl-
edge. Its unit of length was the cubit, of which there were two varie-
ties, the natural and the royal. The foot was two-thirds of the natural
cubit. Respecting the earliest Chaldean and Egyptian system of
weights no very satisfactory information exists, but the best authori-
ties agree that the weight of water contained in the measure of a cubic

foot constituted the talent, or larger unit of weight, and that the six-.
tieth or fiftieth parts of the talent constituted, respectively, the Chal-
dean and Egyptian values of the mina, or lesser unit of commercial
weight. Doubtless these weights varied considerably at different times
and places, just as the modern pound has varied, but the relations stated
are believed to have been the original ones. The ancient Chaldeans
used not only the decimal system of notation, which is evidently the
primitive one, but also a duodecimal system, as shown by the division
of the year into twelve months, the equinoctial day and night each into
twelve hours, the zodiac into twelve signs, etc., and a sexagesimal sys-
tem by which the hour was divided into sixty minutes, the signs of the
zodiac into thirty parts or degrees, and the circle into three hundred
and sixty degrees, with further sexagesimal subdivisions. The duo-
decimal and sexagesimal systems seem to have originated with the
Chaldean astronomers, who, for some reason which is not now evident,
preferred them to the decimal system, and by the weight of their scien-
tific authority impressed them upon their system of weights and
measures. Now observe how closely the scientific thought of to-day
repeats the scientific thought of four thousand years ago. These old
Chaldeans took from the human body what they regarded as a suitable
unit of length, and for their unit of mass they adopted a cube of water
bearing simple relations to their unit of length. Four thousand years
later, when these simple relations had been forgotten and impaired,
some of the most eminent scientists of the last century again undertook
the task of constructing a system of weights and measures. With
them the duodecimal and sexagesimal systems were out of favor, while
the decimal system was highly fashionable, and for that reason they
subdivided their units decimally instead of duodecimally, sexagesi-
mally, or by powers of two; but they reverted to the old Chaldean
device for obtaining simple relations between their units of length and
mass, and to that fact alone the French metric system owes its survival.
Every one now knows that the meter is not the ten-millionth part of a
quadrant of the earth’s meridian, and in mathematical physics, where
the numbers are all so complicated that they can only be dealt with by
the aid of logarithms, and the constant z, an utterly irrational quantity,
crops up in almost every integral, mere decimal subdivision of the units
counts for very little. But in some departments of science, as, for
example, chemistry, a simple relation between the unit of length (which
determines volume), the unit of mass, and the unit of specific gravity is
of prime importance, and wherever that is the case the metric system will
be used. To engineers such relations are of small moment, and conse-
quently among English-speaking engineers the metric system is making
no progress, while, on the other hand, the chemists have eagerly adopted
it. As the English yard and pound are the direct descendants of the
Chaldean-Babylonian natural ecubit and mina, it is not surprising that
the yard should be only 0.45 of an inch shorter than the double cubit,
618 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

and the avoirdupois pound only 665 grains lighter than the Babylonian
commercial mina; but, considering the origin of the metric system, it
is rather curious that the meter is only 1.97 inches shorter than the
Chaldean double royal cubit, and the kilogram only 102 grains heavier
than the Babylonian royal mina, Thus, without much exaggeration,
we may regard the present English and French fundamental units of
length and mass as representing, respectively, the commercial and royal
units of length and mass of the Chaldeans of four thousand years ago.

Science tells us that the energy of the solar system is being slowly
dissipated in the form of radiant heat; that ultimately the sun will grow
dim; life will die out on the planets; one by one they will tumble into
the expiring sun; and at last darkness and the bitter cold of the abso-
lute zero will reign over all. In that far-distant future imagine some
wandering human spirit to have penetrated to a part of space immeas-
urably beyond the range of our most powerful telescopes, and there,
upon an orb where the mechanical arts flourish as they do here, let him
be asked to reproduce the standards of length, mass, and time with
which we are now familiar. In the presence of such a demand the
science of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries would be power-
less. The spin of the earth which measures our days and nights would
be irretrievably gone; our yards, our meters, our pounds, our kilograms
would have tumbled with the earth into the ruins of the sun and _ be-
come part of the débris of the solar system. Could they be recovered
from the dead past and live again? The science of all previous ages
mournfully answers, No; but with the science of the nineteenth cen-
tury it is otherwise. The spectroscope has taught us that throughout
the visible universe the constitution of matter is the same. Everywhere
the rythmic motions of the atoms are absolutely identical, and to them,
and the light which they emit, our wandering spirit would turn for the
recovery of the long-lost standards. By means of a diffraction grating
and an accurate goniometer he could recover the yard from the wave
length of sodium light with an error not exceeding one or two thou-
sandths of aninch. Wateris everywhere, and with his newly recovered
yard he could measure a cubic foot of it, and thus recover the standard
of mass which we call a pound. The recovery of our standard of time
would be more difficult; but even that could be accomplished with an
error not exceeding half a minute in a day. One way would be to perform
Michelson’s modification of Foucault’s experiment for determining the
velocity of light. Another way would beto make a Siemen’s mercury
unit of electrical resistance, and then, either by the British Association
method or by Lord Rayleigh’s modification of Lorenz’s method, find the
velocity which measures its resistance in absolute units. Still another
way would be to find the ratio of the electro-static and electro-magnetic
units of electricity. Thus all the units now used in transacting the
world’s business could be made to re-appear, if not with scientific, at
least with commercial, accuracy, on the other side of an abyss of time
THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 619

and space before which the human mind shrinks back in dismay. The
science of the eighteenth century sought to render itself immortal by
basing its standard units upon the solid earth, but the science of the
nineteenth century soars far beyond the solar system and connects its
units with the ultimate atoms which constitute the universe itself.

By direction of the Parliamentary Committee of 17 58, and in the pres-
ence both of that body and of Mr. Farley, deputy chamberlain, Messrs.
Harris and Gregory, of the London mint, compared the several stand-

ard troy weights of the Exchequer, with the following results:
¢ grain.
4 grain.

4-ounce weight = Ali smaller weights —
8-ounce weight = All smaller weights +-
16-ounce weight = All smaller weights +
32-ounce weight — All smaller weights +-
64-ounce weight = All smaller weights +

128-ounce weight = All smaller weights + 14 grains.
256-ounce weight = All smaller weights — 21] grains.

The weighings which yielded these results were made at the London
mint; the instruments employed being ‘a very curious and exact pair
of scales, belonging to Mr. Harris, and the scales used at the Mint

the committee continued as follows:

Therefore beginning the Difference from the sixteen Ounce Weight,
and carrying it on to the greatest Troy Weight in the Exchequer, the
total Difference will be eight Grains and one-half.

The fourth Part of which is two Grains upon sixteen Ounces, which
is a Grain and a half upon the twelve Ounces or Pound Troy.

* 13, p. 437.

After recording the results in their report *

622 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

Then the eight and four Ounces Troy of the Exchequer were com-
pared with the following Weights: :
First, With the Pound Troy used at the Mint in weighing of Goid,

which was heavier than that at the Exchequer one Grain.

Secondly, With the eight and four Ounces at the Mint of the 6th of
Queen Anne, 1707, which was heavier than that at the Exchequer
half a Grain.

The eight and four Ounces of Queen Elizabeth 1588 at the Mint, was
heavier than that at the Exchequer three Quarters of a Grain;
another of the same Year of Queen Elizabeth at the Mint, stampt
with a Tower, a Thistle and Crown, and EL and Crown, was heavier
than that at the Exchequer one Grain.

Mr. Freeman produced a four and eight Ounce of the 6th of Queen
Anne 1707, by which he makes Weights for Sale, which was heavier
than the same Weights at the Exchequer one Grain and three Quarters:
Therefore, upon an Average of all these Weights, the Pound Troy
should be one Grain heavier than the Weights at the Exchequer, and
that added to the Grain and a half, which, upon the former Experi-
ments, the Weights at the Exchequer are too light a Medium taken
from thence, makes the proper Increase of the Exchequer Pound Troy
to be one Grain and one Quarter.

And it is to be observed, that the Pound Troy Weight at the Mint,
which is now used for Gold, and the eight and four Ounces at the Mint,
marked with a Tower, and in the Time of Queen Elizabeth, are both
one Grain heavier than the eight and four Ounces of the Exchequer.

And considering that the Exchequer Weights have been used ever
since the 30th of Queen Hlizabeth, 1588, one hundred and seventy Years,
to size other Weights by, it is highly probable, that the Difference may
have been oceasioned by the frequent Use of the Standard.

Your Committee endeavored to compare the Troy Weights with the
original Standard at Goldsmith’s Hall, from whence it is said, in the
aforesaid Verdict of the 29th and 30th of Elizabeth, that the Weights
now at the Exchequer were made, and for that Purpose sent to Gold-
smith’s Hall for the said Weights; but were informed that no such
were to be found there, the Goldsmiths having no Weights older than
those at the Exchequer.

The committee’s statement respecting the way in which the correc-
tion of 14 grains was deduced from the weighings of the Exchequer
weights is very obscure, and the result is not justified by generally ac-
cepted principles. If we put # for the sum of all the weights smaller
than 4 ounces, then the results of the weighings made by the committee
may be written in the form:

4 ounce divided = 1a et fel

4 ounce weight — 12% — # grain. |

8 ounce weight — 2% -+ ¢ grain.

16 ounce weight = 4%” +4 4 grain. | ae
32 ounce weight = #8 # + 24 grains. { é
64 ounce weight —= 16 a + 5} grains. |
128 ounce weight = 32 x 4 22 grains.
256 ounce weight = 64a“-+ 9 grains. J

Before proceeding further we must decide in what sense these weights
are to be regarded as standards, and perhaps the most natural course
THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 623

will be to regard the entire set as a standard of 512 troy ounces. In
that case the summation of the several columns gives
512 ounces = 128 x + 39 grains.
whence
x = 4 ounces — 0.3047 grain (2)
and by substituting that value in the equations (1) we obtain the cor-
rections to the several weights given in the second column of Table I.

From equations (1) and (2) we have

4 ounces = 4-0z. weight + 0.5547 grain.
8 ounces = 8-oz. weight + 0.3594 grain.

whence it follows that the sum of the 8 and 4 ounce weights, which
constituted the Exchequer standard troy pound, was too light by
0.9141 of a grain. As the mean correction obtained from the four
weights belonging respectively to the Mint and to Mr. Freeman, agrees
closely with this result, the true correction to the Exchequer standard
must have been very approximataly 1 grain; and in adopting 14
grains the committee seem to have augmented the weight of the troy
pound by about one-quarter of a grain. The corrections which result
to the Exchequer troy weights upon the committee’s assumption that
the sum of the 8 and 4 ounce weights was 14 grains too light are given
in the third column of Table I; while the fourth column contains the
corrections found by Mr. Chisholm in 1873, * and the fifth column shows
the loss of weight which occurred between 1758 and 1873. In view of
the fact that these weights were constantly used for comparing local
Standards during a period.of no less than two hundred and thirty-seven
years, from 1588 to 1825, their excellent preservation is very remarkable.

In the report of the committee of 1758 there is another set of com-
parisons of the Exchequer troy weights,+ said comparisons having
been made on April L4, 1758, in accordance with the directions of

the committee, by Mr. Freeman and Mr. Reed, expert scale-makers, in

the presence of Mr. Farley,

deputy chamberlain.

They are as follows:

4-ounce hollow = 4-ounce solid + 4 grain.

d-ounce weight — All smaller
4-ounce weight = All smaller
l-ounce weight = All smaller
2-ounce weight = All smaller
4-ounce weight = All smaller
8-ounce weight = All smaller
16-ounce weight — All smaller
32-ounce weight = All smaller
64-ounce weight — All smaller

weights — 3 grain.

weights -++ 0 grains.”
weights + 0 grains.
weights — 2 grains.
weights + 0 grains.
weights + 15 grains.
weights — 24 grains.

In these equations the symbol + 0 is used to indicate the relation
which the committee expressed by saying that the weights ‘very
nearly agreed.”

Regarding the entire set of weights as a standard of 512 ounces,
and putting # for the mass of the 4-0z. solid weight we have

4-ounce solid = ila
4-ounce hollow = lx + 4 grain.
4-ounce weight = —_ 2x.
4-ounce weight = 4x.
l-ounce weight = 8a.
2-ounce weight = 162.

4-ounce weight — 32x” -+ 4 ¢rain. (3)
8-ounce weight — 64x + 1 grain.
16-ounce weight — 128% + 2 grains.
32-ounce weight = 56x + 2 grains.
64-ounce weight = 512x% + 6 grains.
128-ounce weight = 1024” + 27 grains.
256-ounce weight = 2048x +- 15 grains.
Summing the various columns
512 ounces = 4096x +- 54 grains
whence
x = $ ounce — 0.01318 grains, (4)

and by substituting that value in the equations (3) we obtain the cor.
rections given for the several weights in the second column of Table IT.
The third column contains the corrections which result upon the com-
mittee’s assumption that the sum of the 8 and 4 ounce weights was 14
grains too light; and the fourth and fifth columns contain corrections
given by Mr. Chisholm in his seventh annual report.* Mr, Chisholm
* does not explain how he obtained the corrections quoted in the fourth
column of the table, but their close agreement with those in the third
column renders it almost certain that they were computed from the
comparisons made by Messrs Freeman and Reed. As the committee
of 1758 used Mr. Harris’s weighings to the exclusion of those by Messrs.
Freeman and Reed, the adoption of the opposite course by Mr. Chisholm
is perhaps explained by the circumstance that in his report on the Ex-
chequer standardst he has quoted the weighings by Messrs. Freeman and
Reed and has attributed them to Mr. Harris.

In addition to being less* exact, the weighings by Mr. Freeman
differ from those by Mr. Harris principally in the sign of the corree-
tion to the 32-ounce weight; the former stating that the 32-ounce
weight was lighter than the sum of all the smaller weights and the
latter that it was heavier. To ascertain which was right we have
oply to compare the resulting systems of corrections with those found
by Mr. Chisholm in 1873. Table I shows that according to Mr. Harris’s
weighings all the weights have grown lighter during the interval from
1758 to 1873, while Table II shows that according to Mr. Freeman’s
weighings some have grown lighter and others heavier, and that by
quantities which cannot be attributed to accidental errors in the weigh-
ings. In view of these facts there can be no doubt that the committee
of 1758 was right in using only Mr. Harris’s weighings, and it seems

-equally certain that the numbers in Table I should be adopted to the
exclusion of those in Table II.

From comparisons of their troy pound with their avoirdupois pound,
and with the 2-mare weight sent to them by the French Academy in
1742, the Royal Society of London found*—

(1) That the English avoirdupois pound weighed 7,004 troy grains:

(2) That the French livre, consisting of 2 mares, weighed 7,560
troy grains:

And for three-quarters of a century the latter value was universally
accepted. Further, when the metric system came into being the kilo-

*7, page 187. It is usual to designate 1742 as the date of the exchange of stand-
ards, but the remark of Cassini de Thury (5, p. 135) shows that the true date must
have been prior to April, 1733. In his paper of November, 1742, Graham makes only
the indefinite statement that the exchange was ‘‘ proposed some time since,”

626 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

gram was deelared to consist of 18,827.15 French grains, of which the
livre contained 9216; * or, in other words, the kilogram was deelared
equal to 2.04285 livres, whence, with the Royal Society’s value of the livre,
the English equivalent of the kilogram was computed to be 15,444 troy
grains.

During some experiments at the London mint in March, 1820, it was
found that the French livre belonging to that institution weighed only
7,555 troy grains. This discovery led to an examination of the Royal
Society’s standards of 1742, which had been carefully preserved, and it
was found that their livre agreed with that at the mint, but their Troy
pound was nearly 4 grains lighter than the Imperial standard of 1758,
and their avoirdupois pound weighed onty 7,000 troy grains instead of
7,004.4 Thus it was rendered almost certain that the accepted English
equivalent of the kilogram was about 10 grains too large, and, to remove
all possible doubt, a direct comparison of the English and French stand-
ards of weight was effected in 1821,¢ through the co-operation of the
respective governments, and then it was definitively ascertained that
the weight of the kilogram is only 15,433 troy grains.

The facts respecting the Royal Society’s standards of 1742 are as
follows:

(1) The weighings recorded in the Philosophical Transactions, 1743,
pages 553 and 556, give

R. 8S. troy pound = Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 4 grain (5)
hk. S. troy pound = Mint (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 23 grains (6)

whence
Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) = Mint (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 1f grains (7)

(2) The weighings by Mr. Harris for the Parliamentary Committee
of 1758 give §

Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) = Mint (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 4 grain (8)
whence by (6),
R. 8. troy pound — Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 1$ grains (9)

In equations (6) and (8) the weights at the mint were those of the
sixth of Queen Anne, 1707.

(5) In the Philosophical Transactions, 1742, page 187, it is stated that
the Paris 2-mare weight weighs 7560 troy grains. As the true weight
of 2 mares is 7554.22 grains, this implies that the Royal Society’s troy
pound was too light by 5.78 (5760 + 7560) = 4.40 grains.

In the Philosophical Transactions, 1742, page 187, it is stated that
the Royal Society’s avoirdupois pound weighed 7004 troy grains, while
the comparisons made in 1820 show that its weight was then only 7000
such grains. This implies that the Royal Society’s troy pound was too
light by 4.00 (5760 ~ 7000) = 3.29 grains.

Finally, the comparisons of 1820 showed that the Royal Society’s
troy pound was ‘nearly 4 grains too light.”

The mean of these three independent results shows that the Royal

* Base du Systém Métrique, T. 3, p. 638. { 31, pages 19-22.

THE ART OF WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 627

Society’s troy pound was 3.9 grains lighter than the Imperial standard
of 1758; whence

R. 8. troy pound + 3.9 grains = Standard of 1758 (10)
but
Standard of 1858 — Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) + 1} grains (11)
and therefore
R. 8. troy pound = Exch, (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 2§ grains (12)

Considering the indefiniteness of the data respecting the weighings
made in 1520, equations (9) and (12) agree fairly well, but equation (5)
is very discordant, as are also equations (7) and (8). All the evidence
seems to point to an error of about 14 grains in equation (5); and if
instead of (5) we write

: R. S. Troy pound = Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 2 grains (5')
(7) will become
Exch. (8 ounces + 4 ounces) = Mint (8 ounces + 4 ounces) — 2 grain (7')

and then all the equations will be reasonably accordant.

Assistant O. H. Tittmann, of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey,
in charge of weights and measures, has recently shown that the dis-
crepancies in the values assigned to the meter in terms of the yard
depend mainly upon errors either in the assumed lengths or in the
assumed coefficients of expansion of the standards employed.* By a
skillful use of the data published by the various observers, combined
with the known coefficient of expansion of the iron committee meter,
“OM,” of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, he has succeeded in
determining the absolute expansions of the standards in question, and
by means of these expansions he has referred all the observations to
the said committee meter and to the present British Imperial yard.
From the data thus reduced to a common standard he has obtained
the very consistent results given in the fourth column of the following
table. The values in the third column are those published by the ob-
servers themselves, and it is now evident that they really depend upon
several different British and metric units. As there is no means of re-
ferring the standard used by Prof. W. A. Rogers to the committee meter,
his result could not be included in the table.

DETERMINATION OF THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH
BY MEANS OF A PENDULUM PRINCIPLE.

By J. WILSING.
Translated and condensed by Prof. J. HowarD GorRE, Ph. D.*

Four different methods have been used in the determination of the
mean density of the earth. The first is based upon the measurement
of the deflection of the plumb-line in the neighborhood of great mount-
ain masses; the second upon the determination ot the length of the
second’s pendulum at various distances from the earth’s center. Accord-
ing to the third and fourth methods, the attraction of a body of known
mass, usually of a globular shape, is ascertained by means of the torsion
balance, or directly with an ordinary balance and compared with the
constants of gravity.

The first attempts towards the solution of this problem were by Mas-
kelyne, receiving a new discussion at the hand of Hutton a few years
later. Maskelyne’s results depended upon the measurement of the de-
flection of the plumb-line caused by the attraction of Schehallien, in
connection with an approximated value for the density of the moun-
tain. This estimated density, derived from the superficial strata alone,
was so subject to uncertainties that the result can be regarded as
nothing more than a rough approximation. Later and more general
investigations have shown that local deflection may arise from a variety
of co-existing or conspiring causes, so that the attraction of elevations can
be accounted for by the presence of depressions or interior defects in
the earth’s mass. In such a case, a value for the attracting mass which
is deduced from the exterior configuration alone, must lead to incorrect
results. Similar objections can be applied to the method of pendulum
swinging, which was made use of by Carlini and Airy, and more recently
by von Sterneck and Albrecht.

Hence the invention by Coulomb of the torsion balance and its ap-
plication by Cavendish to the problem in question marked a great
advance towards its accurate solution. The great sensitiveness of this
instrument makes its possible to render measurabie the attraction of
balls of a tew hundredweight, the mass of which can cantly be ascer-

tained by weighing, so that the determination of the density of the
earth enters into the realm of laboratory investigation. However, this
Sensitiveness which eliminates the uncertainty in the computation of
the attracting forces has, as a consequence, some disadvantages which
were first mentioned by Francis Baily while engaged upon the same
problem. These drawbacks consist chiefly of a limited inertia and sta-
bility against accidental disturbances, especially temperature changes
and the variations in the twisting force of the supporting thread. In
the interesting investigations of A. Cornu and J. B. Baille the disturb.
ances just referred to seem to have been essentially eliminated. Unfor-
tunately it is not possible to form an opinion regarding the accuracy of
the results from the short report that is given in Compt. Rend., 1878,
LXXXVI, pp. 699-702. At all events measurements with the torsion
balance must be regarded as especially difficult.

For this reason the fourth method, the determination by the means of
a balance of the change in weight of a body caused by the proximity of
a second body of known mass, has the preference. It is true, however,
that the ordinary balance is not sufficiently sensitive to measure the
attraction of bodies as small as those employed in the torsion balance.
Jolly, who first made use ot this method, utilized a ball of lead of 120
hundredweight. At this time Messrs. Kénig and Richarz are working
at Jolly’s method, using a parallelopiped block of lead of 2,000 hun-
dredweight. Since it is necessary to actually determine the weight of
these large bodies, a task rendered difficult on account of their size,
the measurement of their attraction requires the transposition of them
while being weighed. Jolly had four seale pans, two of which were
fastened below the others by a wire 21 meters long; he determined the
increase in the weight of a glass vessel filled with mercury which was
caused by its transfer to the lower scale pan under which was the at-
tracting ball of lead. This transfer caused a loss of time, and necessi-
tated a frequent stoppage of the balance, a condition which might seri-
ously affect the results since the change in the relative positions of
knife-edge and its resting place would bring about a deformity in the
former, causing a disturbance in the oscillation of the balance.

I have sought to overcome these difficulties by turning the instru-
ment through 90°, that is, by replacing for a horizontal balance a verti-
cal one or a pendulum whose knife-edge is above the center of gravity
aud very near to it, upon the hypothesis that the sensitiveness of the
apparatus could be materially increased if it forms a rigid system and
is protected from flexure by being supported with its length vertical.
Then it is possible to succeed with smaller and more easily handled
masses, and to prosecute the observations without difficulty while the
necessity to stop the instrument during the progress of the work is en-
tirely avoided. A trial apparatus was constructed in which the time of
oscillation was proionged to the desired extent, giving results so har-
monious that a final pendulum was completed in 1885 by Repsold.
- MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH. 637
DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS.

The pendulum consists of a drawn brass tube i“ long, 4.15°" in diam-
eter, and 0.16" thick, which is strengthened near its middle by means
ofaframe,C EF D. At this place are two mortises
on opposite sides of the tube, EF, rectangular in
shape, 9°" long and 2°" wide, for the insertion of the
resting place or bed L for the knife-edge S which is
firmly fastened to the pendulum. The upper portion
of this bed is a slightly concave piece of agate of 6°"
in length and 1° in width securely attached to the
supporting brass. The knife-edge, alsoof agate, has
the same length as its bed. Its cross-section is an
equilateral triangle with sides 1.7 long. The edge
is not perfectly sharp, and on account of the concav-
ity of the bed rests on it only near the end. The slits
just referred to serve as a guide to the knife-edge and
also admits the air into the interior of the tube so
that there may be a quick and equable response to
all temperature changes. The ends of the tube are
closed by means of brass caps which carry conical
pins. Upon these pins balls of brass, A, are attached
by means of screws. The pins are prolonged beyond
the balls and one of them carries three smail mova-
ble screws, N, whose determinations will be given
later; at the other end corresponding to this addi-
tional weight a brass disk of equal weight is screwed
on so that the symmetry of the apparatus is pre-
served. Through the upper end of the pendulum rod
perpendicular to the length of the knife-edge there is
a slender screw, G H, 7™ long, which serves in ad-
justing the position of the center of gravity. Di-
rectly before and behind the knife-edge circular mir-
rors of 3.5°" diameter are attached, with whose as-
sistance the swinging of the pendulum can be observed. In order to
avoid magnetic interferences, brass is used throughout the entire in-
strument.

DESCRIPTION OF THE OBSERVING-ROOM.

The observing-room, 4™ square, is situated in the basement of the
west wing of the observatory. As the walls are very thick and the
room, being on the southern side directly under the cupola, is protected
from the direct rays of the sun, the changes in the temperature are
very slight.

In the middle of the room there was a rigid pillar of brick with its
foundation 3 feet deep. On its south side is the cast-iron bracket which
supports the penduium, so arranged that when once placed in a perpen-
dicular position it can be securely held so. The whole is protected
638 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

from air disturbances by means of a wooden box covered with cloth
and fastened directly to the pillar. The front of the box can be taken
off, so. as to remove or replace the pendulum, while an opening, pro-
vided with a cover, in the top allows the weights to be moved at will.
On the sides in front of the mirrors, already described, are small square
windows closed with glass. Later this box was covered with a coat of
white lead.

The telescope with which the oscillations were observed had an open-
ing of 8 and 80°™ focal distance. It was fastened on a brick pillar in
communicating passage. The scale utilized in the observations was
on glass; it was 50° in length, and was placed at a distance of 500°"
from the mirror. The magnifying power of the telescope was such that
the tenth of a millimeter could be approximated, and after some prac-
tice the twentieth, a value which represented about a second of are.
The graduation error in the scale was never greater than 0.01™™.

THE ATTRACTING MASSES.

Until now balls of lead have been universally used. But on account
of the softness of lead it is almost impossible to secure a geometric
body homogeneous in its structure ; besides, the continued suspension
would bring about, through the action of gravity, deformities. For
these reasons, notwithstanding its small specific gravity, the preference
was given to cast-iron, and for practical convenience and the possibility
of a more exact figure the cylindrical shape was chosen. They were
cast under pressure, and upon a subsequent weighing and examination
for specific gravity they appeared practically identical.

These masses, each of which weighed 325 kilograms, were so hung by
a wire rope over a system of pulleys that they always balanced one an-
other, and could be easily moved, one up, the other down. The length
of the rope was so adjusted that when one of the cylinders was directly
opposite the upper end of the pendulum the other would be on the oppo-
site side and directly on a line with the lower end. In order to obviate
any lateral motion and consequent shaking, each cylinder was provided
with guiding rollers which ran up tracks attached to uprights, firmly
held in their proper places. This and similar precautions were so well
taken that during the entire series of observations no jarring was ob-
served.

ARRANGEMENT OF THE OBSERVATIONS.

When the pendulum was put in motion, before the cylinders were put
in place, it was noticed if the amplitude was bisected by the vertical
through the point of support. If not, the screw in the upper end, al-
ready referred to, was made use of, aided, if necessary, by a change in
the position of the thin plates on the top of the rod.

The position of equilibrium was next determined by placing, for in-
stance, the eastern weight near the upper end of the pendulum, observ-
ing a series of four consecutive elongations, then changing the weights,
observe another series of four elongations. Both series were, with few
MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH. 639

exceptions, separated from one another by a complete double swing.
The observations were repeated, so as to have two or three sets of four
readings for each day. The are of oscillation gradually decreased to a
fixed limit, since the series were so arranged that the transfer of the
weights could be made to follow that phase of oscillation in which the
change in the direction of the force causes a retardation of its motion.
The amplitude of the arc was between three degrees and a few minutes,
with about 45’ as an average.

With the determination of the position of equilibrium that of the du-
ration of the oscillation is closely allied. The time of the transit of a
division of the scale over the wire of the telescope could be estimated
within 0.1 second. These transits were usually observed on three divis-
ions. If the times of transits of the same phase were observed, the dif-
ference would give an approximate value for the time of a double oscilla-
tion; which, however, must be corrected for the decreased arc owing to
the resistance of the air.

For the reduction of the observations there is still needed a deter-
mination of the sensitiveness of the pendulum. Thisis also found from
the period of oscillation, by changing the position of the supplemental
weights attached to the upper end of the pendulum. Hach observed
period in combination with the normal period gave the moment of in-
ertia and the distance of the center of gravity from the knife-edge.

In all the observations a chronometer giving stellar time was used, and
was compared both before and after each series with the standard clock
of the observatory. Barometric readings were made, as well as those
for temperature, which were taken from thermometers placed in various
parts of the room.

Laplace noticed, and Bessel proved by experiments, that the shape of
the knife-edge supporting a pendulum exerted an appreciable effect
upon the period of oscillation and the diminution in the amplitude.
Since this period furnishes an important element in all reductions, it
was necessary to investigate the effect of the dulling of the knife-edge.
At the same time the resistance of the air and its resulting interference
were investigated.

The computation of the moment of inertia was divided into parts,
taking up first the moment for the mean position of the instrument as
previously determined, using in this connection the moment of a mate-
rial line coincident with the axis of the pendulum rod and perpendicu-
lar to the line joining the centers of the attracting masses. The at-
traction of the masses is:

2af'm g 6( V(a—h)P+ R?— V (a+h)?+ R24 2h)
in which mg is the weight of the ball, f a constant, 6, 2h, and R the
specific gravity, height, and radius of the cylinder, and a the distance
of the middle point of the ball to the center of the cylinder. © If / is the
distance of the center of the ball from the knife-edge, the moment will be:

2afmgdl (Va—h)?+R?— V(a+h)?+ R24 2h)
640 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

The effect of the screws and the rollers serving as guides for the
cylinders was next investigated and allowance therefor duly made,
likewise for snch other parts as were not of an eliminating character.
After making all corrections that presented themselves the result was
the desired moment for the normal position of the pendulum. The
next thing was to find what change was produced upon this moment
by giving to the pendulum a certain position; that is, when the pendu-
lum is at a known point, as shown by the reading of the reflection on
the scale. By combining both elongations certain terms in the com-
putation disappeared, thus simplifying the labor. If 2@(a) represents
the moment in the normal position of the pendulum, regarding a as
the distance from the origin, } the linear deviation of the middle of the
ball, e the deviation, likewise expressed in linear measure, caused by
attraction, the moment will be expressed by g(a+b—e) for the first
position of the weights and g(a—b—e) for the second. The sum of
both is 2p(a—e)+b’p"(a—e), but since g’’(a—e)=0, the resulting
moment can be expressed by 2p(a)—2ep'(a), a value which can be ac-
cepted as sufficiently accurate when it is considered that e never ex-
ceeds two millimeters.

Although the attraction of the cylinders upon the instrument is the-
oretically determined with sufficient precision, yet the accuracy of the
final result is linrited by the closeness with which the constants are
known. Therefore it is preferable to eliminate from the final result
those constants which can not be ascertained with the desired accu-
racy. This can be done in the following simple manner:

Suppose a series of observations with the complete apparatus gave
for the mean density 4, and a second series after diminishing the
weights on the upper end of the pendulum gave 4,,; the difference be-
tween these two values rests upon a false value for the specific gravity of
the pendulum, not regarding errors of observation for the present. If
is the error in the moment arising from this cause, the true value can
be derived from 4=4,+~ fs Ay += , mm which m, and m,, are ob-

th

//
tained from the observations. In this manner the attraction of the

weights upon the pendulum-rod appears to be perfectly eliminated
from the final result. It is conditioned upon the value accepted as the
attraction of the balls alone, in which no uncertainty is involved, while
the agreement 4, and 4,, furnishes a thorough control over the experi-
ments.

Correction for the-resistance of the air was applied, and a law for the
decrease in the amplitude sought. This was found to be proportional
to the first power of the velocity, a result which agrees with the expres-
sion found by Cornu and Baille for the effect of the air upon the torsion
balance.

The constants were determined with great care, and in each case the
units of weight and measure were compared with the standards, while

the specific gravity was ascertained from some metal taken from the
same crucible from which the weights were cast. The relative position
of the weights and pendulum balls during the observations was an im-
portant factor, as was also the radius vector of each of the balls, and
they were most carefully investigated. It was found that after the first
few days there was no appreciable change in the length of the wire rope
supporting the weights, so that the employment of the mean relative
position could not introduce dangerous errors. The length of the
pendulum balls from the knife-edge, the principal element entering into
the computation of the moments, was measured by a standard catheto-
meter belonging to the Prussian commission of standards. The dis-
tance of the knife-edge from the scale was ascertained by means of
direct measurement and by triangulation with results quite harmonious.
In the determination of all the constants the effort was made, and suc-
cessfully it is believed, to keep the error within one unit in the third
decimal place.

Just here it might be mentioned that; taking every possible element
into consideration, the resulting moment of the pendulum with the balls
for both positions of the weights was 10.31065, while without the balls
it was 4.357806, in which 6 represents the specific gravity of the weights.

DISCUSSION OF THE OBSERVATIONS AND R#SULTS.

The observations consisted of the determination of the duration of
oscillation and the equilibrium position of the pendulum, for which a
series of fourteen observations were made with the balls on the pendu.
lum and twelve with the balls removed. They were begun with a large
amplitude and continued until the are passed over was only six or ten
minutes. In both cases a continuous decrease in the time showed it-
self, which could not be explained by the usual reduction to the
smallest swings. Hence the time was taken for two double swings
when the amplitude was at an average value, and two or more times
taken on each side of this value. These observations were adjusted
graphically, a method which answered in this case in consequence of
the regularity in the values. The theoretical time was compared with
the observed, and the discrepancy reduced to a minimum. Knowing
the equilibrium position of the pendulum, and the distance of the ball
from this point, at each elongation a simple subtraction gave the dis-
tance of the ball from the attracting body.

The formula used in the final computation was :

4 5
g =a constant 4zrk [ 1+0—( 50-¢) cos? p |
in which 4 is the desired density, R the polar radius, o the ratio of the

with the balls .4,=5.651+ 0.017 and without 4,,=5.73140.020. As al-
ready intimated the discrepancy is to be ascribed to the inaccuracy in
the determination of the weight of the pendulum, so, using the formule
already given:

the reduced observations gave
m,=4.6268 + 0.0136
m,, = 1.9269 + 0.006

from which the mean density 4=5.594+ 0.032.

The probable error of the final result might have been reduced by in-
creasing the number of observations. Still it seemed better while test-
ing this new method not to accumulate too much material or more than
was needed to reach a reasonably accurate result. But since the ex-
periments here made poiut to the possibility of a better solution of
this problem, it is intended to carry the observations further, and by a
new determination of the constants to secure results independent of
their first determination.

CONCLUSION.

For the purpose of comparison, the previously-found values for the
mean density might properly be given here.

Maskelyne found from local deflection at Schehallien, 4.713 ; Colonel
James, at Arthur’s Seat, 5.14; Carlini and Airy received from pendu-
lum determinations 4.837 and 6.623, and in more recent times Menden-
hall and von Sterneck, 5.77.

Cavendish (5.48), Reich (5.49, inthe revision 5.58), Baily (5.66, after
correction by Cornu and Baille, 5.55), Cornu and Baille (5.56) used the
torsion balance, finally Joily (5.692), Poynting (5.69) utilizing the ordi-
nary balance. The result bere found is considerably smaller than
those found by Jolly’s method, and slightly larger than the values
which the torsion balance gave, especially the corrected value of Baily.
I think, however, that the correction here referred to as made by Cornu
and Baille admits of criticism. As in the present case, Baily observed
jn each position of the weights four stationary points. He also used
the time when the balance was stationary at its greatest elongation
for changing the weights, so that the last observation of each series
might at the same time be the first of the next series. With most of
his observations the difference between two consecutive elongations on
the one side did not agree with the corresponding difference on the other,
and furthermore this difference was always greater on the side where the
first reading was. Cornu and Baille concluded that this lack of symme-
try was owing to the presence of a constant error which was not
eliminated in the subsequent adjustments. However, it is not equally
apparent that the tendency of this error is to increase the final result.
According to their belief the irregularity referred to in the diminution
MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH. 643

of the amplitude is owing to unsteadiness which was caused by the
change of the weights, and therefore influences the first reading of each
series. But itis not easy to see how the disturbance, which was so regu-
lar, can be explained in this manner, especially since Baily has ex-
pressly referred to the perfect isolation of the masses, and their easy
motions free from jar. He did not explain with equal clearness the way
in which he obviated such disturbances as might arise from change of
temperature, disturbances which, at the beginning of his observations,
caused serious difficulties. The supposition of a difference of temper-
ature, scarcely shown by-a thermometer, between the masses and the
balance inclosed in a thick box seems justified, and such differences
are sufficient to explain the disturbances of a system swinging with
such a slight inertia. They would be analogous to the irregularities
which have been observed in these experiments to exist between the
temperature of the two sides of the pendulum-rod and which were in
direct dependence upon the algebraic sign of the motion of the zero
point from the source of heat. The disturbances which showed thein-
selves in Baily’s series of observations were regarded as a change of
sign in the course of the zero point, which produced such an effect that
the observed deflection grew regularly with the time since the transfer
of the weights to their new position. The plan of computing the posi-
tion of equilibrium from the last three numbers of each series, a method
which leads to a much smaller value, was set aside by Cornu and
Baille for one which will increase the error in the reduction of Baily’s
work. It would have been too much to expect for this reason a smaller
value for the mean density of the earth from Baily’s observations than
would have resulted from the avoidance of this error, a remark intensi-
fied by the deviation of his result from those deduced by others from
the torsion balance. Unfortunately it is not possible to reach from the
observations any conclusion regarding the two opposing hypotheses,
since no readings are given of a long series without changing the
weights.

The observations here given have shown that the pendulum is a most
excellent instrument for the determination of gravity, a problem which
for a time it did not seem competent to solve. It is to be hoped that
its somewhat restricted domain may be extended. In this connection
there may be mentioned the determining of inner friction, a matter of
great importance in the mechanical theory of gas. Since the resist-
ance of the air in the case of a sensitive pendulum causes a rapid de-
crease in the amplitude of the are, the amount of retardation is so con-
siderable that an accurate determination of the desired quantity can
best be secured from a few observations. The results might be modi-
fied by an appreciable change in the sensitiveness, atmospheric press-
ure, or temperature. Stokes has discussed the case in which an infin-
itely long cylindrical rod oscillates so that its axis remains parallel.
The solution of this is closely related ta that of a rod swinging about
644 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

a fixed axis in a closed box, if in addition to the conditional equations
which are to be fulfilled on the surface of the rod certain others are
introduced. In this way Stokes reduced Baily’s experiments with the
rod-shaped seconds pendulum. In the foregoing case the pendulum-
rod was hollow, into which the air could enter unrestricted. This con-
dition complicated the problem; however only a few changes in the
construction of the pendulum would be necessary in order to render
Stokes’s theory applicable.

May the apparatus whose application to a special case is here shown,
prove itself useful in physical investigations in other realms.

In “ Publicationen des Astrophysikalischen Observatoriums,” vol.
VI (the preceding part of this abstract), I have given a series of obser-
vations which I prosecuted with a peculiarly constructed pendulum for
the purpose of determining the mean density of the earth. The dis-
cussion of these observations led to satisfactory results, but the exper-
iments justified the expectation that a greater accuracy might be
reached by an elimination of certain obstacles, partly of an accidental
nature, and especially by a more thorough protection against the influ-
ence of temperature change. The results of the observations made
after the application of the contemplated improvements gratified the
anticipations, since the probable error in the latter set of experiments
is only one-third of that obtained by the former. The axes of the cy-
linders, which were directed towards the center of the balls attached
to the pendulum, during the first experiments made an angle with the
plane of oscillation in order to secure a sufficient proximity of the balls
to the attracting masses. This state of affairs complicated the numeri-
cal computation of the situation of the pendulum with respect to the
masses, since besides the measurement of the separation of their sur-
faces from the middle point of the apparatus it was necessary to accu-
rately ascertain the difference of direction which the axes of the masses
made with the plane of oscillation. The supports were so changed that
the axes could be brought precisely into the plane of the pendulum.
This simplification made it possible to secure such a position as to allow
a more ready and accurate measurement of the distance of the masses
from the apparatus, and at the same time it served to keep it in that
position. On both sides of the pillar which supported the instrument
places were attached for the support of a contact lever rotating about
a vertical axis. One arm of this lever, terminating in a sharp point,
rested against the back of the attracting mass, while the other arm
swept over a short scale divided into millimeters, provided with a reg-
istering apparatus so that its position could be readily ascertained.
Since the lengths of the arms were as 1: 4, a change in the situation of
the cylinder could be estimated to a tenth of a millimeter without dif-
ficulty. In case of a contrary movement of the mass, the pin of the
lever would keep in contact with it through action of a pressure weight
MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH. 645

on the lever. The guides on the sides were renewed and made stronger
so as to counteract all swinging motions of the masses.

While the changes and improvements just referred to were being
made to secure a more accurate and ready determination of the con-
stants, protection against the ill effects of sudden and irregular changes
in temperature in the neighborhood of the apparatus was so complete
as to obtain a closer agreement in the results of the experiments. The
door and window were also tightened and the wooden coverings coated
with paint. The box containing the pendulum was covered with tin-
foil and white-lead, and the attracting masses were likewise subjected
to a covering of tin-foil so as to free them from the action of the lamp
which illuminated the scale. To still further secure the apparatus from
sudden changes of temperature during a series of observations all oper-
ations were conducted without entering the room, employing electricity
to mark the correct height of the cylinders when their positions were
changed.

With the precautions just referred to, it was possible not only to keep
the temperature of the room constant during a series of observations,
but also to eliminate, so far as the thermometer would show, the effect
of the warmth of the lamp, which was apparent during the first set of
experiments.

A disturbance was however noticeable, caused by a temporary hori-
zontal stratification of temperature, which in the neighborhood of the
apparatus was interrupted by the changing of the masses whose tem-
peratures were unequal. I sought to compensate the operation of this
interruption by so attaching lead disks of the same diameter as the
cylinders that they remained in every position opposite the masses, in
‘this way securing at each change the same temperature throughout any
horizontal cross-section of the pendulum.

The order of observing is essentially the same as during the former
series; however, instead of having a pause in the middle of the set, with
four readings on each side, or before and after, the eight or ten readings
of the elongations of the pendulum were consecutive, in this way
making it possible to discuss the observations of a day as equably dis-
tributed over the period of observation. In the determination of the
time of oscillation of the pendulum after the removal of the extra weight
on its upper end a better method was adopted by computing the desired
quantity directly from the means of two series of observations separated
from one another by a considerable interval. =

In the first experiments I computed numerically the attraction of the
masses upon the pendulum rod. The result was important, especially
as a control or check upon the experiments, but on account of the un-
certainty in the computation of certain constants which entered into
the work, it was not to be compared with the latter results which were
obtained by an empirical elimination. In these computations this con-
trol could be dispensed with, thus relieving one of the numerical work
646 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

which the determination of the moments of the pendulum required. On
the other hand it was desirable to make surer the empirical elimination
or ascertaining of these constants by increasing and modifying the ob-
servations. I have therefore made a series of observations, using on
the pendulum balls of lead the same size but heavier than the brass
balls, which, combined with the series made without any balls, gave an-
other result independent of the result obtained when the brass balls were
used.

In all other respects the method of reduction was the same as during
the first determination.

The value found for the mean density is 5.579+ 0.012.
AMERRIQUES, AMERIGHO VESPUCCI, AND AMERICA.

By JULES Marcou.

INTRODUCTION.

The Amerriques tribe of Indians, now few in number, are confined
to their mountains, called Sierra Amerrique, which form the cordillera
between Lake Nicaragua and the Mosquito coast, in the province of
Chontales, Nicaragua.

By a combination of circumstances, not rare, in what pertain to the
first discoveries made in the New World, the name of Amerrique was
not printed or perhaps even written in documents until 1872, when the
late Thomas Belt, a naturalist of genius, during an exploration of
Nicaragua, heard of the name and used it in his excellent and very
remarkable book “The Naturalist in Nicaragua,” London, 1874. De
Humboldt says: ‘‘ Les pays découverts les premiers sont aujourd’hui
oubliés et presque déserts.” (See “ Examen critique de histoire de la
géographie du nouveau continent,” vol. I11, p. 381, Paris, 1839.)

SIERRA AMERRIQUE AND THE AMERRIQUES.

I quote all I have been able to gather on the subject:

“At a short distance to the west (of Fairbairn’s ranch, 2 leagues from
Libertad, Nicaragua), rise the precipitous rocks of the Amerrique range,
with great perpendicular cliffs, and huge isolated rocks and pinacles.
The name of this range gives us a clue to the race of the ancient inhab-
itants. In the highlands of Honduras, as has been noted by Squiers,
the termination of tique or rique is of frequent occurrence in the name
of places, as Chaparristique, Lapaterrique, Llotique, Ajuterique, and oth-
ers. The race that inhabited this region were the Leuca Indians. - - -
I think that the Leuca Indians were the ancient inhabitants of Chon-
tales, - - - and that they were partly conquered, and their territories
encroached upon by the latter before the arrival of the Spaniards.”
Now the Chontales Indians are confined to the western part of the
province of that name (departamento de Chontales), west of the cordil-
lera or Amerrique range; while all the eastern part, as far as the Mos-
quito coast (Reserva Mosquita), is inhabited by uncivilized Indians

called Caribisi or Caraibs, and also Amerriques, Careas, and Ramas In-
dians—iribus de aborigenes no civilizados—as they are called on maps of
Nicaragua.

On Fairbairn’s Ranch: ‘ There are many evidences of a large Indian
population having lived at this spot, and their pottery and fragments
of their stones for bruising maize have been found in some graves that
have been opened.” - - - ‘There are many old Indian graves, covered
with mounds of earth and stones.” (See “The Naturalist in Nicara-
gua,” p. 154.) At page 324, Belt refers again to the cordillera, saying:
“About noon we came in sight of the Amerrique range, which I recog:
nized at once, and knew that we had reached the Juigalpa district.”

As regards gold, Belt, the engineer of the Chontales Gold Mining
Company, during his four years’ residence in Nicaragua, was particu-
larly well posted as to the location of the mines; and he says: ‘Gold
mining at Santo Domingo is confined almost entirely to auriferous
quartz lodes, no alluvial deposits having been found that will pay for

working. - - - The gold does not occur pure, but is a natural alloy
of gold and silver, containing about three parts of the former to one
of the latter. - - - The small town of Libertad is the principal min-

ing centre of Chontales. There are a great number of gold mines in its
vicinity.”

The absence of paying placers, or auriferous alluvial gravels, in the
valleys of the Rios Mico and Carca, the two main affluents of the Rio
Blewfields, shows that they had been worked out in the old Indian time.

The following letter from Mr. Belt, written a short time before his
premature death,* is interesting, because it gives his impression after
reading my first paper on the “ Origin of the name America,” published
in the Atlantic Monthly for March, 1876:

LONDON, April 8, 1878.
M. JULES MARCOU,
Salins, Jura, France:

My Dear Sir: I am much obliged to you for your kind letter and
the copy of your most ingenious speculation respecting the origin of the
name * Amérique.”

The Amerrique range in Nicaragua was well known to me, and the
curious coincidence with the name of the continent had often struck me,
but only as a coincidence.

I hope your suggestion will receive the attention it deserves, and that
the origin of the name will be thoroughly inquired about. Should it
turn out as you believe, you will have cleared up a most interesting
point.

Iam, dear sir, yours very truly,
THOMAS BELT.

In 1887, by a happy circumstance, I was able to communicate with
Senator Don José D. Rodriguez, of Managua (Nicaragua), who lived for

*Thomas Belt, born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1832, died at Kansas City (Kansas),
the 21st of September, 1878.
THE NAME AMERICA. 649

many years in the dsitrict of Chontales, and who was also a personal
friend of Thomas Belt. Here are extracts from two of his letters to me:

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 29, 1887.

- - - The word Amerrique is pronounced as Mr. Thomas Belt wrote
it by the natives of the tribe, with whom I have conversed. These In-
dians seem to have been formerly a powerful tribe. Ata distance from
the sierra (range), in the level ground, there are extensive spaces which
were at one time cemeteries and undoubtedly belonged to these Indians.

It is certain that towards the south other tribes inhabited that region.
It is, moreover, easy to note that they kept up, from a very ancient date,
a communication with the Atlantic coast, cultivating probably friendly
relations with the once war-like tribe of the Moscos, who held the coun-
try from about Laguna de Caratasca (Honduras) and the Cape Gracias
a Dios to a little south of the Laguna de Perlas and the rio Blewfields.

At the present day the Amerriques are few in number, but I do not
feel able, at the moment, to give any sufficient reason for the fact. They
are not molested by any one and they live at their ease in their mount-
ains, but it is evident that no long time will elapse before they disap-
pear entirely, perhaps by absorption into other tribes. - - - Mr.
Thomas Belt, to whom you refer, must have had occasion to know the
mountains and the Indians of that name during a journey which he
made over the cordillera to Matagalpa and Segovia. I served under the
order of that gentleman in the mines of Chontales, and enjoyed the
honor of his friendship and confidence.

WASHINGTON, January 12, 1888.

- - - [ean assure you that the insinuation, ascribed to Mr. Peralta,
that the name Amerrique was invented by my deceased friend, Mr.
Thomas Belt, is an entirely gratuitous one. The mountain range and
the tribe of the Amerriques have existed in Nicaragua for centuries
which itis beyond our power to determine; and these facts may be veri-
fied at any moment. Moreover, Mr. Belt was a serious person, who
would never have lent himself to a deception.

This protest of Senator J. D. Rodriguez was brought out by the posi-
tion taken by a few opponents, who claimed that because the map-
makers have not inscribed the name Amerrique on any of the maps
known until now, the name Amerrique applied to a chain of mountains
of Nicaragua was created out of Mr. Belt’s ‘inner consciousness.”
Don Manuel M. de Peralta, minister of Costa Rica at Washington, wrote
a letter to the President of the Republic of Nicaragua, Don Ad. Car-
denas, asking if there really is in ‘‘el departamento de Chontales” a
chain of mountains known by the name of Amerique, Amerrique, or
Americ. The answer not only confirmed the existence of the Sierra
Amerrique, but also of a tribe of Indians called “los Amerriques”; and
that the spelling of the name was as Mr. Belt wrote it: Amerrique, with
two 7’s.

From those well-authenticated facts, we can be fully confident that
there are still in existence the remnants of an Indian tribe calling them-
selves Amerriques, formerly powerful, and extending over a great part
of the ground between the Lake of Nicaragua and the Atlantic coast.
650 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

The mountains to which they are now confined are called Amerrique
range, or Sierra Amerrique; and they have occupied for centuries the
richest gold area of the region. The gold mines are numerous and are
worked even to this day, on a great scale, round Libertad, Santo Do-
mingo, and Juigalpa, where great quantities of the precious metal have
been and are still extracted. The name Juigalpa (Huzgalpa) means
the country of gold; and the name of the Mosquito coast in the Indian lan-
guage is Tauzgalpa, or Taguzgalpa. Galpa means gold, so that the true
name of the country between the Cape Gracias 4 Dios to the Rios Rama
and San Juan, instead of being Mosquito coast or Mosquita, is, accord-
ing to the aborigines, Gold Coast.

Now let us see about the first explorations by European navigators
of the coast of the central part of the New World.

FIRST VOYAGE OF VESPUCCI.

From the beginning we are confronted by the most contested of Ves-
pucci’s voyages, May, 1497, to October, 1498. Las Casas, Herrera,
Charlevoix, Robertson, Tiraboschi, Munoz, Navarette, and Washing-
ton Irving declare that the author of the “ Quatuor Navigationes” has
forged his first voyage. Alexander de Humboldt, after calling his so-
called first voyage prétendu, tries to show an alibi for Vespucci, who,
according to his opinion, was then in Sevilla and at San Luear super-
intending the arming of a fleet for the third voyage of Cristoforo Co-
lombo, from April, 1497, to May, 1498; and accordingly in a material
impossibility of having then accomplished his first voyage, which fin-
ally he calls “‘ problematic voyage of a contested date,”* admitting as
proved that the date of May 10 or 20, 1497, is false.

F. A. deVarnhagen is the only person who has accepted and maintained
by excellent arguments and proofs drawn from the three historians,
Pierre Martyr d@’Anghiera, Oviedo and Gomara, the authenticity of the
first voyage. After a careful study of all the objections, I have come
to the same conclusion with Varnhagen, who correctly says, that ‘ if
the first voyage is not true, all fall to the ground ;” and also, “if we
admit that Vespucci has been guilty of not telling the truth in regard
to such an important voyage, then we must treat him as a forger and
an imposter, and accept nothing of all that he says in his four voyages.”
In fact, if the first voyage is a fable, or even only *‘ problematic,” Ves-
pucci is a fabulist and an imposter who can not be trusted. But I do
not believe it is the case. Vespucci, according to the great admiral,
Cristoforo Colombo, was a good man (es mucho hombre de bien), unfor-
tunate in his commercial enterprise, but eagerly looking out to
get a reputation of being a great discoverer and traveler, what I have
called him before, a tan fino, in Italian (Nouvelles recherches, p. 80, Paris,
1888.)

* Examen critique, vol. Iv, p. 292.
THE NAME AMERICA. 651

According to Varnhagen the chiefs of this expedition of 1497 were V.
Y. Pinson and J. D. de Solis; they first saw the land in the vicinity of
the Cape Gracias 4 Dios, and after two days’ sailing, in following a sandy
coast, they stopped at a small harbor near the Laguna de Caratasca,
Honduras. They met there a great many Indians of the Caraibes type,
some of whom possessed a few gold ornaments, which they got from
some neighboring tribes. As we know now that the Amerriques Indi-
ans had relations with the Caraibes of the coast as far as the Laguna
de Caratasca, we have here the first contact of the Spaniards with the
Indians possessing a little gold on the coast of Central America; and
it is possible that the name Amerrique was then spoken of as a tribe of
Indians and a country rich in gold, for it is the only gold area of that
part of the coast of Honduras.

THE LAST VOYAGE OF COLOMBO.

Cristoforo Colombo in his fourth and last voyage sighted the Cape
Gracias a Dios the 14th of September, 1502, followed all along the Mos-
quito coast, until he stopped at Quiriviri (Huerta Island), now Booby
Island, opposite the Indian village of Cariai at the mouth of the Rio
Rama. He staid there ten days, from the 25th of September until
the 5th of October. There he repaired his vessels and let his crews
recruit after their very fatiguing navigation from Cuba.

The Indians were friendly and there was a great deal of communica-
tion and intercourse between them and the one hundred and fifty sea-
men composing the crews of his four caravels (schooners). Colombo
in his Lettera rarissima says that at Cariai he heard of gold mines in
the province of Ciamba; that he took with him two Indians who con-
ducted him to another place called Carambaru, where the aborigines
are always naked and carry round their necks mirrors in gold, which
they declined to exchange on any account. At Cariai, the Indians
named several places where gold mines existed; the last named being
Veragua, 25 leagues distant.

As de Humboldt says, that letter is not clear; it is written in a mel-
ancholy mood, and characterized by many obscuritirs and want of
order, due to many injustices and deceptious to which Colombo was
subjected at the end of his life. Colombo was then an old man, almost
infirm, when he wrote the letter at Jamaica, the 7th July, 1503, just
after returning from the rich gold region of Veragua; being badly treated
by the governor, Ovando, his mind was more or less affected by his suf-
fering, and it is not strange if he did not give all the details and all the
names of the countries rich in gold, as well as the names of the Indian
tribes with which he came in contact.

However, from his letter, we can say almost to a certainty that Cariaj
was at the mouth of the Rio Rama, that Colombo heard there of the
tribe of Amerriques as possessing a good deal of gold, which the Span-
iards were so anxious to get; that he took with him two Indians with

whom he went to Carambaru, another land. Carambaru in all proba-
bility, as we shall see if we consult a map of the coast, was at or near
the mouth of the Rio Blewfields and there he found Indians wearing
round their necks mirrors in gold which they declined to trade away.

Those Indians can not be any others than the Amerriques, who then
inhabited the gold area of the province of Ciamba, occupying all the
placeres of the Rios Mico and Carea, the two main affluents of the Rio
Blewficelds. Being not successful in his endeavor to get their gold mir-
rors, Colombo was not well disposed to speak much of those Indians,
and he did not give their name nor the name of the country from which
they got the gold, speaking only of the province of Ciamba and the vil-
lage of Carambaru, without localizing the area of gold in the Sierra
Amerrique, as he did for Veragua.

But because Colombo did not write the name Amerrique in his letter
to the King and Queen of Spain it does not follow that he did not hear it;
and it would be against all that we know of discoverers of gold regions
if the name Amerrique was not heard and afterwards repeated by Co
lombo and the one hundred and fifty men of his crews. If Colombo
is the on:y man who ever wrote anything about that eventful and diffi-
cult voyag?, all his hundred and fifty companions spoke at their return
of what they saw and heard during the voyage; and it is to them, and
probably also to Colombo, that is due the spread among the people of
the nanie Amerrique as a country rich in gold and of Indians of that
name possessing gold mirrors as their only article of dress. The name
passed ‘rom mecith to mouth, first among seamen, and then it pene-
trated int- !:¢ continent of Europe so fast that in less than twelve
years the name Amerrique was generally used to designate the New
World, aczording to a contemporary, John Schoener, of Bamberg.

That the name came from the masses of the people and not from the
few scholars who could read and write Latin is admitted by everybody.
Officially the name was “ Las Indias” and “* New World.” Until 1520
we do not possess a single map with the name America, and if any ex-
isted with that name, they have been lost and destroyed, since their
number must have been extremely limited; and they can not be quoted
as having spread the name among the people, who then did not know
how to read, for we must always have in mind that it was the begin-
ning of the sixteenth century and that the number of people able to
read and write was very small and formed a special class far above the
common people and having only oceasional contact with the masses.

In résumé, Colombo and his one hundred and fifty companions saw
Indians on the Mosquito coast wearing gold mirrors round their necks
and otherwise naked. They had long talks with them in regard to
countries and peoples where the gold existed in their neighborhood.
We know now that those Indians were the Amerriques Indians, that they
live still in the most productive gold area of that region, and that the
Sierra Amerrique is, according to Thomas Belt, the most conspicuous

land-mark between Lake Nicaragua and the Atlantic coast. After the
last voyage of Colombo of 1503 the name Amerrique spread so fast in
Europe among the sailors and common people that in 1515 it was gen-
erally adopted and used to designate the New World. Such are facts
which seem well established.

Now we come to the singular and rather mysterious christening of
the New World at St. Dié, in Lorraine.

CONFUSION OF VESPUCCI’S CHRISTIAN NAME.

The Christian name of Vespucci is an example of confusion unique
in history. Being an Italian, it was to be expected that his first name
would be given exactly by his countrymen; on the contrary, they are the
authors of all the confusions. As far back as 1503, or 1504 at most, the
Italians Lorenzo Pier Francisco di Medicis, of Florence, and Giovanni
del Giocondo, of Verona, call Verpucei A lbericus, a Christian name well
known ; and even since, until a few years ago, Italians, and more espe-
cially Florentins, have persisted in calling him Alberico and even Alber-
tutio. I made diligent researches to know exactly Vespucci’s Christ-
ian name. Ina country like Tuscany and its capital Flerence, where
sO many erroneous and forged documents have appeared on Vespucci
in manuscripts, letters, printed books, and even inscriptions engraved
on marble that I was obliged to be very careful before accepting any
name that it should be well authenticated by indisputable documents.
After many researches I did not find anything certain until the appear-
ance of the first letter of Vespucci to Laurentio Petri de Medicis, with the
name Albericus Vesputius, in 1504 or 1505. And in my second paper,
‘* Nouvelles Recherches sur ’Origine du nom @’ Amérique” (Bulletin Soe.
de Géographie, p. 66, Paris, 1888), say: ‘As long as the Christian name
of Vespucci has not been submitted to a very minute and exact control,
we must remain in doubt as to which is the true one, Alberico or
Amerigo.” - - - The question has a certain importance, although
its solution does not touch the vital and most important part of the
origin of the name America, which remains undecided between the
poetical license of Jean Basin and the indigenous name in the New
World of Amerrique. The decision of this point will involve Vespucci
more or less according to the help which he may have given, perhaps
without knowing it, to the christening at St. Dié.”

It is true that I inclined then toward Alberico instead of Amerigo for
the Christian name of Vespucci; and in my second paper I have giver
reasons which seemed to sustain that view ; saying, however, several
times in speaking of Amerigo, that it was either his true Christian name,
or only a surname or nickname.

Diligent researches were continued to find proof if Amerigo was truly
an Italian Christian name; for a learned Italian friend, who then
lived at Florence, wrote me that the name, unknown to him as a Chris-
tian name, even after the celebrity given the name by Vespucci, was not
used in Italy. ;
THE NAME AMERICA. 655
HAMERICUS IN DANTE AND AMERIGO IN MACHIAVELLI.

My son, Dr. Philippe B. Marcou, succeeded last year (1888) in finding
twice the name Hamericus and Amerigo; first in Dante Allighieri, ‘* De
Vulgaris eloquentia,” liber secundus, caput vi, and in the Comedia di
Nicolo Machiavelli, in his Opere, vol. nono, Milano, 1805, where he has,
as his first personage, Amerigo, vecchio Padrone, and as his last, frate
Alberigo; besides he speaks at page 45 of the same volum> in Novella
piace volissima di Nicollo Machiavelli, of a “ figlinola d’? Amerigo Do-
nati.” In Danté we have two proveneal poets of the name Hamericus,
written with an h, as a family name written in provencal or langue d’oc,
“ Aimeric.” Even now the name Emeric isa family name in Provence.

Danté inhabited Provence for some time, and was well acquainted
with two Provencal poets, Emeric of Belinoi and Emeric of Péguilain;
and in translating the family name of Emeric into Hamericus, its Latin
form, it does not follow that he regarded Emeric as the Provencal name
of the Florentine Amerigho; and we can not quote Danté as having
translated the name Amerigho or Amerigo into Hamericus.

AMERIGO IN SPAIN IN 1495.

A short time after I received a letter from Don Marcos J. de la Es-
pada, the most learned Americanist of Spain, and who knows more
about the Archives de Indios than anybody else. The letter, dated
Madrid, 22 de Marzo de 1889, says: ‘“ Por el consta que Amerigo Ves-
pucci se llameba y se llamabe Amerigo en las libros de cuentes y despa-
chos de armadas 4 Indias perde el aiio de 1495.”

The oldest document made public in Spain before this was a receipt
dated January 12, 1496, with only the name Vespuche, and no Christian
name. The first time we have the Christian name of Vespucci, in well-
authenticated documents, is in the two letters of Cristoforo Colombo of
the 5th and 25th of February, 1505, written two years after the return
of Colombo from his last voyage. Now since the discovery of Seftor de
la Espada we have the Christian name Amerigo in 1495, consequently
before any of the voyages of Vespucci to the New World, and before the
fourth voyage of Colombo to Nicaragua and Veragua. It is most im-
portant, for the Libros de gastos de armadas of the archives de la casa de
contractation at Sevilla, are justly regarded as an excellent authority
for everything relating to the first voyages of discoveries of the New
World or Las Indias.

AMERIGHO IN THE ARCHIVES OF MANTOVA IN 1492.

Lately I have received from Rome a paper: ‘Come veramente si
chiamasse il Vespucci, e se dal nome di lui sia venuto quello del Nuovo
Mondo, nota del socio Gilberto Govi” (Rendiconti della R. accademia
dei Lincei, vol. Iv, pp. 297-307, seduta del 18 nov. 1888, Roma, 4to).

The author, Signor G. Govi, has the good fortune to publish the only

THE NAME AMERICA. A 657

truly authentic letter of Vespucci that had yet been found in Italy.
It was discovered by Signor Davari conservatore dell ’archivio Gonzoga
di Mantova, and although very short—only seven lines—is most impor-
tant for itis wholly written by Vespucci, who was, as I have said be-
fore, an excellent calligraphist. The date is: Sybilie die xxx decembris
M°CCCOOLXXXAXIT (Sevilla, the 30 Dec., 1492), and consequently
before the return of Colombo from his first voyage. The very distinct
signature is:
Ser. Amerigho Vespucci mer-

chante fiorentino for

Sybilia.

I have received a photograph of the letter and its address, by the
courtesy of an Italian friend; and I here give the fac-simile of it, as
well as of the signature to a letter of Vespucci to the Cardinal Arch-
bishop of Toledo, dated Sevilla, 9 December, 1508, which was published
in fac-simile by the Spanish Government in 1878. Those two letters
are the only authentic ones we possess; and the signatures are too
important in the question of the origin of the name America not to be

carefully studied.
pelt cH

Now we have, without any possible doubt, the Christian name of
Vespucci, written by himself Amerigho with only one r and an h at the
last syllable, in 1492; and Amerigo with only one y and no h in the
Libros de cuentes y despachos de armadas a Indias in 1495.

Gilberto Govi* thinks that it is the Italian Fra Giovanni del Giocondo,
who translated and changed too freely Amerigho into Alberico. It is
only a personal opinion, without any base to rest upon, for the original
letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo Pierfrancisco de Medicis is unknown.
Generally, translators do not alter and change the signatures of authors;
and so long as we have no positive proof to the contrary, we must say
that Vespucci used for his Christian name, in 1502 or 1503, the name
Alberico or Alberigo. But as his second letter to Piedro Soderini, writ-
ten in 1504, is signed Amerigo, it is evident that he did not make use of
the name Alberico for any length of time. There are certainly strong
suspicions that he made use of it, not only in his first letter to Medicis,
but also because Gomara, a Spanish historian of great reputation, in
his General History of the Indies of 1551, uses both names, saying
Americo or Alberico Vespucci, showing that in Spain the name of Al-

berico must have been known quite well during the first part of the
sixteenth century, although we do not know a single example of the
name having been used in any official authentic Spanish document re-
lating to Vespucci.

COSMOGRAPHIA INTRODUCTIO.

Thanks to the discoveries and researches of Alex. de Humboldt,
D’Avezac, and a few others, we know a great deal about the Cosmo-
graphie Introductio of the Vosgian gymnasium of St. Dié, in which is
found the first announcement of the name America as the name of the
New World. The interested reader will find all the descriptions, dis-
sertations, and conclusions of the extraordinary value attached to this
now very celebrated small quarto volume in the ‘“‘ Examen critique,”
by Alex. de Humboldt, 5 vols., Paris, 1839; ‘‘ Martin Hylacomilus
Waltzemuller,” by D’Avezac, Paris, 1867; and “ Nouvelles recherches
sur Vorigine du nom @Amérique,” by Jules Marcou, Paris, 1888, in
Bulletin Soc. géographie.

The only addition to our knowledge about the printing press of St.
Dié, is that it was removed in 1512 to Strasburg, from whence, very
likely, it came; and that the same types used for the Cosmographie
Introductio were used at Strasburg in 1512 and 1513 to finish the print-
ing of the Ptolemey’s Geography of 1513, two-thirds of it having been
printed at St. Dié between 1505 and 1510, as D’Avezac has proved. So,
instead of calling it the Strasburg’s Ptoléme, it ought to be called the
Vosgian Gymnasium Ptoléme, or at least the St. Dié and Strasburg’s
Ptoléme.

M. Ed. Meaume has lately proved the existence of a fourth ezition,
or more properly speaking, fourth issue, of the Cosmographic Introductio
of St.-Dié, which had been considered by d’Avezac and Mr. H. Harisse
as an amalgamated copy, composed with parts taken from the first and
third issue or edition. (See “ Recherches critiques et bibliographiques
sur Améric Vespuce et ses voyages,” par Ed. Meaume, Chapitre iti,
‘‘La Cosmographie Introductio, étude bibliographique sur les quatre
premieres éditions—Saint-Dié, 1507, p. 83, in ‘Mémoires de la Société
d@Archéologie, Lorraine,” 3°"* série, vol. xv1, Nancy, 1883.)

The late M. Meaume thought that this reprint or last issue was made
in 1508, although dated, like the thiru edition, 29th August, 1507. It is
very probable that Waltzemiiller (Zlacomylus) tried a second time to
place secretly his name as the author of the book instead of the col-
lective name of the Vosgian Gymnasium; but being promptly detected,
the issue was stopped at once, just as Gauthier had stopped the distri-
bution of the first issue. This explains the great rarity of the fourth
issue or edition. Only four copies are now known: the one called the
Chartener’s copy of Metz, now in the possession of M. Langlard, of
Nancy; the second copy, described by Mr. Harisse in his “ Bibliotheca
Americana Vetustissima,” under No. 47, p. 92, belonging to the Lenox’s
THE NAME AMERICA 659

Library of New York; the third copy is in the Mazarine Library in
Paris (an incomplete copy, having only the first thirty-eight leaves);
and the fourth copy is preserved in the city library of Besangon.

After having been deterred twice from naming himself as the sole
author of the St..Dié book, Waltzemiiller got up a special edition of
his own, which he had printed at Strasburg in 1509. Very likely these
proceedings caused an estrangement and a final breach between the casti-
gator (proof-reader) Zlacomylus and the Vosgian Gymnasium, and this
was the main reason for the stopping of the St.-Dié’s Ptolemey edition,
and its transfer to Strasburg in 1512, where it was issued at last in 1513.

“LE QUATTRO GIORNATE.”

After his success with the publication of his first letter to Lorenzo
Pierfrancisco de Medicis, Vespucci took special precautions to have all
his voyages well known in different parts of Europe. In his letter to
Soderini, of 1504, he speaks of a book written by him under the title
“Le Quattro Giornate,” which was never published, and the manu-
script of which had escaped all researches until this day. But he wrote
a résumé of it, dated Lisbonne, September 4, 1504, taking special care
to address it, first, to the King of Spain; second, to his friend the
Gonfalonier of Florence; and third, to King René, duce of Lorraine.

The copy addressed to Ferdinand of Spain was never published, and
until now has not been found in the archives of Spain. Probably it
was written in Spanish, and with a dedication to the King. The copy
addressed to Soderini was published in 1506, at Pescia, near Florence,
by Piero Paccini, under the title, “‘ Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle
isole nuovamente trovate in quatro suoi viaggi,” in an [talian rather
incorrect, containing a quantity of Spanish words and phrases, as
might be expected from a man like Vespucci, who had lived at least
twelve years in Spain or among Spaniards. It was dedicated to His
Magnificence Signor Pietro Soderini, Perpetual Gonfalonier of the Il-
lustre Republic of Florence, but without the name, giving only his title
of ‘“ Magnifice Domine,” and “ Vostra Mag.”

The third copy was addressed to René, King of Sicily and J erusalem
and Due of Lorraine. It was published in 1507, at St. Dié, by the
Gymnasium Vosagense, under the title “ Quattuor Americi Vesputii
Navigationes,” in Latin, translated by the Canon Jean Basin, from a
French version. That French version was never published, or, if pub-
lished, no copy of it has ever been found; and the manuscript is un-
known, very likely lost and destroyed. It is dedicated to the ‘ Illus-
trissimo Renato Jherusalem et Sicilio Regis ;” but for some unexplained
reason the dedication to Soderini was copied entirely, with only the
name of the good King René put instead of * Maguifice Domine,” and
“T. M.” (tua majestas) instead of * Vostra Mag.,” which has been ren-
dered by the translator from Italian into French as “¢ Vestra Majestas”
or “ Votre Majesté.” It has been the custom to say that Jean Basin
660 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

made the change, in his Latin version, as a sort of poetical license. But
it is very doubtful, for King René received the French manuscript, and
very likely the person who sent it made the dedication, as it is the
custom when you address Royalty. Besides, René gave the manuscript
to his secretary, Gaultier Lud, and finally Lud delivered it to Jean
Basin; and it is too much to suppose that Jean Basin took upon him-
self to alter the manuscript to such an extent, for it would have raised
protests from both Lud and the good and honest King René.

Who did send the manuscript to King René is not known with cer-
tainty. Alexander de Humboldt thought it was Vespucci himself, and
everything favors the same conclusion. Vespucci was desirous of no-
toriety as a great traveller and discoverer. He addressed his first letter
to a Medicis, after placing the relation of his third voyage in the hands
of the King, Don Manuel of Portugal; and he addressed his second
letter first to the King, Don Ferdinand of Spain, and second to the
Perpetual Gonfalonier of Florence, instead of Lorenzo Pierfranescio de
Medicis, who was dead. Evidently Vespucci sought the good opinions
of the great of the earth, and to acquaint them with what he did as a
navigator and discoverer. Not knowing French, he had his manuscript
translated, and the translator did it literally, only by an oversight of
Vespucci he wrote the dedication to the illustrious King René, and sub-
stituted for Vostra Mag., ‘ Votre Majesté.” Very likely Vespucci in-
tended to make some changes in the term of the dedication used for
Soderini, but by some mistake or misunderstanding, or from being
at some distance from the translator,—if the translation was made in
Florence, which is probably the case.* Vespucci was not able to see
that the dedication to King René was correct, and the elegant poet,
Jean Basin, simply translated into Latin the French version without
any explanation or rectification, not knowing if Vespucci really had oc-
casion to know King René in his youth.

No trace of a correspondence between Vespucci and King René has
been found. We are reduced to conjecture. Vespucci was interested
to enrol among his admirers such an important personage as the good
King René, known as a Meccenas and a seeker for geographical news,
for itis known that he had sent Ringman twice to Italy in order to
control the texts of Ptoleme and procure the best copies it was possible
to collect. There is no doubt that Vespucci was well informed of what
was going on in the world. He knew that Lorenzo Pierfrancisco de
Medicis was dead, and that his first letter had been published in Latin
in Paris; and he wanted his second letter to be also published in Latin
in central Europe.

It is possible that King René received the French translation of the
four voyages of Vespucci from another source; only then it is difficult

*The translation of the second letter of Vespucci into French was made at Florence,
by some oue well acquainted with the family of Vespucci, for the translator has added
that Soderini and he were pupils at the school kept by the uncle of Vespucci; a fact
which is not indicated in the Italian edition,
THE NAME AMERICA. 661

to account for the position taken by Jean Basin and the whole Vosgian
Gymnasium, that Vespucci was the discoverer of the New World, a
position which can not have been taken lightly and without the knowledge
and consent of King René. It was well known that Cristoforo Colombo
was the discoverer; and the members of the Vosgian Gymnasium can
not have ignored the fact, because the first voyage of Colombo had been
published not only in Paris, but also in Strasburg in 1497; and Ring-
man, who had inhabited Paris and had been twice in Italy, must have
been well acquainted with all the history of the first voyage of
Colombo.

The reference of the discovery of the New World to Vespucci by the
Vosgian Gymnasium of St. Dié in 1207 is a very suspicious act, which
can not be explained, except that a conspiracy existed after the death
of Colombo to reduce, and even obliterate, the great celebrity attached
to his memory, and that Vespucci was a party to, or at least helped
secretly, the undertaking. The members of the Vosgian Gymnasium
were not in a position to decide so bluntly, as they did, that Vespucci
was the discoverer of the New World; and it is impossible to explain
the position they have taken, without supposing that they had recourse
to underhand influences, and a ope desire to create a rival and an
adversary to Colombo.

The second letter of Vespucci is written in a yery careful way, in
order to escape all associations with any of the other navigators. He
has taken a special care not to name a single commander or chief of
the expeditions in which he was engaged, and any one not well
acquainted with all the first voyages to the New World will easily be
deceived, and be led to beiieve that he was in command himself. As I
have said before, his two published letters are the work of a very
shrewd man, a tan fino in Italian. It is unique in maritime voyages
that a man who was a subordinate does not give the name of the chief
of his expeditions. That he may have passed over one of those names
may be understood and regarded as a forgetfulness of no great conse-
quence, but that all four are passed silently over is a case of willful
negligence.

Vespucci certainly addressed the manuscripts of his voyages to the
Kings of Spain and Portugal, to a Medicis and to the Perpetual Gon-
falonier of florence; and it is reasonable and natural to suppose that
he did send them also to King René, Due of Lorraine. The other sup-
position, that King René received the French translation of the four
navigations of Vespucci from another source can not be accepted, unless
it was proved by authentic facts and documents, which is not the case.

Humboldt says: ** Vespucei was in correspondence with René IL” *
Unhappily nothing has been found yet in the archives of Lorraine on
the subject, and we are reduced to probabilities and inductions.

662 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

AMERIGE, AMERICUS, AND AMERICA,

However this may be decided, the Vosgian Gymnasium published in
April, 1507, a Latin translation of the résumé of the four voyages of
Vespucci, and in the introduction, Cosmographiw Introductio, is the
christening of the New World under the name of America, in honor of
Americus (Amerige) Vespucius, who discovered it.

It took many years to prove that Vespucci was not the discoverer of
the terra firma of the New World and consequently had no valid cla'm
to its name, and the numerous and voluminous discussions and contro-
versies on this subject have lasted until this century.

Jean Basin, the translator from the French into Latin of the “ Qua-
tuor navigationes” of Vespucci, instead of retaining the word Amerige
for the Christian name of Vespucci, as it was inthe manuscript, turned
it into Americus. He knew perfectly well that it was a very free trans-
lation, not easy to accept without an explanation, and consequently he
took the precaution to print in two places of this small book the word
Amerige very conspicuously opposite Americus, in order to show that by
Americus he means the Christian name of Vespucci. The French trans-
lator from the original Italian text did not translate Amerigo by Americ,
or Emeric, or Aimeric, but by Amerige; it was only in 1515, when a
French translation by Mathurin Du Redouer of the third voyage of Ves-
pucci appeared in Paris, that Amerigo was translated into Emerie and
not Amerige; and strange to say, Redouer translated it from the cele-
brated collection of Vicenza of 1507, in which the Christian name of
Vespucci is Alberico ; showing what confusion Vespucci and his friends
had already created by using indiscriminately the word Amerigo and
Alberico, two different names in Florence, where Machiavelli in his
Comedia uses both for two entirely different personages called Amerigo
and Alberigo. :

TRIPLE ERRORS IN THE CHRISTENING OF ST. DIE.

The Vosgian Gymnasium first attributed tbe discovery of the New
World to Vespucci in 1507, two years after the death of Colombo, and
during the lifeof Vespucci, who did not die until 1512. Vespucci did not
rectify the error, and no document exists which shows any steps taken
by him to decline the honor. This absence of protestation on his part
has a tendency to sustain the idea that it was he who suggested to
King René andthe Vosgian Gymnasium that he was the discoverer of the
New World, for both René and the Gymnasium knew beyond any pos-
sible doubt the great discovery of 1492 by Cristoforo Colombo, and
the only excuse in their favor which can be given is, that Vespucci
claimed to have discovered the terra firma, the discoveries of Colombo
being confined to the islands, and that he succeeded in impressing on
those far away Lorrainers that fallacious idea.
THE NAME AMERICA. 663

As to the chrisiening of the New World with the name Americus, in
honor of Americus Vespucius, the Vosgian Gymnasium has gone out
of all rules, not only in giving the Christian name of a traveller or navi-
gator to a great country, but also in spelling his name, transforming
Amerige or Amerigo into Americ. Itis a well known rule that names
given to any great country newly discovered are either the family
name, if in honor of the discoverer, or the Christian name of some mem-
bers of royal reigning families. Wecan quote: ‘“Straitof Magellan,
Hudson Bay, Vancouver Island, Juan Fernandez Island, Colombia and
Columbia, Washington, Van Diemen Land or Tasmania; Cook, Laper-
ouse, Torres, and Davis Straits; Baffin Bay, Parry Islands, Kerguelen
Islands, Heard Islands, Crozet Islands, Tristan do Cunha Island, Ker-
madec Island, Bougainville Island, Lord Howe Island, Fernando do
Noromha Island, Grinnell Land, Wilkes Land, etc.; and on the other
side: Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, Victoria, Philippine
Islands, Queen Charlotte Islands, Charlestown, Charles River, Cape
Charles, Jamestown, James River, Isabel Island, Port Adelaide, Terre
Louis Philippe, Franz Joseph Land, ete.

If the explanation of the Vosgian Gymnasium is accepted the only
exception to the rule is a continent covering a hemisphere,—that is to
say the greatest geographical fact existing, and that in the face of a fact
admitted by everybody, even the Vosgian Gymnasium in the Ptoléme
of 1513, that Cristoforo Colombo discovered the New World.

The name Amerigho, or Amerigo, or Amerige, which are the three
variations in spelling known until 1507, would give in Latin: Amerigo-
nius, Amerighius, Amerigo, or even Amerige, but not Americus. Jean
Basin, in making such a lapsus linge, must have been influenced and
entirely directed by the aboriginal name of Amerrique, which reached
Europe four years before, and had time to spread as a name of a coun-
try and a tribe of Indians rich in gold, for in 1503 Colombo and his one
hundred and fifty seamen returned from Cariai and Carambaru on the
Mosquito Coast. Being assured by some one, perhaps directly by Ves-
pucci himself, or indirectly through Laurent Phrisius (Fries) of Metz,
an attaché to the service of the Due of Lorraine; the canon Jean Basin,
—an enthusiast like all poets, and a master in the art of eloquence and
fine writing,—perceiving the analogy between the christian name of
Vespucci, Amerigho, and more especially Amerige, and the somewhat
popular name of Amerrique, Basin thought that a part of the New World
was already named after the Christian name of Vespucci, and instead
of proposing to call the New World Vespuccia, as he ought to have
done, he called it America. A poetical creation due to a too great im-
aginative power. Beside the erroneous notion of the discovery of the
New World by Vespucci, Basin committed another error, that the name
Amerrique must be derived from Amerige, creating a confusion which
was. absolutely inexplicable, without the knowledge we have now of
the existence of a tribe of Indians called Amerriques, inhabiting a coun-

try rich in gold, and carrying round their necks mirrors of gold at the
time of Colombo’s visit in 1502.

The Vosgian Gymnasium is responsible for the ce but it is
certain that no one of the other members, except Basin, had any en-
thusiasm about it, or even any sympathy with it, for no one of them
uses the word America in any of their publications. The proof-reader
(castigator) Martin Hylacomylus (Waltzemiiller) wrongly credited as the
God-father of the New World, was not a partisan of the name America,
for he does not use it in any of his publications, not even on his map of
the New World of the Ptoleme of 1513, called only Terra nove, without
the name America anywhere. The canon Gauthier Lud, secretary of
the Due of Lorraine, did not use it in his: Speculi orbis declaratio, ete.,
1507, and Ringmann, the Vosgian poet and professor of cosmography
(geography) at St. Dié and afterward at Basel, never quoted it.

The only publiéation in which the name America is found, after the
proposition of the Vosgian Gymnasium in 1507, is in the “ Globus
mundi,” 1509, Strasburg, without name of author, but whichis attributed
to Jean Basin, the translator of the ‘“‘ Quatuor Navigationes,” and the
true God-father of the New World, and there it is found only once in
the chapter De Descriptio Terre.

IN 1515 THE NAME AMERICA IS ALREADY POPULAR.

John Shener, of Bamberg, in his “‘ Luculentissima quedam terre
totius descriptio, ete.,” published in 1515, makes the important and sig-
nificant remark that the name America was already accepted, used , and
popular. How can the name have been popular in 1515, when it has
been impossible to find it printed on a single map, and in no other books
than the small and extremely rare pamphlets of the Cosmographie Intro-
ductio and the Globus mundi? To be sure, some maps with the name
America may have existed then; but not one of them has reached us,
all having been destroyed, for the preservation of maps is more diffi-
cult than the preservation of pamphlets, especially when the maps are
on a large scale. Only during the first quarter, and even half, of the
sixteenth century all the printed maps were small, on account of the ma-
terial difficulties in their engraving and the writing of names on them ;
and their preservation was facilitated by their publication in books in
which they were inserted, like the Ptolemeys. Large-scale maps existed
then in manuscript, and besides the map of Juan de la Cosa of 1500, the
map of Sebastian Cabot of 1544, and many others now existing in the
archives of Europe, we know with certainty that many more have been
destroyed or lost, among them all the maps of Vespucci and the first
map of Sebastian Cabot.

The only dated map we possess now with the name America, is the
one of Apianus (Pierre Bienewitz), inserted in the *“ Polyhistor” of
Solinus, 1520. The Ptoleme of 1522, of Strasburg, gave the same map,
with the name America. Laurent Frisius or Phrisius of Metz, is the
THE NAME AMERICA. 665

editor, and at the reverse of the folio numbered 100, he names Martin
Ilacomylus as the author of the map, and even of all the maps of that
new edition. But Ilacomylus had been dead for some time, and it is
almost certain that the name America was not put there by him, but
more likely by Laurent Phrisius himself, who was probably the medium
between Vespucci, Pierre Martyr d’Anghiera, and the Duc of Lorraine.

It is plain that the name America can not have been popular in 15195,
except that it has passed from mouth to mouth among illiterate people,
as the masses werethen. Shoener was a contemporary, well acquainted
with the discoveries of the New World, and it is impossible to accept the
idea that its popularity was an error on his part.

VESPUTIA AND CABOTIA.

Let us make a few suggestions in order to show the absolute impos-
sibility of referring to the christian name of Vespucci the origin of the
name America. If the rule to give the family name of the discoverer
to anew country had been followed—although Vespucci was not the
discoverer —Jean Basin and the Vosgian Gymnasium would have called
the New World Vesputia. Does any one entertain for an instant the
idea that the proposition of the Vosgian Gymnasium would have stood
any chance of being accepted, or even been the object of any discussion ?
or controversy? The proposition to call the northern part of the New
World Cabotia, in honor of Cabot, although sustained by the well proved
fact that Sebastian Cabot first discovered North America—at least
scientifically, for the Norsemen certainly anticipated his discovery by
several centuries—was never accepted and not even discussed.

AMERIGIA AND ALBERICIA.

If we say that the Vosgian Gymnasium and its leader Jean Basin, in
the matter of christening the new continent, were conscious that it was
well to diverge from the rule of using family names, and that it was best
to use the Christian name—although without a single precedent, even
in antiquity—why did they choose a name so different from the christ-
ian name of Vespucci, for if they followed the orthography of the dif-
ferent names before them, they ought to have called the New World
Amerigia (for Amerige), Amerigonia (for Amerigo), or Albericia (for Al-
bericus). To write those names and pronounce them aloud suffices to
show that they were not likely to be used by a majority of those who
were accustomed in one way or another, as traders, seamen, adventur-
ers, colonists, statesmen, or religious men, to speak of the new continent.

POETICAL LICENSE OF JEAN BASIN.

The assimilation of the Christian name of Vespucci, Amerige or
Amerigho, to the gold-mirror Indians Amerriques, or their country
Sierra Amerrique, is simply a fiction, in which Jean Basin took the
name of an Indian tribe and of a country of the New World and placed
666 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

it on Vespucci, either as a poetical license or as a sort of joke without
any consequence.

Unhappily the matter has been taken very seriously, more so than
the originator even thought of; for the Vosgian Gymnasium took very
quietly the correction that Vespucci was not the discoverer, and they
were prepared to do the same as to their naming of America from
Amerigho Vespucci; only the matter was considered as too trifling by
those interested in the question, such as the son of Colombo, to require
a correction. ‘The attribution of the discovery to Cristoforo Colombo
was considered sufficient ; and that the name of Amerrique has nothing
to do with Vespucci was so evident and such a matter of course that
nobody eared to correct the vagary of a Vosgian poet.

The name Amerrique continued to be used among the people, just
like the names Chrysé, El Dorado, Quivira, etc., and the map makers
wrote the name America as they pleased, on many places of the new
continent, without following in the least the proposition of the Vosgian
Gymaasium, which passed entirely unnoticed until found out more
than three centuries after by Alexander de Humboldt. If the geogra-
phers who constructed maps during the sixteenth century had thought
that the New World was named from the Christian name of Vespucci,
as that name varied according to the numerous pamphlets of his third
voyage and his “‘Quatuor Navigationes” into Alberico, Amerigo,
Amergio, Almerigo, Albertutio, Damerigho, Armenico, Morigo, some
of them would have certainly used such names as Albericia, Amerigia
Amerigonia, Amergia, Almerigia, Albertutia, Armenica, Morigia. But
the name America is ne varietur, without a single case of different spell-
ing, showing that Amerrique was in general circulation, and that they
made use of it without thinking if it was in honor of Vespucci or not.
“Le mot était dans lair,” as the French say for all popular expres-
sion, and all the variations of the Christian name of Vespucci have not
the slightest influence on it.

Little by little the aboriginal name of Amerrique and its derivative
America took possession, first of the maps, and afterwards of all the
chancelleries and state departments of all Europe, the Spanish one
included, without much thought about the injustice committed toward
Colombo, or any desire on their part to raise Vespucci above the very
small position he occupied as third-rate navigator.

The whole is an example of a sort of process of infiltration, coming
from the masses where it unconsciously originated, entirely outside of
the doing of a few Latinists lost in their books and manuscripts, and
which eventually covered half of the earth’s surface, carrying péle-méle
partisans and adversaries of Colombo and Vespucci, sure that in the
end truth will prevail over all false pretensions, obscurities, and errors.

After all the incorrect reference of the name of the New World to
Amerigho Vespucci has lasted a little less than four centuries, even less
than the forgetfulness which has kept in the background the discov-

eries of the Norsemen Bjarni and Leif Ericksen, at the end of the tenth
century; a small number of years when compared to the past human
history and its great future. The fourth centenarian anniversary of
the greatest event for the human race will be celebrated without the
feeling that the name of the New World is derived from a third-rate
navigator, without any claim to such an honor and to the detriment and
great injustice of the great discoverer, Colombo; but that it originated
simply from a tribe of Indians and a mountain range of the new conti-
nent itself. The name Amerrique is equal to and of as much poetical
beauty as Niagara, Ontario, Canada, Monongahela, Mississippi, Mis-
souri, Arkansas, Alabama, Dakota, Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
Cuba, Panama, Veragua, Chimborazo, Peru, Venezuela, ete.

VESPUCCI CHANGES THE SPELLING OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAME.

When Vespucci received a copy of the “Cosmographiz Introductio”
of St. Dié, at the end of 1507, he must have been more than gratified;
for not only in it he is qualified as the discoverer of the New World,
which very likely he wanted to be, but more, the name of Amerrique
was attributed to him, and that name was extended to the whole of the
new country. An ambitious man has seldom seen his desires so well
fulfilled.

If Vespucci had been ‘es mucho hombre de bien” as Colombo thought,
he would have taken proper steps to correct the very great errors com-
mitted by the Vosgian Gymnasium, and referred to Cristoforo Colombo
as the true discoverer of the New World; but notwithstanding that Ves-
pucci lived five years more, he did nothing of the kind, and instead we
see he did all he could to sustain the scheme of naming the New World
after him, by correcting the orthography of his Christian name. Until
then he wrote Amerigho, as is proved by his letter of 1492, the earliest
authentic autograph of him that we possess, while his other letter of
the 9th of December, 1502, addressed to the Archbishop of Toledo, he
signs Amerrigo, with a double r and the suppression of the h. (See
‘page 657.) That modification in the orthography of his Christian name
is “the end of the ear which sticks out” (le bout de Voreille qui perce).
Seeing the analogy of Amerigho and Amerrique, he did all he could to
bring his name as near as possible to the avoriginal name, without
identifying it entirely; for a complete identification might have been
detected at once, for there were still alive quite a number of Colombo
crews of one hundred and fifty seamen; and very cunningly he signed
himself Amerrigo, with a most attractive and prominent flourish
(paraph), using it until his death in 1512, as is seen in two or three
other signatures of him after 1508, preserved in the Casa de Contracta-
tion at Sevilla, and all written with the double r and the dropping of the h.

The Spanish historian J. B. Munoz, is the first who has observed the
double r in the signatures found by him in Spain; that strange and
unique spelling attracted his attention, without his being able to assign
668 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

any reason for it. Munoz was convinced that some intentional falsifi-
cation existed in regard to the voyages of Vespucci; and he was as well
as the other historian, M. F. de Navarrete, a believer in some sort of
fraud on the part of the Florentine. Alexander de Humboldt not know-
ing what to do with the double 7, thought it might be “a proof of eru-
dition” on the part ot Vespucci, quoting the opinion of Professor von
der Hagen of Berlin that ‘when in Italian Vespucci uses the double
r in signing Amerrigo, it is by assimilation of two consonants, it is
Amerrigo for Amelrigo (name of a bishop of Como in 865).” The main
difficulty in accepting such an explanation is that Vespucci did not
use it when he wrote in Italian and to Italians, as is proved by his let-
ter of Mantova, but only to Spaniards andin Spanish. After the many
researches of all sorts made in the archives and in published books and
documents, it is certain that the spelling of Amerigo with two 7’s is
subsequent to the christening of St. Dié in 1507. It is the most dam-
aging discovery made against Vespucci, which can not be satisfactorily
explained in any other way than to bring his Christian name as near as
possible to the Indian name of Amerrique.

SCHOENER VERSUS VESPUCCI.

By a strange occurrence, not rare however in the first discoveries of
lands and aborigines of the new continent, the name of the Indian tribe
and of their country was not printed in any pamphlet or book or writ-
ten on any map that we know of. It escaped the researches of all the
Americanists; even of Alexander de Humboldt, and it seems that
everything conspired to make good the triple errors of Jean Basin,
accepted and consolidated by Vespucci as much as he safely could.

It may be that Vespucci wrote on some manuscript map Tierra di
Amerriques, and that it was read Tierra di Amerigo, as Schoener has
accused him of doing in 1535. Johannes Schoener, born in 1477, at
Carlstadt, Lower Franconia, in Bavaria, died at Nuremberg in 1547.
He was an excellent geographer and well acquainted with all the dis-
coveries made during his time, asis amply proved by Dr. Franz Wieser, .
in his important book: *‘ Magalhaes-Strasse und Austral-Continent auf
den Globen des Johannes Schoener,” Innspruck, 1881. Certainly Schoe-
ner can not be considered as a detractor of Vespucci. He seems to
have acted with great honesty of purpose, saying only the truth of what
he heard about him; for in 1515, in his “ Luculentissima,” etec., he is
very friendly to Vespucci, saying that he discovered the New World in
1497 and that the name America was generally accepted and already
in great use. But when he was convinced of the great injustice done
to Cristoforo Colombo, the true discoverer, he did not hesitate to say
that he knew that Vespucci had written his name upon some maps.

There is no doubt that maps made by Vespucci existed at that
time ; for we know of their existence through his contemporaries Pierre
Martyr d’Anghiera and his nephew and heir, Juan Vespacci. Only, as
I have said before, it may be that instead of writing Tierra di Amerigo
THE NAME AMERICA. 669

upon them, he wrote Tierra di Amerriques, and that Jean Basin and
others made the mistake which led Schoener to make the accusation.
I believe that there is no reasonable doubt that there was some sort of
shrewd underhand practice by some one in the whole matter of the
attribution of the discovery of the New World to Vespucci, and in the
maintenance of the name Americ as his Christian name, when it is
Amerigho. Without going so far as to regard Vespucci as an im-
postor, it is difficult not to admit that he was a great diplomatist, what
we call now a shrewd politician, a tan fino in Italian, and that there
are reasons enough to consider him as a sort of mystificator.

COLOMBO AND VESPUCCI.

Cristoforo Colombo has the honesty and simplicity of a seaman who
has passed all his life before the mast; believing easily that others were
‘‘ hombre de bien,” if they had the reputation of being honest merchants.

Amerigho Vespucci has been during the greatest part of his life a
“ fiorentino merchante,” as he cailed himself, educated for the trade at
Florence and accustomed to all the little underhand ways of traders.
He was considered at Sevilla as an “ hombre de bien” in trade, and
his failure of success as a merchant confirms that view to a certain
extent.

Unfortunate in his speculations, he took at the end of his life to sea-
manship, as an astronomer, chart maker, captain, and pilot, and finally
he was appointed piloto major. He never had command of a single
expedition, and was after all a very secondary man in Spain or Portugal
where there were such great navigators as Colombo, Vasco de Gama,
Pinson, de la Cosa, Hojeda, Pedro de Ledesma, de Solis, Juan and Se-
bastiano Caboto, Diego de Lepe, the Cortereal, Cabral, de Bastidos,
Vergara, Coelho, ete.

But it is evident that ambition to be known as a great discoverer
and a navigator of renown took hold of Vespucci, soon after entering
into his new life; and he addressed his voyages to the King of Spain,
the King of Portugal, a Medicis in Paris, the perpetual gonfalonier of
Florence, and finally to the good René, King of Sicily and Duce of
Lorraine. The style of Vespucci is rather diffuse and pretentious, ‘i
vise & Veffet,” according to de Humboldt. He leans constantly towards
exaggeration, and boasts of having received patent letters from the
King of Portugal. The most exhaustive researches into the books,
which are all preserved in the archives of the Torre do Tombo, contain-
ing all the patent letters delivered by the kings of Portugal, have
failed entirely to show any trace of these; and even the name of Ves-
pucci has never been found in a single document in Portugal.

Everything pertaining to Vespucci, as a travellerand a navigator, must

_be received with some apprehension that it is either much exaggerated
or even untrue. We must remember that Vespucci was a Florentine,
a friend of a Medicis and of Soderini; a trader until forty-eight years
670 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

old; that he was living during a period when it was possible to be a
cheat and at the same time regarded as a‘ hombre de bien.” It was a
time which it is difficult to understand now, because the society of the
fifteenth century lived among troubles of all sorts, which influenced all
the ideas and relations of men; and the honesty of men during that
period can not be compared with our actual ideas on the subject. With
Cristoforo Colombo everything is clear and explained easily, while on
the contrary with Amerigho Vespucci everything is obscure, or even
clashes with well-known facts, and all the time his defenders or friends
are obliged to have recourse to suppositions and to throw the blame
upon others without the slightest proof and against plain facts. It is
going too far to say with de Humboldt that Vespucci is “ the victim of
a concourse of fortuitous circumstances,” and of “the exaggerations of
unskillfal and dangerous friends,” for it is evident that Vespucci him-
self did all he could to create those circumstances, and during his life
he never did anything to correct his ‘‘ unskillful and dangerous friends ”
of St. Dié, Strasburg, and Metz.

A name for a continent covering a whole hemisphere can not come as
a spontaneous generation, aud as Pasteur says, ‘‘ spontaneous genera-
tion” does not exist in nature norin philology. There is always a source
and a base, and until the re-discovery of a tribe of Indians called
Amerriques, formerly powerful, and who have always lived in a coun-
try rich in gold and close to the coast explored first by Colombo and
afterward by Vespucci, it was impossible to give a rational and satis-
factory explanation of the christening of the New World. A writer has
said with great pertinence, “The attribution of the name America to
Vespucci has been respected especially because there was no other
solution to oppose to it.”

After almost four centuries it is impossible to expect that every fact
should be sustained by authentic documents and indisputable proofs.
Many of the archives have been destroyed, and we are reduced often—
too often—to suppositions and probabilities. That the publication of
the * Cosmographiz Introductio” of St. Dié was directed against the
reputation of Cristoforo Colombo is an undeniable fact, and that some
secret lay at the bottom of itis plain enough. Nothing is truly known
as to how the French manuscript came into the hands of King René,
nor what part Vespucci took in the matter. We are reduced to in-
ferences from the known facts of Vespucci sending his accounts of his
voyages in all directions. His admirers and partisans are obliged to
make more suppositions and have given less probable explanations than
his adversaries, and the custom adopted of throwing upon others all the
manifest and glaring errors in order to take off all blame from
Vespucci is only a ‘‘dessein coupable @agrandir artificieusement le mérite
de Vespucct,”* at the expense of the veracity and knowledge of some
of his contemporaries.

-* Examen critique, vol. Y p 187
THE NAME AMERICA. 671

The name was not “accidentally created in the Vosges,”* as de
Humboldt thought; but the application to Vespucci of the indigenous
name Amerrique was wrongly made there. The name is not a creation
of the Vosgian Gymnasium, but only an erroneous assimilation to the
Christian name of aman having some similarity with it, against all the
rules of priority of discovery and of naming a great country in using
the Christian name of a, Piloto instead of his family name. After
the mistake had been made Vespucci took care to make it good by
altering the autography of his Christian name, changing his signature
of 1492, Amerigho, into Amerrigo after 1507 and until his death.

All the discussions among Americanists come entirely from their
ignorance of the existence of a tribe of Indians who call themselves
Amerriques, and who inhabit the Sierra Amerrique and the country rich
in gold, between Lake Nicaragua and the Mosquito coast. They were
confronted by such difficulties that it is a true chaos of dates, names,
pretentions of all sorts, patriotic rivalries, and futile explanations un-
worthy of the characters and profound science of some of their number.
If Varnhagen and d’Avezac, and more especially de Humboldt, had
known the existence of the Amerriques, the Sierra Amerrique, and
the gold region of the vicinities of Cariai and Carambaru, of the
lettera rarissima of Colombo, they would have given a very different
explanation, and instead of giving such weak and inadequate reasons
as they did they would have thrown a great deal more light upon the
matter than I have been able to do, for | have no pretention of being
an Americanist, and even less a scholar, being only a practical travel-
ling geologist.

RESUME.

We have the following authentic fa2ts:

(1) On the 30th of December, 1492, Vespucci wrote a letter from
Sevilla, preserved at Mantova, in the Archives Gonzaga, signed Ameri-
gho Vespucci, merchante fiorentino in Sybilia.

(2) In the last voyage of Christoforo Colombo he staid from the 25th
of September to the 5th of October, 1502, with his 150 companions, at
Cariai (Rio Rama) and Carambaru (Rio Blewfields) among Indians wear-
ing gold mirrors round their necks. The localities of the mouth of the
Rios Rama and Blewfields are so near the country occupied now by the
the Amerrique Indians and the Sierra Amerrique, and the proved existence
there of an area of gold mines, altogether make it certain that Colombo
and his 150 seamen heard the name Amerrique and used it at their re-
turn to designate some of the Indian tribes and a country rich in gold.

(3) First letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo Pier Francisco di Medicis, pub-
lished at Paris, in 1504o0r 1505, with the name Albericus Vesputius.

(4) Second letter of Vespucci to Pietro Soderini, published at Pescia,

672 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

(5) Jean Basin, of St. Dié, uses the names of Amerige and Americus
in translating from the French into Latin the second letter of Vespucci,
entitled, Quatuor navigationes ; and the Vosgian Gymnasium proposes
in 1507 to name the New World America, in honor of its discoverer
Amerige Vespucci.

(6) On the 9th of December, 1508, Vespucci wrote a letter to the Arch-
bishop of Toledo, lately published in fae-simile by the Spanish Govern-
ment, signed Amerrigo Vespucci, Piloto mor (major).

(7) From 1508 until 1512, the date of his death, two or three signatures
of Vespucci have been found in Spain, all written with the double r and
without the letter h, Amerrigo instead of Amerigho of 1492, showing a
willful alteration in the spelling of his Christian name, after the chris-
tening of the New World in his honor, at St. Dié, in 1507.

(8) In 1515, Shoener says that the name America is generally used to
designate the New World.

(9) The first map, with an authentic date, on which the name America
has been found, is the map of Apianus, in the Polyhistor of Solinus in
1520.

(10) In 1533, twenty-one years after the death of Vespucci, Schoener,
an astronomer and geographer of good standing and just reputation, ac-
cuses Vespucci of having written his name on charts; but he did not
say how the name was spelled. The Americanist Henry HUarrisse
thinks that Shoener ‘had fastened on the memory of Vespucius the
odious charge of having artfully inserted the words Terra di Amerigo
in charts which he has otherwise altered.”* Vespucci may have inserted
Terra di Amerriques, an exact name, very closely allied to the new spell-
ing of his Christian name Amerrigo, and which has led Schoener to
make the accusation. The exact expressions used by Schoener are:
‘¢ Americus Vesputius maritima loca Indiz superiores ex Hispaniis nav-
igio ad occidentem perlustrans, eam partem qu superioris Indiz est,
credidit esse Insulam quam a suo nomine vocariinstituit” (In: Joanis
Schoeneri Carolostadti opusculum geographicum ex Diversorum libris, etc.,
etc., Norica, Novembris xxxiii).

No maps made by Vespucci have been found, although we know that
he made some.

One thing is certain, it is that Vespucci did not discover the New
World, and another fact is also certain, that Amerrique is an indigenous
name. From the central part of the continent, just about the middle,
the name Amerrique or Amérique in French or America in Latin
extended first southward and then northward, until finally we have the
Three Americas.

Geographically the name Amerrique has never varied, the Latin name
America and the French Amérique have always been spelled without any
changes among the letters on all tue maps and charts; while, on the
contrary, the Christian name of Vespucci had varied from Amerigho to

ee os

THE NAME AMERICA. 673

Amerrigo, according to his own signature, and has taken all the forms
and combinations imaginable between Albericus and Morigo.

To conclude, I shall quote a sentence taken from the life of Louis Pas-
teur: ‘ All new discoveries bring into the ideas generally used until then,
a change which is accepted by some with joy, while others resist, be-
cause it deranges all their old habits.” (JI. Pasteur, Histoire @un savant,
ete., p. 341, Paris, 1883); which applies exactly to this case. Almost all
Americans and all the Spaniards have accepted with joy the idea that
the New World was not named for Vespucci, who has no claim whatever
to such an honor, but that the beautiful name of Amerrique belongs to a
tribe of Indians and to a range or sierra of the central part of the conti-
nent, discovered and first explored by Cristoforo Colombo. A few Amer-
icanists, disturbed in their old habit of proclaiming in books, in pam-
phlets, or in speeches, that the new continent has been called after Amer-
igho Vespucci, do not like it, for it is disagreeable to them to see all they
have published or said replaced by something more rational and natural,
of which they. had not the smallest idea, or even thought of for one instant,
and their resistance is natural enough. I expected it from the time I
wrote my first paper on the Origin of the Name America, published in
March, 1875, in the Atlantic Monthly ; and nothing that has been said
by a few critics and reviewers in the United States, in Italy, and in Ger-
many has surprised me. But time will show who is right and I trust
fully to the good sense of the people.

The name of the New World was taken from the mountain range and
Indian tribe at the center of the continent, and brought into general use
by the people who had been there, and the people will now see who has
the correct view as to the origin of the name.

PROGRESS OF ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA
DURING 1888.

BY CYRUS ADLER, PH. D.

The study of oriental science has had a remarkable development in
America during the past decade, and has at the same time taken on an
almost entirely new aspect. Under the lead of Professor Whitney, and
of the men whom he inspired, the Indian branch of oriental studies has
in the past given—and still continues to give—many valuable contribu-
tions to science, and holds an almost unique position towards the Old
World in the circle of philological study.

Investigation in the field of Semitic languages and archeology, on
the other hand, was carried on mostly by the way, and in spite of a few
valuable contributions the publications in that line were, as a rule, not
important. The year 1883 marks a new era for these studies in America
with the establishment of regular courses in Semitic languages (inelud-
ing Assyrian inscriptions) at two of our great universities, Harvard and
Johns Hopkins. Most of the other important seats of learning have
followed this departure, so that in 1886 it was already possible for the
eminent French archeologist, M. Joachim Menant, to say that the most
serious efforts in this line are now concentrated in America.*

The year 1888 was one of great moment to oriental science in this
country. Possibly no stronger evidence of the interest had for these
studies could be afforded than the determination of the publishers of
the series of text-books known as Porta Linguaruwm Orientalium to put
an English translation on the American market; a confirmatory inci-
dent is the selection of an American member of the board of editors of
the Zeitschrift fiir Orientalische Bibliographie, Prof. R. J. H. Gottheil, of
Columbia College.

A number of gentlemen of Philadelphia equipped and sent out a
party to explore and conduct excavations in Mesopotamia, under the
auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. Considerable difficulty
was experienced in procuring from the Turkish authorities the requisite

permission to dig, and at the close of the year the party proceeded
southward to Niffer. Itis likely that work will be continued during the
coming year.*

The American Oriental Society, at its meeting in Philadelphia, took
a step which may lead to important results. A resolution was adopted
and a committee appointed to obtain information and make a report in
May, 1889, on the feasibility and utility of the preparation of a catalogue
of oriental manuscripts in America. Suchta catalogue, if it could be
made complete, would be of the greatest service to American oriental
scholars, whose chief drawback lies in the fact that their materials for
work are scattered over the entire country.

The University of Pennsylvania has acquired a collection of cuneiform
originals (briefly described by Dr. Robert F. Harper in Hebraica, Vol.
V, pp. 74-76), and also a collection of casts of Assyrian objects in the
British Museum.

The National Museum is steadily pursuing its policy of collecting
copies of Assyrian and Babylonian objects preserved in this country.
An exhibit of specimens in the field of Biblical Archeology was
set up in the Government exhibit at the Centennial Exposition of
the Ohio Valley held at Cincinnati. An interesting collection of casts
of Assyrian and Egyptian objects has been received from the Berlin’
Museum and a working oriental library is being collected in the Smith-
sonian Institution for the use of the oriental section, and of oriental
scholars visiting Washington.

Possibly the first German journal in the field of oriental philology,
to be published with the aid ofan American learned body is the Beitrdge
zur Assyriologie und Vergleichenden Semitischen Sprachwissenschaft, which
willappear mit Unterstiitzung der Johns Hopkins Universitat zu Baltimore,
edited by Prof. Friedrich Delitzsch, of Leipzig, and Prof. Paul Haupt, of
Baltimore.

Americar scholars have contributed to most of the important journals
in the field of oriental science published abroad, and a number of for-
eign scholars, among whom may be mentioned Canon Cheyne, of Ox-
ford, Prof. G. Maspero, Mr. W. M. Flinders Petrie, Mr. Theo. G. Pinches
of the British Museum, Prof. George Rawlinson, Prof. A. H. Sayce of
Queens College, Oxford, Dr. Hugo Winckler, of Berlin, and the late
Prof. William Wright, of Cambridge, have sent contributions to Ameri-
can journals.

The rangeof topics covered by American orientalists comprises: As-
syro-Babylonian language, art, history, and religion; Armenia; Budd-
hism and Sanskrit; China; Cyprus; Egypt; Hittites; Japan; Jews
and Judaism (so far as they bear on the history of the orient); modern
oriental languages; Mohammedanism and Arabic ; Old Testament and

The present report is the first attempt made in this country to pre-
sent in brief the work of oriental scholars during one year. It is nee-
essarily imperfect partly because of its novelty and for lack of assist-
ance on the part of scholars throughout the country. Many of the
papers mentioned in the bibliography could not be described because
they were not accessible.

* ASSYRIOLOGY.

Cyrus Adler showed that two classes of Assyrian verbs weak in the
third stem consonant, and usually confounded, were capable of sharp
differentiation; criticised the neglect of Assyrian in the article on
Semitic languages in the Cyclopedia Britannica, and suggested that
a certain class of Syriac verbs (the saphel) might not be organic forms;
described the views of the Babylonians concerning life after death;
some of the oriental objects in the National Museum, among them an
Ethiopic version of the Gospels in the Grant collection; the German
expedition tosouthern Babylonia; the Tell-Amarna tablets in the Brit-
ish Museum; and announced to the American Oriental Society, on behalf
of the Semitic Seminary of the Johns Hopkins University, the purpose
to publish a complete edition of the life and writings of Edward Hincks,
subjoining a tentative bibliography of Hincks’s works.

Edgar P. Allen offered some new translations of the inscription of
Tiglath-pileser I. In columns TI 31-2, 1 25, and vit 34 he reads zér
sangiti; and in 11 66 gammaréa irhiti, “swift veterans;” he also made
a conjecture which, if established, would present the unique instance of
an Assyrian king mentioning an unsuccessful campaign.

Francis Brown explained why the religious poetry of the Semitic
cuneiform monuments is Babylonian rather than Assyrian; translated
a number of Babylonian penitential psalms, and drew comparisons
with the corresponding portions of the Old Testament. He pointed
out the identification of the names of the kings mentioned in Genesis,
chapter XIV, discussed the question of the capture of Samaria, disputing
Delitzsch’s opinion that it was captured by Shalmaneser, and attempted
to harmonize the statements of the Bible (Is., xxxvii, 38), Alexander
Polyhistor, and the Babylonian chronicie with reference to the murderer
of Sennacherib. He gave notes on the Tell-Amarna tablets, discovered
in 1887 in middle Egypt. One of the most surprising facts brought to
light by these new tablets is the extent to which the cuneiform charac-
ter and the Babylono-Assyrian language were employed in Western
Asia.

Robert F. Harper published text and translation of the cylinder of
Hsarhaddon, and described his visit as a member of the University of
Pennsylvania exploring party to Zinjirli, where a German expedition
under Dr. Human has been’ excavating with most valuable results.

Paul Haupt described modern researches in Assyria and Babylonia ;
the development of the Assyrian writing; published the text of the
678 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

twelfth tablet of the Nimrod Epic; re-collated the whole of the poem ;
gave a new translation of the first column of the Deluge tablet on the
basis of recently found fragments; discussed the dimensions of the
Babylonian ark (=120 half cubits, 110 feet, for both the depth and
width, and 600 half cubits, 540 feet, for the length); and developed a
theory of the Assyrian prefix na.

Morris Jastrow discussed the Assyrian word kudiru, which he con-
nected with the ring of the sun-god and the biblical and later Hebrew
kaddur ; reviewed Parti of Delitzsch’s Assyrian dictionary, offered trans-
lation of some passages in the monolith inscription of Shalmaneser II,
and described ancient Babylonian cemeteries.

M. L. Kellner gave a new translation of the standard inscription of
Asurnazirpal, and compared and discussed the Babylonian and Old
Testament accounts of the Deluge.

David G. Lyon showed the development of the Assyro—Babylonian
religious conceptions by a collection of the prayers appended to the
royalinscriptions. He proved from a statistical study of the Pantheon
of Asurbanipal (668-626 B. C.) that this king mentions most frequently
Assur, the national god, and Istar, the goddess of war, and that he
exhibited a marked tendency to invoke a group of twelve deities, not
the same, however, which preside over the twelve months. He also
called attention to some parallels between the Assyrian inscriptions
and the Old Testament.

S. H. McCollester deseribed his trip from Bagdad to Babylon and
Mosul, the site of ancient Nineveh, with an account of the excavations,
explorations, and discoveries made there.

J. A. Paine gave a discussion of the eclipse in the seventh year of
Cambyses, based on T. G. Pinches’s paper, ‘‘An astronomical or astro-
logical tablet from Babylon” (Babylonian and Oriental Record, August,
1888). This tablet is either the original or a copy of the text from
which Ptolemy (in the Almagest) derived his information of the fifth
eclipse which he enumerates (July 16, 523 B. c.). In this text we
meet for the first time the Assyrian word irihu Hebrew idreah “moon.”

Theophilus G. Pinches, of the British Museum, contributed to the
New York Independent an article entitled, “An old Babylonian letter,”
being a translation and commentary on a tablet in the British Museum,
S+375. )

Zenaide A. Ragozin wrote a brief history of Media, Babylonia, and
Persia, from the fall of Nineveh to the Persian war. Especial attention
is given to the religion of the Parsees.

A. H. Sayce described in the New York Independent the literary
correspondence between Asia and Egypt in the century before the
Exodus, being an account of some of the Tell-Amarna tablets.

S. Alden Smith has carried on his studies in Assyrian letters, publish-
ing a number of new texts; described Assyrian report tablets and the
progress of Assyrian study, and criticized Delitzsch’s Assyrian dic-
tionary.
ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 679

William Hayes Ward concludes that there is no clear evidence, on
Assyrian and Babylonian seals, of human sacrifice. He considers the
so-called gate-god a conventionalized form of the sun-god coming out
of the gates of the east.

Hugo Winckler translated in Hebraica a cuneiform text describing
the building of Nebuchadnezzar’s artificial reservoir. One inscription
records that the royal canal was built because the river Euphrates had
departed from the city of Sippar.

D. A. Walker gave a historical sketch of the reign of the Assyrian
king Asurbanipal.

BUDDHISM AND SANSKRIT.

A. H. Edgreen wrote a criticism of Van den Gheyn. His conclusion
is that of the thirteen roots which have been referred to the eighth
class of verbs in Sanskrit five are fictitious, and the remainder must be
referred to the fifth class.

T. B. Forbush described the Hindu doctrine of death and immortality.
The early Hindus had no dread of death. The future life was a joyous
one, when all good people reap the reward of virtue. The terrible
conception of hell is no part of the primitive Vedic faith. The funda-
mental postulate of Hindu ontology is that the soul is eternal. It is not
born, it can not die, and is itself changeless. At different times it wears
different garments; sometimes it assumes the form of a man, sometimes
the disguise of an animal, and sometimes it is clad in the robes of a
spirit of light.

James T. Hatfield edited a Vedic text on omens and portents from
two MSS. in the British Museum.

E. W. Hopkins continued his inquiry into the conditions of civiliza-
tion in the Hindu middle age from the point of view of the ruling power
or warrior caste, and discussed the quantitative variations in the Cal-
cutta and Bombay texts of the Mahabharata.

A. V, W. Jackson called attention to a new reference in the Avesta
to “the life-book” hereafter.

S. H. Kellogg discussed the origin of certain Rajput forms of the
substantive verb in Hindi.

David Ker described Burmah’s mighty river and the capital cities of
the past, the old caverns, site and great temple of Moulmein, Lower
Burmah; a trip by rail up the Himalaya; temples and Buddhist
shrines that have been used as fortresses in times of war; the street
scenes and play-houses of Rangoon, the Liverpool of Burmah, and the
famous Shway Dagohn of Rangoon, the golden pagoda of Burmah;
also a trip among the Circassian mountains.

Edward A. Lawrence gave an account of his visit among the mis-
sionary stations in South India. Churches and Christian worship are
described. The population of South India is largely aboriginal, of
Dravidian stock. The social institutions are primitive and interesting
to the student of early customs.
680 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

Henry C. Lea in a note on Emerson and the Katha Upanishad referred
to a notice of Mr. W. 8. Kennedy ealling attention to a passage in the
“ Katha Upanishad ” which furnished Mr. Emerson the initial thought
in his mysterious stanzas on “ Brahma.”

H. W. Magoun treated of the Asuri Kalpa, a witchcraft practice of
the Atharva-Veda. Asuri is the black mustard of India, and it was
used in this rite to make an image of some person whom it was desired
to overcome or destroy by magical practices. Mr. Magoun prints
text, critical notes, extracts from the Scholiast, translation and a com-
mentary.

Raj Coomar Roy corrected various misapprehensions concerning child-
marriage in India. The boys and giris, though married in infancy, are
never allowed to live together until the girl reaches puberty. This
being the case, and marriage ordained by God, it fulfills the twofold
object of the procreation of children, and a remedy against sin; it
even fulfills a third object, viz, mutual society. There is great igno-
rance among Europeans in regard to the position of Hindu women,
which is by no means that of slavery.

W. W. Rockhill described the Lamaist ceremony of “making of mani
pills.” During the entire process no one is permitted to approach who
has used meat, spirits, garlic, tobacco, or other impure objects. The
process is sometimes one hundred days in length (consisting of a very
careful preparation of the pills, which are made of flour and scented
water), followed by a period of meditation and prayer. He discussed
the use of skulls in Lamaist ceremonies, which is at present twofold :
(1) as an offering to Tsepamed, who is represented as holding in his
hands a skull filled with ambrosia; (2) as a receptacle for the wine or
other liquid offered to the gods.

Justin A. Smith gave a summary of the ancient literature of the
- East. He treats of romance and drama, the Pankatantra, the Sakoon-
tala ot Kalidasa, and Hindu fiction in general; of Hindu epic and my-
thology, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana; of the Iranian script-
ures, the Zend-Avesta of Zarathustra, adding notes on Persian and
Iranian history; of the Shah-Nameh and the Bundehesh; of Buddhism
and the teachings of Buddha; and of Chinese literature, especially the
works of Confucius and Mencius. ,

W. D. Whitney wrote a review of the second volume of Eggeling’s
translation of the Catapatha Brahmana, and brought out a new edition
of his Sanskrit grammar.

CHINA.

W.S. Ament discussed tne ancient coinages of China. Starting with
the assertion that the Chinese were the inventors of coined money, he
investigated, specifically, (1) the composition of Chinese coins; (2) the
mode of their casting; (3) their inscriptions; (4) their form.

Adele M. Fielde described some Chinese mortuary customs. The
obsequies of a parent are reckoned the most troublesome affair in hu-

man experience among the Chinese, and, therefore, when they wish to
declare the extreme vexatiousness of any piece of work, they say, ‘ It
is more trouble than a funeral.” Infants are buried summarily, with-
out coffins, and the young are interred with few rites; but the funerals
of the aged, of both sexes, are elaborate in proportion to the number
of the descendants and to their wealth.

Elizabeth P. Gould describes the result of Yung Wing’s efforts to
raise the standard of education in his native country during the last
thirty years. It was through his influence that students were sent to
America to be educated. One of these was Yan Phou Lee, whose bi-
ography is given on the basis of his book, ‘‘ When I was a boy in
China.”

W. A. P. Martin gave an account of diplomacy in ancient China.
The doctrine of extraterritoriality was unknown; no agent was a min-
ister plenipotentiary, and the sovereign always held himself free to dis-
avow the acts of his representative; there were no resident ministers,
only envoyés extraordinaires. He made a translation of the devotional
portion of a pictorial sheet engraved and published by the Buddhist
high priest in charge of the Pas-én Temple; found traces of the philo-
sophie ideas of Descartes in the Chinese thinkers of the eleventh cent-
ury, and the same views among them concerning filial duty that are
advanced by Plato.

S. A. Stern described domestic customs in Japan and China, the
business habits of the people, their dress and amusements.

H. W. Warren described a journey on the Yang-tze-kiang, with some
geographical and social notes. Canton, he says, is a thoroughly English
place. The architecture is imposing and solid. It is a little London
planted in the distant East.

CYPRUS.

W. H. Goodyear described the Cypriote sculptures in the Metropoli-
tan Museum; and in a note to the Critic, April 18, corrects some mis-
apprehensions in the Critic’s notice of his paper published in the Amer-
ican Journal of Archeology on the Egyptian origin of the Ionic capital
and the anthemion.

EGYPT.

The various articles on the Tell-Amarna tablets, discussed under
Assyriology, all bear more or less on Egyptian history.

Lysander Dickerman discussed Groff’s discovery of the names of Ja-
cob and Joseph on the Egyptian monuments, holding that Grofi’s in-
ference was not warranted.

William N. Groff, who continues his residence abroad, speaks of
q. l. uw. j. on an Egypto-Aramean papyrus, which he identifies with the
Egyptian Kelbi, a sort of wine; published in hieroglyphic the romance
of the two brothers, with a translation and commentary ; discussed the

pronouns in Egyptian, and discovered the names of Jacob-El and Jo-
seph-E], in lists of defeated nations, transported to Egypt in the time
of Tuthmosis II], about 1700 B. c.

Lewis G. Janes reviewed Edward Naville’s edition and translation
of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. <A careful study of this book, with
an unbiased scrutiny of the monuments and inscriptions, reveals coin-
cidences of notable change and development in the Eyptian doctrine of
the future life. Mr. Janes follows the development from the archaic
period down to the days of St. Paul.

G. Lansing, in two articles on Egypticity and Authenticity of the
Pentateuch, discussed the Biblical narratives of the lives of Joseph and
Moses (Genesis xxxix, et seq.) with reference to the local hints and lin-
guistic usages; in other words, the Egyptian cast and character of the
narraratives. He concludes that the narratives must have been written

at or near the time the events narrated occurred.
_ G. Maspero studied the Egyptian words which seem to apply to the
human soul and the places it inhabited after death. He pointed out
that the views of the Egyptians with reference to death and a future
state underwent many changes.

Ch. E. Moldenke edited the first part of a new edition of the so-called
tale of two brothers, or the D’Orbiney papyrus.

Howard Osgood made an English translation of M. Philippe Virey’s
French translation of the Papyrus Prisse, “The Oldest Book in the
World ;” described society, ethics, and religion in Egypt before 2000

Aug. de Plongeon recalled the fact that the Egyptian Sphynx is
a riddle still unsolved and its age unknown. He directed attention
to certain striking analogies existing between the Egyptian Sphynx
and the leopard with human head that crowns the mausoleum of Prince
Coh at Chichen-Itza (Yucatan).

C. A. Siegfried described a tour from Tripoli to Alexandria. Tripoli
is a typical Arabian town with all the evils of Moslem misrule, wretch-
edness, and neglect. From Tripoli to Egypt is an agreeable change.
The social and mercantile condition of Alexandria is described. He
gives an account of his experience of a journey to the Dalmatian coast
and Montenegro, describing the political, social, and archaeological
features of the country.

Cope Whitehouse discussed the map of Joseph the Fayumi and the
Raian Basin, in the light of the survey made during 1887-88.

i. L. Wilson described “ the great Pyramid” of Cheops, narrates the
incidents of an ascent and descent; pictures the views from its summit
and hills, discusses its history and the curious speculations to which it
has given origin; he wrote an illustrated paper on the temples of Egypt.
No perfectly preserved Egyptian temple is in existence, but by study-
ing the various parts in the existing examples an adequate idea can
be obtained of what one of these structures must have been in its com-
pleteness.
ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 683
HITTITES.

William Hayes Ward restored and described some imperfectly pub-
lished Hittite monuments from Carcemish (Jerablis), which appeared
in the London Graphic December 11,1880. These monuments had been
rephotographed by the Wolfe expedition to Babylonia.

JAPAN.

S. Beale described Japanese pictures at the British Museum. Japan
possesses works of art which from its own particular point of view equal
any school of European painting; this art is the outcome of that of
China. It dates back to the fifth century A.D. All pictures are essen-
tially decorative ; light and shade are unknown quantities, and linear
perspective completely ignored. He also gave an account of Japanese
ivory carvings; showed the potent influence of tobacco in the decora-
tive art of that country. Every domestic occurrence is represented in
ivory, and many of their classic romances are illustrated in the bronze,
porcelain, and lacquer work.

William Elliot Griffis described Japanese artists and artisans; with
illustrations from drawings by a Japanese artist. Among things un-
expected in Japan, none strikes the visitor or resident more than the
enviroment of art and its maker; the critic and historian, who is yet to
write the story of art in Japan, will discriminate between what is bor-
rowed and what is original. The folding fan, the arts of lacquering,
sword-making, cloissonné on porcelain, and some of the methods of dec-
orating are of native origin. Other works of art are mostly imported.

EK. H. House gives a history of the tariffin Japan. The first effective
commercial treaty with Japan was negotiated in 1858 by Townsend
and Harris, upon terms which in general were not disadvantageous to
the unsophisticated people with whom they were dealing. If they had
taken the precaution to insure the absolute termination of the treaty
at a proper date, all would have resulted as they desired, but under the
circumstances it has proved disastrous to Japan and proportionately
favorable to the western powers. He also discussed foreign jurisdiction
in Japan. The authors of the early treaties never intended to super-
sede the laws of Japan by those of their own nations. The inflation of
arrogant pretense, the multitude of entangling and bewildering compli-
cations, the aggregation of gross abuses, and the offensive domination
over the national rule which have been exercised in later years have
no other basis than the narrow foundations of mutual assistance, stipu-
lated in the treaties of Harrisand Townsend. The “ diplomatic co-oper-
ative policy” of European nations has put Japan in ties which hold her
in political and moral enslavement.

S. KE. Ives describes a Japanese magic mirror. Itis a circular, metal-
lic band-mirror, having figures in relief upon its back; the reflecting
surface is highly polished, and reflects the face as well apparently as do
mirrors of silvered glass, but when it is used to reflect the direct rays

of a powerful light upon a screen the reflection shows the figures that
are at the back of the mirror. This peculiarity is explained by the fact
that there are irregularities in the convexity of the mirror which cause
an irregular reflection of the sun’s rays.

H. H.S. Thompson wrote on the women of Japan. They pride them-
selves on the fact that nine of the sovereigns of Japan have been wo-
men; that the chief deity in their mythology is a woman, and that the
keeper of the “divine regalia” is a virgin priestess. They say the
women of the early centuries had great mental and physical vigor, and
filled offices of public trust with dignity and honor. There are many
heroines whose names are renowned in Japanese classics, while instances
of woman’s valor, fortitude under suffering, and greatness in the hour
of persecution abound. The Japanese woman has a place all her own
in the world of letters. The evils in the position of women in Japan
are traceable to Buddhism.

JEWS AND JUDAISM.

S. Adler discussed the various forms of benedictions in use in ancient
times among the Jews. They fall into three classes: (1) After a physi-
cal enjoyment; (2) on special occasion or at particular localities; (3)
before fulfillment of a religious duty.

B. Felsenthal showed that the popular Sabbath hymn Leha dodt
was not composed by Judah ha-Levi, as Heine supposed, but was
written by Solomon Alkabitz ha-Levy, who lived in the sixteenth cen-
tury and died in the city of Safed, in Northern Palestine. He also
showed that the pronunciation of Jehovah for the name of God was first
employed in Germany in the sixteenth century.

A. K. Glover described the Jews of India. They are all offshoots
of Judah and not of the ten tribes. He also gave an account of the
Jews of the Chinese Empire.

kh. J. H. Gottheil continues his translation of Karpeles’s History of
Jewish Literature.

M. Jastrow, jr., treated of several Jewish grammarians of the middle
ages. Hayytg lived about the middle of the tenth century in Cordova,
though born in Fez. He wrote two grammatical works on Hebrew
verbs. In his studies he started from Arabic principles. From his
treatises his pupil, Ibn Ganah, worked out his elaborate grammatical
system. Do6nash ben Labrat’s only distinction is that he is the oppo-
nent of Saadia Gaon and of Menahem b. Sarig. He is the author of
two sharp polemical essays, the one containing a pointed criticism of
Saadia’s Arabic translation of the Bible, the other an attempt to dis-
countenance Menahem’s standing as a grammarian.

Alexander Kohut discussed the etymology of a number of talmudical
words.

H. C. Trumbull, in his history of the origin and development of the
Sunday school, devotes the first chapter to a history of the ancient
Jewish schools.
ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 685

The doctrines of the resurrection and of a world of the dead are
found among the oldest heathen religions of Chaldea and Egypt. How-
ard Osgood maintains against negative critics that the same doctrines
are taught in the Pentateuch, especially in the narrative of Cain and
Abel.

B. Pick discussed the Old Testament, passages applied Messianically
by the ancient synagogue, in Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel,
and the twelve minor prophets. His work consists in the collection of
quotations from the Midrashim with reference to the promised Messiah.
He maintains (Christ and the Hssenes) against Ginsburg and Frankel
that whatever points of resemblance critical ingenuity may emphasize,
the teaching of Christianity was in a direction opposed to that of
Essenism, and that the latter could have had no intentional connection
with the origin of Christianity. In describing the Therapeute, of
Egypt, a peculiar sect of Jewish ascetics, he points out agreements and
disagreements between this sect and the Essenes. The characteristics
of the two are so different that they can not be identical. Against Greetz
he maintains the genuineness of Philo’s Tracta, and contends that the
Therapeutz were Jews.

Aaron Wise discussed the origin of Jewish angelology and demon-
ology. He holds that it could not have arisen at the time of the Baby-
lonian captivity, but antedates it.

MISCELLANEOUS.

I. N. Fradenburg has undertaken to show the connection of certain
living religions of the Orient with the Jewish faith, and the connection
of certain others with Christianity. He treats of (1) the great re-
former of Asia, Buddha; (2) the old philosopher, Las-the, the contem-
porary of Confucius; (3) Confucius, his life, teachings, and his religious
system; (4) Brahmanism and Hinduism, its caste, doctrines, precepts,
and speculations.

I. H. Hall gave a note on a Rhodian jar in the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts ; on one handle is the eponym and name of Doric month, and
on the other the name of the manufacturer, owner, or exporter.

L. describes the Musée Guimet in Paris, which contains a collection
intended to teach the history of the characteristies of oriental religions.
The Christian and the Hebrew forms of worship are excluded ; there is
no other collection of the kind nearly so large, or so well adapted for
the study of the development of oriental and ancient civilization.

Allan Marquand described an archaic patera from Kourion, belong-
ing to the Cesnola collection ; the central medallion is missing; the cen-
ter zone represents a ander scene ; the scene figured upon is patera
seems to be the autumnal Adonis festival, in which honor was paid to
both Adonis and Aphrodite.

ity has a ground or standard of right, and therefore a reason for con:

duct, of which we find no trace in the ethical philosophers of Greece
and Rome. Acts are judged by their intrinsic and inherent nature, not
by their bearing on some ultimate end ; a fatal deficiency in the morals
of the classic ages was the relation of the sexes and the lack of purity
and permanence of domestic institutions.

S. D. Peet compared animal worship and sun worship in the East
and in the West. The worship of the sun was prevalent in different
parts of the world ata very ancient date. It was preceded by animal
worship; but it is more powerful and more extensive than animal
worship and grew out of it. The customs, habits, and language of
the races of northern Asia are compared, especially the Ostyaks, with
those of the aborigines of America. He discussed American religions
and the Bible, and thinks that there are many things which go to show
that there must have been a historic connection between the original
religions of America and the teachings of the Bible.

S. B. Platner, reviewed Myth, Ritual, and Religion of Andrew Lang.
A method of explaining the irrational in mythology has been here
worked out far more comprehensively and satisfactorily than by any
other writer.

MODERN ORIENTAL LANGUAGES.

Cyrus Adler showed the importance of the study of modern oriental
languages for a knowledge of the ancient tongues and for the improve-
inent of our consular service and increase of trade with the Bast.

MOHAMMEDANISM AND ARABIC.

The question, Why am I a Moslem? is answered by Ibn Ablis. There
is a universally wrong conception of Mohammedanism among Western
nations, but the more the religion of the Moslem is investigated the more
does it claim the respectful homage of those who study its teachings.
The Islam does not persecute any more than did or does Christianity.
Notwithstanding his extensive travels in the East and West, the writer
still clings to the five great duties of the true Moslem, and the six
great dogmas of faith; in them he finds all that is needed to discipline
the human soul to that condition which is expressed in the word
** Moslem ”—“ one who is resigned.” ‘I am a Moslem because [ recog-
nize in Islam one of the many avenues through which the Creator of
the universe leads his people to the temple of truth.”

G. Benton discussed Mohammedanism in Africa, with reference to
Canon Isaac Taylor’s statements, implying that Mohammedanism in
Africa is an almost unmingled and beneficial success, while Christianity
there is an undoubted failure. The replies of Canon McColl Bosworth
Smith show that Canon Taylor was partly right. The superior success of
Mohammedanism in Africa is due to the fact that it agrees better with
the material and practical which it is within the power of the crude
African mind to accept.
ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 687

Theodore Child gave a description of a visit to Constantinople. He
narrates his treatment by the custom-house officers, his visit to the ba-
zar, with notes on the municipal and social life of Stamboul. Guide-
books are of very little help to the visitor of Stamboul, at least, to a
man who really wants to know the life and social condition of the city.

A. L. Frothingham sketched the development and character of Mo-
hammedan education. The contrast between the liberal and the pro-
gressive Arab of the Khalifate, and the intolerent and fanatical part
of the East, are not to be lost sight of in a judgment of the culture of
Mohammedanism. He traces the development and character of Arab-
ian culture as influenced by the civilization of Byzantium, Syria, and
Persia; gives the curriculum of studies; names the three institutiors
of instruction (school, college, and mosque), and points out the strong
moral element in their education.

F. H. Hedge, in an article on Mohammedan Mysticism, affirms that
the recent account of the superior success, as compared with the Chris-
tian, of Mohammedan missions in Africa confirms the former estimate
of the prophet of Islam, whose claims were for the first time vindicated
by Thomas Carlyle in 1840, and M. Barthilemy St. Hilaire in 1865.
Mohammed borrowed much of his religion from Judaism, but, notwith-
standing that this is the dominant element, he favored an un-Jewish
mysticism. He compares Mohammed’s life with that of David. The two
most obnoxious features of ‘his religion, fatalism and the sensual char-
acter of his paradise, are found in the belief held by some branches of
the Christian church, and, on the whole, are grossly misunderstood.
He furnishes the biography of a saintly woman, Rabia, and closes with
a few extracts from Tholuck’s Anthology of Eastern Mystics (1825).

Thomas P. Hughes discussed the Moslem’s Bible, or Koran. Two
hundred and one millions receive and venerate the Koran as the word of
God. It is read more devoutly, more extensively, by the Moslems
than the Christian Bible by the Christians. The Moslem takes religion
seriously. The Koran contains some eighty thousand words, arranged
in one hundred and fourteen chapters, called soorahs. The finest col-
lection of ancient MSS. is in the library at Cairo. Whosoever can re-
cite the whole Koran from memory is dignified with the title of hafiz, or
protector of the faith. The early chapters are merely poetic effusions.
The Koran is not an historic book; five periods cau be distinguished in
its composition.

K. P. Sanguinetti related his impressions of Constantinople ; his jour-
ney to Batna, one of the French military outposts; an excursion to the
tomb of Sidi Okbar; an Arab marriage, and his experiences in the Arab
markets.

Lawrence M. Simmons gave a brief statement of the views of Philippi
and Wright on the separation which may take place between the so-
called defined and defining noun in Arabic, followel by a translation
from the celebrated “ Watchtire” of the late Nasif Al-Yazigi, showing
the treatment of this subject by a native grammarian.

C. H. Toy described some phonetic peculiarities of Cairo Arabic,
especially the Egyptian mute Gym, palatal q, and the pronunciation of
the dentals. In the Cairo pronunciation the old Arabic th and dh be-
come ¢ and d; in some cases the Cairo fricatives pass into sibilants.

George Washburn summarized the articles of the Mohammedan
creed. Islamism has for its base faith in the unity of God and in the
mission of his dearest servant Mohammed. The book of God which
descended last from Heaven is the sacred Koran. The first of the
prophets was Adam and the last Mohammed; the greatest of all is

Caroline R. Wright described the worship of the dervishes of Cairo.
The preliminary prayers over, the curtain of the entrance door is raised,
and giaours are admitted to the sanctuary. At this moment the chief
dervish and other dervishes were prostrate, with their heads on the
ground in the direction of meihrab, and for nearly half an hour they
continued kneeling, praying and bowing, rocking to and fro, reciting
the Koran in a ee nasal tone. Then follows the howling of the
litany, with its unison refrain Allah-hou, Allah-hou.

OLD TESTAMENT AND HEBREW.

Benjamin Wisner Bacon presented in tabular form the results of the
principal schools of higher Biblical criticism, including fragments and
portions assigned to editors, interpolators, compilers, and glossators.
His classification is: Priestly Law Book, P?; Ephraimite Narrative, F;
Judean Narrative, J; Law of Holiness, P'.

HK. C. Bissell published a work on Biblical Antiquities, for popular
use. It embraces the main facts under the classification of domestic,
civil, and sacred antiquities.

W.G. Blakie has published the first and second books of Samuel.
They belong to the series called the Expositor’s Library, based on the
plan of giving the substance of scripture in a running commentary or
connected narrative, which furnishes all needful explanations.

C. A. Briggs continued his studies on the forms of Hebrew poetry.
The tetrameters are measured by four beats of the accent, and are often
divided by a cesura into two halves. Examples are Psalm xlvi, 13;
2 Samuel i, 19-27; Exodus xv; Psalm Ixxxix. Tetrameters are not so
numerous as the pentameters. The pentameter is measured by five beats
of the rythmical accent; the cwsura usually comes after the third
beat. Examples are Le iii; Psalm exix; Jonah ii; Psalms
CXX, exxxiv (the dirge of Babylon) ; ian xlvii. The hexameter is a
double trimeter. Instances of hecameter are Proverbs xxxi, 12 ff; Psalm
exxxvii; Isaiah lx, and Jeremiah viii, 9.

T. K. Cheyne offers an emandation to Job iii, 14, and translates ‘“ to
build up ruined places.” ;

Howard Crosby asserts that the revised Old Testament is too much
a new edition of the old authorized version, and illustrates this by a
ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 689

passage from the book of Job (xxviii, 1-12), which, of all the Old Testa-
nent writings, needed the most thorough revision. Against Cheyne he
shows that the Cyrus inscription, and the statemeuts contained in Isaiah
xliv, 28, and xlv, 1-13, do not really contradict each other. Cyrus may
have treated Bel, and Nebo, and Merodach with the greatest courtesy,
and yet have sent the Jews back as a wise piece of policy.

James D. Dana discussed the cosmogony of Genesis in reply to Canon
Driver (Defense and Critique, Andov. Rev., 1887). He favors the stand
taken by Guyot, and holds that the fiats of Genesis did not produce
completed results, but initiated slowly developing processes.

T. G. Dashiel maintains that the Old Testament teaches practically
the doctrine of eternal existence.

Samuel Davidson. Notes on the Psalms: ii, 12; iv,3; vi, 2; viii, 2;
xil, 7; xvi, 3, render: as to the saints who are in the land and the no-
bles, all my pleasure is in them; xviii; xix; xxii, 17; xxv, 11; xxix, 2;
xxxil, 9, With bit and bridle their youth must be bound; they do not
come near thee otherwise; xxxvi, 13; xxxvii, 38; xxxix, 3; xlii, Oe xy;

Ixviti; Ixix; lxx; xxi; Ixxili, 4; Ixxiv, 19; Ixxvi, 5, and Ixxvii, 11,
17-20.

W. N. Davis characterized the Chokmah or Hebrew philosophy. — It
dates its development from the age of Solomon. It differs from the
Greek philosophy in taking for granted the existence of an omniscient,
omnipotent, and omnipresent God. Hebrew wisdom is inseparable
from morals; wisdom and right living are synonomous terms. The
best specimens of the Chokmah are found in Eeclesiastes and Job. In
discussing Job xix, 25-7, he holds there is no evidence that the word
“redeemer,” used in Job xix, 25, can be applied to Christ, “the
Redeemer.” The word Goel used here is avenger, blood relative. He
explains what a Goel is and translates verse 25. “I know that my Goel
lives and my vindicator will arise upon the earth; (26) and after my
sin is thus destroyed, and without my flesh (body) I shall see God.”

Marcus Dod’s edition of the Book of Genesis belongs to the series
called ** The Expositor’s Bible.”

G. C. M. Douglas reviews The prophecies of Isaiah, by T. K. Cheyne;
and Isaiah, his life, and times, and writings, by S. R. Driver. Douglas
does not agree with the position of either Cheyne or Driver, and gives
his reason at length; there is nothing to justify us in disbelieving the
universal and unbroken tradition which attributes them to Isaiah, the
alleged reasons being misconceptions.

J. F. Genung discussed the interpretation of the Book of Job. Many
of its difficulties are due less to original fault than to crude interpreta-
tion of them. The so-called debate-theory, with its assumed main sub-
ject, “the mystery of God’s providential government of men,” does not
result in an exposition so homogeneous as we could wish; it does not
reach the heart of the book. The problem of the book is doth Job fear

H. Mis, 142—---44
690 MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.

God for naught? And the solution of it is Job himself, the man Job.
The poem is an epic, not a drama. It is the epic of the inner life; as
such its significance extends far beyond national bounds to the universal
heart of humanity.

W. H. Green proposed a new nomenclature for the Hebrew tenses;
he prefers preterit and future as designations of the Hebrew tenses to
perfect and imperfect, and holds that these tenses primarily and prop-
erly denote the time of action, and not simply its mode as complete or
incomplete. He has re-edited his Hebrew grammar, first published
twenty-seven years ago; it has been revised throughout and the syntax
entirely recast.

W. R. Harper published Elements of Hebrew Syntax and discussed
the Pentateuchal question; he presented a detailed analysis of the
Hexateuch, in parallel columns, giving not only the chapters and verses
by sections as they are divided by critics, but also the topics of which
each section treats. An introductory note states the points (7) agreed
upon by the two schools. Then follow the facts and considerations
urged in favor of the analysis of Genesis i, 1,—xii 5, in sections.

Edward P. Humphrey (in Sacred History, from the Creation to the Giv-
ing of the Law) defends the traditional view of the Mosaic records.
The difficulties which are supposed to embarrass the Mosaic account of
the creation he classes as follows: (1) All those questions in which the
meaning of the text is fully ascertained and opposing sciences are im-
mature. (2) The problems in which natural science is mature and the
Bible is not understood. (3) Where the results of science are incom-
plete and proper explanation of the Bible is not yet reached.

M. Jastrow, sr., discussed the transposed stems in Talmudic, Hebrew,
and Chaldaic, especially the reduplicated stems, the so-called pilpels
and palpels of verbs and nouns.

K. Kohler criticised the arrangement and method of Jastrow’s Tal-
mudie dictionary, especially the tendency to give up derivations from
the Greek and find Semitic etymologies.

Thomas Lauris rendered Genesis xli, 32, ‘‘the dream was told or set
Forth to Pharaoh twice.”

G. F. Moore gave a sketch of the history of Semitic studies in this
country from the settlement of New England to about 1875. The author
describes the state of learning among the Puritans, and its gradual
decadence; then, at greater length, the revival of Biblical science in
the early part of this century, with brief biographical notices of Stuart
and other leading representatives of this movement; and gives, finally,
without any attempt at exhaustiveness, a survey of the more recent
literature. A second article is to contain a fuller account of the work,
of the last ten years. He pointed out some seeming evidence that the
supralinear system of vowels originated under Arab influence.

Henry Preserved Smith reviewed Victor Rysoels The text of Micah,
part I (1887), The book is one of realimportance. The text of Micah’s
ORIENTAL SCIENCE IN AMERICA. 691

prophecies is corrupt and must be corrected from the ancient versions.
He also discussed the value of the Targum to Jeremiah: in seventy pas-
sages, the Targum helps us to determine the text of the book of Jere-
miah. In fixing our Old Testament text we must not ignore this version.

W. O. Sproull holds that the native language of Abraham was
Aramaic, since he emigrated from Ur of the Chaldees to the land of
Canaan (Genesis, xi,31). It is probable, however, that he knew Hebrew
before he came into the land of Canaan, for there is no indication that
he had any difficulty in conversing with its inhabitants.

A. W. Thayer calls attention to the fact that Professor Graetz, of
Breslau, has prepared a revised text of the Massoretic Bible, which is
now awaiting publication.

PEDAGOGICS.

At the fall meeting of the American Oriental Society, Francis Brown
A. L. Frothingham, jr., W.H. Green, W. R. Harper, Paul Haupt,
Morris Jastrow, jr., D. G. Lyon, C. H. Toy, and W. H. Ward discussed
the history of Semitic studies in this country, and offered suggestions
for the future. The remarks were collected and published in Hebraica
with au introduction by Morris Jastrow, jr.

PERSIA,

Morris Jastrow discussed the plan of the Palace of Artaxerxes
Mnemon, compared it with the description of the Palace of Ahasuerus
in the book of Esther, and accepts M. Dieluafoy’s conclusion, that the
palace he discovered at Susa is the one described in the book of Esther,

SAMARITAN.

G. F. Moore described a fragment of a manuscript of the Samaritan
Pentateuch deposited by Grant-Bey in the Library of Andover Sem-
inary. The fragment contains Ex. viii, 16—xxx, 28; it is of the thirteenth
century, and apparently a part of the codex described by Rosen, Zeit-
schrift der Deutschen Morgenlindischen gesellschaft, xvili, 586.

SEMITIC PHILOLOGY.

E. P. Allen answered G. F. Moore’s objections to his former paper on
Semitic sounds and their transliteration. Allen’s theory is that the so-
called Semitic emphatic consonants are distinguished by a combination
of mouth position with the glottal catch.

G. F. Moore questions the theory that the distinctive characteristic
of the emphatic consonants is a combination of glottal catch with mouth
articulation,

SYRIAC.

Robert H. Beattie described the recent changes in life in Syria and
the new opportunities they bring to American scholarship and industry.

Syriac literature has been enriched by the discovery and description
of a number of unedited texts.

Isaac H. Hall described a manuscript recently acquired by the Union
Theological Seminary of New York, consisting of the service of obse-
quies, and introduced by the ritual of the washing of the dead, publish-
ing portions of the text with translation; a manuscript of the Peshitto
four Gospels, the property of Beloit College, Wisconsin, accompanied
by a manuscript of the traditions of the Apostles, text and translation
of which are given.

R. J. H. Gottheil published a manuscript containing a fragment of a
Porphyry in the Berlin Library ; a Syriac geographical chart; text of
Berlin manuscript tract on the Syriac conjunctions and a collation of a
text of a portion of the Targums ina map or manuscript in the Library
of the Temple Emanuel, New York.

G. F. Moore called attention to the fact that four of the British Mu-
seum Hebrew manuscripts with the Targum recently acquired from Yemen
are in this same hand, and together form a complete Bible; also to the
excellent character of the Targum text.

The New York Tribune of August 12, 1888, gave a description of a
Syrian commencement and the scenes attendant on the closing of the
American College at Beirut.

BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD.*

By ROBERT RIDGWAY.

Mr. PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN ORNITHOLO-
Gists’ Unton: When asked by the worthy president of our union to
prepare a memorial address upon the life and services to ornithology
of our great teacher and leader, Professor Baird, it was with many mis-
givings that the invitation with which I was thus honored was accepted ;
for, glad as I am to render what tribute I can to the revered memory
of a departed and beloved friend, the sense of my own inability to do
justice to such a subject has almost deterred me from the attempt.

The preparation of an address which shall consist essentially of new
matter is rendered particularly difficult by the circumstance that there
has already been published by Prof. G. Brown Goode, in Bulletin 20 of
the U.S. National Museum, an excellent biography of Professor Baird,
giving in detail a history of the principal events and chief results of his
life, together with a complete bibliography of his publications. Since
the present memoir is intended to deal more particularly with Professor
Baird as an ornithologist, the reader is referred for more general
information to Professor Goode’s admirable ‘ Biographical Sketch,”
from which are taken most of the chronological data and the occasional
quotations in the following prelude to what I have to offer from my
own personal knowledge of the life, labors, attainments, and personal
qualities of one who in history must hold a place at the head of Ameri-
can naturalists, and in the hearts of those who knew him a place which
none other can fill.

Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, Feb-
ruary 2, 1823. In 1834 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school at
Port Deposit, Maryland, and the following year to the Reading gram-
inar school. In 1837 he entered Dickinson College, graduating in 1840,
at the age of seventeen. The next several years were speiit in making

natural history studies, and in the study of medicine, including a
winter’s course of lectures at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
in New York, in 1842, though he never formally completed his medical
course. ‘In 1845 he was chosen professor of natural history in Dick-
inson College, and in 1846 his duties and emoluments were increased
by election to the chair of natural history and chemistry in the same
institution. July 5, 1850, he accepted the position of Assistant Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution, and October 3, at the age of
twenty-seven years, he entered upon his life work in connection with
that foundation—‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men,’ ”

Mr. Goode informs us that “his ancestry upon one side was Eng-
lish, upon the other Scotch and German. His paternal grandfather

was Samuel Baird, of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, a surveyor by profes-
sion, whose wife was Rebecca Potts.” The Bairds were from Scotland,
while the Potts family came from England to Pennsylvania at the close
of the seventeenth century. ‘‘ His great grandfather on the mother’s
side was the Rev. Elihu Spencer, of Trenton, one of the war preachers
of the Revolution, whose patriotic eloquence was so influential that a
price was set on his head by the British Government; his daughter
married William M. Biddle, a banker, of an English fama for many
generations established in Pennsylvania, and identified with the bank-
ing interests of Philadelphia. Samuel Baird, the father of the subject
of this sketch, established himself as a lawyer at Reading, Pennsylvania,
and died when his son was ten years old. He was a man of fine culture,
a strong thinker, a close observer, and a lover of nature and out-of-door
pursuits. His traits were inherited by his children, especially by his
sons Spencer and William. The latter, who was the elder, was the first
to begin collecting specimens, and as early as 1836 had in hand a col-
lection of the game-birds of Cumberland County. His brother soon
became his companion in this pursuit, and six years later they published
conjointly a paper entitled ‘ Descriptions of two species, supposed to be
new, of the Genus Tyrannula Swainson, found in Cumberland County,
Pennsylvania.” *

Barly in 1838 Professor Baird becaine acquainted with Audubon,
‘with whom he was for many years in correspondence, and who, in
1842, gave to him the greater part of his collection of birds, including
most of his types of new species.” In 1841 a very intimate friendship was
begun with George N. Lawrence, of New York, with John Cassin of
Philadelphia, in 1843, and Thomas M. Brewer, of Boston, in 1845. These

SPENCER F. BAIRD. 105:

Although his elder brother had anticipated him by a few years in be-
ginning the formation of a collection, he soon ‘“ diverged into other
paths,” and became a lawyer in Reading, Pennsylvania,* leaving to
him the field of ornithology, which he eathie vated so assiduously that
- when the catalogue of his collectiont was closed, at number 3696, al-
most every species of bird occurring, regularly or otherwise, in eastern
and central Pennsylvania was represented, and in most cases by series
of specimens showing the different stages and phases of plumage. This
collection, deposited there by Professor Baird when he entered upon his
duties as Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, is still in
the National Museum, of whose ornithological treasures it forms an im-
portant element, so many of its specimens having served as the types
of Professor Baird’s descriptions in his “ Birds of North America” and
subsequent works. In it are “specimens of birds prepared by these
boys forty-five [now nearly fifty] years ago by a simple process of
evisceration, followed by stuffing the body-cavities full of cotton and
arsenical soap”-—a method probably adopted by them before they had
learned the art of skinning birds.

Although his collection was made at a time when the art of taxider -v
is generally supposed to have been far behind its present status, espe-
cially so far as this country is concerned, the excellent preparation of
the specimens, their very precise labelling and perfect preservation,
show Professor Baird to have been in every respect the peer of any
ornithological collector of the present period. Exposed for more than
thirty years to constant handling and everything that could effect their
deterioration, they are still in a most excellent state of perservation,
and none have lost their labels. I have never known a specimen of
Professor Baird’s preparation to be attacked by insects, a statement
which I am able to make regarding few other collections of which I
possess the knowledge to speak. The force of these observations may
be better appreciated when it is considered that probably no other
collection of skins has ever received so much handling as that made by
Professor Baird, every standard work on North American birds pub-
lished since 1850 having been based essentially upon it, so far as eastern
species are concerned. Not only are the specimens prepared and pre-
served in a manner equalled by only the best of our living collectors,
but their labels are fastened with unusual security, and contain very
precise data, including scientific name (with authority), sex, age,
locality, and date; and usually, on the reverse side, the total length
and stretch of wings, measured before skinning.

The formation of so large and varied a collection of course in-

volved such a vast amount of field work as to remove Professor
Baird from the limbo of so-called ‘“ closet-naturalists.”. How pleasant
and instructive to him must have been his out-of-door studies of birds
may be inferred from the extent of his excursions, which are thus de-
scribed by Mr. Goode:

‘¢In 1841, at the age of eighteen, we find him making an ornithologi-
eal excursion through the mountains of Pennsylvania, walking four
hundred miles in twenty-one days, the last day sixty miles between day-
light and rest.* The following year he walked more than 2,200 miles.
His fine physique and consequent capacity for work are doubtless due
in part to his outdoor life during these years.”

Considering Professor Baird’s great interest in the study of birds, the
number of his ornithological publications is astonishingly small, amount-
ing to only seventy-nine different titles (see Mr. Goode’s Bibliography,
pp. 250-253). It is, therefore, strikingly evident that his publications
must have possessed unusual merit to earn for him so great a reputation
as anornithologist. This reputation was indeed established by the first
of his separate works, usually known and quoted as ‘‘ The Birds of North
america,” though not published under this title until two years after its
publication by the Government as volume 1x of the “ Report of Explo-
rations and Surveys, to ascertain the most practicable and economical
route for a Railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean.”
With the publication, in 1858, of this great quarto volume of more than
one thousand pages, began what my distinguished colleague, Professor
Coues, has fitly termed the “ Bairdian Period” of American ornithology—
a period covering almost thirty years and characterized by an activity
of ornithological research and rapidity of advancement without a parallel
in the history of the science. Referring to this great work, in his “ Bib-
liographical Appendix” to “ Birds of the Colorado Valley” (page 650),
Professor Couessays: ‘Itrepresents the mostimportant single step ever
taken in the progress of American ornithology in all that relates to the
technicalities. The nomenclature is entirely re-modelled from that of the
immediately preceding Audubonian period, and for the first time brought
abreast of the then existing aspect of the case. - - - The synon-
ymy of the work is more extensive and elaborate and more reliable
than any before presented; thecompilation was almost entirely original,
very few citations having been made at second-hand, and these being
indicated by quotation marks. The general text consists of diagnoses
or descriptions of each species, with extended and elaborate criticisms,
comparisons, and commentary. - - - The appearance of so great a
work, from the hands of a most methodical, learned, and sagacious
rear aided by two of the leading ornithologists of America (John
Cassin and George N. Lawrence), exerted an influence perhaps stronger
and more widely felt than that of any of its predecessors, Audubon’s

and Wilson’s not excepted, and marked an epoch in the history of
American ornithology. Thesynonymy and specific characters, original
in this work, have been used again and again by subsequent writers,
with various modifications and abridgment, and are in fact a large basis
of the technical portion of the subsequent ‘ History of North American
Birds,’ by Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway. Such a monument of original
research is likely to remain for an indefinite period a source of inspira-
tion to lesser writers, while its authority as a work of reference will
always endure.”

Thus are graphically described the distinctive features of what Mr.
Leonhard Stejneger has truthfully termed the Bairdian School* of
ornithology, a school strikingly characterized by peculiar exactness in
dealing with facts, conciseness in expressing deductions, and careful
analysis of the subject in its various bearings ;—methods so radically
different from those of the older ‘* Kuropean School” that, as the
esteemed member whom we have just named has already remarked,t
conclusions or arguments can be traced back to their source and thus
properly weighed, whereas the latter affords no basis for analysis. In
other words, as Mr. Stejneger has, in substance, said, the European
School requires the investigator to accept an author’s statements and
conclusions on his personal responsibility alone, while the Bairdian
furnishes him with tangible facts from which to take his deductions.

The dominant sources of Professor Baird’s training in systematic or-
nithology are not difficult to trace ; in fact, the bases of his classifications
are so fully explained or frequently mentioned in his various works as to
leave nothing to mere inference. He studied carefully the more ad-
vanced systems of his time, and with unerring instinct selected from
them their best features, and combined them, together with original ideas,
jnto a classification which was an improvement on its predecessors.
Thus, the classification presented in the ‘Birds of North America”
(1858) is based essentially upon the systems of Sundevall (“‘ Ornitholo-
giskt System,” 1835 and 1843), Cabanis (“Ornithologische Notizen,”
1847), and Keyserling and Blasius (‘‘ Wirbelthiere Europas,” 1340).
The nomenclature was fixed by methods adopted from G. R. Gray
(“List of the Genera of Birds,” etc., 184142), to the abandonment of
which must be attributed most of the subsequent changes in generic
names. In the “ Review” (186466) and “ History of North American
Birds” (1874), a further concession is made to the classifications of Sun-
devall and Cabanis by commencing with the Order Passeres and Fam-
ily Turdide instead of the Raptores. The same systems were the
foundation of Liljeborg’s “Classification of Birds,” formally adopted by
the Smithsonian Institution (through Professor Baird) in 1866, by
Messrs. Sclater and Salvin (with certain emendations and amplifica-

tions) in 1873, and with still further modifications by the American
Ornithologists’ Union, in 1886.

The distinctive features of the “ Bairdian School” were still further
developed by the publication, in 1864—66, of the “ Review of American
Birds,” a work of unequalled merit, displaying in their perfection Pro-
fessor Baird’s wonderful powers of analysis and synthesis, so strongly
combined in his treatment of difficult problems. Unfortunately for
ornithology this work was but fairly begun, only a single volume (an
octavo of 450 pages) being published. The cause of its discontinuance
is not definitely known to the present writer, but it may have been the
intervention of the “ Ornithology of California,” * a work based on the
manuscript notes of Dr. J. G. Cooper, but edited by Professor Baird,
who also superintended its publication, and the “ History of North
American Birds,” t material for which was already being arranged, be-
sides other literary work and the increasing pressure of administrative
duties. Whatever the cause, however, its discontinuance is to be
revretted, since its completion would have given us an invaluable guide
to the study of Neotropical birds. I have it on good authority
that no single work on American ornithology has made so profound an
impression on European ornithologists as Professor Baird’s ‘ keview ;”
and, by the same authority, lam permitted to state that he—a European
by birth and rearing—became an American citizen through its influence.

In the preface to the present writer’s latest work on American
ornithology{ the author is proud to mention that the book was “ orgi-
nally projected by Professor Spencer F. Baird, - - - whose works
represent the highest type of systematic ornithology and have furnished
the model from which the younger generation of ornithologists have
drawn their inspiration ;” and that his friendly advice and suggestions
had rendered comparatively easy the performance of a task which under
less favorable auspices would have been far more difficult of accomplish-
ment—acknowledgments which but faintly express the author’s obliga-
tion to his tutor.

The history of this work, briefly stated, is as follows:

Professor Baird had under way a smaller but very useful work, consisting of the ana-
SPENCER F. BAIRD. 709

In commenting upon the value of Professor Baird’s contributions to
scientific literature, Professor Goode remarks that “no one not living in
the present can form an accurate idea of the personal influence of aleader
upon his associates and upon the progress of thought in his special de-
partment, nor can such an influence as this well be set down in words.
This influence is apparently due not only to extraordinary skill in organ-
ization, to great power of application and concentration of thought con-
stantly applied, and to a philosophical and comprehensive mind, but to
an entire and self-sacrificing devotion to the interests of his own work
and that of others.”

But it is not only through his published works and personal influence
with his associates and pupils that Professor Baird was powerful in
the development and advancement of ornithology in America. His
position as head of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Mu-
seum gave him peculiar opportunities for putting into practical shape
his plans for a thorough exploration of little known portions of the
continent. “To his influence with the Government authorities is due
theexcellent field-work done in connection with nearly all the Government
surveys and the Signal Service Bureau, from the first inception of the va-
rious Pacific Railroad surveys to the present time.” * If the exploration of
a particular field suggested itself to him, he rarely failed to find, sooner
or later, means to accomplish the object in view; no opportunity for
making use of, or securing the co-operation of, other departments of the
Government in maintaining explorations which he had himself insti-
gated or organized was ever neglected, and for such opportunities he
wasconstantiy alert. His success in thus promoting the cause of science
was, however, by no means wholly due to the importance of his official
positions, his personal zeal and influence often accomplishing what
might not otherwise have been successful.

The sterling qualities of mind and heart which were so conspicuous
in Professor Baird’s character were as well known and as highly appre-
ciated abroad as at home. As an illustration of this fact, I quote the

lytical or synoptical tables of the larger work, improved and somewhat enlarged by
the introduction of brief diagnoses of the nests and eggs of the different species,
together with the English names. This book, of which there exists only a single
copy, and that not perfect, was completed early in 1874. Its title is ‘‘ Outlines of
American Ornithology, by S. F. Baird and R. Ridgway. Part I, Land Birds.” Fer,
some reason the work was never published, and the electrotype plates were destroyed.’
This work, in which the present writer had some share, was the embryo which, after
twelve years’ incubation, finally developed into the more comprehensive ‘‘ Manual
of North American Birds,” in the preparation of which, however, Professor Baird
took no active part, though it is scarcely necessary to say that he was much in-
terested in its progress, even almost to the close of his life, which ended shortly after
the work had been printed, but before it could be published. It has been a matter
of deep regret to the author that Professor Baird could not have had a share in the
preparation of the book, and still more that he could not have lived to enjoy the
satisfaction of seeing it published.

following obituary notice in “Nature” for August 25, by Mr. R. Bowdler
Sharpe, senior assistant, Department of Zoology, in the British Museum,
well known as an ornithologist of eminence:

“By Englishmen who knew Professor Baird personally, the loss must
be especially felt, but there are many who never had met him in the
flesh, to whom the news of his decease must come as that of a dear
friend. As one of the latter class we venture to express our sympathy
with our scieptific brethren in America on the decease of one ef their
most eminent and respected colleagues. As chief of the Smithsonian
Institution, Professor Baird possessed a power of conferring benefits on
the world of science exercised by few directors of public museums, and
the manner in which he utilized these powers has resulted not only in
the wonderful success of the United States National Museum under
his direction, but in the enrichment of many other museums which
were in friendly intercourse with the Smithsonian Institution. We
know by experience that the British Museum is indebted beyond meas-
ure to Professor Baird, and we need only to refer to the recent volumes
of the ‘Catalogue of Birds’ to show how much our National Museum
owes to the sister museum in America for hearty co-operation. We had
only to write and express our wants, and immediately every effort was
made, by Professor Baird’s instructions, to supply all the desiderata in
our ornithological collection, and this without the slightest demand for
an equivalent exchange, though, of course, in the case of the British
Museum every effort was made to reciprocate the good feeling shown
by the great American museum. There must be many private collect-
ors in this country who will endorse our acknowledgments to Professor
Baird for the unrivalled liberality which he has always shown in the
advancement of the studies of every ornithologist who invoked his aid.
- - - We may add that during an experience of twenty years we
have never heard from any ornithologist, European or American, a
single unkind word concerning Professor Baird, either in his public or
private capacity. This is something to say in this age of jealousies and
backbitings.”

Indeed, it may with truth be said that so widespread, so nearly uni-
versal has been his influence that few there are, if any, among his
contemporaries who have not had occasion to record their sense of obli-
gation for his aid, his counsel, or his noble example. We all delight
to acknowledge him our great teacher, and in doing so do honor to
ourselves. ji

A very marked trait of Professor Baird’s character was his aversion
to personal controversy, which was so decided that under no circum-
stances could he be drawn into one. It was his invariable rule to
answer his critics by a dignified silence, no matter how great the provo-
cation to reply, or how strong a case his side presented ; and in every
instance known to the writer it has transpired that the ground taken or
the statements made by Professor Baird have stood the test of time.
‘One of his striking characteristics was that he would never quarrel
SPENCER F. BAIRD. (al

and never have apything to do with the quarrels of others. He was
always for peace.” *

As a public officer, no man was more conscientiously devoted to his
duty or faithful in its performance; and he administered the compli-
cated affairs of three distinct and important establishments with an
ability which commanded admiration, although it was plainly to be
seen that the responsibilities were too great for any single person to
bear. His capacity for work was enormous, and he was constantly oe-
cupied. He enjoyed work, and it was not his industry which hurt him;
but the harassing cares of his public trusts and the weight of their re-
sponsibility were too much for even his powerful physique to endure,
and he gave way under the strain.

No man was more easily approached than Professor Baird, or greeted
a new acquaintance more cordially. His reception of young persons--
especially those with an inclination for natural history, was particularly
charming, at once relieving them from embarrassment and captivating
them by his unassuming manners, his geniality, and frankness.

Trusting that he does not introduce too prominently his own person-
ality into this memoir, the writer offers the following brief outline of
his personal acquaintance with Professor Baird, as being of probable
interest to members of the Union, and as giving an insight into the
character of his lamented friend.

Until near the middle of the year 1864, the writer, then a lad in his
fourteenth year, was unacquainted with the name of any living natu-
ralist, or with any books on natural history except such general or
superficial compilations as Goldsmith’s ‘Animated Nature,’ a history
of the United States (author forgotten) which included a chapter or
two on the natural history, and Goodrich’s ‘Animal Kingdom’—works
which, although supplying much vaiuable information to the general
reader, were of course wholly inadequate to the wants of a special
student. A lady resident in the town learned of his difficulties, and
suggested that by writing to the Commissioner of Patents in Washing-
ton he might be able to obtain the correct names of birds, supplement-
ing her fortunate suggestion by the gift.of an envelope bearing the
printed address of a former Commissioner of Patents. <A letter was
written, and with it was inclosed a colored drawing, life size, of a pair
of Purple Finches (‘*Roseate Grosbeak, Loxia rosea,” of the incipient
ornithologist) perched upon a dry stalk of the great ragweed (Ambrosia
trifida), the seeds of which in winter constitute the principal food of
the bird in that locality. An answer was awaited with great impa-
tience, but in due time was received, the following being an exact copy :
*« No. 5664. | “ SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

not Mr. Bishop) has sent me your letter, as more conversant with the

interest and much pleasure, as showing an unusual degree of ability
as an artist, and of intelligent attention to a scientific subject. 1 had
no difficulty in recognizing the bird you sent, and was much pleased to
see that you had given all the essential features of form and color with
much accuracy.

“The bird is the Purple Finch (Carpodacus purpureus). I send you a
catalogue of the birds of North America and some other pamphlets.*
If you can procure the ninth volume of the Pacific Nailroad Reports,
you will find descriptions of all the North American birds, by myself.

‘‘T will be glad to hear from you and to render you any aid by nam-
ing your drawings, or in any other way. You must learn the scientific
names of the birds, and thus be able to talk and write about them
with persons not knowing the English names used in your part of the
country.

“ Let me know what kind of eggs you have.

‘Very truly yours,
“SPENCER F. BAIRD.
‘Assistant Secretary Smithsonian Institution.
“ ROBERT RIDGWAY,
Mt. Carmel, Illinois.

The above letter was a revelation to the recipient, who, in his isola-
tion, was ignorant of the existence of any one but himself engaged in
the study of birds. He had read of Audubon and Wilson, and Nut-
tall, and Bonaparte, but these he knew were all dead. The profound
impression produced by the letter and the hope that it gave, may be
imagined. From this commencement arose a correspondence which to
the present writer was a constant source of delight and instruction,
and to which he looks back with feelings that cannot be expressed. It
was not until the early part of 1867, nearly three years later, that the
writer obtained a copy of the text of “ Birds cf North America” (vol-
ume IX, Pacific Railroad Report), and it therefore became necessary
for him to continue the sending of drawings and descriptions in order
to obtain the much-desired identifications. In replying to the writer’s
numerous letters of this character, Professor Baird always wrote most
kindly and encouragingly, replying to multitudinous queries as fuily as
the arduous duties of his official position would allow. To mention all
the useful hints which he gave would require to much space here, but
the following are selected as samples:

‘“T would advise you to spend most of your leisure time in practising
drawing of birds and nammals from nature and from life, so as to ae-
quire a facility in seizing a temporary attitude and transferring it to
paper. Make these sketches continually whenever you have the op-
portunity, so as to secure the more practice. A certain number of
these drawings you may work up in their minutest details, and it will
be a good exercise to draw the feathers of a single wing, as well as bill,
feet, etc., and skulls of mammals. The object should be in drawing

mens of natural history, published by the Smithsonian Institution, and well known
to naturalists in this country.

form to secure artistic elegance and at the same time a minute, almost
microscopic, accuracy in matters of detail, as far as they can be repre-
sented.

‘“‘ The drawings you have sent are too fragmentary to show what your
present abilities as an artist are, and I would rather see some full-sized

‘Tt will not be necessary to spend much time in practising coloring,
as this is rather a mechanical work, easily acquired by practice. The
first object should be to obtain the highest perfection in drawing the
form and in filling out minute details.” (From a letter dated Decem-
ber 24, 1865.)

In a letter dated January 13, 1867, he gave this valuable advice as to
writing field-notes: ‘* Let me give you one hint in regard to making notes
on the specimens. Never write on both sides of the same leaf. In this
way it will be possible to cut apart your notes into slips and assort
with others of same purport, so as to re-arrange systematically. Do this
for your own notes as well as those you send me: You will often
realize the advantage of so doing.”

It is unnecessary here to go into details concerning events subse-
quent to the beginning of this correspondence. Suffice it to say that
in all his relations with Professor Baird the writer remembers, with
deepest gratitude and reverence, his uniform great kindness of heart,
his genial manners, his wise counsels, and his steadfast friendship ;
and, with others who were so fortunate as to have enjoyed the privi-
lege of his acquaintance, he mourns a departed friend and teacher,
whose loss is irreparable.

PROCEEDINGS AT A MEETING COMMEMORATIVE OF THE LIFE AND
SCIENTIFIC WORK

OF
SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD,

Held January 11, 1888, under the joint auspices of the Anthropological, Biological, and
Philosophical Societies of Washington.

INTRODUCTION.

On August 19, 1887, Spencer Fullerton Baird, Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, Director of the U. 8S. National Museum, and U.S.
Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, died at Wood’s Holl, Massachu-
setts, his post of duty in the last-named office. His death at once ex-
cited throughout the world feelings and expressions of profound regret.
At that time nearly allof his Washington associates in scientific pursuits
were absent from the city, on field duty or in vacation, and were thus
unable to jointly testify to the affection and respect in which he was
held by them.

And especially the scientific societies of Washington, none of which
meet during the summer months, were unable to immediately take any
action in the matter or to give organized expression to the sentiments
of their members.

With the resumption of meetings, however, it was determined that
such expression should be given with all ceremonial completeness, and
as the senior of the Washington scientific societies, and the one with
which Professor Baird had been most closely connected, the Philosoph-
ical Society took the initial steps in arranging a joint meeting with the
Anthropological and Biological Societies, a meeting which might enable
the members and their friends to testify not only their profound respect
for this foremost scientific leader, but also their affectionate regard for
the man.

The appended invitation and programme, which was mailed to all
members of the Philosophical, Anthropological, Biological, and Chem-
ical Societies, and of the Cosmos Club, sets forth the form taken in
those arrangements.

WASHINGTON, January 4, 1883.

Str: The Philosophical Society in conjunction with the other scien-
tific societies of the city will hold a meeting on Wednesday evening,
January the eleventh, in commemoration of the life and services to

science of the late SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD, Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, Director of the National Museum, and United
States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.

Members of the societies, and ladies and gentlemen whom they may
desire to invite, will assemble in the lecture-room of the Columbian Uni-
versity, on the southeast corner of Hand Fifteenth streets, at a quarter
past eight o’clock.

RELATIONS BETWEEN PROFESSOR BAIRD AND PARTICI-
PATING SOCIETIES.

By Mr. GARRICK MALLERY, President of the Philosophical Society.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: During several winters before 1871, a
club, with commingled social and scientific purposes, used to meet in
this city at the houses of its members. <A single paper on some scien-
tific subject was read, usually by the host of the evening, following
which was a discussion. Supper was always provided. The title of
the club only related to the night of meeting, Saturday, and the or-
ganization was so loose that several of the survivors among the regu-
lar participants at the meetings do not now remember whether they
were actual members, or indeed that there was a definite membership.
As the city of Washington emerged from the condition of a Southern
village, and the benign policy of the Government increased the num-
ber and force of the scientific institutions at the capital, the need of
an organization which should bring scientific men together on an equal
footing and give more time to papers and their discussion became man-
ifest. To meet this want the attendants of the Saturday-Night Club,
on March 13, 1871, formed the Philosophical Society of Washington,
its object, in the words of the call, being “the free exchange of views
on scientific subjects and the promotion of scientific inquiry among
its members.” :

The term ‘“ philosophical,” as the first president of the society,
Joseph Henry, stated in his first address, was chosen after consider-
able deliberation, ‘‘ not to denote, as it generally does in the present
day, the unbounded field of speculative thought, which embraces the
possible as well as the actual of existence, but to be used in its re-
stricted sense to indicate those branches of knowledge that relate to
the positive facts and laws of the physical and moral universe.”

Of the forty-three gentiemen who signed the call twenty-one are now
dead. Professor Baird was prominent among the founders, and served
continuously as a member of the general committee from the organi-
zation to November 10, 1877; and from that date until his death, on
August 19 last, he was a member of the committee on publications.

The first communication of a scientific paper to the Society was made
by him on March 18, 1871, The most important and extended original

papers communicated by him were “On the decrease of fish on the
southern coast of New England,” presented March 23, 1872, and “On
the artificial propagation of the cod, describing the measures and proc-
ess adopted at Gloucester, Massachusetts, and the success thus far
obtained,” presented March 1, 1879.

The last-mentioned occasion is memorable to me, and some account
of it will be interesting to the younger members of the Society, few of
whom ever heard Professor Baird’s voice raised in its hall. I happened
to join him on his way to the meeting, and during the walk he spoke
of the struggle at that moment between the sense of duty requiring
him to take his part in the proceedings of the Society and his repug-
nance to making any formal address. This modesty—indeed timidity
—in an eminent writer and thinker, whose lightest words were sure of
eager attention in a society composed mainly of his personal friends
and wholly of his admirers, was the more remarkable because his ad-
dress, presented a few minutes later, was most pleasing in its delivery
as well as instructive in its substance. He spoke without notes, and,
though his style was conversational and in no degree oratorical, his
appropriate words in their rapid flow expressed his thoughts clearly,
completely, and in orderly sequence.

During the same walk, Professor Baird mentioned with earnest com-
mendation the usage of the Society by which the perfect equality of
members is recognized through the omission of all official and profes-
sional titles. This was not a merely unwritten custom but was founded
on a binding resolution, appearing in the minates of June 6,1874. The
Society is probably the only non-esoteric body in the United States
in which the titles of judge and general, professor and doctor, gov-
ernor, senator, and even honorable member are forbidden; the simple
and dignified Mr., the modern form of magister, being the only address
allowed. Perhaps the plethoraof titles and the burdensome hierarchical
gradations in Washington compelled this measure of relief.

The Anthropological Society was founded February 17, 1879, its
defined object being “to encourage the study of the natural history of
man, especially with reference to America.” Professor Baird warmly
approved of the organization of this society, took constant interest in
it, and, at the time of his death, was the only honorary member resid-
ing in the United States on its rolls.

The Biological Society was organized December 3, 1880, “to encourage
the study of the biological sciences,” and Professor Baird was the only
honorary member ever elected by it. He did not take an active part
in the proceedings of either of the last-mentioned societies but gave
them material assistance. Both of them met at first in the Regents’
room of the Smithsonian Institution, placed by him at their disposal,
and he provided for the stereotyping and circulation of their volumes
of transactions, a benefaction which the Philosophical Society had
earlier enjoyed.
SPENCER F, BAIRD. 719

President Henry, in his address before mentioned, stated that in no
other city in the United States was there, in proportion to the number
of its inhabitants, so many men actively engaged in pursuits connected
with science as in Washington. In the seven following years the num-
ber of persons in the city engaged in scientific work was nearly doubled,
and most of them joined the Philosophical Society, so that in the year
1878 it had become recognized as the most efficient scientific body on
this continent with a membership confined to a single locality. The
criteria of this superiority were not only the large membership and reg-
ular attendance of members, but the number, quality, and variety of the
papers presented and discussed. This abundance, and, as was proved
by the later successful establishment of differentiated societies as an
overflow, this superabundance of scientific papers occupied every mo-
ment of the meetings, so that the members as such had no opportunity
to become acquainted with one another or to interchange views, except
in the formal discussions following the papers announced in the printed
programs. There was no provision for social introduction or intercourse.
This appreciated want, the converse of the inadequacy of the Saturday-
Night Club, resulted in the foundation of the Cosmos Club on Decem-
ber 13, 1878, in the organization of which all the members of the Philo-
sophical society were invited to join. It is needless to descant upon
the unique character of the Cosmos Club in its membership and objects,
its vital connection with science, literature, and art, and its immediate
but enduring success. The remark, however, is pertinent that in the
winter of 1878 an uuprecedented agitation, excited by impending na-
tional legislation, perturbed the scientific circles of the Capital, during
which the proposition to form the club was attacked with virulence as
a scheme in the selfish interest of a few individuals, and one fraught
with machiavelian political designs ; but when Professor Baird mani-
fested his approval of the plan by accepting the first presidency of the
club after its formal organization, confidence in him was so dominant
that suspicion was allayed and opposition disappeared. To him pro-
found thanks are due for the timely establishment of the most impor-
tant institution in the conjoint social and scientific life at Washington.

But by his work in the organization of these several societies and of
the Cosmos Club Professor Baird was, as in his other fields of labor, a
benefactor and not a participant in the benefits secured to others. He
was imbued with the cardinal principle of the Smithsonian [nstitution
not only to establish and assist all useful agencies for the promotion of
the well-being of man, but afterwards, when they had attained to sue-
cessful operation, to leave them to themselves and explore new fields
of beneficence. It was also his own character, apart from any formu-
lated maxim of the Institution, that he could not rest in the personal
720 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

enjoyment of accomplished results. He wasone of the ceaseless work-
ers, born
“To scorn delights, and live laborious days,”
until
‘Gomes the blind Fury with th’ abhorred shears
And slits the thin-spun life. But not the praise!”

It is for us now, repressing sorrow. to join in tributes of praise to our
benefactor.
PROFESSOR BAIRD AS ADMINISTRATOR.

o

By Mr. Wn. B. Taytor, of the Smithsonian Institution.

We are met this evening to express in a memorial service our respect
‘for an honored fellow-member of our several societies, lately deceased,
and to indulge as well in an interchange of affectionate reminiscence of
a departed friend.

Spencer Fullerton Baird was born at Reading, Pennsylvania, Febru-
ary 3, 1823. He was graduated at Dickinson College, in Carlisle, Penn-
sylvania, in 1840, at the age of seventeen, and with an original fond-
ness for natural history and the study of the out-door world. he spent
several years in his favorite pursuits and in collecting animal speci-
mens for preservation. In 1845, at the youthful age of twenty-two, he
was elected Professor of Natural History in his alma mater—Dickinson
College.

Three years later, in 1848, while still pursuing with ardor the study
of nature, he applied for and obtained from the Smithsonian Institution
(then recently established) its first modest grant for the promotion of
original research. This was tu be applied to the exploration of bone
caves, and to the development of the local natural history of south-
eastern Pennsylvania. The transaction appears to have been the oc-
casion of first bringing the young professor to the favorable notice of
the Smithsonian Director, Professor Henry, and of initiating between
the two a mutual respect and friendship that continued throughout
their several lives.

The early history of the Smithsonian Institution was signalized by a
long struggle—both in the Board of its Regents and in the halls of Con-
gress, between the votaries of literature, and those of science, for the
disposal of the Smithson fund. During this period, in 1850, when it
was seen that the income of this institution was not to be absorbed in
the building up of a great national library, Professor Henry asked of
the Regents authority to appoint an Assistant Secretary in the depart-
ment of natural history to take charge of the Museum, and to aid in the
publication and other interests of the establishment. A resolution
authorizing such an appointment being adopted, Henry selected Pro-
fessor Baird, of Dickinson College, as the one well fitted for the place,

H, Mis, 142—-—46 721
122 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

The appointment was unanimously confirmed by the Board July 5,
1850, and Professor Baird being notified, at once accepted and entered
upon his aew duties. He deposited in the Museum his own valuable
collections, comprising an extensive series of the skins of various
mammals (European as wellas American), a iarge number of bird skins
(unmounted), representing about five hundred American species and
half as many European species, a rich variety of birds’ nests and birds’
eggs, more than five hundred glass jars, tin vessels, and kegs contain-
ing alcoholic specimens of reptiles and fishes, and a number of verte-
brate skeletons and of fossil remains.

The new Assistant Secretary was truly in his element, and showed
himself pre-eminently “ the right man in the right place.” In Henry’s
Fourth Annual Report (that for 1850), after recording the appointment
of his Assistant, he adds: ** He entered on his duties in July last and,
besides being actively engaged in organizing the department of natural
history, he has rendered important service in conducting our foreign
exchanges and attending to the business of the press.”

The Smithsonian system of exchanges was instituted for the purpose
of facilitating the reciprocal transmission between the Old World and
the New of the memoirs of learned socities, and this system has become
an essential agency in the interchange and diffusion of knowledge, and
in the more rapid advancement of scientific discovery, by a wider and
prompter co-operation. Previous to this inauguration such distant
scientific information was so rarely and inconveniently accessible
largely through the delays and harassmeuts of customs exactions, that
important principles had not unfrequently been re-discovered abroad
or at home, and sometimes with a considerable interval of time, to
subsequently disturb and dispute a coveted and settled priority.

By theurgent zeal of the Smithsonian Director, representing to foreign
powers that only gratuitous distribution of the literary and scientific
memoirs of societies or of individuals (not usually found on sale) was un-
dertaken by the Institution, and that no commercial enterprise calcu-
lated in any way to interfere with the legitimate operations of trade was
attempted, one port after another was opened to its packages, until in
the course of a few years, the announcement was made that the Smith-
sonian exchanges were allowed to pass through every custom-house on
earth, unopened and unquestioned.

Creditabile as this special liberality is, it has not yet, unfortunately,
been applied to the customary channels of book lore, and the quest for
knowledge is still held by a majority of civilized nations as an indulgence
very proper to be taxed. Our own legislators have also made our higher
education a source of revenue; possibly with a view to the “incidental
protection” of American science by the heavy tariff laid on the foreign
and imported article.

The advantage to the cause of science from this Smithsonian system
of international exchange of intellectual products, free of duty, and with
SPENCER F. BAIRD. TZ

the freight expenses assumed by the Institution, can scarcely be too
highly appreciated. In the early promotion of this beneficent scheme,
Professor Baird became an energetic agent and sympathetic coadjutor
of the Smithsonian Secretary. The remarkable development of thisserv-
ice may be sufficiently indicated by a glance at the amount of material
transmitted through this Institution, on each tenth year for thirty years,
showing something like a geometrical ratio of increase. The total weight
of vooks, pamphlets, and charts distributed in 1855 was about 6 tons; in
1865, about 9 tons; in 1875, about 20 tons; and in 1885, about 85 tons.
With the rapid growth of the exchange operations, the active and com-
prehensive faculties of Professor Baird seemed but to find a better field
of exercise.

At the same time, the accumulating collections of the Museum—in-
creased in 1858 by the transfer from the Patent Office to the Smithson-
ian Building of the interesting contributions from the earlier national
exploring expeditions—demanded a large share of attention for their
proper arrangement, exposition, and superintendence.* To say that
this important work of organization was zealously and judiciously car-
ried out, is to characterize but imperfectly the directive skill and energy
of the Museum curator.

Of Professor Baird’s work in original biologic research, of his contri-
butions to various scientific journals and society proceedings, of his
English translation of the popular * lconographic Encyclopedia,” of his
editorship of the “ Annual Record of Science and Industry” for eight
years, and of his other publications, it is not proposed here to speak.
This aspect of his intellectual life will be discussed by one in every re-
spect far more competent to a just and discriminating presentation of
the theme. The present remarks will be confined to a cursory review of
Professor Baird’s varied administrative work.

For a number of years a notable decline in the productiveness of our
extended fisheries had been with anxiety observed; the annual yield of
this important element of our food supply having in many cases fallen
oft one-half of its amount a quarter of a century earlier. So serious a
diminution and consequent enhancement of cost of subsistence was be-
coming a menacing problem. Were our leading food fishes undergoing
a process of slow but certain extinction? Several of the States (espe-
cially those of New England) appointed commissions of inquiry into the
causes and remedies of the threatening evil but with little result.

In the stern competitive struggle that from the dawn of terrestrial
paleontogeny has been ordained by nature as the feudal tenure of all
existence, and from which service man himself is not exempted, the
feebleness of early youth in the individuals of every race would speedily

*This accession of the Government deposit of ethnological and natural history spec-
imens was estimated by Professor Baird, in his report for 1858, as comprising not more
than a fourth of the material already in the Smithsonian Museum or a fifth of the ag-
gregate amount,

terminate the biology of our planet were not provisions made for bridg-
ing over these cross lines of weakness to preserve the continuity of
species. In the lower classes of being we find the crude expedient of a
fertility so enormous as to allow of the wholesale destruction of the un-
protected eggs or of their brood, and yet leave a remnant to spare for
the chances ofreaching adult age. In numerous other classes a mar-
velous sagacity is displayed by the mother in depositing her eggs where
they will be least exposed to accident or voracious attack, and where
the progeny (that she shall never see) will meet with their appropriate
sustenance. In insects this peculiar instinct—so difficult of explanation
as ‘inherited experience ”—is perhaps most strikingly displayed. And
lastly, when we ascend to the higher classes of birds and mammals we
find the parental sentiment developed to an untiring vigilance for the
protection, and provident care for the nutrition, of the new generation
until itis able to take up for itself the battle of life.

As an illustration of the reckless prodigality of productiveness in
some of the lower families of the vertebrate branch it may be recalled
that a single salmon will lay five thousand eggs; a trout, fifteen thou-
sand eggs; a perch, a herring, or a shad, thirty thousand eggs; a
pike, one hundred thousand eggs; a carp, four hundred thousand
eges; a mackerel five hundred thousand eggs; a flounder, one million
eggs; a haddock, one million and a half of eggs; a halibut, two and a
half millions of eggs; a pollock, four million eggs; a codfish of medium
size, five million eggs; a large-sized cod, eight million eggs, and a tur-
bot, nine million eggs. Such numbers are simply astounding; they
can not be realized. And how great the marvel when we consider that
each of these nine million units is a potential fish, capable of develop-
inent into all the perfected attributes and functions of the parent form!
Among the lower invertebrates may be simply instanced the oyster—
capable of producing the incredible number of twenty or thirty million
eggs, and if of large size as many as forty or fifty million eggs.

If with this amazing fertility the various kinds of fish just named
are not rapidly increasing, but are stationary or even decreasing in
numbers, how overwhelming must be their early destruction. Even
after allowing for the many millions of adult fish taken by man, it is
obvious that of many species not one in a thousand or in ten thousand
of eggs or of the newly hatched can survive to maturity. Professor
Mobius estimates that for every grown oyster upon the beds of Schles-
wig-Holstein more than a million have died.

To avert, if possible, the menace of increasing scarcity of fish supply
the attention of Congress was directed to the subject; the more prop-
erly since in our National Government resided the jurisdiction over our
extended sea-coasts. By a joint resolution, approved February 9, 1571,
the President was authorized and required to appoint a person of
proved scientific and practical acquaintance with the fishes of the coast
to be Commissioner of Fishes and Fisheries, with the duty to prosecute
SPENCER F. BAIRD. (25

investigations into the causes of diminution, if any, in numbers of the
food-fishes of the coast and the lakes of the United States, and to re-
port whether any and what protective, prohibitory, or precautionary
measures should be adopted in the premises.

No man more suitable for this important and responsible position
than Professor Baird could have been selected. He was at once
appointed by President Grant and confirmed by the Senate as the
Commissioner. In his first report he announced, as the result of a
most careful and thorough examination, that the decrease of the shore
fishes of the New England waters during the preceding twenty years
was fully substantiated, and that it had been much more rapid since the
year 1865.

In furtherance of his great work the resources of the Smithsonian
Institution were freely placed at the disposal of the Commissioner,
and in the same report he gratefully acknowledges this hearty co-
operation by saying: ‘‘lam indebted to Professor Henry for permis-
sion to use the extensive collection of apparatus belonging to the
Smithsonian Institution in the way of nets, dredges, tanks, ete., and
thus saving the considerable outlay which would otherwise have been
necessary.”

The new studies into the life-history of the principal shore fishes,
into the character and range of their enemies, and into their appropri-
ate meavs of subsistence, requisite to an intelligent consideration of
the conditions most favorable to their propagation,—involved investi-
gations embracing the entire marine fauna of the coast, vertebrate and
invertebrate. These extensive and varied researches necessarily de-
manded the aid of skilled assistants,—of « corps of eminent specialists
in marine biology, and a corresponding division of labor.

The results of these investigations have been given to the world in
hundreds of memoirs, published in the reports and bulletins of the
Commission, and in the proceedings and bulletins of the National
Museum. And it is quite within bounds to say that in importance, in
variety, and in extent of original information thus communicated no
such quantity of contribution to our knowledge of zoology has ever
emanated from any other organization within the same interval of
time. Many species of fishes entirely new to science have been dis-
covered and carefully described, and the number of invertebrate forms
known to inhabit the waters explored has probably been fully doubled.

It-was shown, from the abundance of the lower forms of life, that the
decline of the useful fishes had not resulted from any lack of their ac-
customed food supply, nor had it resulted apparently from any less
favorable conditions of environment, nor from the prevalence of any
epidemic diseases. It was therefore a consequence of excess in their
destruction.

Among all the ravages of predaceons fishes it was found that the
“pluefish” was the most voracious and devastating pirate of the
726 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

coast. In the report it is stated: “ Sometimes among a school of
herring or menhaden, thousands of bluefish will be seen biting off
the tail of one and then another, destroying ten times aS many fish as
they really need for food, and leaving in their track the surface of the

water covered with the blood and fragments of the mangled fish.”
Fortunately this fish is itself valuable for food, and it is accordingly
taken in large numbers.*

But by far the most rapacious and destructive scourge of the waters
is man himself. By reckless extravagance in his methods of capture
he would soon consume the capital of his abundant patrimony, were no
restraints imposed upon the thoughtless improvidence of his greed.
With the growth of population and demand, and the improved facilities
for rapid transportation, the stimulus to inventive ingenuity occasioned
the establishing of fish-traps and fish-pounds on a large scale that gath-
ered thousands in their confines, with little regard to the probable sup-
ply of the future. As these traps and pounds were placed directly in
the way of the fish to their spawning-beds, it resulted that a very large
proportion of spawn fishes were taken by them, thus greatly reducing
the prospects of the succeeding generation.

Whatever protective measures might be deemed expedient to check
this spendthrift waste, it was seen that the most immediate and prom-
ising work of the Commissioner would be to promote the rapid multi-
plication of fish; and to this dominant interest the annual appro-
priations by Congress have been more and more largely directed.

Pisciculture is by no means a recent art, it having been extensively
practiced by the Chinese for a number of centuries: and even the arti-
ficial fecundation of fish-spawn is nearly a century and a third old,
having been apparently first introduced by Jacobi, a German, of West-
phalia. Most of the European nations had already given attention to
the practical application of fish-culture, and in different parts of our
own country enterprising individuals had undertaken the operation
with gratifying results.

Under the organizing direction of Professor Baird a careful study
was made of existing methods, extended experiments on artificial propa-
gation were conducted, and successive improvements in the various
stages of incubation, hatching, and development introduced—each de-
tail receiving a scientific treatment—until a scale of success has been
effected far more complete and satisfactory than ever before attained.
While under natural conditions but a small proportion of the spawn
deposited is hatched (the greater mass being eagerly devoured by
various aquatic tribes), and of the portion hatched but a small per-
centage escapes to reach maturity, under the careful breeding of art
fully ninety per cent. of all the eggs secured are fertilized and success-
fully developed.

*Tn his first report, Professor Baird says: ‘‘1 am myself cognizant of the capture
of no less than 20,000 bluefish, representing a weight of at least 100,000 pounds, in one
weir in the course of a single night.”
SPENCER F. BAIRD. V (eg |

Of the practical results of this great national enterprise it is unnec-
essary to speak. A dozen varieties of our best food-fishes have been
disseminated throughout the inland waters and the sea-board of our
country in increasing quantities; Sransported in the form of the young
fry or in that of fertilized eggs to other hatching stations; and while
an accurate estimate is, perhaps, at present not easily attainable, it will
hardly be held an exaggeration to say that these productions are to be
numbered by thousands of millions. Of these, many millions (by a
most praiseworthy public courtesy) have been distributed to foreign
countries—to Australia, to Brazil, to Canada, to England, to France,
to Germany, to Mexico, to The Netherlands, to Scotland, and to Switz-
erland. ;

In the great International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin in 1880 our
national commission was authorized by Congress to participate. Pro-
fessor Baird appointed as his deputy to personally superintend this
movement Professor Goode, the present Fish Commissioner, under
whose energetic direction, in a remarkably short space of time, the
marvellous American exhibit was organized, transported, and installed,
to the wonder and admiration of every visitor. The head of the Amer-
ican Commission was hailed by the President of.the German Fisheries
Association as the “chief fish-culturist in the world,” and to him was
awarded for the most complete and imposing display of all the details
and accessories of his scientific art the unique first-honor prize of the
exhibition, the gift of the Emperor of Germany.

But time fails to permit more than a passing glance at other fields of
activity no less important in which Professor Baird employed his re-
markable powers of executive management. The Smithsonian Insti-
tution from its inception had given great encouragement to ex-
plorations, and its director had zealously labored to enlist, as far as
practicable, the various expeditions undertaken by the Government,
in the extension of scientific research. These efforts were liber-
ally responded to by the Executive Departments, and trained ex-
perimentalists and observers were given every facility for physical,
physiographieal, and biological investigations at distant points. The
Institution thus became almost the Government superintendent of
scientific expeditions. In all that pertained to ethnology and natural
history Professor Baird became, of course, the leading spirit, and the
various circulars of direction and inquiry issued by him show with
what range and thoroughness he supervised this wide department,
while the resulting memoirs and valuable museum accessions attest as
their fruits the practical wisdom of the measures and methods adopted.

Congress having made provision for the representation by the Gov-
ernment in the National Centennial Exhibition to be held at Phila-
delphia, the President of the United States requested the Executive
Departments, together with the Smithsonian Institution, to co-operate.
in a collection illustrative of our progress and resources. In his report
728 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

of 1875, Professor Baird formulated (as requested by Professor Henry) -
his plans for the different details of the projected exhibit, and these
being adopted were carried out to a result that made the Smithsonian
display the leading attraction of the extensive Government building.

At the death of Professor Henry, in 1878, his faithful assistant and
coadjutor was elected by the Regents as his successor, and his long
familiarity with the different lines of active operations pursued by the
Institution, made him from the start an efficient director. Another
grave responsibility was thus thrown entirely upon his shoulders, and
he proved himself equal to the occasion.

In 1879, Congress made an appropriation (since continued annually)
for the prosecution of North American ethnology, to be expended under
the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. For the administration
of this important trust, Professor Baird selected one whom he knew to
be peculiarly fitted by training, by zeal, and by congenial tastes, to
pursue successfully the anthropologic study of our waning aborigines,
and the new Bureau of Ethnology was judiciously committed to the
control of the distinguished Director of the Geological Survey, Major
Powell.

In the same year (that following Henry’s death) an appropriation
(for many years importunately besought of Congress) was made for
the erection of a national museum building. In 1882 the completion of
this building rendered necessary the re-organization of the Museum,
with a staff of expert curators, on a scale commensurate with its im-
portance and the abundance of its previously stored material.

Professor Baird had now become the manager of three great estab-
lishments ;—the Fisheries Commission, the Smithsonian Institution, and
the National Museum; either one of which was a charge sufficient to
fully task the energies of a vigorous man. No wonder, with the strain
of unremitted though divided attention to these exacting duties, that
while unconscious himself of any unaccustomed or undue exertions, he
should find even his robust and stalwart strength was slowly failing
under his accumulated labors.

Informed by his medical adviser that an entire and continued rest
from all intellectual exertion was necessary to restore his nervous
energies to their wonted tone, he reluctantly accepted the decision.
A year ago he asked from the Smithsonian Regents authority to ap-
point two official assistants to relieve him from the greater portion of
his responsibility, and in hearty compliance with his expressed desire,
the eminent astronomer and physicist, Professor Langley, was ap-
pointed assistant in charge of the Smithsonian operations, and his
well-tried friend and collaborator, Professor Goode, was appointed
assistant in charge of the Museum affairs.

But the relaxation came too late. After a vigorous resistance of
his strong constitution to the encroachments of internal organic de-
rangements, he finally succumbed to the Destroyer, and quietly
SPENCER F. BAIRD. 729

breathed his last on the 19th of August, 1887; another example (far
more frequent in the higher than in the lower fields of occupation) of
sacrifice to over-work.

From even this hurried and imperfect sketch of Professor Baird’s
diversified administrative work it is at once apparent that he pos-
sessed, in a pre-eminent degree, two great capacities;—the faculty for
successful organization, and the faculty for continuous labor. As
a biologist he had made a study of the entire range of organic nature—
vegetable and animal; and with the accuracy of the specialist, he com-
bined the larger and fuller perception of the general zoologist as to the
functional and genetic inter-relations of animated being. The tenor of
his mind was rather synthetic than analytic. While he ever displayed
a marvellous memory for particulars, and a comprehensive grasp of
details, these were apprehended more as the constituents of a general
end or purpose, than as the residuals of a disjunctive conception.
Clear-sighted and determined, he prevised and compassed the result
in the means. Simple and unostentatious, he received with ready
affability a visitor, even when most pre-occupied. What young
naturalist ever applied to him for the resolution of a difficulty or un-
certainty without receiving cordial attention and satisfactory enlight-
enment ?

Great as were his undoubted services in the original discovery of
biologic truths, it may well be doubted whether his indirect influence
in the advancement of science, was not still greater, by the assistance
and encouragement given to others and by his numerous official ocea-
sions of directing the efforts of the aspiring into channels of novel
exploration, whenever the opportunities of land or naval expeditions
presented themselves.

Now that the first shock of bereavement at missing one who has
occupied a prominent place in the public eye, as well as in our private

the lamented death of Spencer F. Baird the scientific world has lost an

PROFESSOR BAIRD IN SCIENCE.

By Mr. Wo. H. DALL, President of the Biological Society.

In accepting the honor of addressing you this evening on the biolog-
ical work of Prof. Spencer F. Baird it is hardly necessary to state that
I have felt keenly the inadequacy of my own equipment for the task.
Not only does it happen that my own work has been almost entirely in
departments of biology different from those which he adorned, but my
early efforts were fostered by his wisdom and geniality, the period of
my scientific studies has coincided with an acquaintance which ripened
into affection and admiration, they have depended for their results upon
opportunities largely due to the intervention of Professor Baird, and L
feel that the best and truest of him is that which can not be put in
words. The sense of personal loss, as with many of you, is still so
keen as to accentuate the difficulty of doing justice to the theme
assigned me.

I should have almost despaired of myself on this occasion were it not
that others have aided me in my endeavor to set forth the debt owed
by the various departments of research to Professor Baird’s original
investigations. To naturalists so distinguished in their specialties
as Ridgway, Stejneger, Goode, Coues, Allen, Merriam, and Yarrow, I
am indebted either for direct contributions toward the substance of this
address or for matter in their published works which has been simi-
larly utilized.

Professor Baird’s scientific activity was exhibited in three principal
directions : First, in original investigation of the zoology of vertebrates ;
second, in the diffusion of scientific knowledge and methods through
official documents, reports, cyclopedias, and records of progress; and
lastly, in the organization and administration of scientific agencies such
as the National Museum or the Fish Commission, which include in their
scope not merely public education or economic applications of science,
but the promotion of research. Behind all these and hardly less im-
portant for science was the personal influence of the man himself, which
shone through all the planes of his activity as coruscations light the
facets of a gem.

Although it is very difficult to separate the phases of his work, one

from another, so closely were they inter-related, my theme to-night is
731

restricted to the impress left upon zoological science by Baird’s original
investigations. So great has been his reputation as an organizer, so
numerous have been the publications in which he has garnered for the
public the precions grain of the annual scientific harvest, that the extent
and importance of his original work, except by specialists, is in danger
of being overlooked.

We owe an excellent bibliography of his publications to Professor
Goode. From this we learn that, up to the end of 1882, the list com-
prises nearly eleven hundred titles, from which, after deduction of all
notices, reviews, Official reports, and works edited for others, some two
hundred formal contributions to scientific literature remain, many of
which are works of monographic character and extensive scope.

With the exception of a single early botanical paper these relate to
the vertebrates of America and, in their several branches, cover nearly
the entire field. Although descriptions of species in themselves afford
a poor criterion of the value of the work containing them, it is inter-
esting to note that, among the terrestrial vertebrates, the proportion of
the fauna first made known by Baird to the total number recognized at
the time as North American varied from twenty-two per cent. of the
whole to forty per cent. in different groups.

His method of study of new material was as far removed as possible
from bookishness. In the case of the collections from Hudson Bay or the
Pacific Railroad Surveys, when birds, mammals, or reptiles sometimes
came to hand by hundreds, each specimen having the collector’s data
attached, the whole collection was thrown together, each form to be
sorted out on its merits and studied in the light of a multitude of spec-
imens. ¢

Professor Baird’s early life had included so much of exercise in the
shape of long pedestrian journeys with gun and gamebag, so much
familiarity with the wood-life of his favorite birds and mammals, that
it would have been in any case impossible to class him with the closet-
naturalist, while to this knowledge he added a genius for thorough,
patient, and exhaustive research into all which concerned the subject of
his study, and a wonderful inventiveness in labor-saving devices for
labeling, museum work, and registration.

He had a wonderful capacity for work. He undertook and carried
out successfully tasks which it would seem nobody else would have
dared to attempt, or, attempting, would have been physically unable to
complete. In the case of the immense volume on the mammals of the
Pacific Railroad Surveys, he says in the preface, July 20, 1857:

The examination of the material was actually commenced early in
1855 and many of the articles written in that year or 1856. With the
continual accession of additional specimens it became finally necessary
to rewrite, alter, or extend all that had been prepared prior to the
present year (1857). It is to this that the frequent want of uniformity
is due, the time allowed not being sufficient in many cases to permit the

reworking of the whole matter. - - - It is, perhaps, unnecessary
to state that the matter of the present report is entirely original through-
SPENCER F. BAIRD. 133

out. - - - It is proper to state, that owing to various cireum-
stances, the work was necessarily passed through the press with a
rapidity probably unexampled in the history of natural-history printing,
allowing very little opportunity for that critical and leisurely examina-
tion so necessary in correcting a work of the kind. For most of the
time the proof has been furnished and: read at the rate of twenty-four
to thirty-two pages per day, nearly 400 pages having been set up, read,
and printed during the first half of July alone. Owing to the urgent
necessity for the speedy completion of the volume, no time was allowed
for the revision of the manuscript as a corplete work, nor, indeed, of
its separate portions, and, for much of the time, the preparation of
much of the manuscript was only a few hours in advance of its delivery
to the compositor.

The volume above referred to contains over 800 quarto pages and 42
plates. The manuscript was entirely prepared after 6 o’clock of work-
ing days which had been spent in the active administrative and execu-
tive work of the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
then unassisted by stenographer or other clerical supplement. Fortu-
nately for science Baird did not always have to work under such ecir-
cumstances, but the incident shows what he was capable of doing when
the occasion seemed to him to warrant it. Probably no other work of
equal importance, on any subject, was ever carried out under such
pressure.

Mammals.—Professor Baird’s contributions to a knowledge of North
American mammals, though less voluminous than those relating to
birds, are not less important. Previous to this time but one general
work on the subject had been published, that of Audubon and Bach-
man on the Quadrupeds of North America, which was issued in three
volumes, from 1846 to 1854.* Immediately after the completion of this
great work collections began to pour into the Smithsonian Institution
from the various exploring parties of the Pacific Railway surveys.
This material comprised so large a nninber of new species, and cast so
much light upon many previously doubtful points concerning the rela-
tions of species already described, that a revision of the whole subject
became necessary. Hence Professor Baird at once set about the prep-
aration of the book commonly known as the Mammals of North Amer-
ica. I have already alluded to the manner in which it was prepared.
This great work was rapidly pushed to completion and appeared in
185%, just three years after the publication of the last volume of Audu-
bon and Bachman’s Quadrupeds. It constitutes the eighth volume of
the Pacific Railroad Reports, and is a ponderous quarto of more than
800 pages, accompanied by numerous excellent plates.

Though published thirty years ago, this work still remains the stand-
ard general treatise on North American mammals. It contains no bio-
graphical matter, but consists wholly of technical descriptions. It
treats of all the mammals then known from the continent of North

*The volume on Mammals of Richardson’s Fauna Boreali Americana does not fal]
under this head, because it treats only of the northern portion of the continent,
T34 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

America north of Mexico, except the bats and the truly pelagic forms—
whales, sea-cows, and seals. The total number of known species was
increased nearly twenty-five per cent.

In fullness of synonymy, and in the correct assignment of species pre-
viously described, Professor Baird was much in advance of previous
workers. The descriptions, which are models of painstaking accuracy
and precision, are taken from the specimens themselves, and are accom-
panied by long tabies of measurements, the value of which more than
justifies the enormous expenditure of time necessary in their prepara-
tion. Much more attention was paid to craniological characters than
had been the custom with previous writers, which fact contributes
largely to the permanent value of the work.

Professor Baird’s long training as a careful observer, his power of
concentrating his knowledge of matters under investigation, the
wide scope of his information on nearly all departments of natural
science, his clear perception of details, together with his excellent
judgment, which was as marked in matters of minor detail as in those
requiring great executive ability, enabled him to draw conclusions
which subsequent accumulations of material have verified in a sur-
prising manner; in fact, his pre-eminent superiority as a systematic
zoologist is everywhere apparent.

Birds.—When the great interest he took in birds is considered, and
the long period over which his studies extended, it is somewhat sur-
prising to find that the number of separate papers on ornithology pub-
lished by Professor Baird sums up only some seventy-nine titles. It
is less to their number that he owed his fame as an ornithologist than
to their quality, combined with the fact that several of these publica-
tions covered practically the entire field of North American ornithol-
ogy, and were of the nature of monographs.

“His reputation was, indeed, established,” says Ridgway, “by the
first of his separate works, usually known and quoted as the “Birds of
North America,” though not published under this title until two years
after it had been printed by the Government as Volume IX of the
Pacific Railroad Reports. With the publication of this great quarto
volume, containing more than a thousand pages, in 1868, began what
has been fitly termed by Dr. Elliott Coues the “ Bairdian period” of
American ornithology. This period, covering almost thirty years, was
characterized by an activity in ornithological research and a rapidity
of advancement without a parallel in the history of the science.

Of the “ Birds of North America” Coues states* that ‘it represents
the most important single step ever taken in the progress of American
ornithology in all that relates to the technicalities.” The nomenclature
was entirely remodeled from that previously in current use, and for the
first time was brought abreast of the systematic acquirements of the
time. The synonymy of the work, in which is embodied the history of

SPENCER F. BAIRD. 735

investigation relating to each species, is more extensive, reliable, and
elaborate than any before presented. With few exceptions, citations
were original, and when, as occasionally happened, they were neces-
sarily at second-hand the fact was always indicated. The text com-
prised not only diagnoses and descriptions of each species, but extended
and elaborate commentary, comparisons, and criticisms.

In this learned and sagacious work Professor Baird was aided by
Cassin and Lawrence, two of the leading ornithologists of America. It
exerted an influence perhaps strongly and more widely felt than any of its
predecessors, Audubon and Wilson not excepted, and marked an epoch
in the history of American ornithology. The data original to and em-
bodied in this work have been used again and again by subsequent
writers with various modifications. Such a monument of original re-
search is likely to remain for an indefinite period a source of inspira-
tion to other writers, while its authority as a work of reference will al-
ways endure.

The publication of this work rendered possible the studies and prog-
ress of a large number of persons, who without it would hardly have
been able to enter the domain of scientific ornithology, but who, aided
by the book as a standard of reference and by the genial correspond-
ence and pregnant suggestions of its author, have made reputations of
more or less distinction for valuable and permanent original investiga-
tion. The number of those who profited by this stimulation has been
very large, and in this way arose what has been called* the Baird-
ian School of Ornithologists, a school characterized by exactitude
in matters of fact, conciseness in deductive statement, and care-
ful analysis of the sulject in all its various bearings. Its work
is marked by a careful separation of the data from the conclusions de-
rived from them, so that conclusions or arguments can be traced back
to their sources and duly weighed, while the writings of the older
European school afford little basis for analysis. In substance, accord-
ing to Dr. Stejneger, the European method required an investigator to
accept an author’s statements and conclusions on his personal respon-
sibility alone, while the method originated by Baird furnishes him with
tangible facts from which to make his deductions.

These distinctive features were still further developed by the publi-
cation in 186466 of the “Review of American Birds,” a work of un-
equaled merit, displaying in their perfection Professor Baird’s wonder-
ful powers of analysis and synthesis, so strongly combined in his treat-
ment of difficult problems. Although never completed, this work has
received unstinted praise from all competent to estimate it. It is said
on excellent authority that no other single work on American birds has
made so profound au impression on foreign ornithologists, notwith-
standing the fact that circumstances },revented it from being made
complete.

Although in his systematic work Professor Baird, like other natural-
ists, built partly on the scientific foundations laid by his predecessors
and contemporaries, always with due acknowledgment, the high value
of his work in this direction was largely due to an unerring instinct
which enabled him to recognize and confirm the best features of the
work of others and by adding material from his own lines of original
research to combine the whole into a fabric which was a distinet ad-
vance on anything previously offered to the scientifie world.

While the bent of his genius led him, in this as in other departments,
to devote a main proportion of his work to the systematic biology which
was the need of the time, and which, with the exploration and descrip-
tion upon which it is based, must always precede and lay the track for
the theoretical biology more in vogue to-day, it must not be supposed
that the work of Baird was confined to descriptive and systematic work.
With the latter in his publications are combined a host of biographical
data such as the field naturalist revels in. One of the earliest and most
pregnant papers bearing on mutations of specific forms which have been
contributed to the literature of evolution by American biologists is to
be found in his article on the “ Distribution and Migrations of North
American Birds” published in the American Journal of Science in 1866.*
In this paper, an abstract of a memoir presented to the National
Academy of Sciences in 1865, are to be found the germs of much of the
admirable work which has since been elaborated by other biologists on
the correlation of geographical distribution and the peculiarities of the
environment, with the modifications of color, size, and structure in the
forms of animal life, called species.

Unlike some of his contemporaries twenty years ago, the views of
Darwin excited in him no reaction of mind against the hypotheses then
novel and revolutionary. His friendly reception of the new theories
was so quiet and undisturbed that, to a novice seeking his advice and
opinion amid the clatter of contending voices, it seemed almost as if
the main features of the scientific gospel of the new era had existed
in the mind of Baird from the very beginning. His thorough appren-
ticeship in the study of details of structure and their expression in sys-
tematic classification, as well as his cautious and judicial habit of mind,
prevented him, notwithstanding his hearty recognition of evolutionary
processes, from falling into those exuberancies of utterance and hypoth-
esis characteristic of narrowness and immaturity which, within the
memory of most of us, have enjoyed a sort of vogue now happily on the
decline.

Batrachians and Ser; aird’s contributions to herpe-
tology began as early as 1849, his first paper being a revision of the
North American tailed batrachians which appeared in the Journal of
the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Excluding notices

published fourteen papers on this branch of science beside nine of which
he was the joint author with Charles Girard. His activity in original
work in this, as in some other directions, came to an end with the as-
sumption of the burden of administrative work required by the organ-
ization and development of the Fish Commission.

Many of his herpetological papers were elaborate studies. One of
the most important of the early memoirs was that on the reptiles of
Stansbury’s expedition to the valley of the Great Salt Lake, and another,
that on those collected by the United States exploring expedition un-
der Wilkes. The catalogue of North American Reptiles in the collec-
tion of the Smithsonian Institution is a classical work, serving to the
present day as a text-book for students of herpetology. In 1859 ap-
peared his great study of the reptiles collected by the parties engaged
in the explorations for a Pacific Railroad, a monument of patient re-
search and discriminating analysis. After this his contributions to
the subject were mostly short papers or announcements of new or inter-
esting facts.

At the time Professor Baird began his studies of the amphibia
little had been done for herpetology in America. The classical work
of Holbrook contained little more than descriptions of Southern species,
and the work of Duméril and Bibron was equally meager. Immense
collections were placed in Baird’s hands from the Western plains, and
the work upon these was necessarily in great part original. How well
this work was done is shown by the fact that, in spite of the changes
which are constant in zoological classification, nearly all the species
still retain the names he applied to them. The descriptions were so
carefully prepared that later students have never been troubled in
making their identifications.

Notwithstanding his multifarious duties in later years, Professor
Baird never lost his interest in these animals, and up to the last af-
forded every aid and encouragement to those studying them. Much
of the work done in this country by such herpetologists as Girard,
Kennicott, Hallowell, Cope, and others, found in his example and en-
couragement the stimulus which made it possible, was built on the
foundations which he laid, and owes its publication to agencies which
he promoted or controlled.

Fishes. Professor Baird’s contributions to ichthyological literature
number some fourteen or fifteen papers, chiefly of a descriptive charac.
ter, embodying the results of original research into the ichthyology of
western and southwestern America and of the marine fishes of New
Jersey and New York. Most of these papers were published jointly
with Charles Girard.

Besides these, however, he added more than four hundred titles to
the list of reviews, notices, reports, translations, and official documents
relating to economic ichthyology, fish culture, and the general progress
of the science. In this way he was instrumental in bringing together

H. Mis. 142——47
738 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

for the use and benefit of the English-speaking public the largest body
of facts relating to fish and fisheries ever prepared and digested for
such purposes by any individual or organization. Recognized by ex-
perts of foreign countries with one accord, as the most eminent living
authority on economic ichthyology, America owes to his fostering care
and unwearied labor the existence of a whole generation of ichthyolo-
gists, breeders of fishes, and inventors of appliances of all sorts for use
in connection with the taking, preservation, and increase of these ani-
mals. So thoroughly is this understood by all who are in any way
acquainted with American fish and fisheries, that to them this state-
ment will appear a truism.

It does not enter into the purpose of this address to enumerate the
economic results of the Commission which grew into such stately pro-
portions under his skillful and progressive leadership, nor yet to
enumerate the multitudinous researches in pure as well as economic
biology for which this organization has furnished material and means.
No more emphatic object-lesson of the vital relations existing between
research, as such, and the promotion of the material interests of man-
kind has ever been furnished to the so-called “practical man” than
that afforded by the work of the United States Fish Commission as
directed by Professor Baird.

Whether germane to the subject of scientific research or not, the
most narrow specialist can hardly grudge an allusion to the grandeur
of the methods by which the food supply of a nation was provided,
hundreds of rivers stocked with fish, and the very depths of ocean
re-populated. Typically American we may call them in their audacity
and their success. The fishery boards of foreign countries, first quietly
indifferent, then loudly incredulous, in due time became interested
inquirers and enthusiastic followers. In a few years we may fairly
expect to see the food supply of the entire civilized worid materially
increased, with all the benefits which that implies, and this result will
in the main be owing to the unremunerated and devoted exertions of
Spencer F. Baird.
THE PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PROFESSOR BAIRD.

By J. W. POWELL, President of the Anthropological Society.

Baird was one of the learned men of the world, and, to a degree per-
haps unexampled in history, he was the discoverer of the knowledge he
possessed. He knew the birds of the air, from the ptarmigan that lives
among everlasting snows to the humming-bird that revels among the
orchids of the tropics; he knew the beasts of the forests and the prai-
ries, and the reptiles that crawl through desert sands or slimy marshes;
he knew the fishes that scale mountain torrents, that bask in quiet
lakes, or that journey from zone to zone through the deep waters of the
sea. In all this realm of nature he had a minute and comprehensive
knowledge that no other man has ever acquired. What others had
recorded in this field of research he knew, and to their discoveries he
made a contribution of his own so bounteous, so stupendous, that he is
recognized as the master of systematic zoologists.

All of Baird’s scientific work is an illustration of modern inductive
or scientific reasoning. The inductions or general principles of modern
science are reached by the accumulation of vast stores of facts. He
knew how to accumulate facts; how to reject the trivial and select the
significant. Modern science is almost buried under the débris of obser-
vation, the record of facts without meaning, the sands of fact that are
ground from the rock of truth by the attrition of mind; but Baird could
walk over the sands and see the diamonds. Then he knew how to
marshal significant facts into systems, and how to weld them into funda-
mental principles. In all his works there can be discovered no taint of
a priori reasoning or syllogistic logic; for in his mind there was no
room for controversy; and disputation fled before the light of his
genius. Formal logic, a disease of modern thought, the contagion of
Aristotleina, never ravaged his brain. With healthful directness, he
sought the truth guided by wise inference, and told the truth in its
simplicity.

Baird was an organizer of the agencies of research. When a bold
explorer essayed to penetrate the seas of ice by the path of peril and
in quest of fame, Baird would ever so manage that a corps of quiet
scholars should be attached to the expedition to study the climate of
the Arctic zone, the geology of the Arctic rocks, the flora of the Arctic
lands, or the fauna of the Arctic fields; and the best knowledge we
have of the igloo-dwellers, the Eskimo whose home is on the ice of the
North, has been brought to us by the quiet students he succeeded in
attaching to Arctic exploring expeditions, and so the love of glory
was made to serve the cause of truth.

When, in the interests of international commerce, expeditions were
sent to explore and survey routes of travel and transportation across
Central America from sea to sea, he managed to send with them corps
of scientific men whose function it was to bring from the tropics all
forms of its abundant life, vegetal and animal, and the relics of the
arts uf the people of Central America as they are exhibited in stone
and clay and gold; and the National Museum has been enriched by
the results of this labor, and the boundaries of human knowledge
extended thereby, and so the greed of gain was made to serve the
love of truth.

When our Army was distributed on the frontiers of the land, he every-
where enlisted our scholarly officers in the service of science and he
transformed the military post into a station of research; the Indian
campaign into a scientific expedition. Scott, Marcy, McClellan,
Thomas, and many other of the great generals of America were stu-
dents of natural history and collectors for Baird. When our Navy
cruised around our shores its officers were inspired with that love of
nature which made every voyage of military duty a voyage of discov-
ery in the realms of natural science; when they journeyed among the
islands of the sea they brought back stores of scientific materials, and
when they sailed through the littoral waters of other continents they
made voyages of scientific investigation. Many of these earlier
naturalists of the Navy in subsequent times became commodores and
admirals.

But time would fail me to tell of the exploring expeditions and the
railroad surveys throughout America, and the travels throughout the
world, which he utilized in the interest of science, or of which he was
the immediate projector. Of the abundant material thus gathered from
all parts of the world, some has gone to enrich American institutions
of learning, and some has been gathered into the National Museum,—
an outgrowth of Baird’s organizing genius and a splendid monument
to his memory.

The hills of the land stretch not so far as the billows of the sea;
the heights of the mountains are not so great as the depths of the
ocean ; and so the world was unknown until this greater region was
explored. ‘The treasures of the land did not satisfy the desires of
SPENCER F, BAIRD. TAL

Baird; he must also have the treasures of the sea, and so he organized
a fish commission, with its great laboratories and vessels of research.

What hid’st thou in the treasure-caves and cells,

Thou hollow-sounding and mysterious main ?

Pale, glistening pearls and rainbow-colored shells,

Bright things which gleam unreck’d of, and in vain.

Keep, keep thy riches, melancholy sea!

We ask not such frum thee.

What the scholar asked of the sea was all its forms of life, its organ-
isms minute and lowly, its crawling articulates, its pearl-housed mol-
lusks, its fishes that swim in armies, and its leviathans that prowl
among the waves—the life of the reedy shore, the life of the ocean-
current, and the life of the deep sea. Thus with many ingenious appli-
ances, he and his lieutenants sailed away to explore the ocean’s
mystery.

So the Fish Commission was an agency of research; but it was more,—
he made it an agency by which science is applied to the relief of the
wants of mankind,—by which a cheap, nutritious, healthful, and luxur-
ious food is to be given to the millions of men. He affirmed that for
the production of food an acre of water is more than equal to 10 acres
of land, thus giving to the gloomy doctrine of Malthus its ultimate refu-
tation, and tearing away the veil of despair from the horizon of the
poor; for, when the sea shall serve man with all the food that can be
gathered from its broad expanse, the land can not contain the millions
whom it is thus possible to supply.

In the research thus organized the materials for the work of other
scientific men were gathered. When a great genius reads to the world
a chapter from the book of nature the story is so beautiful that many
are stimulated to search in the same field for other chapters of the same
story. Thus it was that the publication of Baird’s great works on
natural history developed in America a great corps of naturalists,
many of whom have become illustrious, and the stimulus of his work
was felt throughout Europe. In the research which he organized the
materials were furnished for this corps of naturalists; but his ageney
in the development of this body of workers was even more direct. He
incited the mea personally to undertake and continuously to prosecute
their investigations. He enlisted the men himself, he trained them
himself, he himself furnished them with the materials and instruments of
research, and best of all, he was their guide and great exemplar. Thus
it was that the three institutions over which he presided,—the Smith-
sonian Institution, the National Museum, and the Fish Commission—
were woven into one great organization,—a university of instruction in
the methods of scientific research, including in its scope the entire field
of biology and anthropology. Such is Baird the investigator, Baird
the organizer, and Baird the instructor, in the length breadth and
height of his genius, the solidarity of a great man.
742 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

All that I bave said is a part of the public record, found in the
great libraries of the world; but however exalted the feeling of ad-
miration we may entertain for Baird as a scholar and administrator,
it is to his attributes as a man, as disclosed in his personal relations
with friends, associates, and men of affairs, that we most fondly turn.
It is in these relations that he most clearly exhibited those kindly and
modest traits of character which made him so universally beloved.

As aman of affairs, Professor Baird exhibited great sagacity. His
plans for the organization of scientific work were of great magnitude,
and had they been presented to the administrative officers of the
Government or to legislative bodies with exaggeration, or even had
they been presented with the glow of an enthusiastic missionary of
science, they might well have encountered opposition. But Baird had
a wonderful faculty of presenting his plans with extreme modesty,
and with a degree of under-statement, but suggestion of possibilities
which speedily caused him to whom the appeal was made, himself to
become an advocate of the Professor’s measure. He had traits of char-
acter in this respect which are hard to explain, and which seem at first
to be contradictory. In the advocacy of measures his modesty amuunted
almost to timidity; he avoided alike argumentation and ostentation,
and he presented his measures with the directness of a child. Not-
withstanding all this, there was such a poise of faculties, such dig-
nity of mien, that he impressed those with whom he came in contact
as a venerable and wise patriarch. He seemed devoid of personal in-
terest or feeling, and solicitous only for the welfare of those to whom
he was in fact appealing, and he conveyed the impression that he was
giving benignant advice. Thus the shrinking, sensitive man, who
could not even stand before a public body, such as a committee of Con-
gress, or a scientific society, and advocate a cause, could from his seat
by the fireside or at the desk, so illumine the subject with which he
had to deal that men stood round him to gather his words, that noth-
ing should be lost; for in the exposition of his subject he illumined
everything with clear statement, arising from an exhaustive knowledge
and full understanding of results.

As the director of the work of research in which other men were en-
gaged, Professor Baird had marvellous insight and skill. The appli-
ances of modern research, alike in the inorganic world and in biology,
have come to be multifarious and diverse, and there is this peculiarity
about them ;—once used, so that the secret of nature which they
were planned to unlock has been revealed, they speedily become
obsolete, and immediately new keys, new apparatus, new devices are
necessary. Thus to a large extent skill in research is absorbed in the
Skil necessary for the development of the agencies of research. A
continuous line of research, prosecuted by a corps of men so that the

here that Baird exhibited his skill. His own devices were many and
constant, and he was ever fertile in suggestions to his assistants. No
wonder, then, that so many of the secrets of nature were unlocked
through his agency. It was in the direction of this work of research
that the man Baird stood forth as a giant ; it was where his vast knowl-
edge of details was most apparent; it was where his marvellous skill
was most shown; it was where his insight into human character was
most exhibited. With clearness he formulated his interrogatories ;
with aptness he selected his course of procedure; with judgment he
sought the aid of others, and with suggestiveness directed their work,
And, lo! his questions were speedily answered. It was in this manner
that his own good hands were supplemented by the hands of many,
that his own great mind was re-enforced by the best mental activity of
many assistants; and thus the whole body of men under his control
worked together as one organic integer for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.

In his work with his assistants he scrupulously provided that every
one should receive the meed of honor due for successful research and
be treated all with generosity. Many an investigation begun by himself
was turned over to assistants when he found that valuable conclusions
could be reached ; and these assistants, who were his warm friends, his
younger brothers, reaped the reward; and he had more joy over every
young man’s success than over the triumphs and honors heaped upon
himself from every quarter of the globe. He was the sympathetic
counsellor of many men; into his ears were poured the sorrows and
joys of others, and he mourned with the mourning and rejoiced with
the rejoicing. To those in need his hand was ready and his purse was
open, and many were the poor who called him “blessed.” Though a
man of great force of character, a man of great learning, a man upon
whom had been showered the honors of the scientific world, in char-
acter he was as simple as a child. He hada fund of ‘ folk-lore,” and
loved the books and papers written for children. In his later years,
weakened with disease and burdened with many labors, he still read
‘6 St. Nicholas ” from month to month, and kept the run of every little
story, and was glad to be “a child again.” His life at home was pure
and sweet, and full of joys, for he gave and received love and trust
aud tender care. But the history of his home life is sacred. Its words
and acts abide in the hearts of the wife and the daughter.

For many long months he contemplated the day of parting. Labor
that knew no rest, responsibility that was never lifted from his
shoulders, too soon brought his life to an end. In the summer of the
past vear he returned to his work by the seaside, that he might die in
its midst. There at Wood’s Holl he had created the greatest biologic
laboratory of the world; and in that laboratory, with the best results
of his life-work all about him, he calmly and philosophically waited
for the timeof times. Three days before he died he asked to be placed

in a chair provided with wheels. On this he was moved around the
pier, past the vessels which he had built for research, and through the
laboratory, where many men were at work at their biologic investiga-
tions. For every one he had a word of good cheer, though he knew
it was the last. At the same time, along the pier and through the
laboratory, a little child was wheeled. “ We are rivals,” he said, ‘‘ but
I think that I am the bigger baby.” In this supreme hour he was
playing with a child. Then he was carried to his chamber, where he
soon became insensible, and remained so until he was no more.
‘¢ Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”
A MEMOIR OF ASA GRAY.*
3y JAMES D. DANA.

Our friend and associate, Asa Gray, the eminent botanist of America,
the broad-minded student of nature, ended his life of unceasing and
fruitful work on the 30th of January last (1888). For thirty-five
years he has been one of the editors of this Journal, and for more than
fifty years one of its contributors; and through all his communications
thereisseen the profound and always delighted student, the accomplished
writer, the just and genial critic,.and, as Darwin has well said, “the
lovable man.” t

Asa Gray was born on the 18th day of November, 1810, at Sauquoit,
in the township of Paris, Oneida County, New York, a place 9 miles
south of Utica. When a few years old his father moved to Paris
Furnace, and established there a tannery; and the child, one account
says, was put to work feeding the bark-mill and driving the horse, and
another, riding the horse that ground the bark. ‘At six or seven he
was a champion speller in the numerous ‘matches’ that enlivened the
district school.” At the age of eleven, nearly twelve, he was sent to
the grammar school at Clinton, where he remained for two years, and
the following year to the Fairfield Academy, both of the schools places
where all the classics and mathemetics were taught that were required
for entering the colleges of the land. But his instruction was cut short
by his father’s desire that he should enter the Fairfield Medical School.
This school, of high repute, was established at that place in 1812 as
the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Western District
of New York. Dr. James Hadley was the professor of chemistry and
materia medica, and his lectures of 182526, while Gray was in the
academy, and 1826~27, after he had taken up medicine, gave the young
student his first instruction in science. During the following winter at
Fairfield, that of 182728, the article on Botany in the Edinburgh
Encyclopedia attracted young Gray’s attention, and excited his interest

fessor Goodale, Professor Sargent and Prof. C. R. Barnes, the last in the Botanical

so deeply that he at once bought a copy of “ Katon’s Botany” and
longed for spring. As spring opened, ‘he sallied forth early, discov-
ered a plant in bloom, brought it home, and found its name in the
manual to be Claytonia Virginica, the species C. Caroliniana, to which
the plant really belonged, not being distinguished then.” From this
time collecting plants became his chief pleasure. He finished his
medical course, and in the spring of 1831 took his degree of Doctor of
Medicine—to him the basis for a title, but not for future work.

This ended his school and college days. As Gray’s scientific educa-
tion was carried forward without the aid of a formal scientific school, so
it was with his literary studies. He had not the benefit of university
training, and yet became eminent for his graceful and vigorous English,
the breadth of his knowledge, his classical taste, and the acuteness of
his logical preceptions. |

Before the close of the medical course he had opened correspond-
ence about his plants with Dr. Lewis C. Beck, a prominent botanist of
Albany, and had had a collection named for him by Dr. John Torrey, of
New York. Moreover, about this time he delivered his first course of
lectures on botany, as substitute for Dr. Beck, and made use of the fees
that he received for the expenses of a botanical excursion through
western New York to Niagara Falls. Gray also delivered a course of
lectures at Hamilton College, Clinton, on mineralogy and botany, for
Professor Hadley, in the college year of 183334, a biographical sketch
of Professor Hadley, of Fairfield, by his son, the eminent Professor of
Greek at Yale, stating that his father, who gave up his lectures at this
college in 1834, “‘ supplied his place during the last term by a favorite
pupil and much valued friend, Dr. Asa Gray, who commenced under
Professor Hadley the studies which were to make him pre-eminent
among the botanists of his time.” Professor Hadley, the sketch says,
had studied botony at New Haven, Connecticut, in 1818, under Dr. Eli
Ives, an excellent botanist of that place, and mineralogy and geology
under Professor Silliman.

In the autumn of 1831 Gray became instructor in chemistry, miner-
alogy, and botany at “‘ Bartlett’s High School,” in Utica. The scientific
department of the school had been under the charge of a graduate of
Eaton’s * Rensselaer School,” at Troy—the earliest school of science
in America—and Professor Eaton’s practical methods of instruc-
tion in chemistry, mineralogy and botany were there followed. Great
was the delight of the boys in botanical and mineralogical excursions
with Mr. Fay Egerton, and their pleasure, too, in the lectures on chem-
istry. In 1830 the writer left the Utica High School for Yale College ;
and a year later, Mr. Egerton having resigned on account of his health,
Gray took his place. We had then no acquaintance and knew nothing
of one another’s interest in minerals and plants. My minerals and
herbarium went with me to New Haven; and while I was there Gray
was mineralizing as well as botanizing, during his vacations, in New
ASA GRAY. 747

Jersey and western and northern New York. His first published paper
is mineralogical,—an account of his discoveries (along with Dr. J. B.
Crawe) of new mineral localities in northern New York. It is con-
tained in the twenty-fifth volume of the American Journal of Science,*
and the title gives Utica as his place of residence. He had previously
made excursions after plants, fossils and minerals in New Jersey, and
in 1834 joined Dr. Torrey in botanizing, besides collecting for him in
the “pine barrens” of New Jersey and other places.

In the autumn of 1834 Gray accepted the position of assistant to Dr.
Torrey in the chemical laboratory of the Medical School of New York.
Botany was at first his study under Dr. Torrey, but soon his work with
Dr. Torrey; and here commenced their long-united labors and _ publi-
cations. From the first he showed himself an adept in his methods of
investigation and in his terse and mature style of scientific description.
During the year 1834, while Torrey was preparing his monograph on
the North American sedges, the Cyperaceve, Gray had in hand an illus-
trated memoir on the genus Rhynchospora, in which he doubled the
number of known North American species; and another also on ‘‘New,
rare, and otherwise interesting plants of northern and western New
York.” Both papers were read before the Lyceum of Natural History
of New York in December of that year (1834), and are published in
volume I of the Annals of the Lyceum. Dr.Torrey’s monograph was
read on the 8th of August, 1836; and in it he says that the part on
the genera Rhynchospora and Ceratoschcenus was prepared by Dr.
Gray, and that his descriptions are so full, that he gives only his list of
the species, with such alterations as he has thought it advisable to
make, and some additional matter received since the publication of his
paper. During 1834, 1835, two volumes of a work on North American
Graminez and Cyperacez were issued by him, (each containing a hun-
dred species, and illustrated by dried specimens, )—now rare volumes,
as only a small edition was published through private subscription.
The first of these volumes, issued in February, 1834, only three years
after his graduation at the Fairfield Medical School, is dedicated to
his instructor and friend Dr. James Hadley. The preface acknowl-
edges his indebtedness to Dr. Torrey and to Dr. Henry P. Sartwell, of
Penn Yan. Of the species described as new in the work, the first one,
No. 20, from specimens collected by Dr. Sartwell, turned out to be
Nuttal’s Calamagrostis confinis. But the next one, No. 28, Panicum
xanthophysum, from the vicinity of Oneida Lake, stands and is the
first of the thousands of good Asa-Gray species. Thus Gray’s botani-
cal investigations were well begun before his twenty-fifth year had
passed.

*Page 346. The article is in the second number of the volume, which was issued
Jaunary 1, and is without date; the one following it is dated September 6, 1833.
The paper therefore was probably written in the autumn of 1833, after a summer’s
excursion.
748 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

In February or March of 1835 he gave his last instruction at the
Utica High School. He expected to continue as Dr. Torrey’s assistant
the following season; but ‘the prospects of the Medical School were
so poor that Dr. Torrey could not afford to employ him.” He never-
theless returned to New York in the autumn, took the position of curator
and librarian of the Lyceum of Natural History, and continued his
botanical investigations. During the summer he had begun the prep-
eration of his “ Elements of Botany,” and in the course of 1836 the
work appeared. It showed the scholar in its science and in its style.
The subjects of vegetable structure, physiology, and classification were
presented in a masterly manner, though within a small compass. The
book moreover showed his customary independence of judgment and
clear head in various criticisms and suggestions,—later investigations
sustaining them, much to his gratification.

The Wilkes Exploring Expedition came near making a profound im-
pression on Gray’s life. In the summer of 1836 the position of botanist
in the expedition was offered him and accepted. But delays occurred
in the time of sailing, and changes were threatened that threw uncer-
tainties over the cruise, and for these reasons, and on account of the
work on the North American Flora, of which, by invitation of Dr.
Torrey, he was to be joint author, his resignation was sent in the foi-
lowing year. The expedition changed its commander from Commodore
Patterson, over a ship-of-the-line, to Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, with a
squadron of two sloops-of-war (better adapted for the purpose), besides
other vessels, six in all, and sailed in August, 1838. The four years
abroad would have given him an opportunity for observations and dis-
coveries that would have rejoiced him—excursions in Madeira, the
Canaries, to the Organ Mountains in Brazil, a brief look about Orange
Bay near Cape Horn, excursions to the Andes of Chili and about lower
Peru, over Oregon and Washington Territory, and parts of California,
through numerous island groups of the South and North Pacific, in
Australia and New Zealand, about Luzon in the Philippines, at Singa-
pore, at Cape of Good Hope and St. Helena—and his open mind would
have gathered in facts on the relations and geographical distribution
of species that would have been to him a mine of wealth as science ad-
vanced under Darwin’s lead. The place of botanist in the expedition
was well occupied by the most excellent, indefatigable, and many-sided
zoologist Dr.Charles Pickering, and by Mr. William D. Breckenridge, a
Scotch gardener and zealous collector, and Mr. William Rich; but with
Dr. Gray, devoted to the one subject, great results would have been
accomplished. North American botany however would no doubt have
suffered.

By October of 1838, a couple of months after the sailing of the Explor-
ing Expedition, two parts of the projected “ Flora” were already out.
But so many doubtful points had been brought tolight, that a study of
foreign herbaria had become imperative. Dr. Gray had accepted, dur-
ASA GRAY. 749

ing the summer, the chair of botany in the recently founded University
of Michigan, but with the condition that he should have a year abroad
for study; and the year was given to this object. All the herbaria of
Europe were carefully examined with regard to the type-specimens of
American plants, and full notes taken for use in the discrimination and
identification of species. The fortieth volume of the American Journal
(April, 1841) opens with a highly interesting paper by him, giving ac-
counts of these herbaria, their contributors, condition, and special char-
acters, commencing with that of Linnzus and the story of its career before
reaching the Linnean Society of London. His labors abroad involved
an immense amount of detailed and exact observation, requiring
thorough knowledge, excellent judgment, and a retentive memory; and
he came home well stored for the work which he and Torrey had in
hand.

Moreover, he made during the trip the personal acquaintance of the
leading botanists of England and the Continent, and had from all a
cordial reception.

‘In Glasgow he made the acquaintance of William Jackson Hooker,
the founder of the greatest of all herbaria, the author of many works
upon botany, who had already published a large part of his “Flora
Boreali-Americana,” in which were described the plants of British
North America, a work just then of special interest to the young Ameri-
can, because it first systematically displayed the discoveries of David
Douglas, of Drummond, Richardson, and other English travelers in
North America. At Glasgow, too, was laid the foundation for his life-
long friendship with the younger Hooker, then a medical student seven
years his junior, but destined to become the explorer of New Zealand
and Antarctic floras, the intrepid Himalaya traveler, the associate of
George Bentham in the authorship of the ‘‘Genera Plantarum,” a presi-
dent of the Royal Society, and, like his father, the director of the Royal
Gardens at Kew. At Edinburgh he saw Greville, the famous erypto-
gamist; while in London, Francis Boott, an American long resident in
England, the author of the classical history of the genus “ Carex,” and
at that time secretary of the Linnean Society, opened to him every bo-
tanical door. Here he saw Robert Brown, then the chief botanical fig-
ure in Kurope, with the exception, perhaps, of De Candolle; and Men-
zies, who fifty years before had sailed as naturalist with Vancouver on his
great voyage of discovery ; and Lambert, the author of the sumptuous
history of the genus “ Pinus,” in whose hospitable dining-room were
stored the plants upon which Pursh had based his North American
Flora. Here, too, he met Bentham and Lindley and Bauer, and all the
other workers in his scientific field.

“A visit to Paris brought him the acquaintance of the group of dis-
tinguished botanists then living at the French capital: P. Barker
Webb, a writer upon the botany of the Canaries; the Baron Delessert.
Achille Richard, whose father had written the Flora of Michaux; Mir-

bel, already old, but still actively engaged in investigations upon vege-
table anatomy; Spach; Decaisne, then a young aide naturaliste at the
Jardin des Plantes, of which he was afterward to become the distin-
guished director; Auguste St. Hilaire, the naturalist of the Duke of
Luxembourg’s expedition to Brazil, and at that time in the full enjoy-
ment of a %reat reputation earned by his works upon the Brazilian flora ;
Jacques Gay; Gaudichaud, the naturalist of the voyage of L’Uranie and
La Physicienne; the young Swiss botanist Edmond Boisser, the Spanish
traveler, and later one of the most important contributors to systematic
botany in his classical “ Flora Orientalis ;” Adrien de Jussieu, grand-
nephew of Bernard, and son of Laurent de Jussieu, himself a worthy
and distinguished representative of a family unequaled in botanical
fame and accomplishment.

“At Montpellier Dr. Gray passed several days with the botanists
Delile and Dunal, and then hurried on to Italy, where at Padua, in the
most ancient botanical garden in Europe, he made the acquaintance of
Visiani, at that time one of the principal botanists in Italy. At Vienna
he saw the learned Endlicher, the author of a classical ‘* Genera Plan-
tarum;” and at Munich, Von Martius, the renowned Brazilian traveler,
the historian of the palms, and the earliest contributor to that stupen-
dous work the “ Flora Brasiliensis,” which bears his name; and here, too,
was Zuccarini, the collaborator with Von Siebold in the “Flora Ja-
ponica.” Geneva then—as at the present time, was a center of scientific
activity; and there he made the personal acquaintance of the De Can-
dolles, father and son, and worked in their unrivalled herbarium and
library. He saw Schlechtendal at Halle; and at Berlin, Klotzsch, Kunth,
and Ehrenberg,—familiar names in the annals of botanical science.
Alphonse De Candolle and Sir Joseph Hooker alone are left of the bril-
liant group of distinguished naturalists who cordially welcomed the
young American botanist in 1839.” *

Dr. Gray also, while abroad, performed a great service for the Uni-
versity of Michigan in superintending the selection of works for the
nucleus of its library ; and the University showed its appreciation of his
judgment and of the benefit to the institution, by honoring him and
itself at its semi-centennial celebration the past summer by conferring
on him the degree of Doctor of Laws.

Again at home, and now well equipped for conquering difficulties
about American species, he went at the Flora with new vigor. The first
volume was completed by Torrey and Gray in 1840 and the second in
February, 1843. In the interval between these dates, during the sum-
mer of 1841, Gray spent five to six weeksin a botanical excursion through
the vailey of Virginia to the summits of the high mountains of North
Carolina. <A letter about the trip, addressed to Sir William J. Hooker,
published in this Journal in 1842, first gives an account of the excur-

John Fraser, of the last century, and John Lyon, Michaux the younger,
Pursh, Nuttall, Curtis, and others, of this, mentioning their discoveries,
with critical remarks on the species they observed and on their distri-
bution; and then he describes his own journey, adding notes on the
plants met with by the way and in the mountains, commencing his ob-
servations at Harper’s Ferry. His journey among the North Carolina
mountains included the ascent of the “‘ Grandfather,” 5,897 feet in eleva-
tion, and the Roan Mountain, 6,306 feet. This is one among a number
of such excursions.

Another labor of this period was the revision of his “Elements of
Botany,” which, without much change of general method, he made a
far more comprehensive and thorough treatise, and in 1842 issued under
the title of the ‘‘ Botanical Text-book.” Since then successive editions
have appeared with large advances, as the science required. By the
fifth edition, that of 1879, the subject had so expanded that it wa’ di-
vided, and the work made to include only Structural Botany, covering
Morphology, Taxonomy and Phytography, leaving Physiological and
Cryptogamic botany to other hands. The second volume, an exposition
of Physiological Botany, appeared in 1885 from the pen of his colleague,
Prof. G. L. Goodale. A third volume on Cryptogamic Botany is prom-
ised by another colleague, Prof. W. G. Farlow.

Gray never entered on duty at the Michigan University, it beng im-
possible for him to carry on his publications so far away from the New
York herbaria and botanical libraries. In 1842 he was invited by the
Fellows of Harvard College to the Fisher Professorship of Natural
History, recently founded on a bequest by Dr. Joshua Fisher. The
duties of the professorship included the delivery of a course of lectures
on botany, and the direction of a small botanic garden which had been
established in Cambridge in 1805, under the auspices and with the
assistance of the Massachusetts Society for promoting Agriculture.
Thomas Nuttall had charge of the garden from 1822 to 1828, and after
that it was without a head until the appointment of Dr. Gray. The
garden was still poor in funds, and had not even a herbarium to aid
Gray in his botanical studies. But he entered on the duties with zeal,
conducted the required lectures in the most lucid and attractive man-
ner, freely gave the use of his study to such students as wished to learn
more of the science than they could acquire from the lectures, and
gathered a vast herbarium. And all the time he carried on an enor-
mous correspondence with promptness, and answered all social demands
with unfailing courtesy, besides continuing his botanical investigations
and writing books and memoirs. These duties continued until 1872,
when he was relieved from that of teaching and the charge of the
garden. In 1864 he made the offer to Harvard College of the herbarium
and library which he had gathered, already very large, on conditio.a of
their erecting a fire-proof building to contain them, which was avcepted,
152 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

Botanical work was always in progress in some form. One of the
very valuable parts of it consisted in his contributions to the American
Journal of Science,—which were continued, with scarcely any interrup-
tion, for the love of the science and of the men engaged in it. Every
important work as it was issued was here noticed, with often critical
remarks, or additional facts and illustrations, or modifications of opin-
ions, that gave them great scientific value. And not the least instruc-
tive and attractive part were the biographical sketches of deceased
botanists, European as well as American; for to him the world was all
one, and all-botanists were akin. He was sure to criticise what he be-
lieved to be wrong; but it was done so fairly, with so evident a desire
for scientific accuracy, and in so kind a spirit, that offense was rarely
given. A botanist of eminence says that ‘these notices form the best
history of.the botanical literature of the last fifty years, and of the prog-
ress and development of botanical science, that has been written.”

The fortieth volume of this Journal (1841) contains an admirable
example of his kindly method of reviewing an author that had faults,
and of his critical study among great difficulties. It is a review of the
botanical writings of Rafinesque, that enthusiastic naturalist, poet, etc.,
with reference, not to his faults, but to the value to be attached to his
numerous genera and species and their recognition in American Botany.
Throughout there is a full appreciation of Rafinesque’s sagacity in many
of his discriminations, a fair presentation of his scientific claims, of his
love of nature and greater love of self, without a harsh word for his
errors or egotism; and only a citing of a sentence here and there, ora
fact, that enables Rafinesque to make his own presentations as to his
species and genera, with a bare mention of his “twelve new species of
thunder and lightning.”

The publication of the second volume of the ‘ Flora,” in 1843, ended
that work. The territory of the United States afterward took larger
dimensions, and new fields were to be explored before a complete
“Flora” could be published. ‘Torrey was engaged on these studies
until his death in 1873; and Gray also was publishing memoirs that
were contributions to the subject. Gray’s various memoirs include—
descriptions of the collections made by Lindheimer, in western Texas
(1843~48); by Fendler, in New Mexico (1846-47); by Wright, near the
boundary of Texas and Mexico (1849 and 185152); by Thurber, along
the United States and Mexican boundary (185152); the Botany of vari-
ous Government surveys, and other Government reports, and a portion
of the Botany of California. Other papers are distributed through the
publications of learned societies, especially the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences of Boston, which contains hundreds of pages of them,
the Proceedings of the Philadelphia and California Academies, the
Boston Society of Natural History, the Linnean Society of London, ete.

Further, the plants of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, exclusive
of the ferns and those from western North America, were early sent to
ASA GRAY. 153

him for description; and in 1854 appeared his Report, in quarto, accom-
panied by a folio atlas, containing a hundred plates.

Gray was three times over the Rocky Mountain region to the Pacific
coast. On the second trip he was accompanied by Sir Joseph Hooker;
and an important paper on the “Vegetation of the Rocky Mountain
Region” by them is published in the Reports of the Hayden Geological
Survey for 1878. He was in Europe again in the years 185051. A note
from Mrs. Gray says, ‘“*He went abroad especially for the plants of the
Wilkes Expedition. After traveling in Switzerland (going up the
Rhine to Geneva, where he worked awhile in DeCandolle’s herbarium),
we went to Munich and saw Martius, and then back to. England by
Holland. On the first of October we went into Herefordshire to the
country place of George Bentham, and spent two months there, Mr.
Bentham going over with Dr. Gray the gollection which had been
sent out from America, a most generous piece of work.” It was at this
time, while at the Kew Gardens, near London, that he had the passing
introduction to Darwin, alluded to in Darwin’s first letter to him.*

In 1868 he crossed the ocean the fourth time, going in September and
returning in November of the following year. He was hard at work
over herbaria at Kew during both autumns, and worked also in Paris,
Munich, Geneva, and elsewhere, but with more holiday than in any
journey he took, except the last. In this visit he was twice with Dar-
win, first in the autumn of 1868, and then in October, 1869.

After forty years of studying and discriminating among the older
species of the continent and their representatives abroad, and of de-
scribing species from late discoveries, and of work at classification, with
experimental work at Flora-making during the years 1838 to 1843, he
was finally ready, in 1878, with the first part of a new North American
“Flora,” to which he gave the name of ‘Synoptical Flora of North
America.” This first part contained the Gamopetale after the Com-
posite. A second part was published in 1884, comprising the Capri-
foliacez to the Composite inclusive, or the ground of the second vol-
ume of Torrey and Gray’s Flora; so that the middle half of the entire
Florais now completed. The two parts cover 974 closely printed pages.
‘«They are masterpieces of clear and concise arrangement, and of com.
pactness and beauty of method, and display great learning and ana-
lytical power.” The progress of the science since the time of Michaux
is well exhibited in the fact that while this author knew 193 species of
Composit when he published his Flora, Gray, seveuty-five years later,
describes no less than 1,636 species under 239 genera.

During these years Dr. Gray added to the resources of the instructor
in Botany by the publication of his ‘Manual,” a descriptive work
including all species growing east of the Mississippi and north of Ten-
nessee and North Carolina. It was first issued in 1848, and its fifth and
last edition in 1868. The “Elementary Lessons in Botany and Vege-

table Physiology,” also, was published first in 1868, as an accompani-
ment to the Manual, and has had its five editions at nearly the same
dates. The first volume of another companion work to the Manual was
issued in 1848,—his ‘“ Genera Illustrata,” containing descriptions of the
genera of the United States Flora, with illustrations of great beauty
by I. Sprague; and in 1849 a second volume was published, carrying
the works nearly to the Leguminose; and here it stopped, on account
mainly of the expense. His ‘ Field, Forest, and Garden Botany,” a
useful flora for schools, came out in 1868; and the charming smaller
volumes, “ How Plants Grow” and “ How Plants Behave,” respectively
in 1858 and 1875. The latter was prompted by Darwin’s works on
Insectivorous Plants, the Orchids, and Dimorphism, and both are well
adapted to the young student and all uninitiated readers.

Besides the subjects of Gray’s investigations already mentioned, two
others of a wider philosophical character interested him deeply: one,
in which he was pioneer, the other, the Origin of Species, after Darwin.

The first of these subjects was the Geographical Distribution of
Plants, and particularly the species of the northern United States
both within and beyond the bounds of the continent, and the bearings
of the facts on variation and origin.

His first paper on the subject is contained in volumes XXII and XXIII
of the American Journal of Science, the numbers for September, 1856,
and January and May, 1857. It was written partly in compliance with
the request of “an esteemed correspondent” for a list of American
alpine plants, who, as now appears, was Darwin. Darwin’s Life con-
- tains, on page 420, the letter, and shows that its date was April 25,
1855; and, also, a second letter of June 8, 1855, which opens thus: “I
thank you cordially for your remarkably kind letter of the 22d ult., and
for the extremely pleasant and obliging manner in which you have taken
my rather troublesome questions. I can hardly tell you how much your
list of alpine plants has interested me.” And then Darwin puts more
questions to his genial correspondent.

The long paper, modestly entitled ‘Statistics of the Flora of the
United States,” contains numerous tables, comparing as regards plants
the northern United States with Europe on one side, and Asia and
Japan on the other; the eastérn part of the country with the western,
and with the adjoining continents in the north temperate zone; the
plants of alpine and subalpine regions in the northern United States,
and their distribution southward and eastward and westward over the
other continents; the distribution of species common to this country
and Europe, as to size of orders and genera; also, as regards related
aud representative species, and the same for eastern and western
America; lists of species of widely sundered habitation; with numer-
ous other points, and abundant explanatory remarks; making thus a
thorough philosophical digest of the subject of geographical distribu-
tion, having all the completeness as respects the northern United

States that the existing state of the science admitted of. He closes
with a general review of the characteristics of the North American
flora.

In the course of the pages, he advocates the idea of a single area of
origin for a species, with dispersion at an epoch more or less ancient,
to account for distribution; sustains Darwin’s “surmise” as to the
species of large genera having a greater geographical area than those
of small genera; observes that a large per-centage of the extra Euro-
pean types of eastern America are shared with eastern Asia, and
finds ‘* that, curiously enough, eleven, or one-third, of our strictly alpine
species common to Europe—all but one of them arctic in the Old
Worid—are not known to cross the Arctic circle on this continent; so
that it seems almost certain that the interchange of alpine species
between us and Europe must have taken place in the direction of New-
foundland, Labrador, and Greenland, rather than through the polar
regions” (XXIII, 73).

Two years later, in 1859, Dr. Gray had studied a collection of plants
from Japan (alluded to in the former paper, XXIII, 369, as in hand),
which had been collected by Mr. Charles Wright; and his memoir on
the subject, read that year before the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, closes with a sequel to the subject of Geographical Dis-
tribution, bringing out conclusions of still higher interest. He starts
off with the then new announcement and its evidence, that among the
plants of Japan, more species are represented in Europe than over the
nearer land, western North America; more in eastern North America
than in either of the other two regions; and adds, that hence, there
has been a peculiar intermingling of the eastern American and eastern
Asia floras, which demands explanation. The explanation he finds in
the idea of migrations to and from the arctic regions, determined in
part, at least, by the climate of the preglacial, glacial, and postglacial
eras, and that the alpine plants of thessummits of the White Mount-
ains, Adirondacks, Black Mountains, and Alleghanies are species left
by the retreating glacier.

Dr. Gray returned to this subject in his presidential address, in 1872,
before the American Association for the Advancement of Science,*
and, owing to the progress that had been made in the paleontology of
the continent, the aretic portion as well as the more southern, and de-
velopments elsewhere also, he was enabled to trace out the courses of
the migrations of plants, the Sequoias or Redwoods and many other
kinds, by positive facts with regard to the arctic and more southern
floras; and showed that the distribution southward into the western
United States, into eastern Europe or western Eurasia, and into Japan
and Asia or eastern Eurasia, was not only dependent, as he had before
put forth, on change in continental climates, but also that the particu-
lar direction southward was determined to a large extent by fitness of

climate as to heat and dryness. The surprising revelations are now so
generally known that this brief reference to them is all that is here
needed.

Gray’s comprehensive knowledge of the plants of the world, of their
distribution, and specifically of the relations of North American species,
genera, and orders to those of the other continents, and the precision
of his knowledge, enabled him to be of much service to Darwin in the
preparation of the first edition of the Origin of Species, and afterward,
also, in the elaboration of Darwin’s other publications. His mind was
not very strongly bound to opinions about species, partly because of
his natural openness to facts, his conclusions seeming always to have
only a reasonable prominence in his philosophical mind, rarely enough
to exclude the free entrance of the new, whatever the source, and toa
considerable extent from the difficulties he had experienced in defining
species and genera amidst the wide diversities and approximate blend-
ings which variation had introduced.

Darwin, in a letter to Gray written during the following summer,
having in view Gray’s article in this journal, and another discussion of
his—published in the proceedings of the American Academy, Says,
“JT declare that you know my book as well as I do myself, and bring to
the question new lines of illustration and argument in a manner which
excites my astonishment and almost myenvy.” ‘As Hooker lately said
in a note to me, you are, more than any one else, the thorough master
of the subject.”

Gray’s ‘‘Darwiniana,” published in 1876, is composed of a number of
his essays and reviews, from the American Journal of Sciencé, the
‘‘Nation” and the “Atlantic Monthly,” together with a closing chapter,
written for the volume, entitled ‘Evolutionary Teleology.” The last
chapter brings out Gray’s adherence to the doctrine of natural selec-
tion, and also his divergence from true Darwinism. These divergences
are thus expressed:

“We are more and more convinced that variation, and therefore the
ground of adaptation, is not a product of, but a response to, the action
of the environment. Variations, in other words the differences between
individual plants and animals, however originated, are evidently not
from without, but from within; not physical, but physiological.” And
elsewhere he has said that the variation in aspecies is apt to take place
in particular directions and make linear ranges of varieties, as often ex-
emplified among plants; which accords with the preceding conclusion,
pp. 386.

Again speaking of the forms of Orchids and their connection with,
and relation to, insect fertilization, he says: ‘We really believe that
these exquisite adaptations have come to pass in the course of nature,
and under Natural Selection, but not that Natural Selection alone ex-
plains or in a just sense originates them. Or, rather, if this term is to_
stand for sufficient cause and rational explanation, it must denote or in-
ASA GRAY. T57

clude that inscrutable something which produces, as well as that which
results in the survival of, ‘the fittest,” p. 388.

Neither of these doctrines is strictly Darwinian, though not at variance
with Natural Selection. They take away what has often been urged
against Darwinism: the idea that the environment under Natural Se-
lection dominates in the determination of the direction of variation, and
hence that evolution comes chiefly through external conditions; and
substitutes the idea that the environment works under organic control
through Natural Selection. One view implies that the environment in-
fluence is superior to organic law in the process; the other, that organic
law is superior to the environment. Moreover, Gray’s last sentence ex-
presses the opinion that Darwin’s Natural Selection can not produce
the “survival of the fittest,” though “survival of the fittest” is the result
brought about. There is an ‘inscrutable something” that “produces.”
The writer would go a little farther and say that the ‘survival of the
fittest,” under ‘“‘natural selection,” is survival, not the production of
“the fittest;” but this substitute I have reason to believe that Gray
would not accept.

Further, Gray was a theistic Darwinian, as abundantly shown in his
“ Darwiniana,” and alike also in his ** Natural Science and Religion.”
Here is his creed in his own words, as published in the preface to the
Darwiniana: “| am scientifically and in my own fashion a Darwinian,
philosophically, a convinced theist, and religiously, an acecepter of the
‘creed commonly called the Nicene,’ as the exponent of the Christian
faith.”

Gray’s various literary or less scientific papers, contributions mostly
to the ‘‘ North American Review,” “Nation,” and the “Atiantic
Monthly,” always show the clear thinker, the graceful writer, and the
well-stored head, whatever the topic; and when it is scientific, his method
of popularizing and illustrating his views is of the most attractive kind.
His last contribution to the *‘ Nation” was a long characteristic notice
of Darwin’s Life and Letters, in November, showing no waning in his
faculties; on the contrary, there is manifest the same clear-headed,
judicial, and sprightly reviewer, as honest as ever in his opinions and
in his modesty amid Darwin’s profuse (he says effusive) commendations.

The last visit to Europe was made during the past year. He went
with the intention of doing but little of his herbarium work, and find-
ing pleasure among friends old and new. Mrs. Gray, as usual, was
with him. It proved to be a triumphal time to the modest botanist,
for he received the honor of doctorate from each of the great universi-
ties of Britain, that of Oxford, of Cambridge, and of Edinburgh. He
returned in October in excellent spirits and health—an apparent prom-
ise of some years more of work. He was soon again occupied with his
“Flora,” the completion of which was the earnest desire of all botanists.
Yet while wishing to see its last page himself, his anxiety about it had
lessened in later years, because aware that his colleague in charge of
758 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

the Herbarium, Dr. Sereno Watson—one of the students that he had
gathered about him—was capable of taking up the lines whenever he
should lay them down. .

Gray’s standing among philosophers abroad, is manifested in his
recent reception in Great Britain. It is further shown in his having
been elected an honorary member of all the principal academies or
societies of science in Europe, including the Royal Society of London
and the Institute of France. He was president of the Association for
the Advancement of Science in the year 1871, and has been one of the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution since 1874; and for ten years,
from 1863 to 1873, he was president of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences. In 1884 his portrait in bronze, made by St. Gaudens,
was presented to Harvard College.

One of the most gratifying testimonials from his fellows in science
was received on his seventy-fifth birthday. To his surprise there came
greetings or notes of congratulations from every American botanist,
old and young, and, along with the notes, a silver vase embossed with
figures of the plants more particularly identified with his name or
studies. It was delightful to witness, says one of his associates, his
child-like pleasure as he received the gift. Among the letters were
some from friends who were not botanists. The following lines were
from Mr. Lowell:

Just FATE: prolong his life, well spent,
Whose indefatigable hours

Have been as gaily innocent
And fragrant as his flowers.

The vase is about 11 inches high exclusive of the ebony pedestal.
The pedestal is surrounded by a hoop of hammered silver on which is
the inscription:

1810 November eighteenth 1885
ASA GRAY
In token of the universal esteem
of American Botanists

Among the flowers, in raised figures about the vase, the place of
honor on one side is held by Grayia polygaloides, and on the other by
Shortia galacifolia. On the Grayia side, the prominent plants are
Aquilegia Canadensis, Centaurea Americana, Jeffersonia diphylla, Rud-
beckia speciosa and Mitchella repens ; and on the Shortia side, there are
Lilium Grayi, Aster Bigelovii, Solidago serotina, and Epigwa repens.
The lower part of the handles runs into a cluster of Dionza leaves,
which clasps the body of the vase, and their upper part is covered with
Notholena Grayi. Adlumia cirrhosa trails over the whole back-ground,
and here and there its leaves and flowers crop out. The greetings, in
the form of cards and letters, that had been sent by the givers of the
vase, were placed on asimple but elegant silver plate, which had within
the engraved inscription: Bearing the greetings of one hundred and

eighty botanists of North America to Asa Gray, on his seventy-fifth
birthday, November 18th, 1885.*

Botanists have, as their common object of interest, that part of Nat-
ure which seems by its free gift of beauty and fragrance (without a
trace of self, the dominating element in the animal) fully to reciprocate
affection; and there is hence a reason for that feeling of fraternity which
such a giffso beautifully expresses, independently of the tribute in it to
the botanist of botanists. Plants seem thus to select from among inquir-
ing minds those which are to be their investigators, or the botanists.

Darwin first mentioned to Gray his view that ‘‘species arise like
varieties with much extinction,” in a letter to Gray of July 20, 1856.t
At this time all men of science with a rare exception believed in the
permanence of species. J. D. Hooker’s Flora Indica of 1855 ‘‘assumes
that species are distinct creations.” { Professor Huxley, in his history
of the reception of Darwinian ideas, says, with the perfect fairness that
always has characterized him, that ‘‘ within the ranks of the biologists,
at that time [1851-58], I met with nobody [and he here includes him-
self] except Dr. Grant, of University College, who had a word to say
for evolution; and his advocacy was not calculated to advance the
cause. Outside of these ranks, the only person known to me whose
knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who was, at the same
time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Herbert Spencer. - - -
But even my friend’s rare dialectic skill and copiousness of apt illustra-
tion could not drive me from my agnostic position.” Lyell, he shows,
was leaning that way, but not himself. So it was in 1857, and in 1858
up to the publication of Darwin’s and Wallace’s papers of that year.§

Gray therefore knew of Darwin’s views before the biologists of
Britain, unless we except Lyell and J. D. Hooker. Darwin acknowl-
edged Gray’s ‘remarkably kind letter” on the 5th of September, 1857,||
and was prompted by his ‘extraordinary kindness,” and evidently by
his assurances, that he had no objections to facts from any source, had
great interest in the subject, and only saw some “ grave difficulties ”
against his doctrine, to explain to Dr. Gray with detail, under six
heads, the prominent facts and arguments in the theory of *‘ Natural
Selection,” which he says is the “title of his book.” ‘This letter is the
- first exposition that Darwin had made of his theory, and hence it has
proved to have great documentary value.

A letter which the writer received from Gray in the interval be-
tween Darwin’s two letters, dated December 13, 1856, shows well the
state of his mind at that time. He says: * On the subject of species,
their nature, distribution, what system in natural history is, etc., cer-

which contains also good figures of the vase.

tain inferences are slowly settling themselves in my mind or taking
shape; but on some of the most vexed questions, I have as yet no
opinion whatever, and no very strong bias, thanks partly to the fact
that I ean think of and investigate such matters only now and then,
and in a very desultory way.” *

In a letter of a year later, subsequent in date to Darwin’s letter,
Gray wrote me with reference to my paper on “ Species,” read at the
meeting of the American Association in August, 1857,—which paper
may be taken, perhaps, as a culmination of the past, just as the new
future was to make its appearance,—pointing out to me the fatal objec-
tion to my argument.

His words (dated November 7) are worth quoting: “Taking the
cue of species, if I may so say, from the inorganic, you develop the
subject to great advantage for your view, and all you say must have
great weight in ‘reasoning from the general.’ But in reasoning from
inorganic species to organic species, and in making it tell where you
want it, and for what you want it to tell, you must be sure that you are
using the word species in the same sense in the two; that the one is
really the equivalent of the other. That is what I am not yet convinced
of; and so to me the argument comes only with the force of an analogy,
whereas I suppose you want it to come as demonstration. Very likely
you could convince me that there is no fallacy in reasoning from the one
to the other to the extent you do. But all my experience makes me
cautious and slow about building too much on analogies, and until
I see further and clearer I must continue to think there is an essential
difference between kinds of animals or plants and kinds of matter.

‘‘ How far we may safely reason from the one to the other is the
question. If we may do so even as far as you do, might not Agassiz (at
least plausibly) say that as the species Iron was created in a vast number
of individuals over the whole earth, so the presumption is that any
given species of plants or animals was originated in as many individuals
as there are now, and over as wide an area; the human species under
as great diversities as it now has, barring historical intermixture; thus
reducing the question between you to insignificance? because, then, the
question whether men are of one or of several species would no longer
be a question, or of much consequence. You may answer him from
another starting point, no doubt; but he may still insist that it is a
legitimate carrying out of your principle.”

In the same letter Gray prophesies as follows, from actual knowledge,
it now appears: “You may be sure that before long there must be
one more resurrection of the development theory in a new form, obviating
many of the arguments against it, and presenting a more respectable
and more formidable appearance than it ever has before. “

.

The Origin of Species was out in November, 1859. Gray received an
early copy of it from Darwin, and therefore his very valuable review
was ready for the American Journal of Science early in 1860.* ,

With regard to the sufficiency of the argument brought forward in
Darwin’s work, Gray says that “To account upon these principles for
the gradual elimination and segregation of nearly allied forms—such as
varieties, sub-species and closely related or representative species,—and
also for their geographical association and present range, is compara-
tively easy, is apparently within the bonds of possibility, and even of
probability.” But as to the formation of genera, families, orders, and
classes by natural selection, Gray simply states Darwin’s arguments on
the subject, and some objections on a few weak points, without express-
ing further his own views. He concludes with some remarks on the
religious bearing of a theory that refers creation to natural law and
declares rightly, in accordance with his firm faith to the end, that
‘Natural law is the human conception of continued and orderly Divine
action.”

It is a case of natural selection. But Dr. Gray was more to bota-
nists than a friend and leader. He was the “ Beloved Gray”—the
object of their admiration and devotion on account of his goodness, his
high principle, his frank independence, his unfailing cordiality, and the
clearness of his intellectual vision, like that of a seer. He stands be-
fore the world as a lofty example of the Christian philosopher.

Dr. Gray was married in 1848 to the daughter of the late eminent
lawyer of Boston, Charles G. Loring. His excellent and accomplished
wife, who survives him, was in full sympathy with him in all his pur-
suits and pleasures, a bright, cheerful and helpful companion, at home
and in his travels abroad.

November last, the month after his return from Europe, he put aside
his nearly completed revision of the *‘ Vitacez, or Grape-vines of North
America,” to write his last words about Darwin in the review of Dar-
win’s Life and Letters, and to prepare his usual annual Necrology for
this Journal. The latter manuscript lay unfinished on his table when,

any time of his powers of speech, and toward evening of that day
passed quietly away.

Asa Gray’s remains lie buried in the Mount Auburn Cemetery. Amer-
ican botanical science, wrought out so largely in its details, its system,
and its philosophical relations, by his labora, is his monument.
MEMOIR OF ASA GRAY.*

By Prof. WILLIAM G. FARLOwW.

Asa Gray was born on November 18, 1810, in Sauquoit Valley in the
township of Paris, Oneida County, New York, and died on January 30,
1888, at Cambridge, Massachusetts. On the paternal side he was de-
scended from a Scotch-Irish family who emigrated to this country in the
early part of the last century. His grandfather, Moses Wiley Gray,
was born at Worcester, Massachusetts, December 31, 1745, and was
married in 1769 to Sallie Miller. He went in 1787 to Vermont, where
his wife soon afterwards died; and when their son Moses, the father of
Asa Gray, was eight years old, the father and son moved still farther
west, to Sauquoit Valley, then almost a frontier settlement. Sixteen
years later, Moses Gray was married to Roxana Howard, a daughter of
Joseph Howard, of English descent, who, leaving his home in Massa-
chusetts, had settled in Sauquoit Valley the same year as the Gray
family. Of their family of eight children, five sons and three daughters,
Asa was the first-born.

When a boy he assisted his father in the smaller duties connected with
his farm and tannery; but at an early age he showed a much greater
fondness for reading than for farm work, and the father soon came to
the conclusion that his son would make a better scholar than farmer.
Until he was about twelve years old the only education he received was
what could be obtained for a partof the year in the small district school,
and in the small private school at Sauquoit taught by the son of the
parish pastor. He was then sent to the grammar school at Clinton,
New York, where he remained for two years ; and when, in the autumn
of 1825, his teacher, Mr. Charles Avery, accepted a place in Fairfield
Academy, young Gray followed his instructor to that place, where for
four years he pursued elementary mathematical and classical studies,
Connected with the Fairfield Academy was a medical school which
enjoyed a high reputation, and was attended by two hundred students,
a large number for that time. Dr.James Hadley, the professor of Ma-
teria Medica and Chemistry in the Medical School, also gave some in-

*Memorial address before the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; June 13,
1888. ;

764 BIOGRAPHIGAL MEMOIRS,

struction in the academy, and it was probably through his influence
that Gray’s attention was first strongly drawn towards natural science.
Apparently, he was not at first so much interested in plants as in miner-
als; and it was not until towards the close of his course in the acad-
emy that his passion for plants was aroused by reading the article on
botany in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia, and his delight the following
spring at being able to make out with the aid of Eaton’s Manual the
scientific name of the common Claytonia is now a well known story.

Following his father’s wish, which probably was in accord with his
own inclination, he decided to study medicine, and formally entered the
Fairfield Medical School in 1829, although for two years previously,
while a student in the academy, he had attended some of the medical
lectures. The sessions of the medical school, like those of the acad-
emy, hardly occupied more than six months of the year, and the re-
mainder of the time was spent in study with different physicians in the
neighborhood of Sauquoit, one of whom, Dr. John F. Trowbridge, of
Bridgewater, was a man of good scientific attainments. He was thus in
an excellent position for collecting, and even before he graduated he
had brought together a considerable herbarium, and had entered into
correspondence with Dr. Lewis C. Beck, of Albany, and Dr. John Tor-
rey, of New York, who aided him in the determination of his plants.
He received his doctor’s degree at Fairfield on February 1, 1831. He
never, however, entered upon the practice of medicine; but after re-
ceiving his degree he became instructor in chemistry, mineralogy, and
botany in Bartlett’s High School at Utica, New York, and taught
those subjects, for a part of the year, from the autumn of 1831 to 1835.

The first actual record of any public lectures on botany given by him
is found in a circular of the Fairfield Medical School, dated January,
1832, in which the following statement is made: *‘Asa Gray, M. D.,
will give a course of lectures and practical illustrations on botany,
to commence {in June] and continue the same time with the lectures
on chemistry [six weeks]. Fee, $4” This course was attended
apparently by ten persons; for he states that he spent the $40 earned
from these lectures in making a botanical excursion to Niagara Falls.
It appears to be the case however that in the previous year, just after
graduation, he had given a few lectures on botany in the medical
school, in the absence of the regular instructor, Dr. Beck; and a little
later, he gave another course of lectures on mineralogy and botany at
Hamilton College, Clinton. During other intermissions of his work at
Bartlett’s school, he made mineralogical and botanical excursions to
different parts of New York and New Jersey; and it was while liv-
ing at Utica that he published in the American Journal of Science of
October, 1833, his first scientific paper on new mineral localities in
northern New York, written in connection with Dr. J. B. Crawe.

In the autumn of 1833, having leave of absence from Bartlett’s School,
he accepted the position of assistant to Prof. John Torrey, in the chem-

«dell
ASA GRAY. 765

ical laboratory of the Medical School of New York. His time was
here mainly occupied in botanical studies; and, besides aiding Dr.
Torrey in his botanical work, he prepared and published several original
papers of his own, of which his memoir on Rhynchospora may be said
to be his first contribution to descriptive botany. His connection with
Bartlett’s School ended early in 1835, and, although the financial con-
dition of the New York Medical School did not permit his continuing
as assistant of Dr. Torrey, he returned to New York in the autumn of
1835, and accepted the position of curator and librarian of the Lyceum
of Natural History, a position which gave him leisure for continuing
his botanical studies, and to prepare his first text-book, “Elements of
Botany,” which appeared in 1836.

About this time a Government expedition, since known as the Wilkes
Exploring Expedition, was fitting out, and the position of botanist of
the expedition was offered to Dr. Gray in the summer of 1836. The
expedition did not sail, however, until two years later; and meanwhile,
wearied by the numerous delays and uncertainties about the manage-
ment of the expedition, Dr. Gray resigned his position and settled in
New York, where, in company with Dr. Torrey, he worked energetically
on the preparation of the earlier parts of the ‘ Flora,” of which the
first two parts appeared in October, 1838. While occupied in this work,
a new State University had been founded in Michigan, and Dr. Gray
accepted the chair of botany which was offered to him, with the under-
standing that he-should be allowed to spend a year abroad in study
before beginning his official duties. '

The elaboration of the new “ Flora” made it necessary for him to
examine the types of American plants in foreign herbaria; and in
November, 1838, he started on the journey which was not only to give
him the means of clearing up much of the existing confusion with re-
gard to the identity of previously described North American species,
but, what was more important, was to bring him into close scientific
and social relatious with the botanical lights of a generation now long
past, and with those who were then the young men of promise, a brill-
iant group, of which Sir J. D. Hooker and A. De Candolle are now
almost the only survivors.

He returned to America in November, 1839, but never assumed the
duties of professor at Michigan. He was absorbed in his work on the
‘¢ Flora,” and refreshed and stimulated by what he had seen and heard
abroad, he was pushing rapidly ahead with the second volume, of which
he wrote the greaters portion, and at the same time printing a *‘ Bo-
tanical Text-Book,” which was to form the basis of his many subse-
quent text-books, when he was invited to Cambridge to fill the newly
endowed chair of the Fisher Professorship of Natural History in Har-
vard College.

He accepted, and in 1842 took up his residence in Cambridge. The
second volume of the “ Flora” was completed the following year. He

was at once favorably received in learned and social circles of Cam-
bridge and Boston; and when delivering a course of lectures at the
Lowell Institute, he first became acquainted with Miss Jane Lathrop
Loring, daughter of Mr. Charles Greely Loring of Boston, to whom he
was married on May 4, 1848. From this time his energies were devoted
to building up a botanical establishment at Cambridge—for what was
in existence before 1842 hardly deserves mention—and to the comple-
tion of a “ Flora of North America.” The number of collectors and
explorers had by this time greatly increased, and the material they had
brought together contained so much that was new, that it was plain
that the original plan of the “‘ Flora” must be changed, for the two
volumes already published had hardly appeared when a revision seemed
necessary. It was not until many years later, in 1878, that the first part
of the new “* Flora” appeared ; and he continued to labor toward the
completion of his great work until death forced him to relinquish the
unfinished task.

He continued in the exercise of the active duties of lecturer and
instructor until 1872, when he was relieved of this charge by the ap-
pointment of a colleague, Prof. G. L. Goodale; but he gave occasional
lectures in the college for a few years longer. In 1873 he resigned his
office of Director of the Botanic Garden, and Prof. C. 8. Sargent was
appointed his successor. He retained the title of Fisher Professor and
Director of the Herbarium until his death, although he was in part
relieved of the responsibilities of the latter position by the appoint-
ment of Mr. Sereno Watson as Curator of the Herbarium in 1874.

His long residence and arduous labors at Cambridge were varied and
relieved by several journeys, some of which were of considerable extent,
and all of which were made to contribute to the advancement of work
on the “Flora,” either by enabling him to examine in the field the
plants which he was studying, or by examination of foreign herbaria,
and consultations with leading foreign botanists. He made three trips
to California, in 1872, in 1877, when he was in company with Sir J. D.
Hooker, and in 1885, when he visited not only southern California and
the great Colorado Canon, but journeyed into Mexico as far as Orizaba
and Cordoba. He was once in Florida, in 1875, and made, besides,
several trips to the mountains of North Carolina, where he botanized at
different times with his botanical friends, Sullivan, Carey, Engelmann,
Canby, and Redfield.

He made in all six journeys to Europe, including the journey already
mentioned and a short business trip of six weeks to Paris in the sum-
mer of 1855. On the other journeys he was accompanied by Mrs. Gray.
When abroad, he always spent much of his time with the English
botanists, among whom he counted many warm personal friends; and
he looked forward with special pleasure to his visits at Kew, where he
was welcomed by the director, Sir W. J. Hooker, and by his son and
successor, Sir J. D. Hooker, for forty years his intimate friend, whose
ASA GRAY. 767

opinion in botanical matters he esteemed more highly than that of any
of his contemporaries. In his second journey, from June, 1850, to
August, 1851, he traveled through France, Germany, and Holland,
and spent two months with Bentham at his home in Herefordshire,
studying the plants of the Wilkes Expedition, upon which he was then
working. The fourth journey, from September, 1868, to November,
1869, was undertaken at a time when he was much overworked, and
he spent the winter in Egypt, that country being almost the only spot
where there was nothing to tempt him to botanize, besides visiting
Italy, France, Germany, and England. The event of the journey of
September, 1880, to November, 1881, was a trip to Spain, a country
where he obtained much relief from Botany.

His last journey, on which he started in 1887, was a triumphant
farewell, in which were heaped upon him honors bestowed on few
naturalists. He visited friends in France, Austria, and Germany ;
stopped at Geneva to see De Candolle, his life-long friend, older by
four years than himself, and sorrowfully bade him what both must have
felt to be a last farewell; then hurried back from the continent to
receive the doctor’s degree from the three great British Universities,
and to attend the meeting of the British Association at Manchester.
Here he saw many old friends, and met for the first time three of Ger-
many’s most distinguished botanists—Cohn, Pringsheim, and the
lamented De Bary, whose untimely death was to come but a few days
before his own. At Manchester he was brought into contact with a
large number of young botanists, who were charmed with his genial
manner, and astonished at his well preserved vigor of body, as well as
mind. He returned to America in October, apparently in perfect
health, and resumed active labor on the “Flora;” but while busied
with the preparation of the Vitacee for that work, he was suddenly
stricken with paralysis, on the morning of November 28, and lingered
in a partially conscious condition until the evening of January 30,
when he passed calmly away.

By the death of Asa Gray this academy has lost a member whose
activity and zeal were unceasing, and whose brilliant talents as a scien-
tific writer, not surpassed by those of any of the illustrious names on
our roll, added much to the reputation of the society at home and abroad.
Elected a corresponding member in 1841, he became an active member
in 1842, on his settlement in Cambridge, and served as corresponding
secretary from 1844 to 1850, and again from 1852 to 1863, and as presi-
dent from 1863 to 1873. During this long membership of more than
forty years his attendance was always exemplary. The storms of
winter and the inclemencies of spring, which kept younger men at
home, did not prevent his coming from the remote Botanic Garden
regularly to attend the meetings. Although an honorary member of
most of the learned societies of this country, and of many of the most
prominent societies of Europe, including the Royal Society of London,
768 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

the French Academy, and the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg, of
which he was one of the very few Americans who bave been elected
corresponding members, this Academy was the society in which he
felt the greatest interest and was most at home.

There are few volumes of our Proceedings which do not contain im-
portant communications from his pen. One of the earliest of his works,
the “ Chloris Boreali-Americana,” was printed in the third volume of the
Academy’s Memoirs, in 1846; and to subsequent volumes he contributed
“Plante Fendlerianz Novi-Mexicane,” presented in November, 1848;
‘Plante Nove Thurberiaue,” and “ Note on the Affinities of the Genus
Vavea, Benth., also of Rhytidandra, Gray,” August and October, 1854;
and a group of four papers, entitled ‘* Botanical Memoirs,” in 1859, in-
cluding one “On the Botany of Japan, and its Relations to that of
North America ”—a remarkable essay on the geographical distribution
of plants, which stamped the author as worthy to rank with the great
botanists of the world. We need not enumerate his many papers
which have appeared in the Proceedings of the Academy, for they alone
would fill several volumes. It was his custom to embody the results
of his preliminary studies on the North American flora in the form of
notes on critical species, descriptions of novelties, and monographs of
genera, and sometimes orders, of which by far the greater part first
appeared in our Proceedings, usually under the heading of ‘ Botanical
Contributions,” a long and very valuable series, dating from the paper
“On some New Composite from Texas,” presented December 1, 1846,
and ending with the posthumous *“ Notes upon some Polypetalous
Genera and Orders,” presented April 19, 1888. Nor should we forget
the many biographical notices in which he commemorated the lives and
works of others with an appreciating discrimination, written in a man-
ner peculiarly his own.

The botanical department of Harvard University was practically
created by Asa Gray. In 1805 a small botanic garden was established
at Cambridge, under the auspices and by the aid of the Massachusetts
Society for Promoting Agriculture, and William Dandridge Peck was
appointed director and professor of botany. In 1818 he printed a “Cat
alogue of American and Foreign Plants cultivated in the Botanic Gar-
den, Cambridge,” in which one thousand three hundred and nine species
were enumerated; but the list included some common cryptogams found
everywhere, and a large number of phernogamic shrubs and weeds,
common natives of the region, hardly to be counted as legitimate mem-
bers of a botanic garden. Professor Peck died in 1822, when, owing
to the low state of the funds, a professor was not appointed, but Thomas
Nuttall, the well-known botanist and ornithologist, was appointed
curator of the garden, and later, lecturer on botany. This amiable,
but very reticent naturalist—who apparently did not find his residence
in Cambridge very congenial (for he describes himself as vegetating
like his plants), —resigned his position in 1833, and returned to Phila-

delphia. The garden, such as it was, was then put under the charge
of William Carter, a gardener, and the lectures on botany were given
‘by T. W. Harris, the well-known entomologist and librarian of the
college, and Dr. A. A. Gould, of Boston. Not long before 1842, the
directorship of the garden was offered to Mr. George B. Emerson, of
Boston, who declined the position soon afterwards accepted by Dr.
Gray in connection with the Fisher professorship.

On Dr. Gray’s accession there was no herbarium, no library, only
one insignificant greenhouse, and a garden all in confusion, with few
plants of value. In 1844 he moved into the house which had been
built for Professor Peck in the Garden, and with his characteristic
energy he soon brought together an herbarium and library, and ar-
ranged the Garden systematically. At the time of his marriage a
small wing was added to the house, of which the lower story served
as a study and herbarium until 1864. But the plants soon overran
the limits of the herbarium, and finally the whole house was crammed
with plants—plants in the dining-room, in the attic, in the closets,
and in the bedrooms; for whatever he could spare from a salary of
$1,000 at first, and $1,600 afterwards, was spent on his herbarium
and library. In 1864, dreading the danger from fire to a collection
kept in a wooden house, he offered to present his collections to the
college, on condition that a suitable building should be erected for
their reception. Through the liberality of Mr. Nathaniel Thayer of
Boston, a brick building to be used as an herbarium and library was
erected in 1864, at a cost of $12,000; and mainly through the agency
of Mr. G. B. Emerson, a further sum of $10,000 was raised, the income
of which was to be used in defraying the current expenses of the her-
barium. From a letter by Dr. Gray to the president of the university,
dated November 20, 1864, and a notice in the American Journal of
Science, of March, 1865, we learn that the herbarium then contained at
least 200,000 specimens, and the library about 2,200 botanical works,
not including a good many pamphlets. There was also a set of 335
very costly illustrated works, contributed by Mr. John A. Lowell.

Since 1864 the herbarium has been constantly enlarged, principally
by exchanges, of which those from the Kew Herbarium especially were
of very great value; so that itis now probably twice as large as in 1864,
and forms practically a National Herbarium, for it is by far the largest
and most valuable herbarium in America, and is excelled in size by but
few of the older and richer herbaria of Europe, as those at Kew, Paris,
Berlin, the De Candolle Herbarium at Geneva, and possibly that at St.
Petersburg. In the representation of the phenogams of North America
outside the tropics, it is probably unequalled by any herbarium except
that at Kew. The library at the time of Professor’s Gray’s death was
roughly estimated to contain something over 5,000 volumes and 3,000
pamphlets, but these figures are probably too low. Many of the addi-
tious since 1864 are the gift of Dr. Gray. In building up this vast

H. Mis. 142——49
T70 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

collection, he gave not only much of his time and thought, but also an
actual sum of money, which comes well up in the thousands, and, to
crown all, manifested his devotion to the welfare and perpetuation of
the collection by bequeathing to the university for its support the
royalties on his publications.

The Garden during his administration was improved by the addition
of several greenhouses, in which were cultivated a choice selection of
exotics, and the rather limited space of the Garden itself was filled with
good representatives of the flora of the temperate regions, the collec-
tion of composite being especially important. In the absence of a suf-
ficient endowment, activity on the part of the director had to replace the
want of money, and he, utilizing the means at hand, succeeded in mak-
ing the Garden an exceedingly important means of exchange between
foreign establishments and our own botanists and collectors. Huropean
botanists who visited the Garden wondered how, from such a small and
ill-endowed establishment, so much had been done in aid of other insti-
tutions. The explanation lay in the skill and energy of Dr. Gray
himself.

Gray’s work as a teacher extended over a period of more than fifty
years, dating from the first lectures on botany at the Fairfield Medical
School, in 1831 and 1832, and the publication of his “ Klements of
Botany,” in 1836. During that period he trained up a whole race of
botanists, now scattered through all parts of the United States, so that
wherever he went he was greeted by those who rembered his instruc-
tion with pleasure. When at Santa Barbara in 1885, an elderly man,
who seemed to be about his own age, introduced himself as a former pupil
in his first class at Harvard. Asa college lecturer he was not seen at
his best, for his somewhat hesitating manner when he spoke extempora-
neously was unfavorably contrasted with the fervid, almost impetuous
utterance of Agassiz, and the clear exposition and dignified address of
Jeffries Wyman, his two great contemporaries at Harvard. In his public
addresses he always spoke from notes, and, especially in his later years,
his strikingly expressive face commanded the attention of his hearers
from the start. In the class-room he was personally much liked, and
he made a strong impression on the majority of students, although, in
the days when every student was forced to study botany, there were
of course some who would not have cared for the subject under any cir-
cumstances. The instruction, as was natural, bearing in mind his own
early training and the state of botany in this country at the time when
he became professor at Harvard, was confined mainly to the morpho-
logical study of flowering plants; for he recognized that, until some ad-
vance had been made in that direction, it was out of the question deal-
ing adequately with the more technically complicated subjects of his-
tology, embryology, and physiology.

For the instruetion which he was obliged to give, the resources of
the garden and the herbarium and the ordinary college lecture-rooms

__—

at first sufficed, but at last it became necessary to provide a special
laboratory and lecture-room at the garden. A liberal friend of Dr.
Gray and the college presented a sum of money for this purpose, and
in 1872 a wing was added to the herbarium. About this time the de-
mand for laboratory instruction and equipment increased rapidly, and
the new lecture-room and laboratory were soon found to be inadequate
to meet the needs of the increasing calls for microscopic and physio-
logical work, and they were at length abandoned. Itis not surprising
that Dr. Gray could not foresee how great the growth in this direction
was to be even in his own life. Probably no person of his age could
have foreseen it.

His herbarium was, at one period or another, the resort of nearly all
the active working botanists of the country, and thither came many
young men who were afterwards to aid in the development of botanical
studies in the United States. His intercourse with them was always
free and unrestrained by formalities of any kind, and he seemed more
like a learned friend than a teacher. Passing to and fro from his own
study to the herbarium he greeted all cordially, watching and criticising
sharply but good-naturedly the work that was going on. No one en-
enjoyed a hearty laugh more than he, and every now and then he would
brighten the work by some anecdote from the large stock which his re-
teutive memory ever had at hand; always however for the purpose of
emphasizing some point or illustrating some fact which he wished to
bring out more clearly, but never allowing the attention of those about
him to be distracted from their work. Life at the herbarium was in-
deed a pleasure, and the more serious work was well seasoned and
spiced in the days when the agile assistant, Charles Wright, skipped
about like a squirrel, his diminutive body in Cambridge, his larger mind
wandering away in his beloved Cuba and the Pacific islands,—when
Brewer, less continent than his teacher in the matter of anecdote, saw in
every plant before him some episode of his own life in camp. The ap-
proach of Dr. Gray, heralded by his cheery laugh, or perhaps by a
mild anathema against the gardener, who every morning, regardless of
the intentions of nature, deluged the cacti placed in the corridor, we all
understood to mean business, for, if joking was allowed, trifling was not.
We learned something about botanists as well as about botany, and
often wondered whether Robert Brown were really as great as he was
represented ; and, on the rare occasions of a visit from a man like Dr.
Torrey or Dr. Engelmann, we asked ourselves whether there was any
chance that the younger generation of botanists would bear any com-
parison with the older. None who have worked under Dr. Gray at the
herbarium will forget the deep personal interest he always manifested
in their work and future prospects. He always encouraged and stimu-
lated without holding out false hopes. To those who wished to devote
themselves to botany in the years still recent, when it was scarcely
possible for a botanist to live by botany alone, he used to say: “ Study
Ce BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

medicine, and if you then still want to be a botanist, go ahead. Your
medicine will keep your botany from starving.”

Great as was the direct influence of Dr. Gray upon the students with
whom he came in contact, his influence on the development of botany
in this country through the medium of his numerous text-books and
manuals was even more important. His first text-book, ‘‘ Elements of
Botany,” written when he was only twenty-six years old, shows many
of the best characteristics of bis later works, being written in a
smooth, graceful style, with the different topics clearly and methodically
arranged. The vigorous defense of the natural system of classifica-
tion, which now appears superfluous, indicates that the author of 1836
was a progressive young man, who had shaken off the conservatism
which prevailed among American botanists of that period. That he
was young and inexperienced is occasionally shown, as in the amusing
statement that “the herbarium of a diligent botanist will pass so fre-
quently under his observation that any very extensiveravages | by insects]
ean hardly take place without his being aware of it in time to check the
progress of the destroyers.” He evidently had no conception of how
large his own collection would become in a few years.

The “ Elements” of 1836 developed into the ‘“ Botanical Text-Book ”
of 1842, in which the portion relating to systematic botany was much
more fully treated than in the earlier volume. The latter editions,
which appeared at intervals until 1879, are familiar to every one, for
they have been the means of opening the world of botany to more than
one generation of American botanists. In 1868 the “ Lehrbuch der
Botanik,” by Sachs, appeared. That work was a genuine revelation,
showing the advance which had been made by experts in the science
of botany, and, although somewhat above the capacity of the common
student, it was destined to produce in a few years a revolution in the
method of botanical instruction.

Recognizing the new era which had opened in botany, Dr. Gray re-
vised the plan of the “ Text-Book,” with a view of bringing it into accord
with the more widely developed science of the day, and in 1879 issued
the first volume of the revised work, in which he included the Mor-
phology of Phenogams, Taxonomy, and Phytography, thus covering
the greater part of the ground of the original “ Text-Book,” intrusting
to his colleague, Professor Goodale, the volume on Physiological Bot-
any, (which appeared in 1885—a worthy companion of its predecessor, )
and to the writer the volume on Cryptogams. He hoped, but hardly
could have expected, to write a fourth volume, on the Orders of Phe-
nogamous Plants. It is deeply to be regretted that he was never able
to write this volume, for it would have enabled him to present the gen-
eral views on classification derived from a long and exceptionally rich
experience. No better text-book on the subject had ever been written
in the English language than Gray’s ‘‘Text-Book” in the original form ;
and, although botanical instruetion is now very different from what it

—a >
ASA GRAY. TH

used to be, it is still true that, as an introduction to the study of Phe-
nograms, the group to which beginners naturally turn their attention,
the later “Structural Botany,” is likely to hold its own for some time to
come. In 1887, just before he started on his last European journey, he
finished a small book giving in an abbreviated form the substance of
the Structural Botany, as well as some chapters on Cryptogams; and
for this, his latest text-book, he revived the title of his earliest work,
‘“‘Klements of Botany. ”

The “Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States,” of
which the first edition appeared in 1847, needs no words of praise here.
There are probably few members of the Academy who do not own, or
have not at some time owned, a copy of this model work. Occasionally
some overwise person has discovered that certain plants grow a few
inches taller or bloom a few days earlier than is stated in the ‘ Man-
ual”; but the botanist is yet to be born who could write a more clear,
accurate, aud compact account of the flora of any country. The only
regret is that he could not have written manuals for all parts of the
country.

Dr. Gray had the rare faculty of being able to adapt himself to all
classes of readers. With the scientific he was learned, to the student
he was instructive and suggestive, and he charmed the general reader
by the graceful beauty of his style, while to children he was simplicity
itself. The little books, *‘ How Plants Grow,” and ‘ How Plants Be-
have,” found their way where botany as botany could not have gained
an entrance, and they set in motion a current which moved in the gen-
eral direction of a higher science with a force which can hardly be esti-
mated. His scientific friends, especially those abroad, sometimes
blamed him for spending time in popular writing; but he may have
understood himself and his surroundings better than they. With him
botany was a pleasure as well asa business. Few wrote as easily as
he, and, so long as he spent most of his time in higher work, he cer-
tainly had aright to amuse himself with writings of a popular char-
acter if he chose. As it was, he interested a multitude of readers in
the subjects which he had at heart, and if he was not permitted to live
to see the completion of his greatest work, ‘‘The Synoptical Flora,” he
at least was able to leave the work at a point where it could be con-
tinued by a trusted friend in sympathy with all his plans.

As a reviewer he was certainly extraordinary. Someof his reviews
were in reality elaborate essays, in which, taking the work of another
as a text, he presented his own views on important topics in a masterly
manner. Others were technically critical, while some were simply
concise and very clear summaries of lengthy works. Taken collectively,
they show better than any other of his writings the literary excellence
of his style, as well as his great fertility and his fairness and acuteness as
a critic. Never unfair, never ill-natured, his sharp criticism, like the
774. BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

surgeon’s knife, aimed not to wound, but to cure; and if he sometimes
felt it his duty to be severe, he never failed to praise what was worthy.
The number of his reviews and notices written during his connection
with the American Journal of Science as editor and assistant editor for
over thirty years, and for the North American Review, the Nation, the
Atlantic Monthly, and numerous other journals, is enormous, and it
almost seems as if he must have written notices of the greater part of all
the botanical works he had ever read. Those intimately acquainted
with him more than half believed that he was able to write good notices
of books written in languages which he could not read. He was able,
as if by instinct, to catch the spirit and essence of what he read, without
any exertion on his part. One who wrote so much might have become
monotonous. But he was never prosy, and his style was so easy and
flowing, and so constantly enlivened by sprightly allusions and pleasing
metaphors, that one could read what he wrote for the mere pleasure of
the reading. His was one of the rare cases where Science had appro-
priated to herself one who would have been an ornament to any purely
literary profession.

It would be presumption were we to express an opinion on the posi-
tion of Gray as a scientific botanist. Fortunately for us, it is unnec-
essary. The greatest living systematic botanist, Sir J. D. Hooker, the
one by his attainments and position fitted above all others to speak
with authority on the subject, has already recorded his opinion in the
following words:

When the history of the progress of botany during the nineteenth
century shall be written, two names will hold high positions: those of
Prof. Augustin Pyrame De Candolle and of Prof. Asa Gray. - - -
Kach devoted half a century of unremitting labor to the investigation
and description of the plants of continental areas, and they founded
herbaria and libraries, each in his own country, which have become per-
manent and quasi-national institutions. - - - There is much in
their lives and works that recails the career of Linneus, of whom they
were worthy disciples, in the comprehensiveness of their labor, the ex-
cellence of their methods, their judicious conception of the limits of
genera and species, the terseness and accuracy of their descriptions,
and the clearness of their scientific language.

The accuracy of the resemblance of Gray and De Candolle, so admi-
rabiy and justly expressed by Hooker, will be recognized by all botan-
ists. Gray was the De Candolle of America, whose mission it was to
bring together the scattered and crude works of the earlier explorers
and botanists and the vast unwrought material of his own day, and to
combine them with his surpassing skill into one grand comprehensive
work which should fitly describe the flora of a continent. But while
recognizing the resemblance between De Candolle and Gray in their
mode of work and the purpose for which they strove, we can only mar-
vel how it was possible for a poor farmer’s boy in America, without a
university education, to become the peer of one of Europe’s best trained
botanists.
ASA GRAY. 775

From his training and early surroundings we might have expected
him to be energetic and original, but we should not have expected to
find him highly polished and cultured. His associates at Fairfield and
Clinton were persons of scientific tastes, and, even if their attainments
were not of the highest quality, they encouraged his fondness for nat-
ural history. But it is not easy to see how he obtained the literary
training which enabled him to write with the ease and elegance found
even in his earlier works, for although aman may by nature be a good ob-
server of natural objects, a finished style comes only with training and
experience. From his teacher, Avery, he could not have received much
in the way of training; for Dr. Gray himself says that he did not give
him the sharp drilling and testing which was needed. His residence
with the Torrey family in New York first placed him in a society where
literary excellence as well as scientific knowledge was prized ; and while
he profited by the accuracy and strict scientific methods of Dr. Torrey,
then the foremost American botanist, the frequent conversations and
kindly criticism of Mrs. Torrey made good many of the literary defi-
ciencies of his early training. He was also aided while in New York by
the criticisms and suggestions made on some of his earlier manuscripts
by the cultured botanist, Mr. John Carey. But he must have been an
apt pupil, for, while still with Dr. Torrey, he showed that in point of
clearness and accuracy he was not much inferior to his highly respected
teacher, and in the second volume of the ‘‘Flora” he proved himself to
be quite his equal.

The plan of the “ Flora of North America” originated with Dr. Torrey;
but when his pupil went to Cambridge to assume the duties of his new
position, neither of them suspected the magnitude of the task which
they had undertaken, nor the modifications which the plan must ulti-
mately undergo. The pupil was now in a more fortunate position than
his teacher, for Gray was henceforth able to devote himself to his fa-
vorite science, while Dr. Torrey could only employ his leisure hours in
botany. The two volumes of the original Torrey and Gray ‘“ Flora”
will always remain a memorial of the unbroken friendship of America’s
two greatest botanists, alike in the spirit which animated their work
and in the reverent simplicity of their characters.

The greater part of Gray’s scientific work during the thirty-five years
following the completion of the second volume of Torrey and Gray’s
“ Wlora,” in 1843, had a more or less direct bearing on the contemplated
revision and enlargement of that work. Besides the papers printed in
the Academy’s publications, he wrote a very large number of mono-
graphs and notes on points connected with the determination and de-
scription of new and doubtful species. They are scattered through the
proceedings of different learned societies, and the columns of the Amer-
ican Journal of Science, the Torrey Bulletin, Botanical Gazette, the
Naturalist, and other American as well as European journals. One
of his most important works was ‘Genera Flores Americ Boreali-
776 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

Orientalis [lustrata” (1545-49), in which he intended to figure and
describe all the genera of the Kastern States, with the aid of the artist,
Mr. Isaac Sprague. Of this work only two of the proposed volumes
were ever published, owing to the expense entailed. Other important
papers were “ Plants Wrightianze Texano-Neo-Mexicane,” in the Smith-
sonian contributions of 1852 and 1853; ‘Plante Lindheimeriane,”
written in connection with Dr. Engelmann; ‘Reports on the Botany of
the 32d, 38th, 39th, and 41st Parallel Expeditions,” in connection with
Dr. Torrey ; Gamopetale in Watsow’s Flora of California, ete. An ex-
amination of the complete list of his works, which will soon be printed
in the American Journal of Science, would alone convey an adequate
idea of his extraordinary fertility as a writer and the wide range of his
investigations.

After this long preparation of thirty-five years, the first part of the
“ Synoptical Flora,” including the Gamopetale after Composite, ap-
peared, in 1878. It formed the first part of the second volume; for, on
the revised plan, the first volume was to include the Polypetale and
Gamopetale through Composite, and the second volume the remaining
Exogens and the Endogens. <A second part, including from Caprifoli-
acee through Composite, appeared in 1884, and in 1886 supplements to
both parts were issued, and the whole bound in one volume. He was at
work on the Polypetale, and had nearly finished the Vitacee, when
attacked by his last illness, aud the unfinished volumes must now be
completed by him who was his associate for many years, and, after Dr.
Gray himself, the best fitted for the work.

Gray’s critical knowledge of the Flora of North America not only
placed him at the head of all American botanists, but also gave him a
high reputation abroad. In his knowledge of the difficult order Com-
posite, the largest of all the orders of flowering plants, and the one in
which he always felt the most interest, he probably surpassed any liv-
ing botanist. He was at one time urged by Bentham and Hooker to
treat that order in their classic “ Genera Plantarum,” but, as the work
involved a residence at Kew for a considerable time, he was obliged to
decline the offer.

It was however more especially through his observations on the
geographical distribution of plants made incidentally during the prog-
ress of his work on our own flora, that he was recognized as a natu-
ralist of the highest type by the scientific circles of Europe. When
we consider the marked capacity for studies of this nature which he
afterwards exhibited, remembering the brilliant contributions to Plant
Geography which resulted from the explorations of Robert Brown,
Darwin, and Hooker, we can only regret that Gray did not sail as
botanist of the Wilkes Expedition. The collectors of the expedition,
Dr. Charles Pickering, W. D. Brackenridge, and William Rich, brought
back many interesting plants, of which the Phwenogams, excepting those
from the Pacific coast of America sent to Dr. Torrey, were placed in

his hands for description. But Gray would have been more than a col-
lector. He would have brought back impressions, and, recalling the
charming narrative of the illustrious naturalist of the Beagle, we can
imagine the pleasure with which we should have read the journal of a
botanist, written with the delicate humor and the keen appreciation of
the beautiful and curious in nature which Asa Gray possessed.

The study of the Wilkes plants, in which he was aided by Bentham’s
large experience, gracefully acknowledged in his Memorial of Bentham
in the American Journal of Science of February, 1885, introduced him
to an exotic flora of largerange. The work appeared in 1854 as a quarto
volume of nearly eight hundred pages, with an atlas of a hundred folio
plates.

His first paper* on the distribution of plants appeared in the Ameri-
can Journal of Science of September, 1856, and was followed by two
other parts the next year. It bore the title of “Statistics of the Flora
of the northern United States,” and was prepared at the time he was at
work on a second edition of the ‘‘Manual,” partly in response to a re-
quest from Darwin for a list of American alpine plants. In this paper
he gave a general view of the characteristics of the North American
flora, with tables of species showing the extension of alpine plants and
the comparative distribution of Eastern and Western species, and their
relation to species of Europe and Asia, although he states that he must
defer making an extended comparison with the plants of northeastern
Asia until he has studied some recent collections from the northern
part of Japan. The most important conclusions reached in this paper
may be stated in his own words: ‘All our strictly subalpine species
(with two exceptions), which are common to us and to Europe, extend
northward along the central region of the continent quite to the arctic
sea-coast, while curiously enough eleven, or one-third of our strictly
alpine species common to Europe—all but one of them arctic in the
Old World—are not known to cross the arctic circle on this continent.
This, however, might perhaps have been expected, as it seems almost
certain that the interchange of alpine spécies between us and Europe
must have taken place in the direction of Newfoundland, Labrador, and
Greenland rather than through the polar regions.” Again: “The
special resemblance of our flora to that of Europe, it is clear, is not
owing simply either to the large proportion of genera in common, or
to anything striking or important in the few genera, nearly or quite
peculiar to the two. The latter, indeed, are insignificant in our flora
and not to be compared, as to any features they impart, with the much
more numerous and really characteristic genera which are shared by
the eastern United States and eastern temperate Asia. We must

* In the paper ‘‘ On the Botany of Japan,” p. 442, Gray speaks of a paper on the dis-
tribution of plants in the American Journal of Science of an earlier date than the one
here mentioned, apparently the review of Siebold’s Flora Japonica, l. ¢. June 1840,
XXXIX, 175.

look for it in the species, partly in the identical ones and partly in
those which closely answer to each other in the two floras.” He accounts
for such cases as the occurrence of Phryma leptostachya in the United
States and Nepal as follows: ‘* We should therefore look in one and the
same direction for the explanation of these extraordinary no less than
of the more ordinary cases of distribution, and should - - - refer
such anomalous distribution to very ancient dispersion.”

The plants from Japan to which he referred were collected by
Charles Wright, botanist of the North Pacific Exploring Expedition,
known as the Ringgold and Rodgers Expedition, of which Dr. Gray gave
an account in a paper ‘On the Botany of Japan, and its Relations to
that of North America and of other Parts of the Northern Temperate
Zone,” presented to this academy December 14, 1858, and January 11,
1859, and published April 25, 1859, in the sixth volume of the Memoirs.
This memoir raised his reputation to its highest point among scientific
men, and, appealing again to the authority of Sir J. D. Hooker, “in point
of originality and far-reaching results was its author’s opus magnum.”
In referring to his previous paper in the American Journal, he states,
with great candor, that, from the facts there brought out, (1) that a
large percentage of our extra-European types are shared with eastern
Asia, and (2) that no small part of them are unknown in western North
America.” Mr. Bentham was the first to state the natural conclusion
that the interchange between the temperate floras even of the western
part of the Old World and of the New has mainly taken place via Asia.
He cites Bentham’s suggestion of a continuity of territory between
America and Asia “under a latitude, or at any rate with a climate, more
meridional than would be effected by a junction through the chains of
the Aleutian and the Kurile Islands.” He then proceeds to show why
a connection in a more meridional latitude need not be assumed; and,
fortified by the wide geological knowledge of his friend, Prof. J. D. Dana,
he gives a masterly account of the relations of the floras of the north
temperate regions from the Cretaceous period to the present time, ac-
counting for the present distribution by migrations of species from the
arctic regions due principally to the different climatic conditions of the
pre-glacial, glacial, and post-glacial eras. The relations of the floras of
eastern America and eastern Asia was a favorite topic with him, and
he often spoke on the subject in public; his two most important ad-
dresses in which he referred to plant distribution being that on “Sequoia
and its History,” delivered as retiring president of the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science, in 1872, and a lecture on “ Forest
Geography and Archeology,” read before the Harvard Natural History
Society in 1878, and afterwards translated in the Annales des Sciences.

The study of plant distribution necessarily involved the question of
the origin of species, and this brings us to a consideration of the rela-
tions of Gray to Darwin and Darwinism. Gray first met Darwin at
Westbank, the residence of Sir W. J. Hooker, at Kew, in 1851; and their
ASA GRAY. 7179

correspondence dates from a letter of Darwin, written April 25, 1855,
asking for information about the alpine plants of the United States.
How intimate and frequent their correspondence became, and how
deeply each was interested in the work of the other is admirably shown in
the “Life and Letters of Charles Darwin.” The published letters pre-
sent a vivid picture of the inner scientific life of these two men, both
equally simple, earnest, remarkably free from prejudice, and anxious to
do justice to the work of others. Many of the problems upon which
Darwin was at work were those in which Gray was most interested;
and he was often able to aid Darwin by his observations, and still more
by his judicious and always acceptable criticisms. While the naturalist
at Down was absorbed in the study of climbing plants and ecross-fertili-
zation, the greenhouses at Cambridge were also used as nurseries for
the growth of climbers and the odd, irregularly flowered plants which
ought to be cross-fertilized. The writer recalls the time when Dr. Gray
hardly ever passed in or out of the herbarium without stroking—patting
on the the back by way of encouraging them it almost seemed—the
tendrils of the climbers on the walls and porch; and when, on the an-
nouncement that a student had discovered another new case of cross-
fertilization in the garden, he would rush out bareheaded and breathless,
like a school-boy, to see the thing with his own critical eyes.

Darwin, in a letter dated June 20, 1856, confided to Gray that he
had “come to the heterodox conclusion that there are no such things
as independently created species,—that species are only strongly de-
fined varieties.” In this letter he alsosays: ‘I assume that species arise
like our domestic varieties with much extinction.” About a year after
this (September 5, 1857) Darwin wrote to Gray the now famous letter,
in which be propounded the law of the evolution of species by means of
natural selection; and it was this letter, read at the Linnean Society
July 1, 1858, on the occasion of the presentation of the joint paper of
Darwin and Wallace ‘‘On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties;
and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of
Selection,” which fixed the date of the priority of the great discovery
as due to Darwin. What were Gray’s own views on the subject of
evolution previous to the publication of the “Origin of Species,” in
November, 1859, may perhaps be inferred from some remarks which he
made on January 11, 1859, when he presented his paper ‘On the
Botany of Japan” to this academy. He then stated that “the idea of
the descent of all similar or conspecific individuals from a common
stock is so natural, and so inevitably suggested by common observa-
tion, that it must needs be first tried upon the problem (of distribution],
and if the trial be satisfactory its adoption would follow as a matter of
course.” In brief, he was inclined to accept evolution, but wished more
proof; and nearly three years earlier, in a letter to Professor Dana,
written December 13, 1856, he had well expressed his own attitude by
saying, “‘L have as yet no opinion whatever, and no very strong bias.”
780 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS.

He saw what was coming however, and in a later letter to Professor
Dana, anticipating the publication of the ** Origin of Species,” he says,
‘‘You may be sure that before long there must be one more resurrection
of the development theory in a new form, obviating many of the argu-
ments against it, and presenting a more respectable and more formida-
ble appearance than it ever has before.”

Gray was one of the favored three, including Hooker and Lyell, to
whom Darwin sent advance sheets of the “ Origin of Species” prior to
its publication in November, 1859; and of his review in the American
Journal of Science of the following March, Darwin wrote, “Your re-
view seems to me admirable,—by far the best I have read.” The re-
view certainly presents most accurately, succinctly, and attractively
Darwin’s own views; but Gray does not even here announce that he
is himself a complete convert to the doctrine, as is seen by the follow-
ing citation: “What would happen if the derivation of species were to
be substantiated, either as a true physical theory or as a sufficient
hypothesis? The inquiry is a pertinent one just now. For, of those
who agree with us in thinking that Darwin has not established his
theory of derivation, many will admit with us that he has rendered a
theory of derivation much less improbable than before; that such a
theory chimes in with the established doctrines of physical science, and
is not unlikely to be largely accepted long before it can be proved.”
And the similar statement in the Atlantic Monthly of October, 1860:
‘“‘ Those, if any there be, who regard the derivative hypothesis as satis-
factorily proved must have loose notions of what proof is. Those who
imagine it can be easily refuted and cast aside must, we think, have
imperfect or very prejudiced conceptions of the facts concerned and of
the questions at issue.”

In 1876 he brought together in a volume, entitled ‘ Darwiniana,” his
principal essays and reviews pertaining to Darwinism, taken from the
American Journal of Science, the Nation, and the Atlantic Monthly,
and added a chapter on “ Evolutionary Teleology ;” and in 1880 he
published “‘ Natural Science and Religion,” two lectures delivered to
the Theological School of Yale College, before a critical audience, who
listened with the deepest interest to what was, in some points, his
most advanced view of natural selection. We need not dwell ona
subject about which so much has lately been written by far abler pens
than ours. Briefly stated, Gray was probably the best expounder of
Darwinian principles—meaning thereby those actually advocated by
Darwin himself, and excluding the wild deductions attached to the
original theory by those who deserve the name of Darwinissimists
rather than Darwinists—although he himself regarded natural selec-
tion as a less efficient cause than it was assumed to be by Darwin.

His influence as an exponent of Darwinism was due partly to the
admirable clearness and candor of his reviews and his interesting way
of putting things; for his fertile imagination was constantly discovering
ASA GRAY. 781

aptsimiles toillustrate otherwise dry arguments. It wasalso duein part
to his known caution and conservatism, and his professed Christian faith.
If an avowed accepter “of the creed commonly called the Nicene” saw
nothing in Darwinism which implied atheism, or was opposed to the idea
of design on the part of the Creator, surely one might, at least, listen
to his account of his development theory with safety. To his hearers
at New Haven, in 1880, he said: ‘Natural selection by itself is not an
hypothesis, nor evena theory. Itis a truth—a catena of facts and di-
rect inferences from facts. - - - There is no doubt that natural se-
lection operates ; the open question is, what do its operations amount to.
The hypothesis based on this principle is, that the struggle for life and
survival of only the fittest among individuals, all disposed to vary and
no two exactly alike, will account for the diversification of the species
and forms of vegetable and animal life, will even account for the rise,
in the course of countless ages, from simpler and lower to higher and
more specialized living beings.” He gave it as his opinion that natural
selection is, on the whole, a good working hypothesis, but does not ex-
plain how wholly new parts are initiated, even if the new organs are
developed little by little. He repeated over and over again in differ-
ent reviews his belief that natural selection could not account for varia-
tion, and he stated the case particularly forcibly in his ‘‘ Evolutionary
Teleology:” ‘Natural selection is not the wind which propels the
vessel, but the rudder, which, by friction, now on this side and now
on that, shapes the course. The rudder acts while the vessel is in
motion, effects nothing when it is at rest. Variation answers to the
wind. - - - Its course is controlled by natural selection. This pro-
ceeds mainly through outward influences. But we are more and more
convinced that variation - - - is not a product of, but a response
to, the action of the environment. Variations are evidently not from
without, but from within.”

But how do variations arise? According to Gray, by virtue of some
inherent power imparted in the beginning by Divine agency. That
granted, natural selection would in great part account for the present
condition and distribution of life, so that one could be a Darwinian and
Deist at the same time. Gray further believed that variation is apt
to follow in certain more or less regular directions, and particularly in
beneficial directions. Here he differed very widely from Darwin. The
one saw design where the other could not, and it must be confessed
that Gray was treading on delicate ground, scientifically if not theo-
logically speaking, when he affirmed the direction of variation in bene-
ficial lines. For what is meant by beneficial? Beneficial to whom?
Beneficial for what purpose? In one sense, any variation which tends
to enable a living being to survive in the struggle for existence is bene-
ficial; and to say that any being or structure has survived is the same
as saying that the variation from which it sprang was beneficial, But
182 BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIRS,

Gray apparently uses the word beneficial in the sense of being fore-
ordained to be beneficial.

Perhaps we must look to inheritance itself for an explanation of the
difference in the views of Gray and Darwin. The Gray family were
devout members of the Presbyterian Church, and throughout his life
Dr. Gray adhered faithfully to the orthodox faith of his fathers, his
own views being in harmony with those of the liberal branch rather
than with those of the conservative branch of that communion. The
agnostic position of Darwin may perhaps be inferred from his own de-
scription of himself and his father as belonging “nominally to |the]
Church of England,” an expression which leads one to believe that he
was hardly to be counted a member of that or any other denomination.
When a young man, Gray certainly had no leanings towards evolution.
In his review of the “ Vestiges of Creation,” in the North American
Review of 1846, he wrote: ‘‘ Although ‘ geology fully proves’ that
there have been various creations, that different species were created
at different periods, and that some of the humblest and simplest first
appeared, while land animals, quadrupeds, quadrumana, and bimana
were not introduced until after the earth was fitted for their residence,
yet we are still to be convinced that they were not then created as per-
fect as they now are.” But he was convinced later, when he studied
the relations of the North American flora to that of Asia, and he ac-
cepted without hesitation the view that the present species are not
special creations, but derived from previously existing species, at atime
when the truth of the theory was scarcely recognized by any naturalists,
and at a date when in the public mind a belief in evolution meant athe-
ism. He had the courage to avow openly his convictions, but, on the
other hand, never allowed his convictions to be governed by wild
speculations. ;

But we who have known Asa Gray so many years would now reeall,
not the great botanist, but rather the kind-hearted, genial man, whose
sympathy cheered and whose wisdom guided, whose heart was ever
young, whose brain was ever active. His long life, unclouded by great
sorrow and almost free from personal enmities, was inspired throughout
by a faith which never faltered. Retaining to the last the energy and
vivacity of youth, his intellect broadening and ripening, his character
growing more and more sweet and serene, he reminds us of one of those
trees which bear flowers and fruit at the same time. Industrious to an
extent that few could equal, his work done, he enjoyed society with a
relish, and his realy wit, his inexhaustible stock of anecdotes, and his
quick and keen appreciation of the best in literature and art, made him
everywhere welcome. His own house was open to all, and even those
who came to pay the simple tribute of staring were not often turned
away. With a graceful hospitality to which wealth could have lent no
greater charm, he entertained the learned of many nations, and wel-
comed with special cordiality his brother botanists, a long array, includ-
ASA GRAY. 783

ing not only the experts in the science, but the poor and struggling
student as well. He shared with all, the treasures of his knowledge,
and not infrequently he added something from the modest competence
which his industry had amassed. The words of good cheer from his
lips were re-echoed in after years, and the life so honorable was not un-
honored. If the numerous honorary degrees from learned societies at
home and abroad testify to the esteem in which he was held as a scien-
tific botanist, the warm congratulations of friends from all parts of the
country when the memorial vase was presented on his seventy-fifth
birthday show no less clearly how much he was beloved as a man,
And when, during dreary weeks, his anxious friends hoped against
hope, watching to catch the sound of the loved voice which would
speak but could not, all felt that the message which he sought to utter
must have been a benediction. But it was not needed. His life was a
benediction, and as his body was borne to its last resting place the
freshly-fallen snow was not more pure than his character, nor the
sparkling winter air more bright and clear than his intellect.
