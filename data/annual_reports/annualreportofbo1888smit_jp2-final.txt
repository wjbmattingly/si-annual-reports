JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, January 11, 1888.

The stated annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithso-
nian Institution was held this day at 10:30 o’clock A. M.

Present: Chief-Justice M. R. WArrsE, Chancellor of the Institution,
Hon. 8. 8S. Cox, Hon. W. W. PHELPS, Hon. JOSEPH WHEELER, Dr.
HENRY CopPEE, Dr. J. B. ANGELL, Dr. J. C. WELLING, General M.
C. MEIGS, and the Secretary, Professor LANGLEY.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. NoAH PORTER and
Senator J. S. MoRRILL. The Secretary made a statement that the ab-
sence of Dr. ASA GRAY was caused by his severe illness.

The journal of the proceedings of the Board at the meetings on Janu-
ary 12 and November 18, 1887, was read and approved.

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the instructions of the
Board at the last meeting, he had again consulted with the widow of
the late Professor BAIRD, and ascertained that while she desired to
defer to the wishes of the Regents, her own preference would be that
the interment of the remains of her husband should be strictly private.
It was necessary therefore to depart from the arrangements which had
been contemplated at the last meeting of the Board, and by the advice
of the Executive Committee, a meeting of the Board of Regents was not
called as had been anticipated in December, and the stated annual
meeting is therefore now held at the regular time, as provided by the
regulations of the Board of Regents.

The Chancellor announced the appointment by the President of the
Senate, on December 19, 1887, of Hon. Randall L. Gibson, of Louisiana,
as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, vice Senator Maxey, whose
term had expired.

The Chancellor also announced the appointment by the Speaker of
the House of Representatives, on January 5, 1888, of Hon. S. S. Cox,
of New York, as regent, vice Hon. O. R. Singleton, who had not been
re-elected to Congress; and on the 10th of January, of Hon. Joseph
Wheeler, of Alabama, vice Hon. W. L. Wilson, and the re-appointment
of Hon. W. W. Phelps, of New Jersey.

Dr. Welling, chairman of the Executive Committee, presented its an-
nual report for the year ending June 30, 1887.
Dr. Welling, in presenting the report, called attention to # paragraph
on the third page, relative to the appropriation for ‘ethnological re-
XI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

searches,” and he wished it understood—not as a matter of criticism, but
in explanation—that the Executive Committee made no examination
or inspection of the accounts of the Bureau of Ethnology. These were
exclusively under the control—according to the acts of Congress mak-
ing the appropriations—“ of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion.” In this respect a difference existed between the duty of the com-
mittee in regard to these accounts and those of the Museum or of other
trusts committed to the Institution, of which careful examination was
made of every voucher.

The Secretary stated that he would be very willing to be relieved of
this weighty responsibility and would be gratified if it could be assumed
by the Regents. He had no desire to assume a personal responsibility
in regard to the appropriation referred to, and he hoped that in the
future it might be found possible to make the appropriations to the
“ Smithsonian Institution” instead of to the ‘ Secretary.”

Dr. Welling remarked that the Executive Committee does not care to
share this responsibility.

Dr. Coppée said he thought it the duty of the Regents to share in
this; and that if the language of the act was doubtful, and if in relation
to one trust it was the duty of the Secretary to confer with the Execu-
tive Committee, he thought that in others, although the Regents or the
Institution were not specially mentioned, he ought to come under the
Same arrangement.

General Meigs said that Congress made the distinction referred to by
Dr. Welling, and it was not for the Board to advise or dictate to Con-
gress,

[This view was assented to by various members of the Board.]

The Secretary having stated that the accounts of the Museum were
settled by the Interior Department, and that the estimates for preserva-
tion, ete., of the collections were sent by him through the Secretary of
the Interior to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chancellor remarked
that he thought that all the accounts of the Institution in regard to
any operations committed to it, should be settled directly with the
Treasury Department, and not through an intermediate department.

The Secretary said that the Chancellor had anticipated what he was
about to say. As the Executive Committee had observed, the relations
of the Museum with the Department of the Interior on the one hand
and with the Regents on the other, are undoubtedly ambiguous, since
the late Secretary of the Interior himself wrote to say that he did not
understand them. At present the Secretary of the Institution transmits
the estimates for the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, but does not transmit those of the Museum, which are sent through
the Secretary of the Interior. It would seem desirable that some ar- -
rangement should be made by which.in the future all the estimates
should be submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, and all appro-
priations for the Museum, as well as for the Bureau of Ethnology, made
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIII

to the Smithsonian Institution, and that the sundry eivil bill should be
changed in the items relating to the Museum and the Bureau of Eth-
nology.

The Chancellor expressed the opinion that all the appropriations
ought to be disbursed and controlled by the Institution.

After remarks by several of the Regents, on motion of Dr. Welling,
the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Regents recommend to Congress that the form of
the sundry civil appropriation bill be so changed in the items relating
to the Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology as to provide,

First, That these moneys shall be disbursed under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution.

Second, That the estimates for the appropriations of the Museum in
future shall be sent direct to the Secretary of the Treasury by the
Smithsonian Institution through its Secretary.

On motion, it was resolved that the report of the Executive Committee
be accepted.

The Secretary presented the annual report for the year ending June
40, 1887, which had been printed; but he regretted to say that he had
not been able to procure copies from the Public Printer in December, iu
accordance with the resolutions of the Board.

The Chancellor suggested that some action ought to be taken by Con-
gress to avoid delay in printing the annuai reports of the Institution.
He thought provision might be made by law for the printing of the
Smithsonian Institution outside of the Government Printing Office, as is
done in the case of the printing for the Supreme Court. The attention
of the Congressional Regents was especially called to this subject.

The Secretary stated that a large amount of indispensable printing
was now done through the Department of the Interior, and some pro-
vision ought to be made for this if the connection of the Museum with
the Department should cease. He hoped that the Congressional Re-
gents would take some action in this matter.

On motion of Mr. Cox, it was resolved that the report of the Secre-
tary for the year ending June 30, 1887, be accepted, and that the See-
retary transmit the same to Congress.

The Chancellor announced that on December 2, 1887, in accordance
with the statute, he had appointed Mr. G. Brown Goode to act as Act-
ing Secretary in case of the absence or disability of the Secretary.

The Secretary called the attention of the Board to a bill introduced in
the Senate by Senator Edmunds on the 12th of December, as follows :

A BILL to provide for paying the widow of the late Spencer F. Baird for the services
rendered by him as Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the ‘Lreas-
ury De, and he is hereby, directed to pay Mrs. Mary ©. Baird, widow of
the late Spencer I’. Baird, the sum of fifty thousand dollars, out of any
money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, in full compensation
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

for the services and expenses of the said Spencer F. Baird during his
administration of the office of Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, from
February twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and seventy-one, to the time
of his death in August, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven.

The Secretary also called attention to the fact that Senator Morrill
bad introduced a bill in the Senate on the 12th of December, 1887, as
follows:

A BILL for the erection of a bronze statue of Spencer F. Baird, late Secretary of the
Smithsonian Jnstitution.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution be, and are hereby, authorized to contract for a statue
in bronze of Spencer F. Baird, late Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, to be erected upon the grounds in front of the National Museum ;
and for this purpose, and for the entire expense of the foundation and
pedestal of the monument, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, or so
much of said sum as may be needed, is hereby appropriated, out of any
moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.

On motion of Mr. Phelps it was resolved that the Executive Commit-
tee and the Secretary be authorized to act for the Board of Regents
in case of the passage of any act of Congress relative to the erection of
a statue of Professor Baird.

The Secretary stated that he had but one more matter to which to
call the attention of the Board; it was brief, but of considerable im-
portance.

It may be remembered that several years ago the Secretary of the In-
stitution, Professor Baird, called the attention of the Regents to a bill
utroduced in the House of Representatives as follows, viz:

“For the erection of a fire-proof building on the south portion of the Smithsonian
Reservation for the accommodation of the U. 8. Geological Survey, and for other
purposes.

“« Beit enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the sum of two hundred
thousand dollars be, and hereby is, appropriated out of any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the erection of a fire-proof
building on the south portion of the Smithsonian Reservation for the
accommodation of the U.S. Geological Survey, and for other purposes:
Provided, That the consent of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
be first obtained thereto, and that the building be under their direction
when completed: And provided further, That the building be erected by
the Architect of the Capitol in accordance with plans approved by the
Director of the United States Geological Survey, the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, and the Architect of the Capitol, acting as a
board therefor.

‘“Atter a very full expression by the Regents in favor of immediate
action, on motion of General Sherman, it was

‘‘Kesolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
recommend to Congress to enlarge the National Museum, so as properly
to exhibit the mineral, geological, and other collections already on
hand and increasing each year, by the erection of a fire-proof building

on the southwest corner of the Smithsonian Reservation, similar in
style to the present National Museum, and they request an appropriation
of $300,000 therefor, to be expended under the direction of the Regents
of the Institution.” *

The Secretary remarked that the placing of the offices of the Geologi-
eal Survey upon land heretofore reserved exclusively for Smithsonian
purposes might be perhaps considered as committing the Institution
toward the policy of a union with other scientific bureaus of the Gov-
ernment. It was in view of the questions of general policy thus involved,
that it seemed proper that he should ask instruction from the Regents.
He could only infer their opinion on the former bill from the language
of the resolution, which apparently implied,

First. That increased provision was desirable for the Museum col-
lections.

Second. From its silence as to the Geological Survey, that the building
proposed in the bill was not to be appropriated to that use.

The Secretary had lately been informally advised that it was the desire
of the Geological Survey to obtain his opinion with reference to this, in
anticipation of a bill to be brought before the present Congress, and he
desired to be favored with the jadgment of the Regents.

The Chancellor stated that it was desirable that new Museum build-
ings should be erected in any case, but that since by act of Congress
a certain part of the public grounds had been set apart and appropri-
ated absolutely and exclusively to the Smithsonian Institution, he for
one did not want to see anything else placed on these grounds. He
further said: ‘If the Smithsonian Institution is to grow it will need
them all, and whatever is put upon them should be under our exelu-
sive eral 4

After remarks by a number of Regents, ¢ expressing concurrence in
the views of the Chancellor, it was suggested by Mr. Phelps that the
unabpimous opinion of the Board ought to be embodied in a resolution.

The Chancellor did not think this was necessary. He supposed all
the Secretary wanted was the moral support of the Board in a policy
which would forbid the placing of any building on the Smithsonian
grounds except for the exclusive use of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Secretary alluded to another bill, which proposed to occupy part
of the public grounds, including the Smithsonian reservation, with
buildings for the Columbian celebration in 1892. ~ It was here remarked
by a Regent that there was no danger of this being done immediately,
to which the Chancellor said, ‘‘ With my consent, never.”

On motion of Dr. Angell, it was resolved that the income of the Insti-
tution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1888, and ending June 30,
1889, be appropriated for the service of ae Institution, to be expended
by the Secretary, with the advice of the Executive Committee, ys the

basis of the operations described in the last annual report of said com-
mittee, with full discretion on the part of the Secretary as to items of
expenditures properly falling under each of the heads embraced in the
established conduct of the Institution.

The Chancellor informed the Board that he had the melancholy duty
to perform of announcing the death, yesterday, of Dr. PETER PARKER,
who bad been for many years a Regent of the Institution and chairman
of its Executive Committee.

On motion of Dr. Angell, it was resolved that the Executive Commit-
tee prepare resolutions relative to the death of Dr. Parker.

Dr. Welling, of the Executive Committee, presented the following
resolutions, which were adopted :

Whereas the Board has received the afflictive intelligence that the
venerable Dr. PETER PARKER, who, for sixteen years, was a member of
the Board of Regents, and who for this whole period served with fidelity
on its Executive Committee, has departed this life after a long career
filled with useful labors in the service of God and of man: Therefore,
be it

Resolved, That in the retrospect of such a life-career, protracted as it
was beyond the limits usually allotted to men, and yet at each stage of
its progress dedicated to beneficent works in the cause of religion,
philanthropy, and science, we desire to testify our respect for the exalted
worth and scrupulous conscientiousness which Dr. Parker brought to
the discharge of every duty, and which, during his connection with the
government of this Institution, were nobly exemplified by the zeal and
diligence with which he ever watched and worked for its prosperity
aud usefulness, even during the later period of his honorable service,
when the burden of years was added to the burden of his official cares,
and when with a less conscientious sense of public duty he might
have claimed an exemption from the tasks of life.

Resolved, That since the retirement of our departed colleague from the
membership of this Board we have continued to follow him with the
grateful recollections inspired by the association of this council cham-
ber, as well as with a reverent respect for the Christian patience with
which he bore the intirmities of advancing age and the unfaltering
Christian hope with which he awaited “the inevitable hour” in fuil
assurance of immortality.

Kesolved, That these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of the
Board, and that the Secretary of the Institution is hereby requested to
transmit a copy of them to the family of our late colleague.

On motion, the Board then adjourned sine die.
SPECIAL MEETING OF THE REGENTS.

WASHINGTON, March 27, 1888.

A special meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day at 11
o’clock A. M.

Present, Hon. J. J. INGALLS (President of the United States Senate
pro tem.); Hon. SAMUEL F. MILLER (acting Chief Justice of the United
States); Hon. J.S. MorritL, Hon. 8S. M. CuLLom, Hon. 8. S. Cox,
Hon. JOSEPH WHEELER, Hon. WILLIAM W. PHELPS, Dr. JAMES C.
WELLING, General M. C. MEIGS, and the Secretary, Prof. 8S. P. LANG-
LEY.

The Secretary called the Board to order.

On motion of Senator Morrill, Hon. J. J. Ingalls was elected Chair-
man.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. PORTER, Dr. COPPEE,
Dr. ANGELL, and Dr. WHITE.

The Secretary stated that this special meeting had been called at the
request of three of the Regents as provided in the organic act. There
were two subjects requiring consideration: First, the recent death of
the Chancellor of the Institution, Chief Justice Waite; second, the elec-
tion of a Chancellor.

Professor Langley remarked that it would be for others who had
known the late Chancellor longer than he had to speak of his worth and
public services. He could only say that Judge Waite was not only a
tower of strength to the Institution; he was much more; he had the
regard, the respect, and the reverence of all those who were brought into
relation with him. He could only speak of him with the real affection
he felt, and say that the loss the Institution had experienced was to
him that of a dear and revered personal friend.

On the second point, the Secretary stated that the joint signatures of
the Chancellor and Secretary were required on requisitions for money
from the United States Treasury for carrying on the operations of the
Institution, and that on the Ist of next July the semi-annual interest
would be due, and some one who could act as Chancellor, within the
provisions of the iaw, must sign the requisition in connection with the
Secretary, at that time. .

On motion of Dr. Welling, a committee was appointed to express the
sense of the Board in relation to the death of the Chancetlor.

The Chair appointed Dr. Welling, Senator Morrill, and Professor
Langley.

H. Mis, 142——11 XVII
XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

The committee retired and on its return reported through the chair-
man, Dr. Welling, the following preamble and resolutions, which were
unanimously adopted:

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has
been called to meet in extraordinary session by the afflicting intelli-
gence that Morrison REmMIcK WAITE, late Chief-Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, and late Chancellor of the Smith-
sonian Institution, has been removed by the hand of death from the
scene of iis high activities and distinguished usefulness; therefore be it

Resolved, That sitting as we do at this time and place, in the very
center of that dark shadow whici: has fallen upon the whole laud in the
lamented death of the late Chief-Justice Waite, and appalled as we
are by the suddenness as well as by the magnitude of the great aftlic-
tion which in coming to the nation at large has come to us individually,
with an added pathos of sorrow because of the nearer view we have
had, for so many years, of the talents, virtues, and graces which found
their familiar home in the person of our honored friend, we could with
inuch good reason crave for ourselves, in this hour of bereavement, the
humble permission of mourning apart, that we might silently gauge
the depth and the dimensions of a calamity which brings to us its
message of personal grief and which has also torn away from our high-
est seat of justice its venerated and beloved chief; from the legal pro-
fession of the country its foremost official representative and therefore
its crowning exponent; from the walks of social life in this national
capital a commanding presence no less remarkable for his genial and
open-bhearted sincerity than for his affable and gracious benignity; and
from the Christian communion a true and faithful disciple who wit-
nessed a good confession as much by the simplicity and humility with
which he walked before God as by the unswerving consistency with
which he wore the ornament of a pure heart and of a meek and quiet
spirit before the serutiny of his fellow-men.

Resolved, That while an obvious sense of propriety must dictate that
we should leave to others in that great forum which was the chosen
arena of his life’s career the sad privilege of depicting, with minute
and detailed analysis, the remarkable combination of strong and lovely
traits which met in the person of the late Chief-Justice and gave to the
symmetrical character of our beloved friend its blended sweetness and
light, we can not omit, even in this hour of our special sorrow, to bear
our cheerful testimony to the pleasing amenity with which he presided
over the deliberations of this council chamber as the Chancellor of the
Smithsonian Lustitution, and sharing, as we all do, in a profound ad-
miration for the intelligence he brought to our discussions, while ever
moderating them by the guidance of his clear thought and mild wisdom,
we can but render our reverent homage to the engaging personal qual-
ities which endeared him to us as a man, while at the same time grate-
fully confessing our obligations to him for the provident care and deep
interest which he always brought to the discharge of his official duties
in this place, where, through all the years of his honorable and useful
service at the head of this Board, the Secretary of the Institution in
common with ourselves has leaned on him as the wise and true coun-
sellor who could be trusted as well for the rectitude of his moral intui-
tions as for the clear perceptions of his calm and judicious intellect.

_ Kesolved, That we will attend the funeral of our departed Chancellor
in a body, and that the Secretary of the Institution, together with a
deputation from the members of the Board, be requested to accompany
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIX

the other friends and associates of the late Chief-Justice who will bear
his remains to their last resting place in Ohio.

Resolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the
Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send a copy of them to
the family of our departed friend in token of our sincere condolence
with them in their great affliction.

On motion of Senator Cullom it was resolved, that Acting Chief-
Justice SAMUEL F. MILLER be elected Chancellor pro tem.

On taking the chair, Justice Miller remarked that in this hour of
grief it was a consolation to be honored with the appointment which
had just been conferred upon him, especially as it was not a necessity
of law that he as Acting Chief-Justice should have been selected to fill
this important position. While it would not be expected of him on tie
present occasion to deliver a eulogy on the late Chancellor, it was only
proper for him to say that, sitting beside Judge Waite as he had done
for four hours a day for about fourteen years, he felt as well qualified
to appreciate his character as any man living. He was an able judge,
an upright man, honest in every fiber of his nature. No sophistry
could induce him to act in violation of his conscience. He never was led
to believe only what he desired to believe, or to decide against his con-
victions of right. He wasa sound jurist, and above all an able manager
of our complicated legal administrative affairs. We can not do too
much to honor his memory.

He thanked the gentlemen of the Board for the honor they had con-
ferred in electing him Chancellor.

On motion of Mr. Phelps, it was resolved, that all or any of the mem-
bers of the Board, and the Secretary, who wish to attend the funeral
services of the late Chancellor at Toledo, be appointed to represent the
Board of Regents.

On motion, the Board then adjourned sine die.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

August 10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added, by authority of
Congress, act of February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson,
and savings from annual income and other sources, $134,831. To this

NORTH AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

An appropriation of $40,000 was made by Congress for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1588, for the prosecution of ethnological researches
under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
The actual conduct of these investigations has been placed by the See-
retary in the hands of Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Geological
Survey. Theabstracts of expenditures and balance sheets for this appro-
priation have been exhibited tous; the vouchers for the expenditures,
after approval by theSecretary, are paid by the disbursing clerk of the
Bureau of Ethnology and transmitted to the accounting officers of the

Treasury Department for settlement.

The balance available to meet outstanding liabilities on the Ist of
July, 1888, as reported by the official disbursing agent, is $7,847.08.

REPORT OF SAMUEL P. LANGLEY,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 188782.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present with this the customary
report for the year ending June 30, 1888.

This year is memorable for the loss to the Institution, not only of its
Chancellor and of others to be mentioned later, but of its late Secretary,
Spencer F. Baird.

I have endeavored elsewhere to characterize his character and serv-
ices, while yet feeling that one who has been so recently called to fill
his place is hardly the fittest person to adequately describe them ; but
that may surely be repeated here which is no secret to any one, that
a most honored and useful life, which might have been prolonged for
many years, came to an end which can not but be called premature,
largely through a too self-sacrificing devotion to the public service.

I shall also have to speak later of the loss to the Institution of its
Chancellor, the late Chief-Justice of the United States—a man whom
those honored with his acquaintance grew, in proportion to their
knowledge of him, to look up to and trust; and of one of its Regents,
Prof. Asa Gray, pre-eminent in science, but in whom, as in the Chief-
Justice, the qualities of the intellect were supplemented by others, such
that both inspired even in their official relations, a feeling not only of
respect, but of affection, which the formal intercourse of public life
rarely brings.

The past has, indeed, been a fatal year to the Institution; but these
great losses have been spoken of at length in its necrology, and L will
now ask to be allowed to preface this and the rest of my report by a
few personal words.

Although long acquainted with both Professor Henry and Professor
Baird [ had no official relationship with either until two years ago, when
the latter, in view of the end which he must have felt to be approaching,
asked me if I was disposed to assume a connection with the Institution
while continuing the scientific researches to which my life had been
chiefly devoted.

The position then tendered me, and later at your hands, that of Sec-
retary, was accepted, from the knowledge that in your view such re-
searches for the increase of knowledge, no less than administrative la-

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

bors, formed the essential duties of the place to which I was honored
by your invitation, though it has happened that this, the first year of
these duties, has been passed all but exclusively in purely administra-
tive work, of which there is alone occasion at present to speak.

The year was begun with the feeling that it was best to closely follow
the methods of my predecessors till a longer experience should have
brought material for independent judgment; but at its close I desire to
be allowed to say that every experience has enhanced my confidence in
their policy as a permanent guide; and if it be true, as has sometimes been
said, that men eminent in science are apt to be devoid of capacity in the
management of daily affairs, we must conclude that Professor Henry
was a singular exception to such a rule; for the practical wisdom of the
general lines of conduct laid down by him, and adopted by my honored
predecessor, so commend themselves to me in the light of daily service
that more trust in them is felt with every new trial.

From them there may, it seems to me, be deduced some general con-
siderations with reference to the Seneemen Institution and its asso-
ciate interests, of which the following brief summary represents those
general principles of official action by which I have sought to be guided.

If the position of the Smithsonian is that of a ward of the Govern-
ment, having property of its own, for which that Government acts the
part of a trustee, while leaving its administration wholly with the Re-
gents, it follows that the Institution enjoys a measure of independence,
and in it a power of initiative for good which ought to be deemed its
most privileged possession; so that any action which is taken by one
having its interests at heart, ought to be with this consideration of its
independence always in mind.

The Institution is for “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.” It is not primarily for the promotion of utilitarian interests,
which can be advanced through other channels, but for knowledge
in the highest and widest sense, including not only all pure science,
but even, in the words of Henry, “the true, the beautiful, as well as the
immediately practical;” and these interests it is to guard from all en-

tangling alliances,

In dealing with the circumstances of to-day, the Institution should
still be guided by these principles; but in bringing them to the test of
present needs, we are daily reminded that these same principles are now
to be often applied to quite new conditions.

The Smithsonian has under its charge besides the Museum, the Bureau
of Ethnology, which will be referred to later, and some minor interests,
which are, however, insignificant in comparison.

It has from time to time been proposed by friends outside of this
Institution that it should take on much wider cares than these, and
that it should be the center around which all the scientific establish-
ments of the Government might cluster. In the writer’s opinion it
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

would not be pachiis impossible, but it would certainly be difficult, to
make such a permanent arrangement consistently with the audopendetns
of the Smithsonian, and its continued devotion to the original objects
of its being; but since the project is from time to time renewed, it may
not be superfluous to observe that in any case the Museum would stand
on an entirely different footing from any other governmental bureau of
applied science, if only because it has been created in a very consider-
able degree out of the endowment income of the Institution; while other
scientific bureaus have grown up wholly independent of the Smithso-
nian, which has neither legal nor moral title to their property.

It must be admitted, however, that the line of demarcation, even in
the Museum, between the property to which the Smithsonian has an
undoubted legal title; that to which this claim is only presumptive; and
that to which it has no claim, is not in all cases at present clearly drawn,
and we are endeavoring to remedy this uncertainty. As regards the
care of this property, a great gain has been made in the past year by
carrying out (with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior) the
wishes which the Regents expressed in regard to the Museum at their
last meeting; so that it is no longer uncertain how far this care falls
upon the Institution, and how far upon the Interior Department.

Reference has just been made to the question of the general policy to
be followed by the Smithsonian with regard to its accepting the charge
of other Government departments of science, and this question is so far
from being an idle one that the Secretary has been called upon during
the past year to consider whether it was his duty to advise that the Fish
Commission, which until lately had such intimate though unofficial re-
lations with the Institution, should be united with it by a legal bond,
or not. While feeling that it would be in many respects most desira-
ble to connect with the Smithsonian the purely scientific portions of the
Fish Commission and its apparatus of research, he could not but recog-
nize that these were almost indissolubly mingled with certain great
utilitarian interests, which were not equally proper subjects of the
Smithsonian’s care; and after cousultation with those Regents whose
advice he could separately obtain, he felt unable to urge such a union
with any confidence thai it would meet the approbation of the Board.

The President saw fit to appoint as Commissioner, Dr. G. Brown
Goode, the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who,
while still, with my full consent, retaining that place, accepted the
office provisionally, from a sense of duty to the interests of the Fish
Commission, concerning which he had obtained an intimate acquaint-
ance under the late Professor Baird.

Having placed these interests on a proper footing; after a brief period
of laborious but wholly gratuitous service, he declined the higher salary
and permanent appointment of Commissioner which was pressed upon
him, and resumed the duties here*to which his scientific life has been
chiefly devoted.
‘L REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

On the 2d of December, 1887, the chancellor, Chief-Justice Waite,
under the provision of the law, designated Dr. G. Brown Goode as
Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution during the absence of
the Secretary.

If only from the ordinary need of a periodical revision, nearly every
department of the Institution has been the subject of examination, and
in some cases of considerable modification during the past year, and I
now proceed to speak of these in some detail, prefacing each with a
brief statement of such considerations as seem to me deserving of the
particular attention of the Regents.

BOARD OF REGENTS.

Meetings of the Board.—A special meeting of the Board was held No-
vember 18, 1887, to take action in regard to the death of the Secretary,
Spencer Fullerton Baird, and at this meeting Samuel Pierpont Langley
was elected his successor.

The stated annual meeting of the Board was held on the 11th Jan-
uary, 1888.

A special meeting of the Board was also held on the 27th March, 1888,
to take action in regard to the death of the chancellor of the Institution,
Chief-Justice Waite.

The journal of proceedings of the Board is given in full, as usual, in
the introduction of the Regents’ report.

Changes in the Board of Regents.—Other vacancies than those already
mentioned have occurred in the membership of the Board during the
year by the expiration of the legal terms of service.

Senator Maxey’s term ended March 3, 1887, and with the close of
the Forty-ninth Congress the terms of the Hon. O. RK. Singleton, of the
Hon. W. L. Wilson, and of the Hon. W. W. Phelps, members of the
House of Representatives, also expired; and on the 19th of December,
1887, the President of the Senate appointed the Hon. Randall Lee Gib-
son, Senator from Louisiana, a Regent for the term of six years, to fill
the vacancy occasioned by Senator Maxey’s retirement. On the 5th of
January, 1888, the Speaker of the House of Representatives appointed
the Hon. Samuel 8. Cox, of New York, a Regent in the place of the
Hon. Otho RK. Singleton; and on the 10th of January, 1888, he appointed .
the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, of Alabama, a Regent in the place of the Hon.
William L. Wilson, and re-appointed the Hon. William Walter Phelps,
of New Jersey, to continue his service as Regent. Lastly, by joint rese
lution of Congress, approved by President Cleveland, February 15, 1888,
Dr. Andrew D. White, of New York, was elected a Regent for the term
of six years, to fill the place of Dr. Asa Gray, deceased.

At the special meeting of the Board of Regents, held March 27, 1888,
Mr. Justice Samuel I’. Miller, senior Associate and acting Chief Justice
of the United States Supreme Court, was elegted to act as chancellor of
the Institution pro tempore. So
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

FINANCES.

While with this is presented the report of the Executive Committee
and other statements, showing that the funds are in the usual sense in
a satisfactory condition, this seems to be a proper occasion to say some-
thing about the larger questions of finance, for, as time passes, the
purchasing power of money imperceptibly but surely alters, until finally
the consideration is forced upon us that these slow changes, though
alinost inappreciable from year to year, have, in the half century already
elapsed since Congress accepted Smithson’s bequest, essentially dimin-
ished the actual value of the fund, while its nominal value remains
unchanged.

I do not now refer merely to the fact that we measure all things by
another scale in 1888 from what we did in 1836; or that, owing to the
immense increase of public wealth, the capital of the original bequest,
which then was greater than any but a few private fortunes, has be-
come relatively so inconsiderable to-day. More than this is meant. It
is meant that the actual purchasing power of each dollar is, for our
purposes, notably less; that it is being forced upon us that we ean not
print as many books, or pay as many employés, or make as many re-
searches as when the scheme of expenditure was first fixed, and that,
consequently, a scheme which was wise then, because not only desirable
but feasible, is not necessarily so now.

I know that this consideration is not presented to the Regents for the
first time, and that ascommitiee of their number, as long ago as 1877,
observed—

“That the income of fhe Smithsonian fund, while nominally fixed, is
growing actually less year by year, with the rapidly-changing value of
money, and of less and less importance in, the work that it accomplishes
with reference to the immense extension of the country since the Gov-
ernment accepted the trust.”

In a time, short with reference to the probable life of the Institution,
the income of the Smithsonian fund proper will necessarily become en-
tirely inadequate to carry on the object of Henry’s care on the scale
which he inaugurated. Even when this is the case, it seems to me that
this income of the Smithsonian bequest will stiil have a value wholly
beyond its nominal one, for it will at least maintain the Institution in
that position of independence and disinterestedness which are its most
potent means of influencing others to aid in carrying out the intention
of its founder.

It is, nevertheless, most evidently desirable that the fand should be
enlarged both by Governmental recontribution and by private bequest,
so as to constantly represent at least the original position of its finances
relatively to those of the country and contemporary institutions of learn-
ing; a position which we can estimate from the observation that there
are several such institutions, which were at first scarcely on a par with it
financially, but whose funds, having been invested so as to share in the
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

growth of the country, and aided by private benefaction, now surpass
ours from ten to twenty fold.

We can never regret the generous spirit which has dictated the direc-
tion of the expenditure of the Smithsonian income in the past, but it is
true that if a less absolutely unselfish policy had been followed—if, for
instance, though keeping up all proper expenditures for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge, those funds whose expenditure bas practi-
eally inured chiefly to the benefit of the General Government had been
allowed to accumulate—the Institution would have been comparatively
wealthy to-day.

I will instance, in explanation of my meaning, the remark of Profes-
sor Henry in 1872, to the effect that the Government, in equity, should
then have paid the Institution $300,000 for the use of the present build-
ing. This building, erected wholly out of Smithsonian funds at the cost
of over half a million dollars, has, with the exception of a small por-
tion, been ever since that time used rent-free by the Government; and
if the observation had force then, it has double force to-day.

Again, the Institution has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in
the Museum alone, property acquired out of its private fund (and to
which it has apparently the same title), which is probably now more
than equal in value to the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest.

While it is gratefully recognized that Congress has never dealt in any
ungenerous spirit with the Institution, I can not think it superfluous to
keep such facts as those just cited in mind at a time when it becomes
necessary to review the whole scheme of expenditure, in view of an
income practically diminishing, and which would, if not for these facts,
be more than double its actual amount.

The will of James Smithson, of England, “to found at Washington,
under the naine of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” was made Octo-
ber 23, 1826.

The existence of the bequest was communicated to Congress by a
message from the President of the United States December 17, 1835,
and by an act of Congress approved July 1, 1836, the bequest was ac-
cepted, and the President was authorized and enabled to assert and
prosecute with effect the claim of the United States to the property
thereby bequeathed and then held in trust by the English court of
chancery.

Under this authority the sum of $508,318.46 was received in gold by
the United States and placed in the Treasury.

The “Smithsonian Institution” provided for in the will of Smithson
was not established, however, by Congress until August 10, 1846, when
a definite plan of organization was adopted and operations commenced.

By act of Congress February 8, 1867, the Secretary of the Treasury
was authorized to receive a residuary legacy of Smithson, which had
been received by the Institution in 1863, amounting to $26,210.63, on
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (

the same terms as the original bequest. By the same act the Regents
were authorized to add to the Smithsonian fund such other sum as they
might see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the
sum of $1,000,000.

The original bequest and the sums since added are therefore as follows:

States, bearing interest at 6 per cent. per annum..-.--....-.----- 703, 000. 00

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand of the income
from the fund was $1,423.14. The interest paid semi-annually July 1,
1887, and January 1, 1888, was $42,180.

To this was added from sales of publications and miscellaneous sources
$752.86, making a total available amount for carrying on the operations
of the Institution of $44,356; totalexpenditures for the year, $39,546.77;
leaving a balance July 1, 1888, of $4,809.23.

It is proper in this connection to state that the Institution is charged
by Congress with the care and disbursement of sundry appropriations,
those for the past year being as follows:

The vouchers for all the expenditures from these appropriations as
well as those from the Smithsonian income are carefully examined and
passed upon by the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents, with
one exception—those for ethnological researches.

The disbursement of this appropriation from its commencement has
been made under the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell, who has been in
charge of the Bureau of Ethnology.

The necessity of greatly increased appropriations for the proper con-
duct of the interests committed by Congress to the care of the Insti-
tution is daily more manifest, and has been made known in the strongest
terms to the National Legislature.

The estimates prepared to be submitted for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1889, are as follows: |

8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In accordance with the instructions of the Board of Regents at its
last annual meeting, I requested the Committee on Appropriations of
the House of Representatives to make certain changes in the assign-
ment of appropriations and the method of their disbursement.

The following is the correspondence on the subject with the Secretary
of the Interior and with the chairman of the Committee on Appropria-
tions.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
February 29, 1888.

Str: I have the honor to make the following requests in regard to
the assignment of the appropriations for the maintenance of the U. 8.
National Museum for the coming fiscal year:

(1) That the items for “ preservation of collections,” “heating and
lighting,” ‘furniture and fixtures” be transferred from their present
position in the schedule of “ Estimates of Appropriations, 188889 ” (p.
237), under the Department of the Interior, to a place under the gen-
eral head of “‘under the Smithsonian Institution,” and along with and
in proximity to the other items to be expended under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution or its Secretary.

(2) That each of these items be placed directly under the subhead
“Under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as
director of the National Museum.”

(3) That a special item be inserted under the caption “ Public print-
ing and binding,” providing the sum of $10,000 for printing labels and
blanks for the use of the National Museum and for the ‘ Bulletins” and
annual volumes of the “‘ Proceedings” of the Museum.

In explanation of these requests, I submit the following statements :

Theactof Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution, approved
August 10, 1846 (Revised Statutes, Tithe LX XII, sections 5579, 5594),
“provided that all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and
all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical
specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States, which
may be in the city of Washington, shall be delivered to the Regents of
the Smithsonian Institution, and, together with new specimens obtained
‘ by exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classified
as best to facilitate their examination and study.

The National Museum, as it is now called, was thus placed under the
sole control and direction of the Smithsonian Institution, and has ever
since remained under its control; Congress having, since 1858, made
annual appropriations for its maintenance. Until 1880, however, the
Sums thus appropriated were inadequate, and the yearly deficiences
were paid from the income of the Institution.

In accordance with a practice of nearly thirty years the estimates for
the annual appropriations have been each year, at the request of the
Secretary of this Institution, forwarded by the Secretary of the Interior
to the Secretary of the Treasury for transmission to Congress, and the
disbursement of tlie appropriation has been made by the disbursing
agent of the Interior Department.

This arrangement is Somewhat inconvenient aud cumbersome, and at
the last meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
the following resolution was adopted :

“* Resolved, That the Regents recommend to Congress that the form
of the sundry civil appropriation bill be so changed in the terms relating
to the Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology as to provide—
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

“6(1) That these moneys shall be disbursed under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution.

(2) That the estimates for the appropriations of the Museum in the
future shall be sent direct to the Secretary of the Treasury by the
Smithsonian Institution through its Seeretary.”

In obedience to the wishes of the Board of Regents thus expressed,
the matter was brought to the attention of the Secretary of the Inte-
rior, in arecent interview, by Chief-Justice Waite (the Chancellor of the
Smithsonian Institution) and myself. Asa result of this meeting a
letter has been received from the Secretary of the Interior, in which he
expresses the opinion that changes may be made with great propriety
both in the manner of voting the appropriation and in the method of
its disbursement. A copy of this letter is herewith inclosed, together
with a copy of a second letter received in response to an inquiry as to
the manner in which this change may best be effected.

In further explanation of the third request, I wish to say that this
does not involve anew appropriation, since the estimate for this amount
is included, as I understand it, in the sum of $375,525 estimated by the
Secretary of the Treasury for the printing of the Interior Department
and its Bureaus (see page 129 of the ‘“‘ Estimates of Appropriations,
1888—89”). I may say in further explanation of this item that an ap-
propriation has thus been made for the printing of the National Museum
for at least twelve years past, and I am informed that the amount al-
lotted during recent years has usually been $10,000,

I believe these changes will be in the interest of the public service,
and respectfully ask that they be made.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
Hon. SAMUEL J. RANDALL, -
Chairman of Committee on Appropriations,
House of Representatives.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Washington, February 14, 1888.

Sir: I have considered the topic of the conference which I had the
honor to have yesterday with the Chancellor of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and yourself, being the relation of the Interior Department to
the expenditure of the appropriation for the increase and care of the
National Museum, which is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, and
whetber there be objection to the recommendation of an independency
in the disbursement of the funds provided for its support as well as in
its management.

The first collection of scientific curiosities which appears to have been
a special object of care on the part of Congress was that made by the
Wilkes Exploring Expedition, provided for by the act of May 14, 1836
(5 Stats., 29). This collection was first placed in the care of the Na-
tional Institution for the Promotion of Science, and afterwards was
transferred to the hall in the second story of the Patent Office. In
1846, when the act for the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution
was passed, it was provided that, ‘as suitable arrangements could be
made for their reception, all objects of art, and of foreign and curious
research, and all objects of natural history, plants, geological and min-
eralogical specimens, belonging or hereafter to belong to the United
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesover custody
the same may be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be author-
ized by the Board of Regents to receive them, and shall be arranged in
such order and so classed as best to facilitate the examination and study
of them in the building so as aforesaid to be erected for the Institu-
tion;” provision having been made in the act for a suitable building,
etc. It was provided by Congress that the Smithsonian Institution
might be constructed adjacent to the Patent Office Building, but the
project was not accepted, and an independent building, where now
located, was arranged, this being completed in the year 1853.

It is said that the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of
Patents were desirous of removing the collections of the exploring ex-
pedition and of the National Institution out of the Patent Office Build-
ing, and requested the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to receive
them. This appears to have been acceded to by the Regents on the
condition imposed that the Secretary of the Interior should provide for
the payment of the expenses of the keeping and care of the collections.

An appropriation of $15,000 was made by Congress in the act of
March 3, 1857, for the construction of cases, and of $2,000 for the re-
moval of the articles. It was then held by the Attorney-General, in
response to a request of the Secretary of the Interior for his opinion,
that the provision in the eighth section of the act of the 4th ef August,
1854 (10 Stats., 572), placing the collections under the control of the
Commissioner of Patents, and authorizing the employment by bim of .:
keepers therefor, was designed to be temporary only, and that the act
establishing the Smithsonian Institution, as well as that making the
appropriation in 1857, were to be regarded as indicating the purpose of
Congress respecting permanent provision for these collections.

In 1858, by the act of the 2d of June (11 Stats., 301), an appropria-
tion of $4,000 “ for the preservation of the collection ot the exploring
and surveying expeditions of the Government” was made as a contin-
gent expense in the office of the Secretary of the Interior. This ap-
pears to have been the product of the condition acceded to by the Sec-
retary of the Interior upon the oceasion of the removal of the collections
from the Patent Office to the Smithsonian; and, pursuing the same
practice in October, 1858, Professor Henry, your illustrious predecessor,
requested of the Secretary of the Interior the renewal of the same ap-
propriation. Since that time this course appears to have been pursued
without any other reason for its support than this summary narration
indicates.

By the seventh section of the act for the establishment of the Smith-
sonian Institution (9 Stats., 105) the Secretary is directed to discharge
the duties of “ keeper of the Museum,” and authorized, with the con-
sent of the board, to employ assistants. No power of appointment of
any of the officers who expend the money provided by these annual ap-
propriations is supposed to exist, or, since the transfer to the Smith-
sonian, has ever been exercised by any officer of this Department.

The manner of the appropriation has operated to impose upon the
disbursing officer of this Department the duties of an auditor and a
treasurer for this fund, as an officer for whom the Secretary is respon-
sible. But no authvrity over the expenditures appears to rest with the
Secretary of the Interior or at least ever to have been exercised, so that
any Scrutiny supposable has been thatonly of an auditor. Practically the
disbursement of this appropriation has been made by the officers of the
Smithsonian Institution, subject to two audits, one by this Department
and the other by the Treasury, while the disbursing officer of the In-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

terior Department acts as the disbursing officer for the Smithsonian, and
a clerk has been assigned, as I am informed, by the Smithsonian to duty
in the Interior Department to assist the disbursing officer.

Obviously there is nothing in the relations between the Smithsonian
and the Interior Department to require the continuance of this state of
things. The National Museum enjoys now an anoual appropriation of
a large amount in the various items, not usually less than $150,000. In
the last act the appropriation was of $12,000 for heating, lighting, elec-
trical, and telephonic service; of $116,000 for the preservation, exhibi-
tion, and increase of the collections; and of $40,000 for cases, furniture,
fixtures, and appliances; both of the latter items embracing salaries.
These items indicate not only the considerable proportions which the
Museum has attained, but that their disbursement should be in the
hands of those who have the government ot the Museum and a direct
responsibility exacted.

So far, then, from there appearing to be objection, the facts suggest
to my mind the wisdom and desirability of providing for the National
Museum directly, and imposing responsibility fer the disbursement of
the appropriation immediately upon the officers of that Institution, and
with accountability to the Treasury, as in other cases.

The act of July 7, 1884 (23 Stats., 214), was a step in the direction
of this independency of requiring the director of the National Museum
to report annually to Congress the progress of the Museum during the
year and its present condition.

The papers you kindly loaned me are herewith returned.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
Wm. F. VILAS,
Secretary.
Prof. S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretaru of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
Washington, February 20, 1888.

Siz: Replying to your favor of the 16th instant, I beg to say that it
seems to me that so long as Congress has made the appropriation for
the current year ‘under the Interior Department” in terms, it is neces-
sary that it should be expended according to the practice hitherto
prevailing; and that, if the same terms of appropriation should be
continued, it would be with the expectation that the fixed practice of
disbursement would continue also. It is therefore probably necessary
that the language of the appropriation should be changed in order to
effect the object desired. It may be presumed the accounting officers
of the Treasury would require it.

The same observations may be applied to the appropriation for print-
ing. I think it desirable that that should be separately made, so that
the Smithsonian Institution should be independent, in its use of the
provisions made by Congress, of this Department, and this Department
freed of care in respect to it.

Yours, respectfully,
Wm. F. VILAS,
Secretary.
Prof. 8. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It was anticipated that when the wishes of the Regents were communi-
cated to the Appropriations Committee of the House, the objection
might be raised that the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, as
such, was not an officer of the Government in the sense that the head
of an executive department is, and that this might be an obstacle to
the proposed transfer.

Such objection was, in fact, made in the committee, and for this rea-
son the bill as reported from the House committee places the Museum
appropriation “under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as
director of the National Museum ;” while at the same time this, with the
other appropriations, is subordinated to the general title “under the
Smithsonian Institution.”

In regard to the Bureau of Ethnology, the Secretary had already
represented to the Regents his desire to see such a modification of the
wording as might relieve him from the personal responsibility imposed
by the language of former bills. The change actually introduced by
the committee consists in making the former words ‘under the di-
rection of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution” subordinate
to the same general title ‘‘ under the Smithsonian Institution.”

Should the bill as reported pass both houses the disbursements for
the National Museum will hereafter be made by an officer designated
by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, duly qualified and
bonded to the acceptance of the Secretary of the Treasury, whose of-
fice will be in the Smithsonian building, instead of by the disbursing
officer of the Department of the Interior, as heretofore.

The appropriations for “ international exchanges” will also be dis-
bursed by the same clerk at the Institution, instead of the disbursing
clerk of the Treasury Department.

This new arrangement, while adding greatly to the responsibilities
and cares of the officers of the Institution, will, it is believed, secure
good results.

International exchanges.—The regular estimate submitted to Congress
was as follows:

For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the
United States and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smith-
sonian Institution, including salaries or compensation of all necessary
employés, $15,000.

A revised estimate was submitted to Congress through the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, on May 31, 1888, asking for $27,050 for the ex-
changes.

The House committee declined to recommend the proposed increase.
It was then laid before the Senate Committee on Appropriations and
an argument presented in favor of the increase, which induced the com-
mittee to report an amendment to the sundry civil bill increasing the
appropriation from $15,000 to $20,000.*

* See Congressional Record, July 29, 1888, page 7666.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

This amendment was adopted by the Senate, rejected by the House,
and finally lost in conference committee of the two houses, so that the
increase of appropriation for exchanges is only $3,000 for the next fis-
cal year.

Preservation of collections——The appropriation asked for this service
was $150,000. The House committee reported $120,000; the Senate
committee, $125,000, and this latter amount was finally agreed to.

Furniture and fixtures.—An estimate of $40,000 was submitted, ac-
cepted by both committees, and passed by Congress.

Heating and lighting —The original estimate “ for expense of heating,
lighting, and electrical and telephonic service for the National Museum,”
was $12,000. This sum was reported by the House Committee on Ap-
propriations and adopted by Congress without change.

Armory building.—For several years this building has been occupied
jointly by the National Museum and the U. 8. Fish Commission, the lat-
ter paying the expenses of its care and repairs since July 1, 1885.

The House Committee on Appropriations in reporting the item of
$120,000, for “preservation of the collection of the National Museum”
inserted the following clause: *“‘ And for the care and custody of the so-
called Armory building,” thus transferring the whole of the building and
its maintenance to the Museum.

The Senate Committee on Appropriations, after hearing a statement
from the U.S. Fish Commissioner,* struck out this clause, and inserted
the following under the items for the Fish Commission :t

Provided, That the building known as the Armory building, Wash-
ington, District of Columbia, is hereby transferred to the charge of the
United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries for use as a hatching
and distributing station and for offices.

These diverse views were finally reconciled by the conference com-
mittees, who reported the following, which became a law: “+ Under the
U. S. Commission of Fish and Fitheries.”

Provided, That the building known as the Armory building, Wash-
ington, District of Columbia, shall be occupied as at present, jointly by
the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries and the National
Museum.

North American Ethnology.—The regular estimate for ‘ continuing
ethnological researches among the American Indians, under the diree-
tion of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, including salaries
or compensation of all necessary employés,” was $50,000.

The House Committee on Appropriations, however, only reported
$40,000, the sum which has been appropriated annually since 1884,
This sum was accepted by both the House and the Senate, and is the
amount appropriated. The appropriation is placed in the language of
former years ‘“‘ under the direction of the Secretary,” but at his request
this with other departments is placed under the general caption ‘under
the Smithsonian Institution.”

14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Report of the expenditures to be made to Congress —The House Com-
mittee on Appropriations proposed a clause in the sundry civil bill for
the next fiscal year which was agreed to by Congress and forms part of
the act (No. 307), which is as follows:

That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution shall submit to
Congress at its next session a detailed statement of the expenditures of
the fiscal year 1883, underappropriations for “ International Exchanges,”
‘North American Ethnology,” and the “ National Museum,” and annu-
ally thereafter a detailed statement of expenditures under said appro-
priations shall be submitted to Congress at the beginning of each reg-

Among other matters discussed at the last meeting of the Regents
was the erection of a new Museum building. On this occasion the Re-
gents tacitly re-affirmed their resolution of 1582, recommending to Con-
gress the enlargement of the National Museum by the erection of a fire-
proof building on the southwest corner of the Smithsonian reservation,
similar in style to the present National Museum; but on viewing the
sketch plans, which had been prepared subsequently to the resolution,
so as to include offices for the Geological Survey, they added an ex-
pression of their opinion that the new building should be planned ex-
clusively for Museum purposes.

It was not at first intended to take action in this matter during the
present year, but the overcrowded condition of the building, on account
of which not only the current werk but the proper development of the
collections is greatly impeded, seemed to render immediate action nec-
essary. A still more urgent need appeared to be the unsatisfactory
sanitary condition of the new Museum building. A committee, consist-
ing of Dr. J. H. Kidder, chairman, Dr. James M. Flint, U.S. Navy, and
Mr. J. K. Watkins, was appointed on April 14 to make a careful study
of the water supply, ventilation, and drainage, and in May submitted
a preliminary report, from which it appeared that an alarming amount
of sickness and mortality has been manifest among the employés since
1881—a mortality which ean not be attributed to the location of the
building, which has sometimes been pronounced unsanitary, since there
has been ne corresponding percentage of ill health in the old Smithson-
ian building adjoining. The number of days lost by employés on ac-
count of sickness in 1836 was 796; in 1887,875; and in 1888, up to May
10, 215, by far the largest part of this loss of time being attributed on
the books of the Museum to miasmatie diseases. The committee states
that there is no reasonable doubt that some, if not all, of the ten deaths
since 1881 were hastened or induced by the unwholesome condition of
this building. The committee suggested repairs and modifications of
considerable extent, including the construction of continuous cellars
under each of the four sides of the building, which, in addition to the
other necessary expenses, would cost in the neighborhood of $40,000,
REPORY OF THE SECRETARY. 15

This state of affairs seemed to demand decided action, and it being
absolutely impossible to make any changes in the present building with-
out entirely vacating a portion of it for a considerable period of time,
the exigency for more accommodation seemed a great deal more urgent
than had been at first supposed.

While it became evident, ou study ot the question, that for the ulti-
mate needs of the Museum, a building of but one story occupying the
same area as the present Museum would be insufficient, the question
of immediate action was unexpectedly brought up in May by one of the
senior Regents, a member of the Senate, who, when visiting the Museum
with some friends, noticed its crowded and unsatisfactory condition.
Having learned from me of the mortality and sickness of the employés,
he inquired as to the feasibility of erecting a new building, and offered
to use his influence to procure an appropriation, if 1 could obtain for
him a set of sketch plans-within a week, time being, as he stated, a very
essential condition. After consulting with the chairman of your Exec-
utive Committee, I had no hesitation in accepting such an offer, but a
difficulty arose from the fact that the sketch plans which had been laid
before the Regents in 1882 were in part for purposes which the Regents
had at their last meeting disapproved, and that hence they could not
be used. By great diligence, however, plans for a building to be de-
voted exclusively to Museum purposes were prepared within the time
mentioned. These were based upon an extensive accumulation of
notes and drawings, embodying the record of the best recent work of
museum construction in this country and in Europe, and they were for
a building, as far as was consistent with these improvements, like the
existing Museum. The report submitted by Senator Morrill, to accom-
pany Senate bill 3134, contains the correspondence on which action
_was taken, and I have discussed the acts therein presented elsewhere
under the proper heads.*

The following bill was introduced by Senator Morrill on June 12, was
passed by the Senate on June 20, and at the end of the fiscal year was
in the hands of the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds:

A BILL for the erection of an additional fire-proof building for the use of the National
Museum.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the sum of five hundred
thousand dollars is hereby appropri iated, out of any money in the Treas-
ury not otherwise appropriated, or so much thereof as may be neces
sary, for the erection of a fire- proof building for the use of the } National
Museum, to cover three hundred feet square, and to consist of two
stories and basement, to be erected under the direction of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution, i in accordance with the plans now on file
with the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, on the south-
western portion of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution. Said
building to be placed west of the Smithsonian Tustitution, leaving a

roadway between it and the latter of not less than forty feet, with the
north front on a tine with the south face of the building of the A gricult-
ural Department and of the Smithsonian Institution; and all expendi-
tures for the purpose herein mentioned shall be audited by the proper
officers of the Treasury Department.

The building, as proposed, covers the same area as the present
Museum, and is of the same general style, so far as is consistent with
the introduction of a second story, thus affording nearly three times as
much accommodation under the same area of roof as the building now
in use. The arrangement of the interior of the proposed new structure
is, however, considerably modified, as the result of the experience of
seven years’ occupation of the present building. The eighteen exhi-
bition halls on the two main floors are completely isolated from each
other, and are capable of subdivision into smaller hails. The lighting
will be equally as good as in the present building, the ventilation will
be much better, and in other important respects the sanitary arrange-
ments will be far more satisfactory.

A basement story is absolutely necessary, not only with a view to
promoting the comfort and health of visitors and employés, as well as
for securing greater dryness and better preservation of the specimens,
but also for the purpose of providing large apartments for store-rooms
and workshops. These proposed improvements in arrangement will
not, however, interfere with the possibility of constructing a building
which shalt conform in the essential points of exterior proportion with
the main features of the present building.

The present building contains about 80,000 square feet of floor space
available for exhibition and storage. The building proposed will con-
tain about 220,000 square feet. The amount of room for offices and
laboratories would be about the same in each. The net areain the new
building available for exhibition, storage, and office rooms, as esti-
mated, would be between 5 and 6 acres.

For the construction of the present Museum Building an appropria-
tion of $250,000 was made. This sum was supplemented by the follow-
ing special appropriations: $25,000 for steam-heating apparatus,
$26,000 for marble floors, $12,500 for water and gas fixtures and elec-
trical apparatus, and $1,900 for special sewer connections. The total
amount expended on this building was therefore $315,400, and it is
generally admitted that the cost of its construction was considerably
less than that of any other similar building in existence; in fact, per-
haps too cheap to secure the truest economy.

The proposed structure can be erected at a proportionately smaller
cost. I have obtained from responsible bidders, who are willing to give
bonds for the completion of the work in accordance with the bids which
they have submitted, estimates for the erection of the building com-
plete, with steam-heating apparatus and all other essential appliances,
excepting the electrical equipment, amounting in the aggregate to
$473,000, These bids, upon which the estimates of cost have been made,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

were not competitive, aud it is possible that something may be saved
through competition. It is, however, necessary to provide also for the
architect’s superinten dence, and for the removal and reconstruction of
the Smithsonian stable, which now occupies the site. I therefore think
it advisable to make request for the sum of $500,000, in order that these
additional items and other contingencies may be covered.

The plans, though drawn in the limited time imposed, represent the
results of an exhaustive study—which has extended over several years—
of plans of the best modern museum buildings in Europe and America,
nearly all of which have been personally inspected by officers of the
Smithsonian Institution.

It will be remembered by the Regents that neither the central por-
tion of the Smithsonian Building nor the so-called “ chapel,” at its west-
ern extremity, has ever been made fire-proof. The first contains valua-
ble collections, which are in somewhat menacing neighborhood to the
paint shop outside and to alcoholic stores within. These ought to be
provided for separately, but the representations made of the necessity
have not yet obtained attention from Congress. A special occasion
having arisen which made it desirable, at any rate, to complete the tire-
proofing of the ‘‘ chapel,” on the 21st May, at the request of the Sec-
retary, Hon. J. S. Morrill reported from the Committee on Public
Buildings the following bill:

A BILL to provide for making the west end of the Smithsonian Building fire-proof,
and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That for the purpose of making
the roof of the Gothic chapel at the west end of the Smithsonian Build-
ing fire-proof, and for other purposes, under the direction of the Re-
gents of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of seventeen thousand
five hundred dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby
appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appro-
priated.

This bill was adopted without a dissenting vote by the United States —
Senate.

It was referred in the House May 22, 1888, to the Committee on
Public Buildings, but no report was made by the committee. The same
bill was offered in the Senate on the 28th of June by Senator Morrill as
an amendment reported by the Senate Committee on Public Buildings
and Grounds to the sundry civil bill. This was referred to the Senate
Committee on Appropriations, but was not reported back.

Fire-proofing west range of Smithsonian building.—In 1887 Congress
made an appropriation of $15,000 “for urgent and necessary repairs to
central and western portions of the Smithsonian Institution.”*

This was expended in removing the combustible material in the west
range, as this was the most urgent work required. The contents of

this part of the building, consisting of the alcoholic collections, were
very inflammable and dangerous. The fire-proofing was intrusted to
Messrs. Cluss and Schulze, architects, from whose report the following
account of the work is taken:

“The reconstruction extended over the curtain between the main
building and the west wing, a building of 60 feet in length and 54 feet
in width, with an adjoining turret containing stairs. It contains a
basement where alcoholic specimens are kept.

‘The main story is mostly occupied by an exhibition hall, extending
up into the roof, with a clere-story. Along the north front was origi-
nally an open cloister, which had been, for many years, temporarily fitted
up, by frame-work, for offices. .

‘ Permanent provision was made for these purposes, and a mezzanine
story formed by the insertion of a fire proof upper floor.

‘‘ Besides the old, rotten, combustible floors and roofs, a complicated
system of decorative hollow columns and vaults, framed of wooden
scantlings, boards, and lathed plastering, had to be carefully removed,
so as not to injure the outside walls, consisting of a thin cut-stone fac-
ing, backed by ordinary rubble-work.

“In the reconstruction the Romanesque general character of the
building was preserved with the greatest simplicity compatible with
the surroundings, and also made a necessity by the limited appropria-
tion, in conjunction with the increased cost of decorations in fire-proof
materials.

“The first advertisement for bids for the work was confined to what
was required for making the reconstructed building ready for ocecu-
pancy; and to leave desirable but not absolutely necessary improve-
ments and internal finishings to any balance left from the appropria-
tion.

‘* Under date of June 27, 1887, an advertisement was issued for the
wrought and cast iron work, and the award made to C. A. Schneider’s
Sons, of this city, at $1,848, the lowest bid received.

‘“‘On July 6, 1887, another advertisement was issued for cut-stone
work, brick-work, fire-proofing, metal-roofing, lighter iron-work, corru-
gated-iron lathing, carpenter’s work, plastering, and miscellaneous work.
There was no bid below that of D. T. Cissel, of Washington, which
amounted to $9,850, and was within the estimates.

** Miscellaneous minor operations, such as cleaning and clearing the
building, steam fitting, and electric work, were done by day’s work and
settled for on pay-rolls.

‘‘The hardware was obtained in open market, by competition among
the principal dealers of the city, on specifications.

‘“The contractors have satisfactorily and for the sums agreed upon
completed their work.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

The east room, used for the meeting of the Regents, has had such
improvements made in its ventilation as the defective construction of
the building in this respect admitted, and I have taken occasion to draw
on the different departments of the Smithsonian for its furniture, so
that this may recall in some measure the various interests under the
Regents’ care.

RESEARCHES.

From the foundation of the Institution the promotion of original re-
search has been regarded as one of its important functions under the
general provision of Smithson’s bequest, and by encouraging and facili-
tating the discovery of new truths it is obvious that the primary pur-
pose of the founder—the increase of knowledge—can be most efficiently
attained.

Natural science falls into two great divisions, the biological and the
physical, and since it has been the case that of late years the first of
these has been almost exclusively encouraged by the Smithsonian, it
was the desire of the late Secretary, Professor Baird, to do something
to restore the balance, and with this end in view he had made prepara-
tions to secure an astro-physical observatory and laboratory, and though
these preparations were interrupted by his death it is understood that
through his action some friends of the Institution have already offered
to give the means for the erection of the modest structure needed for
the accommodation of such a special observatory. The site would nec-
essarily be suburban, on account of the especial need of seclusion and
the absence of tremor in the soil, such as is felt in the neighborhood of
the streets of a city.

No steps have yet been taken to secure a site, but in view of the
promise of meaus for the building, and the fact that the construction of
the necessary apparatus will occupy a leng time, I have ordered such
of the essential pieces as are not likely to be ready, even under these
conditions, till the building is prepared to receive it. With the excep-
tion of this preparation there has been nothing done for the increase
of knowledge in the physical branches of science in the-past year, but
it may be remarked that the Institution is in possession of a certain
amount of philosophical apparatus. This is formed of the débris of its
first collection (nearly destroyed by the fire) and of a certain few pieces
purchased by Professor Henry in the later years of his life.

There are also a number of historical relics, as the philosophical
instruments used by Dr. Joseph Priestly and others. These were on
exhibition in the new Museum Building, but the room they occupied
being wanted for other purposes the collection was transferred to the
Smithsonian Building where they were placed in an apartment adjoining
the laboratory. Arrangements are now being made for a more suit-
able depository and for the exhibition to the publie of such articles of
this class as may be of general interest.

The Institution has continued to give an important impulse to the
20 RERORT OF THE SECRETARY.

prosecution of the biological sciences, but most largely so, indirectly
through the Museum and Bureau of Ethnology.

The chief research has been under an arrangement made by the
late Secretary. Prof. E. D. Cope has been engaged during the en-
tire year in completing and preparing for publication the results of
an investigation upon the reptiles and batrachians of North Ameriea,
which has been in progress under the direction of the Institution for
more than twenty years. The first part, consisting of a Monograph on
the Batrachians, has been handed in and sent to the Public Printer, and
the work of printing it as one of the bulletins of the National Museum
has been already begun.

The expense entailed in the publication has been much greater than
the late Secretary anticipated, but I have felt it proper to continue it,
not only to carry out a purpose which had engaged the interest of Pro-
fessor Baird, but on account of the great intrinsic importance and value
of the work itself. No complete memoir on the Batrachians of North
America has ever been published; while the projected work enters
fully into questions of anatomy and geographical distribution, in addi-
tion to the customary discussion of classification and synonymy, and
will supply a long-felt need of biologists not alone in America but
throughout the world.

The second part, relating to the Reptiles, is in progress, and its com-
pletion is promised during the coming year.

Important investigations are in progress at the hands of the curators
and their assistants in every department of the Museum, for which ref-
erence may be made to that portion of my report.

EXPLORATIONS.

Our function in promoting the increase of knowledge has always been
regarded as including in its scope and object explorations at distant or
less familiar localities. Though no special explorations independent of
those already undertaken in connection with the Fish Commission have
been made during the past year, I am in hearty accord with the policy
of giving such encouragement to the lines of investigation heretofore
prosecuted in this respect as may be practicable from the portion of
our income which can be thus appropriated.

The activity in exploration this year is not less than heretofore, but
it has chiefly been carried on by the appropriation for ethnological re-
searches. This has been placed by law under your Secretary, who has
continued the arrangement, in some sense inherited from his predeces-
sors, under which the direction of the expenditure has been left almost
wholly within the discretion of Maj. J. W. Powell, from the confidence
felt equally in his scientific acquirements as an ethnologist and his
known capacity as an administrator. The usual report of the Bureau
of Ethnology is given elsewhere.

There has also been a limited amount of exploration carried on in con-
nection with the Museum.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

Mr. Romyn Hitchcock, one of the curators of the Museum, has been
for two years ou leave of absence, while performing the duty of profes-
sor of English at the University Osaka, Japan, and has been assisted
as far as has been practicable in his explorations in the west and north
of the Japanese Archipelago.

Two of the geological curators have explored numerous mineral locali-
ties in connection with the work of completing the sets of minerals for
distribution. Their work is referred to in the report of the Museum.

Two employés of the Museum accompanied the Fish Commission
schooner Grampus on her trip to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, for the pur-
pose of taking advantage of the opportunity, should any offer, of
exploring the natural history of the islands of that region, and par-
ticularly to make search for the remains of the Great Auk. They
were successful in their efforts, obtaining important collections and
material for a report which will be presented in connection with the
work of the Museum.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. Charles H. Townsend, of the
U.S. Fish Commission, was engaged in the joint service of the Commis-
sion and the Museum in natural history exploration in Central Amer-
ica. He returned in October, 1887.

Ensign A. P. Niblack, U. 8S. Navy, (for three years attached to the
scientific staff of the Museum,) during a cruise upon the coast of Alaska
made extensive collections and obtained material for a report on the
ethnology of that region.

PUBLICATIONS.

Classes of publications.—Of the Smithsonian publications, the first
class—both in priority of introduction and in scientific importance—is
the quarto series of Contributions to Knowledge. This series, numbering
twenty-five volumes, was inaugurated forty years ago.

An early hope had been entertained that the Institution might be
enabled to issue one volume of the quarto series each year, but it was
soon discovered that original memoirs of merit, embodying new acquisi-
tions to our knowledge, could not be procured at any such rate. Partly
by reason of the rapid growth of scientific institutions in our country,
and partly by reason of the largely increased endowments of some of
them, other channels of scientific publication have been opened, and
there has been a steady reduction both in the number of memoirs pre-
sented to this Institution for publication and in the numbers of these
judged deserving of a place in the ranks of the “‘ Contributions.” This
diminution of fertility is perhaps best exhibited by the following table
of volumes issued during each successive period of ten years:

During first decade (from 1848 to 1857), nine volumes.

During second decade (ending 1867), six volumes.

During third decade (ending 1877), six volumes,

During fourth decade (ending 1887), four volumes.
22 REPORT OF TRE SECRETARY.

It may be stated that the last volume of this series (Volume XXvV) was
issued in 1885, and that one memoir of 196 pages, with five chromo-
lithographic plates, ‘‘ Researches upon the Venoms of Poisonous Ser-
pents” (by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell and Dr. Edward T. Reichert) has since
been published (1886) as an installment for Volume XxxvI.

The second class of Smithsonian publications is the octavo series of
Miscellaneous Collections, which was not organized until nearly a quarter
of a century later than the ‘ Contributions,” the first volume having
been published in 1862.

As estimated by the number of volumes published during the period
of its existence, now amounting to thirty-three, this series (as was to
have been expected) has grown about twice as rapidly as the former.

In addition to these two classes of works, published at the expense
of the Smithsonian fund, three other series of works are issued under
the direction of the Institution, the publication of which is provided for
by Congressional appropriations.

Of these, first in order may be mentioned the Annual Reports to Con-
gress of the Board of Regents of the Institution, in accordance with the
provisions of Revised Statutes, section 5593, enacting that the Board
shall submit to Congress at each session thereof a report of the opera-
tions, expenditures, and condition of the Institution. These are in
octavo form, and have gradually increased in bulk from a few hundred
pages to two thick volumes per annum. Although printed by the Gen-
eral Government, these reports have been a constant and increasing
charge upon the funds of the Institution, required by the preparation
of suitable material for the usual appendix, in illustration of particular
investigations, or of the principal advances made in science. For a
number of years past the expenditure for this purpose has amounted to
several thousand dollars for each year, and it has become a serious
question whether we can longer afford to bear the burden. If Congress
can be induced to make a small appropriation for the collection and
preparation of information relative to the annual progress in the United
States of scientific discovery, and of its technological applications, to
be appended to the Smithsonian Report, such a record would not only
be in keeping with the great objects of this Institution, but would main-
tain for its report its high popular and educational character as well as
promote the industrial interests of our country, and the trifling expend-
iture would seem to be well justified by the precedents of similar appro-
priations for obtaining and diffusing valuable information through the
medium of the Agricultural and other official reports.

In the original “ programme of organization,” approved by the Regents
December 8, 1847, was specified among the details of the plan for diffus-
ing knowledge ‘“ the publication of a series of reports giving an account
of the new discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to
year in all branches of knowledge not strictly professional.” And it was

added, “‘ The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the
different branches of knowledge.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

In the Smithsonian Report for 1854 appeared for the first time an “ap-
pendix,” containing an account of American explorations for the years
1853 and 1854, by Prof. S. F. Baird; a full report of lectures delivered
before the Institution by Marsh, Brainard, Loomis, Channing, Reed, and
Russell; extracts from the scientific correspondence of the Institution ;
and miscellaneous papers relating to American archeology, geology,
ete. This general appendix to the Annual Report of the Regents has
been regularly continued to the present time (for more than the third of
a century), and has served to bring the Smithsonian Report into great
popular demand.

In the Report for 1880 (after the abandonment by the publishing
house—the Harpers, of New York-—of an ‘Annual Record of Science
and Industry”), a systematic ‘‘ Record of Scientific Progress,” compiled
by various specialists, was made the principal feature of the general ap-
pendix by my predecessor. This annual scientific summary, however
acceptable and however conformable to the plans originally laid down,
has labored under two very serious difficulties: First, that from the vex-
atious delay of publication the record of recent science lost much of its
interest and value; and, secondly, that the expense of its preparation
(averaging $2,500 per annum) has become more and more a tax upon
the Smithsonian income that could be but illy afforded. To this may
be added a practical difficulty in getting all the different summaries
completed at the time of making up the general appendix, so that an
omission of one or more branches occurred in every report. Under these
circumstances, it has become a serious question as to the manner in
which this appendix to the Report is to be maintained, if maintained
at all.

An additional complication of the question may be referred to, arising
out of the construction given to an act of Congress approved August
4, 1886, and since continued from year to year, which prescribes that
heads of departments ‘ before transmitting their annual reports to Con-
gress, the printing of which is chargeable to this appropriation, shall
cause the same to be carefully examined, and shall exclude therefrom
all matter including engravings, maps, drawings, and illustrations, ex-
cept such as they shall certify in their letters transmitting such reports
to benecessary, and to relate entirely to the transaction of public busi-
ness.” (Statutes, Forty-ninth Congress, first session; chapter 902,
page 255.)

This restriction has been held by the Public Printer to apply equally
to the reports of the Regents to Congress, which are printed under the
provisions of this appropriation. This consideration seems to furnish
an additional reason for having the supplementary matter of the report
placed under a special clause of authorization, for the avoidance of all
question as to the “necessity and entire relation to the public business”
of such general scientific information.

The second series to be mentioned under this head consists of the
24 , REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

publications of the U.S. National Museum, comprising its “ Bulletins”
and its “Proceedings.” The Bulletins of the National Museum were
instituted for the purpose of furnishing a prompt publication of origi-
nal descriptions of specimens received, and of thus illustrating the
mineral, botanical, zoological, and ethnological collections belonging to
the Museum. They consist of monographs on biological subjects, check-
lists, taxonomic systems, ete., and are prepared mainly by the curators
and other attachés of the establishment. This series was commenced
in 1875, and now numbers thirty-two Bulletins. These memoirs, from
their variety of subject, are naturally of very unequal extent, ranging
from fifty to over one thousand pages. Collected, they form nine large-
sized octavo volumes. , é

The Proceedings of the National Museum consist of shorter and less
elaborate papers, designed to give early accounts of its recent acces-
sions, or of freshly acquired facts relating to natural history, ete., and
are promptly issued in single “ signatures,” as soon as matter sufficient
to fill sixteen pages has been prepared, the date of issue being given
on each signature. These “ Proceedings” thus partake of the character
of an irregular periodical, the numbers of which—contintously paged—
form an annual volume.

This series was commenced in 1878, and now extends to nine annual _
volumes, averaging about 650 pages, and illustrated with numerous
wood-cut plates. Both these series of publications of the National
Museum have hitherto been printed at the expense of a fund under the
authority of the Interior Department; but it is proposed to ask for
legislation which will permit them to be printed at the Government
Printing Office on the requisition of your secretary.

The third and last series to be mentioned comprises the annual re-
ports of the Bureau of Ethnology, which are large-sized volumes of royal
octavo form, well printed and well illustrated with cuts and lithographic
plates. These volumes (of which four only have thus far been issued, but
of which the material for four more awaits the printer) present matter
of great interest to the anthropologist, and in their production reflect
credit upon the scientific staff of the Bureau of Ethnology.

Distribution of publications.—Since the diffusion of knowledge, next
to efforts for its increase, is one of the principal functions and duties of
the Institution, it would doubtless be desirable if we could offer a copy
of its works to every intelligent inquirer specially interested in any
subject of which some of these volumes might treat. Since, however,
the Institution can not afford to print, in ordinary cases, more than
from 1,250 to 1,500 copies of one work, three-fourths of which are required
to be supplied to our regular list of “ correspondents,” for the mainte-
nance of our exchange series, it has been found necessary to restrict the
gratuitous distribution to these, and to hold the small reserve, more
strictly than in earlier times, for sale to those sufficiently interested to
purchase them.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

The remarks made on this subject by the first secretary so long ago
as 1850, are no less pertinent to-day: ‘It must be evident that from the
small portjon of the income which can be devoted to this object the
distribution must be circumscribed. Fifteen hundred copies of each
memoir have been printed; but this number, though ail that the in-
come could furnish, has not been found sufficient to meet a tenth part
of the demand. It should be recollected that though these memoirs
consist of the results of new investigations of the highest importance to
the well-being of man in extending the bounds of his knowledge of the
universe of mind and matter of which he forms a part, yet they are not
in all cases of such a character as to be immediately appreciated by the
popular mind, and indeed they are better adapted to instruct the teacher
than to interest the general reader. They should therefore be dis-
tributed in such a way as most readily to meet the eye of those who
will make the best use of them in diffusing a knowledge of their con-
tents.”

That our present circulation, however, is placed on a liberal basis,
is sufficiently shown by the published conditions on which we are en-
abled still to offer them gratuitously. This distribution is made, first,
to those learned societies of the first class which give to the Institution
in return complete sets of their own publications. Secondly, to colleges
of the first class furnishing catalogues of their libraries and students,
and publications relative to their organization and history. Thirdly, to
public libraries in this country having twenty-five thousand volumes.
Fourthly, they are presented in some cases to still smaller libraries,
especially if no other copies of the Smithsonian publications are given
in the same place and a large district would be otherwise unsupplied.
Lastly, to institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion of particular
branches of knowledge, such of its publications are given as relate to
their special objects.

These rules apply chiefly to distribution in the United States. The
number sent to foreign countries, under somewhat different conditions,
is about the same as that distributed in this country.

Economy of publication demanded.—In view of the natural expansion
of the Smithsonian operations with advancing years, with its resources
fixed to a rigidly measured income which, as I have already observed,
isitself undergoing a slow depreciation in intrinsic value or actual pur-
chasing power, it would seem that some curtailment will be necessary
in the appropriations for preparing and printing the works that may be
offered. In looking to see in what direction this economy may be
most advantageously exercised it has seemed to me that a more critical
supervision over the series of ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collections” might be
adopted so as fo limit it to works of a more general interest or of
a higher scientific. value. This series already extending (as above
Stated) to thirty-three volumes, has included a number of the Museum
Bulletins and Proceedings as well as the proceedings of several scien-
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tific societies established in this city. In the infancy of the Philosoph-
ical, the Anthropological, and the Biological Societies of Washington,
this form of patronage appeared to be a very proper methéd of pro-
moting the increase and diffusion of knowledge. But now that these
societies are well established on a permanent basis, with a large mem-
bership for each, such a support appears to be less required. In like
manner the publications of the National Museum being provided for by
a Congressional appropriation, this Institution may well relinquish the
expense of any re-issue of them, while still employing its exchange
service for the gratuitous transmission of such copies of the “ Bulle-
tins” and * Proceedings” as may be intrusted to its care. Thus far
eight volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections have been occupied
with these issues, to wit: Volumes XIII, XIX, XXII, XXIII, and XXIV,
with the publications of the National Museum; and Volumes xx,
XXV, and XXxIII, with those of the societies named. I propose to
discard these from the series in the future and to make such other
restrictions aS may seem judicious under present conditions. In con-
nection with this I have had in mind the renewal of an experiment
made by your first secretary of placing (in certain exceptional cases)
the excess of copies beyond those regularly distributed, in the hands of
a publisher.

With regard to the quarto series of Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge there will probably be no occasion to suggest any change,
at least for the present.

THE SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGE SYSTEM.

The “ diffusion cf knowledge among men,” which, next to its ‘in-
crease,” is the reason for the existence of this Institution, has been, ever
since its foundation, largely carried out by means of the exchange sys-
tem, under which all knowledge, but especially new knowledge, as em-
bodied in scientific and other literature, is disseminated by the gratu-
itous efforts of the Smithsonian.

The system of-exchanges, even in its present condition, involved in
188687, the shipping of about ten thousand domestic and over forty
thousand foreign packages of books, and this has been increased to over
twelve thousand domestic and sixty-two thousand foreign packages by
the operations of the past year.

Before the writer’s connection with the Smithsonian Institution he
had abundant opportunity to know that the regard and confidence in
which it is held by all scientific men did not prevent a then general rec-
ognition of the fact that its exchange system did not work the benefits
contemplated, in that it took a time which ordinarily seemed excessive
to send a package toe Europe or to get one in return.

The writer having been assigned to the charge of exchanges on his
first connection with the Institution as Assistant Secretary, gave early
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. PA (

attention to this subject. The result of his investigation appears to
show that the reproach for delay was then well founded, but that the
blame did not lie at the door of the Institution, which did not, and does
not, possess the means to efficiently fulfill the tasks now imposed upon
it. He hopes some improvement has already been effected ; but much
doubtless remains to be done.

In the early period of the history of the exchanges nearly all trans-
portation was slow, but if it took the Smithsonian two or three months
to send a package to Europe and as much to bring it back, it took the
private individual the same time. The early steam-ship lines, then or a
little later, generously aided the Smithsonian plan by giving the ex-
changes free transportation, a privilege which the Institution has often
used, but now that rapid transportation is general, does not wish to
abuse by making a request that such companies should continue to
transport the whole of its greatly increased freight without charge.

There is another reason why they should not be requested to do so
in the fact that the character of the freight the exchange department
sends has changed, as the greater part of it is now the property of the
nation, and if the General Government desires this to go by rapid transit,
it is certainly able to pay for it. As Congress does not pay for rapid
transit, it is a reasonable conclusion that it does not desire it, but it
may be doubted whether either the extent of the actual use of the
Smithsonian exchanges by the Government or the degree of delay of
governmental business is understood.

To bring the facts in the case to mind let me reeall, first, that the
original exchange system commenced in 1846, and, second, that after
twenty years of useful work exclusively in the interests of knowledge,
an entirely new duty was imposed upon it by the act of March, 1867,
which established the International Exchange of Government Publica-
tions and made the Smithsonian Institution the agency for this ex-
change, giving it for distribution 50 copies of all documents printed
by order of either house of Congress, 50 additional copies of all docu-
ments printed in excess of the usual number, together with 50 of each
publication issued by any Department or Bureau of the Government ;
while the resolution of July 25, 1868, makes it obligatory upon the De-
partments to furnish 50 copies of each publication issued by them,
wherever printed.

Accordingly, of late years, there has been added to the primitive
Smithsonian exchange system and merged with it the additional feature
of carrying the Government’s exchanges.

The Institution possessed unequaled experience and facilities for
such work, and though the uew class of books brought to its exchange
department was partly foreign to its original object, the propriety of
its assuming such a service, if the Government’s interests could be pro-
moted by this experience, is evident. It certainly, however, was not
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to have been anticipated that the Institution should conduct a purely
administrative work for the General Government out of its private
funds, as it appears to have done for thirteen years from 1868 to 1881,
when the first appropriation of $3,000 was made by Congress.* If we
look back to the commencement of the Government system we find that
up to1880, inclusive, the Smithsonian had paid $92,386.29 for exchanges,
of which it is estimated that more than two-thirds were on Government
account, for which the Government paid nothing whatever. Subse-
quently to 1880, as the foot-note more exactly shows, the service has cost
$96,065.85, for which the Government has paid $57,500, leaving nearly
$30,000 of the cost to be borne by the Smithsonian Institution, and this
exclusive of the rent of the rooms, which represents about $3,000 a
year more.

All exchanges are now conducted by Government, but here ‘“‘ Govern-
mental” signifies all publications received from or for any bureau or office
of this or any Government, and ‘“ Miscellaneous” all others.+

It would appear that there is no doubt that in the intent of Congress,
as expressed in the act of 1881, these appropriations should now be ap-
plied indifferently to all exchanges, whether to those which it under-
takes for the Congressional publications, for those of governmental
bureaus, or for other literary and scientific objects ; but the amount as-

t Under the classification whieh has prevailed heretofore the publications passing
through the exchange office have been divided into ‘‘ official” and ‘literary and
scientific,” meaning by the former designation only the publications furnished by
the Public Printer for distribution among the national libraries of the Governments
participating in the international exchanges, and including in the latter aJl of the
publications sent or received by the bureaus of this Government in direct ex-
change with the bureaus of others, and for the benefit of the bureau libraries. The
classification appears to be misleading, since this latter subdivision of the exchanges
is quite as strictly official, or for the service of the Government, as the former. I
have therefore directed that hereafter all publications issued or received by the Gov-
ernment, whether by legislative, judicial, or Executive authority, shall be desig-
nated as “Governmental,” and all others as ‘‘ Miscellaneous.” ;
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

signed is inadequate for the proper conduct even of the former, as has
just been shown.*

Having been assigned to the charge of the international exchanges
when Assistant Secretary, the writer has always taken particular inter-
est in this part of the work of the Institution; but so far as its suecess
depends upon the provision by Congress of the indispensable means to
meet the expenses which it has just been shown that the Government
connection has made needful, his labors have been but partially sue-
cessful. The department of exchanges, however, has continued to be
the object of more than usual attention, first under the immediate care
of the writer, and iater under that of Dr. J. H. Kidder, appointed cura-
tor of laboratory and exchanges on the 19th of March, 1888.

Ithas been remarked that the present system is unsatisfactory because
of the delay involved, while it will shortly be shown that the expenses
of shipment by a prompt and efficiently conducted system would be sub-
stantially the same per ton of freight as by the present inefficient and slow
one, which is largely carried on by what might be called the charity of
the transportation lines. Unsatisfactory as is the service, however, and
necessarily conducted as it is (under the present appropriations) in a
manner prejudicial to every interest concerned with it, these appropria-
tions do not, as we have seen, meet all the inevitable expenditures, and
the deficiency still continues to be met from the proper funds of the
Institution.

The expense for the service for this fiscal year has been $15,113.75,
of which sum $12,000 were voted by Congress and $205.75 were re-
funded by the Patent Office, Signal Office, and a correspondent in
South America, leaving a net deficit of $2,908, paid by the Smithsonian
fund. In the coming fiscal year, at the present rate of expenditure,
the cost will be $16,050, making no allowance for the usual annual in-
crease in the quantity of business or for increased salaries of employés.
The domestic exchanges, it will be understood, form no part of this
estimate. Finally, it should be stated that nearly every department of
the Government has some small appropriation to partially cover serv-
ices which should be gratuitously rendered.

Recurring now to one of the effects of this insufficient appropriation,
the writer repeats that there are too many and too great delays in the
transit of packages sent by the international exchanges. These delays
do not occur in the office at Washington, nor in those of the agents of
the Institution at London and Leipzig. They are due, broadly speak-
ing, to the fact just stated that the Institution has not the means to

* The act approved in 1882 reads, ‘‘ For expenses of the international exchanges be-
tween the United States and foreign countries, in accordance with the Paris conven-
tion of 1877;” and this wording is repeated in 1883. Although the phrase referring
to the Paris convention was afterwards dropped from the law, there seems to be no
doubt that it has fixed its meaning, since the point has been raised more than once

by the accounting officers of the Treasu ry, and so decided.
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

pay for rapid transit on land or sea, and that for what it obtains on the
latter itis dependent upon the courtesy of several ocean steam-ship
companies, with the natural result that the free freight is often delayed
to make room for that which is paid for.* A subordinate cause, how-
ever, lies in the apathy or indifference, or possible insufficient clerical
force, of most of the foreign-exchange bureaus.

In a recent test case parcels shipped on the same day to London,
Leipzig, and Paris, with letters requesting immediate notification of
receipt, were acknowledged by the agents of the Institution at London
on the fourteenth day, at Leipzig on the fifteenth, and by the Bureau
des Echanges at Paris on the fortieth day.

In the hope of insuring a regular and certain ocean-steamer service,
I requested, on the 30th of May last, through the honorable Secretary
of the Treasury, an increase in the appropriation for the fiscal year
1888—89 to $27,050, based upon a careful consideration of the cost of
“fast freight” at the ordinary commercial rates and upon the quantity
of material which past experience has made probable.

The following brief statement wil. give the essential facts on which
the application was based.

It should be premised that only about one-third of the Government’s
publications are actually received from the office of the Public Printer
and elsewhere, for transmission abroad, and that while special appli-
cation on our part might call out the remainder, we can not under-
take to do this while only partly paid the actual outlay for the portion
we carry already, while a sufficient appropriation to justify the employ-
ment of a special exchange agent in Europe, as has been frequently and
earnestly recommended by the Librarian of Congress, would bring back
in return probably about eight times what we now receive. Accord-
ingly, in the subjoined estimate of what should be done, if Congress
paid the actual cost of efficient service (the services of the officers of
this Institution being given without charge), more packages appear
under the new plan than under the old.

*A shipment sent from Rome in December, 1887, for example, lay at Naples until
the latter part of March, 1888, before the steam-ship company forwarded it.

The following memorandum appears in the Congressional Record of
July 29, 1888, page 7666, and contains the leading facts in a succinet
form:

* International Exchanges.—Present system established by resolution
of Congress approved March 2, 1867, and by subsequent legislation.
Fifty copies of all Government publications put at disposal of Commit-
tee on Library for international exchange.

Uniform system agreed upon at international geographical conference,
Paris, 1875, and modified by conferences for this particular purpose at
Brussels in 1880, 1883, and 1886. Treaty now before Senate is the re-
sult of these conferences. There is now no completed treaty obligation.
England, Germany, and France have declined to ratify the treaty, and
were not represented at the last conference.

The Smithsonian is not concerned with the system otherwise than as
the agent of the Government, but has paid a material part of the cost
annually from its private fund.

As the office is now organized the annual expenditure is at the fol-
lowing rates:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 393

This means ‘slow’ freight, and for the most part gratuitous, on the
ocean. Theaverage time for transmission of a parcel to western Europe
is now thirty-six days. By ordinary fast freight it could be reduced to
sixteen days. Extraordinary delays occur frequently because of the
fact that the freight is carried gratuitously. Boxes shipped from Rome,
for example, in December last were held in Naples three months by the
steam-ship line because its steamer’s space was all filled by paying
freight. The same thing has occurred frequently on this side of the
ocean. As at present organized, the Smithsonian sends out about one-
third of the United States Government publications, and receives from
foreign governments less than one-tenth of their official publications,
Very much is thus lost which is of great interest and value to our Goy-
ernment offices.

Many of the Executive Departments which wish to use the exchange
system are obliged to adopt other measures at considerably increased
cost. Some of them have special appropriations to defray part of the

cost of special transmissions by the Smithsonian.

The sum estimated tor ($27,050), is the result of careful calculation,
based upon a comparison of the details of the business for several years
back. It is the Secretary’s opinion that it will far more than repay it-
self by an increased efficiency in the service and by the number of val-
uable works which it will bring to Congress and the Executive Depart-
ments of the Government.”

f am aware that it hardly lies within the power of the Regents as a
body to correct the evils I have referred to, but I present this summary
and imperfect statement of them, in the hope that those of the Regents
who are legislators will perhaps be able and willing, in their individual
capacity, to do something to remedy the state of things which I have
just shown to be actually existing.

I have represented a wearisome and trying matter very briefly. For
a statement more at large of the actual condition of the exchanges, I
beg to refer to the valuable report made to the Secretary by theecurator
of exchanges, which will be found in the appendix.

Preparation of new exchange lists.—In March, 1887, the writer, then
Assistant Secretary, acting under the general instructions of the Seere-
tary, Professor Baird, with a view to perfecting the collections of the
Smithsonian Library so that they might include scientific periodicals
published throughout the world, where these were obtainable by ex-
change, undertook to ascertain as far as possible the names of all useful
(particularly of all modern) publications which were not on the old
Smithsonian lists. ;

To do this it was necessary to get information not existing in print,
and as the search for the names of desired publications was necessarily
on an extended scale, it seemed proper to enlist as many expert coad.
jutors as possible. To this end the principal branches of human
knowledge to the number of thirty were indexed on as many separate
lists. Several copies were made of each list, and then it was sought,
by sending a copy of each to an eminent specialist in the branch in

H. Mis. 142 3

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

question, to enlist his services as a coadjutor by obtaining from him
a list of the publications not actually on our records which would be
most desirable in his own department.

Medicine was omitted, but Belles Lettres, History, Law, Fine Arts,
and, in fact, Theology are evidently to be considered even in a purely
scientific list, at least so far as they illustrate anthropology.

Periodicals devoted to science in its more restricted interpretation
generally fall under one of two great divisions :

First, those connected with the biological, and second, those connected
with the physical, sciences.

As the former are represented by many distinguished specialists
connected with the Smithsonian Institution as curators in the Museum
there was at first prepared a circular letter (Appendix IV) to these bio-
logical curators, requesting them to furnish—

(1) ‘A list of those periodicals, whether transactions of societies or
otherwise, which were deemed most nearly indispensable to their re-
spective departments ; ” and

(2) “A list of recent serials, whether transactions or otherwise, of
interest in connection with the special investigations of the curators,
even if not exclusively devoted to them.”

Pending the replies, which related almost altogether to biology, the
writer himself prepared a list of the main divisions and subdivisions of
physical science meant, with the preceding exceptions, to represent
every department of knowledge outside of the biological sciences.

This list was submitted in April to Professors F. A. P. Barnard,
Samuel H. Scudder, and H. Carrington Bolton, with the requests—

First. ‘To examine the list and see whether these headings them-
selves are judiciously chosen; ” and

Next. ‘To indicate the names of the two most fitting persons, under
each head, to give advice as to the periodicals belonging to their re-
spective departments.” The list was also submitted to the Hon. A. R.
Spoftord, Librarian of Congress, and Mr. William J. Rhees, the Chief
Clerk of the Smithsonian Institution.

A full list of the names of eminent specialists who could advise in each
branch having been thus obtained, and the classification of subjects
having been determined in the manner above indicated, circular letters
(in three forms) were forwarded on the 9th of May, 1887. <A third or
supplementary circular (in two forms) was mailed on the 15th of June,
1887. One of these, which willi ndicate the general character of all, is
given in Appendix LV.

The cireular letter of March 19, sent to twenty-six curators of the Na-
tional Museum, was responded to by twenty-two curators, among whom
Prof. L. F. Ward was pre-eminent for the extent and character of the
lists of periodicals specified (352 titles).

Of the circulars of May 9 and June 15, 1887, 274 copies were sent out

The result of the inquiry was to bring in 5,730 names, of which, after
deducting those found on more than one list, 3,594 independent titles
remain; but of these, as will appear, a considerable portion was on our
list already. It may be interesting, however, to notice how these titles
are distributed throughout the world, the little tables in the foot-note*
giving incidentally an interesting exposition of the activities of different
peoples as well as of different professions in this direction.

articles) are found to reach the enormous number of 3,594; and yet
these by no means comprise, as it will be seen, all that the Smithsonian
lists contain.

Five thousand seven hundred and thirty names were in fact received,
but many of these were duplicates, after striking out which, 3,594 titles
remain, and a careful investigation by Mr. Boehmer, then in charge of
exchanges, shows that of these, 2,328 were foreign, and 1,266 were
domestic; and that of the foreign titles but 792 were on our old lists.
As regards these latter, then, the final result of the inquiry is the nearly
trebling of our foreign lists by adding to them 1,536 new titles (con-
sisting largely of periodicals begun in the past twelve or fifteen years),
and this list will be used by the library in obtaining, so far as possible,
the periodicals themselves.

LIBRARY.

Chiefly through its exchange system, the Smithsonian had in 1865
accumulated about forty thousand volumes, largely publications of
learned societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the
world in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of
the human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of at
least every branch of positive science since the days of revival of let-
ters until the present time.*

These books, in many cases presents from old European libraries,
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best
collections of the kind in the world.

The danger incurred from the fire of that year, and the fact that the
greater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into in-
sufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to
be incurred for this binding, enlarged room, and other purposes con-
nected with their use threatened to grow beyond the means of the In-
stitution, appear to have been the moving causes which determined the
Regents to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place the
Smithsonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the right of
the Regents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of binding,
etc. Owing to the same causes (which have affected the Library of
Congress itself) these principal conditions, except as regards their
custody in a fire proof building, have never been fulfilled.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they
have now accumulated from 40,000 to fully 250,000 volumes and parts
of volumes, and form without doubt the most valuable collection of the
kind in existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more
crowded and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer.
It is hardly necessary to add that these facts are deplored by no one
more than by the present efficient Librarian of Congress, who would, I
am confident, gladly give, as far as it lies in his power, effect to any ex-

*See Smithsorian Report of 1867.
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

pression of the wish of the Regents that in the new building a hall or
halls worthy of this really magnificent collection of a quarter of a mill-
ion titles should be exclusively devoted to it, under the name of the
‘Smithsonian Halls”, or in any such other method as may point it out
as an acquisition of national importance due to the Institution under
the Regents’ care.

It will be remembered that a small portion of these volumes, repre-
senting in number something like one-twentieth of the whole, is ordi-
narily retained for consultation in the National Museum.

A certain limited number of books, chiefly of works of reference,
obtained by purchase from the Smithsonian fund, is kept in the Smith-
sonian building, under the titles of “The Secretary’s Library” and
‘ Wditor’s Library.”

With these exceptions, it will be understood that a large part of the
Smithsonian exchange system, and a considerable portion of the best
rooms in the main building of the Smithsonian, continue to be given to
this portion of the Library of Congress without any return.

On April 1, 1887, upon the resignation of Miss J. A. Turner, who had
for many years performed the duties of librarian with the greatest dili-
gence and faithfulness, the provisions for the care of the books supplied
to the Congressional Library were reorganized under the regulations
which I had prepared upon my appointment as assistant secretary.*
Mr. John Murdoch, formerly assistant librarian in the National Mu-
seum, was appointed librarian in Miss ‘Turner’s place, and was also
given the charge of the collection of books kept in the Museum as a
working library for the use of the curators and other officers.

A force of three clerks was detailed to report to the librarian, in
order to enable him to carry out the new regulations, which require
greater promptness in disposing of accessions than it was possible to
effect when one person alone was employed on this work. All acces.
sions received during any week must now be completely recorded and
ready for a final disposition to be made of them on the Saturday of the
same week. All accessions, as heretofore, except the comparatively
few retained for use at the Institution, and certain medical publications
which are specially loaned to the library of the Surgeon-General’s Office,
U.S. Army, are sent to the Library of Congress.

Publications retained for the use of the Institution must, under the
regulations, be entered and ready for use within twenty-four hours
from the time they are received.

A “full entry” of any publication, according to the regulations, is
“to consist of both a day-book and a ledger account entry.”

The day-book is simply a continuation of the old Smithsonian record
of accessions, in which the running numbers reached on June 30, 1888,
182,059. The ledger account is supplementary to the manuscript cata-
logue in thirteen large bound volumes, called ‘** Publications of Learned

* These regulations are given in n Appendix Vv.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

Societies, Periodicals, ete., in the Library of the Smithsonian Institu
tion,” which was complete up to April i, 1587. The new record is kept
on large cards, one for each institution or individual from whom the In-
stitution has received any publication, and on each card is entered the
title of everything received from the person or institution whose name
appears at the head of the card, each marked with its aecession or
‘‘day-book” number, by means of which reference can be made to the
“day-book” for further particulars. These cards are now arranged
alphabetically by the name of the donor’s residence.

These regulations have been carried out without failure since the re-
organization of the library, though there have been weeks when, owing
to the arrival of large invoices through the department of foreign ex-
changes, the librarian and his clerks have been hard pressed to com-
plete the work in the time specified. Upwards of five hundred acces-
sions have been recorded in a single week.

The books destined for the Library of Congress are sent regularly on
Monday of each week, and it is impossible for publications to be delayed
at the Institution for the length of time which was frequently unavoid-
able under the former arrangements. It is, however, to be regretted
that the Librarian of Congress is unable to take advantage of the in-
creased promptness of the Smithsonian library administration. Owing,
as I am informed, to the pressure of copyright work and the over-
crowded condition of the present quarters of the Library, the chests
sent up from the Institution frequently lie for months unopencd, so that
their contents are inaccessible to readers.

This is the more to be regretted as, on account of the limited space
at the disposal of the Institution for keeping books and periodicals, only
the most important publications can be retained for use here.

The books thus retained for use at the Institution form part of the
National Museum library (the rest of which consists of such publica-
tions as are donated directly to the Museum or purchased from the
Museum appropriation for the use of its curators), and are loaned under
certain necessary conditions to the officers of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the Smithsonian editor, the scientific staff of the Museum, and
such persons as are authorized to borrow books by special written per-
mission from one of the officers of the Smithsonian Institution.

How important these contributions from the Smithsonian accessions
are to the Museum library may be seen from the faet that out of the
6,053 accessions to the Museum library (including parts of regular
serials) during the fiscal year, 5,045, or a trifle more than 50 per cent.,
were from this source.

From lack of space in the Museum library it had been practically
impossible to provide for the proper display of new accessions to the
library, and especially of the current numbers of periodicals. At my
- direction, therefore, the librarian prepared plans for a reading-room in
the Smithsonian Building. This room was opened to readers in the-
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

latter part of April, 1887, and has remained in active use since then
It now contains the current numbers of two hundred and sixty-five se-
rials, embracing most of the chief scientific and technical publications,
and including also a few of the more important literary periodicals. It
is much used by the employés of the Smithsonian Institution and the
Museum, and to a less degree by other persons in Washington who
wish to consult the scientific periodicals. Such a scientific reading-
room has long been needed at the Institution, and the one now in opera-
tion appears to fill the want satisfactorily.

The policy that has been pursued in regard to the library has been,
in general, to obtain as large and as valuable a return as possible for
the works published by the Institution, and to make the best possible
use of these returns when they are received. With this end in view,
the librarian has been instructed to watch for all opportunities of ob-
taining new publications by exchange and to bring to my knowledge
every occasion of this kind. The results of this increased activity in
seeking new exchanges are to be seen in the fact that for the fiscal year
188788 the total number of accessions amounted to 18,948, an increase
of 2,401 over the total number for the preceding fiscal year (1886—87),
which was 16,547.

As has been previously stated, 3,045 of these accessions have been
transferred to the Museum library, and, in addition to these, 675 med-
ical dissertations have been loaned to the library of the Surgeon-Gen-
eral’s Office, U.S. Army. The remainder, 15,228 in number, have been
transferred to the Library of Congress. It is impossible, as it seems to
me, not to consider this as an ample return for whatever expense the
Library of Congress is put to in paying for the recording of these acces-
sions. :

ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Collections of living Animals.—it has been customary, ever since the
Institution commenced to form collections, that skeletons and skins of
wild animals should be sent here for preparation, so that a certain reg-
ular supply of such material now comes in without solicitation every
year, together with occasional live animals, which have been usually
sent to the Zoological Gardens in Philadelphia. It seemed to me worth
while to try the experiment of having all animals sent on alive when
this could be done without enhanced cost; and thus has been formed
the nucleus of a collection of living animals, which, though still small,
has attracted the popular interest in a very marked degree.

It is understood that this interest, and the consideration that the
buffalo, the mountain sheep and goat, the elk, and other vanishing races
of the continent deserve protection at the hands of the Government,
was the cause of a bill which was introduced by Senator Beck to create
a Zoological Garden on Rock Creek, such that these animals might not
only form the subject of study, but be expected to increase as they do
not do inordinary captivity.

I present herewith the amendment to the sundry civil appropriation
bill reported by Senator Morrill, of the Committee on Public Buildings
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

and Grounds, June 4, 1888. This is identical with the bill proposed by

,

Senator Beck April 25, 1885 (S. 2752), which was read twice and re-
ferred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds with the ad-
ditions of the paragraphs inclosed in brackets.

This establishment it is proposed, when completed, to place under
the care of the Regents, with a proper provision for its maintenance.
The bill has not yet become a law, but in the event of its doing so, the
trust created, being in the interest of knowledge, and incidentally offer-
ing amost obvious means for its popular diffusion, seems to be one which
falls entirely within the proper function of the Smithsonian Institution,
and I hope I may beable to state that the trust is one of a nature which
the Regents, if called upon, are likely to favor.

[A BILL for the establishment of a zoological park in the District of Columbia. ]

That, in order to establish a Zoological Park in the District of Colum-
bia, for the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of
the people, a commission shall be constituted, composed of three persons,
namely: the Secretary of the Interior, the president of the board of
Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, which shall be known and designated as the
commission for the establishment of a zoological park.

That the said commission is hereby authorized and directed to make
an inspection of the country along Rock Creek, beginning at the point
on that creek where the Woodley road crosses said creek, and extend.
ing upward along its course to where said creek is crossed by the
Klingle road, and to select from that district of country such a tract of
land, of not more than one hundred acres, which shall include a section
of the creek, as said commission shall deem to be suitable and appro-
priate for a zoological park.

That the said commission shall cause to be made a careful map of said
zoological park, showing the location, quantity, and character of each
parcel of private property to be taken for such purpose, with the names
of the respective owners inscribed thereon, and the said map shall be
filed and recorded in the public records of the District of Columbia;
and from and after that date the several tracts and parcels of land em-
braced in such zoological park shall be held as condemned for public
uses, Subject to the payment of just compensation, to be determined by
the said commission and approved by the President of the United
States, provided that such compensation be accepted by the owner or
owners of the several parcels of land.

That if the said commission shall be unable to purchase any portion
of the land so selected and condemned within thirty days after such

That when the said commission shall have established a zoological
park in the District of Columbia under the provisions of this act, by ac-
quiring the necessary lands and by laying out the same as a park and
by the erection of the necessary buildings, thereupon it shall be the
duty of said commission to turn over the said zoological park, with all
its buildings and appurtenances, to the custody and care of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution ; and when such transfer of the custody
and care of the zoological park shall be made, the duties of said com-
mission shall cease and its existence terminate.

That when the said commission shall tender to the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution the care and custody of the zoological park pro-
vided for in this act, the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are
hereby authorized to assume the care and custody of the same; and
the said Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are hereby authorized
to make such rules and regulations for the management of the park,
and of the property, appurtenances, and collections of the park, as they
may deem necessary and wise to secure the use of the same for the ad-
yancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people.

[That the said commission is hereby authorized to call upon the Di-
rector of the Geological Survey to make such surveys as may be neces-
sary to carry into effect the provisions of this act; and the Director of
the Geological Survey is hereby authorized and required to make such
surveys under the direction of said commission. |

I will take this occasion to observe that we have found great liberal-
ity in the donors of specimens. Among those to whom we are especially
indebted is the Hon. Eugene G. Blackford, commissioner of fisheries
for the State of New York, and an old and valued supporter of the
work of the Institution, who has presented us with two buffaloes, an
animal now become so rare as to have a high money value.

The proposition for the establishment of a National Zoological Park

has met with a very surprising amount of support from all parts of the
United States.*

*'The followi ing e extract from ‘Public Opinion ” will serve to give somewhat of an
idea of the character and extent of this support:

[Public Opinion, New York.]

The National Zoological Park.—Of all the bills that have been introduced in Con-
gress this session, no other has been more universally approved by the press than
Senator Beck’s bill for the establishment of a National Zoological Park at Washing-
ton, on a grand and liberal scale, ‘‘ for the advancement of science and the instruc-
tion and recreation of the people.” With all our great game animals being swept
out of existence by modern breech-loaders, a magnificent site within 2 miles of the
Executive Mansion, a huge surplus in the Treasury, gifts of live animals pouring into

ART AND MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS,

Art collections.—The words of your first secretary, that the Institution
»xists for knowledge in the highest seise, including not only science
commonly so called, bit “the trie, the beaiitifttl; as Well as the immedi-
ately practical,” remind us that one of the lines on which the Lnstitiitioil
was to develop according to the views of Congress, that of its counec-
tion with art, has been allowed almost entirely to lapse. It is now, how-
ever, understood that a very valuable collection of art objects, repre-
senting, perhaps, over $1,000,000 in value, has been left to the Smith-
sonian Institution; and it is not an abstract question when we ask
what these relations are to be. It seems to me that here again‘the fact
of the independence of the Smithsonian is of inestimable value in its
possible future usefulness. No possessor of a great private gallery like
either of the two or three in this country which are rising now to al-
most national importance—no possessor of such a gallery, Knowing on
the one hand what art is and on the other hand what the relations of
the Government to art have been in the past, is likely to bequeath it
to the nation without some guaranty, not only for its care and mainte-
nance, but for its judicious use in the cause of national art itself.

the Smithsonian, the public clamoring for a National ‘‘ Zoo,” and a competent natu-
ralist ready and anxious te build it up, what reason is there why the bill should not
be passed and work begun at ‘once? If it is neglected much longer some of our
grandest game species will have become so nearly extinct it will be almost, if not
quite, impossible to procure living representatives of them at any price. At the rate
mountain goats are now being killed off for their pelts five years hence it will be im-
possible to procure a living specimen. A live buffalo is now worth from $500 to
$1,000, according te sex and size, whereas three or four years ago they were worth
only one-fifth as much. Asan index to public sentiment in regard to the proposed zo-
ologizal patk at Washington, we may quote a few editorial expressions from our ex-
changes. It 1s interesting to note the unanimity of the opiniens that come to us in
journals of all kinds and parties, from Boston to San Franciscv. The Boston Globe
exclaims: ‘“‘Give us a National Zoo. Senator Beck has introduced a bill of great in-
terest to the people of the United States, concerning which there can be no partisan
difference of opinion, and which ought to be passed. This is the only great nation
in the world which does not possess such an institution, and if is the one of all others
which needs it most. A national museum of living animals would be one of the
leading attractions of Washington, and would show the citizen and foreign visitor at
a glance the animals of this country as they could never be seen otherwise. By all
means let this country have aNational ‘Zoo.’ Senator Beck’s bill ought to pass.”
The Pittsburgh Dispatch declares that the bill “should meet with the hearty in-
dorsement it deserves. That a nation so far in advance in the march of progress as
the United States should be entirely without some such institution under Goy-
ernment protection seems almost incredible.” The Ncw York Forest and Stream
asserts that ‘‘ the importance of preserving living North American mammals can
hardly be overestimated. The buffalo is practically extinct, and the range of the
. elk has become so contracted in the last few years that it is apparent the same
fate awaits that noble species. There are others that will survive longer, but the
people at large know nothing, and never can know, about them, unless they shall be
brought close to their homes. All these animals should be secured before it is too
late.” The Chicago Inter-Ocean, in a lengthy and very earnest editorial on this sub-
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Smithsonian stands here in the position of a disinterested and
independent party, absolutely responsible, having a permanency such
as no individual or private corporation can represent, and it might very
well, if seems to me, in pursuit of its proper objects accept a trust of
this kind on the condition either of seeing itself that the Government
accepted it and provided for it in a proper way or handing it back to the
heirs of the conditional donor. It is perhaps not too much to say that
an important function of the Smithsonian which has lain long in whey-
ance may yet be developed in this direction.

Assignment of rooms for scientific work.—During the past year the use
of rooms in the Smithsonian building has been granted to the Director
of the Geological Survey for draughtsmen ; to the Coast and Geodetic
Survey for pendulum experiments under the direction of Assistant C. 8S.
Peirce; to the Fish Commission, during the commissionership of Dr.
Goode for the sessions of a committee for revising the work and organi-
zation of the Commission, and for the storage of the stereotype plates of
its publications.

Rooms and facilities for work have also been granted to Dr. J. F.
Bransford, surgeon, U. 8. Navy, for the preparation of a report on the

ject, dwells with special emphasis on the fact that ‘if the Government purchases
and fits up a park or extensive gardens there will not be the slightest difficulty in ob-
taining suitable inhabitants. No better illustration need be cited than the menagerie
at the Smithsonian. Nearly all the really valuable animals there have been pre-
sented to it. The zoo in London, the gardens in Paris, the parks in the cities of the
United States, not the least of which are those of Chicago, set forth, with pointed
object-lessons, the value and interest these zoological exhibitions possess. <A great
garden at the national capital could, on the plan proposed, be made one of the most
interesting and instructive of public resorts.” The Minneapolis Journal Sgys with
confidence that “inasmuch as the expense would be comparatively trifling under the
management of that object of national pride, the Smithsonian, there is every reason
to expect that the project will meet the approval of Congress.” The San Francisco
Call earnestly advocates the measure as one of interest to the entire American peo-
ple. Itsays: ‘‘That such a park would be of advantage ‘for the advancement of
science and the instruction and the recreation of the people’ needs no demonstration,
It would be a national benefit, as similar gardens have proved themselves to be in
other countries. But there are peculiar reasons for establishing an American zoo.
The original wild animals of this country are being rapidly exterminated. The
American bison, better known as the buffalo, is almost extinct. There are a few ina
remote corner of ‘'exas, and afew still survive in the Yellowstone Park. But if
nothing is done to preserve them, in a few years they will have disappeared as com-
pletely as the pterodactyl. A few moose can still be found in northern New York
and Maine; there are still a few specimens of the mountain sheep and goat in the
mountains of Colorado; an occasional caribou is stil] shot in the Adirondacks; aherd
of antelope is still seen, once in the way, on the prairies; a few grizzlies survive in
the Rocky Mountains, b ut hunters know to their sorrow that these creatures, once so
plentiful, are growing scarcer every year, and will soon have vanished altogether.
The traveler on the eastern slopes of the Rockies finds plenty of beaver dams, but few
beavers, and the mountain lion is almost « thing of the past. To find a complete
collection of the wild beasts which once roamed in freedom over the mountain slopes
and the prairies one must now go to the northern section of the Dominion of Canada,

- Toner Lecture. Fund.—The Secretary of the Institution is ex-officio
chairman of the board of trustees. No lectures have been delivered
for several years. The fund remains as originally invested, increased
annually by the unexpended income. It consists partly in real estate
in Washington, 4nd partly in Government bonds, the estimated value
of which is about $3,000.

American Historical Association.—A. bill was introduced in the Senate
by Hon. G. I’. Hoar on the 21st of May, 1888, and in the House on the
4th of June by Hon. James Phelan, to incorporate the ‘American His-
torical Association,” and as the bill proposes an intimate connection
between the association and the Smithsonian Institution it is here given
in full:

[A BILL to incorporate the American Historical Association. ]

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That Andrew D. White, of
Ithaca, in the State of New York; George Bancroft, of Washington, in
the District of Columbia; Justin Winsor, of Cambridge, in the State of
Massachusetts; William F. Poole, of Chicago, in the State of Illinois;
Herbert B. Adams, of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland; Clarence W.
Bowen, of Brooklyn, in the State of New York, their associates and suc-
cessors, are hereby created a body corporate and politic, by the name of
the American [listorical Association, for the promotion of historical
studies, the collection and preservation of historical manuscripts, and
for kindred purposes in the interest of American history and of history
in America. Said association is authorized to hold real and personal
estate to an amount not exceeding five hundred thousand dollars, to
adopt a constitution, and to make by-laws. Said association shall have
its headquarters at Washington, in the District of Columbia, and shall
hold its annual meetings in such places as the said incorporators shall
determine. Said association shall report annually to the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution concerning its proceedings and the condi-
tion of historical study in America. Said Secretary shall communicate
to Congress the whole of sueh reports, or such portion thereof as he
shall see fit. The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are authorized
to permit said association to deposit its collections, manuscripts, books,
pamphlets, and other material for history in the Smithsonian Institution
or in the National Museum, at their discretion, upon such conditions
and under such rules as they shall prescribe.

Highth centenary of the University of Bologna.—In accordance with the
request of Prof. J. Capellini, rector of the University of Bologna, the
Smithsonian Institution appointed two representatives to be present at
the eighth centenary of the university, which occurred on the 12th of
June, 1888. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, and Dr. C, Gardini,
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

United States consul at Bologna, were appointed. A letter from Doce-
tor Mitchell is herewith appended:

To the REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION:

GENTLEMEN: As representing the Institution over which you preside
I went to Bologna, and was present at the eight hundredth anniversary
of its famous university. The ceremonies consisted in addresses and a
poem by Professor Carducci, with presentations to the King and Queen,
and with the conferring of degrees in law, letters, science, and med-
icine. Mr, James Russell Lowell was thus honored in letters, Mr. David
Dudley Field in law, Alexander Agassiz in science, and myself in med-
icine. The ‘ Laureati” were not given LL.D.’s but were made doctors
in their respective branches; amore sensible plan. I shall send a medal
and the volumes presented to me, that of these you may make such dis-
posal as seem best.

And I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
WEIR MITCHELL.

Grants and subscriptions.—In accordance with a precedent established
by the first Secretary to encourage meritorious scientific enterprises
undertaken wholly for the advance of knowledge and not for pecuniary
gain, a subscription of twenty copies was made for the Astronomical
Journal of Dr. B. A. Gould, published at Boston.

Privilege of floor of the House of Kepresentatives.—A resolution having
been introduced in the House of Representatives ou the 6th of February,
1858, to admit to the privileges of the floor certain officials of the Goy-
ernment, Hon. Mr. Cox, of New York, one of the Regents, introduced a
resolution, which was referred to the Committee on Rules, to confer the
privilege on the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

It is proper to state that for many years this privilege has been ex-
tended to the Secretary by the Senate of the United States.

Reception.—It was the habit of the first Secretary, when he resided in
the Smithsonian building, to give receptions there from time to time,
which many still pleasantly remember. It is, perhaps, proper for the
writer to mention that though these rooms are now devoted to official pur-
poses he, desiring that the traditions of this kindly hospitality should
not entirely lapse, used them on the 17th of April of the present year
on an occasion, which, so far as he was able to make it so, was not dis-
similar in kind to the former ones in the same place, and which he has
reason to hope will be pleasantly associated with them in the recollec-
tions of old friends of the Institution.

Employés of the Institution—Few changes have occurred in the cleri-
cal force. Owing to the independence of the Smithsonian Institution of
those alterations which take place with changes of administration in
Government Departments, the tenure of office of all its employés is
_ Justly regarded as more secure than in other public establishments ;
and acceptable persons are commonly found willing to take employment
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

under the Regents on lower terms than the same nominal service is
elsewhere paid for by the Government. At the same time with this
fixity of tenure and permanence of position, closer and perhaps kindlier
relations are found to arise than exist else where in the midst of frequent
change; and the writer is happy to believe that the best and most val-
uable part of this service is often an unbought and voluntary one, and
that this is recognized by both employer and employed.

U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The relations of the Museum to the Smithsonian Institution have so
frequently been discussed, that itis unnecessary to dwell upon them at
the present time. The connection of the Museum with the present
establishment has not only always been very much more intimate than
that of many of the other undertakings which were projected at the time
of the foundation of the Institution, but as has already been observed,
it rests on a radically distinct footing from any other, since the Smith-
sonian Institution has actual property in the Museum, equalling probably
its whole original fund. Through the agency of the Museum the Insti-
tution is able to direct the work of a goodly number of investigators, who,
in addition to their regular administrative work, are doing each year im.
portant service in the increase and diffusion of knowledge. In fact so
much is done in the name of the Institution by the officers of the Museum
and the Bureau of Ethnology in all the fields of biological, anthropologi-
cal, and geological work, that the Institution can devote a larger pro-
portion of its own funds tothe encouragement of investigation in phys-
ical sciences than it could were not the biological sciences thus well
provided for.

The statement of the work of the year in the Museum some years
since became so great in extent that it was found necessary to add a
second volume to the Smithsonian Report to contain it. Referring then
to the report of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the assistant secretary in charge
of the Museum, for a history of the work as performed in its various
departments, I need here refer only to some of the most important gen-
eral considerations.

Prominent among these are the financial relations of the Museum to
the Smithsonian and to the General Government, and the changes ob-
tained by legislation in the past year, with regard to placing the appro-
priations more immediately under the care of the Regents, but these I
have already spoken of under the head of “‘ Finance.”

During the past year a committee appointed by me to investigate the
Sanitary condition of the present Museum structure, has reported in
urgent terms on the need in the interest of health, of very great changes
such as can not be undertaken till another building exists to receive
the present personnel, the collections, and the public during the changes,

H. Mis. 142 4

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Through the agency of one of your body this is likely to be provided,
The particulars have already been stated under the subject of “Building.”

I may add in this connection that the present Museum building is
not more than large enough for the ethnological and technological
material already available. The proposed new building will afford ac-
cominodation for the natural history collections which are at present
very inadequately housed. Tor instance, the amount of space assigned
to the collection of mammalsis about 6,500 feet. At least double that
amount of space will be needed to accommodate the material now on
hand, as soon as the taxidermists of the Museum shall have been able
to prepare it for exhibition, it being our desire to have mounted groups,
similar to the buffalo family recently finished, in order to preserve for
future generations representations of the Jarge quadrupeds native to
this continent, which are on the verge of extinction.

At the close of the last fiscal year (June 30, 1887), a very careful esti-
mate showed that the collections were about fifteen times as great in
number of specimens as in the year 1882. I desire to call your attention
especially to the inclosed statement bearing upon this point.

The Museum is growing, as it is fitting that the National Museum of
a great country should grow; and it is not only necessary to care for
what is already here, but to provide for the reception and display of
what is certain to be placed in vur hands within the next few years.

Since the erection of the present Museum building there have been
more than 12,000 groups or lots of specimens added to the collection,
chiefly by gifts. From the year 1859 to 1880 the accessions numbered
8,475. It is thus evident that within the last eight years the number
of accessions has been half as large again as during the previous twenty-
one.

Many of the more recent accessions are of very great extent, as for
instance the bequest of the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, which con
tains 20,000 specimens of shells, besides minerals and other objects ;
the Jeffreys collection of fossil and recent shells of EKurope, including
40,000 specimens; the Stearns collections of mollusks, numbering 100,000
specimens; the Riley collection of insects, containing 150,000 specimens;
the Catlin collection of Indian paintings, about 500 in number; the col-
lection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transpor-
tation of which to Washington several freight-cars were required.

There are also the extensive collections obtained at the Fisheries
Exhibition at Berlin and London and at the close of the New Orleans
Cotton Centennial; the Shepard collection of meteorites; the Wilson
collection of archeological objects (more than 12,0,0 specimens); the
Lorrillard collection of Central American antiquities, and very many
others nearly as extensive. In addition to these are the annual accre-
tions from the work of the U.S. Fish Commission, the U.S. Geological
Survey, and the Bureau of Ethnology, as well as the contributions from
several expeditions of the Government, from Army and Navy officers,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

and from other Government officials. These are very extensive, and
are yearly increasing in bulk and value.

In the Armory building are stored many hundreds of boxes of valu-
able material which we have not room to unpack, and the great vaults
under the Smithsonian building and many of the attic and tower rooms
are Similarly occupied.

For several important departments of the Museum no exhibition
space whatever is available, and no portion of the collection can be
publicly displayed. Indeed, the growth of many of the departments is
in large measure prevented by the fact that we have no room for addi-
tional exhibition cases, or even for storage. Many valuable collections
elsewhere than in Washington are at the service of the Museum, but
we have no space for their reception.

The collection of birds, which, so far as North America is concerned,
is the finest in the world, is very inadequately shown, and requires
double the case room now available.

The collection of mollusks, which is one of the most complete in the
world and contains more than 450,000 specimens, is at present almost
entirely unprovided for.

The collection of insects, which, though smaller, is, so far as North
America is concerned, equally perfect, is also practically without any
exhibition space. And so I might continue.

It should be borne in mind that under the roofs of the Smithsonian
and new Museum buildings are grouped together collections which in
London, Paris, or any other of the Kuropean capitals, are provided for
in a group of museums, for the accommodation of which a much larger
number of equally commodious buildings is found needful.

One of the most striking features in connection with the affairs of
the Museum is the remarkable increase in the extent of its collections,
which each year becomes greater. This increase is in a large degree
spontaneous, only a very small sum of money being available for the
purchase of new material. As might be supposed, a considerable pro-
portion of the objects given duplicate material already on hand, and
although these contributions can, with the utmost advantage, be used
for distribution to other museums and schools, they do not increase as
much as is desired the value of the collections for study by specialists,
and for general educational purposes. The need of a larger fund for
the purchase of specimens is yearly more manifest. Exceedingly im-
portant material is constantly offered to us at prices very much below
what it would cost to obtain it by collecting, and in many instances,
when refused, it is eagerly taken by the museums and institutions of
Europe. The extent and character of the recent additions to the collec-
tions may, perhaps, be better shown by the appended table than in any
other way. This table shows comparatively the results of a census of
the collections, taken for the past six years, and from it appears that
the number of specimens or of lots of specimens on hand at the close of
52

the year is more than 2,800,000. These figures are in many instances
estimated, and are always subject to revision.

increased before the publication of the Museum report for the year, in
which a complete tabulated statement will be given.

The registrar states that 12,400 boxes and packages were received
during the year and entered upon the transportation records of the
Smithsonian Institution. In this number are included 1,482 ‘accession
lots” for the Museum.

Many valuable contributions have been made, as in past years, through
the friendly co-operation of the Departments and Bureaus of the Gov-
ernment and of officers of the Army and Navy. For this assistance the
sincere thanks of the Museum are tendered. The geographical index
to the “list of accessions,” which will be published in the report of the
assistant secretary in charge of the Museum, will show the sources of
the material received during the year. Among the most important
accessions are the following: A collection of old coins, chiefly Roman,
deposited by Mr. Thomas Wilson; a collection of archzological and
ethnographical specimens bequeathed to the Museum by Dr. Charles
Rau; the Lea collection of shells and minerals presented during Pro-
fessor Baird’s life-time, but not received until this year; ethnological]
objects from Egypt, presented by Dr. James Grant Bey, and from the
Congo region, by Lieut. H. H. Taunt, U.S. Navy; a collection of birds from
Central America and islands in the Caribbean Sea, collected by Mr.
Charles H. Townsend; a pair of living buffaloes presented by Mr. KH. G.
Blackford ; a skin of an unusually large moose, purchased from Mr. A.
B. Douglas; the first cast made in the mold taken from the living face
of Abraham Lincoln, by Leonard Volk, in 1860; also the first casts
made in the molds from Lincoln’s hands, and the first bronze cast of
the face mold, and bronze casts of the hands presented to the Govern-
ment of the United States, for deposit in the Museum, by thirty-three
subscribers, through a committee composed of Thomas B. Clarke, Au-
gustus St. Gaudens, Richard Watson Gilder, and Erwin Davis; Indian
pottery from the pueblos of the Jemez Valley, in New Mexico, collected
by Col. James Stevenson, of the Bureau of Ethnology; a collection of
bird eges from Lieut. H.C. Benson, U.S. Army, and from Dr. J.C. Mer-
rill, U.S. Army ; a collection of reptiles and batrachians from Dr. R. Ells-
worth Call; extensive collections of fishes and marine invertebrates,
collected by the U.S. Fish Commission ; a large collection of Syrphida
from Dr. S. W. Williston, forming the types of Bulletin 31 of the Na-
tional Museum ; a valuable series of paleozoic fossils from the New
York State Museum of Natural History; a series of fossil plants, sev-
eral of them new to science, from the coal-measures of Alabama, pre-
sented by Prof. I. C. Russell, of the U.S. Geological Survey; a large
collection of eruptive, metamorphie, and sedimentary rocks from Colo-
rado, collected by Dr. S. I’. Emmons, of the U.S. Geological Survey ; an
extensive series of rocks, collected by Mr. G. P. Merrill in New Jersey,
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine; a very interesting series of
aluminum bronzes and other rare alloys, made by Bierman, of Hanover,
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and presented by the ‘Iron Age,” of New York City. Some objects of
value have also been added to other sections and departments of the
Museum, especially to those of Transportation and Graphic Arts. These
will be enumerated in the “list of accessious” already referred to.

A collection intended to illustrate the application of photography to
scientific purposes is now being prepared by Mr. T. W. Smillie for exhi-
bition at the Cincinnati Exposition. This collection includes interest-
ing contributions from Prof. H.C. Pickering, of Harvard University ;
U.S. Magnetic Station, U. 8. Coast Survey, Army Medical Museum, U.
S. Light-House Board, U.S. Signal Office, the proving ground at An-
napolis, Commander CO. I. Goodrich, U.S. Navy; Mr. J. W. Osborne, and
Dr. Thomas Taylor, of the Department of Agriculture.

The increasing popularity of the Museum seems to be proved by the
fact that during the year the number of visitors to the Museum Build-
ing was 249,025, or 52,465 more than last year, and the number of visit-
ors to the Smithsonian Building was 103,442, or 4,891 more than last
year.

Following the usual policy, free access to the collections has been
granted to students in the various branches of natural history, and in
many instances specimens have been lent to specialists for comparison
and study. Instruction in taxidermy and photography have been given
to several applicants. This has in some instances been done at the re-
quest of an executive department; otherwise, the students have been
expected to render voluntary service as an equivalent. Permission has
been granted by the Superintendent of Police, upon the indorsement of
the Smithsonian Institution, to several young men to shoot birds in the
District of Columbia for scientific purposes. This privilege is provided
for by law in section 14, chapter 213, vol. I of the ‘‘ Supplement to the Re-
vised Statutes of the United States.” The use of the lecture hall in the
Mnseum has been granted for lectures and meetings of scientific socie-
ties, as follows: A course of Saturday lectures, twelve in number, com-
mencing on February 18; four lectures given under the auspices of the
Amateur Botanical Club of Washington, on December 10, 21, January
7, 21; the annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, April
17-21. The Biological Society of Washington and the Botanical Sec-
tion of this society also held some of their meetings in the Museum.
The usual courtesies have been extended to other public institutions
by the gift and joan of photographs and working drawings of Museum
cases, drawings and photographs of specimens, and copies of Museum
labels. |

Two hundred and sixty-four lots of specimens have been distributed
to museums, colleges, and individuals. Applications for duplicate spec.
imens are each year increasing innumber. During this year fifty-three
have been received. It has always been the policy of the Smithsonian
Institution to distribute in this way the duplicate material which accu-
mulates in the departments of the Museum, and the importance of this
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

policy has been repeatedly commented upon in previous reports. It
has not yet, however, been found practicable to comply with these
applications as fast as received, because the curators have not yet had
time to arrange the duplicate material into sets for distribution. It is
to be hoped that in future it may be possible to relieve the curators of
some of the routine work which they are now obliged to attend to per-
sonally, in order that among other things they may devote more of their
time to the classification of duplicate material.

The importance of museum collections for purposes of education in
schools is becoming of late years much more fully appreciated, and it
seems desirable to make some changes in the manner of distributing
specimens; especially to make the collections sent out so complete—
within such limits as it may be possible to develop them by methods of
arrangement and labels—that they may be ready for immediate use in
instruction. In order to do this it is often necessary to supplement du-
plicate material on hand by other material specially collected. With
this in view the curators of mineralogy and physical geology have been
requested to obtain during the year in large quantities, for the special
purpose of distribution, specimens of minerals from certain rich locali-
ties. By this means material for a considerable number of series of
minerals and rocks have been obtained, while at the same time valua-
ble additions have been made to the Museum collections. Mr. Merrill,
curator of physical geology, visited during the summer, points in North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Ver-
mont, and New York. Mr. Yeates, assistant curator of minerals, vis-
ited the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and North
Carolina. Special attention has been thus given to obtaining geologi-
cal and mineralogical material for distribution, owing to the fact that
there is on file a very large number of applications for specimens of
this kind, which it has been impossible so far to meet. Collections of
this character are, furthermore, much better suited for school museums,
especially those which have not much money to spend in the prepara-
tion and installation of specimens, than are the more fragile and perish-
able zodlo gical collections. It is hoped that during the coming year it
will also be practical to make up a considerable number of sets of bird-
skins, illustrating the classification of birds into families.

The report on the operations of the National Museum for the first
half of 1885, and forming Part 11 of the Report of the Smithsonian In-
Stitution, has been received from the Public Printer. This report in-
cludes Mr. Thomas Donaldson’s paper on ‘‘The George Catlin Indian
Gallery.” The bound volumes of volume 9 of the *“‘ Proceedings of the
U.S. National Museum” were received from the Public Printer in Au-
gust. Two hundred copies of this volume had been distributed, signa-
ture by signature,to the collaborators ef the Museum and other scientists
throughout the world. This volume consists of 720 pages, and is illus-

trated by twenty-five plates and six figures. It includes fifty-five papers
by Messrs. Ridgway, Rathbun, Stejneger, Dall, True, and other officers
of the Museum, and by Messrs. Jordan, Higenmann, Hvermann, Law-
rence, and other collaborators. Six new genera and fifty-one new species
of animals are described for the first time in this volume. Signatures
7-31 of volume 10 of the ‘ Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum,”
were printed and distributed. These include 400 pages, and embrace
thirty-three papers by Messrs. Bean, Bollman, Cope, Higenmann, C. H.
Gilbert, Lilljjeborg, Linton, Lucas, McNeill, Rathbun, Ridgway, R. W.
Shufeldt, J. B. Smith, Stejneger, Townsend, and Vasey. In these sig-
natures are contained descriptions of fifty-one new genera and species
of birds, mammals, reptiles, fishes, and insects. Bulletin 32, “ Cata-
logue of Batrachians and Reptiles of Central America and Mexico,”
by Ii. D. Cope, has been issued. Considerable progress has been made
in the printing of Bulletin 33, ‘Catalogue of Minerals,” by Thomas
Kgleston, and of Bulletin 34, “ Batrachia of North America,” by E. D.
Cope.

The Museum report for 188788 is now being prepared, and will in-
clude literary contributions from Dr. H. C. Yarrow, Prof. Otis T. Ma-
son, Mr. F. A. Lucas, and others.

Jireular 36, ‘‘Concerning the Department of Antiquities,” was printed
and widely distributed by the curator of that department. A large
correspondence has resulted, and valuable facts have been collated there-
from. These will be published in the report of the curator.

Nearly 250 papers have been published by the officers of Museum
and about 50 by collaborators. In the latter case the papers are
based upon material inthe Museum. Of the entire number, 79 relate
to insects, 70 to birds, 12 to reptiles, 11 to fossil invertebrates, 9 to min-
erals, and 8 to plants.

The number of labels printed for the Museum during the year is
2,600. In addition, copy for more than 2,000 labels was sent to the
Government Printing Office, but the labels had not been printed at the
end of the fiscal year. It is hoped that next year it may be possible
to secure quicker returns of labels from the Printing Office, since upon
them depends in great part the instructive value of the objects exhib-
ited. ;

The number of publications added to the Library during the year
is 6,063, of which 1,316 are volumes of more than a hundred pages.
The most important accession was the bequest of Dr. Charles Raw’s
library, consisting of 715 volumes and 1,722 pamphlets and other docu-
ments.

Through the co-operation of the U. 8S. Fish Commission the Smith-
sonian Institution has been enabled to secure from Funk Island, for
the National Museum, a coliection of bones of the Great Auk, and in-
cidentally important collections of mammals, birds, bird eggs, fishes,
plants, ores, rocks, stone implements, and fossils were obtained from

Newfoundland, Magdalen Islands, and adjacent islands. An account of
this expedition will be given in a paper by Mr, T°. A. Lucas in Part Il
of the Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1858.

The collection of the department of Ethnology has: been enriched
by the receipt of a most valuable and interesting contribution of
specimens brought from Easter Island, and also of a series of photo-
graphs taken on the island by Paymaster William J. Thomson, U.S.
Navy.

Mr. W. T. Hornaday, curator of living animals, made a collecting
trip to the Northwest in November and secured a large number of living
animals.

Under the joint auspices of the Fish Commission and Smithsonian
Institution Mr. Charles H. Townsend made a collecting tour on Swan
Island and in Central America. Asa result large collections of mam-
mals and birds were obtained for the Museum.

During the summer Mr. IF. H. Knowiton made a collection of the
plants, rocks, and ores of Vermont.

During the year important changes have taken place in connection
with some of the scientific departments of the Museum. Dr. Charles
Rau, Curator of the Department of Prehistoric Anthropology, died on
June 26,1887.* His successor is Mr. Thomas Wilson, who received his
appointment as Honorary Curator on December 1. In November Dr. H.
G. Beyer, U.S. Navy, Honorary Curator of the Section of Materia Medica,
was ordered to other duties, and Dr. J. M. Flint, U.S. Navy, the first Cura-
tor of this collection, has again taken charge. The Museum has com-
menced the formation of a collection of casts of Assyrian and Babylonian
antiquities, in association with the Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Paul
Haupt, Professor of Semitic Languages in the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, was in February appointed Honorary Curator, Dr. Cyrus Adler, of
the same university, consenting to act as Honorary Assistant Curator.
The Section of Transportation, under the care of Mr. J. &. Watkins, has
now reached that point in its history where it may take rank with the
other sections of the Department of Arts and Industries. The Section
of Graphic Arts, under the curatorship of Mr. S. R. Koehler, has made
excellent progress toward the illustration of the resources of the art of
engraving in all its branches. On May 9 the Department of Living
Animals was organized, with Mr. W. T. Hornaday, Chief Taxidermist, as
curator.

As in years past, we have been called upon to contribute to local ex
hibitions, and numerous applications have been. made for material,
which has always been refused on the ground that nothing could be done
without an order from Congress. Numerous bills of this kind have been
before Congress for consideration. Oneof these, passed during the fiscal
year of 1887, applied to the present year. This was the bill authorizing

the sending of collections to Minneapolis. The joint resolution, which
was approved March 3, 1887, is here quoted:

[Public resolution No. 18.]

JOINT RESOLUTION authorizing the several Executive Departments of the Govern-
ment to loan to the Minneapolis Industrial Exposition certain articles for exhibit.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled, That it is desirable, in any way con-
sistent with existing laws, and without risk to Government property
or expense to the National Treasury, to encourage the effort being
made for the opening and holding of a grand industrial and educational
exposition of the Northwest, at the city of Minneapolis, in the State of
Minnesota, and the interests of the whole northwestern section of our
country demand it be made an unqualified success; and it be, and is
hereby, approved that the heads of the several Executive Departments
shall, in whatever respects they may in their judgment see convenient
and proper, loan any articles or material suitable to such purpose:
Provided, That such loan be made entirely on the responsibility of said
Minneapolis Industrial Exposition, and shall not be of material needed
for use in either Department, and shall not in any way interrupt the
daily routine of duty or order in any branch of the Government, and
shall be returned to the proper Department, in good order, within one
month after the close of the exposition: And provided further, That
before any such loan shall be made, the proper head of the Department
shall require and receive a good and sufficient bond, by or in behalf of
such exposition, for the safe return thereof as aforesaid, and to indem-
nify and save harmless the Government of the United States, or any
Department thereof, from any liability or expense on account thereof,
or on account of this resolution.

Approved, March 3, 1887.

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution was prepared under the
direction of Mr. W. V. Cox, Chief Clerk of the National Museum, who
was appointed representative of the Institution on this occasion. The
exhibit may be classified under the following heads: Ethnology, Tex-
tiles and Fabrics, Metallurgy, Deer Antlers and Horns, Casts of Fishes
of North America, Photographs of Government Buildings, including the
Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, collection of specimens
illustrating the composition of the human body. The total weight of
this exhibit was 21,507 pounds. The entire Government exhibit at-
tracted much attention, and repeated requests were made by the man-
agers of the exposition for the privilege of keeping the articles for
another exhibition. :

A much more extensive enterprise was the Ohio Valley and Central
States Exposition at Cincinnati, opening July 4, 1888, which, together
with an exhibition at Marietta on July 15 to July 19, was made the sub-
ject of a bill which, having passed both Houses, was approved May 28,
1888. <A copy of the act approved May 28, and of the explanatory act
approved July 16, is here given.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

AN ACT making an appropriation to enable the several Executive Departments of
the Government and the Bureau of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution,
including the National Museum and Commiission of Fish and Fisheries, to partici-
pate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, to be held
at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth to October twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred
and eighty-eight.

Whereas the States which comprise the Northwest Territory and the
adjacent States will hold at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July fourth to Octo-
ber twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, a centennial
exposition commemorative of the organization of the Northwest Terri-
tory, under the ordinance of seventeen hundred and eighty-seven, in
which exposition all the States and Territories of the United States and
the General Government have been invited to participate, the object
being in said exposition to present a panorama of the nation’s resources
and present state of progressive development by an exhibition of the
products of agriculture, of the various industries and fine arts; also the
results of advancement made in the sciences ; the whole illustrating the
opportunities secured to and the possibilities which wait upon the citi-
zens of this Republic; and

Whereas the citizens of the Ohio Valley and the several States adja-
cent thereto have made suitable and adequate preparation and arrange-
ments for holding said exposition, and are desirous—and it being fif and
proper—that the several Execntive Departments of the Government,
the Department of Agriculture, the Smithsonian Institution, including
the National Museum and Commission of Fish and Fisheries, should
participate in said exhibition: Therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the head of each of the
several Executive Departments of the Government, the Commissioner of
Agriculture, and the Smithsonian Institution, including the National
Museum and Commission of Fish and Fisheries, under the direction of
the President of the United States, be, and they are hereby, authorized
and directed to prepare and make suitable exhibits at the said Centen-
nial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, to be held at
Cincinnati, beginning on the fourth of July and closing October twenty-
seventh, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight.

That there shall be appointed a committee of Congress composed of
ten members, five to be appointed by the President of the Senate and
five by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Said committee
is authorized and directed to visit said exposition and make such report
to Congress in that behalf as they may deem needful and proper: Pro-
vided, That the President may in the exercise of his discretion allow
such documents, and exhibits as relate to early settlement at Marietta,
Ohio, and the establishment of civil government in the territory north-
west of the Ohio River, to be taken to Marietta, and exhibited during
the time from July fifteenth to nineteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-
eight, inclusive, under such restrictions and custody as he may direct.

That to enable the several Executive Departments of the Government,
the Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution, in-
cluding the National Museum and the Commission of Fish and Fish-
eries, to participate in said exposition, to be held as aforesaid, there is
hereby appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise
appropriated, one hundred and forty-seven thousand seven hundred and
fifty dollars, apportioned as follows :

For the War Department, seven thousand one hundred and fifty dol-
lars.

For the Navy Department, fifteen thousand dollars,

jars.

For the Department of Agriculture, twenty thousand dollars.

For the Post-Office Department, five thousand dollars.

For the Department of Justice, two thousand dollars.

For the Smithsonian Institution, including the Commission of Fish
and Fisheries, fifty thousand dollars.

For expenses of the committee of Congress, two thousand five hun-
dred dollars.

That the President may, if in his judgment it shall be deemed neces-
sary and expedient in order to secure the best results with greatest
economy, transfer a part of the fund hereby apportioned to one Depart-
ment or Bureau to another Department or Bureau. Theterm Bureau
wherever used herein shall be construed to include the Agricultural
Department, the Smithsonian Institution, and Commission of Fish and
Fisheries.

That the President of the United States is hereby authorized to de-
tail an officer of the pay department of the Army or Navy to disburse
the fund appropriated by this act.

The payments on account of expenses incurred in carrying out and
into effect the provisions hereof shall be made on itemized vouchers ap-
proved by the representative of the Department incurring the liability,
and a person to be designated by the President to make final audit of
said accounts: Provided, That payment of the expenses incurred by the
committee of Congress shall be made on vouchers approved by the
chairman of said e¢ommittee.

That the head of each of said Executive Departments and of the De-
partment of Agriculture, Smithsonian Institution, and Commission of
Fish and Fisheries shall, from among the officers or employees thereof,
appoint a suitable person to act as representative of such Department
or Bureau, and said representative shall, under the direction and con-
trol of the head of the Department or Bureau, supervise the preparation
and conduct of the exhibits herein provided for.

That no officer or employee appointed as aforesaid shall be paid extra
or additional compensation by reason of services rendered in virtue of
such employment; but nothing herein shall be so construed as to pre-
vent the payment of the just and reasonable expenses of any commit-
tee, officer, or employee appointed or employed under and by virtue of
the provisions of this act.

ion of Canada for the purpose of being exhibited at said exposition
shall be admitted free of duty, subject, however, to such conditions and
regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may impose and prescribe.

Approved, May 28, 1888.

JOINT RESOLUTION declaring the true intent and meaning of the act approved
May twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled, That it is the true intent and meaning
of the act of Congress approved May twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred
and eighty-eight, by the President of the United States, entitled “An
act making appropriation to enable the several Executive Departments
of the Government, and the Bureauof Agriculture, and the Smithsonian

Institution, including the National Museum and the Commission of Fish
and Fisheries, to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio
Valley and Central States, to be held at Cincinnati, Ohio, from July
fourth to October seventh, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight,” that
the President of the United States may, in his discretion make an order
directing that any documents, papers, maps not original, books or other
exhibits which properly and pertinently relate to the establishment of
civil government in the territory northwest of the Ohio River, may be
sent upon an executive order from any of the several Departments in
said act named, or from the exhibits now at Cincinnati, and that the
appropriation of money in said act to defray the expenses of such ex-
hibits, may be made applicable, inso far as the President of the United
States may direct, to the payment of the expenses of the care, trans-
portation to and return of such exhibits from Marietta. And the same
shall be paid from such fund heretofore set apart for each Department
as the President may order. Nor shall anything in said act be so con-
strued as to prevent the purchase of suitable materials, and the em-

ployment of proper persons, to complete or modify series of objects, and
classes of specimens, when in the judgment of the head of any Depart-

ment such purchase or employment, or both is necessary in the proper
preparation and conduct of an exhibit. Nor to authorize the removal
from their places of deposit in Washington of any original paper or
document or laws or ordinances whatever.

Approved, July 16, 1888.

The Assistant Secretary, Dr. Goode, was appointed representative of
the Smithsonian Institution in the preparation of this display, in ac-
cordance with the provisions of the act. Preparations for these exhi-
bitions were nearly completed at the close of the fiscal year, and some
fourteen car-loads of material have been sent by this Institution to
Cincinnati. The sum of $50,000 was appropriated for the use of the
Smithsonian Institution (including the National Museum and Fish
Commission), and $10,000 of this sum was transferred to the Commis-
sioner of Fisheries.

In this connection it may be well to say that, although sympathizing
with the effort to extend the educational work of the Institution and of
the National Museum throughout the country, the growing tendency to
withdraw for a considerable portion of each year some of the most in-
teresting and valuable parts of the collections, is liable to many objec-
tions,—objections which are much stronger now, since the Museum is
approaching a final arrangement in classification than some years ago,
when the collections were unsettled and unformed. Not only is the
work of the entire Museum seriously impaired, but the collections sent
out are invariably damaged, sume irreparably, some to such a degree
that it requires much time and expense to restore them. Furthermore,
the standard of local exhibitions is yearly becoming higher, and the
local managers are no longer satisfied to accept from us the specimens
which, in the judgment of the Museum officials, can be spared, but are
disposed to insist upon having the most valuable and costly objects,
which if destroyed would be irreplaceable, and if sent at all are espe-
cially liable to damage. In addition to this should be taken into account
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the fact that temporary exposition buildings are never fire-proof, and
that the time is sure to come, if the present practice prevails, when some
exhibition building containing Government collections, to the value of
hundreds of thousands of dollars, will be destroyed. The experience
of the Mexican Government in its participation at the New Crleans
Exposition and of the Government of New South Wales in 1883 may
be taken as warnings. If, however, in future years Congress is dis-
posed to order such participation in exhibitions, I would urge as a ne-
cessity that legislation should be provided at least six months in ad-
vance of the date of the exhibition; otherwise, the participation can
not but be unsatisfactory and expensive. I am also disposed to lay
stress upon the necessity of liberal appropriations, which should be
made with the understanding that new material may be obtained, which
shall not only replace that which has been lost in past exhibitions, but
shall enrich the Museum collections for home use and for use in future
exhibition work. If this necessity is not recognized, the result will be
that in a few years the Museum will be greatly impoverished, not only
by the destruction of material, but also by the dissipation of the energy
of its staff, which being applied to temporary purposes in this way is
taken away from its legitimate work. It would indeed seem onty fair
that a distraction of this kind, which affects in large degree every
officer and employé, should be compensated for by the opportunity to
purchase new material which will remain permanently the property of
the Government and increase the usefulness of the Governmental
Museum work.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and in com-
pliance with acts of Congress, was continued during the year 1887~88
in charge of Maj. J. W. Powell, as oes who has furnished the fol-
lowing account of operations.

The work of the yearis most Dene ee reported upon under two
general heads of field work and office work.

FIELD WORK.

The field work of the year is divided into (1) mound explorations and
(2) general field studies, which during the year were chiefly directed to
archeology, linguistics, and pictography.

Mound explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds of the east-
ern United States was, in former years, under the superintendence of
Prof. Cyrus Thomas.

Much of his attention and that of his assistants was directed to the
preparation for the publication of his reports on the work of the mound
division during the previous years of its labors.

As the work of writing up the report from the field-notes, examining
the collections, and preparing the plats and illustrations proceeded, it
was found that here and there were omissions in the original examina-
tions which left the details of certain sections incomplete. It therefore
became necessary to close these gaps as far as possible. The most im-
portant hiatus was filled by an examination of the lake border of the
United States from Detroit westward to the head of Lake Superior, to
ascertain whether the historic Indian localities along that line were
marked by mounds or other ancient works.

Another undertaking which had been begun during the last month
of the preceding year was a survey of certain inclosures and other an-
cient remains of Ohio, to test the reliability and accuracy of the surveys
made by Squier and Davis and others. This was continued during a
portion of the past year.

A third item consisted in completing, as far as possible, the list of
mound localities to be used in preparing the maps.

During the year the assistants were Messrs. James D. Middleton,
Gerard Fowke, and Henry L. Reynolds.

On July 15 Messrs, Middleton and Fowke went to Ohio, where they were
engaged about one month in surveying the ancient works of that region.
During the same time Mr. Reynolds was employed in the same State
collecting data for the archeologic maps. From Ohio Mr. Fowke went
to Michigan, making the tour of the lake border of the United States
from Detroit westward to Duluth at the head of Lake Superior. He
made careful examinations for ancient works and aboriginal remains,
especially at the following-named points: Detroit; Port Huron; Sagi-
naw ; Ogeman County; about Traverse Bay; Beaver Island; Mackinae
Island and the main land on both sides; Sault Ste. Marie; Marquette;
Munissing; the copper region; Ontonagon; Ashland; Bayfield; La
Pointe (the Old Chaquamagon),and Duluth. Returning by way of
Prairie du Chien, Wis., and Davenport, Lowa, he stopped at Carbon-
dale, Ill., the point selected as headquarters for the season. After
writing out a preliminary report of his trip he went to Kentucky to
examine certain works in the northern part of that State, and thence
to Washington. During May and June, 1888, he was engaged in ex-
ploring mounds in Pike County, Ohio.

From Ohio Mr. Middleton went to Wisconsin to survey certain groups
of works in the southern and southwestern part of that State, which
occupied him until autumn. He then went to Carbondale where he was
engaged most of the winter in working up the plats and other results
of his surveys. Before the close of the winter he made a survey of
certain groups in southeastern Missouri and of the Seltzertown group
in Mississippi. During April, May, and June he was engaged in sur-
veying and examining groups in southern Ohio and northern Kentueky.

Mr. Reynolds, after leaving Ohio, was engaged during the remainder
of the summer, and until he went to Carbondale in autumn, collecting
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

material for maps, in Michigan and Wisconsin. He remained at Car-
bondale until the last of December.

General field studies—While engaged in making a geological recon-
naissance of the Tewan Mountains, the Director was enabled to study
on the ground a large field of archeology. This is an extensive district
of country drained by the Chama and Jemez, and other tributaries of
the Rio Grande del Norte. In prehistoric and early historic times the
region was mainly occupied by tribes of the Tewan stock. The people
lived in villages or pueblos, many of which were built of the rude stone
that abounds in convenient forms for such structures. The cliffs of the
canons carved by the many streams that drain the mountain area are
often composed of voleanic tufa so soft that it can be easily worked with
rude stone tools, and many of the people had learned to hew it into
convenient shapes for architectural purposes.

Some of the tribes at different periods in their history left their stone
pueblos and constructed homes for themselves by excavating chambers
in the tufa cliffs. These cavate dwellings, now abandoned and in ruins,
and the ruins of many other ancient dwellings, are scattered through-
out this entire country.

On the northern flank of the Tewan Mountains, near the river Chama
and about 3 miles below Abiquiu, an extensive ruin was visited, the
walls of which were constructed of clay built up ina mass. By what
mechanical devices they were built was not discovered, but it is evident
that the clay was not made into adobes. During the study of all these
ruins interesting archeologic collections were made, especially of articles
in stone and clay.

Mr. James Stevenson, who had accompanied the Director in the above-
mentioned explorations, proceeded, at the beginning of October, 1887,
to the pueblo of Silla, about 8 miles south of Jemez, and spent six weeks
engaged, with remarkable success, in making a collection and studying
the customs, sociology, and mythology of the people.

The Sillaretain their ancient religion in great purity in spite of the
efforts of Christian priests which have been continued for centuries.
Their ceremonial chambers contained brightly-colored altars of wood,
before which many idols and other sacred objects were placed, while the
walls were hung with various mythologic emblems of great delicacy and
beauty. Mr. Stevenson was invited to inspect all these freely. The
fact was disclosed that the people had a finer variety of idols than even
the Zuni. Their stone idols in human form presented a special feature,
the carving being of a higher type than any before seen in the region.

From one of the large ceremonial chambers he was passed through a
concealed opening into a much smaller room literally filled with masks
made in imitation of their idols, all of which he was permitted to examine
at leisure, a most unusual privilege, as these people have a superstitious
dread of their masks being seen when off the person. This collection of
masks is not only large but interesting in variety. Sketches were made
of many of them.
: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

The Silla, like the other pueblos, have shrines scattered around the
village near and far, which Mr. Stevenson was invited to visit and in-
spect, finding some of them guarded by colossal stone animals crudely
formed. Having unexpectedly discovered, while studying their mythol-
ogy, that these people, like the Moki, held ceremonials with living snakes,
including the rattlesnake, he asked to be shown the exact place where the
snake ceremonies were held. This proved to be 5 or 6 miles distant from
the pueblo, in a desolate spot among arid hills, where there was a small
square log structure in which the snake order held ceremonies previous
to the dance, the snakes being contained in two large pottery vases.
- The cave when found was closed and completely concealed by a stone
slab, upon the removal of which two splendid specimens of ancient vases
were disclosed, decorated with pictures of the rattlesnake, mountain lion,
and bear, and one of these vases now occupies a position in the National
Museum as a part of the collection of the past season.

This collection, consisting of 864 specimens, is in many respects the
most valuable ever secured by Mr. Stevenson, as it not only includes a
great variety of form and decoration in pottery (some of the pieces being
- very old), but it embraces the largest and most interesting collection of
idols and fetiches yet made. Many of the stone images are in human
form and different from anything possessed by the Zuni or Moki In-
dians; those of the latter being, with few exceptions, carved in wood,
while the Silla possessed a large number of well-carved stone idols in
human form. The stone animal idols are also superior to and larger
than any heretofore collected. One of the features of the collection is
the beautiful variety of plumed and other fetiches.

Mr. Stevenson made copious notes on the mythology and sociology
of the Silla, and obtained the most complete cosmogony ever secured
by him from any people.

He closed his field season with the Zuni priest-doctors, obtaining
from them additional detailed accounts of their secret medicine order.

During the months of August and September Mr. W. H. Holmes was
engaged in studying the antiquities of Jemez Valley, New Mexico.
This valley is tributary to the Rio Grande on the west, and its middle
portion is about 50 miles west of Santa Fé.

Fifteen important ruined pueblos and village sites were examined.
They correspond closely in type to those of the north, and bear evi-
dence in most cases of pre-Spanish occupation. Besides the larger
ruins there are a multitude of minor ruins, small houses and lodges of
stone, scattered through the forests. Mr. Holmes carried his investi-
gations of the ruins of Colorado and New Mexico as far south as Abi-
quiu, which village lies at the northern end of the group of mountains
in which the Rio Jemez takes its rise. His work of the year has
therefore enabled_him to connect his studies of the northern localities
with those of the south in which the numerous modern pueblos are lo-
cated. The chain of observations thus secured is of value in a study

of the art products of the vast region formerly occupied by town-build-
ing tribes.

-articular attention was given to an examination of the ceramic re-
mains. These constitute one of the means of developing the history of
the pre-Columbian inhabitants. A large series of specimens was for-
warded to the Museum.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff, with Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff as his assistant, left
Washington for the field, September 1, 1887, and returned March 18,
1888. <A group of cave lodges, excavated in the top and sides of a cin-
der cone at the base of San Francisco Mountain, and situated about 18
miles northeast of Flagstaff, Ariz., was visited and sketches and dia-
grams were made. ‘The cliff dwellings of Walnut Canon, about 12 miles
southeast of Flagstaff, were also examined.

Later the work of the field party was among the ruined pueblos near
Keams Caiion, which connect traditionally with the present Moki vil-
lages. These ruins, six in number, are distributed on the north border
of the Jeditoh Valley, and are scattered along for a distance of 12 miles.

The party afterwards camped for some time in the vicinity of Oraibe,
the largest of the present villages of Tusayan. Herea study was made
of the primitive constructional devices still in use. Two interesting
ruins were discovered in this neighborhood and their ground plans se-
cured. In the northern ruin a cave or underground apartment was
found containing vestiges of stone walls and supporting timbers. The
small village of Moen-Kopi was surveyed. This is an outlying farming
pueblo, occupied mainly during the planting and harvesting seasous.
A very extensive system of irrigation is in operation in this vicinity.

Subsequently the party spent six weeks at the Chaco ruins in New
Mexico. An accurate architectural survey of the more important ruins
was made, and the plans secured reveal many points of interest. The
degree of mechanical knowledge displayed by the builders of these
pueblos has been greatly exaggerated by earlier explorers, as also the
quality of the masonry. Close examination reveals on the part of the
builders ignorance of some of the simplest principles of construction.
Several ruins, not previously known, were surveyed and others were
visited. Late in the season the party platted the pueblo of Jemez,
situated upon a river of the same name, a tributary of the Rio Grande.

At various times during the progress of the field-work studies were
made of the more primitive Navajo architecture, and many sketches
and diagrams were prepared illustrating the Navajo system of framing
these “ hogans,” or conical wood and earth houses. Several photographs
of typical examples were taken.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff left Washington for the field September 1 and
returned February 23. In addition to general assistance to the party
under charge of Mr. Victor Mindeleff, he was in immediate charge of
the surveying. Ground plans of thirteen important ruins, in addition
to sketch plaus of a number of others of less importance, and of two
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

inhabited pueblos, were added to those already in the possession of the
Bureau. The methods of surveying followed in previous years were
continued in this. The plans, as a rule, are drawn to a seale of 20 feet
to | inch, and the drawing is finished in the field. The topography is
in all cases indicated by contour lines of 5-foot intervals, sketched upon
a basis of a number of points determined with a level. The ground plan
was usually drawn over a number of points and lines, which were located
with an instrument, and the direction of all the walls was determined
by a compass, in order to detect any irregularities. It was found that
the regularity and symmetry of plan which characterizes many pub-
lished ground plans ‘of ruins in the southwest—notably those of the
Chaco ruins—are not justified by the facts exhibited by the ruins them-
selves, though upon cursory examination, and even upon preliminary
survey, the ground plans of many of these ruins are apparently sym-
metric. The plans obtained will be publisked in articles now being
- prepared.

Mr. A. M. Stephen was engaged during half of the fiscal year in col-
lecting traditions avd other matter from the Tusayan villages and
among the Navajos. He has transmitted a number of valuable short
papers en these topics and also on the house-lore of the Moki Indians,
and has furnished descriptions and drawings of the ‘“ Kisis” or rude
temporary shelters of the Moki, comparing these with the primitive
structures of the Navajos.

The publications of Henry R. Schooleraft, issued in 1853, upon the
pictographs of the Ojibwa, give the impression that they were nearly
as far advanced in hieroglyphic writing as were the Egyptians imme-
diately before their pictorial representations had become syllabic.
Doubts had been entertained of the accuracy of this account which it
was considered to be the duty of the Bureau of Ethnology to resolve ;
therefore at the beginning of the fiscal year Col. Garrick Mallery and
Dr. W. J. Hoffman were directed to proceed to Indian reservations in
Minnesota and Wisconsin and learn whatever remained accessible on
the subject.

Dr. Hoffman proceeded to the White Earth and Red Lake Reserva-
tions, Minnesota, and remained for three months, making the required re-
searches among the Ojibwa. He found that the most important bireh-
bark records are those relating to the Ojibwa cosmogony, the institu-
tion of the Midewin or Grand Medicine Society (in which is preserved
all that pertains to the supposed sacred mission of the Shaman), and
the songs used in connection with the ritual and the initiation of candi-
dates into that society. i

The pictographie charts are, as a rule, in the possession of the Mide
or Grand Medicine Man, though records relating to hunting and per-
sonal exploits, as well as directions for killing game, gathering fruits,
and making journeys, and even personal letters, are made by other
members of the tribe who possess more than ordinary intelligence,
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The great mass of charts consist of mnemonic songs, pertaining to
incantations, exorcism, and other ceremonies, and a considerable number
of these records were obtained, together with their interpretations.
Sketches of tattooed Indians were also made, but it was learned that
this custom is almost extinct, the only modern markings being those
applied to various portions of the face for the exorcism of evil spirits
‘sausing neuralgia, headache, and other pains. Hasty sketches were
obtained also of an old Grand Medicine chart at Red Lake, a protracted
examination of it not being permitted by the keeper of the record.

In addition to the pictographic material, a quantity of mythologie
matter was collected, all or nearly all of which: was intimately con-
nected with the rites of the secret society of the Midewin, or Grand
Medicine.

Colonel Mallery directed his attention chiefly to the examination of
the Ojibwa on the La Pointe and Red Cliff Reservations in Wisconsin,
and although it is aless favorable field for ethnologic ressarch than
those mentioned in Minnesota, owing to the larger and closer intluence
of civilization, he obtained evidence complementing the observations
and conclusions of Dr. Hoffman. Asa general result it is found that
there still exists among the Ojibwa a remarkable degree of pictographic
skill and it is employed in ordinary affairs of life as well as in the serv-
ice of religion and ceremonial rites. The statements of Schoolcraft,
however, are shown to be exaggerated, or at least erroneous, especially
in their attribution of mystic symbolism to devices purely ideographic
or mnemonic, The apparently significant coloration of his figures is
deceptive, as colors are not now and probably never have been used in
the genuine records.

In August, Colonel Mallery proceeded alone to Cape Breton and _
Prince Edward Islands, Nova Scotia, and Maine, to investigate the
bark records and petroglyphs of Micmacs and the Abnaki. Special
study was made as to the probability of an aboriginal source for many
of the characters supposed to have been first used by French mission-
aries in 1652, and afterward printed at Vienna, Austria, in 1862, with
additions and changes, under the direction of Rev. Charles Kauder,
and now generally styled the “ Micmac Hieroglyphs.”

A most interesting and uuique body of rock etchings was discovered
at and near Kejimkoojic Lake, Nova Scotia, and accurate copies of
many of them were secured. On account of their number, their in-
trinsic interest and the evidences of their antiquity, these etchings
form a highly important addition to the collections before made, es-
pecially as they are in a region from which no representation of that
nature had been reported. A petroglyph of interest near Machias,
Me., not before known, was also copied. A valuable collection was for
the first time obtained of birch-bark pictographs still made or formerly
used by the Passamaquoddy and Penobseot tribes of the Abnaki in
Maine, showing a similarity in the use of picture-writing between the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

members of the extensive Algonkian stock in the regions west of the
Great Lakes and those on the northeastern sea-board. The correlation
of the pictographic practice in manner and extent was before inferen-
tially asserted, but no satisfactory evidence of it had been presented
until the researches of the present year brought into direct comparison
the pictography of the Ojibwa with that of the Miemaes and Abnaki.
Colonel Mallery returned to Washington in October.

Mr. James Mooney spent the earlier months of the fiscal year in the
examination of the northern division of Cherokees with reference to the
dialectic difference of vocabulary between them and the main body of
the same tribe in the Indian Territory from which they have long been
separated, and also, in studying for the same comparison their reli-
gious practices, traditions, social customs, and arts. The northern
Cherokees are found to have been less affected by civilization than
those of the south, and they can therefore be studied with manifest
advantage. Mr. Mooney procured a large amount of valuable material
from them.

OFFICE WORK.

Director Powell was frequently occupied during the year in the ex-
amination of undetermined problems pertaining to his work upon the
classification of the Indian linguistic stocks, the scope of which has been
explained in his former reports. It was found necessary to defer decis-
ion respecting some of the stocks until after obtaining the result of
additional field-work planned for the ensuing year.

Colonel Mallery, after his return from the field-work, was engaged in
study of important and novel points developed thereby, and in contin-
ued research and correspondence on sign language and pictography.

Dr. Hoffman, while assisting in the same work, prepared an atlas and
topograhie chart showing all the petrogylphs within the limits of the
United States and adjacent countries so far recorded in the archives of
the Bureau, and all particulars of manipulation, coloration, position,
and other characteristics of interest, with descriptions and references
to authorities.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw was chiefly employed in a solution of problems
relating to the geographic distribution of the linguistic families of North
American Indians in the territory north of Mexico. When not engaged
in this work or with executive duties he continued the preparation of a
dictionary in the nature of a synonomy of tribal names of the North
American Indians, now well advanced toward completion, the general
character and object of which have been set forth in a former report.

While in general charge of that division of the oftice work he specially
attended to the Sahaptinian, Salishan, Chemakuman, Chinookan, and
several other linguistic stocks of the Pacific slope.

During the first five months of the year Mr. A. 8S. Gatschet was en-
gaged in digesting the results of his recent trip to Louisiana, Texas, and
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mexico, and utilizing them in the compilation of the Indian tribal
synonomy now in course of preparation by the Bureau.

His designated share in that work comprised the families of the south-
ern Indians from the Rio Grande to the Atlantic sea-board of Florida,
namely, the stocks of the Natchez, Atakapa, Shetimasha, Tonkawe,
Pakawa (otherwise known under the vague designation of ‘ Coahuilteco
o Tejano”), Tonica, Yuchi, and Tim mucua, and the most important stock
of them all, the Maskoki family. His work of correlating the informa-
tion of these tribes for the synonomy can now be considered as com-
pleted, though some important tribes can not be classified linguistically,
e. g., the Koroas and Pascagoulas, on account of the absence of all
information in the documents of early chroniclers relating to these
extinet tribes. The Adai, classed by Gallatin as a distinct family, is
believed by Mr. Gatschet to be affiliated with the Caddoan stock as a
dialect distantly related to YAtassi and Caddo proper.

After concluding his labors on the tribal synonomy, Mr. Gatschet re-
sumed his work on the grammar of the Klamath language of south-
western Oregon. He combined all the results of his recent studies of
both dialects, the northern and the southern, with the facts previously
aequired by him and composed a treatise on the morphology of the lan-
guage. This has now been rewritten three times by him in order to
secure completeness and accuracys The *‘phonetics” are already cast
in plates as are the chapters on radicals and on prefixion.

From July to December, 1887, Rev. J. Owen Dorsey was engaged in
translating the Teton texts of Mr. George Bushotter, a Dakotan, who
was working under his direction. Mr. Bushotter’s collection consists
of myths, legends, historical papers, an autobiography, accounts of
games, folk-lore and epistles, amounting to two hundred and fifty-eight
textual manuscripts. This work was continued until the following
December when Bushotter resigned, leaving one hundred and twenty-
nine texts to be translated. Mr. Dorsey then continued the work alone
until April 18, 1888, when another Dakotan, Mr. John Bruyier, of Chey-
enne River Agency, began to revise and interpret the Teton texts,
making many corrections in the originals, and supplying important
parts omitted by Bushotter.

Mr. Bruyier also furnished Mr. Dorsey with many examples of the
Teton, as spoken at the Cheyenne River Reservation, which showed that
it differed considerably from that spoken at the Lower Brulé and Pine
Ridge Reservations. He also wrote new versions of several myths,
continuing his work until June 30, 1888.

During the autumn of 1887, Mr. Dorsey completed his work on the
Siouan, Caddoan, Athapasean, Takilman, Kusan, and Yakonan cards
for the Indian synonomy referred to in a former report of the Director.
ie also prepared nearly four hundred type-written foolseap pages of
(ehiga epistles, legends, and other texts, which constitute an important
addition to those published in the Contributions to North American
Vee atte

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 71

Ethnology, vol. v1, part 1. He also transliterated on slips in alpha-
betic order his Winnebago material, obtained in 1878—79, collating it
with the additional material obtained in 1886. This contains fully four
thousand entries.

He gave much attention to the Catawba language, collating parts of
a recent vocabulary (that procured by Mr. Gatschet) with all others
which were accessible.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin contributed to the Indiansynonomy with reference
to several tribes in Oregon and California, and devoted much study to
the large number of myths obtained by him from the same tribes, also
to those of the Iroquois.

Mr. James C. Pilling has continued throughout the year to give a por-
tion of his time to the preparation of bibliographies of the more impor-
tant stocksof North American languages. As stated in the last report,
the manuscript for the Siouan bibliography, the second of the series, was
sent to the printer late in the fiscal year 1886~87. The proof was read
during the summer months and the work received from the Public
Printer November 12. Work was then begun on the Iroquoian stock of
languages, and the close of the fiscal year found it ready for the printer.
Some preliminary work was also done on the Muskokian bibliography.
Late in December Mr. Pilling made a visit to the library of the His-
torical Society of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia, for the purpose of
inspecting and taking descriptions of several important manuscripts in
Indian languages, written by Moravian missionaries, manuscripts then
temporarily in that city and permanently preserved in the Moravian
archives at Bethlehem, Pa., and Fairfield, Canada.

Mr. James Mooney, when notin the field, continued to be charged with
the synonomy relating to the Iroquoian and Algonkin linguistie stocks,
and also worked upon the vocabularies, myths, and notes of informa-
tion procured by him from the northern Cherokees.

During the entire year, except at short intervals when he visited the
field to make personal observations, Professor Thomas has been busily
engaged upon his report. The manuscript for the first volume with
the illustrations was presented for publication about a month before
the close of the fiscal year. The manuscript, illustrations, and maps for
the second volume are well under way and will soon be ready for publi-
cation. Mr. Henry L. Reynolds, from December until the close of the
fiscal year, was at Washington occupied in the preparation of maps,
plates, and diagrams for the report.

During the winter and until the Ist of May, 1888, Mr. Gerard Fowke
was engaged in preparing a paper for areport on the articles of stone
in the Bureau collections.

Mr. W. H. Holmes has charge of the illustrations intended for the
Bureau publications as in previous years, and has as far as possible con-
tinued his studies in aboriginal art and archeology.

The collections acquired during the summer, although not lacking
I2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

interest and value, are not so extensive as those of previous years.
Acquisitions are wade in three distinct ways: first, through members
of the Bureau and the Geological Survey who act as collectors ; second,
by means of exchange for publications or duplicate specimens from
previous collections; and third, by donation. Professor Thomas and
his assistants, working in the Mississippi Valley and on the Atlantic.
slope, report but few accessions during the year. Mr. James Steven-
son secured important collections from the Pueblo country, especially
from the villages of Jemez and Silla, in the Jemez Valley, New Mexico.
These collections include about five hundred specimens of pottery and
nearly four hundred of stone, wood, and other substances. A large per-
centage of these specimens are ancient. A considerable number of
ancient relics of pottery and stone were obtained from ancient ruin sites
in the Jemez and Rio Grande Valleys, New Mexico, by the Director and
Mr. Holmes. Mr. A. P. Davis collected a numberof fragments of ancient
pottery from the ruin of Pueblo Alto, New Mexico. A very interesting
series of objects, illustrating the present condition of the arts among
the Cherokee and Catawba Indians, was procured by Mr. James Mooney
of the Bureau. Mr. DeLancey W. Gill, of the Geological Survey, has
added to the collection many specimens of rude stone implements
from the vicinity of Washington. Donations have been received from
the following persons: Mr. C. C. Jones, fragments of ancient pottery
from Stallings Island, near Augusta, Ga.; Dr. Taylor, fragments of
ancient pottery from Baldwin County, Ala.; General G. P. Thruston,
fraginent of an enormous earthen vase from a suburb of Nashville,
Tenn.; Mr. W. W. Adams, articles of stone from Union Springs, N. Y.;
Mr. C. L. R. Wheeler, cast of a unique stone knife from Westchester
County, N. Y.; and Mr. James Tilton, fragments of pottery from Plum
Island, Massachusetts.

By exchange for books and duplicates from the National Museum the
following acquisitions have been made: .

From Mr. H. P. Hamilton, fragments of ancient pottery from Two
Rivers, Wis., and from Mr. H. W. Hakes, fragments of pottery from
Broome County, N. Y.

By purchase or part purchase the Bureau has obtained from Mr. J.
A. MeNiel one hundred and seventy pieces of ancient pottery from
Chiriqui, Panama, besides some very interesting objects of stone. From
Mr. Ward Bachelor it has acquired a fine collection of earthen and
stone objects from Mexico. From Dr. E. Boban a few fine samples of
Mexican pottery were obtained. All these have been catalogued and
turned over to the National Museum.

Mr. L. B. Case, of Richmond, Ind., has presented to the Bureau the
records of the State Archwologic Association of Indiana, which fell
into his hands as secretary at the discontinuance of the society several
years ago.

Valuable photographs of archologic subjects have been received

from Prof. Anastasio Alfaro, secretary of the National Museum of Costa
Rica; also from Mr. C. F. Low, of Cincinnati; from Mr. A. F. Sears,
of Portland, Oregon; and Mr. D.S. Sears, of Cuba, I].

During the first two months of the fiscal year Mr. Victor Mindeleff
was engaged upon a report on the architecture of the Cibola and Tus-
ayan groups of pueblos, in New Mexico and Arizona. Subsequent to
his return from the field on March 18 that repoit was resumed, but it
was not completed at the end of the fiscal year. The additional data
secured from the Tusayan district during the field season is being pre-
pared for incorporation into the same report.

During the early part of the year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was oceupied
upon that portion of the report on pueblo architecture which had been
assigned to him. On his return from the field on February 23 he re-
sumed work upon that report, but it was suspended in order to take up
the preparation of an exhibit to be made by the Bureau at the Cinein-
nati Centennial Exposition. An exhibit to cover nearly 2,000 square
feet of floor space was prepared, but as the space was limited only the
field work of the Bureau in one especial region, viz, the Pueblo coun-
try, was illustrated, though a small amount of other material was added
for purposes of comparison. This work was not completed at the close
of the fiscal year.

The work of the modeling room was continued throughout the year
in his charge. No new work was taken up, all available labor being
used in preparing a series of duplicates of models previously deposited
in the National Museum. This work was continued from last year. The
series is not yet completed, but the accumulations on hand at the end
of the fiscal year were sufficient to enable the Bureau to make a credit-
able display at the Cincinnati Centennial Exposition without withdraw-
ing, to any large extent, the models deposited in the National Museum.
During the year eight models were added to the duplicate series, and
thrée other models commenced.

Dr. Washington Matthews, surgeon U.S. Army, continued work upon
a grammar and dictionary of the Navajo language.

Mr. EK. W. Nelson was still engaged in the completion of his paper
mentioned in the last 1eport upon the Eskimo of northern Alaska, com-
prising a dictionary with notes upon the grammar of the language and
also upon the myths and customs of the people.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt has continued the study of the Iroquoian lan-
guages and the preparation of a Tuscarora-English dictionary. He
also worked upon the comparison of words, radicals, and terms in the
Iriquoian languages with those in the Cherokee, and in determining the
prehistoric habitat of the Iroquois.

The work of Mr. Charles C. Royce, before reported upon, presenting
the former title of Indian tribes to lands within the present boundaries
of the United States, and the methods of securing their relinguishment,
was substantially prepared for publication, the charts having all been
finished.
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

for several years past it has been part of the work of the Bureau to
take advantage of the frequent presence in Washington of parties styled
“delegations,” of the several Indian tribes visiting the capital, for the
purpose of photographing all the individuals composing them. These
are generally the prominent men of the tribes represented by them and
their photographs have biographie and historic interest as well as an-
thropologic importance. Mr. J. K. Hillers has been in charge of this
branch of the work, and during the past year has secured ninety-nine
photographs of prominent Indians in both full face and profile, in order
to exhibit to better advantage all their facial characteristics. The sub-
jects were from the following tribes, viz:

White Mountain Apache, 15 persons ; Chiracahua Apaches, 20; Jica-
rilla Apaches, 8; Sac and Fox, 7; Utes, 4; Shawnee, 9; Omaha, 20;
Dakota, 11; Oto and Missouri, 5.

In connection with the name of each Indian photographed it has been
the practice to note his age, status in the tribe, and such biographie in-
formation as could be obtained.

NECROLOGY.
MORRISON R. WAITE, CHANCELLOR.

In the order of official precedence, I am called on to first mention the
loss sustained by the Institution during the year, of its Chancellor, the
late eminent Chief-Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Morri-
son R. Waite, who died in this city on the 23d of March last (1888).

His biography belongs to the whole country; but though I have only
to speak of his relations to this Institution, yet one who knew him even
in this limited part of his important duties can not but feel that his was
a character of a singular sincerity, in the proper meaning of the word ;
so that it has been well said of him that he possessed not only a moral
but an intellectual integrity. Of the affection, as well as respect, he
inspired, I have already spoken. Remarkable for this admirable sim-
plicity of character as for his kindness of heart, in his unwavering con-
scientiousness of purpose in the discharge of every duty, he made him-
self, perhaps, the most influential and efficient Chancellor among the
very able ones the Institution has been so fortunate as to possess.
Taking pains to acquaint himself accurately with the character and
requirements of the Institution, evincing an earnest sympathy in its
objects and in its:adopted policy, he was a faithful attendant on the
meetings of the Board during the fourteen years of his presidency.

It seems proper to here record, as a part of the official history of this
bereavement, that a special meeting of the Board of Regents was called
on the 27th of March, 1888, to take appropriate action on the occasion,
and that the following resolutions, expressive of the generai sentiment,
were unanimously adopted and placed upon the journal of the
Board:

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has
been called to meet in extraordinary session by the afflicting intelligence
that Morrison Remick Waite, late Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States and late Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution,
has been removed by the hand of death from the scenes of his high ac-
tivities and distinguished usefulness: Therefore be it

Resolved, That sitting as we do at this time and place, in the very
center of that dark shadow which has fallen upon the whole land in the
lamented death of the late Chief-Justice Waite, and appalled as we are
by the suddenness as well as by the magnitude of the great affliction
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which in coming to the nation at large has come to us individually with
an added pi ithos of sorrow, because of the nearer view we have had for
so many years of the talents, virtues, and graces which found their fa-
miliar home in the person of our honored friend, we could with much
good reason crave for ourselves, in this hour of bereavement, the humble
permission of mourning apart, that we might silently gauge thedepth and
the dimensions of a calamity which brings to us its message of personal
grief and which has also torn away from our highest seat of justice its
venerated and beloved chief; from the legal profession of the country
its foremost official representative and therefore its crowning exponent;
from the walks of social life in this National Capital a commanding
presence, no less remarkable for his genial and open-hearted sincerity
than for his affable and gracious benignity; and from the Christian
communion a true and faithful disciple who witnessed a good confession
as much by the simplicity and humility with which he walked before
God as by the unswerving consistency with which he wore the ornament
of a pure heart and of a meek and quiet spirit before the scrutiny of his
fellow men.

Resolved, That while an obvious sense of propriety must dictate that
we should leave to others in that great forum which was the chosen
arena of his life’s career, the sad privilege of depicting, with minute and
detailed analysis, the remarkable combination of strong and lovely
traits which met in the person of the late Chief-Justice and gave to the
symmetrical character of our beloved friend its blended sweetness and
light, we can not omit, even in this hour of our special sorrow, to beai
cheerful testimony to the pleasing amenity with which he presided over
the deliberations of this council chamber as the Chancellor of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and sharing as we all do in a profound admiration
for the intelligence he brought to our discussions, while ever moder-
ating them by the guidance of his clear thought and mild wisdom, we can
but render our reverent homage to the eng aging @ personal qualities which
endeared him to us as a man; while at ‘the same time gratefully con-
fessing our obligations to him for the provident care and deep interest
which. he always brought to the discharge of his official duties in this
place, where through all the years of his honorable and useful service
at the head of this Board, the Secretary of the Institution, in common
with ourselves, has lea aned on him as the wise and true counsellor who
could be trusted as well for the rectitude of his moral intuitions as for
the clear perceptions of his calm and judicious intellect.

Resolved, That we will attend tbe funeral of our departed Chancellor
in a body, and that the Secretary of the Institution, together with a
deputation from the members of the Board, be requested to accompany
the other friends and associates of the late Chief. Justice, who will bear
his remains to their last resting-place in Ohio.

Resolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the
Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send a copy of them to
the family of our departed friend, in token of our sincere condolence
with them in their great affliction.

It only remains for your Secretary to add that, in accordance with
your request, he proceeded to Toledo, where he was joined by one of
your body, Dr. J. B. Angell, and in his company paid the final tribute
of respect, by representing your honorable body at the obsequies of
this eminent and good man.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 77
PROFESSOR BAIRD.

I have referred, at the beginning of this report, to the death of the late
Secretary. Both the greatness of the loss to science and to this Insti-
tution make me feel the need of speaking again and more particularly
both of him and of bis work.

When, in January, 1887, the Secretary asked of your honorable body
authority to appoint two assistant secretaries to relieve him from the
growing burden of his official occupations, it was doubtless with the
consciousness that his failing strength no longer permitted the contin-
uous attention to his varied duties which he had previously, with ready
zeal, bestowed. When, under the imperative orders of his physician, he
withdrew himself (as much as his active mental interest permitted)
from the executive operations of his position, the comparative relaxa-
tion of effort and responsibility seemed to have been accepted too late
to give him its expected relief and recuperation ; and his exhausted
powers continued to decline until he quietly breathed his last, on the
afternoon of the 19th of August, 1887, at the headquarters of the U.S.
Commission of Fisheries, at Wood’s Holl.

In recognition of his distinguished services, a bill was introduced in
the Senate of the United States, and passed by that body February 10,
1888, making an appropriation for the erection of a bronze statue to
commemorate his merits.

A bill was also introduced in the Senate for the benefit of his widow.

At aspecial meeting of the Board of Regents, held November 18,
1887, the following resolutions were passed :

Whereas, in the dispensation of Divine Providence, the mortal life
of Spencer Fullerton Baird was ended on the 19th of August last, the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, now at the earliest practicable
moment assembled, desire to express and torecord their profound sense
of the great loss which this Institution has thereby sustained, and
which they personally have sustained. And they accordingly resolve :

1. That, in the lamented death of Professor Baird, the Institution is
bereaved of its honored and efficient Secretary, who has faithfully and
unremittingly devoted to its service his rare administrative abilities for
thirty-seven years—that is, almost from the actual foundation of the
establishment—for the last nine years as its chief executive officer, under
whose sagacious management it has greatly prospered and widely ex-
tended its usefulness and its renown.

2. That the National Museum, of which this Institution is the ad-
ministrator, and the Fish Commission, which is practically affiliated to
it, both organized and in ajust sense created by our late Secretary, are
by this bereavement deprived of the invaluable and unpaid services of
their indefatigable official head.

3. That the cultivators of science, both in this country and abroad,
have to deplore the loss of a veteran and distinguished naturalist, who
was from early years a sedulous and successful investigator ; whose
hative gifts and whose experience in systematic biolegical work served
in no small degree to adapt him to the administrative duties which
filled the later years of his life, but whose knowledge and whose inter-
est in science widened aud deepened as the opportunities for special
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

investigation lessened, and who accordingly used his best endeavors
to promote the researches of his fellow naturalists in every part of
a world.

. That his kindly disposition, equable temper, singleness of aim, and
ere purity of motive, along with his facile mastery of affairs,
greatly endeared him to his subordinates, secured to him the confidence
and trust of those whose influence he sought for the advancement of
the interests he had at heart, and won the high regard and warm af-
fection of those who, like the members of this Board, were officially and
intimately associated with him.

5. That, without intrudiug into the domain of private sorrow, the
Regents of the Institution would respectfully offer to the family of their
late Secretary the assurance of their profound sympathy.

6. That the Regents invite the near associate of the late Secretary,
Professor Goode, to prepare a memorial of the life and services of Pro-
fessor Baird for publication in the ensuing annual report of the Insti-
tution.

The address made by Maj. J. W. Powell, an old and personal friend
of the late Secretary, at the memorial meeting held by the scientific
societies of Washington January 11, 1888, containe:l so just and elo-
quent a tribute to Professor Ran memory, that I feel inclined to
quote from it a few words which, it seems to me, will characterize the
large purpose and attainment of his life, and its relation to others, bet-
ter than any of my own:

‘¢ Baird was one of the learned men of the world. He knew the birds
of the air; he knew the beasts of the forests and the prairies, and the
reptiles that crawl through desert sands or slimy marshes; he knew
the fishes that scale mountain torrents, that bask in quiet lakes, or that
journey from zone to zone through the deep waters of the sea. The
treasures of the land did not satisfy the desires of Baird; he must also
have the treasures of the sea, and so he organized a fish commission,
with its great laboratories and vessels of research.

“The Fish Commission was an agency of research ; but it was more ;
he made it an ageney by which science is applied to the relief of the
wants of mankind—by which a che: ap, nutritious, healthful, and luxuri-
ous food is to be given to the millions of men.

“In the research thus organized the materials for the work of other
scientific men were ¢ eathered. He incited the men personally to under-

take and continuously prosecute their investigations. He enlisted the

men himself; he trained them himself; he himself furnished them with
the materials and instruments of res se: ich, and, best of all, was their
guide and great exemplar. Thus it was that the three institutions
over which | he presided—the Smithsonian Institution, the National
Museum, and the Fish Commission—were woven into one great organi-
zation, a university of instruction in the methods of scientific Reece
including in its scope the entire field of biology and anthropology

corn his work with his assistants, he scrupulously provided that: every
one should receive the meed of honor due for successful research, and

sated all with generosity. Many an investigation begun by himself,
was turned over to assistants when he found that v: uluable conclusions
could be reached ; and these assistants, who were his warm friends, lis
younger brothers, reaped the reward ; ‘and he had more joy over every
young man’s success than over the triumphs and honors heaped upon
himself from every quarter of the globe. He was the sympathetic coun-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

selor of many men; into his ears were poured the sorrows and joys of
others, and he mourned with the mourning, and rejoiced with the re-
joicing. His life at home was pure and sweet and full of joys, for he
gave and received love and trust and tender care. But the history of
his home life is sacred.

“Wor many long months he contemplated the day of parting. Labor
that knew no rest, responsibility that was never lifted from his shoulders,
too soon brought his life to an end. In the summer of the past year he
returned to his work by the sea-side, that he might die in its midst.
There at Wood’s Holl he had created the greatest biologic laboratory of
the world ; and in that laboratory, with the best results of his life-work
all about him, he calmly and philosophically waited for the time of
times.”

The memorial which is being prepared, in obedience to the desire of
the Regents, by the Assistant Secretary of the Institution, is partly writ-
ten, but the pressure of official work has prevented its completion in
time for publication in the present report.

It seems essential, however, that this report should not be pub-
lished without at least a brief biographical sketch of my predecessor

from one of his scientific family, and the following notice, which antici-
pates the coming fuller memorial by Dr. Goode, has accordingly been
prepared by him at my request.

“ Spencer Fullerton Baird was born February 3, 1523, in Reading, a
town in southeastern Pennsylvania about 60 miles from Philadelphia,
where his ancestors, people of education and prominent in the commu-
nity, had lived for several generations. About 1834 his mother, then a
widow, removed to Carlisle. Carlisle was the seat of Deities Col-
lege, whore he was graduated in 1840, at the age of seventeen. His
tastes for scientific investigation had already developed in such a re-
markable manner that his mother felt that she was justified in allowing
him, after graduation, to devote himself for a time to his favorite pur-
suits, and his time for several years was devoted to studies in general
natural history, to long pedestrian excursions for the purpose of observ-
ing animals and Pianes and collecting specimens, and to the organiza-
tion of a private cabinet of natural history, which a few years later be-
came the nucleus of the museum of the Smithsonian Institution. During
this period he published a number of original papers on natural his-
tory. There were at that time no schools for young naturalists, and
his education was in large degree self-directed ; during this time, how-
ever, he partially completed a course in medicine at the College of
Physicans and Surgeons in New York,* and drew inspiration and in-
struction from such men as Audubon and others of the older natural-
ists whom at this period he visited, forming the foundation of lifelong
friendships. His home studies continued for six years, and were
scarcely interrupted by his election in 1841 to the chair of natural his-

* He read medicine w ith Dr, Middleton Goldsmith, and attended a winter course of
lectures at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, in 1342. His medical
course was never formally completed, although in 1848 he received the degree of
M. D., honoris causa, from the Philadelphia Medical College.
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tory and chemistry in his own college, where he remained until 1850,
having married, meantime, Miss Mary H. Churchill, the daughter of
General Sylvester Churchill, U. S. Army, for many years Inspector-
General.

‘¢The inheritance of a love of nature and a taste for scientific classi-
fication, together with the companionship of a brother similarly gifted,
tended to the development of the young naturalist. In 1841, at theage
of eighteen, we find him making an ornithological excursion through
the mountains of Pennsylvania, walking 400 miles in twenty-one days,
the last day 60 miles between daylight and rest. The following year
he walked more than 2,200 miles. His fine physique and consequent
capacity for work are doubtless due in part to his outdoor life during
these years.

“The coming of Agassiz to the United States in 1846, was an inspira-
tion to him, and one of the first great works projected by the Swiss sa-
vant was a joint memoir upon the fishes of North America, which was
enthusiastically begun by the young Dickinson professor, but never
brought to the point of publication.

“ Agassiz did not become established in Cambridge until 1848, and it
is to’ Baird rather than to him that should belong the credit of having
introduced into American schools the system of laboratory practice and
field explorations in connection with natural history instruction. Mon-
cure D. Conway, who was one of his pupils, has often told me how fas-
cinating were Professor Baird’s explanations of natural phenomena, and
how the contagion of his enthusiasm spread among his pupils, who fre-
quently followed him through the fields and woods 20 or 30 miles a day.

‘¢ His mentor at this period was the Hon. George P. Marsh, of Vermont,
already prominent in publie affairs, and his warm friend and admirer.*
To him Professor Baird felt that he owed his real start in life, for Mr.
Marsh, feeling that his protégé was disposed to bury himself too deeply
in the technicalities of a specialty, proposed that he should undertake
the translation and editorship of an edition of the ‘ Iconographie Eney-
clopwdia,’ a version of Heck’s Bilder-Atlas, published in connection with
the famous Conversations-Lexikon of Brockhaus. This task, though ex-
ceedingly laborious and confining to a young man of twenty-six, en-
tirely untrained in literary methods, was efficiently and rapidly per-
formed, and resulted in a great extension of his tastes and sympathies,
while the training which he acquired was an excellent preparation for
the tremendous literary tasks which he undertook without hesitation
in later years. It was also to the interest of Mr. Marsh, who was one
of the earliest Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, that he owed his
nomination to the position of Assistant Secretary of that Institution,
then recently organized, which he accepted July 5, 1850, and October
3, at the age of twenty-seven years, entered upon his life-work in con-

“In Mrs. Caroline Marsh’s lately published biography of her ‘husband many inter-
esting letters from Mr. Marsh to Professor Baird are quoted.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81

nection with that foundation, “ the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” His appointment, if we may judge from a statement in
Professor Henry’s fifth report, was due quite as much to his training
in editorial methods as to his professional acquirements. His appoint-
ment, it is stated, was made at this time more particularly in order that
his services might be secured to take charge of the publications, ana
that the Institution might take advantage of the ample experience which
he had gained in this kind of work.

“Tt was, of course, impossible that the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution could have appreciated the fact that he had invented, in
connection with his work upon his own private collections, a system of
museum administration which was to be of the utmost value in the de-
velopment of the great National Museum which he afterward was instru-
mental in founding. All the elaborate and efficient methods of admin-
istration which are now in use in the National Museum were present,
in germ at least, in the little private museum which grew up under
his control at home, and which he brought with him in a single freight
car to form the nucleus of the great Smithsonian collections.* Among
the treasures of this collection, which are still cherished by the Institu-
tion, were a number of the choicest bird skins collected by Audubon,
who had always felt for him a sincere friendship from the time when
he proposed to the boy of seventeen that he should accompany him on
a voyage to the headwaters of the Missouri, and become his partner in
the preparation of a great work on the quadrupeds of North America,
which afterward he brought out in conjunction with Bachman, of South
Carolina.

“The first grant made by the Institution for scientific exploration

* The only specimens in possession of the Institution at the time of his arrival were
a few boxes of minerals and plants. The collections of the Wilkes Exploring Expedi-
tion, which constitute the legal foundation of the National Museum of the United
States, were at that time under the charge of the National Institute; and although
by the act of incorporation the Smithsonian Institution was the legal custodian of
the national cabinet of curiosities, it was not until 1857 that the Regents finally ac-
cepted the trust, and the National Museum was definitely placed under the control
of the Smithsonian Institution and transferred to its building. Until this time Con-
gress had granted no funds for the support of the Smithsonian cabinets, and the collee-
tions had been acquired and cared for at the expense of the endowment fund. They
had, however, become so large and important in 1857 that the so-called ‘‘ National
Collection” at that time acquired was small in comparison.

The National Musenm thus had a double origin. Its actual although not its legal
nucleus was the collection gathered in the Smithsonian building prior to 1857. Its
methods of administration, which were in fact the very same that had been developed
by Professor Baird in Carlisle as early as 1845, are those which are still in use, and
which have stood the test of thirty years without any necessity for their modification
becoming apparent. In the Fifth Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution, now
exceedingly rare, is a report by the assistant seeretary in charge of the natural his-
tory department, for the year 1850, which enumerates the specimens belonging to the
Museum on Jannary 1, 1851, including a full account of his own deposit.

82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and field research was in 1848 to Spencer F. Baird, of Carlisle, for the
exploration of the bone caves and the local natural history of south-
eastern Pennsylvania.

“From the start the department of explorations was under his
charge, and in his reports to the Secretary, published year by year in
the annual report of the Institution, may be found the only systematic
record of Government explorations which has ever been prepared.

“The decade beginning with 1850 was a period of great activity in
exploration. Our frontier was being rapidly extended toward the
West, but in the territory between the Mississippi and the Pacific coast
were immense stretches of country practically unknown. Numerous
Government expeditions were sent forth, and immense collections in
every department of natural history were gathered and sent to Wash-
ington to be studied and reported upon. The Smithsonian Institution
had been designated by law the custodian of these collections, and
within the walls of its buildings assembled the naturalists by whose
exertions these collections had been brought together. Professor Baird

yas surrounded by conditions most congenial and stimulating, for he
found full scope for his administrative skill in the work of arranging
the scientific outfits for these expeditions, preparing instructions for
the explorers, and above all in inspiring them with enthusiasm for the
work. To him also fell in large part the task of receiving the collec-
tions, arranging for the necessary investigations, and the collation and
publication of their results. The natural histery portions of the re-
ports of the Mexican boundary survey, the Pacific Railroad surveys, the
expeditions of Ives, Emory, Stansbury, and others, were under his su-
pervision, as well as, in considerable degree, the natural history collec-
tions of the Wilkes exploring expedition, which were still under inves-
tigation. :

“The period of the civil war was one of comparative quiet, but much
was accomplished by Baird and his pupils, and two of his most impor-
tant memoirs, viz, Review of North American Birds and The Distribu-
tion and Migrations of North American Birds, were published. During
this decade, too, continued the summer expeditions usually extending
over three months, which were becoming yearly more and more exclu-
sively devoted to the investigation of marine life, and which ultimately
led to the organization of the Fish Commission in 1871. During the
latter part of this decade the early impressions of his work in connec-
tion with the Iconographic Encyclopedia began to revive, and a new
interest was shown by Professor Baird in the popularization of scien-
tific subjects. At the solicitation of Mr. George W. Childs, in 1867 he
began to devote a column to scientific intelligence in the Philadelphia
Public Ledger, and about 1870 he became the scientific editor of the
periodicals published by the Harper Brothers, of New York. His con-
nection with this firm continued until 1878, and in addition to the weekly
and monthly issues there resulted eight annual volumes of the Annual
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

Record of Seience and Industry, the successor of the Annual of Seien-
tific Discovery, established by David A. Wells, in 1850. When Pro-
fessor Baird became Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution bis edito-
rial labors were abandoned, but the idea of his Annual Record of Science
and Industry was continued in the yearly appendices to the Smithsonian
report under the title of Record of Progress, and the scientific work of
the world for as many consecutive years is passed in review in the thirty-
eight volumes which combine the three series just referred to.

“In the memoir which the writer is preparing it is his intention to
discuss in detail the great labors of Professor Baird in scientifie admin-
istration and investigation, but his life was so full that it is only by
careful condensation that even an outline of its eventful features can
be brought within the brief limits of this notice.

‘There may be noted in the career of Professor Baird several dis-
tinct phases of activity, namely: (1) A period of twenty-six years
(1843-1869) occupation in laborious investigation and voluminous pub-
lication upon the vertebrate fauna of North America; (2) forty years
(1840-1880) of continuous contribution to scientific editorship; (3) five
years (1845-1850) devoted to educational work; (4) forty-four years
(1843-1887) devoted to the encouragement and promotion of scientific
enterprises and the development of new workers among the young men
with whom he was brought in contact; (5) thirty-seven years (1550-
1887) devoted to administrative work as an officer of the Smithsonian
Institution and in charge of the scientific collections of the Government,
twenty-eight (1850-1878) as principal executive officer, and nine (1878—
1887) as Secretary and responsible head; (6) sixteen years (1871-1837)
as head of the Fish Commission, a philanthropic labor for the increase
of the food supply of the world, and, incidentally, in promoting the
interests of biological and physical investigation of the waters.

“The extent of his contributions to science and scientific literature
may be at least partially comprehended by an examination of the bib-
liography of his publications issued by the Institution in 1883.* The
list of his writings is complete to the end of the year 1882, and contains
1,063 titles. Of this number, 775 are brief notices and critical reviews
contributed to the Annual Record of Science and Industry, while under
his editorial charge; 31 are reports relating tothe work of the Smith-
sonian Institution; 7 are reports upon the American fisheries ; 25 are
schedules and circulars officially issued, and 25 are volumes or papers
edited. Outof the remaining 200 the majority are formal contributions
to scientific literatnre, among them the two classical works upon the
Mammals of North America and the Birds of North America (Volumes
Vill and 1x of the Pacific Railroad Reports). These were the only ex-
tended systematic treatises upon those groups which bad at that time
been prepared, of scope suflicient to embrace the fauna of the entire
continent. They are still standard works of reference, and every spec-

merit.

“Of the total number of papers enumerated in the list, 73 relate to
mammals, 80 to birds, 43 to reptiles, 431 to fishes, 61 to invertebrates
(these being chiefly reviews), 16 to plants, 85 to geographical distribu-
tion, 46 to geology, mineralogy, and paleontology; 45 to anthropology,
31 to industry and art, and 109 to exploration and travel.

“While the number of new species deseribed does not necessarily
afford any clew to the value of the work accomplished, it may not be
uninteresting to refer to it as an indication of the pioneer work which
it was necessary to do even in so prominent a group as the vertebrates.

logue of serpents not more than 60 per cent. had been named, and in
preparation for studying the specimens each was carefully ticketed with
its locality, and then the 2,000 or more individuals were thrown indis-
criminately into one erent pile, and the work of sorting them out by
resemblances was begun. Not the least valuable have been the numer-
ous accurate figures of North American vertebrates, prepared under
Professor Baird’s supervision. These include representatives of 170
species of mammals and 160 species of reptiles, besides many hundreds
of birds.

“On the 9th of February, 1874, Congress passed a joint resolution
which authorized the appointment of a Commissioner of Fish and Fish-
eries. The duties of the Commissioner were thus defined: ‘To prose-
cute investigations on the subject (of the diminution of valuable fishes)
with the view of ascertaining whether any and what diminution in the
number of the food-fishes of the coast and the lakes of the United
States has taken place, and, if so, to what causes the same is due; and
also whether any and what protective, prohibitory, or precautionary
measures should be adopted in the premises, and to report upon the
same to Congress,’

“The resolution establishing the office of Commissioner of Fisheries
required that the person to be appoipted should be a civil officer of the
Government, of proved scientific and practical acquaintance with the
fishes of the coast, to serve without additional salary. The choice was
thus practically limited to a single man. Professor Baird, at that time
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was appointed, and,
at once entering upon his duties, soon developed a systematic scheme
of investigation.

*“ The Fish Commission now fills a place tenfold more exteusive and
useful than at first. Its work is naturally divided into three sections :

“(1) The systematic investigation of the waters of the United States
and the biological and physical problems which they present. The
scientific studies of the Commission are based upon a liberal and phil-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85

osophical interpretation of the law. In making his original plans the
Commissioner insisted that to study only food-fishes would be of little
importance, and that useful conclusions must needs rest upon a broad
foundation of investigations purely scientific in character. The life his-
tory of species of economic value should be understood from beginning
to end, but no less requisite is it to know the histories of the animals
aud plants upon which they feed or upon which their food is nourished ;
the histories of their enemies and friends, and the friends and foes of
their enemies and friends, as well as the currents, temperatures, and
other physical phenomena of the waters in relation to migration, repro-
duction, and growth. A necessary accom) lishment to this division is
the amassing of material for research to be stored in the National and
other museums for future use.

“(2) The investigation of the methods of fisheries, past and present,
and the statistics of production and commerce of fishery products. Man
being one of the chief destroyers of fish, his influence upon their abun-
dance must be studied. Fishery methods and apparatus must be ex-
amined and compared with those of other lands, that the use of those
which threaten the destruction of useful fishes may be discouraged,
and that those which are inefficient may be replaced by others more
serviceable. Statistics of industry and trade must be secured for the
use of Congress in making treaties or imposing tariffs, to show to pro-
ducers the best markets, and to consumers where and with what their
needs may be supplied.

“(3) Theintroduction and multiplication of useful food fishes through-
out the country, especially in waters under the jurisdiction of the Gen-
eral Government, or those common to several States, none of which
might feel willing to make expenditures for the benefit of the others.
This work, which was not contemplated when the Commission was es-
tablished, was first undertaken atthe instance of the American Fish
Cultural Association, whose representatives induced Congress to make
a special appropriation for the purpose.

‘‘ His relation to the organizations with which he was so closely iden-
tified, the Smithsonian Institution, its ward, the National Museum, and
the Fish Commission, can in this place only be incidentally mentioned,
and the numerous biographical notices which have appeared since his
death have not failed to review critically the significance of his connee-
tion with them and his influence upon them. To his friends who knew
him best and miss him most it seems pleasanter to dwell upon the ree-
ognition which his labors received than upon the labors themselves, his
devotion to which shortened his life so many years.

* Almost every civilized country in the world has paid him nonor,
In 1875 he received the decoration of Knight of the Royal Norwegian
order of St. Olaf from the King of Norway and Sweden. In 1873 he
was awarded the silver medalof the Acclimatization Society of Mel-
bourne, and in 1879 the gold medal of the Société dAcclimation of
France. In 1856 he received the degree of doctor of physical science
from Dickinson College, and in 1875 that of doctor of laws from Co-
lumbian University. A few months before his death, on the occasion of
the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Harvard University, the
same degree, ad eundem, Was conferred on him as an eminent promoter of
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

science. This was one of the few oceasions upon which he was induced
to ascend the platform in a public place. He was one of the early mem-
bers of the National Academy of Sciences, and ever since the organiza-
tion was a member of its council. In 1850 and 1851 he served as per-
manent secretary of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, and since 1878 was one of the trustees of the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, Washington. He was a president of the Cosmos Club,
and for many years a trustee of Columbian University. Among his
honorary relations to numerous scientific societies of the United States
and other countries are included those of foreign membership in the Lin-
niean Society of London and the Zoological Society of London, hon-
orary membership in the Linnean Society of New South Wales, and cor-
responding membership in the K. K. Zoologisch-botanische Gesellschaft,
Vienna; the Sociedad de Geographia, Lisbon; the New Zealand Insti.
tute; the Koninklijke Natuurkundige Vereeniging in Nederlandsch
Indié, Batavia; the Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia, Buda-Pesth; the
Société Nationale des Sciences Naturelles, Cherbourg; the Academia
Germanica Nature Curiosorum, Jena; the Naturforschende Gesellschaft,
Halle; the Naturhistorische Gesellschaft, Nuremberg; the Geograph-
ical Society, of Quebec; the Historical Society of New York; the
Deutsche Fischerei- Verein, Berlin.

“The nomenclature of zoology contains many memorials of his con-
nection with its history. A partial enumeration shows that over twenty-
five species and one genus of fishes bears his name, and that not less
than forty species have been named in his honor. These will for all
time be monuments to his memory as undying as the institutions which
he founded.

‘“* A post-office in Shasta County, Cal., located near the McCloud River
Salmon Hatching Station of the U. S. Fish Commission, was named
Baird by the Postmaster-General in 1877.

“Even Japan was not unmindful of Professor Baird’s services to
science, for from distant Yezo, the most northern island of the Japanese
Archipelago, came, soon after his death, a little volume beautifully
printed upon silk, containing his portrait and the story of his char-
acter.

“The importance of his services to fish-culture was perhaps more
fully recognized in Germany than in any other country, not excluding
the United States. In 1880, on the occasion of the first great Inter-
national Fishery Exhibition held in Berlin, his name was found to be
widely known among the scientific men there present. The magnificent
silver trophy which was the chief prize was awarded to him by the
Emperor William. This now stands in the fishery hall of the National
Museum. While Professor Baird’s portrait hung over the entrance to
the American section at Berlin, the Kammerherr von Behr, the presi-
dent of the German Fishery Union, the most powerful and influential
fishery organization in the world, never passed under it without taking

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87

off his hat in honor of the ‘ first fish-culturist of the world,’ as he de-
lighted to call him. He also insisted that any who might be in his
company should pay the same respect to Professor Baird. Indeed, L
am not sure that the late Emperor Frederick, at that time Crown Prince
and protector of the German fisheries, did not do homage in this way
tothe American philanthropist. After Professor Baird’s death a cir-
cular was issued by the German Fishery Union which contained a most
appreciative eulogy.

‘¢ His ever ready assistance to his fellow-workers in Europe won for
him their deep regard. Mr. R. Bowdler Sharpe, of the British Museum,
writes as follows to Nature: ‘As chief of the Smithsonian Institution
Professor Baird possessed a power of conferring benefits to the world
of science exercised by few directors of public museums, and the man-
ner in which he has utilized these powers has resulted not only in the
wonderful success of the United States National Museum under his
direction, but in the enrichment of many other museums. We know
by experience that the British Museum is indebted to Professor Baird
beyond measure. We had only to express our wants, and immediately
every effort was made to supply all the desiderata in our ornithological
collection.’

‘¢ Professor Baird was the most modest of men. He seemed never -to
care for public recognition. In speaking of any honors which he had
received he appeared to deprecate what had been done, as if ashamed
of the attentions, feeling himself unworthy to receive them.

‘“ He once remarked to me, some years before his death, that he was
satisfied that no man’s life was of such importance to the people among
whom he lived that he could not shortly be replaced by another who
would fully fill his place. As I looked at the man before me, a giant in
body and in mind, a treasury of untransferable experience and wisdom,
I thought to myself that if this judgment was a true one (which I did
not believe, nor, at bis heart, [ suppose, did be), in him at least there
was an exception. I speak not now of his official usefulness alone, but
of the broader and more essential relationships which he held to science
and to humanity.

‘“ Such a man has a thousand sides, each most familiar to a few, and
perhaps entirely strange to the greater part of those who know him.

“ Future historians of American science will be better able than are
we to estimate justly the value of the contributions to scientific litera-
ture which are enumerated in his bibliography; but no one not living
in the present can form an accurate idea of the personal influence of #
leader upon his associates and upon the progress of thought in his
special department, nor can such an influence as this well be set down
in words. This influence is apparently due not only to extraordinary
skill in organization, to great power of application and concentration
of thought constantly applied, and to a philosophical and comprehen-
88 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sive mind, but to an entire and self-sacrificing devotion to the interests
of his work and that of others.

‘« His extreme diffidence and lack of self-seeking were among his con-
Spicuous, characteristics. He was always averse to addressing audi-
ences, and this is all the more remarkable to his friends, who remem-
ber how winning and persuasive his eloquence was when he talked in
the presence of a few. His ability as a talker and organizer was never
better seen than when, as already observed, in the presence of Con-
gressional committees, before whom he was summoned from year to
year to give reasous for his requests for money to be used in expanding
the work of the Fish Commission or the National Museum. He was
always received by the members with the heartiest welcome; and it
seemed that always these pushing, brusque men of business, who ordi-
narily rushed with the greatest haste through the routine of committee
work, forgot their usual hurry when Professor Baird was before them.
They listened attentively as long as he could be induced to talk about
his plans for the development of the organizations whose success he
had at heart. Not unfrequently they would wander from the business
before them as they asked him questions upon subjects which his sug-
gestive remarks impressed upon their attention.

‘‘No man was more easily approached than Professor Baird. He
seemed especially fond of meeting young persons, whom he immedi-
ately set at their ease by his geniality and frankness of manner. A
writer in the Nation has said: ‘it seemed as if in his mind he had an
epitome of all the characteristics of mind and habit of each and every
man. No thought of self seemed to enter into his calculations. Those
who felt themselves the object cf his personal regard sometimes halted
for a moment in a comical dismay, perceiving themselves frankly moved,
like chessmen, in directions which they would not themselves have se-
lected, but an overwhelming sense of Baird’s entire devotion to the
promotion of science, his perfect unselfishness, and his incomparable
good judgment, always carried the day.’

“From his early youth until his failing strength forbade, he kept a
journal of his daily pursuits, and this, together with the immense piles
of copy-books and files of letters received, will afford a boundless treas-
ure to his biographer; and when his biography is written, if it be prop-
erly done in accordance with the modern theory of biography-making,
it will form essentially a history of the natural sciences in America for
the past half century.

‘For many months before his death he knew that his life was drawing
to a close. In the summer of 1887, a few weeks before he died, he went
to Wood’s Holl, as usual, to direct the operations of the Fish Commission.
Of all the tributes to his character none were more eloquent or touching
than one at the funeral service at Wood’s Holl. The simple burial
service was read, and then the clergyman recited these sentences from
the Sermon on the Mount: ‘Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 89
mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed
are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God.’ So
appropriate were these words that scarcely one of those present could
refrain from tears, realizing how great, how benevolent, how simple-
hearted had been the friend whom they had lost.”

A memorial meeting was held January 11, 1888, in the lecture-room
of the Columbian University of Washington, under the joint auspices of
the Philosophical, Anthropological, and Biological Societies of this city,
at which addresses were made by members of the several societies
commemorating the life and scientific work of Professor Baird.

An oil portrait of Professor Baird, of life-size, painted by Mr. Henry
Ulke, of this city, was purchased by the Regents for the Institution.

PROFESSOR ASA GRAY, REGENT.

In addition to the loss of our honored Chancellor and Secretary, the
Institution has further been called upon to mourn the decease of one of
the oldest and most distinguished members of the Board of Regents,
Dr. Asa Gray, whose death took place on the 30th day of January last
(1888), and brought the mournful loss not only of a great man of sci-
ence, intimately and long connected with the Institution, but of one
personally endeared to all who knew him.

Professor Gray may be said to have been identified with the Institu-
tion from its very beginning as a chosen and trusted counselor of its
first Secretary, and an active member of the Board from January, 1874.

Born in the town of Paris, Oneida County, N. Y., on the 18th of No-
vember, 1810, Professor Gray was at the time of his death, therefore,
over seventy-seven years of age, though few would have so supposed,
judging from his continued activity and vigor. He was graduated at
the Fairfield College of Physicians and Surgeons, Herkimer County,
N.Y., in 1831, as doctor of medicine. Relinquishing, however, his pro-
fession, he devoted himself to the study of botany under Professor
Torrey ; and he prosecuted for years this branch of natural history
with such zeal and energy as ultimately to even surpass the fame of
his distingushed preceptor, and to become the acknowledged chief of
American naturalists in his chosen field.

In 1842 he was elected the Fisher professor of natural history at
Harvard College,a position he retained for more than thirty years.
From this college he received, in 1844, the degree of A. M., and from
Hamilton College, in 1860, the degree of LL. D. He published various
botanical manuals and systematic treatises, several of which became
universally-accepted popular text-books. He was one of the original
members of the National Academy of Sciences, incorporated by act
of Congress March 3, 1863. From 1863 to 1873 he was president of the
90 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and was president of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science for the year 1872.

More than forty years ago, in the very infancy of this Institution, Dr.
Gray, at the instance of its Secretary, undertook to prepare for publica-
tion, under its auspices, a comprehensive illustrated work on American
Forest Trees. In the Secretary’s third report (for 1849) it is recorded,
with reference to contemplated ‘Reports on the Progress of Knowledge,”
that ‘the most important report now in progress is that on the Forest
Trees of North America, by Dr. Gray, professor of botany in Harvard
University. It is intended in this work to give figures from original
drawings of the flowers, leaves, fruit, etc., of each principal species in
the United States proper, for the most part of the size of nature, and
so executed as to furnish colored or uncolored copies; the first being
intended to give an adequate idea of the species, and the second for
greater cheapness and more general diffusion. This work will be com-
pleted in three parts, in octavo, with an atlas of quarto plates, the first
to be published next spring. - - - As the work will be adapted to
general comprehension, it will be of interest to the popular as well as
the scientific reader.”

This very interesting and important enterprise, delayed by Dr. Gray’s
visit to Europe the following year, and afterward from time to time
postponed by various hindrances, was never completed. Simultaneously
with his engagement upon this great work, other interests and investi-
gations were pressing upon his attention. A botanical expedition—
assisted by the Institution—made by Mr. Oharles Wright, through
Texas and New Mexico in the summer and autumn of 1849, was re-
warded by an extensive and valuable collection of the plants of these
regions, which were placed in the hands of Dr. Gray; and in 1851 it
was announced that his report on this new material was ready for pub-
lication. This memoir was issued in two parts, quarto size. Part 1,
comprising 146 pages of text, illustrated by ten engraved plates, was
included in Vol. 111 of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,
and Part 1, comprising 119 pages, illustrated by 4 plates, was included
in Vol. v of Contributions to Knowledge.

In the winter of 185455 Dr. Gray delivered, in the lecture-room of
this Institution, a course of nine lectures “ On Vegetation.”

In 1884, Dr. Gray presented to Harvard College his herbarium, con-
taining more than 200,000 specimens, and his botanical library of more
than 2,500 works ; for the reception of which a fire-proof building was
provided. In 1873, he resigned his professorship in the college, retain-
ing, however, the charge of its herbarium. In 1874, he was selected by
joint resolution of Congress a Regent of this Institution, taking the
place made vacant by the death of Professor Agassiz, who had been a
Regent for the preceding ten years.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91
DR. PETER PARKER, EX-RHGENT.

While recounting the inroads made by death on the earlier por-
tion of the membership of the Institution and its Board of Regents, it
seems proper to notice also the demise of Dr. Peter Parker, who had
been a Regent from 1868 to 1884, when he was induced to resign his
position on the Board in consequence of infirmity and failing health.
His death occurred at his residence in this city on the 10th day of Jan--
uary last (1888).

The stated annual meeting of the Board occurring on the following
day (January 11, 1885), expression was given to the regret occasioned
thereby, in the following preamble and resolution:

Whereas the Board has received the afflictive intelligence that the
venerable Dr. Peter Parker, who for sixteen years was a member of the
Board of Regents, and who for this whole period served with fidelity
on its executive committee, has departed this life after a long career
filled with useful labors in the service of God and of man: Therefore,

Be it resolved, That in the retrospect of such a life-career, protracted
as it was beyond the limit usually allotted to men, and yet at each stage
of its progress dedicated to beneficent works in the cause of religion,
philanthropy, and science, we desire to testify our respect for the exalted
worth and serupulous conscientiousness which Dr. Parker brought to
the discharge of every duty, and which during his connection with the
government of this Institution were nobly exemplified by the zeal and
diligence with which he ever watched and worked for its prosperity and
usefulness, even during the later period of his honorable service, when
the burden of years was added to the burden of official cares, and when
with a less conscientious sense of public duty he might have claimed
an exemption from the tasks of life.

DR. CHARLES RAU, CURATOR OF ANTIQUITIES.

Dr. Charles Rau, for many years in charge of the department of an-
tiquities in the National Museum, was born in Belgium in 1826. He
lived for a time in Germany and as a political exile came to America
thirty years ago, landing at New Orleans December 23, 1848; lived for
a time in Saint Louis; engaged in teaching at Belleville, Il., and later
went to New York City, still occupied as a teacher of languages. He
had always been a deeply interested student of aboriginal remains, and
had written many articles on the prehistoric condition of man. In 1875
he had charge of an exhibition of North American archeology for the
display of the Institution in the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia.

He was in 1881 appointed curator of the department of antiquities
in the National Museum. His health gave way in 1886, and in July,
1887, he went to the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where
he died on the 25th of July. His body was brought to Washington and
was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, where a modest grave-stone bearing
a suitable inscription has been erected to his memory.
oF REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

He bequeathed to the National Museum his library, consisting of 715
bound volumes, and 1,722 volumes unbound; his archwologiea: collec-
tion comprising 1,920 specimens (ethnologic) and his collection of
minerals and fossils.

These objects have been transferred to the Museum by his adminis-
trator, Mr. Thomas Wilson. The books comprising the library are being
arranged and catalogued, and will form the nucleus of a departmental
library. The archeological specimens will be kept together and dis-
played under the name of their donor. Almost the eutire life of Dr.
Rau was spent in archzeologic studies. He was faithful, zealous, and
devoted to science. He had the courage of his convictions and was
ready to defend them before any person or tribunal, however august.
He did what he could for the alleviation of human suffering and regret-
ted he could not do more. The fruits of his scientific labors will be de-
seribed in the Bibliographical Appendix to the Report of the National
Museum in Part II of this Report. —

In addition to the above, mention should be made of the deaths of
the following employés of the Institution:

On June 8, 1888, Charles Wickliffe Beckham, formerly an assistant
in the Department of Birds, died at his home near Bardstown, Ky. He
had made several valuable contributions to American ornithological
literature.

Mrs. L. S. Weaver, clerk and translator, died November 26, 1887.
She had been employed in the Institution since 1876, having been ap-
pointed upon the death of her first husband, L. Stoerzer, at that time
chief taxidermist; and she rendered always willing and efficient service.

Capt. C. W. C. Dunnington, a respected citizen of Washington, for
several years a watchman in the Museum, Frederick R. Parker, a clerk
in the Institution, and Isaac Diggs, for twenty years a laborer and at-
tendant, have also died during the year.

The following notice of Dr. Emil Bessels has been supplied by Dr.
Dall:

Dr. Emil Bessels was born in Heidelberg, June 2, 1847. Educated at
the University, and securing the degree of doctor in medicine, he was
more disposed toward science and belles-lettres than to the practice of
his profession. Being in easy circumstances he was enabled to follow his
natural bent, and for a time was a student in zoology under Van Bene-
den, and an assistant of Krauss at the Naturalien Cabinet, or Royal
Museum of Wiirtemberg in Stuttgart. He became interested in Arctic
discovery, and his first essay in this direction, under the encouragement
of Petermann, of Gotha, was the well-known voyage of 1369 into the
{

q

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

sea between Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla. By his observations on
this journey he traced the influence of the Gulf Stream water east of
Spitzbergen and added much to the scanty knowledge of this region
then available. In 1870 he was called to the field as military surgeon,
rendering services in the hospitals, which brought him a public com-
mendation from the Grand Duke of Baden. In 1871 he came to America
at Petermann’s suggestion to join Hall’s Polar Expedition as naturalist
and surgeon. Most of the scientific results of this voyage were the fruit
of his personal efforts. After the rescue of the survivors he returned
to America, where for some years he was busy at the Smithsonian In-
stitution in preparing for publication the scientific results of the voy-
age, one of the most striking of which was the proof first brought out
by him of the insularity of Greenland, which he deduced from the tidal
observations secured on the expedition. In 1876 his work was printed
in quarto, under the title of “Report on the Scientific Results of the
Polaris Expedition.” Three years later he published through Engle-
mann, at Leipzig, a German narrative of the expedition, illustrated
largely from his own very artistic sketches. He projected a work on the
Eskimo, to which he devoted much labor. An ethnological voyage
undertaken on the United States steamer Saranac to the northwest
coast of America was prematurely terminated by the wreck of that
vessel in Seymour Narrows, British Columbia. He returned to Wash-
ington, where he prepared several contributions to Arctic and zoolog-
ical literature. Through an unfortunate fire at his residence he lost his
library, manuscripts, and collections in 1885, and subsequently returned
to Germany, where he settled at Stuttgart. Here he was engaged in
literary pursuits, the study of art, and in geographical instruction.
He died after a short illness, March 30, 1888, and his remains were in-
terred in the Cemetery, at Heidelberg.
Respectfully submitted.

Secretary of Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT,

APPENDIX I.

PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[Presented in the First Annual Report of the Secretary, and adopted by the Board of Regents, De-
cember 13, 1847.]

INTRODUCTION.—General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a
plan of organization.

1. Will of Smithson. The property is bequeathed to the United States of America
“to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an estab-
lishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The Government of the United States
is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently supposed, but
the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and perpetuate his name.

4. The objects of the Institution are (1) to increase, and (2) to diffuse knowledge
among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another. The first is to
enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition of new truths; and the
second, to disseminate knowledge, thus increased, among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of knowledge;
hence al] branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating and promoting
the discovery of new truths; and can be most extensively diffused among men by
means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should be such as to
enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of increasing and diffusing
knowledge, which can not be produced either at all or so efficiently by the existing
institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provisionally, can be
easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or be abandoned, in whole or in part,
without a sacrifice of the funds.

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time occasioned by the
delay of eight years in establishing the Institution, a considerable portion of the in-
terest which has accrued should be added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated, the funds are
small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the construction of the building ;
and not only the first cost of the edifice should be considered, but also the continual
expense of keeping it in repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily
connected with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently supported
by the Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined by the plan of
the organization, and not the converse.

95
96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be benefited by the be-
quest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure on local objects would be a
perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from the will of
Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of the act of Congress estab-
lishing the Institution. These are, a library, a museum, and a gallery of art, witha
building on a liberal scale to contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing deduc-
tions from the will of Smithson,

To increase knowledge : It proposed (1) to stimulate men of talent to make original
researches, by offering suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths ; and (2)
to appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular researches, under the
direction of suitable persons.

To diffuse knowledge: It is proposed (1) to publish a series of periodical reports on
the progress of the different branches of knowledge; and (2) to publish occasionally
separate treatises on subjectsof general interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.

I. By stimulating researches.—1. Facilities afforded for the production of original
memoirs on all branches of knowledge. 2 The memoirs thus obtained to be pub-
lished ina series of volumes, in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contribu-
tions to Knowledge. 3. No memoir, on subjects of physical science, to be accepted
for publication, which does not furnish a positive addition to human knowledge, rest-
ing on original research ; and all unverified speculations to be rejected. 4. Each me-
moir presented to the Institution to be submitted for examination to a commission of
persons of reputation for learning in the branch to which the memoir pertains ; and to
be accepted for publication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.
5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution, and the name of the
author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a favorable decision be made. 6. The
volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions of literary and scientific
societies, and copies to be given to all the colleges and principal libraries in this
country. One part of the remaining copies may be offered for sale; and the other

institutions. 7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Sy’
DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I. By the publication of a series of reports giving an account of the new discoveries in
science, and of the changes made from year to year in all branches of knowledge not strictly
professional.—l. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally interesting,
but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the reports may be pub-
lished annually, others at longer intervals, as the income of the Institution or the
changes in the branches of knowledge may indicate. 2. The reports are to be prepared
by collaborators eminent in the different branches of knowledge. 3. Each collabo-
rator to be furnished with the journals and publications, domestic and foreign, nec-
essary to the compilation of his report; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and
to be named on the title-page of the report. 4. The reports to be published in sepa-
rate parts, so that persons interested in a particular branch can procure the parts
relating to it without purchasing the whole. 5. These reports may be presented to
Congress for partial distribution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and
scientific institutions and sold to individuals for a moderate price.*

Il. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.—1. These
treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs translated from foreign lan-
guages, or of articles prepared under the direction of the Institution, or procured by
offering premiums for the best exposition of a given subject. 2. The treatises should,
in all cases, be submitted to a commission of competent judges previous to their pub-
lication. 3. Asexamples of these treatises, expositions may be obtaived of the present
state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of the Board
of Regents, providing for the two modes of increasing and diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated the formation of a
library and a museum, and the Board of Regents, including these objects in the plan
of organization, resolved to divide the income into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge by means of pub-
lications and researches, agreeably to the scheme before given. The other part to be
appropriated to the formation of a library and a collection of objects of nature and
of art,

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required, consisting,
first, of a complete collection of the transactions and proceedings of ail the learned
societies in the world; second, of the more important current periodical publications
and other works necessary in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of objects to illus-
trate and verify its own publications. ;

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of experimental

science.

~ *The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in the reports:
I. Physical Class.—(1) Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,

and meteorology. (2) Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, ete. (3)

Agriculture. (4) Application of science to arts.

TL. Moral and Political Class.—(5) Ethnology, including particular history, com-

parative philology, antiquities, ete. (6) Statistics and politicaleconomy. (7) Mental

and moral philosophy. (8) A survey of the political events of the world, penal re-

form, ete. A

Ill. Literature and the Fine Arts.—(9) Modern literature. (10) The fine arts, and
their application to the useful arts, (11) Bibliography, (12) Obituary notices of
flistinguished individuals.

98 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those mentioned above,
catalogues of all the different libraries in the United States should be procured, in
order that the valuable books first purchased may be such as are not to be found in
the United States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials, should be col-
lected for rendering the Institution a center of bibliographical knowledge, whence
the student may be directed to any work which he may require.

9, It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase by donation as
rapidly as the income of the Institution can make provision for their reception, and
therefore it will seldom be necessary to purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts of the most
celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of expense, for the exhi-
bition of the objects of the Art Union and other similar societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of antiquities, such
as those of the remains of ancient temples, etc.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, besides the Secretary,
no permanent assistant will be required, except one to act as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to the Regents. He
shall take charge of the building and property, keep a record of proceedings, dis-
charge the duties of librarian and keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent
of the Regents, employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress, will be required
to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit new objects of art; distin-
guished individuals should also be invited to give lectures on subjects of general in-
terest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has become the settled
policy of the Institution. The only material change is that expressed by the follow-
ing resolutions, adopted January 15, 1855, viz:

Resolved, That the seventh resolution passed by the Board of Regents on the 26th
of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the income between the active opera-
tions and the museum and library, when the buildings are completed, be, and it is
hereby, repealed.

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be apportioned specifically
among the different objects and operations of the Institution in such manner as may,
in the judgmens of the Regents, be necessary and proper for each, according to its
intrinsic importance, and a compliance in good faith with the law.

[Resolution of Board of Regents, adopted January 17, 1880, and at each successive annual meeting. |

Tesolved, That the income for the year be appropriated for the service of the In&ti-
tution upon the basis of the report [of the Executive Committee], to be expended
by the Secretary, with full discretion as to the items, subject to the approval of the
Executive Committee.
APPENDIX II.

PUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAR.
SMITHSONIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.

Of this series, no work has been published during the past year. A memoir on the
archeolegy of North America has been for several years in course of preparation by
Dr. Charles Rau, the late curator of the department of Pre-historic Antiquities, and
several thousand dollars have been expended in the production ef drawings by Mr.
C. F. Trill and others, under Dr. Rau’s direction, for the purpose of properly illus-
trating the work. Dr. Rau’s illness at the beginning of the past fiscal year, and his
death in July, 1887, have arrested the progress of this undertaking. The unfinished
work will, however, be taken up by his successor, Mr. Thomas Wilson, and prosecuted
to an early completion, and it is not improbable that this work may be published in
the above series.

SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

Of this series three volumes have been published duripg the year, besides several
independent treatises. Taking these in the order in which they appear in the printed
lists, they are as follows:

591. ‘‘Synoptical Flora of North America: The Gamopetalie ; being a second edition
of Vol.1, Part u, and Vol. 11, Part 1, collected,” by Asa Gray, LL. D. Of these two
portions, the earlier—the last part of the proposed first volume—comprises 480 pages,
and the latter—being the commencing part of the proposed second volume—com-
prises 494 pages; forming in the aggregate, with introductory matter, an octavo vol-
ume of 986 pages. As long as forty years-ago, Dr. Gray, in co-operation with Dr.
Torrey, undertook a comprehensive classification of the North American flora, which,
however, never was completed, stopping with a synopsis of the polypetalous, and
about half the gamopetalous divisions of the Dicotyledons, or to the close of the
order of Composite. Ambitious of reconstructing and completing the long contem-
plated work, Dr. Gray, postponing the first part of Vol. 1 (the Polypetala), has taken
up, for the second part of the volume, the Gamopetala as far as the completion of the
Composite, and has continued the remaining orders of the Gamopetalw as the first
part of the succeeding volume. The lamented death of the author has left his great
work still unfinished; the third division of the Dicotyledons (the dpetale), and the
Monoctyledons having been designed to form the second part of Vol. 1. The present
two detached portions of successive volumes, however, have a unity in being occupied
entirely with the Gamopelala, and they constitute a full and systematic descriptive
catalogue or synopsis of this great division.

Several thousand dollars have been expended by the Institution in furthering this
important botanical work, which probably cost the author nearly as much more. In
consideration of this, Dr. Gray was allowed to issue for his own benefit a first edition
of the work of 500 copies before the Institution attempted to publish its own edition,
which bas thus only lately appeared.

“Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. xxx1.” This volume is occupied with the two
parts of the “ Flora of North America,” by Dr. Asa Gray, just described ; a separate
edition of 500 copies of the work having been issued as ‘‘No, 591,” for special dis~

tribution, according to the long-established policy of the Institution, and an edition
of 1,000 copies being issued as a numbered volume of the ‘‘ Collections,” for deposit
with the principal libraries and scientific societies of the world.

658. “‘Index to the Literature of the Spectroscope,” by Alfred Tuckerman. This
bibliography is designed to give a list of all the books and smaller treatises, espe-
cially contributions to scientific periodicals, on the spectroscope and spectrum an-
alysis from the beginning of our knowledge upon the subject until July, 1887. The
work is arranged as an alphabetical index to topics as well as of substances which
have been spectroscopically examined, followed by an alphabetical list of the authors.
It comprises 3,829 titles and the names of 799 authors, and forms an octavo volume of
433 pages, including introductory matter and supplement.

659. “‘A Table of Specific Gravity for Solids and Liquids (new edition, revised and
enlarged),” by Frank Wigglesworth Clark. This work is a revised edition, entirely
re-written, of specific gravity tables, by the same author, published by this Institu-
tion December, 1873, and a supplement to the same, published April, 1876. ‘The
melting and boiling temperature appended to many of the substances in these earlier
tables have been omitted in the present. A general idea of the expansion given to
this important series of density determinations may be suggested by the statement
that the original work gave a list of 2,263 different substances, to which the supple-
ment added nearly 700 more, while the present work presents a list of 5,227 distinct
substances. And as many of the substances have had their specific. gravities inde-
pendently investigated by several eminent chemists, with slight variations in their
results, it may be well to add that the tables actually include 14,465 separate deter-
minations of these constants, averaging about two and three-fourths independent ex-
aminations to every substance catalogued. The large mass of material thus ex-
hibited furnishes a creditable record, both of the rapid extension of minute chemical
investigation in the last dozen years and of the diligence of the present compiler, Mr.
Clark, who has himself, moreover, done very meritorious work in the direction of
specific gravity determinations.

The work forms an octavo volume of 417 pages in all, and it is under consideration
whether it may not be well, in view of the interest of chemists in the table and the
demand for them, to put the sale copies in the hand of a publisher.

660. ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collections,” Vol. xxx. This volume is made up of the
two works last mentioned, in the order, first, Clark’s Table of Specific Gravity ; second,
Tuckerman’s Bibliography of Spectroscopic Analysis. It forms an octavo volume of
855 pages.

661. ‘‘ Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington,” Vols. 1x, x. Contain-
ing the minutes of the society and of the mathematical section for the years 1886,
1887, together with the proceedings of the Baird memorial meeting, held January 11,
1888. ‘The bulletin for these two years forms an octavo volume of 376 pages, embel-
lished with a phototype likeness of Professor Baird.

662. ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collections,” Vol. xxx111. This volume consists entirely of
the bulletins of the Philosophical Society of Washington, and is made up of No. 543.
Bulletin, Vol. vi, for the year 1883; No. 592, Bulletin, Vol. vu, for the year 1884; No.
636, Bulletin, Vol. vim, for the year 1885, and No. 661, just previously described,
Bulletin, Vol. 1x, for 1886, and Vol. x, for 1887. The following note is appended to
the general table of contents on page 5: ‘‘ With this volume (containing the last five
volumes of the bulletins of the Philosophical Society of Washington) is terminated
the re-issue of these proceedings in the series of Miscellaneous Collections. It may
be stated that volumes 1, 2, and 3 of these bulletins formed Vol. xx of the Miscella-
neous Collections; volumes 4 and 5 were included in Vol. xxv of the Miscellaneous
Collections; and, lastly, volumes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, together with the Memorial Pro-
ceedings in honor of Professor Baird, and a full index of the whole ten volumes, con-
stitute the present Vol. xxx11i of the Miscellaneous Collections.” This last forms in
all an octavo volume of 910 pages, with several wood-cuts and one plate portrait.

SMITHSONIAN ANNUAL REPORT.

654. ‘‘Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,” 1885,
Part 11. This second part, being the report of the United States National Museum
to July, 1885, has at last been received from the Government Printing Office, more
than a year later than the first part of the report for the same period, which related
to the operations of the Smithsonian Institution proper. This long-delayed Part 11
consists of five sections: The first being the ‘‘ Report upon the Condition and Progress
of the U. S. National Museum during the half year ending June 30, 1885,” by G.
Brown Goode, assistant director, and occupying the first 54 pages of the work.
The second, ‘‘ Reports of the Curators and Acting Curators of the Museum upon the
Progress of their Work” during the period, occupying pages 55 to 146, The third,
a “ Bibliography of the Museum” during the period, including the publications of
the Museum and those of its officers and others relative to the museum material, and
occupying pages 149 to 173. The fourth, a ‘“ List of Accessions to the Museum” dur-
ing the period, together with descriptive notes and indices, occupying pages 175 to
243. The fifth, an appendix, consisting of a very full description of the ‘‘George
Catlin Indian Gallery in the Museum, with memoir and statistics,” by Thomas Don-
aldson, occupying 939 pages, illustrated by 142 plates and maps. This historical
sketch (forming the greater portion of the volume) has proved to be in great popular
demand, the applications made for it through Members of Congress having been un-
usually numerous, so that our stock of 7,000 copies is already nearly exhausted. The
whole number of pages of this Part 1 of the report, including introductory matter
and indices, is 1,220. If to this be added the illustrations, the aggregate would be
equal to 1,500 octavo pages.

657. ‘‘ Report of Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
for the year 1886~87.” his last report of my lamented predecessor forms an
octavo pamphlet of 27 pages. The volume to contain the above report, with its ac-
companying papers and general appendix, has not yet been set up at the Govern-
ment Printing Office. :

ISSUES OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

655. ‘‘ Proceedings of the United States National Museum, Vol. rx, 1886.” As
already stated, this series, though primarily published at the expense of the Govern-
ment by the authority of the Interior Department, has heretofore been re-issued by
the Smithsonian Institution. The present volume, completed and collected during
the past year, consists of descriptive papers by James E. Benedict, T. W. Blackiston,
George H. Boehmer, Charles H. Bollman, E. D. Cope, W. H. Dall, George E. Doering,
Charles L. Edwards, Carl H. Eigenmann, Barton W. Evermann, Fernando Ferari-
Perez, Morton W. Fordyce, Elizabeth G. Hughes, David S. Jordan, George N. Law-
rence, John Belknap Marcon, William G. Masyk, George P. Merrill, Richard Rathbun,
Robert Ridgway, John A. Rider, John B. Smith, Rosa Smith, Leonard Steineger,
Frederick W. True, and John Grant Wells. The collection forms an octavo volume
of 720 pages, including introduction and index, and is illustrated by 25 plates, of
which one is a chromo-lithograph.

565. ‘Bulletin of the United States National Museum, No. 32.” This work is a
Catalogue of Batrachians and Reptiles of Central America and Mexico, by E. D. Cope.
The systematic catalogue is very largely based on the specimens contained in the
National Museum. To each species is added a list of the localities at which it has
been discovered, together with the name of the discoverer, or, in the absence of that,
with the name of the author who is responsible for the correctness of the locality.
The total number of genera included in the catalogue is 197, and of species 705, of
which 135 are Batrachians and 570 Reptilians. The Bulletin forms a pamphlet of 98
octavo pages.

STEREOTYPE PLATES ON HAND.

For many years the greater portion of the stereotype plates of Smithsonian pub-

lications has been stored in Philadelphia, in the fire-proof vaults of the Academy of
102 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Natural Sciences, generously offered for that purpose. There having been no safe
depository here for them, and much of the printing having been done in Philadelphia,
the plates have been allowed to remain there undisturbed.

As the institution now has suitable store-rooms entirely fire-proof, and it is found
that new editions of works can be printed to better advantage in this city, thereby
avoiding the cost of transportation of the whole editions of publications, it is pro-
posed to bring all these plates together in one depository—the basement of the
Smithsonian Building. A

It is to be regretted that the early volumes of ‘‘Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge” were not stereotyped, and thus that it is impossible at the present time
to reproduce full sets.

The plates of the annual reports from 1862 to 1886 (twenty-five years) are in pos-
session of the Institution; and if supplies should be wanted for libraries or individ-
uals, an edition might at any time be ordered by Congress, at the mere cost of paper
and press-work.
APPENDIX III.

REPORT UPON INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1888.

By J. H. Kipper, Curator.

The business of the exchange office has increased during the year, as shown by the
following table:

| |
1886-’87. | 1887-’88. | Increase.

or over 40 per cent. more packages were handled than during the previous year. This
large increase is partly offset by the fact that an unusually large number of the pack-
ages received during the year just passed were single publications and of small size.
The business of the office is set forth in detail by Exhibit A, hereto appended.

EXPENSE.

The expense of the service for the fiscal year has been $15,113.75, of which sum
$12,000 were voted by Congress for the support of the ‘international exchanges
with foreign countries,” and $205.75 were refunded by the Patent Office, Signal Of-
fice, and a correspondent in South America, leaving a net deficit of $2,908, which has
been paid from the Smithsonian fund.

The expenditure for the fiscal year 1888~89 at the present rate, making no allow-
ance for increase in the business of the office or in the pay of its employés, will be
$16,050. If the amount estimated for Jast October, $15,000, shall be voted by Con-
gress, there will be a deficit at the end of the year of at least $1,050, to be paid by
the Smithsonian fund. Considering the probability that the business of the office
will continue to increase during the next fiscal year, I think it reasonable to expect
that the deficit will amount to as much as $2,000 by the 30th of June, 1889.

RE-IMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.

In former years a part of the deficit in the expense of transportation has been re-
paid to the Smithsonian Institution by the different departments and bureaus of the
Government, to which occasional appropriations have been granted by Congress for
the purpose. During the past year such payments have been made by the Signal
Office and Patent Office, but only of a part of their indebtedness, the usnal appro-
priations to other bureaus having been omitted. The Institution has, therefore, de-
sisted from sending bills during the year to offices of the National Government, bal-

By the terms of the pending sundry civil bill for the year ending June 30, 1889,
the Geological Survey will have an appropriation of $5,000 ‘‘ for the purchase of neces-
sary books for the library, and the payment for the transmission of public documents
through the Smithsonian exchange.” Other appropriations of a similar purport are to
the Signal Office ‘‘for exnenses * * * of prepaying, printing, distributing, and
displaying weather maps, etc., $15,000,” and to the War Department ‘for the trans-
portation of charts and maps to foreign countries through the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, $100.” By the legislative and executive bill it is proposed to appropriate to the
Naval Observatory ‘‘for payment to the Smithsonian Institution for freight on Ob-
servatory publications sent to foreign countries, $136,” and to the Library of Con-
gress ‘‘for expenses of exchanging public documents for the publications of foreign
governments, $1,500.” By the same act an indefinite part of an appropriation of $3,000
to the Patent Office is ‘‘ for the purchase of books and expenses of transporting pub-
lications of patents issued by the Patent Office to foreign governments,” and a simi-
lar appropriation of $2,000 to the Bureau of Edueation is ‘for the distribution and
exchange of educational documents,” among other purposes.

It appears then to have been the intention of Congress that its specific appropria-
tion for the exchange business shall be supplemented by special appropriations to
some of the bureaus and departments of the Government, so that the charge of 5 cents
per pound weight, imposed by the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution in 1878,
may be met by them.

It is my opinion, and I therefore respectfully recommend, that this procedure,
which had become necessary at the time of its original adoption by reason of the
heavy annual expense of the exchanges to the Smithsonian fund, is no longer ad-
vantageous or economical and may wisely be discontinued. The average annual
amount collected in this way between the years 1878 and 1887 was about $1,650. Al-
lowing for the increased business of later years $2,000 should be added to the annual
appropriation for Exchanges. The expense to the Government would be no greater
than it now is, while the entire cost of the Exchanges would appear in a single ap-
propriation. By the present system the cost of the service is actualiy larger than ap-
pears in the specific appropriation for Exchanges, and as the special appropriations to
the different departments of the Government vary from year to year, and are often
omitted altogether, an uncertain burden, which can not be accurately foreseen, is
imposed upon the Smithsonian fund.

CORRESPONDENTS.

The number of correspondents has been increased during the year by 1,721 new
names. There have been 100 losses by deaths 6f individuals or discontinuance of
organizations.

The additions are classified as follows:

GRAND DUCHY OF BADEN.

The Grand Duchy of Baden was one of the governments which were the first to
accede to the proposition for international exchanges conveyed by Professor Henry’s
circular letter dated May 16, 1867, and two cases were shipped to Karlsruhe through
the Smithsonian agent at Leipzig,on tbe i3th of June, 1873. After that time ex-
changes with Baden were discontinued until the visit of Mr. George H. Boehmer,
special agent of the Exchange Office and of the National Library, to Kurope in 1884.
Mr. Boehmer succeeded in procuring from the Government of the Grand Duchy a set
of the statutes (Official Gazette) from 1803 to 1885, and the proceedings of the Diet
since 1849. Continuations of these series were shipped by the Government of Baden in
August, 1887, and in February, 1888, Baden was again added to the list of governments
receiving official international exchanges. ‘Twenty-four boxes were sent thither on
the 29th of February, 1888, and three shipments have been made since that time.

The number of Governments now taking part with the United States in these of-
ficial exchanges is 41, as follows:

Argentine Republic, Engtand, Prussia,
Austria, Greece, Queensland,
Baden, Hayti, Russia,
Bavaria, Holland, Saxony,
Belgium, Hungary, South Australia,
Buenos Ayres, India, Spain,
Brazil, Italy, Sweden,
Canada (Ottawa), Japan, Switzerland,
Canada (Toronto), Mexico, Tasmania,
Chili, - New South Wales, Turkey,
Colombia, United States of, | New Zealand, Venezuela,
Denmark, Norway, Victoria,
France, Peru, Wurtemberg.
North German Empire, Portugal,

It will be observed that several of these Governments are provincial or subordinate
members of an empire, kingdom, or republic.

Of this number only seven, to wit, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Servia, Spain,
and Switzerland, have acceded to the first of the two conventions, based upon a con-
ference of representatives of different Governments at Brussels in 1886, and now pend-
ing before the Senate of the United States. *

The first of the two conventions relates te the ‘‘ International Exchange of official
documents and scientific publications; ” the second, to the ‘immediate exchange of
the daily official journals” of legislative assemblies.

To this second convention only six nations besides the United States have acceded,
Switzerland withdrawing.

These conventions have been brought about mainly through the active interest of
the Government of Belgium in the success and extension of the international exchange
system. The history of the present agreements is of some interest in this connection,
aud has been set forth at length by Mr. George H. Boehmer in prev ious reports (see

106 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

especially Secretary’s Reports for 1881, 1883, and 1887). It may be briefly summarized,
as follows:

The delegates to the International Geographic Congress, which met at Paris in 1875,
who were for the most part the dipiomatic representatives of the Governments par-
ticipating, passed a unanimous resolution, on the 12th of August, pledging themselves
to request their Governments each to establish a bureau of International Exchanges;
and on the 29th of January, 1876, those delegates who remained in Paris prepared
and signed a set of rules for the management of the exchange business. At this time
the ‘Bureau des Echanges” was established in Paris, under the direction of the_
Baron de Vatteville, and the rules agreed upon by the delegates and issued by this
bureau were generally accepted by the Governments concerned, but no ratifications
or other formal and international agreements were exchanged. England and Ger-
many refused from the first to participate in either conferences or conventions relat-
ing to international exchanges.

With the hope of bringing about a more formal agreement, which should have the
force and obligation of a treaty, the Government of Belgium called another conference,
which met at Brussels in 1850, but at which the United States was not represented.
This conference prepared an amended agreement for future consideration.

In the year 1883 (April 10) there was another, more formal, conference at Brussels,
at which this country was represented by Mr. Nicholas Fish, the United States min-
ister resident. By this conference the articles prepared by the meeting of 1580 were
revised and further amended. At the instance of France the exchange bureaus were
relieved from the duty of collecting official publications from the several depart-
mental offices for transmission. The articles, as amended, were agreed to by the rep-
resentative of the United States. A second special agreement was also drawn up,
providing for the immediate transmission of parliamentary journals, annals, and pub-
lic documents, which the representative of the United States refused to sign. A
protocol, signed by all the powers represented, stated the purpose of the proposed
conventions to be (1) the collection into a national library of each country of all
official publications of every other; and (2) as many literary, scientific, and art
publications as the bureaus could procure.

The articles agreed upon in 1883 were signed at a third Brussels conference in 1886,
and on this occasion the representative of the United States, Mr. Lambert Tree, the
minister resident, signed the additional convention providing for the immediate
transmission of parliamentary daily journals, ete., which his predecessor had rejected
in 1883. At this time France declined to participate further in the conferences, Eng-
land and Germany still persisting in their refusal. As already stated, only seven
Governments besides the United States have acceded to the general convention for
international exchanges, and only six to the special agreement for the immediate
exchange of the daily journals of legislative assemblies. With the thirty-four other
Governments which take part in the international official exchanges this friendly
commerce will probably continue in the future as it has in the past, upon the basis of
mutual agreements between the parties concerned, but without the sanction or com-
pulsion of treaty obligations. ;

The principal advantage accruing from these several conferences and conventions
has been the establishment of a certain uniformity of procedure in the transactions
of the exchange business by the agents of the countries interested.

The conventions themselves do not promise any definite improvement in the present
system, from the point of view held by the Smithsonian Institution, the main stipu-
lations for which it has contended not having been retained in the agreements now
under consideration. These are, as stated by Professor Henry (circular letter dated
May 16, 1867), and by Professor Baird (letter to Baron de Vatteville, dated February
8, 1579), that each exchange agency shall, (1) furnish an annual list of all the offi-
cial publications of its Government, and (2) shall charge itself with the collection and
forwarding of such publications. These provisions appeared in the agreement of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 107

1875, the authorship of which is attributed principally to the representatives of
France; were stricken out of the amended articles considered in 1883 at the in-
stance of France; and in 1886 that Government declined to take further part in the
conference.

It is, in fact, scarcely possible for the exchange offices of most foreign countries to
procure all of the official publications of their Governments for exchange purposes,
the publishing arrangements of the governmental departments being for the most
part quite separate and distinct from one another, and there being no law, except in
the United States and Belgium, requiring them to furnish copies for this purpose. It
is indeed extremely difficult even for the exchange agent of a Goverment to ascer-
tain what the official publications of the different departments and bureaus are.

The text of the two conventions as finally agreed to by the conference of 1886 is
presented herewith as Exhibit B.

During the past year some unusual pains have been taken in the efforts to increase
the number of official publications received from foreign countries, it appearing that
the United States Government now sends out about twenty times as many packages
to other Governments as it receives from them, and that this disproportion has been
annually on the increase for several years past. (See Exhibit C.) With some diffi-
culty and at the cost of much correspondence a list, still not complete, of French
official publications has been compiled, containing four hundred and twenty-one titles.
Of these the library of the Smithsonian Institution received during the calendar
year 1887 thirty-nine titles and the National Library forty-one titles.

During the fiscal year 1887~’88 three shipments were received from the French Bu-
reau des Echanges, on the 6th of June and the 8th of December, 1887, and the 12th of
April, 1888, containing nine official packages for the Library of Congress. The num-
ber of titles contained in these nine packages can not now be precisely stated, but
was probably not greater than that received during the calendar year.

On the other hand, there were four shipments of official publications to France
from this country during the fiscal year, containing seven hundred and sixty-three
packages of official publications.

What has just been said relates only to the international exchange of official publica-
tions, intended for the national libraries of the Governments participating. By far
the larger part of all of the business of this office is actually governmental business,
a considerable proportion of the so-called ‘‘ literary and scientific ” exchanges being
really an exchange of official publications between the bureaus or official subdivis-
ions of the different Governments, for the benetit of the bureau libraries, and not for
that of central or national libraries, as contemplated by the international agreements
already referred to (Exhibit B). *

Most of the foreign Government bureaus, and of our own as well, desire to enrich
their individual libraries, and do not regard the deposit of one set of the publications

*These publications are as strictly a part of the “official or governmental ” ex-
changes as are those provided for by the resolution of Congress granting fifty copies for
foreign national libraries. While, therefore, long usage has sanctioned the designations
“literary and scientific” and ‘ official,” in the sense explained above, I think that in
the interest of convenience and intelligibility, hereafter if will be better to express
simply the distinction which really exists, namely, that between the official and un-
official exchanges, by the adjections ‘“ governmental” and ‘‘ miscellaneous ;”” meaning
by the former all publications sent or received by the Government or its bureans, and
by the latter all others. The publications of the Smithsonian Institution, which
are partly “ governmental” and partly ‘‘ miscellaneous,” although divided so far as
the exchange records and statistics are concerned, are accounted for as a whole by
the office routine of the Institution. Iam not aware of any other oflice or organiza-
tion whose publications would not fall wholly within one or the other of these
classes.
108 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
of other countries in the national library as an equivalent for some forty copies of their
own publications.

If the clauses proposed by the Paris conference of 1875, and always urged by the
Smithsonian Institution, requiring the preparation and exchange of annual lists of
all official publications, and that all of those named in the lists should be furnished
to each of the contracting parties, had been retained in the convention of 1886, and if
the convention could be faithfully executed, an effective remedy for the shortcomings
already indicated might have been found. The opposition of some of the Governments
participating in the conferences however (notably France and Switzerland), and
the final withdrawal of France and continued indifference of England and Germany,
have made this remedy impossible. Something has been done during the past year,
by perservering correspondence, and more may doubtless be effected hereafter in the
same way, but the most promising plan yet tried has been the employment of a
special agent to visit the European (as the most important) Government offices, and
excite there an interest in the subject by personal explanation and argument. Mr.
George H. Boehmer, of this office, was employed in this way in 1884, as has been already
stated, with the result of mnch larger receipts than have been shown by any one
year before or since. After Mr. Boehmer’s return, however, the temporary interest
which his mission had excited rapidly weakened. Many sets of publications which
had been freely promised him (notably a complete set of the publications of the
British Government) have not been sent, mainly because of indifference, and of the
considerable labor and time required for preparing the sets for shipment.

It is not only foreign Governments, however, which show shortcomings in this
matter. According to Hickox’ monthly catalogue of Government publications, there
were issued by the National Government and its bureaus, during the first six months
of the year 1888, about eleven hundred separate titles, not considering single laws
or articles forming parts of reports as distinct publications. While it is not possi-
ble until the volumes of Executive Documents, Miscellaneous Documents, and Re-
ports have been finally collected and bound, to state precisely the number of sepa-
rate volumes as finally distributed, it is safe to say that the total number for the six
months was greatly in excess of the number of titles furnished for official exchanges.
Of all the Executive Departments, for example, only the Light-House Board and the
Signal Office furnished a part of their publications for this purpose.

The total number of separate titles furnished by the Public Printer during the six
months for which this comparison is drawn was two hundred and ninety-five, includ-
ing a considerable number of Army orders, reports of contested-election cases, and
other matter not of a kind most valuable to foreign Jibraries. Such a comparison as
this can, however, only be regarded as illustrative, since the publications furnished
by the Public Printer are always at least a year old at the time of distribution.

The resolution of Congress, passed July 25, 1868, directing that fifty copies of every
Government publication and every publication issued under the direction of the Gov-
ernment, shall be placed at the disposal of the joint committee of Congress on the Li-
brary for the purpose of the international exchanges, is sufficiently mandatory in its
provisions, but, as above stated, has never been fully carried out. Eftorts have been
made from time to time by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and the Libra-
rian of Congress, with the assistance and support of the State Department and of mem-
bers of both branches of Congress, which have beep set forth at length in the reports
on exchanges attached to the Secretary’s reports for 1886 and 1887. Iam pleased to
be able to report that the receipts from the Public Printer during the last six months
of the year, far as they fall short of the full and complete distribution contemplated
by the law, show a decided increase over the number of titles received and shipped
in previous months and years. The resolution is recited in Exhibit D, hereto ap-
pended.

As I have already said, it is not easy to get data for complete lists of the official
publications of foreign countries, since they have not, tomy knowledge, been brought
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 109

together in a single catalogue by any government. Such lists are now in course of
preparation by this office, and in April last a special card catalogue was begun of the
titles of all foreign official publications which passed through the exchange office, so
that by the end of another year it will be possible to state with some certainty which
official publications each government gives to the international exchanges and which
it withholds.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

Upon assuming general control of the office (March 19, 1888), I found that complaints
and criticisms of the efficiency of the exchange system by individuals, societies, and
Government bureaus were not infrequent. In some instances packages from abroad,
notification of the shipment of which had been long ago received, had not been de-
livered ; in others, packages sent hence had failed to reach their destination or had
been unreasonably delayed. Every such complaint has been promptly and diligently
followed up by correspondence, with the result, in all but three instances thus far,
of tracing the missing package and explaining the delay. It has happened, rather
surprisingly often, that the receipt of the complaining correspondent for the package
he writes of is on file in this office, having been signed by some assistant in his ab-
sence, or by himself and forgotten. In the three cases not yet settled no reply has
yet been received from the distributing agencies to which inquiries have been ad-
dressed.

The fact remains, however, that there have been and are still too many and too great
delays in the transmission of exchange matter from its place of shipment to its des-
tination, and for this state of things there are several reasons.

In the first place, delays occur in this office in forwarding packages addressed to
countries which receive and send but few publications (such as Hawaii, Hayti, and
many of the Central American republics), until a sufficient nnmber has accumulated
to fill one of the ordinary boxes. If these packages should be forwarded as soon as
they are received the expense would be greater than the resources of the exchange
service could bear. But the most serious delays occur in the exchange bureaus of
other countries. For example, in a recent experimental shipment to London, Leip-
zig, and Paris, the boxes having been shipped on the same day and accompanied by
letters asking for immediate acknowledgments, the agents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution at London and Leipzig reported receipt in fourteen and fifteen days, respect-
ively, and the Bureau des Echanges at Paris in forty days. Consignments frequently
remain in the hands of foreign agencies for several months before being forwarded,
while their consignees, having received prompt notice of their shipment from the con-
signor, very naturally regard such delays as unreasonable and unnecessary. Delays
of this sort are, of course, quite beyond the control of the Smithsonian Institution,
which can do nothing to remedy them otherwise than by correspondence and per-
suasion. Every such case is followed up as soon as brought to the notice of the of-
fice, and I fancy that I can already perceive some improvement in the promptness of
shipment and some increased interest in the subject on the part of foreign corre-
spondents.

Another occasional cause of delay arises from the fact that the Smithsonian Institu-
tion continues to be indebted to the generosity and public spirit of most of the ocean
steam-ship lines for free transportation of its exchange boxes, as it has been for many
years past. The list of transportation companies and business firms which continue
to extend this valuable privilege has undergone no change since its publication in
the report for 188687, and isreproduced as Exhibit E, hereto annexed. It naturally
and necessarily follows from this relation between the exchange service and the
transportation companies that boxes bearing the Smithsonian mark are shipped, for
the most part, by slow freight, and are subject to delays at times when paid freight
is offered in excess of the capacity of the steamers. Under special circumstances the
110 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

delay may become considerable, as, for instance, in the case of steamers from Naples,
which have been hard pressed for space on account of the use of some of them as
transports in the military operations of the Italian Government in Africa last year,
when boxes shipped by the exchange office at Rome on December 1, 1887, were re-
ceived in Washington on the 9th of April, 1888, having been detained meanwhile at
Naples in the warehouses of the steam-ship company. At this writing boxes the
shipment of which from Rome was announced more than four months ago have not
yet been received. Delays of this sort are also beyond the control of the Smithson-
ian Institution, and will be likely to recur so long as the Institution continues to be
unable to pay for its freight in the same way as other shippers.

With a view to doing away with this last-named cause of delay and to establishing
the transportation service of the international exchanges upon an assured business
basis an estimate of the probable annual cost of the service was drawn up last May,
based upon the usual ocean steam-ship charges and the average amount of freight
which may be expected to be forwarded yearly to each country. The sum estimated
was $27,050, which you presented to Congress as an amended estimate, through the
honorable Secretary of the Treasury, on the 31st of May last, but which has not yet
been acted upon.

So far as my own observations extend, and, as I have every reason to believe, for a
considerable time previous to my appointment, no avoidable delay has occurred
either in the Smithsonian exchange bureau or in the offices ofits paid agents at Lon-
don and Leipzig. The quantity and frequency of shipments to and receipts from the
different countries concerned in the international exchanges are set forth as Exhibit
F, presented herewith.

But few changes in the routine have been made during the year. Since last March
a printed card has been placed in each outgoing package, stating the date of its
shipment from the Smithsonian Institution, and requesting that any unusual delay
in its receipt be promptly reported. On the Ist of June the shipping office was sep-
arated from the receiving office with the result of a considerable economy of time and
labor. Two circulars have been issued during the year; one on March 2, requesting
the bureaus of the National Government to correct and complete their list of publi-
cations prepared in response to a circular issued in the previous year, and described
in the annual report upon international exchanges for the year ending June 30, 1887 ;
the other on May 31, requesting an expression of opinion from all the bureaus and
offices of the National Government, as to the advantage to their business of increased
speed in transmitting their publications. Both circulars were very generally answered
and have been the means of procuring valuable information for use in the future.

I take pleasure in being able to bear witness to the faithfulness and efficiency of
the employés in the exchange office. Although the greater part of them receive a
less compensation than employés in other offices of the Government, and the duties
which they perform are both laborious and responsible, the business of the office has
not at any time been in arrears, nor has any employé incurred censure for misconduct
or neglect. ‘The foreign agencies of the exchange service, conducted by Messrs. Will-
iam Wesley & Son at London and by Dr. Felix Fliigel at Leipzig, are also in every
way satisfactory as regards promptness and efficiency.

CIRCULARS RESPECTING PERIODICALS.
CIRCULAR TO THE CURATORS OF THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Marcu 19, 1887.

DEAR SiR: It is my desire to obtain from you (1) a list of those periodicals, whether
transactions of societies or otherwise, which you deem most nearly indispensable to
your own department. This inquiry is irrespective of the fact that the Museum does
already possess them or not, and the list should be confined to the most essentially
necessary titles; if possible, not over twenty in number.

I may add, to make my meaning plainer, that standard transactions of well-known
societies concerned in all branches of science, such as the Royal Society of London,
the Comptes Rendus de l'Institut of Paris, ete., and well known periodicals admitting
the discussion of all scientific topics; such as Science, the American Journal of
Science, Nature, etc., are excluded from such a list, which is meant to cover only
those technical periodicals of most special use to your own department.

In addition to this list, and quite distinct from it, I should be pleased to nave you
give.a list (2) of recent serials, whether transactions or otherwise, of interest in con-
section with your special investigations, even if not exclusively devoted tothem. To
be more definite, let us say anything of real importance or even considerable promise
commenced within the past twelve years. There need be no limit to the number of
titles in this list, but the more important one should have a distinctive check; and I
should be very glad if it might suit your convenience to let me have it in this week
or next.

While the above two lists are especially important and are desired at your earliest
convenience, I should be pleased to have you supply me in addition with a list of
every serial publication which a worker in your field may expect to have not wholly
infrequent occasion to consult; and bere again I should be glad to have you indicate

those of most value.
S. P. LANGLEY,

Assistant Secretary.

GENERAL CIRCULAR,

JUNE 15, 1887.

Dear Sir: The Smithsonian Institution, in pursuit of the object of its foundation,
the “‘increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” has always aimed to keep a
complete list of all transactions and proceedings of learned societies and of all jour-
nals devoted to science and the nseful arts throughout the world, This, at least, is
the aim; but it must often fall short of the fulfillment of so large a purpose and from
time to time find its lists need revising, and this in two different particulars. First,
in adding to its lists new societies or new periodicals which have arisen since the
last revisal; second, in repairing lacune in 1ts sets of long established society trans-
actions or technical journals, and for this end it needs to know which still maintains
a prominent place, so that gaps in the more important ones shall receive first atten-
tion.

It has been suggested to me that you are able, and may perhaps be willing, to
assist us by supplying under these two heads the names of those special transactions

117
118 : REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

or journals which you would like to see made accessible to every student of the sub-
ject of —--- , with which your own name is here associated.

The subject of is, of course, divisible into others, such as
,and we address ourselves to you in the hope that you can oblige us with the
names of any meritorious publications, whether foreign or domestic, devoted either
to — in general, or to any such of its subdivisions.

To make our wants entirely clear, let me explain that the Institution does not or-
dinarily need to be informed of the names of societies or journals dealing with all
departments of knowledge, but only of such transactions of societies and the names
of such journals as are concerned chiefly, if not wholly, with the subject in ques-
tion, or which, at any rate, are frequently consulted by itsspecial students.

It is chiefly for such technical publications that we desire lists under the two
heads already named. To repeat: First, of those transactions of societies or periodi-
cals devoted to the principal subject in question, or to some of its branches which
have been established within the past twelve or fifteen years and which you know
to be frequently consulted; second, of those which, being long established, are of
now most generally recognized importance.

I venture to address to you this: outlined plan without having any claim upon
your kindness other than this, that the single purpose of this request is to make the
Smithsonian Library more immediately useful to every student in your own depart-
ment, and that nothing can contribute more directly to this end than your furnish-
ing the desired list, with which, if you can oblige me, I beg we may be favored
within the coming month.

In case you do not feel that your time will allow you to make it complete, I beg
you will not, on this account, refuse your help altogether, but rather that you will
put down, if only imperfectly, the transactions or journals best known to you and
which seem most desirable in connection with the general subject or with any of its
divisions as indicated.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Acting Secretary.

APPENDIX V.

ORGANIZATION OF LIBRARY.

1. By act of Congress of April 5, 1866, the Library of the Smithsonian Institution
is to be kept with the Library of Congress, but with the provision that the Institu-
tion shall continue to enjoy its customary use of it. The following regulations refer
only to those books which, under the above proviso, are retained at the Smithsonian
Institution proper, or in its Museum Library.

2. By order of the Secretary, after April 1, 1887, these are under the general direc-
tion of the Assistant Secretary, in charge of the library placed in the immediate charge
of a librarian, whose title shall be Librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, and
whose duty it shall be to decide what books shall be retained from the Library of
Congress in acentral library under his charge. The following regulations are in-
tended for the better execution of the aforesaid order.

SECTIONAL LIBRARIES.

3. Sectional libraries may be formed by the officers of the Smithscnian Institution,
namely, the assistant secretaries and the chief clerk, and also by the curators and
acting curators and the editor. Curators and acting curators are permitted, subject
to the approval of the assistant secretary in charge of the Museum, to form sectional
libraries to be kept in their respective offices, but this shall only be done by with-
drawing from the general collection such books as relate exclusively to the objects
under their care. Dictionaries, cyclopwdias, journals, or any works other than such
as relate exclusively to the special department can not form a part f such a sec-
tional library, except upon the recommendation of the librarian, approved by one of
the assistant secretaries.

4. The official in charge of each sectional library shall be responsible for its safe
keeping, and shall on no account lend the books.

5. Books in the sectional library must be returned to the central library before
they can be issued for use outside of the office or room to which they are accredited.

6. The books of each sectional library shall be kept separate from all other books
in the rooms of the official or curator, in distinet cases, the locks of which shall be
controlled by a master key in the hands of the librarian, who may, at stated times,
examine them, and call the attention of the curators to any deficiencies.

7. No person who is not a member of the scientific staff of the Museum shall with-
draw books or other matter without special written permission from one of the offi-
cers of the Smithsonian Institution. Persons taking books from the central library
shall be responsible for the safe keeping of the same, and shall make good any losses,
They shall not be allowed to withdraw other books until those which are lost have
been restored.

8. The librarian shall have authority to decide what books are suitable for any
curator’s sectional library, and to recall any book not in a sectional library within
two weeks. Permanent recalls of books from sectional libraries may be made, as
well as temporary calls. In case of certain rare or costly or encyclopedic works, or
in other special instances, the librarian shall be authorized to designate books
which shall in no case be taken from the library. This regulation shall not apply to

119
120 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

any books now actually in the office of the editor. All books and other matter not
in the sectional library shall be at all times subject to recall by the librarian.

% The librarian will be expected to exercise his discretion as to the books to be
withdrawn from the Congressional Library, but will (in the absence of special cause
to the contrary) recall any book upon receiving a written request for the same.

10. The librarian shall annually, or oftener, report to the Assistant Secretary, in
charge of the library, any defective series, any missing books, or any new serials, or
books which are specially desirable.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING ENTRY AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BOOKS.

11. All books, pamphlets, periodicals, maps, and other publications acquired by
the Smithsonian Institution through exchange or donation or purchase shall be
separately entered by the librarian, who shall prepare a reference list, with the aid
of which he shall immediately upon their receipt from the chief clerk divide them
into two classes, one of which is to be fully entered within a day of its receipt; the
other to be fully entered in any case at some time within the current week.

12. It shall be an invariable rule that such a full entry, to consist of both a day-
book and a ledger-account entry, shall be made within the above-specified time for
every separate book, or pamphlet or map, without exception; but it is understood
that this ledger account may be in the form of a card catalogue.

13. Against every title there shall be entered in the day-book the letter ‘ C”
(Smithsonian Library, deposited in Library of Congress), or ““G” (Smithsonian Li-
brary, deposited with Surgeon General), or ‘‘1” (Smithsonian Library, deposited at the
Institution) ; and it shall be the duty of the librarian to see that all books of the first
class are prepared for delivery to the Librarian of Congress within the current week.

14. The librarian shall notify the exchange department within the current week of
any new correspondent on his books, and shall also acknowledge receipt to the senders
or donors of every article at stated times, at intervals of not more than a year, and
shall make a record of such entry, with the date of acknowledgment opposite to the
entry of the work in question.

15. It shall be the duty of the librarian at all times to hold these books open to the
inspection of the Librarian of Congress, and to report to him the place and condition
of any work under his charge in answer to any specific inquiry.

16. In addition to the books which are included in ihe Smithsonian deposit in the
Library of Congress, and so stamped, there are certain books procured by the Smith-
sonian Institution for use in the National Museum. These shal? be distinctively
marked ; and it is understood that while they form no part of the above-described
books of the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress, they are in other re-
spects to be treated in accordance with the above regulations. No book or chart
belonging to the Smithsonian Institution is exempt from them unless procured for
the specific use of an officer of the Smithsonian, as above designated, and distinctively
stamped as belonging to his office.

The above rules will take effect on and after this date.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Assistant Secretary, in charge of Library.

Notr (added December 3, 1887).—Under the last clause come books purchased es-
pecially for the office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or chief clerk, forming
“‘oftice libraries,” and for these it is uuderstood that the librarian’s responsibility
ceases when he has distinctively stamped each, entered it distinctively on the card
catalogue, and also in a separate list catalogue. Indispensable books of reference in
exchange department, etc., form part of chief clerk’s office library.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19t

Nore (added February 13, 1888).—This last clause above cited is to be understood
as including the books purchased at the expense of the Museum appropriation, but
not necessarily books obtained by exchange for Museum publications, as it would
be difficult, if not impossible, always to discriminate these under our present system.
This point is reserved for future consideration, but provisionally it is understood that
the librarian is to send books to the Library of Congress if not evidently meant for
the Museum.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish summaries of scientific discovery
in particular directions; occasional reports of the investigations made
by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a general character or
on special topics, whether original and prepared expressly for the pur-
pose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and briefly to
present (as fully as space will permit) such papers not published in the
“Smithsonian Contributions” or in the “ Miscellaneous Collections ” as
may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

ASTRONOMY FOR 1887, 1888.

By WILLIAM C. WINLOCK.

The following record of the progress of Astronomy during the years
1887 and 1888 is presented in essentially the form adopted by Professor
Holden in 1879. It is thought that this form is most suitable for an
annual record, as it furnishes a series of reference notes for those espe-
cially interested in the study of astronomy, and at the same time a con-
densed review for the general reader.

The writer has made free use of reviews and abstracts which have
appeared in the Bulletin Astronomique, the Observatory, Nature, the
Atheneum, and other periodicals.

COSMOGONY.

Dr. Carl Braun, S. J., formerly director of the Kalocsa Observatory,
has collected in a book of 167 pages a series of essays, first published
in the Catholic periodical Natur und Offenbarung in 1885-’86, in which
he enters into a scientific discussion of the evolution of the universe,
more particularly the formation of the sun and planets. His theory
demands a structureless, motionless, tenuous nebula, its particles en-
dowed with gravity and atomic repulsion. Such a nebula, if perfectly
homogeneous, should give birth to one portentous solitary sun. But,
in point of fact, it would possess innumerable, almost imperceptible,
local irregularities, which, forming so many centers of attraction, would
eventually lead to the breaking up of the nebula into a vast multitude
of separate fragments. On one of these, the destined progenitor of the
solar system, we are asked to concentrate our attention. The manner
of its development is, however, a widely different one from that traced
by Laplace, who assumed the needful rotation and left the rest to work
itself out spontaneously. Dr. Braun, on the other hand, assumes less
to begin with, but invokes adventitious aid in emergencies. He ascribes
the rotation of the original solar nebula to the impact of masses drawn
in from the depths of space, comet-like projectiles, endowed with energy
external to the system. These mdsses would affect the outer shell con-

125
126 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

stituting the nebula more than they would the inner, and the result is
a central condensation surrounded by an ellipsoidal atmosphere revolv-
ing with increasing velocity as we proceed outwards from the center.
Instead of supposing that the planets are formed from rings detached
from this nebula by over spinning, Braun assumes that their formation
is determined simply by centers of condensation which existed in the
nebula itself. These formations have commenced at distances from the
central nucleus much greater than the present distances of the planets,
and the immediate result is an approach to the sun within a distance
at which its attraction is balanced by the outward gaseous pressure and
the centrifugal force. The incipient planet, animated with the greater
ancular velocity of the stratum to which it originally belonged, revolves
now at a rate slightly superior to that of the new medium in which it
finds itself. Hence the possibility of its sweeping up and annexing
fresh matter as it proceeds along the coils of its narrowing orbit, until
a point is reached when the planet, or even sun, has drawn in all the
matter which stood in its way, and gravity alone exactly balances cen-
trifugal force. The planet then revolves in an orbit sensibly the same
as at present,

As the planet in approaching the sun has encountered strata of in-
creasing density, so that the tangential resistance on the side towards
the sun has always been greater than on the opposite side, it is easy to
see that a planetary or ‘‘ direct” rotation must be set up in the direction
of revolution. In order to explain the rotation of Neptune, which is
probably, like its satellite, retrograde, it is necessary to suppose that
the birth of the planet was preceded by the formation of a ring, while
Uranus is regarded as a “limiting instance” between the annular and
the nuclear methods of generation.

Ingenious explanations are derived for the rapid motion of Phobos,
the inner satellite of Mars, for the swifter rotation of the larger planets,
and for the increase in their density and decrease in their mass as we
approach the sun. Mars is an exception; but there are reasons for
thinking it of later formation, so that when it came into existence the
space allotted for its growth was already greatly exhausted, owing
chiefly to the powerful attraction of Jupiter.

While many of Father Braun’s conclusions will not be accepted by
cosmogonists, his work forms an able contribution to the subject. Its
appearance may be said to mark the definite abandonment by sound
thinkers of the annular method of planet and satellite formation, and
gradually it is becoming clear that ‘‘ while the various members of the
sular family owned unquestionably a common origin, they can scarcely
be said to have had a common history.”

Janssen delivered an interesting discourse bearing upon the same sub-
ject at Paris, October 25, 1887—‘‘ The age of the stars,” in which he
reviewed the steps leading us to the belief that each star must have a
beginning, a period of activity, a decline, and au end; and he points
ASTRONOMY. 127

out that upon the hypothesis that stars of higher temperature will last
longer than stars of lower, we must conclude, from the testimony of the
spectroscope, that Sirius, Vega, and the greater number of the stars
visible to the naked eye are in their youth, while Aldebaran, Arcturus,
and our own sun have long since passed their period of greatest activity.

NEBULA AND STAR-CLUSTERS.

Dr. Dreyer’s new general catalogue of nebulie and clusters of stars is
essentially a new edition of Sir John Herschel’s catalogue, revised, cor-
rected, and brought down to December, 1887. It therefore forms a com-
plete list of all known nebulie, and is of the greatest value to observers.
Herschel’s General Catalogue was published in 1864 and contained 5,079
objects. D’Arrest’s work, published three years later, gave the means
of correctivg many of the errors in the earlier observations, and in 1876
Dr. Dreyer compiled a supplement from the material at that time avail-
able. Recent discoveries have given rise to a demand for a-second sup-
plement which has been wisely met by recasting the whole work. *The
present catalogue contains 7,840 objects, the positions being given in
right ascension to seconds of time and in declination to tenths of a min-
ute of are. The epoch of the first general catalogue and of D’Arrest’s
final positions—1860—has been retained ; precessions are given for 1880.
There is an index to published figures of nebule and clusters, and-an
appendix giving the places of new nebulie published too late to be in-
corporated in the catalogue itself. Further additions in numbers or in
accuracy of positions might, perhaps, now be made from the recently
published lists of Bigourdan, von Engelhardt, Ginzel, Stone, and Swift.

The largest refractor devoted almost exclusively to the observation of
nebulv is the 26-inch equatorial of the Leander McCormick Observatory.
Professor Stone’s object is to obtain as accurate positions as possible
and thus to establish the means of detecting the proper motion of these
objects if any exists. His working list embraces all nebule north of
—30° which are as bright as the fourteenth magnitude.

Dr. Dreyer has submitted to a rigid examination all reported cases
of variability or proper motion in nebule, and concludes that in not
one case can either be considered as well established. It seems that
the only well-authenticated changes are changes of brightness only,
while we so far do not possess any clear evidence of change of form or
change of place.

Detection of new nebule by photography.—Protessor Pickering in order
to test the efficacy of photography in the discovery of new nebulie has
compared the number of nebulz shown in a series of photographs of
the regions about the great nebule in Orion with the number in the
same region given by Dreyer’s catalogue. The instrument employed
was the Bache telescope, which has a photographic doublet with an
aperture of 8 inches and focal length of 44 inches. Each plate covered
a region 10 degrees square, the great nebule being about the center;
128 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

the definition was good in a central cireular area about 7 degrees in
diameter. Fourteen of the objects photographed are contained in
Dreyer’s catalogue; four in the catalogue are not photographed; twelve
that are photographed are not in the catalogue. Professor Pickering
concludes that in earrying out the same proportion we might expect
to discover four or five thousand such objects by photographing the
whole sky; but, he adds, “there is one consideration that may seriously
modify this conclusion. ‘The successive improvements in photography
have continually increased the limits of the nebula in Orion. These
plates show that it not only ineludes the sword-handle, ¢, z, and #, but
a long nebulosity extends south from €, others surround this star, while
others, both north and south, indicate that perhaps the next increase
in sensitiveness of our plates will join them all in a vast nebula many
degrees in length.”

Herr von Gothard has obtained extraordinary results with a 10-inch
reflector. His photographs, though small, show a great richness of de-
tail; several of them are reproduced in an article by Dr. Vogel, in No.
2854 of the Nachrichten. The photographs of clusters Dr. Vogel was
able to enlarge without great difficulty, but for the nebule it was ueces-
sary to resort to drawings; among the latter the reproduction of a
photograph of the spiral nebula in Canes Venatici is particularly inter-
esting.

The Ring Nebula in Lyra.—Professor Holden reports that nearly all
the nebulz examined with the 36 inch Lick telescope show a multitude
of new details of structure. In the Ring Nebula in Lyra, for example,
Lassell’s 4-foot reflector and the Washington 26-inch refractor show
thirteen stars in an oval outside the ring, and only one star within it,
while the Lick glass shows twelve stars within the ring or projected on
it, and renders it obvious that the nebula consists of a series of ovals
or ellipses—first the ring of stars, then the outer and inner edges of the
nebulosity; next a ring of faint stars round the edges of the inner ring,
and last a number of stars situated on the various parts of the nebu-
losity and outer oval.

Mr. Roberts’ photographs of the Ring Nebula in Lyra, the Great
Nebula in Andromeda, and others, also require special mention.

The Great Nebula in Orion.—In the spectrum of this nebula, Dr. Cope-
Jand has observed a new line apparently identical with D;, wave-length
587.4. The occurrence of this line in the spectrum of a nebula is of
great interest as affording another connecting link between gaseous
nebule and the sun and stars with bright-line spectra, especially with
that remarkable class of stars, of which the first examples were de-
tected by Wolf and Rayet in the constellation Cygnus.

The Pleiades.—The initial volume of publications of the Yale Observa-
tory is a valuable memoir by Dr. W. L. Elkin on the positions of the
principal stars in the Pleiades as determined with the new Yale heliom-
eter, and it is, we believe, the first heliometer work done in this coun-
ASTRONOMY, 129

try. Dr. Elkin has taken in all the stars in the Durchmusterung down
to 9.2 magnitude, which may reasonably be said to fall within the group,
and in so doing he has rejected one of the stars used by Bessel in his
celebrated work with the Koénigsberg heliometer as too faint for accu-
rate measurement, but he has added seventeen stars to Bessel’s list of
fifty-three, so that he has taken sixty-nine stars in all. Two practically
independent methods of measurement were adopted. The first plan
was to measure the distance of each star of the group from each one of
four reference stars situated so as to form a quadrilateral symmetrically
placed about the group; the position of each star thus depended on
measures of distance alone. The second plan was to measure the posi-
tion-angle and distance of each star from 7 Tauri or Alcyone, the cen-
tral star of the group. The work on the quadrilateral plan was com-
menced in March, 1884, and lasted to December—the measures from 7
Tauri occupied the first three and last four months of 1885, the mean
epoch of the second triangulation falling about a year later than that
of the first. Dr. Elkin gives a brief description of the instrument with
his method of using it, and this is followed by a determination of the
instrumental constants and by the observations in detail. The defini-
tive results are then critically compared with Bessel’s heliometer work
and with the filar micrometer measures of Wolf at Paris and Pritchard
at Oxford. The comparison with the Kénigsberg observations shows
that for the six largest stars there is a striking community of mo-
tion, both in direction and in amount, and it is remarkable that this
general direction of drift is very similar to the reversed absolute motion
of Aleyone as given by Newcomb. Dr. Elkin thinks the coincidence is
sufficiently close for two of the stars at least, and possibly for the other
four, to warrant the conclusion that they are only optically members of
the group. Of the remaining twenty-six of the thirty-two stars show-
ing some displacement since 1840, the epoch of Bessel’s catalogue, the
distribution of the direction of motion is by no means equable, six stars
only having an easterly motion, while twenty move towards the west,
and here too there seems to be a tendency to community of drift in cer-
tain groups in the same part of the cluster.

‘““The general character of the internal motions of the group appears
to be thus extremely minute. If for the six stars mentioned as with
more or less probability not belonging to the group this proves to be
the case, there are but five stars for which the displacement amounts to
over one second in forty-five years. The bright stars especially seem
to form an almost rigid system, as for only one is there really much evi-
dence of motion, and in this case (star b) the total amount is barely one
second per century. The hopes of obtaining any clew to the internal
mechanism of this cluster seem therefore not likely to be realized in an
immediate future.”

Professor Hall has measured with the 26-inch Washington refractor
the positions of sixty-three small stars in the group relatively to the

brighter stars determined by Bessel and Elkin, thus furnishing further
data for testing in the future any movement that may be going on in
the system.

Since the discovery of the nebula in the Pleiades around the star
Maia, the Henrys have been at work perfecting their apparatus, and
upon repeating their examination of the Pleiades with an exposure of
four hours, and very sensitive plates, they have defined with considera-
ble detail a great mass of cosmic matter covering a large part of the
group. The most interesting detail is a straight nebulous filament 35/
to 40’ long and only 3” to 4” wide projecting from the main mass in an
east and west direction. This filament passes over seven stars, which
it seems to connect like beads on a string; a slight change in direction
takes place where it meets the largest star. The plate contains nearly
twice as many stars as the first plate—about 2,000 down to the eight-
eenth magnitude.

Excellent photographs of the Pleiades have also been taken by Mr:
Roberts near Liverpool with an 18-inch silvered-glass reflector.

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS.

Constant of precession.—Dr. Ludwig Struve has deduced a new value
of the constant of precession and the motion of the solar system in space
from an elaborate comparison of recent Pulkowa catalogues with Brad-
ley’s observations as reduced by Auwers, thus obtaining an interval of
a century—1755.0 to 1855.0—for the determination of proper motions.
These proper motions, computed with O. Struve’s precession constant
(of 1841), were affected by the apparent displacement due to the motion
of the solar system in space and by the error of the assumed precession
constant.

They thus furnished a means of determining these two quantities.
After rejecting seven stars which seem to be exceptionally near us, the
remaining 2,509 are divided into 120 groups, forming 240 equations of
condition to be solved by least squares for the determination of the five
unknowns, the co-ordinates X, Y, Z of the sun’s “goal” (or point in
space towards which the sun is traveling, to adopt the term introduced
by Professor Newton) and the corrections Am and An to Bessel’s con-
stants. The following table shows the resulting value of the luni-solar
precession compared with that of previous caleulators:

At the end of the paper the author treats of the planetary precession
and the secular variation, and gives a list of stars whose proper mo-
tions as found by him differ from those deduced by Auwers from Green-
wich and Berlin observations. The results obtained for the motion of
the solar system are quoted elsewhere in this report.
ASTRONOMY. 151

Constant of aberration.—Herr Kiistner of the Berlin Observatory has
made a determination of the constant of aberration with a 44 inch
broken-back, universal instrument, employing what is commonly known
in this country as Talcott’s method. His resultis a correction of —0/.132
to Struve’s constant of aberration with the small probable error of
+0”.011. A further exhaustive discussion of the observations has led
the author to conclude that the latitude of his instrument in the spring
of 1884 was 0/.20440”.021 greater than in the spring of 1885—im-
portant evidence upon the mooted question of the variability of ter-
restrial latitudes.

Professor Hall has recently reduced a series of observations of @
Lyre made with the prime vertical instrument at the U. S. Naval Ob-
servatory between the years 1862 and 1867. These observations had
been designed to give corrections to the assumed values of the constants
of nutation and aberration, and an absolute determination of the paral-
lax of the star. The series was not continued for a sufficient period for
the first purpose, and a preliminary examination having shown that a
negative parallax would result, the work has been set aside till the
present time. The mean resulting parallax from the 436 observations
is z=—0".079+0".0134, and the constant of aberration = 20/7.4506+
0.0142,

On account of the uncertainty in the parallax, Professor Hall has in-
troduced a parallax of +0/.15, about the mean value indicated by nu-
merous observations of this star, and he then obtains a constant of
aberration =20/.4542+0’.0144. To this result he gives the preference
and deduces for the solar parallax 8’’.810+ 0.0062, adopting Hansen’s
value of the mean anomaly of the earth and eccentricity, Clarke’s value
for the equatorial radius of the earth, and Michelson and Newcomb’s
deterniination of the velocity of light, 186,325 miles per second.

Herr Nyrén has found in a discussion of the Pulkowa observations
of the difference of right ascension between Polaris and its companion,
evidence to confirm the hypothesis, upon which determinations of the
aberration constant rest, that the velocity of light is independent of
the state whether of motion or rest of the luminous body.

On the other hand the experiments of Michelson and Morley seem to
throw some doubt upon Fresnel’s hypotheses that the ether is at rest
exceptin transparent media, and that there it participates in the motion

of translation in the ratio a n being the index of refraction.
Loewy’s method of determining the constant of aberration from differ-
ential measurements of the changes in the distances of suitably-chosen
pairs of stars is to be tested at the Paris Observatory with an equatorial
coudé, and by Professor Comstock at the Washburn Observatory with
suitable apparatus fitted to the 6-inch equatorial. The method is essen-
tially to bring the two stars, which may be, say, 90 degrees apart in the
sky, into the field of an equatorial by reflection from the surfaces of a
12 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

double mirror at the objective: any change in the distance between the
two stars can then be measured with extreme nicety. Itshould perhaps
be mentioned that Houzeau claimed to have suggested this principle in
1871.

Diurnal nutation.—M. Niesten, in applying Folie’s formule for diurnal
nutation to the Greenwich observations of y Draconis, has found a posi-
tive parallax where Main and Downing obtained a negative value, and a
constant of aberration more closely agreeing with that generally adopted.
Introducing similar corrections in Halls discussion of the prime verti-
cal observations of a Lyre has, however, had no appreciable effect.

STAR-CATALOGUES AND CHARTS.

Paris Catalogue.—The first two volumes of the great work undertaken
by Leverrier a third of a century ago, the re-observation of the stars of
Lalande’s catalogue, have recently been published. The first volume is
the first installment of the catalogue proper, viz, stars from 0" to 6° of
right ascension, observed during the years 1837 to 1881; the second
volume gives the separate observations. Each series when complete
will extend to four volumes. The observations were made with the five
meridian instruments of the Paris Observatory, and include some 20,000
or 30,000 observations made between 1837 and 1854; they have there-
fore been divided into three periods, 183753, 185467, and 1868~81,
and severally reduced to the mean epochs 1845, 1860, or 1875. Obser-
vations subsequent to 1881, about one-fourth of the entire number, will be
published separately. The present section of the catalogue contains
7,245 stars, and represents about 80,000 observations in both elements.
It gives for each of the three periods the number of observations, the
mean date, the right ascension and north polar distance reduced to the
mean epoch, and a comparison with Lalande. The precessions for 1875
are also added. The introduction, by M. Gaillot, who has superin-
tended the reduction, contains a discussion of the probable errors of the
observations, and is followed by a comparison of the present catalogue
with Auwers’ Bradley, and an important investigation by M. Bessert
of the proper notions of a large number of stars, followed by a table of
errors in Lalande’s catalogue which the present and other catalogues
have brought to light.

Cincinnati Zone Catalogue-—Professor Porter has published the re-
sults of observations made with a 3-ineh transit instrument, at the Cin-
cinnati Observatory, upon 4,050 stars between the declinations —18° 50!
and —22° 20’, during the years 1885 to 1887. The faintest stars were of
about 8.5 magnitude, and nearly all the stars were observed three times.
The observations were made in zones, the telescope being clamped.
The transits which were recorded by the chronograph were generally
taken over five wires, and two bisections were made in declination when-
ever time allowed. The probable errors of « single observation are
+ 08,123 and + 1.84. An appendix gives the proper motion of sev-
enty-five stars dedueed from a comparison with other catalogues.
ASTRONOMY. 133

Dunsink Catalogue—The sixth part of the Dunsink observations is
devoted to a catalogue of 1,012 stars, between —2° and —23° declina-
tion, observed with the meridian circle from 1881 to 1885. The standard
stars employed are those of the Berlin Jahrbuch, and the observations
are reduced to Auwers’ system. The mean right ascensions and decli-
nations, with the annual precessions for the epoch 1885.0, the mean
epoch, and the number of observations are given.

Pulkowa.—V olume xi contains a catalogue for 1865.0 of the principal
stars, to the fourth magnitude—381 in number—as far as 15 degrees south
declination deduced from observations in the years 1861-1872. The for-
mation of a catalogue of these stars for the epoch 1845.0 was the first
piece of work completed by this observatory, and the present work is
thus enhanced in value by being an almost exact repetition of that un-
dertaken twenty years before.

Auwers’ new reduction of Bradley.—The third volume of Auwers’ new
reduction of Bradley, which has been five years in going through the
press, was finally published in 1888. ‘This volume contains, in addition
to the catalogue proper, tables giving the quantities in the reduction to
the apparent place that depend upon the star’s position, and a compar-
ison of Bradley’s positions, reduced to 1865, with Berlin and Greenwich
observations of about the same date. The catalogue contains 3,268
stars, and gives for each star the magnitude, right ascension, and dec-
lination for 1775.0, corrections to the Fundamenta of Bessels, number of
observations, epoch, precessions for 1755, 1810, and 1865, proper mo-
tions, references to Greenwich catalogues, and to double-star cata-
logues, where the star was double, and a column of notes.

An important list of 480 stars to be used as fundamental stars for
zone observations between —20° and —80° declination, is published
by Dr. Auwers in the Monthly Notices for June, 1887.

Dr. C. H. F. Peters has contributed two valuable papers to the third
volume of the Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences; the first
is a critical examination of all data bearing on Flamsteed’s twenty-two
“missing” stars, for each of which a plausible explanation is found;
and the second paper is a list of corrigenda in the catalogues, O. Arg.
S., Bonn vi, Weisse (1 and 2), Riimker, Schjellerup, Baily’s Lalande
zones, Yarnall, Glasgow, Santiago, and Geneva.

A very useful index to stars in Airy’s six Greenwich catalogues not
found in Flamsteed—the work of Miss Lamb—will be found in the
fifth volume of publications of the Washburn Observatory.

from the reports presented at the meeting of the Gesellschaft in August,
1887, show the progress of the work at that time:

Cambridge and —138° 50’ to —18° 10’ at Washington.

Star-charts.—Sectious 1 and Iv of the Southern Durchmusterung
charts (sheets 48, 53-63) have been published, bringing to a close that
most valuable work. Professor Schénfeld has issued with these last
numbers a short list of errata detected, which is reprinted in No. 2834
of the Nachrichten.

A series of charts embracing all the stars visible to the naked eye—
that is, down to about the sixth and one-half magnitude—has been pub-
lished by Mr. Cottam, and has been very highly complimented. There
are in all thirty-six sheets, the scale being one-third of an inch to one
degree of a great circle. Another useful book of the same kind is
Klein’s New Star-Atlas, which has appeared in both English and Ger-
man editions. There are eighteen maps, containing about the same
number of stars as Mr. Cottam’s, and giving also all the nebulie and
clusters visible in telescopes of moderate power—a great help to comet
hunters.

STELLAR PARALLAX.

Parallax of a Tauri.—Prof. Asaph Hall has published in No. 156 of
the Astronomical Journal, a determination of the purallax of « Tauri
from a series of observations with the 26-inch Washington equatorial,
extending from October 2, 1886, to March 15, 1887. The comparison-
star was an eleventh magnitude companion distant about 116’, in posi-
tion angle 34°.5. The resulting values of the relative parallax are:
From measures of position angle, 7=+0”.16340”.0409; and from
measures of distance, 7=+0.035+0/.0431. The mean value of the
parallax of a Tauri from these observations is, therefore, 7=0/’.102+
0.0296.

Prof. O. Struve, using the same comparison-star, recently obtained a
value nearly five times as great, namely, 7=0/.516+ 0.057,

Parallax of 2'1516.—Dr. L. de Ball, of the observatory of the Univer-
sity of Liége, has determined in a similar manner the parallax of the
ASTRONOMY. 135

brighter component (which has a sensible proper motion) of this optic-
ally double star. From measures of position angle he finds 7=+0.09L
+0.013; and from measures of distance, 7=+0.112+0/.010, The
mean result is z=+0/.104+ 0.008.

Parallax of = 2398.—A new investigation of the parallax of the double
star 2 2398 has been made by Dr. Lamp, based upon observations be-
tween May 20, 1885, and March 15, 1887. In this he not only obtains
a very satisfactory confirmation of his previous value of the parallax
(0.34) of the larger star, but he is able to show that the two stars are
at practically the same distance. For the principal star he finds the
annual parallax equal to 0/.3520+0’.0140; for the smaller, 0/.3548
+0”.0131; or for the mean, 0/.353+0.014. The magnitudes are 8.7
and 8.2, respectively, and the common proper motion about —0°.17 in
right ascension, and +1/.90 in declination annually.

Parallax of first-magnitude stars in the northern hemisphere.—Dr. Elkin
has completed his heliometer measures for the determination of the
parallax of the ten stars of the first magnitude in the northern hemi-
sphere, and summarizes his results in the following table:

The mean of the ten parallaxes gives for the mean parallax of a first-
magnitude star, +0/.089 +0”.015, a result according well with the
values deduced by Gyldén (0.084) and Peters (0.102).

The probable errors include an estimation of the probable systematic
error of the measures. They are therefore considerably larger than
those generally assigned to such results, which, as a rule, only take into
account the mere casual error of observation.

It will be seen on inspection of the table that of the ten stars six
may be said to give indications of a measurable parallax, but in only
two cases, a Canis Minoris and a Aquilx, are the values in any degree
remarkable, and these confirm closely results of former investigators ;
Auwers and Wagner having obtained +0/.240 +0/.029 and +0/.299
+0.038 respectively for Procyon, and W. Struve +0/.181 + 0.094 for
Altair. On the other hand, the next two largest results, those for
136 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

a Bootis and a Aurigee, do not confirm the large values found by
O. Struve, +0/.516 and +0/.505; but in the case of the former star
there is a close agreement with Hall, who got +0.102 +0/.030, and
there seems to be but little doubt that the Pulkowa value is largely
in error.

Of the four stars where the parallactic displacement has been inap-
preciable, Arcturus, with its large proper motion of over 2/’, second
only to that of a Centauri in all of the 200 brightest stars down to the
fourth magnitude, is especially note-worthy. The minuteness of the
parallax is beyond doubt, depending, as it does, on five pairs of com-
parison stars, all in reasonable agreement, and it can not be considered
as seriously at variance with the results previously obtained by Peters
and Johnson, +0127 +0.073 and -+0/.138 +0.052 respectively,
when their liability to systematic error is taken into account. The Yale
result for a Lyre does not fall in well with those hitherto deduced for
this star. If we commence at the epoch of W. Struve and neglect the
earlier attempts to find the absolute parallax, we have the following list
of values:

from which a parallax of about +0/.17 would seem well assured. The
pair of comparison stars used by Elkin are very symmetrical, and so
large a value would seem incompatible with the heliometer measures.
Photographic determination of stellar parallax.—Professor Pritchard,
of the Oxford University Observatory, pursuing his experimental work
upon the determination of stellar parallax by the help of photography,
has published the following interesting results. The last three are pro-
visional, having been determined from only six months’ observations :

Professor Pritchard lays stress upon the fact that each photographie
plate must be considered as carrying its own scale; and, due regard
being paid to the unavoidable, though slight, variations of scale in the
different plates, he is of opinion that in this delicate classof work pho-
tography wili give as accurate results as any other known method.

For 61 Cygni the value given rests upon the measurement of three
hundred and thirty plates, taken upon eighty-nine nights; each com-
ponent was referred to four comparison stars. On each of fifty-three
nights four photographic plates were taken of » Cassiopex, the ex-
posures varying from five to ten minutes. Experiments seemed to indi-
cate, however, that sufficiently approximate results, with a great saving
of labor, would be obtained by confining the observations to about five
nights in each of four periods of the year indicated by the position of
the parallactic ellipse. Professor Pritchard proposes to apply this
method systematically to all those stars between magnitudes one and
one-half and two and one-half which attain at Oxford a suitable alti-
tude; and he hopes to obtain good results for all of these stars that have
a parallax not less than the thirtieth of a second of are.

DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS.

Extension of the law of gravitation to stellar systems.—Professor Hall,
in a discussion of this question in the Astronomical Journal, after a re-
view of the various speculations upon the subject, says: ‘*The weakness
of the proof that the Newtonian law governs the motions of double
stars arises from two sources. In the first place, the errors of obser-
vation have a large ratio to the quantities measured. This condition
makes it difficult to compute the orbits with much accuracy, or we may
satisfy the observations with very different elements. - - - The
insufficiency in the data can only be removed by further observation.
Since there is no theoretical difficulty in the way, the continuation of
the observations of double stars and the improvement of methods of ob-
servation will, in time, give the means for the accurate determination
of their apparent orbits. The theoretical difficulty in proving the law
of Newton for double stars can not be overcome. But we can increase
the probability of the existence of this law by determining more orbits
138 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

and those that are very differently situated. If the law prove satis-
factory in all cases, we shall have a probability of its universality in-
creasing with the progress of astronomy.” But, although this proba-
bility may be very great, it can not constitute a proof offering the char-
acter of experimental certainty which clothes the law of Newton itself
in our planetary system. 5

A serious difficulty is encountered in the enormous velocities with
which quite a number of stars appear to be moving through space, “run-
away” Groombridge—1830, 4 Cassiopee, 6 Hydri, a Bootis, and others.
Some of these velocities are comparable to that of a comet in close prox-
imity to the sun, but in most cases there is no visible object near the
one in motion to which we can ascribe an attractive force, acting accord-
ing to the Newtonian law, which would produce the velocity observed,
unless we assume enormous masses.

An interesting article upon this subject is contributed by M. Tisse-
rand to the Bulletin Astronomique for January, 1887.

Milan Double star observations. —Professor Schiaparelli has published,
in the Milan volume 33, his first series of double star observations made
at that observatory with the 8-inch refractor from 1874 to 1885. There
are four hundred and sixty-five stars in his list, and in most of them
the components are less than 5” apart. In an appendix are given the
mean results for a number of the closest pairs as measured with the
18-inch refractor. With this instrument he discovered that the prinei-
pal star of ¢ Hydre is itself a very close double, the magnitudes of the
two components being 4 and 5.5, and distance 0.2 or 0.25. The first
part of the volume contains a detailed description of the optical per-
formance of the 8-inch refractor, a discussion of the errors of the mi-
crometer and of the accidental errors of observation, and a very full
comparison with Dembowski’s measures. The differences in the deter-
mination of position angle due to the varying inclination of the line
joining the two stars to the line of the observer’s eyes are also investi-
gated, but the reversion prism was not used. Professor Schiaparelli
finds that his measures of distance are free from systematic errors, due
to personality, but his position angles have a tendency to be small as
compared with those of other observers.

Professor Hough has published a catalogue of two hundred and nine
new double stars discovered and measured by himself with the 183-inch
refractor of the Dearborn Observatory. Short lists of uew doubles
discovered with the McCormick 26-inch, and the Lick 36-inch, have also
been published. Burnham’s list of his discoveries with the 36-inch re-
fractor in three months is very interesting, containing as it does new
companions to vy Cassiope, 11 mag., 2.2 distant; and a Tauri, 12 mag.,
2.3 distant.

The following table contains the results of recent computations of
the orbits of binary stars. The star 6 Hquulei is of especial interest,
as the period of eleven and a half years assigned to it is the shortest of
any known pair.

The multiple star € Cancri.—Professor Seeliger’s recent investigations
have confirmed the results of his earlier work, and those obtained by
Struve in 1874. ‘The threestars A, B, and C have the magnitudes re-
spectively, 5.0, 5.7, and 5.3. The proper motion of the system amounts
in a century to +10°%.6 in right ascension, and to —11” in declination.
The close pair, A and B, have a motion round each other in about sixty
years, their apparent distance varying from about 0.6 to 1.1; whilst
C, the more distant companion, has moved through about 55° of posi-
tion angle round the other two since Herschel’s observations in 1781,
its distance never very greatly varying from 54’. The motion of A
and b round their common center of gravity does not appear to be dis-
turbed to any appreciable extent by the influence of C, which is so placed
as not to affect their apparent relative motions, even though a very con-
siderable mass beassigned to it, and as a fact Professor Seeliger finds, for

cal retrogression of © itself which is most easily accounted for by sup-
posing the presence of a close companion, one hitherto undetected, and
therefore either entirely dark or but faintly luminous. The distance of
this companion is probably only a few tenths of a second, the distance of
C from the point, s., round which it appears to revolve, and which may
reasonably be assumed to be the center of gravity of itself and of D, the
as yet undiscovered fourth member of the family, being only about one-
fifth of a second. The entire group may then be considered as a double
double.

VARIABLE AND COLORED STARS.

Chandler’s catalogue of variable stars.—The most important work upon
variable stars since Schoenfeld’s “ Zweiter Catalog,” now thirteen years
old, is a new catalogue published by Mr. 8S. C. Chandler as Nos. 179 and
180 of the Astronomical Journal. In the absence of any later catalogue
from Schoenfeld this immediately takes its place as the standard, though
the author states that it is preliminary to a more complete catalogue
which will embody a series of observations and definitive investigations
now in hand.

An analysis of the catalogue shows that of the 225 stars comprised
in it 160 are distinetly variable; in 12 the periodic character is rather
uncertainly defined; 14 are distinctly irregular; 12 belong to the so-
called nove, or have been seen at only one appearance; and the 27 re-
maining have been toa little observed for the character of the variation
to be properly known. Of the 160 periodical variables, epochs of both
maximum and minimum are assigned for 63; maximum epochs alone
for 82; minimum epochs alone for 14,9 of these being of the Algol
type, while in one the period alone is given. The elements of 124 stars
are the results of Mr. Chandler’s own investigations; 22 are taken from
Schoenfeld; and 14 from other computers after Mr. Chandler had care-
fully confirmed them. The systematic perturbations shown by many
of the periods have received attention, and the further study of this
subject promises important additions to our knowledge of the causes
of stellar variation.

A useful novelty introduced in numbering the stars calls for unquali-
fied approval. Instead of giving them consecutive numbers each is dis-
tinguished by a number equal to one-tenth of the right ascension ex-
pressed in time-seconds for the equinox 1900.0. In this way the numer-
ation need not be disturbed by fresh discoveries.

The catalogue gives in successive columns a serial number assigned
in the way just described; Schoenfeld’s number; the right ascension
and declination for 1855, and the annual variations; the discoverer ;
date of discovery; redness on an arbitrary scale; magnitude at maxi-
mum and at minimum; Greenwich mean time of maximum and mini-
mum; period; remarks; and approximate place for 1900.

A very ingenious method of estimating the colors was employed by
Mr. Chandler; it consists in estimating the relative change in bright-
ness effected in two stars by the interposition, first, of a blue and then
of ared shade glass. If a red and a white star appear of the same
brightness, when viewed directly, the red star will seem the fainter
when the blue glass is interposed, but the brighter with the red glass;
and these differences of brightness can be very precisely estimated by
Argelander’s method, and they thus afford definite measures of the
differences in color of the two stars on an arbitrary scale depending
upon the glasses employed. Mr. Chandler finds that the effect of
brightness upon the scale-estimates is imperceptible, at least between
ASTRONOMY. 141

the second and ninth magnitudes. An important result of his obser-
vations is the intimate connection shown between the length of period
and the depth of color of the star; the very short-period variables are
nearly white; those of longer period somewhat redder, the tint grow-
ing deeper, the longer the period.

Several new variable stars have been detected by Chandler, Sawyer,
Espin, and others, and among them are two of more than ordinary in-
terest, as they apparently belong to the well-known “ Algol-type.” The
first was discovered by Mr. Chandler in the constellation Cygnus (Y
Cygni), right ascension =20" 47".5; declination =+34° 14/ (DM, +
34°, 4181). Its light varies from 7.1 magnitude to about 7.9 magni-
tude, and the period is probably 14 11" 56™ 48s, The second star re-
ferred to, was discovered by Mr. Sawyer in March, 1887, in the constel-
lation Canis Major, and as it is the first undoubted variable found in
that constellation, it will probably be known as RK Canis Majoris. Its
position for 1887 is right ascension =7" 14™.4; declination =—16° 11’,
The minimum observed by Mr. Sawyer was 6.7 magnitude, and the
period is 143" 15™ 55%. Mr. Chandler has collected the observations of
U Uphiuchi, of all variables the one with shortest period and the most
rapid fluctuations of light, and he finds a curious but well-marked re-
tardation in the inerease of brillianey some half-hour or so after mini-
mum is passed. A similar irregularity has been noticed in the light-
curve of S Caneri and occasionally in that of Algol.

Mr. Chandler strongly urges the possessors of large refractors to
devote a portion of their time to the observation of the minima of vari-
ables that become too faint for ordinary telescopes, our knowledge of
such variables being extremely deficient. Argelander’s method of ob-
servation is recommended.

Professor Pickering has in preparation an index to observations of
variable stars which will give for each star the number of observations -
each year since the discovery of variability. This index will be pub-
lished in volume 18 of the Annals of the Harvard Observatory.

In an interesting article published in the Observatory (April, 1888),
Miss Clerke has collected a series of notes upon variable double stars.
These stars show for the most part a spectrum analogous to that of
Sirius, that is of Class I, although single stars of that class hardly ever
show any fluctuations in brightness. Algol-variables, if the eclipse
theory of their changes be admitted, make no exceptions to this rule ;
Gore’s catalogue contains three examples: 6 Orionis, S Monocerotis,
and Y Virginis, and among the well-known doubles are y Virginis,
€ Bootis, z Bootis, 38 Geminorum, a Piscium, 6 Serpentis, and / Scor-
pii, and perhaps 6 Cygni. With few and doubtful exceptions, revolv-
ing double stars vary in concert, if they vary at all. The changes of
y Virginis illustrate the mode of procedure in this respect of couples
intrinsically equal. They alternate in each component, and can thus
be detected only by close attention. Each may be described as nor-
142 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

mally of the third magnitude; and each in turn declines by about half
a magnitude and recovers within a few days, yet so that the general
preponderance, during a cycle of several years, remains to the same
star. Miss Clerke suggests that simultaneous variation in the color of
neighboring stars may lead to the discovery of their physical depend-
ence.

Mr. G. F. Chambers has prepared a catalogue (still in manuscript) of
seven hundred and eleven red stars, brighter than the eight and one-
half magnitude, the result of observations made from 1870 to 1886;
less than twelve stars, according to Mr. Chambers, can properly be
termed carmine or ruby.

STELLAR PHOTOMETRY.

The magnitudes of the standard stars of the British, French, German,
Spanish, and American nautical almanacs have been rediscussed by
Professor Pickering, and his results will probably be adopted in future
issues of the French, Spanish, and American works. The plan pro-
posed was, that the magnitude adopted for each star should be the
mean of those derived from the Harvard Photometry, the photometric
observations of Wolff, the Uranometria Oxoniensis, and the Urano-
metria Argentina. The list published embraces 800 stars, and of these
the magnitudes of all but 64 depend upon at least two and generally
upon three authorities; 132 stars being common to all four of the
adopted standard catalogues of brightness.

A “wedge-photometer,” constructed under the direction of Professor
Pritchard for the Harvard Observatory, has been submitted to a careful
examination by Professors Langley, Young, and Pickering, and it ap-
pears from Professor Langley’s investigation of the wedge, by means
of his bolometer, that there is a selective absorption of light throughout
the wedge; feeble in the more luminous portion of the spectrum, but
of such a character that, broadly speaking, the transmissibility always
increases from the violet toward the red, increasing very greatly in the
infra-red, These results have been confirmed by Professor Pickering’s
experiments, and they emphasize the danger, already recognized by
Professor Pritchard, of employing an instrument of this kind in the
observation of deeply-colored stars.

From a comparison of the star-magnitudes of the Oxford Uranometry
with those of Wolff’s second catalogue, and with those of the Harvard
Photometry, Professor Pickering has found that the Oxford magnitudes
are, on the average, less than the Harvard magnitudes for stars down
to the third magnitude, but greater for the fourth and fifth, and less
again for stars below the sixth. The Harvard catalogue differs less
from those of Wolff and Pritchard than the two latter do from each
other,

STELLAR SPECTRA.

Photographie study of stellar spectra. Henry Draper memorial.—Pro-
fessor Pickering, in his annual report for 1888, presents the progress
made in the various investigations of stellar spectra as follows: A cata-
logue has been prepared of the spectra of 10,875 stars, covering the
entire sky north of --25°. The 8-inch Bache telescope has been used
for this work. Six hundred and thirty-three plates have been taken,
and 27,953 spectra have been examined. The type of spectrum is
given in each case, and in about six thousand cases additional lines are
visible and have accordingly been described. The photographie in-
tensities of the spectra have also been measured, giving a photometric
measure of the stars by which those of different colors may be com-
pared. The first draft of a spectroscopic catalogue has been prepared,
including the place of each star for 1900, its designation and magni-
tude in various catalogues, its photographic brightness, and the descrip-
tion of each spectrum. The photographs required for the second inves-
tigation on the spectra of the fainter stars are nearly completed. The
instruments employed in both of these investigations were prepared
for shipment to Peru, where the work will be continued among the
southern constellations. The detailed study of the brighter stars with
the 11-inch Draper telescope has been extended by the use of plates
stained with erythrosin. The sodium line D in these spectra has thus
been photographed as a double line. A catalogue has been formed of
the lines in some of the brighter stars. In Sirius the lines, except
those due to hydrogen, are very faint. But nearly four hundred of
them have been measured in different photographs of this star; fifteen
are recorded between the lines H and K. A beginning has also been
made of the study of the spectra of the variable stars.

Dr. von Konkoly and his assistant, Dr. Kévesligethy, have carried
the spectroscopic survey of the heavens begun by Vogel and Dunér to
15 degrees south declination, and have published their work in volume
8, part 2, of the O’Gyalla observations. The instrument used was a
Zoellner spectroscope. Vogel’s arrangement of types was followed.
The catalogue contains in all 2,022 stars, down to 7.5 magnitude. But
one bright line spectrum was suspected, a star of 6.5 magnitude 50/
north of € Orionis, and this star, as well as 4, 6, and ¢ Orionis, is found
to have a variable spectrum.

Among the peculiarities detected in stellar spectra may be noted the
discovery by Espin on August 13, 1888, of a bright line in the spectrum
of the variable star R Cygni; and as Dunér found it in 187982 of a weak
IL type, an extraordinary change seems to have taken plaee. Espin’s
bright line was apparently of a temporary character, and faded rapidly.

Motion of stars in the line of sight.—The spectroscopic observations for
the determination of the motions of stars in the line of sight have been
continued at Greenwich and at the Temple Observatory, Rugby, the
144 RECORD OF SCIENGE FOR 1887 AND. 1888.

only two observatories that have thus far given systematic attention
to this important line of work. The most interesting results are in the
case of Sirius, which, when first observed at Greenwich in the winter of
1875-76, seemed to be receding from us at the rate of 24 miles per
second. This recession gradually changed to an approach of 5 miles
per second in 1882-83, increasing to 24 miles in 188586, and then
dropping to 1 mile in 1886~87, and now becoming a recession again, in
1887, of 6 miles per second. As the Astronomer Royal remarks, these
results are to be accepted with caution; the F line for which the meas-
ures were made would seem to have changed somewhat its character-
istics, and the observation is moreover one of extreme difficulty, the
discordances obtained on different nights being almost as great as the
whole range of displacement noted.

Dr. Vogel, of Potsdam, has successfully applied photography to the
determination of the displacement of lines in stellar spectra due to a
motion of the star in the line of sight. Two Rutherford prisms were
used, the observations being made on the third line of hydrogen, H;.
Dr. Scheiner, who has been carrying out these experiments, has exam-
ined the spectra of Sirius, Procyon, Castor, Arcturus, Aldebaran, Pol-
lux, and Rigel. Of these, Sirius showed a slight displacement toward
the red, thus indicating a motion away from us; Procyon a decided dis-
placement, and Rigel a very large one in the same direction, while Arc-
turus showed a considerable displacement towards the violet. A sys-
tematic examination of all stars of the first and second magnitudes is
to be undertaken with improved apparatus.

ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

The Paris International Astrophotographic Congress.—The general in-
terest in the application of photography to astronomical observations
has resulted in a meeting called by the French Academy of Sciences,
at the instance of Admiral Mouchez, for the purpose of uniting upon
a plan for preparing by international co-operation a photographie
chart of the heavens more extensive than any hitherto attempted
by the usual methods. The Congress was opened at the Paris Ob-
servatory on April 16, 1887, by M. Flourens, minister of foreign af-
fairs of the French Government, and addresses were made by M. Ber-
trand, the eminent mathematician, by Admiral Mouchez, director of the
Paris Observatory, and by Professor Struve, director of the Pulkowa
Observatory. Fifty-six members were present, including thirty-seven
foreign astronomers, representing sixteen nations. Admiral Mouchez
was chosen honorary president; Strnve, president; Auwers, Christie,
and Taye, vice-presidents; Bakhuyzen and Tisserand, secretaries, and
Dunér and Trépied, assistant secretaries. At the first meeting a com-
mittee of nineteen was appointed to consider and report upon the size
and construction of the instruments to be employed, and upon the limit
of star-magnitudes to be included in the photographs. This committee
ASTRONOMY. 145

reported on April 19, and after some discussion it was decided to divide
the Congress into two sections—one to deal with purely astronomical
questions, and the other with questions pertaining to the photographic
side of the problem. Hach section drew up a series of resolutions which
were further discussed and amended by the Congress in full session, the
result being an agreement to adopt refracting telescopes of 13 inches
aperture and 114 feet focal length, and to undertake two series of pho-
tographs of the entire sky, one taking in stars as faint as the fourteenth
magnitude, the other stopping at the eleventh. The ultimate aim is to
convert the positions of the stars upon these last plates into the usual
co-ordinates of right ascension and declination, and to publish them in
the form of a star catalogue, and to prepare from the series embracing
the fainter stars a set of glass positives for each of the co-operating ob-
servatories or nations.
Following are the resolutions in detail as finally adopted:

(1) The progress made in astronomical photography demands tnat
astronomers of the present day should unite in undertaking a descrip-
tion of the heavens by photograhpic means.

(2) This work shall be carried out at selected stations, and the instru-
ments shall be identical in their essential parts.

(3) The principal objects shall be: a. To prepare a general photo-
graphic chart of the heavens for the present epoch, and to obtain data
which shall enable us to determine the positions and magnitudes of all
stars down toa certain magnitude, with the greatest possible accuracy
_ (magnitudes being understood in a photographic sense to be defined

later). b. To be able to utilize in the best way, both in the present and
in the future, the data obtained by photographic means.

(4) The instruments employed shail be exclusively refractors.

(5) The stars shall be photographed as far as the fourteenth magni-
tude, inclusive; this magnitude being indicated provisionally by the
seale actually in use in France, and with the reservation that its pho-
tographic value shall be definitely fixed afterward.

(6) The aperture of the object-glasses shall be 0.383 meter (13.
inches), and the focal length about 3.43 meters (114 feet), so that a
minute of are shall be represented approximately by 0.001 meter.

(7) The directors of observatories shall be at liberty to have the object-
glasses made where they desire, provided they fulfill the general con-
ditions laid down by the Congress.

(8) The aplanatism and achromatism of the objectives shall be caleu-
lated for radiations near the Iraunhofer ray G.

(9) All the plates shall be prepared according to the same formula ;
this formula to be subsequently agreed upon.

(10) A permanent control of these plates from the point of view of
their relative sensibility to the different radiations shall be instituted.

(11) Questions in regard to the preservation aud reproduction of the
negatives can not at present be settled, and shall be referred to a

special committee.
(12) The same conclusions are adopted in regard to the photographie
magnitudes of the stars.

(13) Resolution 8 above, in regard to the aplanatism and achromatism
of the object-glasses, shall be understood in the sense that the mini-
mum focal distance shall be that of a ray near G, so as to attain the
Inaximum sensibility of the photographic plates.

H, Mis. 142

146 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

(14) The object-glasses shall be constructed in such a manner that
the field to be measured shall extend at least 1 degree from the center.

(15) In order to eliminate fictitious stars and to avoid inconvenience
from minute specks which may exist upon the plates, two series of
negatives shall be made for the whole sky.

(16) The two series of negatives shall be so made that the image of
a star situated in the corner of a plate of the first series shall be found
as nearly as possible in the center of a plate of the second series.

(17) Besides the two negatives giving the stars down to the four-
teenth magnitude another series shall be made with shorter exposures,
to assure a greater precision in the micrometrical measurement of the
fundamental stars, and render possible the construction of a catalogue.

(18) The supplementary negatives, destined for the construction of the
catalogue, shall contain all the stars down to the eleventh magnitude
approximately. The executive committee shall determine the steps to
be taken to insure the fulfillment of this condition.

(19) Each photographic plate to be used in the formation of the cata-
logue shall be accompanied by all the data necessary to obtain the
orientation and the value of its scale; and, as far as possible, these data
shall be written on the plate itself. Hach plate of this kind shall show
a well-centered copy of a system of cross-wires for the purpose of elimi-
nating errors which may be produced by a subsequent deformation of
the photographie film. Further details of this nature shall be deter-
mined by the executive committee.

(20) In the negatives intended for the map the number of cross-wires
to be used in their control and reduction shall be reduced to a mint-
mum.

(21) The tubes of the photographic instruments shall be constructed
of the metal most likely to give an invariable focal plane and shall carry
a graduation for the determination and regulation of the position of the
plate.

(22) The executive committee shall choose the reference stars to be
used.

(23) The question of the methods of measurement and the conversion
of the numbers obtained into right ascensions and declinations for the
equinox of 1900 is left to the executive committee. That committee
shall first occupy itself with the study and methods of use of measuring-
instruments, giving either rectangular or polar co-ordinates, and based
upon the simultaneous use of scales for the larger distances, and mi-
crometer screws for scale subdivisions.

(24) The connection of the plates will be effected in conformity with
resolution No. 16.

At the last general session, April 25, the Congress delegated its pow-
ers to a permanent committee, consisting of the directors of the observa-
tories actually taking part in the work, and the following eleven mem-
bers chosen by ballot, viz.: Christie, Dunér, Gill, Prosper Henry, Janssen,
Loewy, Pickering, Struve, Tacchini, Vogel, and Weiss. The observa-
tories of Algiers, Bordeaux, Cape of Good Hope, Greenwich, La Plata,
Melbourne, Oxford, Paris, Potsdam, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, San Fer-
nando, Sydney, Tacubaya, Toulouse, have been pledged to co-operate,
and the instruments for several of them are well advanced. No observa-
tory in the United States has thus far signified definitely its intention of
co-operating, though the Government has been appealed to to appropri-

ate the necessary funds for the Washington Observatory. The business
of the permanent committee is transacted through an executive bureau,
consisting of Admiral Mouchez, president; Christie, Dunér, Janssen,
Struve, and Tacchini, members, and Gill, Loewy, and Vogel, secretaries,
It is expected that meetings of the permanent committee will be held
every three years, though they may be called more frequently if found
desirable. Before adjourning, the Congress elected also a special com-
mittee, to occupy itself with the application of photography to astron-
omy other than the construction of a map, acting in eoncert with the
permanent committee. Messrs. Common and Janssen were requested
to take charge of this matter. They have communicated by circular
with all who are likely to be interested in this work, and propose to call
a meeting at Paris, and form a committee for the consideration of the
best means of carrying out the plan suggested by the Congress.

As many preliminary experiments are necessary in arranging details,
special subjects of investigation have been referred to different astron-
omers. For instance, the study of the proper form of reticule, to Vogel;
photographic magnitudes, to Struve and Pickering; optical deformation
of images, to Struve; study of three or four stars nearly in a straight
line, embracing an angular distance of about 1 degree, and photographed
necessarily at the center and corner of a plate, to the observatories of
Algiers, Leyden, Paris, Pulkowa; distortion of the sensitive film, to Al-
giers, Meudon, Potsdam; curved plates, Christie; orientation of the
plates, the Cape, Paris; measuring apparatus, to a special committee;
formula for the preparation of the plates, Abney, Eder; the effect of
colors of the stars upon the photographic magnitude, Dunér.

The permanent committee has published, through the Paris Academy,
three reports: the first, a full account of the Congress held in April,
1887; the other two, “bulletins,” containing correspondence and results
of the preliminary investigations. These papers are of great importance
in the proposed photographic work, but they can hardly be reviewed
satisfactorily here. The most extensive are: ‘‘ Note sur application de
la photographie aux mesures micrométriques des étoiles, T.-N. Thiele ;
De Vinfluence des durées de la pose sur Vexactitude des photographies
stellaires, J. Scheiner; Travaux préparatoires effectués 4 Vobservatoire

de Harvard College sur les résultats photométriques, E. C. Pickering;
Etendue du champ des clichés photographiques de Vobservatoire de
Paris, MM. Henry.”

It is strongly recommended that the plates be measured at a central
bureau established in the neighborhood of Paris.

Professor Pritchard having undertaken, for the photographie com-
mittee of the Royal Society, an examination of two silver-on-glass mit-
rors of the same aperture but of very different focal lengths, with a view
of ascertaining the practical effects of focal length on the photographie
148 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

field, has concluded that mirrors are unsuitable for any extensive chart-
ing, particularly mirrors of short focal length; at the same time there
is no doubt as to their capacity for the singularly accurate delineation
of small portions of the heavens, and for such operations as those con-
nected with stellar parallax or the charting of the moon.

Mr. Roberts has described in the Monthly Notices (49: 5-13) an in-
strument which he calls the *‘stellar pantograver,” intended to surmount
the difficulties of reproducing the negatives after they have been ob-
tained. Itis essentially an instrument for engraving upon copper plates
points of the same size and in the same relative positions as those de-
picted by the photographs.

In the long exposures of two hours and upwards that some of the
photographs have required there is considerable danger of displace-
ments of the images upon the plates due to variations in the refraction.
Dr. Dreyer has found that in latitude +50° such displacements are not
likely to exceed 0.5 (and will therefore not affect sensibly the symmetry
of the images) in the case of an equatorial star moving from 27™ east
to 27™ west of the meridian or in the ease of a star of +25° declination
moving from 39™ east to 39™ west.

The photographic work of Professor Pickering upon stellar spectra,
and of Gothard, Vogel and Roberts upon nebule, has been mentioned
under these headings. Rapid progress has been made by Dr. Gill with
his southern photographic Durchmusterung.

COMETS.

Comet Encke (1888 I1).—Encke’s well-known periodic comet was
picked up by Mr. Tebbutt, of Windsor, New South Wales, with the
help of the ephemeris of Backlund and Seraphinoff, on July 8, 1888,
ten days after it had passed perihelion. In a 44-inch telescope it ap-
peared as a small, bright, well-condensed nebula, about 1’ in diam-
eter, without a nucleus. It was observed at Windsor till August 1,
when it was ‘of the last degree of faintness,” and at the Cape to
August 9, but it was unfavorably situated for observation in the
northern hemisphere.

Berberich has discussed the brightness of Eneke’s comet as seen at
different returns from 1786 to 1885, and calls attention to the rather
remitrkable circumstance that the comet has been most conspicuous
when seen near a time of maximum of solar spots, and least when re-
turning near a minimum.

Comet Faye (1858 [V).—Found by Perrotin, at Nice, August 9, 1883,
by the help of a sweeping ephemeris prepared by Kreutz. It was de-
scribed as a very faint, circular nebulosity about one minute in extent,
with a slight central condensation. Although it remained visible as
late as February, 1889, on account of its extreme faintness but few
observations seemed to have been secured. Maximum brightness was
reached about the beginuing of December. The correction to the
ASTRONOMY. 149

ephemeris computed directly from the elements was —4™.4; + 4’, corre-
sponding to a retardation of the perihelion time of about two days.

Comet Olbers, originally discovered by the celebrated Dr. Olbers on
March 6, 1815, was picked up by Brooks on August 24, 1887, inde-
dendently of Ginzel’s ephemeris. Bessel, who made a discussion of
the earlier observations, predicted a return to perihelion on February
9, 1887, and Dr. Ginzel, rediscussing the orbit in a very elaborate
manner, found the most probable date of perihelion to be Decem-
ber 17, 1886, with an uncertainty of 1.6 years. Perihelion actually
occurred on October 8, 1887. Especial interest attaches to this comet
as the third member of the group of comets having a period of about
seventy-five years (Halley’s, Pons’, and Olbers’), which has returned
to perihelion in conformity with prediction. Kammermann, at Geneva,
described it on August 29, 1887, as a bright 7.8 magnitude, with a faint
tail. There seems to be no reason for supposing that it has lost any-
thing of its ight-giving power since its previous appearance in 1815.
The last observation at this return was made at the Lick Observatory
on July 5, 1888, when the theoretical brightness was less than one-
tenth that at the time of discovery.

Comet Tempel.—YThe comet discovered by Tempel on July 3, 1873, and
found to have a period of five and one quarter years, was observed at its
return in 1878, but escaped observation in 1883 when it was due at peri-
helion on November 20, The conditions of visibility seem to be even
' worse for the return of 1889, the comet remaining too near the sun,
while the circumstances of the return in 1894 are but little different
from those of 1883.

Comet Winnecke.—Von Haerdtl has rediscussed the motion of Win-
necke’s comet, making use of observations at a later return than Op-
polzer could employ in 1880. The object was to detect, if possible, any
increase in the mean motion similar to that exhibited by Encke’s comet,
though not sensible in Faye’s comet, possibly owing to its great perihe-
lion distance. He finds no acceleration whatever of the mean motion,
the actual figures indicating rather a slight retardation, but far too
small to justify any conclusion other than absence of change in the
mean motion and length of period.

mation it appeared that the comet was seen at Blauwberg, near Cape
Town, on the same evening, by a farmer and a fisherman, and a day or
two later it was seen at several places in Australia. Dr. Thome was
150 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

not able to confirm his discovery till January 20. From the 22d to the
25th the comet was a beautiful object to the naked eye—a narrow,
straight, sharply defined, graceful tail, over 40 degrees long, shining
with a soft starry light against the dark sky, beginning, apparently,
without a head, and gradually widening and fading as it extended up-
wards. At the Cape of Good Hope it was observed from January 22
to 28, the long, straight tail recalling the comet of February, 1880. The
Revista do observatorio for February, published by Dr. Cruls at Rio
Janeiro, gives a sketch of the comet made on January 24. The nucleus
was then somewhere beyond the bright star a Gruis, invisible in the
haze of the horizon, and the tail stretched up beyond / Hydrae, a nar-
row ribbon 52 degrees in length and about half a degree in width. As
far as we have been able to learn the comet was not seen at all in the
northern hemisphere, and was not followed in the southern hemisphere
beyond the end of January.

Unfortunately, also, no well-defined nucleus, or even the slightest

condensation as a point of observation could be made out at any of the
observatories at which the comet was visible, and from the rough ob-
servations which were obtained it is impossible to determine the orbit
with any degree of precision. The earlier dispatches suggested the
identity of the new comet with the great comet of 1880, apparently on
the ground of a general similarity of the circumstances of the apparition,
and on the fact that the line of sight nearly intersected the orbit of the
comet of 1880; but Mr. Chandler, who has made a critical discussion of
all the observations obtained, has been unable to reconcile them with an
orbit similar to that of the group of great comets of 1543, 1880, and 1882;
the orbit that he obtains bears a closer resemblance, in fact, to those of
the comets of 1680 and 1689. The unavoidable uncertainty in the ob-
servations must, however, leave the question of identity unsettled.
The extremely small perihelion distance is worthy of notice, and may,
perhaps, account for the lack of nucleus. Indeed, if we accept the orbit
computed by Dr. Oppenheim (q=0.0047), the comet must have ploughed
through the surface of the sun itself.
Comet 1887 IT: Discovered by W. R. Brooks, at Phelps, New York,
_ == Comet 6 1887. | on the evening of January 22, 1887, in the constella-
tion Draco. In the early part of February it reached its greatest north-
ern declination, 80°, then went south again, and was last observed |
by Plummer at Orwell Park, on April 23. From the time of discovery
it increased gradually in brightness till about the middle of February,
when it was described as a bright telescopic object about 3/ in diam-
eter with well marked central condensation of the tenth magnitude.
According to the yet unfinished investigation of Dr. Stechert the orbit
shows a well-marked ellipticity.

wards the north and west; last observed on April 10, at Orwell Park.
The ordinary formula for brightness, which assumes that the comet
shines by reflected sunlight only, seems to have failed in this case, as in
many others; in the middle of March, when its theoretical brightness
was 0.12 that at the time of discovery, it was apparently as well seen as
during the first days of its appearance.

Comet 1887 IV: Barnard’s third comet of 1887 was discovered at
= Comet e187. 11 o’clock on the evening of May 12, in right as-

cension 15", declination—31°. On May 13 it was described by Boss as
having a star-like nucleus of the 11.5 magnitude. It increased some-
what in brightness till about the middle of June, developing a tail
which attained a length of 5’.. It moved rapidly north, and on account
of its brightness and favorable situation was well observed, till August
11. Mr. Muller has already completed a definitive orbit, and finds that
the observations are represented by an ellipse somewhat better than
by a parabola.

= Comet a 1888. | Hope, on February 18, 1888, or the early morning
of February 19, civil reckoning, the comet being readily seen with the
naked eye, with sharply defined nucleus of the seventh magnitude in

with an opera-glass. The rapid northerly motion brought it, by the
12th of March, into view in the northern hemisphere, where it was fol-
lowed until September, being reported visible to the naked eye until
the first part of May. Thome, at Cordoba, described it as a fine naked-
eye object, with a tail, at its maximum, 5° iv length and a nucleus of
three and one-half magnitude. Remarkable fluctuations occurred in
the brightness of the head, during the months of March and May, re-
sembling the phenomena noted in the great September comet of 1832
and the Pons-Brooks comet of 1834.

On the 19th of March the main eighth magnitude nucleus was seen to
have an eleventh magnitude companion, and on the 27th of the month
a third faint nucleus was detected; the triple nucleus was last seen
on the 4th of June. Between the 19th and 21st of May it became five
or six times brighter than during the days immediately preceding, and
from the nucleus two bright streamers were shot out, curving backward
on either side of the nucleus into the tail. This sudden outburst is al!
the more difficult to account for as it occurred two months after peri-
helion; it is to be regretted that no spectroscopic observations were
obtained at this critical period. The spectroscopic observations made
in March and April showed a faint, broad, continuous spectrum, in ad-

dition to the three characteristic hydrogen bands. The orbit, accord-
ing to Berberich, is undoubtedly elliptic, the period, from his preliminary
computation, being 2,570 years.

helion had taken place some forty-eight days before discovery, but the
increasing distance from the sun was largely compensated for by the
approach to the earth, so that the comet was observed for several
months in 1889,

Comet 1889 I:

Comet e 1833.

This comet was discovered by Barnard at the Lick
Observatory, with a 4-inch comet-seeker, on Septem-
ber 2, 1833, or the morning of September 3, and also independently by
Brooks, at Geneva, on the following morning. It was a round nebulous
mass 1’, in diameter, with a central condensation of 11-12 magnitude
and no tail. At the end of November it reached its maximum bright-
ness, twelve times as bright as at discovery, and appeared to the naked
eye like a nebulous star of the sixth magnitude. It will not pass peri-
helion till January 31, 1889,

The spectrum, according to Dr. Copeland, on November 14, instead
of being composed of the usual feeble separate bands, was continuous,
rather long, extending from wave-lengths 575 to 450 of Angstrém’s Heats
brighter in the middle and fading gradually at both ends; it resembled
the spectrum of a close globular star-cluster or of a non-gaseous nebula,
rather than that of a self-luminous gas. Faint patches of light were
made out in the positions usually occupied by the second and third
cometary bands. Similar observations were made later, and on Decem-
ber 8, all three bands were distinctly visible, but on each occasion the
continuous spectrum formed the ground on which the brighter spectrum
was superposed. ‘It seems probable that the comet shines mainly by
reflected light, - - - to which the action of the sun on the cometary
material is slowly adding the usual bright bands.”

154 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

Prof. Daniel Kirkwood has suggested that certain comets of short
period may have originated within the solar system. Wolf’s comet
(1884 IIL), for example, before its last near approach to Jupiter, had an
eccentricity of 0.28, which is exceeded by twelve known asteroids, and
the elements of Tempel’s comet (1867 II) do not differ greatly from
those of an eccentric asteroid. Out of twenty short-period comets,
seven have disappeared either by dissolution, like Biela’s comet, or by
the transformation of the orbit by Jupiter as in the case of Lexell’s comet.
Five, or, including Encke’s and Biela’s, seven, have periods commensur-
able with that of Jupiter; all have direct motion; all but one have a
smaller inclination than Pallas, and there is a tendency of the perihelia
to concentrate in the 180° (from 290° to 110°), as in the asteroids.

One of the most able of recent contributions to cometary astronomy
is a monograph by Dr. Kreutz upon the orbit of the great September
comet of 1882. In connection with investigations being carried on by
Professor Weiss this will form a complete discussion of the system of
comets with remarkably small perihelion distance, 1843 I, 1880 I, and
1882 II.

Dr. Galle is compiling a catalogue of recent comets embracing the
various supplements to the list given in 1847 in Encke’s edition of
*“ Olbers’ Methode.”

METEORITES.

Researches on meteorites.—Mr. Lockyer presented at the meeting of the
Royal Society on November 17, 1887, a paper giving the results of his
“ Researches on Meteorites,” which has attracted much attention. He
has examined meteoric spectra under various conditions, particularly
that of feeble temperature, and has found it possible to obtain from
meteorites spectra that show the most peculiar features of solar, stellar,
nebular, or cometary spectra. ‘In the spectra of nebulie, for instance,
seven lines have been detected, of which three were traced to hydrogen,
three to low-temperature magnesium, and the seventh, which has not
yet been traced to its originating element, has been given by the glow
from the Dhurmsala meteorite. The most characteristic nebular line
was identified with the low-temperature fluting of magnesium, and the
unusual spectrum obtained from the comets of 1866 and 1867 was
ascribed to the same cause. The changes observed in the speetrum of
the great comet of 1882 were such as would correspond to the changes
induced by the change of temperature in the spectrum of a meteorite ;
and the changes in the spectrum of Nova Cygni, and the bright lines in
such a star as R Geminorum received a similar explanation; while a
very full, in parts almost perfect, reproduction of a considerable portion
of the solar spectrum has been obtained by taking a composite photo-
graph of the are spectrum of several stony meteorites, taken at random
between iron meteoric poles. These and similar observations have led
Mr. Lockyer to regard all self-luminous bodies in the celestial spaces
ASTRONOMY. 155

as composed of meteorites, or masses of meteoritic vapor produced by
heat brought about by condensation of meteor-swarms due to gravity,
so that the existing distinction between stars, comets, and nebul:e rests
on no physical basis. All alike are meteoritic in origin, the differences
between them depending upon differences in temperature, and upon the
closeness of the component meteorites to one another. Nove (new stars
that blaze forth suddenly) are explained as produced by the elash of
meteor-streams, and most variable stars are regarded as uncondensed
meteor-streams. Stars with spectra like that of Alpha Orionis (Rigel)
are considered not as true suns, but as mere clouds of incandescent
stones; probably the first stage of meteoritic condensation. Stars with
spectra of the first and second type represent the condensed swarm in
its hottest stages, while spectra of Secchi’s fourth type indicate an ad-
vanced state of cooling.”

The general conclusions arrived at by Mr. Lockyer may be thus
summarized: All self-luminous bodies in space are composed of me-
teorites variously aggregated, and at various stages of temperature
depending upon the frequency and violence of their mutual collisions.
Comets, nebul, bright-line stars, stars showing banded spectra of the
third type, including most long-period variables, are to be regarded as
veritable meteor-swarms; they are made up, that is to say, of an in-
definite multitude of separate and (in a sense) independent solid bodies,
bathed in evolved gases, and glowing with the heat due to their ar-
rested motions. ‘The existing distinction,” we are told, “between
stars, comets, and nebul rests on no physical basis.” Stars, on the
other hand, of the Sirian and solar types (constituting the only true
“suns”) are vaporized meteor-swarms; their high temperatures repre-
sent the surrendered velocities of myriads of jostling particles, drawn
together by the victorious power of gravity.

“Collisions” are not however exclusively relied upon for the cos- °
mical production of light and heat. It is admitted that the luminosity
of comets and nebule must be largely due to electrical excitement;
nor is any reason apparent why its influence should be restricted to
these two classes of bodies. Destruction of movement by impacts ean
scarcely be made to supply its place. Occasional illuminative effects
may be derived from it, but none that are uniform and permanent.

The small bodies which, more or less plentifully distributed, appear
to pervade space, are in this theory treated as the fundamental atoms
of the universe. But it is evident that we can not begin there. They
have a history, marked perhaps by strange vicissitudes. They may be
agents of regeneration, but they are almost certainly products of de-
struction. Possibly they are seed as well as dust, and serve as the
material link between the creation and decay of successive generations
of suns. .

The orbits of meteorites.—Prof. H. A. Newton, of Yale College, has
carefully studied the evidence available for determining the “former
156 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

orbits of those meteorites that are in our collections and that were seen
to fall.” Of these stone-falls there are three classes: (a) 116 falls for
which we have statements as to the direction of the path through the
air; (b) 94 falls of which we know the time of day; (c) 50 or more falls
of which the history is too scanty to give the time of day. He is led
to the following three propositions:

1. The meteorites which we have in our cabinets, and which were
seen to fall, were originally (as a class and with a very small num-
ber of exceptions) moving about the sun in orbits that had inclinations
less than 90°; that is, their motions were direct, not retrograde.

2. The reason why we have only this class of stones in our collections
is not one wholly or even mainly dependent upon the habits of men;
nor on the times when men are out of doors; nor on the places where
men live; nor on any other principle of selection acting at or after the
arrival of the stones atthe ground. Hither the stones, which are mov-
ing in the solar system across the earth’s orbit, move in general in direct
orbits, or else for some reason the stones which move in retrograde
orbits do not in general come through the air in solid form.

3. The perihelion-distances of nearly all the orbits in which these
stones moved were not less than 0.5 nor more than 1.0, the earth’s
radius-vector being unity. (Observatory 11: 331.)

At the meeting of the Royal Society, November 15, 1888, Prof. G. TH.
Darwin read an important paper dealing with the mechanical conditions
of a swarm of meteorites from a mathematical stand-point.

SOLAR SYSTEM.

Motion of the solar system in space.—Dr. Ludwig Struve has made a
careful comparison of the Pulkowa catalogues for 1855 with Auwer’s
re-reduction of Bradley (epoch 1755), and, as one of his results, has ob-

SUN.

Rotation time of the sun.—Mr. Crew, of Johns Hopkins University,
has made a new determination of the time of revolution of the sun ou
its axis by comparing the wave-lengths of certain lines in the spectrum
when measured in light coming from two opposite limbs of the sun. By
Doppler’s principle the wave-length of the line in light from the ap-
proaching limb ought to be shorter than in the light from the receding
limb. The results obtained give a velocity of the photosphere at the
sun’s equator of 2.437 miles per second; from this the rotation time is
determined to be 25.88 days. Mr. Crew’s observations indicate an in-
crease in the angular velocity of the surface with increase in the helio-
graphic latitude. This result is opposed to that obtained by Carrington
and Spoerer from observations of sunspots.
158 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

Dr. Wilsing has found the rotation period from observations of faculze
to be 25.23, and has detected no variation in velocity depending upon
the latitude. The difficulty of identifying faculee on their reappearance,
and of measuring their positions with exactness, makes the result some-
what doubtful.

Diameter of the sun—Dr. Auwers has made a very exhaustive dis-
cussion of the sun’s horizontal and vertical diameters from the meridian
observations of Greenwich, Washington, Oxford and Neuchatel with
special reference to the alleged variations in the mean annual diameters
following the period of the sunspot cycie. He concludes that there is
no valid reason for supposing the sun’s diameter to vary, and that the
apparent changes arise from insufficiently determined personal equa-
tions. Healso points out that meridian observations are quite unsuited
for the determination of any possible ellipticity in the sun’s disk, and
that there is no reason to conclude from these results that such ellip-
ticity exists. The several mean values of the sun’s (assumed circular)
diameter are:

Wiashinotomeyas se soce eee Neuchatelre ccs... -2 02 13: ol.

The discordances are ascribed to instrumental or uneliminated per-
sonal peculiarities.

In a second paper Dr. Auwers discusses the apparent changes of both
the horizontal and vertical diameter during the course of a year, de-
duced from meridian observations, and he coneludes that the periodic
variations in the monthly value of the diameters result not from
physical changes in the sun, but from the effect of temperature on the
instruments and from difference in the quality of the telescopic images
at opposite seasons of the year.

Another discussion of the horizontal diameter of the sun has been
made by Professor di Legge from meridian transits of the sun observed
at Campidoglio from 1874 to 1883. The mean horizontal diameter at
mean distance deduced from 5796 transits by four observers on 2213
days is 32/ 2/38.

Solar activity in 1887, 1888.—The decrease in spots, faculze and promi-
nences which was so marked during 1886, and particularly during the
latter part of that year, continued in 1887, and although there was no
spotless period as long as that of November, 1886, the mean spotted
area for the year was much below that of the year preceding. The days
of greatest spotted area were July 6,7, and 8. The agreement in the
geueral form of the curves for spot numbers and magnetic variation
was not so close as in some previous years. The fluctuations in the num-
bers and dimensions of the prominerces were less than for the spots,
but they also showed a maximum in July. Facule accorded well with
the prominences, neither facule nor prominences following the spots in
the marked depression of November.
ASTRONOMY. 159

‘During 1888 spots were few, small and in low latitudes, and there
were frequent intervals in which no spots at all were seen, longer inter-
vals in fact than any since the minimum of 1879. The most prolific
month as to entire spotted area, though not as to number of spots, was
November, following immediately a long period of quiescence. There
was a rough tendency of spots to certain solar longitudes and in lati-
tude, they continued to be more numerous in the southern than in the
northern hemisphere. Facule did not vary simultaneously with spots,
but their diminution as compared with 1886 and 1887, was slight. They
showed a very noticeable development during the secondary maximum
of September, while the prominences fell off considerably both in Sep-
tember and November, but attained their greatest development in
March and April.

Solar spectrum.—Experiments made by Professor Trowbridge and
Mr. C. C. Hutchins at the Jefferson Physical Laboratory in Cambridge,
have overthrown the proof brought forward in 1879 by Dr. Henry Dra-
per of the existence of oxygen in the sun. They show that when suf.-
ficiently powerful apparatus is used to bring out minute details of the
spectrum of oxygen and of the sun, the bright regions of the solar spec-
trum disappear, and hence also the apparent coincidences between them
and the spectrum of oxygen upon which Dr. Draper based his proof.
The bright bands obtained by Dr. Draper are in fact occupied by num-
erous dark lines of variable intensity.

Continuing their experiments however they have been led to con-
clude that there is unmistakable evidence of the existence of carbon in
the sun.

In a valuable paper by Mr. C. C. Hutchins and Mr. E. L. Holden,
evidence is brought forward to show the probable existence in the sun
of bismuth, silver, and platinum, while tin potassium, and lithium are
more doubtful. For cadmium two perfect coincidences were found,
while there was no good evidence in favor of the presence of lead
cerium, molybdenum, uranium or vanadium.

Prof. S. P. Langley has published in the American Journal of Science
an abstract of a memoir on the invisible solar and lunar spectrum, in
which he summarizes the result of investigations carried on at the Al-
legheny Observatory in continuation of his previous researches on the
infra-red of the solar spectrum to the extent of about three microns.
By means of the improved apparatus described, the extreme infra-red
solar spectrum has now been searched from three to over eighteen mic-
rons; and it is shown that in this region the ratios between solar and
lunar heat are completely changed from what they are in the visible
spectrum. While the solar light in the latter is about five hundred
thousand times that of moonlight, the solar heat received in the invisi-
ble part of the spectrum is probably less than five hundred times the
lunar. These studies also promise important results for meteorology,
by opening to observation the hitherto unknown region of the spectrum,
160° -. RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

in which are to be found the nocturnal and diurnal radiations, not only
from the moon towards the earth, but from the soil of the earth towards
space. (Nature.)

Total eclipse of the sun, August 19, 1887.—Unusual preparations were
made throughout Kurope for observing this eclipse, and great popular
interest was manifested in the event, but, unfortunately, very few ob-
servations of value were obtained on account of the generally cloudy
weather that prevailed over the whole region west of the Ural moun-
tains. The central line of the eclipse first struck the earth at a point
53 miles west-northwest of Leipsic, where the sun was just rising. The
line of totality, which was about 135 miles wide, then crossed Germany,
Russia, Siberia, China and Japan, and left the earth at a point in the
Pacific Ocean in latitude 24° 27’ north, longitude 173° 30’ east.

Eclipse of the moon, January 28, 1888.—The total eclipse of the moon
on January 28, 1888, presented an unusually favorable opportunity for
observing the occultations of a large number of faint stars, and, in
order to secure as many observations of these phenomena as possible,
Dr. Dollen, of Pulkowa, prepared and sent out to the principal observa-
tories in Eurepe and America, a list of the stars to be occulted at each.
He reports that he has reveived three hundred and ninety-six observa-
tions of disappearances and three hundred and eighty-seven of re-ap-
pearances, the places of observation being so favorably situated, that
he considers that there is ample material for determining the position,
the diameter, and possibly the ellipticity and parallax of the moon.

SOLAR PARALLAX AND THE TRANSITS OF VENUS.

Professor Harkness, at the meeting of the American Association in
Cleveland on August 20,1888, gave a description of the instruments
and reduction processes employed by the United States Transit of
Venus Commission in determining the solar parallax from the measure-
ment of photographs taken at the ten American stations in December,
1882; Washington, Cedar Keys, San Antonio, Cerro Roblero, Prince-
ton, and the Lick Observatory, in the United States; Santa Cruz and
Santiago, South America; Wellington, South Africa, and Auckland,
New Zealand. The preliminary value of the parallax deduced from the
measured distances of the centres of the sun and of Venus on 1,475
photographs is z=8”.84740".012. The American photographs in 1874
gave z=8".883+ 0.034, and the French z=8”.80. The distance of the
sun corresponding to the value now obtained—8”.847—is 92,385,000
miles, with a probable error of only 125,000 miles. These numbers are
doubtless close approximations to the results which will be obtained
from the complete discussion of all the photographs, but they cannot
be regarded as final for several reasons, chief among which is the fact
that the reduction of the position angles of Venus relatively to the
sun’s center is still unfinished.

The report of the committee appointed to superiutend the arrange-

ASTRONOMY. 161

ments for the expeditions sent out by the British Government to ob-
serve the transit of Venus in 1882 has been published. It consists
almost entirely of a discussion by Mr. Stone of the observations of con-
tact. Expeditions were sent from England to Jamaica, Barbadoes,
Bermuda, Cape of Good Hope, Madagascar, New Zealand, and Bris-
bane, Queensland, and the observers at all these stations were success-
ful, except at Brisbane, where the weather was cloudy. It will be
remembered that the English committee did not feel satisfied with
the photographic work in 1874, and for various reasons they deter-
mived in the second transit to put their reliance entirely upon contact
observations. From the observations of external contact at ingress
Mr. Stone obtains a parallax of 8,/’7404+0".122; from those of internal
contact at ingress, 8.823+0/.023; from those of internal contact at
egress, 87.8554 0.036, and from external contact at egress 8.9534
0.048. The most probable combined result he considers to be 8/.852+
0.024, which corresponds to a mean distance of 92,510,000+ miles
between the earth and sun, with an uncertainty of 250,000 miles.

The fourth volume of the report of the German Transit of Venus
Commission was published in 1887, under the editorship of Dr. Auwers.
It contains the observations in detail made with the heliometer by
various observers, both before and after the transits of 1874 and 1882,
for the purpose of determining the instrumental constants.

The report of the Brazilian expeditions has been printed in a quarto
volume of 700 pages. Three stations were occupied: St. Thomas, in
the Antilles; Olinda, Brazil; and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of
Magellan. The transit was observed by projecting the sun’s image
forined by an equatorial refractor of 6.3 inches aperture upon a screen
and noting the times of contact. The result given for the value of the
parallax from the internal contacts is 8/’.808.

Professor Hall, using a value of the coustant of aberration 20/.4542,
deduced from a series of observatious of a Lyrae, made at the U.S.
Naval Observatory during the years 1862 to 1£67, and introducing
Michelson and Newcomb’s determination of the velocity of light, has
found for the solar parallax 8/”.810 + 0.0062.

PLANETS.

MArs.—The observations of Perrotin, Terby, and Denning have con-
firmed the presence of most of the so-called ‘‘ canals,” or narrow, dark
lines, that were discovered by Schiaparelli in 1877, and at subsequent
oppositions, and in some cases the gemination or doubling of the canals
has been detected.

Considerable interest has been aroused in regard to Mars on account
of the recent changes reported in the markings upon its surface by
Perrotin and others. The chief change reported was the apparent in-
undation or disappearance of the “ triangular contiuent,” to which the
name of Libya has been assigned, but che report has not beea confirmed

by the observations of Schiaparelli, Terby, Niesten, and Holden. The
observations of Professor Holden and his assistants with the 36 inch
refractor began on July 16, 18388, and were continued to August 10;
‘the planet was therefore very unfavorably situated, its diameter being
less than 9’. Several of the most important canals were seen, but they
were not double, appearing rather “as broad bands covering the spaces
on M. Sehiaparelli’s map which are occupied by pairs of canals and by
the spaces separating the members of each pair.” Professor Hall, with
the Washington 26-inch refractor, has never been able to see these
markings so sharply drawn by European observers. ‘The only remark-
avle change he noticed was the diminution in the size of the white spot
at the south pole of the planet.

Numerous sketches of Mars showing the canals or other markings
have been published by Holden, Perrotin, Terby, and Niesten. No ad-
equate explanation of the canals, or of the changes observed, has yet
been offered.

J UPITER’S SATELLITES.—Astronomers have always been puzzled by
the discordant appearances of the satellites during transit, but more
especially by the fact that the phenomena do not apply equally to all the
satellites, or even in some instances to the same satellite in two succes-
sive revolutions. The fourth, for instance, as it approaches the disk of
Jupiter becomes rapidly fainter till it arrives at contact. When once
on the limb it shines with a moderate brillianey for about ten or fifteen
minutes, then becomes suddenly lost to view for a similar period, and
lastly reappears, but as a dark spot, which grows datker and darker
until it equals the blackness of its own shadow on the planet. The ap-
pearance of the second satellite, however, is entirely different, for it
seems never to have been seen otherwise than pure white during transit;
whereas the first and third differ yet again from the preceding two.
The former is sometimes a steel-gray, and at others a little darker,
whereas the latter has been seen perfectly white and yet so black as to
be mistaken for the fourth. Mr. KE. J. Spitta has made a careful investi-
gation of these interesting phenomena, communicating his results in a
paper of some Jength, read at the meeting of the Royal Astronomical
Society, in November, 1887. His experiments consisted essentially of
numerous observations upon suitably prepared models representing the
planet and satellites, and he concludes (see Nature 37:468, March 15,
1888) that the probable reason the fourth satellite is uniformly black
during transit, when it has passed its period of disappearance, is, that
its albedo is so low as to grant the difference between it and the back-
ground necessary for a body to appear black when superimposed on an-
other. Its preliminary whiteness and disappearance are also shown to
be a question of relative albedo, for they are due to the fact that asphere
at its limb loses so much in reflective power that up to that moment
the satellite possesses sufficient albedo (as compared with the back-
ground in that situation) to maintain its whiteness, So, too, with the sec-
ASTRONOMY. 163

ond satellite. Its albedo proves to be so high that it is capable of pre-
serving its brillianey throughout the entire transit.

The third and first satellites evidently possess sides of different al-
bedo, one high enough to maintain a brighter aspect than the other, or
even, as in the case of the third, to make it appear white when one side
is presented to the earth and dark when the other. Finally, to quote
from the original paper, “it is not unreasonable to conelude that these
anomalous phenomena are due to functional idiosyncrasies in the eye
itself, rather than to physical peculiarities of the Jovian system.”

Mr. Denning has obtained from observations of the red spot made
between February 12 and August 22, 1888, a rotation of 9° 55™ 408.24,
nearly one second less than the spot gave in 1885-86, though six sec-
onds greater than in 1879.

The value obtained for the mass of Jupiter by von Haerdtl in his dis-
cussion of Winnecke’s comet is 1: 1047.152 + 0.0136.

SATURN.—-The first number of a new series of publications called
Supplements to the Pulkowa Observations contains an interesting me-
moir by Dr. Hermann Struve on the outer satellites of Saturn. He dis-
cusses his own observations made with the 15-inch refractor in the
years 1884-1886 on Iapetus, Titan, Rhea, and Dione, with a view to
correcting the elements of these satellites, and also the values of the
mass and ellipticity of Saturn. The mass of Saturn was found by Bes-
sel to be 1 : 3501.64 0.77, or with a slight correction indicated in the pres-
ent paper, 1: 3502.5. Prof. Asaph Hall, on the other hand, obtained the
value 1: 3481.3+0.54. Struve considers the rather large discordance be-
tween these values due to systematic error in measuring the distance
of a satellite from a limb, and his own observations consist entirely of
comparisons of one satellite with another, either by differences of right
ascension and north polar distance or of distance and position angle.
His resulting value of the mass of Saturn agrees closely with Bessel’s,
being 1: 3498. The correction of the elements has been carefully and
laboriously carried out by the method of least squares. (The Observa-
tory, 11: 303, July, 1888.)

Mr. G. W. Hill,in his paper on the motion of Hyperion and the mass
of Titan, has obtained for the latter 1: 4714, Saturn’s mass being unity.
Newcomb’s corrected value, and Ormond Stone’s value, accord well with
this.

URANvs.—Dr. Valentiner, of the Karlsruhe Observatory, and his as-
sistant, Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz, were able to detect in April, 1857, a
slight ellipticity in the disk of the plavet Uranus, but their instrument,
a 6-inch equatorial, was not of sufficient power to make satisfactory
measures.

NEP1 UNE.—Tisserand has shown that the progressive changes in the
node and inclination of the orbit of the satellite of Neptune can be ex-
plained by supposing a slight flattening of the surface of the planet;
but the flattening would probably be too slight to be measured, Fur-
164 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888,

ther observations may enable the amount of the inclination to be more
exactly determined, and at the same time will show whether the changes
in question are due to this cause alone.

THE MINOR PLANETS.—Seventeen of these small bodies were added
to the group during the years 1887 and 1888, making the total number
now known 281.

The new discoveries, with approximate elements, are given in the
following table. All except number 270 were below the eleventh mag-
nitude, and some slight confusion at first occurred in the numbering,
owing to the difficulty of distinguishing a new asteroid from one
already known in the absence of a very carefully computed ephemeris.
For instance, numbers 268 and 279 were at first thought to be identical
with 149, Medusa; 277 with 228, Agathe; 280 with 255, Oppavia; while
an asteroid detected by Luther on April 11, 1887, and independently by
Coggia on April 16, proved to be 69, Hesperia, which had been looked
for in vain in 1882 and 1885; and one found by Borelly on May 12, 1888,
to which the number 278 was assigned, though it was suspected to be
identical with 156, Xanthippe, eventually proved to be 116, Sirona.

Number 265 is remarkable on account of the very considerable in-
clination of the plane of its orbit to that of the ecliptic, and also on
account of its near approach to the earth, its least distance from us
ASTRONOMY. 165

being 0.96, in terms of the earth’s mean distance from the sun; if
would therefore seem to offer an additional means of determining the
value of the solar parallax. Number 270 also approaches quite near
the earth, A=0.81. It will be noticed that 279, with its mean distance
from the sun of 4.25, considerably greater than that of any other aste-
roid, lies upon the extreme outer limit of the group, and will at certain
times, therefore, be brought quite close to Jupiter, and by the pertur-
bations thus experienced may furnish further knowledge of the mass
of that planet. Number 281, with its small mean distance of 2.19 lies,
on the other hand, near the inner border of the group; it is the sixty-
eighth asteroid discovered by Dr. J. Palisa.

_ Prof. Tietjen discontinues with the year 1888, the regular issue of the
Cireulars and Correspondence of the Berlin Jahrbuch, relating to as.

discovered planets presenting interesting peculiarities.

The Annals of the Harvard Observatory, volume 18, No. 3, contains a
discussion of a series of photometric observations of the asteroids by
Mr. H. M. Parkhurst, extending from April to December, 1887. The
method of observation was to note the time that the asteroid took to
disappear after passing a transit wire, the telescope being stationary,
and the light of the asteroid or comparison star suffering diminution
either by a wedge or more frequently by a deflector—a piece of glass
with nearly parallel sides placed in the telescope tube, about one-sev-
enth of the way from the focus to the object glass, and covering half
the field. The conclusions reached by the author are as follows:

(1) The phase correction can not be neglected, and is peculiar to each
asteroid.

(2) There may be, for certain asteroids, large errors from rotation.

(3) In most eases, after the phase correction has been determined, the
remaining unknown errors are less than the average variation of the
fixed stars.

REPORTS OF OBSERVATORIES.

In collecting the following notes upon observatories the latest avail-
able information has been utilized, but it has been found impossible to
biing the report in each case down to the end of 1888. The Viertel-
jahrsschrift, for instance, from which the data for many European ob
servatories are drawn, contains reports no later than 1887, and compar
atively few observatories publish independent annual reports. The
writer’s thanks are due to Sr. Felipe Valle for notes on the observatories
of Mexico.

Ann Arbor.—Prof. W. W. Campbell has been appointed assistant to
fill the vacancy made by the removal of Mr. Schaeberle to the Lick Ob-
servatory.

Armagh.—Dr. Dreyer has devoted a large part of his time to the pre-
paration and passing through the press of a new general catalogue of
nebule.

Bamberg.—An interesting description of the new observatory is given
in the Vierteljahrssehrift for 1887, p. 333, by the direetor, Dr. E. Hart-
wig. The sum of $45,000 was available for buildings, $17,500 for in-
strnments, the interest on $20,000 for salaries, and on $12,500 for main-
tenance, with a reserve fund of about $20,000. The observatory con-
sists of two buildings, the observing-rooms being in one and the offices
and dwelling in the other. In the first there are two towers surmounted
by domes and connecting them is the transit room. <A long covered
way from the dwelling gives easy access to the instruments. . The latter
are a 7-inch Repsold-Merz heliometer similar to the one at the Cape, a
10 ineh refractor, a Repsold-Merz transit with zenith-telescope attach-
ment, 6-inch Merz comet-seeker, clocks, chronometers, and subsidiary
apparatus.

Basel (1886).—The astronomical observatory and meteorological sta-
tion are under the direction of Dr. E. Hagenbach- Bischoff, assisted by
Dr. Riggenbach. The instruments are used principally for the deter
mination of time and for the instruction of students.

Beloit.—The equipment of the Smith Observatory, Beloit College,
which was built in 1883 and ready for work in 1884, consists of an
equatorial refractor of 94 inches aperture, objective by Clark, mount-
ing by Warner and Swasey; a combined transit and zenith telescope
of 2.6 inches aperture, made by Prof. C. S. Lyman (see Amer. Jour. Se.,
XXX, p. 52); clocks, sidereal chronometer, chronograph and minor ap-
paratus, and meteorological and photographie outfit. Directors: John
Tatlock, jr., 188485; C. A. Bacon, 1885. A local time service is main-
tained, and meteorological observations are published daily.

Berkeley, California.—The “Students’” observatory of the University
of California, established in 1887, is designed to furnish to under grad-
uates instruction in geodesy and the more practical parts of astronomy
generally; as rating clocks and chronometers, determining geographical
ASTRONOMY. 167

latitudes and longitudes, etc. It is also designed to encourage study,
on the part of the more advanced under-graduates, of astronomical
phenomena, as far as they may be within the reach of young amateurs.

A neat and sufficiently commodious observatory building, 50 feet long
by 20 feet wide, on the average, has been built on a knoll in the univer-
sity grounds 320 feet above mean sea-level. In the dome-room, at the
east end of the observatory, is an equatorial refractor of 64 inches clear
aperture, objective (achromatic), by J. Byrn, of New York, the mount-
ing, driving-clock, pier, etc., being by Fauth & Co., of Washington.
With this telescope are six negative and as many more positive eye-
pieces, and a fine position filar micrometer made by the same firm. A
spectroscope, capable of attachment to the equatorial or of being used
on a stand, is furnished with a flint prism, and also with one of Row-
lands diffraction gratings, having 14,334 lines to the inch.

In the room next west are two of J. Green’s standard barometers, and
in a. specially prepared shed upon the north side, a wet bulb, adry bulb,
a maximum, and also a minimum thermometer, by H.J. Green, of New
York. In this shed is also placed one of Draper’s self-registering ‘‘ ther-
mographs.”

On the northwest tower of the College of Letters are mounted a Rob-
inson anemometer and a wind-vane. These instruments are connected
by telegraph wires with an anemograph in the observatory, where the
velocity and direction of the wind are automatically recorded. Meteor-
ological observations and records are made at 7 A. M., 2 P. M., and 9 P.
M. (Standard or mean time of the 120th meridian of longitude). Monthly
printed reports are made to the U.S. Signal Service office in San Fran-
cisco.

In the next room west is mounted a fine, large, portable * transit and
zenith telescope,” of the type used by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic
Survey, but having an objective 3 inches in diameter.

Two diagonal and two direct eye-pieces belong to this instrument.
In the same room is a Howard Standard mean time clock, with grav-
ity escapement, mercurial compensating pendulum, and electric circuit
connections. The clock is fastened to a solid granite pier 15 inches
square and 6 feet long, which is inclosed ina brick pier reaching to solid
rock 5 feet below the surface of the ground. The transit and equatorial
‘are similarly founded. All the piers are disconnected from the floors of
the observatory. A sidereal chronometer, made by Negus Bros., New
York, is mounted upon one side of the transit pier.

On a shelf at one side of the transit-room is an electro-chronograph,
by Fauth & Co., of Washington, and on another the switch-board made
by the San Francisco Electric Company. An electric circuit runs
through the clock, chronometer, chronograph, sounder, and relay, and
also into the equatorial-room, from which time may be marked on the
chronograph by means of a break-circuit key. .The switch-board is con-
nected with the Western Union telegraph line by a shortline to Dwight
Way-Station, Berkeley.
168 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

The tworooms further west are used respectively as a repair shop and
a sleeping-room for the assistant.

In a small house at the rear of the observatory, upon a brick pier spe-
cially made for the purpose, are mounted three seismographs, the Du-
plex, the Ewing rotating, and the Gray.

The latitude of the mereury basin in the center of the transit pier of
the observatory has been found from the first series of observations (pre-
liminary to a continued series) to be + 37° 52/ 21.7. Longitude west
of Greenwich 8" 9™ 28,52.

The observatory is in charge of Prof. Frank Soulé, professor of civil
engineering and astronomy, University of California.

Berlin.—The principal work of the meridian circle has been upon the
Pulkowa list of stars and Argelander’s stars, with considerable proper
motion; a few comparison stars were observed, and preliminary experi-
ments made to determine the influence of brightness of stars upon the
observed time of transit. The 9-inch equatorial has been employed upon
comets, asteroids, and comparison stars, and the declinograph attached
to this instrument in observing zones in the thicker parts of the milky-
way. With the smaller meridian instrument a series of observations of
comparison stars has been begun, and with the heliometer measures of
double stars and the Pleiades. In the annual reports of this observa-
tory, given by Professor Foerster in the Vierteljahrsschrift, will be found
interesting notes upon the performance of the clocks and time service.

The Recheninstitut, under Professor Tietjen, has published, as usual,
the Jahrbuch, and circulars relating to the minor planets.

Bonn.—Dr. Schoenfeld reports satisfactory progress of the observa-
tions and reductions of zone +40° to +50°. The remaining charts of
the Southern Durchmusterung have been completed and distributed,
and an investigation of errors in star catalogues -covered by these
charts is approaching completion. A few observations of variables
have been made. Dr, Ménnichmeyer succeeded Dr. Scheiner as assist-
ant on January 1, 1887, the latter having accepted a position at Pots-
dam.

Bordeaux.—The second volume of Annales, published in 1887, con-
tains a memoir by Flamme upon elliptic motion of the planets, a deter-
mination of the latitude by Rayet, and a series of observations made
with the meridian circle for a revision of Oeltzen’s catalogue of Argel-
ander’s southern stars; also magnetic and meteorological observations.

sreslau.—Observations mainly meteorological and magnetic, and for
the time service.

Brighton (Massachusetts) —Mr. E. F. Sawyer, of Cambridgeport, has
removed to Brighton, upon the outskirts of Boston, and continues his
observations of variables.

Brooklyn (New York).—Mr. H. M. Parkhurst’s private observatory
was originally built in 1862 and provided with a 6-inch telescope. It
was rebuilt in 1877 and a 9-inch refractor was mounted. A series of
ASTRONOMY. 169

photometrie observations made by Mr. Parkhust has been published
in the Harvard Observatory Annals, vol. 18, No. 3.0 Approximate
position, latitude, +40° 41’ 2”; longitude, 4" 55™ 508.1 west of Green-
wich.

Brussels.—A catalogue of 10,792 stars upon which work was begun
more than thirty years ago by Quetelet has at length been finished.
M. Stuyvaert is engaged upon the formation of a catalogue of compari-
son-stars, which have appeared in volumes 107 and 108 of the Astrono-
mische Nachrichten. Double stars, comets, and occultations by the
moon have been observed with the equatorials of 38 and 15 centimeters,
and numerous physical observations of the moon and planets have also
been made. M. labbé Spée is especially occupied with a study of solar
spots and protuberances, and M. Fievez with the study of the solar
spectrum. The new observatory at Uccle is practically finished.

Cambridge (England).—Considerable progress has been made with the
zone +25° to +30°.

Camden (New Jersey).—Mr. E. BE. Reed has erected a small private
observatory, with 6-inch equatorial.

Cape of Good Hope—With the transit-circle regular observations
have been continued of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, stars on the list of
the Cape ten-year catalogue for 1890, comet comparison stars, stars
occulted by the Moon, stars employed in the latitude and longitude
determinations of the Geodetic Survey, and stars employed in zones
for determining the scale value of the heliometer. The large theodolite
has been used for observations of circumpolars and latitude stars, the
zenith telescope for latitude, and the equatorial for observations +of
comets. The photographic ‘‘Durchmusterung” is proceeding rapidly,
the instrument being kept at work by two observers from evening
twilight till dawn. The reduction of the plates from declination —90°
to —774° has been completed by Professor Kapteyn, and plates for
measurement to —57° have been sent to him. It is expected that the
photographs will be completed by the end of 1889; tieir reduction
will probably require two years longer. The new heliometer was re-
ceived from Repsold, and mounted in the latter part of 1887; it is
pronounced by Dr. Gill the most powerful and convenient instrument
for refined micrometric research at present in existence. A complete
working programme has been prepared, including the determination of
the parallax of all the southern stars brighter than magnitude 2.0 and
all the stars most remarkable for proper motion. Some progress has
been made in the determination of the constants of the instrument.
The meridian observations for 1882, 1883, and 1884, occultations ob-
served from 1835 to 1880, forming vol. 1, part 4 of the Annals, and a
discussion of the variations of the instrumental adjustments of the
transit-circle have been published.

Carleton College.—An illustrated description of the building and in-
struments is given in the Sidereal Messenger for October, 1888, The
170 RECORD OF SCIENCE FOR 1887 AND 1888.

length of the building east and west is 80 feet, north and south 106
feet. The clock-room is on the first floor of the main building, and is
27 feet in diameter. The large circular pier for the 16-inch equatorial
(to be constructed by Brashear) is in the middle of this room, suttably
cased to a height of 74 feet, and provided with shelving. The mean-
time and sidereal clocks, both by Howard, are mounted in recesses in
the east and west faces of this pier. In the west wing, upon the same
floor, is the library with about 1,400 bound volumes, a small study or
class-room, and a janitor’s room; to the north is the prime vertical of
3-inch aperture (Fauth), and beyond this a class and lecture room. A
small dome over the north wing covers the 8} inch Clark refractor. In
the east wing is mounted a fine Repsold meridian circle of 4.8 inches
aperture, which is under the charge of Dr. H. C. Wilson. The chrono-
graph, chronometer, and time-distributing apparatus are in the clock-
room, <A time-service over more than 12,000 miles of railway is under
the immediate care of Miss C. R. Willard.

The co-ordinates of the observatory provisionally adopted are (Astron.
Nachr. 120:85): latitude +44° 27/ 41”; longitude 6" 12™ 368.0 west of
Greenwich. ;

Cincinnati.—A zone catalogue of 4,050 stars observed with the 3-ineh
transit was published in 1887. In September, 1888, a new meridian cir-
cle, by Fauth & Co., was mounted, one of the first large instruments of
this class made in the United States. The clear aperture of the object-
glass is 51 inches, and the focal length 70 inches; object-glass and mi-
crometer are inter-changeable. The piers are of masonry to the floor-
level, and from there up an iron frame work bricked inside to within a
foot of the top. The pivots are of steel, glass hard. There are two solid
circles, 24 inches in diameter; one is divided very coarsely to half de-
grees only: the other has two sets of graduation upon a silver band,
both of them to 5’. The inner one is somewhat heavier than the other,
and does not pretend to great accuracy, being used merely for setting.
The outer graduation alone is visible in the reading miscroscopes; as far
as Professor Porter has carried his investigation the errors of this grad-
uation are very small. Electric illumination has been used throughout
and has been found practically perfect. A detailed description of the
instrument will be found in the Sidereal Messenger for January, 1889.

Cointe ( Liége).—Observations of Titan and Japetus have furnished a
determination of the mass of Saturn. The meridian circle has been used
for zone observations.

Copenhagen.—Mr. Nielsen has recently erected a private observatory
with a 65 inch refractor by Reinfelder & Hertel, intended principally
for selenographical work.

Cordoba.—V olumes 6 and 9, containing the zone observations made in
1875 and 1876, have been published.

Dearborn.—The report for 1885 and 1886, which has not previously
been noticed, contains a list of nebula discovered by Professor Safford
ASTRONOMY. nA

in 1866~68; papers on the motion of the lunar apsides and on the com-
panion of Sirius by Professor Colbert; and an illustrated paper on the
physical aspect of Jupiter, a catalogue of 209 new double stars, and a
description of a printing chronograph by Professor Hough. In the
course of the two years referred to 130 new double stars were discov-
ered and measured.

In consequence of the dissolution of the University of Chieago the
Chicago Astronomical Society dismounted their instruments in the
early part of 1888, and transferred the care of the observatory to the
Northwestern University, at Evanston, Illinois, 12 miles from the busi-
ness center of Chicago, about 16 miles north and 3 miles west of the old
site, and some 300 feet from the shore of Lake Michigan. The corner
stone of a new building, the gift of James B. Hobbs, was laid June 24,
1888. The plan includes a tower and dome for the 184-inch equatorial,
meridian circle room, library, and about eight rooms for other purposes;
the whole to be erected at a cost of $25,000. The approximate position
is given: Latitude, +42° 3’; longitude, 5" 50™ 428 west of Greenwich.

Denver.—A. new observatory, the gift of Mr. H. B. Chamberlin to the
University of Denver, is being built, about 7 miles from the city of
Denver, at an altitude of 5,000 feet above sea-level. The principal
jostrument is to be a 20-inch Clark refractor. Director, Prof. H. A.
Howe.

Dresden.—Baron von Engelhardt’s older observatory was built in
1877? (latitude, +51° 2/31; longitude, 0" 54™ 538.3 east of Greenwich),
and contained an 8-inch Grubb equatorial, a 2-inch Cooke transit, and a
sidereal clock by Knoblich. The present observatory was built in 1879
somewhat nearer the outskirts of Dresden (latitude, +-51° 2’ 19’; longi-
tude, 0" 54” 548.7 east of Greenwich). It consists of a three-story tower,
the upper story being surmounted by a cylindrical ‘‘ dome” covering a
12-inch Grubb equatorial. The second floor connects with the transit-
room, in which is a “ broken-back” transit, by Bamberg, of 2.7 inches
aperture. There is also a very complete equipment of subsidiary appa-
ratus, clocks, chronometers, chronograph, etc. Upon the adjoining roof
of the baron’s residence is a little comet observatory arranged for two
instruments, one of 6.4 inches aperture and the other of 3.7 inches. The
larger instrument, which is similar to the Strassburg comet-seeker, is
of somewhat novel construction. The telescope is fastened by two long
aris to the back of a chair so that the eye-end comes at a convenient
position for the observer; the arms are pivoted to the chair-back, per-
mitting a motion in altitude, while the chair may be rotated in azimuth,
so that the astronomer can examine the whole sky rapidly and without
fatigue.

The numerous and valuable observations of occultations, phenomena
of Jupiter’s satellites, comets, planets, new stars, nebulae, and clusters
were collected and published in the latter part of 1886, together with an
illustrated description of the observatory and instruments. Similar ob-

servations have been continued during the past two years, and consider-
able progress has also been made with a series of micrometrie measures
of all stars in Bradley and Argelander, which have an annual proper
motion of at least 0.1, with companions not below the tenth magnitude,
and distance not greater than 3’.

Dresden (K. math. Salon).—Meteorological observations and a local
time-service.

Dunecht.—Spectroscopie work has consisted of measures upon stars
and nebule and a study of the low-sun atmospheric lines, as seen from
an observing station established upon a neighboring hill. Circulars of
astronomical information, the weekly firing of the time-gun, and the
dailf meteorological observations have been continted as in former
years. A catalogue of the library is in press.

Dunsink.—The meridian circle has been devoted to observations of a
list of about 1,000 stars suspected of large proper motion. Part vt of
“Observations” was issued in 1888, containing the observations from
1881 to 1885 made with the meridian circle on 1,012 stars of the south-
ern Durchmusterung requiring re-observation.

Diisseldorf.—Observations of comets and asteroids and ephemerides
of the latter.

Ealing.—Mr. Common has completed his ist foot reflector.

Edinburgh.—Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth resigned in August, 1888, the ap-
pointments (which he has held since 1846) of regius professor of prac-
tical astronomy in the University of Edinburgh and astronomer Yoyal
for Ireland, and he has given a very discouraging account of the finan-
cial condition of the institution. Dr. Ralph Copeland, of the Dun Keht
Observatory, has been appointed as his successor.

Geneva.—In addition to the regular work of rating chronometers and
watches, observations have been made of comets, of nebule, and of the
rings of Saturn. <A series of observations made by Plantamour and
von Oppolzer, in 1881, for the purpose of determining the difference of
