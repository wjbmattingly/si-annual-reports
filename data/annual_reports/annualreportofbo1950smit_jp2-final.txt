REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

ALEXANDER WETMORE

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1950

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report
showing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution
and its branches during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1950.

GENERAL STATEMENT

The activities of the Smithsonian Institution, now as when it was
established more than a century ago, are geared to the broad purposes
stated by the founder, James Smithson. He wanted, he said in his
famous will, “‘to found at Washington an institution for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.’”’ These words have had a
far-reaching effect on American science, for they not only enabled the
Institution to operate without excessive restrictions and with freedom
of initiative and outlook, but also they became the pattern for other
foundations established during the course of the nineteenth century.

In this day of increasing pressures on all sides and definite trends
in certain countries toward the regimentation of science, the necessity
for this freedom of inquiry under which the Smithsonian has existed
cannot be too strongly emphasized.

The Institution has never sought to expand its programs inordi-
nately, or to add functions unjustified by normal demands or neces-
sities. It has been conservative, yet pioneering, and it would not be
difficult to cite instances where small and perhaps unpopular projects,
modestly aided by Smithsonian encouragement or financial grants,
developed into enterprises of considerable scope and importance.
When the Institution began its operations in 1846, it carried on its
research programs largely by subsidizing the work of scientists not
on its own staff and by publishing the results of their work. As these
pioneer researches expanded and became somewhat stabilized,
bureaus gradually grew up around the Institution, each with its own
staff specializing in the work of that particular field. The value of
the various activities gradually became known to the Nation, and
eventually one by one they were recognized as public necessities by

1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

the Congress. Most of them are now supported largely by Govern-
ment funds although remaining under Smithsonian direction. At
present, nearly all the research and exploration of the Institution is
done through these bureaus, notably the United States National
Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Astrophysical
Observatory.

Unfortunately, the governmental support of the branches of the
Institution, now ten in number, has not kept pace with even the
normal exigencies of modern times. The greatest deficiency at the
present time is in the physical plant and facilities. As I have pointed
out in previous reports, the problem of housing the constantly increas-
ing collections of the National Museum is so critical that important
material must be refused because there is no space to store it, to say
nothing of exhibiting it. The Natural History Building at Constitu-
tion Avenue and Tenth Street and the 80-year-old Arts and Industries
Building to the south are so crowded that the task of accommodating
new accessions becomes a juggling game. Alleviation of these condi-
tions awaits the time when Congress appropriates funds for the new
buildings we have under consideration.

Throughout the period of the two world wars and the intervening
“depression,” many of our museum exhibits, though adequate enough
in their day, became badly out of date and in need of drastic renova-
tion. During the past 2 or 3 years it has been possible to begin the
job of modernizing these exhibits, and the work will go forward as
rapidly as funds for the purpose become available. This is a large
and time-consuming undertaking, but one that is vital to the Institu-
tion’s educational program. During the past year more than 2,600,000
persons visited the Smithsonian group of buildings. It is our obliga-
tion, so far as our funds and facilities permit, to extend to this large
cross section of the public (many of whom are students) all possible
courtesies and assistance and to make their visits stimulating and
rewarding.

For the most part the year saw few major changes in the Institu-
tion’s staff. In many departments shortages of personnel continue
to exist, a situation that can be remedied only as rapidly as new posi-
tions are provided for by budgetary and congressional authorization.
On May 31, 1950, Webster Prentiss True retired as chief of the edi-
torial division after nearly 36 years with the Institution and was
succeeded in that position on June 1 by Paul H. Oehser, assistant
chief of the division and editor of the National Museum. Dr. Leland
O. Howard, veteran entomologist and honorary curator of insects of
the National Museum, died on May 1, 1950; Dr. Henri Pittier, associ-
ate in botany, on January 27, 1950,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 3

THE ESTABLISH MENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of England,
who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America
“to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust,
Congress determined that the Federal Government was without
authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted
an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the President,
the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

No changes occurred in the personnel of the Board of Regents
during the year. There still exists one vacancy in the class of citizen
regents.

The roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1950, was
as follows: Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Chancellor; Vice President
Alben W. Barkley; members from the Senate: Walter F. George,
Clinton P. Anderson, Leverett Saltonstall; members from the House
of Representatives: Clarence Cannon, John M. Vorys, E. E. Cox;
citizen members: Harvey N. Davis, Arthur H. Compton, Vannevar
Bush, Robert V. Fleming, and Jerome C. Hunsaker.

Proceedings —The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was
held on January 13, 1950. Present: Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson,
Chancellor; Representative Clarence Cannon, Representative John
M. Vorys; Senator Clinton P. Anderson; Dr. Robert V. Fleming,
Dr. Vannevar Bush, Dr. Jerome C. Hunsaker, Secretary Alexander
Wetmore, and Assistant Secretary John E. Graf.

The Secretary presented his annual report covering the activities
of the Institution and its bureaus, including the financial report of
the Executive Committee, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1949,
which was accepted by the Board. The usual resolution authorized
the expenditure by the Secretary of the income of the Institution for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1951.

The Secretary reported that in connection with surveys for con-
struction of Government dams throughout the country there has
been much interest in the salvage of scientific materials that would
be covered by impounded waters. In connection with this, Congress-
man Curtis of Nebraska introduced in the House a bill, H. R. 2290,
to provide for cooperatjon by the Smithsonian Institution with State,
educational, and scientific organizations for fossil studies in areas to
be flooded by the construction of Government dams. This bill,
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

including an authorization for an appropriation of $65,000, passed
the House and the Senate and was approved by the President on
August 15, 1949.

The Board was advised that Congress had recently requested the
Bureau of the Budget to contact all Federal agencies that were carry-
ing on activities with the aid of Federal appropriations without having
clear-cut basic authority therefor to advise them to submit drafts of
bills proposing the requisite authorizations. In accordance with this,
a draft of legislation was prepared to cover the activities of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, the Astrophysical Observatory, and certain
miscellaneous housekeeping functions that had been carried on for
many years but had not been clearly authorized by basic legislation.
The Bureau of American Ethnology was established in 1879 ‘for
the purpose of continuing ethnological researches among the North
American Indians under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,”
with annual appropriation for this purpose, but without formal
authorization other than that of the appropriation acts. The Astro-
physical Observatory was founded, in similar manner, in 1890, for
the measurement and analysis of solar radiation, and since 1891 has
received annual appropriations. Further, Congress has appropriated
funds since 1886 for the maintenance of Smithsonian buildings and
grounds, and since 1896 for the preparation of manuscripts, drawings,
and illustrations for publication. The Honorable Clarence Cannon,
regent, introduced H. R. 3417 on March 10, 1949, containing the
authorizations needed. This duly passed the House of Representa-
tives, and in the Senate the matter received the attention of Senator
Clinton P. Anderson, regent, and the friendly consideration of
Senator Carl Hayden, chairman of the Committee on Rules and
Administration, to the end that the act passed the Senate and on
August 22, 1949, was signed by the President. This places these
activities, some of which have been in operation for over 70 years,
on firm legal basis.

Developments concerning the Gellatly art collection since the
previous meeting of the Board were reported as follows by the Secre-
tary: At the annual meeting last year, it was reported that the action
of Mrs. Charlayne Whiteley Gellatly against the Secretary, in an
attempt to recover the Gellatly collection from the Secretary in his
status as a private individual though acting as custodian under the
Smithsonian Institution, had been carried to the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, following decision in
favor of the Secretary in the District Court of the United States for
the District of Columbia, Under date of September 28, 1949, the
United States Court of Appeals issued an order stating that the court,
having duly considered a petition for a rehearing, had denied the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 5

rehearing. The Institution was represented in this action by the
Department of Justice through Marvin C. Taylor, special attorney.

On the evening of January 12, 1950, an informal dinner meeting of
the Board was held in the Main Hall of the Smithsonian Institution,
with the Chancellor, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, presiding. This
occasion gave opportunity for members of the Smithsonian staff to
make a fuller presentation of the scientific work of the Institution
than was practicable at the regular meeting the next day.

FINANCES

A statement on finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian
private funds, will be found in the report of the Executive Committee
of the Board of Regents, page 156.

APPROPRIATIONS

Funds appropriated to the Institution for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1950, totaled $2,346,000, allotted as follows:

In addition $1,114,700 was appropriated to the National Gallery
of Art, a bureau of the Institution but administered by a separate
board of trustees; and $544,700 was provided in the District of
Columbia appropriation act for the operation of the National Zoo-
logical Park. !

Besides these direct appropriations, the Institution received funds
by transfer from other Federal agencies, as follows:

From the State Department, from the appropriation Cooperation
with the American Republics, 1950, a total of $82,510 for the opera-
tion of the Institute of Social Anthropology, including the issuance
of publications resulting from its work.

From the National Park Service, Department of the Interior,
$215,886 for archeological projects in connection with River Basin
Surveys.

VISITORS

Visitors to the Smithsonian buildings during the year totaled
2,600,758, only slightly less than last year’s all-time record of attend-
ance. March 1950 was the month of largest attendance, with 371,811
visitors; August 1949 was the next largest, with 349,318. A summary
of attendance records for the five buildings is given in table 1:

SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL JAMES ARTHUR LECTURE ON THE SUN

In 1931 the Institution received a bequest from James Arthur, of
New York, a part of the income from which was to be used for an
annual lecture on some aspect of the study of the sun.

The seventeenth Arthur lecture was delivered in the auditorium of
the Natural History Building on April 6, 1950, by Dr. Bertil Lindblad,
Director of the Stockholm Observatory, Stockholm, Sweden. The
subject of Dr. Lindblad’s address was ‘‘The Luminous Surface and
Atmosphere of the Sun.”’ His lecture is published in full in the Gen-
eral Appendix of the present Report of the Board of Regents (p. 173.)

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF THE
INSTITUTION

National Museum.—The national collections were increased during
the year by approximately 793,300 specimens, a large increase over
the previous year, bringing the total number of catalog entries in all
six departments to 32,375,597. Noteworthy accessions for the year
included: In anthropology, nearly a thousand pottery, stone, and
other objects from the Neolithic period of northern Honshu, Japan,
and a further lot of ethnological specimens obtained in northern
Australia by the 1948 expedition to Arnhem Land sponsored by the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 7

Commonwealth of Australia, the National Geographic Society, and
the Smithsonian Institution; in zoology, about 10,000 skins and over
400 skeletons of North American birds from one donor, 4,500 fishes
from the Gulf of Mexico, a collection of 15,000 British Microlepidop-
tera, a bequest of 10,500 beetles, and sizable lots of marine inverte-
brates from Arctic America; in botany, large collections of plants
from Peri, New Zealand, Colombia, and Africa; in geology, 24 kinds
of minerals hitherto unrepresented in the national collections, several
new meteorites, many thousand invertebrate fossils (including the
large and important Cushman and Vaughan collections of Forami-
nifera and the Renfro fossil-invertebrate collection of 250,000 speci-
mens), and skeletal remains of the giant ground sloth AMegatherium
from western Panam4; in engineering and industries, exhibition mate-
rial illustrating the operation of a textile-finishing mill and 51 ex-
amples of the work of the pioneering photographer Victor Prevost;
and in history, a silver-filigree basket reputed to have belonged to
Napoleon, two outstanding models of historic ships, and several
interesting philatelic and numismatic acquisitions,

Field work by members of the Museum staff or by collaborators was
conducted in Colombia, Guatemala, Panam&é, Alaska and the Arctic,
Africa, the West Indies, and many sections of the United States.
The Museum issued 29 publications.

National Gallery of Art.—Visitors to the Gallery during the year
reached a total of 2,187,293, a daily average attendance of 6,025
persons. This represented a daily increase of 1,800 over the previous
year’s record. Accessions as gifts, loans, or deposits numbered 2,354.
Ten special exhibitions were held at the Gallery, including a 2-month
showing of the celebrated ‘Art Treasures from the Vienna Collections,”
lent by the Austrian Government, and ‘Makers of History in Wash-
ington, 1800-1950,” an exhibit that opened on June 29, 1950, cele-
brating the sesquicentennial of the establishment of the Federal
Government in Washington. Special exhibitions of prints from the
Rosenwald collection were circulated to seven galleries and museums
in this country and Canada, and exhibitions from the ‘Index of
American Design’? were shown at 34 institutions in 17 States, the
District of Columbia, and London, England. Over 20,000 photo-
graphs were acquired from European museums and are being cataloged
and filed. ‘The staff continued to answer hundreds of inquiries and
to give opinion on works of art brought to the Gallery and advice on
research problems in art. The volume ‘Masterpieces of Sculpture
from the National Gallery of Art,” by Charles Seymour, Jr., was
placed on sale during the year, and a second volume of ‘‘Masterpieces
of Painting,’ by Huntington Cairns and John Walker, was in process.
More than 28,000 persons attended the special tours of the Gallery,

922758—51——2
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

26,000 the “Picture of the Week” talks, and 17,000 the 13 Sunday-
afternoon lectures in the auditorium. Forty-five Sunday-evening
concerts were given in the East Garden Court. The work of con-
struction of new galleries and offices for expanding activities con-
tinued, and 12 new galleries were opened, 8 just prior to and 4 just
after the end of the fiscal year.

National Collection of Fine Arts—The Smithsonian Art Commission
met on December 6, 1949, and accepted two paintings for the National
Collection. One miniature was acquired through the Catherine
Walden Myer fund. Thirteen special art exhibitions were held
during the year, especially noteworthy being a 4%-month showing of
paintings by Abbott Handerson Thayer (1849-1921) in commemo-
ration of the centennial of this artist’s birth and featuring his studies
on camouflage and on protective coloration in the Animal Kingdom;
and an exhibit of paintings of ancient Egyptian monuments by Joseph
Lindon Smith. Members of the staff lectured on art topics to several
organizations and as usual furnished information to several hundred
visitors and identified many art works submitted.

Freer Gallery of Art.—Accessions to the Freer collections included
Egyptian brasswork and crystal; Chinese bronzes, jade, lacquer, and
pottery; Persian painting, pottery, and wood carving; Indian painting
and sculpture; Japanese sculpture; and Armenian manuscript. The
work of the professional staff was devoted to the study of new acces-
sions and objects submitted for purchase and to general research on
Oriental and Near East materials. Reports were made on 2,236
objects. The renovation of Whistler’s Peacock Room, mentioned in
last year’s report, was well along toward completion by the end of
the year. Visitors to the Gallery totaled 62,801, and 1,626 came to
the Gallery offices for special purposes. During the year the Gallery
entered into an agreement with the University of Michigan in further-
ance of the principles concerning Oriental art contemplated by the
will of the late Charles L. Freer.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—The Director of the Bureau, Dr.
M. W. Stirling, continued his studies of archeological collections he
had made in Panamd. As for the past 4 years, the Associate Director,
Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, Jr., directed the operations of the River Basin
Surveys, in cooperation with the National Park Service, the Bureau
of Reclamation, and the Army Corps of Engineers, and made several
field inspection trips. Since the beginning of the program in July
1946, 2,260 archeological sites have been located and recorded, and
484 of these have been recommended for testing or excavation. This
year’s survey work covered 26 reservoirs located in 8 States and in
5 river basins. At the end of the year excavations were completed
or under way in 13 reservoir areas in 9 States. Dr. John P. Harring-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 8)

ton continued his study of the grammar of the Abnaki language at
Old Town, Maine, and also spent 2 months in Yucatén studying the
Maya language. In cooperation with the Canadian Government,
Dr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., conducted archeological investigations on
Cornwallis Island in the Canadian Arctic, which yielded a large
collection of artifacts that throw considerable light on the prehistoric
inhabitants of the region. Dr. W. N. Fenton made further studies
of the Iroquois, especially at the Tonawanda and Allegany Seneca
reservations in western New York, and surveyed considerable perti-
nent archival material in various libraries.

The Institute of Social Anthropology, an autonomous unit of the
Bureau financed by State Department funds, conducted its anthro-
pological teaching and research programs in the following Latin
American countries: Brazil, Colombia, México, and Pert. Dr.
George M. Foster, Director of the Institute, conducted private inves-
tigations in Spain during most of the year. Dr. Gordon R. Willey,
senior anthrolopologist of the Bureau, served as acting director during
his absence.

The Bureau issued its annual report, volume 5 of the “Handbook
of South American Indians,’ and one publication of the Institute of
Social Anthropology. Ten publications were in press at the close of
the year.

International Exchange Service—The Smithsonian International
Exchange Service is the official United States agency for the inter-
change of governmental, literary, and scientific publications between
this country and the other nations of the world. During the past
year the Exchange Service handled 1,009,675 packages of such publi-
cations, weighing 832,087 pounds, a considerable increase over the
previous year. Consignments are now made to all countries except
Rumania and China. The number of sets of United States official
publications sent abroad in exchange for similar publications of other
countries is now 99 (59 full and 40 partial sets). Eighty-three copies
of the Federal Register and 87 copies of the Congressional Record are
also sent abroad through the Exchange Service.

National Zoological Park.—The zoo collection was enhanced during
the year by the addition of a number of animals never before exhibited
here. At the end of the fiscal year there were 2,821 specimens in the
collection, a decrease of 126 from the previous year. Among the more
spectacular accessions were a pair of baby elephants presented by the
Government of India, through Prime Minister Nehru and the Indian
Embassy in Washington; 3 grizzly bears removed from the Yellow-
stone National Park and presented by the National Park Service;
2 rare pencil-tailed tree mice from Malaya; and an American black-
bear cub, ‘‘Smoky,” rescued by the Forest Service from a forest fire
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

in New Mexico. In all, 123 creatures were born or hatched at the
Zoo—60 mammals, 17 birds, and 46 reptiles. Both pairs of the Zoo’s
hybrid bears (female Alaska brown X male polar) produced cubs.
The number of visitors to the Zoo reached the all-time record of
3,437,669, which was 91,619 more than last year. Groups from
schools numbered 1,973, aggregating 102,553 individuals, and came
from 31 States, some as far away as Maine, Florida, Washington,
California, and New Mexico.

Astrophysical Observatory.—Late in the year the Director, L. B.
Aldrich, made an inspection trip to the two solar-radiation field sta-
tions now operated by the Astrophysical Observatory, one at Table
Mountain, Calif., and the other at Montezuma, Chile, and was able
to make valuable intercomparisons of methods and results of the
research. A significant increase of one-fourth of 1 percent in the
radiation emitted by the sun in the two decades from 1925 to 1944
has been calculated from the solar-constant determinations at the
Chilean station. The Observatory’s work at the temporary observing
station at Miami, Fla., for the office of the Quartermaster General, in
connection with studies of fabric resistance to solar radiation, were
terminated there, and the special equipment was moved to the Table
Mountain, Calif., station. Three silver-disk pyrheliometers were con-
structed under the supervision of W. H. Hoover and furnished at cost
to institutions in New Zealand, Venezuela, and Rumania, and two
modified Angstrom pyrheliometers and one special water-vapor
spectroscope were furnished to a meteorological institute in Belgium.
The Division of Radiation and Organisms concluded its reorganization
and reconstruction of the facilities of its laboratories, which are now
equipped with four constant-temperature rooms and with new types
of modern instruments and are in first-class condition for photo-
chemical research on plants. Several new lines of research are being
inaugurated. The sixth edition of the Smithsonian Meteorological
Tables, compiled by Robert J. List, of the United States Weather
Bureau, was in press at the close of the year; and the manuscript of
the ninth edition of the Physical Tables was nearly completed under
the direction of Dr. William E. Forsythe, physicist, of Cleveland,
Ohio.

National Air Museum.—The report to Congress on the National
Air Museum, required by law, was submitted on March 17, 1950,
making recommendations for the acquisition of suitable lands and
buildings for the museum. The Advisory Board met on May 24 and
gave considerable attention to this report and to the problems involved
in advancing the Air Museum’s site-procurement and building pro-
grams. Several outstanding accessions to the collections were re-
ceived, including the B-29 superfort Enola Gay, the first aircraft to
SECRETARY'S REPORT et

drop an atomic bomb in warfare; the Stinson SR-10F airplane used
by All American Aviation in airmail pick-up service; the City of
Washington, the Piper Super Cruiser flown around the world in 1947
by Clifford Evans, Jr.; a collection of memorabilia relating to Amelia
Earhart; the original Whittle W-1-X turbojet engine; a bust of
Wilbur Wright by Oskar J. W. Hansen; and a large collection of
aeronautical memorabilia assembled by Mrs. (‘‘Mother’’) C. A.
Tusch, of Berkeley, Calif. The 34 new accessions totaled 465 objects
from 31 different sources. Much of the material is being kept at the
Museum’s storage facility maintained at Park Ridge, Il., until such
time as the projected National Air Museum building is provided.

Canal Zone Biological Area.—Twenty-one scientists, representing a
variety of organizations and localities, visited Barro Colorado Island
during the year and worked at the laboratory on an equal variety of
research projects, and the contributions have added materially to our
knowledge of tropical life. High cost of transportation deters many
from visiting the island. Since the laboratory was started in 1923,
about 660 separate papers have appeared in print dealing with re-
searches made on the area. A recent checklist shows 173 species of
vertebrate animals (exclusive of birds) now inhabiting the island.
Improvements in facilities completed during the year included the
construction of an 11,720-gallon concrete water tank, which has im-
proved the water-supply situation at the station as well as fire pro-
tection. Some new building construction is under way. One of the
most urgent needs is a dependable electric-power supply. The
resident manager continued his long-term termite-resistance tests and
studies of host relationships of the fruit-fly population.

PUBLICATIONS

In carrying out the second of the two main functions of the Smith-
sonian Institution, the diffusion of knowledge, as prescribed by its
founder, James Smithson, the Institution issues eight regular series
of publications and six others that appear less frequently. All these
series, embodying the results of researches of the Smithsonian staff
and collaborators, are distributed free to more than a thousand
libraries, both here and abroad, as well as to a large list of educational
and scientific organizations. The findings of Smithsonian scientists,
chiefly in the fields of anthroplogy, biology, geology, and astrophysics,
are therefore made readily available to all through this wide free
distribution.

In all, 72 publications appeared under the Smithsonian imprint
during the year. Outstanding among these were T. E. Snyder’s
“Catalog of the Termites of the World,’ Gordon R. Willey’s ‘‘ Arche-
ology of the Florida Gulf Coast,” the eighteenth part of A. C. Bent’s
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

“Tafe Histories of North American Birds,” volume 5 of the “Handbook
of South American Indians,’ Allan R. Holmberg’s ‘Nomads of the
Long Bow: The Siriono of Eastern Bolivia,” S. H. Oliver’s ‘Catalog
of the Automobile and Motorcycle Collection of the Division of
Engineering, United States National Museum,” and Grace Dunham
Guest’s ‘‘Shiraz Painting in the Sixteenth Century.”

The total number of copies of publications in all series distributed
during the year was 150,612. A complete list of the year’s publica-
tions will be found in the report of the chief of the editorial division,

appendix 12.
LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library received 53,035 publications during the
year, 7,392 of these being gifts from many different donors. Out-
standing among the gifts was the fine collection of about 4,000 books
and pamphlets on Foraminifera assembled by the late Joseph A.
Cushman and bequeathed by him to the Institution. Neil M. Judd
donated his personal collection of about 500 books and papers on
archeological subjects.

Currently entered were 16,961 periodicals, most of them received
in exchange for Smithsonian publications from research institutions
and educational organizations throughout the world. The library
arranged 344 new exchanges during the year, cataloged 6,822 volumes
and pamphlets, added 30,006 cards to catalogs and shelflists, sent
18,719 publications to the Library of Congress, prepared 1,511 volumes
for binding, and repaired 1,023 volumes in the Museum.

At the close of the year, the library’s holdings totaled 927,037
volumes, more than half of which are housed in the Library of Congress
as the Smithsonian Deposit.

Respectfully submitted.

ALEXANDER WETMORE, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: [have the honor to submit the following report on the condition
and operations of the United States National Museum for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1950:

COLLECTIONS

Slightly more than 793,300 specimens (approximately 400,000 more
than last year) were incorporated into the national collections during
the year and were distributed among the six departments as follows:
Anthropology, 4,982; zoology, 186,855; botany, 61,983; geology,
530,758; engineering and industries, 2,047; and history, 6,701. Most
of the accessions were acquired as gifts from individuals or as transfers
from Government departments and agencies. The complete report on
the Museum, published as a separate document, includes a detailed
list of the year’s acquisitions, of which the more important are sum-
marized below. Catalog entries in all departments now total
32,375,097.

Anthropology.—President Harry S. Truman deposited on loan the
sacred Scrolls of the Law, hand-lettered in Hebrew on parchment, and
a copper Ark finely decorated with biblical inscriptions in silver by
skilled craftsmen of the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts of Jerusalem.
These were presented by Chaim Weizmann, first President of Israel, to
the President of the United States. Two camel saddles, bridles, and
elaborately woven and decorated saddlebags presented by His
Majesty, King Ibn Sa’ud of Saudi Arabia, as tokens of friendship to
Maj. Gen. C. V. Haynes and Rear Adm. John P. Whitney, were
donated to the Museum by the recipients.

Woven fabrics and costumes acquired by the late Gen. John J.
Pershing from the Moro, Mandaya, and Bagobo during his tours of
duty in the Philippine Islands between 1899 and 1913, and from
Peruvian and Bolivian Indians during his visit to South America in
1924-25, were presented by his son, Francis Warren Pershing. Other

EXPLORATION AND FIELD WORK

During the first half of the fiscal year, Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, at that
time associate curator of archeology, was detailed to the River Basin
Surveys, Bureau of American Ethnology, to supervise field and
laboratory operations in the Missouri Valley.

_ Under the W. L. Abbott fund, M. A. Carriker, Jr., during the
present season continued investigations of the bird life of northern
Colombia, making collections in the lower Atrato Basin. He entered
the area from Medellin, proceeding by air to Turbo, then moving by
boat to stations on each side of the Gulf of Urab&. His investigations
continued along the lower Atrato, in part near the Panamanian
frontier, extending finally into more elevated regions above Frontino.
Examples of more than 500 species of birds were obtained in this
interesting region where there is union between the forms of life found
in eastern Panam4 and those of northwestern South America.

Dr. Alexander Wetmore, with Watson M. Perrygo as assistant,
was again in the field in eastern Panama from the middle of February
to the beginning of April, their work being concerned with the collec-
tion and distribution of birds. Through the friendly assistance of
Brig. Gen. R. Beam, commanding officer, Albrook Air Base, and of
Lt. Col. M. E. Potter, director of personnel services, in providing
transportation by water and other facilities, a base was established
in Chim4n on the Pacific coast about 90 miles east of Panama City.
The party worked first on the lower portion of the Rio Chiman and
then moved in cayucos to the head of tidewater on the Rio Majé.
From here the naturalists proceeded on foot with porters to the lower
elevations of Cerro Chucanti in the Serranfa de Majé. The region
covered was in an extensive area of virgin forest without human
inhabitants, beyond the limit of navigation by canoe. An excellent
collection of birds was obtained in a region that so far as known has
not been visited previously by naturalists.
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

Under a cooperative arrangement with the United States Weather
Bureau, Charles O. Handley, Jr., was detailed to make natural-history
collections on Prince Patrick Island in the Canadian Arctic Archi-
pelago. As the year closed, the curator of birds, Dr. Herbert Fried-
mann, was en route to South Africa and southern Rhodesia to study
the habits of the parasitic honey-guides and weaverbirds, having
received grants for the purpose from the American Philosophical
Society and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.

Associate Curator Paul L. Illg assembled data on the life histories
and ecology of commensal copepods at the University of Washington
oceanographic laboratories at Friday Harbor. Dr. J. P. E. Morrison,
associate curator of mollusks, made a short field study of mollusks
inhabiting the salt marshes on the eastern shore of Maryland. Assist-
ant Curator R. Tucker Abbott was detailed, at the request of the
Pacific Science Board, National Research Council, to conduct field
studies in Kenya and Tanganyika, East Africa, for the purpose of
obtaining carnivorous snails and transporting them to the Trust
Territories of the Pacific, a part of the program planned for the control
of the destructive giant snail in that area.

W. L. Brown, chief exhibits preparator, visited South Carolina and
Wyoming to procure background materials required for the completion
and installation of the Virginia-deer and pronghorn-antelope exhibi-
tion groups in the North American mammal hall.

Head Curator E. P. Killip and Curator Jason R. Swallen were en-
gaged for 3 weeks in botanical field studies on Big Pine Key, Fla.,
collecting specimens and making observations on the distribution of
plant life. At the request of the Department of Agriculture, Mr.
Swallen was detailed to the Great Plains Field Station at Mandan,
N. Dak., to review experimental work now being conducted there on
the crested wheatgrass, and to the Texas Research Foundation at
Kingsville, Tex., to complete a survey of the grasses of that region.
Dr. George A. Llano, associate curator of cryptogams, made extensive
collections of lichens under the auspices of the Arctic Institute of
North America after proceeding to the Arctic Research Laboratory
at Point Barrow, Alaska, where he was provided with transportation
to Wainwright, Umiat on the Colville River, Anaktuvuk Pass in the
Brooks Range, and Anchorage. On the return trip Dr. Llano made
collections on several islands in the Aleutian Chain. Associate
Curator Paul S. Conger, division of cryptogams, was engaged in
studying marine diatoms for 2 months at the Chesapeake Biological
Laboratory, Solomons Island, Md. Dr. F. A. McClure, research
associate in grasses, continued with his studies of the bamboos in the
West Indies, Central America, and South America.
SECRETARY’S REPORT Pal

At the request of the Instituto de Antropologia e Historia, Dr.
W. F. Foshag, head curator of geology, on detail from the National
Museum, traveled to Guatemala and devoted 3 months to a study of
the mineralogical composition of Meso-American archeological jade
objects in the Museo de Antropologia at Guatemala City, the well-
known Rossbach collection in the Municipal Museum at Chichecasten-
ango, the Robles collection at Quetzaltenango, and the Nottlebahn
collections. As part of a project relating to the mineralogy and geo-
chemistry of saline mineral deposits, Dr. George S. Switzer spent 3
months investigating the origin and occurrence of rare sulfate minerals
at The Geysers and Island Mountain, Calif.

Paleontological field work financed from the income of the Walcott
bequest brought new materials from Panamé, Cuba, and the United
States to the collections. The four field parties studying problems
in invertebrate paleontology in the United States comprised the fol-
lowing: Dr. G. A. Cooper, W. T. Allen, and Alwyn Williams, visiting
Commonwealth Fellow from Wales, collected lower Middle Ordovician
brachiopods at various localities in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Tennessee, Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico;
Dr. A. R. Loeblich and W. T. Allen carried on field investigtaions in
the Lower Cretaceous of Oklahoma and Texas; lower Middle Ordo-
vician strata in Pennsylvania and New York were examined by Dr.
Cooper and Mr. Williams; and David Nicol visited Upper Cretaceous
and Tertiary beds in North Carolina and Virginia. Dr. C. L. Gazin,
curator of vertebrate paleontology, assisted by F. L. Pearce, searched
for Paleocene mammals in the Puerco and Torrejon horizons in the
San Juan Basin of New Mexico, and later in the season transferred
the field work to the Lower Eocene Knight formation in the vicinity
of Big Piney and LaBarge in western Wyoming. At the invitation
of the Museo Nacional de Panamé and with the cooperation of the
Panamanian Government, Dr. Gazin, with Dr. T. E. White as assist-
ant, proceeded to Herrera Province where they achieved considerable
success in the excavation of remains of the giant ground sloth Mega-
therium. A part of this collection will eventually be returned to Panama
for display. Associate Curator David H. Dunkle was highly success-
ful in obtaining an excellent series of fossil fish and ammonites from
the Jurassic Jagua formation in the Pifiar del Rio region of western
Cuba.

PUBLICATIONS

During the fiscal year 1949-50, 29 publications were issued: 1 Annual
Report, 2 in the Bulletin series, 22 in the Proceedings, and 4 numbers of
the Contributions from the United States National Herbarium. A list
of these is given in the complete report on Smithsonian publications,

of art. About 300 paintings were studied and considered for possible
acquisition. About 1,000 inquiries requiring research were answered.
During the year, 11 individual lectures were given by members of the
curatorial staff, both at the Gallery and elsewhere. In addition, Miss
Elizabeth Mongan conducted special weekly classes at Alverthorpe,
Jenkintown, Pa., for students from Beaver College; Perry B. Cott
participated in the oral examination of a candidate for a master’s
degree in art from Indiana University and prepared an examination for
two students at American University for their master’s degrees in art;
and Charles M. Richards gave two courses in art history under the
auspices of the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Cott also represented
the National Gallery at a conference at the Peabody Museum, Salem,

can Association of Museums meeting at Colorado Springs, Colo.

Special installations were prepared for the Art Treasures from the

the George Martin Richter Archives.

Necessary restoration and repair of works of art in the Gallery’s

32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

ant restorer to the Gallery on December 1, 1949. All work was com-
pleted in the restorer’s studio in the Gallery with the exception of the
restoration of two paintings begun before the death of Mr. Pichetto in
January 1949 and completed in the New York studio by Mr. Pichetto’s
residual staff. Both paintings have been returned to the Gallery in
good condition.

PUBLICATIONS

During the year Huntington Cairns contributed articles and reviews
to the Yale Law Journal, the Harvard Law Review, the Virginia
Quarterly Review, and the Baltimore Evening Sun. He also delivered
four lectures at the Johns Hopkins University on the theory of
criticism.

The series of 12 articles on ‘Masterpieces in the Gallery” by John
Walker, published in the Ladies’ Home Journal, was completed in
December 1949, making a total of 36 articles by Mr. Walker, prin-
cipally on the Gallery’s collection, published in that periodical since
1946. An article by Mr. Walker on “The Vienna Treasures and Their
Collectors’ appeared in the National Geographic Magazine for June
1950. Erwin O. Christensen contributed two articles to Antiques
Magazine: “Justice,” published in January 1950, and ‘What Is
American Folk Art?”’ published in May 1950. James W. Lane con-
tributed four book reviews to the Catholic World, on “John Singleton
Copley,” by James T. Flexner, “Cream Hill,” by Lewis Gannett,
“The Twelve Seasons,” by Joseph Wood Krutch, and ‘“The Virgin and
Child,” with introduction by Thomas Bodkin; he also wrote a review
of ‘‘Martin Johnson Heade,” by Robert G. McIntyre, for the summer,
1949, issue of the College Art Journal. An article by Charles M.
Richards, ‘‘Standard Procedure for Intermuseum Loans,” was pub-
lished in Museum News.

An illustrated catalog of recent acquisitions to the Rosenwald
Collection was compiled by Miss Elizabeth Mongan and was issued for
the opening of the Rosenwald exhibition on April 9, 1950. An illus-
trated catalog of the “(Makers of History in Washington, 1800-1950,”
was prepared by Perry B. Cott and James W. Lane for the opening of
the ‘‘“Makers of History in Washington, 1800-1950” exhibition.

A second volume of “Masterpieces of Painting from the National
Gallery of Art,” by Huntington Cairns and John Walker, is in process,
and Perry B. Cott has begun the preparation of a catalog on Renais-
sance bronzes.

During the past fiscal year the publications fund supplemented
the group of color reproductions offered to the public with four new
color postcard subjects and a new 11-by-14-inch reproduction;
12 more of the latter are on order, to be utilized in a forthcoming
SECRETARY'S REPORT 33

portfolio of religious subjects. Four large collotype reproductions
were added to the long list of this type of print available.

A companion volume to ‘Masterpieces of Painting,’ namely,
“Masterpieces of Sculpture from the National Gallery of Art,’ an
illustrated catalog of the Mellon Collection, and ‘‘Popular Art in the
United States,’’ by Erwin O. Christensen, were placed on sale during
the fiscal year 1951. The third large printing of the illustrated Kress
catalog was completed during the year.

The publication date of ‘“The Index of American Design” (formerly
entitled ‘“Made in America’’), by Erwin O. Christensen, has been set
at October 15, 1950, and “Pictures from America,” by John Walker,
is also to be published soon.

While the exhibition of Art Treasures from the Vienna Collections
was on view, the Publications Fund distributed over 53,000 catalogs
and more than 36,000 color postcards; and made available other
publications dealing with the Austrian exhibition.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

More than 28,000 persons attended the General, Congressional, and
Special Tours during the fiscal year, with the attendance for the
“Picture of the Week” talks reaching a total of over 26,000. Lectures
on special subjects, with lantern slides, were given in the auditorium
on Sunday afternoons; 13 of these were by visiting lecturers, and the
total attendance was 17,000. A black-and-white strip-film of 300
representative paintings from the Gallery’s collections has been very
much in demand. The slide collection and the film “The National
Gallery of Art’ have been widely distributed during the year.

The Educational Office has continued the publication of a monthly
Calendar of Events announcing all the Gallery activities, including
notices of exhibitions, new publications, lectures, gallery talks, tours,
and concerts. Approximately 4,600 copies of the calendar are mailed
each month.

LIBRARY

A very important contribution to the Library this year was the
purchase of 997 books, 3,395 pamphlets, 15,518 photographs, 418
periodicals, and 9 subscriptions from funds presented to the Gallery
by Paul Mellon. Other gifts included 153 books, 103 of them pre-
sented by Lessing J. Rosenwald, 42 pamphlets, and 1 periodical.
Fifteen books and subscriptions to 30 periodicals were purchased
from otherfunds. Five hundred and ninety books, pamphlets, period-
icals, and bulletins were received on exchange from other institutions.
During the year 535 persons other than the Gallery staff used the
Library for purposes of art research either in person or by phone.
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

INDEX OF AMERICAN DESIGN

During the fiscal year, 108 examples from the Index were reproduced
in publications, and 719 examples were borrowed for use in forthcoming
publications. More than 1,100 photographs of the Index were sent
out for use by designers, for research and study, and for publicity.
The Index material was studied by 468 persons, 399 of whom were
new users. Three hundred and thirty-nine slides were circulated for
use in lectures. A total of 2,057 Index plates were sent out for ex~
hibition and publication purposes during the fiscal year 1950.

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW GALLERIES AND OFFICES

In keeping with the recommendation of the Committee on the
Building and the Board of Trustees, a contract was entered into
on June 19, 1949, for the completion of 12 galleries in the east end of
the building. Eight of these galleries were completed in time to be
used for the Sesquicentennial exhibition, “Makers of History in
Washington, 1800-1950.”” The remaining four were completed by
July 15, 1950. A similar contract was entered into on March 10,
1950, for the completion of five offices and a slide storage room in
the west wing on the ground floor. Work is progressing satisfactorily,
and it is contemplated that this project will be completed by early fall.

CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE BUILDING

The Gallery building and grounds, and the mechanical equipment,
were maintained throughout the year at the high standard established
in the past. Among the nonrecurring and unusual items were the
construction of a 48-foot cold frame to increase facilities for growing
plants for the garden courts; the construction of bases and pedestals
for exhibition material of the Austrian exhibition; construction of
additional exhibition facilities for the Bliss exhibit; complete over-
hauling and realigning of air-conditioning refrigeration machine
No. 3; and the construction of storage facilities on the 81-foot level.

COMMITTEE OF EXPERT EXAMINERS

The United States Civil Service Commission’s Committee of Expert
Examiners, composed of staff members of the Gallery, graded the
Museum Art Specialist examination papers. Registers of eligibles
were established, and appointments made therefrom.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

Forty-five Sunday evening concerts were given in the East Garden
Court during the fiscal year. Two Saturday afternoon concerts were
given in the lecture hall, thus making a total of 47 musical perform-
ances at the Gallery this year. The Seventh Annual Music Festival
SECRETARY’S REPORT 35

was held in May, with 41 works by American composers included in
the programs.

The Photographic Laboratory of the Gallery produced 11,000
prints, 1,029 black-and-white slides, 903 color slides, and 2,418
negatives in the fiscal year 1950, in addition to infrared and ultra-
violet photographs, X-rays, and color separations.

A total of 2,890 press releases, 171 permits to copy paintings in the
Gallery, and 182 special permits to photograph in the Gallery were
issued during the fiscal year 1950.

OTHER GIFTS

Gifts of books on works of art and related material were made to
the Gallery by Paul Mellon and others. Gifts of money during the
fiscal year 1950 were made by The A. W. Mellon Educational and
Charitable Trust, Lessing J. Rosenwald, and Mrs. C. B. Myhre. An
additional cash bequest was received from the Estate of the late
William Nelson Cromwell.

AUDIT OF PRIVATE FUNDS OF THE GALLERY

An audit of the private funds of the Gallery has been made for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1950, by Price, Waterhouse & Co., public
accountants, and the certificate of that company on its examination
of the accounting records maintained for such funds will be forwarded
to the Gallery.

THE HENRY WARD RANGER FUND

Since it is a provision of the Ranger bequest that the paintings pur-
chased by the Council of the National Academy of Design from the
fund provided by the Henry Ward Ranger bequest, and assigned to
American art institutions, may be claimed by the National Collection
of Fine Arts during the 5-year period beginning 10 years after the death
of the artist represented, two paintings were recalled for action of the
Smithsonian Art Commission at its meeting December 6, 1950:

Oil painting, Gold Mining, Cripple Creek, by Ernest Lawson, listed earlier in
this report, was accepted by the Commission to become a permanent accession.

LIBRARY

During the year the following work was accomplished in the library:

Accessions, including books, pamphlets, periodicals, rubbings, study
material, and photographs, 826; cataloging of all kinds, including
cards typed and filed, 5,518; binding, repairing, and mounting, 762.
The Japanese publication Biyutsu Kenkyu was analyzed, and work
on the analyzing of the Japanese periodical Kokka was started.

PUBLICATIONS

Two publications of the Gallery were issued during the year:

Guest, Grace Dunham: Shiraz Painting in the Sixteenth Century (Oriental
Studies No. 4). 8. I. Publ. 3978. October 1949.

Stubbs, Burns A.: James McNeill Whistler, A Biographical Outline Illustrated
from the Collections of the Freer Gallery of Art (Occasional Papers, vol. 1,
No. 4). S. I. Publ. 3994. February 1950.

One article by a staff member appeared in an outside publication:

Wenley, A. G.: The Question of the Po-Shan-Hsiang-Lu. Archives of the
Chinese Art Society of America, vol. 3, p. 5, 1948-1949,

REPRODUCTIONS

During the year the photographic laboratory made 3,631 prints,
434 glass negatives, and 19 lantern slides.

BUILDING

The cabinet shop has been constantly occupied in the usual work of
making necessary equipment, certain repairs to the collections, the
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

Peacock Room, and minor repairs to the building. Lack of a painter,
however, has badly handicapped operations, so that work of this
nature is far behind schedule. At least half of the exhibition galleries
need redecorating, while many other parts of the building are in crying
need of attention.

An important project was the construction of a counter for the
display and sale of publications and photographs in the entrance
lobby. This relieved the understaffed administration office of
considerable work.

ATTENDANCE

The Gallery was open to the public from 9 to 4:30 every day except
Christmas Day. The total number of visitors to come in the main
entrance was 62,801. The highest monthly attendance was in
August with 8,550, and the lowest was in December with 1,951.

There were 1,626 visitors to the main office during the year.

COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

Under the provisions of the will of the late Charles L. Freer, there
was created at the University of Michigan a fund, the income from
which is to be used to add to the knowledge and appreciation of
Oriental art, primarily in aid of research to be conducted by experts
regarding the art objects embraced in a collection of Oriental art
transferred by the testator to the Smithsonian Institution, and for
the publication of the results of such research. Therefore, the
University of Michigan and the Freer Gallery of Art have entered into
a collaborative arrangement to carry out the broad general principles
concerning the program in Oriental art contemplated by the will of
Charles L. Freer. Briefly, to implement this arrangement the
following actions have been or will be taken:

1. Mr. Wenley has been appointed research professor of Oriental art in the
Department of Fine Arts of the University of Michigan without salary and
on an annual basis.

2. Dr. Ettinghausen has been appointed research professor of Islamic art in the
Department of Fine Arts of the University of Michigan without salary and
on an annual basis.

3.4,The university shall appoint a professor of Oriental art in the Department
of Fine Arts of the University of Michigan as soon as practicable. It is
the purpose of the university to appoint to this position a scholar to whom
the Gallery will also be prepared to offer a joint appointment, without
salary and on an annual basis, as research associate in the Gallery.

4, The university has appointed a committee of the Freer fund consisting of
the dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, the
chairman of the Department of Fine Arts, the chairman of the General
Committee of the Division of Fine Arts, and the research professor of
Oriental art in the Department of Fine Arts (Director of the Freer Gal-
lery). This committee is authorized to determine the program of research
SECRETARY’S REPORT 47

and publication to be carried on with funds derived from the income of
the Freer fund, and to prepare an annual budget for presentation to the
provost of the university for the expenditure of such funds.

5. The University of Michigan and the Freer Gallery of Art are collaborating
in the publication of a series to be known as Ars Orientalis. This will
succeed the university’s Freer fund publication Ars Islamica, which has
been edited at the Freer Gallery since 1944. In its greater breadth of
treatment Ars Orientalis will supplement other Gallery publications.

6. The Freer Fund Committee has established a Charles L. Freer fellowship
in Oriental art, which may be given to candidates for the doctoral degree
and entitles the holder to a year of advanced work at the Freer Gallery
of Art. In this connection the Director of the Freer Gallery is serving on
the standing committee on graduate work in Oriental art of the Depart-
ment of Fine Arts, University of Michigan.

Either party to the above-mentioned arrangement may terminate
this by the giving of a year’s notice to the other party of its intention
to terminate.

DOCENT SERVICE AND OTHER STAFF ACTIVITIES

By request 19 groups met in the exhibition galleries for instruction
by staff members. Total attendance was 369.

On invitation the following lectures were given outside the Gallery

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Srr: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1950, conducted
in accordance with the Act of Congress of April 10, 1928, as amended
August 22, 1949, which provides for continuing ‘‘independently or in
cooperation anthropological researches among the American Indians
and the natives of lands under the jurisdiction or protection of the
United States and the excavation and preservation of archeologic
remains.”

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

Dr. M. W. Stirling, Director of the Bureau, devoted most of his
time during the fiscal year to administrative affairs of the Bureau.
He also continued studies on the archeological collections made in
Panamé during the winter of 1948-49, particularly on the ceramic
collection from the site of Utivé in the Province of Panama. With
the exception of a few brief trips for the purpose of attending scientific
meetings or giving lectures, the entire year was spent in Washington.

Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Associate Director of the Bureau
and Director of the River Basin Surveys, spent most of the fiscal year
in administering and directing the River Basin Surveys. In Septem-
ber he attended the Twenty-ninth International Congress of Ameri-
canists where he gave an illustrated talk on the program and work
of the River Basin Surveys. Early in October he participated in the
annual meeting of the National Council for Historic Sites and Build-
ings at Williamsburg, Va. From Williamsburg he went to the Joshua
S. and John E. Williamson farm near Dinwiddie to examine an archeo-
logical site where considerable material attributable to the eastern
variant of the Folsom culture had been found. That particular site
is one of the most extensive of its kind thus far noted in the East, and,
if excavated, should provide valuable information.

Later in October Dr. Roberts visited the Missouri Basin head-
quarters at Lincoln, Nebr., and, accompanied by Paul L. Cooper,
proceeded to the Angostura Reservoir in South Dakota where a
series of excavations was under way. After spending several days
with the field party, they went to Wyoming to examine the site for

48
SECRETARY’S REPORT 49

the proposed Edgemont Reservoir on the Cheyenne River. From
there they went to Fort Collins, Colo., where the Horsetooth Reser-
voir is under construction, and examined paleontological and archeo-
logical specimens uncovered in the process of the work. Returning
to Washington early in November, Dr. Roberts went to Richmond,
Va., and gave the principal address before the annual meeting of the
Eastern States Archeological Federation. The subject of his talk
was the progress and results of the River Basin program.

Late in November and early in December Dr. Roberts was again in
Lincoln, Nebr., where he assisted in making plans for reorganizing
the laboratory and field headquarters. While there he took part in
the Seventh Conference for Plains Archeology and presided over one
of the symposia dealing with the problems of Plains archeology.

In February and March Dr. Roberts visited the Departments of
Anthropology at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City; the Univer-
sity of Washington, Seattle; the University of Oregon, Eugene; and
the University of California, Berkeley. He discussed the plans for
field work during the coming season and made arrangements for
student help and field assistants for the River Basin Surveys parties.
While at Eugene he also inspected the field headquarters and labora-
tory for the Columbia Basin project and assisted Joel L. Shiner, the
acting field director, in making plans for the summer season. Enroute
back to Washington, Dr. Roberts visited the Department of Anthro-
pology at the University of Denver, where he talked with Arnold M.
Withers about the cooperation of that institution in the program in
Colorado. From there he proceeded to Lincoln to plan for the sum-
mer’s work in that area. At that time he also spoke on the River
Basin program before the annual meeting of the Nebraska State
Press Association at Omaha.

In May Dr. Roberts visited the Fort Gibson Reservoir in Oklahoma
and discussed plans for additional projects with the District Engineer
at Tulsa. At Norman, Okla., he examined materials which had been
salvaged from sites at the Fort Gibson Reservoir by a field party from
the University of Oklahoma and also attended sessions of the annual
meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. From Oklahoma
Dr. Roberts went to Texas, visiting the Garza-Little Elm, Lavon,
and Belton Reservoir projects. He also spent several days at the
Whitney Reservoir where one of the River Basin Surveys parties
under Robert L. Stephenson was excavating a series of Indian sites.
From the Whitney Reservoir he went to Austin to inspect the field
headquarters and laboratory located at the University of Texas.

During the period July 1 through October 24, 1949, Dr. John P.
Harrington contiuued the study of the grammar of the Abnaki lan-
guage at Old Town, Maine. The Abnaki language is the only one of
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

the Indian languages of New England that is still spoken. Abnaki
forms throw considerable light on the closely related, extinct Massa-
chusetts language in which the famous Eliot Indian Bible is written.
The earliest vocabulary, or vocabularies, of the Abnaki language re-
sulted from the work of French missionaries in the Kennebec Valley,
but the work has been lost. The maps and writings of Capt. John
Smith, Champlain, and Lescarbot carry a number of Abnaki place
names. The earliest extensive Abnaki vocabulary is that attributed
to Capt. George Weymouth and was probably taken down by him in
1605 from Abnaki Indians whom he captured near the St. George
Islands, off the eastern end of Penobscot Bay, and took to England.
This vocabulary was first printed in 1625. In 1691, 86 years after
the Weymouth Abnaki vocabulary had been made, a young French
missionary priest named Sebastian Rasles arrived in Canada and
compiled his vast French-Abnaki dictionary. This dictionary was
captured by the English at the battle of Norridgewock in 1724 and
was first printed in 1833.

On February 9, 1950, Dr. Harrington proceeded to Mérida, Yuca-
tan, for the purpose of studying the Maya language. A tape recorder
was taken along and 10 half-hour recordings of stories told in the
Maya language were obtained. Dr. Harrington returned to Wash-
ington on April 11, bringing with him a large quantity of linguistic
material.

At the invitation of the Canadian Government, Dr. Henry B.
Collins, Jr., conducted archeological investigations on Cornwallis
Island in the northern part of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.
Excavations were made at four prehistoric Eskimo village sites at
Resolute Bay on the south side of the Island. Dr. Collins and his
assistant, Jean P. Michea, reached Resolute by plane on May 27 after
brief stops at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island, and at Thule in north-
west Greenland. The work continued until August 23, 1949. The
numerous house ruins on Cornwallis and neighboring islands show
that this now uninhabited region once supported a sizable Eskimo
population. The Cornwallis Island structures—built of stones,
whalebones, and turf—proved to have been made by the Thule
Eskimos, a prehistoric group that originated in Alaska and later
spread eastward to Canada and Greenland. A large collection of
artifacts was obtained which, after study, will be divided between the
Smithsonian and the National Museum of Canada, joint sponsors of
the work. As the natural history of Cornwallis Island is so little
known, an attempt was made to collect representative samples of
fossils, minerals, vascular plants, mosses and lichens, insects, and
fresh-water invertebrates.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 51

Dr. Collins organized a symposium on Arctic anthropology as part
of the program for the Twenty-ninth International Congress of
Americanists held in New York in September 1949, the participants
being anthropologists, archeologists, and linguists from the United
States, Canada, and Denmark who have specialized in Eskimo
research.

Dr. Collins continued to serve as chairman of the directing commit-
tee of the Bibliography of Arctic Literature and the Roster of Arctic
Specialists, two projects that the Arctic Institute of North America
is carrying out under contract with the Office of Naval Research for
the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Defense
Research Board of Canada. He also participated in organizing the
forthcoming Alaska Science Conference to be held under the auspices
of the National Research Council in November 1950, serving as a
member of the steering committee and chairman of the social sciences
division.

During August Dr. William N. Fenton spent 2 weeks studying the
archives of the Ontario County Historical Society at Canandaigua,
N. Y. In August and September he made tape recordings in the
field at Tonawanda and Allegany Seneca reservations. In October
he completed a survey of Iroquois materials in the Massachusetts
Archives at the State House, in Boston, and found additional Pickering
letters in Salem. In December, 34 volumes of the printed journals
of the Continental Congress (1774-89) were surveyed and extracted
for Iroquois material. During March-May Dr. Fenton was detailed
to assist the Department of Justice in the preparation of a case for
the Court of Claims concerning Indian lands. In June he was detailed
to the Office of Indian Affairs on problems of tribal organization
among the Pueblos, the Klamath Indians of California, and the
Blackfeet of Montana. Dr. Fenton was in the field on this assign-
ment at the close of the fiscal year.

In September Dr. Gordon R. Willey, anthropologist of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, assumed the temporary duties of Acting
Director of the Institute of Social Anthropology for the remainder of
the fiscal year. However, research under Bureau auspices continued,
and preparation of various manuscripts was carried forward. He
continued the preparation of the manuscript ‘‘Prehistoric Settlement
Patterns in the Viri Valley of Northern Peru.’”’ Subsequently he
began studies on collections from the Canaveral and Ormond Beach
Mounds in east Florida, completing these studies in May. The
month of June was then devoted to rewriting and revising a manu-
script, ‘“HKarly Ancon and Early Supé: Chavin Horizon Sites of the
Central Coast of Pert.’”’ This report, approximating 125,000 words,
52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

was written in collaboration with Dr. John M. Corbett and will be
released by the Department of Anthropology, Columbia University.

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS
(Report prepared by Franx« H. H. Roserts, Jr.)

The River Basin Surveys were organized as a unit of the Bureau
of American Ethnology in the fall of 1945. Their purpose was to
carry into effect a memorandum of understanding between the Na-
tional Park Service and the Smithsonian Institution, which provides
for the salvage of archeological and paleontological remains occurring
in areas to be flooded or otherwise disturbed by the program of the
Federal Government for flood-control, irrigation, hydroelectric, and
navigation projects. The first actual field work was started in July
1946 and has continued since that date. Throughout the period of
operations, the investigations have been conducted in cooperation
with the National Park Service and the Bureau of Reclamation of
the Department of the Interior, the Corps of Engineers, Department
of the Army, and a number of nongovernmental institutions scattered
throughout various States. During the past fiscal year the work was
financed by a transfer of $215,886 to the Smithsonian Institution by
the National Park Service, derived in part from the National Park
Service and in part from the Bureau of Reclamation. The money
from the National Park Service was for use in areas outside of the
Missouri Basin, while that from the Bureau of Reclamation was for
work in the latter area. Because of the fact that the appropriations
for fiscal 1950 were made available so late in the summer, the neces-
sary funds could not be transferred to the Smithsonian Institution
until the period for field work had passed in many areas. Conse-
quently, less was accomplished than in previous years.

Activities during the year included reconnaissance or surveys for the
purpose of locating archeological sites or paleontological deposits that
will be involved in construction work or are in locations that eventually
will be flooded, and in the excavation of sites located by previous
surveys. The survey work covered 26 reservoirs located in 8 States
and scattered over 5 river basins. Excavations were completed or
under way at the end of the fiscal year in 13 reservoir areas in 9 States.
Three of the excavation projects were in areas where digging had been
done in previous years, while the remainder were new undertakings.
At the close of the fiscal year, the total of the reservoir areas, where
surveys had been made or excavations carried on since the beginning
of the program in July 1946, was 180 located in 23 States. Archeological
sites located and recorded have reached a total of 2,260, of which 484
have been recommended for excavation or additional testing. During
SECRETARY'S REPORT 53

the year preliminary appraisal reports were completed for all the
reservoirs surveyed, and 23 reports were mimeographed for limited
distribution to the cooperating agencies. This makes a total of 120
such reports issued since the start of the program. The excavations
made during fiscal 1950 bring the total for areas where such work has
been done to 21. Technical reports on the results of some of that work
have appeared in scientific journals, while the completed manuscripts
on others are now awaiting publication. Paleontological surveys have
been made in 100 reservoirs, 56 being those where archeological work
has also been done. The remaining 44 will eventually be visited by
archeological parties. Including the reservoir areas where archeo-
logical work remains to be done, the over-all total of reservoirs visited
is 224.

The distribution by States of all the reservoirs investigated for
archeological remains as of June 30, 1950, is as follows: California, 20;
Colorado, 23; Georgia, 3; Idaho, 10; Illinois, 2; Iowa, 3; Kansas, 6;
Louisiana, 1; Minnesota, 1; Montana, 5; Nebraska, 16; New Mexico,
1; North Dakota, 13; Ohio, 2; Oklahoma, 5; Oregon, 24; South Dakota,
9; Tennessee, 1; Texas, 13; Virginia, 1; Washington, 9; West Virginia,
2; Wyoming, 11. Excavations have thus far been made in: Cal-
ifornia, 1; Colorado, 1; Georgia, 1; Kansas, 1; Montana, 1; Nebraska,
1; New Mexico, 1; North Dakota, 2; Oklahoma, 1; Oregon, 1; South
Dakota, 2; Texas, 3; Virginia, 1; Washington, 3; and Wyoming, 1.

Throughout the fiscal year the River Basin Surveys received full
cooperation from the National Park Service, the Bureau of Reclama-
tion, and the Corps of Engineers, as well as various State agencies. At
some of the projects guides and transportation were furnished to staff
men in the field. At others, office and laboratory space was provided,
and in a number of cases labor and mechanical equipment were made
available by the construction agency. ‘The assistance provided made
possible a greater accomplishment than would otherwise have been
possible had it been necessary for the River Basin Surveys men to rely
on their own resources. The National Park Service was primarily
responsible for procuring the funds necessary for carrying on the pro-
gram and also served as the liaison between the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the other governmental agencies, not only in Washington but
through its several regional offices as well.

General supervision and direction of the work in California, Texas,
Louisiana, Georgia, Ohio, and Virginia were from the main office in
Washington. The Missouri Basin program was carried on under the
direction of a field headquarters and laboratory at Lincoln, Nebr., and
the activities in the Columbia Basin were supervised by a field office
located at Eugene, Oreg.
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

Washington office —The main headquarters of the River Basin Sur-
veys continued under the direction of Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
throughout the year. Joseph R. Caldwell, Carl F. Miller, and Ralph
S. Solecki, archeologists, were based at that office, although Mr.
Solecki did not work full time for the Surveys.

Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Miller left Washington on July 7 for Carters-
ville, Ga., where they started an excavation program within the area
to be flooded by the Allatoona Reservoir. Mr. Miller completed
part of the project early in December and returned to Washington,
while Mr. Caldwell continued digging until early in February, when
he went to Athens, Ga., to establish a field laboratory and study the
material obtained during the excavations. Facilities for the labora-
tory at Athens were provided by the University of Georgia. During
the first week in August Mr. Miller was temporarily detached from
the Allatoona investigations and sent to Louisiana to make a prelimi-
nary reconnaissance at the Bayou Bodcau Reservoir. Except for a
week in May when he visited archeological sites at Chester’s Island
and Floyd’s Island in the Okefenokee Swamp, Mr. Caldwell spent
the remainder of the fiscal year at Athens preparing his report, ‘A
Preliminary Report on Excavations in the Allatoona Reservoir,”
which was published in Early Georgia, vol. 1, No. 1, and a manuscript
pertaining to the Rembert Mounds on the Savannah River, which
will be published in the first volume of the River Basin Surveys
Papers.

After his return to Washington Mr. Miller devoted most of his time
to a study of the material and information he had obtained at the
Allatoona Reservoir and in the preparation of his portion of the report
on the project. He also served as assistant to the Director, and
during such times as the latter was absent from the office took charge
of the operations. In June he went to the Buggs Island Reservoir,
on the Roanoke River in southern Virginia, to excavate a large village
and burial site that was being destroyed by construction within the
area. During the year Mr. Miller completed and published five
manuscripts on his work in the Southeast.

Mr. Solecki, who had been transferred to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion’s staff the previous May to conduct an archeological reconnais-
sance in northern Alaska, returned to duty with the River Basin
Surveys on September 11. In November he proceeded to Ohio,
where he made a brief reconnaissance of the proposed Deer Creek and
Paint Creek Reservoirs in the Scioto Reservoir basin near Chillicothe.
During the remainder of the fiscal year be prepared a detailed report
on the excavation of the Natrium Mound, 10 miles north of New
Martinsville, W. Va., which he had dug during the winter of 1948-49.

California.—In May, Albert Mohr and J. Arthur Freed, field as-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 55

sistants, made surveys of the Burns, Bear, and Owens Reservoirs of
the Merced group, in the San Joaquin Valley. Nineteen sites were
located in the three projects, but as all of them are of little significance
no additional work has been recommended for them. In June, Mohr
and Freed made a survey at the Cachuma Reservoir on the Santa
Ynez River, near Santa Barbara. They located 18 sites and at the
end of the fiscal year Mohr was making preparations to dig a series of
test trenches in two of them.

Franklin Fenenga joined the River Basin Surveys as archeologist
on June 19 and initiated a series of excavations at the Terminus
Reservoir on the Kaweah River in the Central Valley. That area is
particularly important because it was at the boundary of the terri-
tories of the Wikchamni division of the Yokuts of the San Joaquin
Valley and of the Balwisha group of the Mono Indians. The archeo-
logical materials from the sites should provide important information
on the problem of cultural contact and diffusion between the different
tribes.

Columbia Basin.—Work in the Columbia Basin was continued
under the direction of the field headquarters at Eugene, Oreg., where
the University of Oregon provided laboratory and office space.
Douglas Osborne, acting field director, was in charge of the program
in that area until he resigned on September 3 to accept a position
with the University of Washington. Joel L. Shiner was appointed
to succeed him and continued as acting field director throughout the
remainder of the year.

During August excavations were carried on in the McNary Reser-
voir area, with Washington State College cooperating in the project.
Hight sites were tested or excavated on the south side of the Columbia
River between Umatilla Rapids and Techumtas Island, and in addi-
tion further work was done at one of the sites excavated during the
previous fiscal year. Survey reports had indicated that at two of
the locations there probably were remains beneath a layer of volcanic
ash. Digging there, however, failed to produce any evidence for such
an occupation. Information from other sites investigated demon-
strated that there were at least two cultural horizons along that
portion of the river. The data seem to indicate that the older in-
habitants made most of their implements of basalt while the later
ones used chalcedony for the most part. The economy of the two
groups appears to have been basically the same, although the earlier
was less complex than the later. This is indicated by greater de-
pendency on shellfish and a tendency toward sporadic occupation
and a wandering life.

During September Charles C. Case, Jr., and Robert C. Salisbury,

field assistants, surveyed 11 proposed reservoirs in the Willamette
922758—51——5
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

Valley, viz, Dexter, Hills Creek, Cougar, Blue River, Gate Creek,
Green Peter, Cascadia, Wiley Creek, Holly, Falls Creek, and White
Bridge. The Big Cliff, which had been surveyed by Osborne the
previous spring, was revisited. Probably because of the extreme
steepness of the terrain and the dense cover of timber, nothing of
archeological interest was found. It seems likely that the small
tributary canyons in which those reservoirs will be located were
never used by Indians except for temporary hunting and fishing
grounds.

From the Willamette area, Case and Salisbury proceeded to the
Heise-Roberts project on the Snake River in southeastern Idaho.
That project consists mainly of bank-control work and when com-
pleted will not flood any of the adjacent area. Careful examination
of the terrain to be disturbed by the construction work failed to reveal
any archeological remains, and so further work at that location will
not be necessary. From there the survey team went to the Crow
Creek Reservoir near the Idaho-Wyoming border. Careful search
of the area to be flooded by that project failed to reveal any archeo-
logical sites, and no further investigations will be required. From
Crow Creek, Case and Salisbury returned to the Post Reservoir,
which will be on the Crooked River, 10 miles east of the town of Post,
Oreg. That district was occupied at one time by small bands of the
northern Paiute, and since their economy was based on hunting and
gathering, they spent little time in any one spot. Consequently,
only three small camp sites were found in the area that will be flooded.
At all three the archeological materials were found to occur only on
the surface, and no further work has been recommended for that
reservoir.

During the fall and winter months Shiner processed the materials
from the McNary excavations and prepared the preliminary appraisal
reports on the results of the surveys. In collaboration with Douglas
Osborne, a preliminary report was written, giving the results of the
excavation program in the McNary Reservoir. In February, Mr.
Shiner, with a party of students from the University of Oregon,
excavated a small cave east of The Dalles where the relocation of a
highway was destroying archeological material. This project was in
cooperation with the University of Oregon, which provided the student
labor and assumed all the expenses of the project. An interesting
series of artifacts was obtained, showing a sequence of types for the
area.

In the early part of June Mr. Shiner made an inspection trip to the
Cascade Reservoir on the Payette River, Idaho, to determine the
condition of an archeological site where excavations were planned.
On his arrival there he found that the water in the reservoir had risen
SECRETARY’S REPORT 57

much more rapidly than contemplated and that there was no possibility
for archeological work. From the Cascade Reservoir he returned to
the McNary Reservoir to inspect the sites where work was to be done
during the summer field season.

Richard Daugherty joined the River Basin Surveys staff as arche
ologist on June 12 and proceeded to the O’Sullivan Reservoir, near
Moses Lake, Wash. Excavations were carried on at the O’Sullivan
Reservoir in the summer of 1948 by Mr. Daugherty and the investi-
gations this year were a continuation of the previous program. Daugh-
erty began work in a village site and at the close of the fiscal year had
excavated the remains of several pit houses and accompanying midden
deposits.

Douglas Osborne rejoined the River Basin Surveys on June 15 as
a consulting archeologist and took charge of the general excavation
program in the Columbia Basin. He proceeded with George Cheney
and S. J. Tobin, who joined the Surveys on June 16 as archeologists,
and their parties to the Chief Joseph and Equalizing Reservoirs in
Washington. Cheney began work at the Chief Joseph Reservoir on
June 19 and from then until the close of the fiscal year was occupied
in the excavation of village sites. Tobin’s party at the Equalizing
Reservoir began the excavation of a large cave on the same date. The
cave, although its floor was littered with huge blocks that had fallen
from the ceiling, gave evidence of considerable occupation, and numer-
ous specimens of netting, cordage, basketry, and other perishable
material were found there. Osborne returned to Eugene, and then
proceeded with a party to the McNary Reservoir, where he began a
series of excavations in sites lying farther upstream from those investi-
gated during previous seasons. At the close of the fiscal year his
party was busy digging house pits and midden deposits.

A survey party consisting of George Coale, Stewart Peck, and
Charles Farrell began a reconnaissance of the John Day Reservoir on
the Columbia River June 27 and at the close of the fiscal year had
located a number of important sites.

Georgia.—The bulk of the work done in Georgia was at the Allatoona
Reservoir on the Etowah River, near Cartersville. During the period
from July to February, Joseph R. Caldwell excavated 6 sites and
tested 10 others. From July to December, Carl F. Miller excavated
5 sites and tested 9 others. As a result of the investigations, it is
now possible to outline a new sequence of cultural stages in the
Etowah River area. At least 10, and probably 11, different periods
were identified, extending from the historic Cherokee of about 1755
back to a pre-pottery period when the people depended for the most
part on hunting and food gathering for their sustenance. The various
periods as outlined on the basis of the investigations have been named
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

Galt, which is that of the historic Cherokee; Brewster and Lamar,
which probably represent Creek occupation; Savannah and Etowah,
which pertain to the same basic Muskogean stock but have not been
identified as to the specific tribes; and the Woodstock period, which
has not yet been correlated with any specific peoples but which is
significant because it was characterized by a fortified village having
circular palisades with towers and is the first where there is evidence
for the growing of corn. The preceding period has been designated
the Cartersville and is identified by a distinctive type of stamped
pottery decoration and indications that the people had become at
least semisedentary. The next preceding period was one represented
by a site excavated by Mr. Miller but was not found by Mr. Caldwell,
who did not include it in his sequence. Mr. Miller has tentatively
designated the period as the Acworth. It was represented by the
remains of a village containing some 60 round structures of varying
sizes. Definite indications of Hopewellian influences were found in
this horizon. The pottery was a plain, well-polished ware that
preceded the introduction of stamped wares in the area. The next
period recognized by both Caldwell and Miller is one designated
the Kellogg. It was characterized by a semisedentary hunting and
gathering culture. There was great use of storage pits, and a variety
of acorns and nuts were recovered from them. Apparently it was
during this period that the bow and arrow appeared in the Allatoona
region. Antedating the Kellogg was a period called Stallings, which
is represented only by scattered finds of potsherds from a fiber-
tempered pottery. The oldest of the sequence, which tentatively has
been designated pre-pottery, preceded the Stallings. The pre-pottery
stage may represent several periods and cover a long duration of time.
During that stage of the occupation of the area, the people had no
pottery, no pipes, no agriculture, and possibly no houses. At least
no evidence was found indicating any type of structure. The economy
was basically hunting and gathering, and the chief weapon probably
was a javelin hurled with a spear thrower.

Lowisiana.—The only work done in Louisiana during the fiscal year
consisted of the reconnaissance made by Carl F. Miller at the Bayou
Bodcau project on the Red River, northeast of Shreveport. He found
that although there are archeological remains in that district, none of
them occur in the area to be involved by the work of the Corps of
Engineers.

Missouri Basin.—As in previous years, the program in the Missouri
Basin was supervised and directed from the field headquarters at the
University of Nebraska, in Lincoln. From July 1 until the end of
December, Dr. Waldo R. Wedel was in charge of the program. His
promotion to the position of curator of the division of archeology,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 59

United States National Museum, made it necessary for him to with-
draw from the River Basin Surveys activities, and on January 23
Paul L. Cooper was designated as acting field director.

Delay in the passage of the 1950 appropriation bill greatly reduced
field work in the Missouri Basin during the summer of 1949 and
prevented completion of the program originally set up for the fiscal
year. However, it was possible to make surveys at the Onion Flat,
Soral Creek, and Raft Lake Reservoirs in the Big Horn River basin
in Wyoming during July, and to initiate an excavation program in the
Angostura Reservoir in South Dakota. Nothing of archeological
significance was noted in the three reservoirs, and no further work is
recommended for them.

The investigations at the Angostura Reservoir continued from
early in July until November and were resumed in May. Though
the final results of the excavations will not be known until it is possible
to study all the materials obtained, it may be said that the sites where
digging was done represent a number of different cultures, most of
them indicating pre-pottery-making peoples. At two of them,
however, evidence was obtained of two different pottery-making
groups. At one of the sites the occupation level was so deeply buried
that it was necessary to use a bulldozer to remove the sterile over-
burden. Material from that particular site indicates a period of
considerable antiquity. Tentative correlations suggest that it
probably is comparable in age to some of the so-called Yuma remains
in other parts of the Plains area.

Other field work accomplished during the 1949 season was an
18-day reconnaissance in the Oahe Reservoir area in South Dakota.
Preliminary surveys had been made there in previous years, but
during the reconnaissance in November more than 50 sites, many of
them previously unrecorded, were visited.

Active field work was resumed in June when a paleontological party
proceeded to the Angostura Reservoir, the Boysen and Anchor
Reservoirs in Wyoming, and the Canyon Ferry project in Montana.
Important fossils were recovered from the latter area. On June 7
excavations were started in the Garrison Reservoir in North Dakota,
in the Tiber Reservoir in Montana, and later in the month at the
Oahe project in South Dakota. All those activities were proceeding
satisfactorily at the end of the fiscal year.

During the fall and winter months considerable work was done in
the laboratory. Eight preliminary reports were written and mimeo-
graphed for distribution to the cooperating agencies. In all, 16,938
specimens collected from 146 sites in 16 reservoir areas were cleaned
and cataloged. Fifty-six maps were drawn and 1,318 negatives
processed. The negatives include field photographs, black-and-white
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

negatives of color transparencies, and laboratory photographs. Two
hundred and six transparencies were cataloged and filed; 78 enlarge-
ments were printed and mounted; and 1,782 black-and-white contact
prints were made, cataloged, and filed. More than 4,000 photo-
graphic copies of archeological records were made to bring the basic
record file up to date. A considerable number of animal bones taken
from archeological sites were identified and there was some restora-
tion of fragmentary pottery.

G. Ellis Burcaw joined the staff as an archeologist on May 31 and
left Lincoln on June 7 for the Garrison Reservoir in North Dakota,
where he began a series of excavations at the so-called Rock Village.
That site, one of the farthest upstream of the known fortified earth-
lodge villages, was yielding considerable quantities of artifacts, in-
cluding some European trade material, as work progressed at the
close of the fiscal year.

Karly in the fiscal year Paul L. Cooper devoted his time to studying
materials pertaining to the archeological remains in the Oahe and
Fort Randall Reservoirs. During September he made two brief
trips to the Angostura and Oahe Reservoirs and late in October
accompanied Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Director of the River
Basin Surveys, on a visit to the excavation projects at the Angostura
Reservoir and to inspect sites in other areas. During November he
made a reconnaissance along the east side of the Missouri River in
the Oahe Reservoir area. In December he accompanied Dr. Gordon
Baldwin, of the National Park Service, Dr. Carlyle Smith, of the
University of Kansas, and Wesley Hurt, of the University of South
Dakota, on a trip to the Fort Randall and Oahe Reservoirs in South
Dakota for the purpose of selecting sites for excavation by the Uni-
versities of Kansas and South Dakota during the summer of 1950.
On January 23, 1950, he was designated acting field director of the
River Basin Surveys, and thereafter his activities were mainly con-
cerned with planning and supervising the headquarters and field
activities of the organization.

Robert B. Cumming, Jr., archeologist, served throughout the year
as laboratory supervisor at the Lincoln headquarters. During such
time as the acting director was absent from the office, he assumed
administrative responsibility for continuing its operations. In addi-
tion he carried on research work on the skeletal material from the
Medicine Creek and Harlan County Reservoirs and prepared an ap-
pendix on the skeletal remains from the Woodruff ossuary for the
technical report on the ossuary. He also did some work on the human
remains from ossuaries in Nebraska.

Walter D. Enger, Jr., archeologist, joined the River Basin Surveys
staff on May 31 and left Lincoln on June 9 to begin the excavation of
SECRETARY’S REPORT 61

sites to be flooded by the proposed Tiber Reservoir on the Marias
River in Montana. Previous surveys in that area had shown three
types of sites, consisting of buried occupational levels exposed along
the edges of the river terraces, surface sites on the river terraces, and
tipi-ring sites on top of the plateau surrounding the reservoir. Be-
cause of the nature of the cultures represented, the artifact yield and
the work accomplished before the end of the fiscal year was small,
but considerable information was being obtained about the sequence
of cultures and the general aboriginal characteristics of the area.

Jack T. Hughes, archeologist, left Lincoln on July 7 and proceeded
to the Angostura Reservoir in South Dakota, where he initiated a
series of excavations. Hughes continued in charge of that project
until September when he resigned from the River Basin Surveys to
return to Columbia University for further academic work. Mr.
Hughes prepared a report on the results of the Angostura work ob-
tained while he was in charge of the field party.

Donald J. Lehmer, Jr., archeologist, joined the Missouri Basin
staff on June 1. He left Lincoln on June 9 with G. Ellis Burcaw and
proceeded with him to the Tiber project where he assisted in estab-
lishing headquarters. From there he returned to Pierre, S. Dak.,
and on June 19 began the excavation of a stratified earth-lodge village
in the area of the Oahe Dam approach channel. By the end of the
fiscal year his party had identified house remains attributable to both
the Arikara and the Mandan.

George Metcalf, field and laboratory assistant, spent the period
from July 22, 1949, to November 7, 1949, with the field party at the
Angostura Reservoir. During the fall and winter months he assisted
in the analysis of the material from the Medicine Creek Reservoir and
in the preparation of the report for the excavations made there during
the previous fiscal year. He also made a study of ceramic materials
from Upper Republican sites which are in the collections of the
Nebraska State Historical Society at Lincoln. Metcalf left Lincoln
on May 19 with the Wheeler party and at the close of the fiscal year
was working at the Angostura Reservoir.

Robert L. Shalkop joined the staff as an archeologist on June 28,
and at the end of the fiscal year was preparing to leave with a recon-
naissance party to survey a number of reservoir projects in Montana
and Wyoming.

James M. Shippee, field and laboratory assistant, was a member
of the field party at the Angostura Reservoir from early in July until
early in November. During the fall and winter months he devoted
considerable time to the restoration of pottery vessels and the process-
ing of other specimens from the Angostura excavations. During the
spring months most of his time was occupied in the preparation of
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

field equipment to be used by the various parties during the summer
months.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Richard P. Wheeler, archeologist,
was engaged in preliminary archeological surveys of the Onion Flat,
Soral Creek, and Raft Lake Reservoirs, in the Big Horn River basin,
Fremont County, Wyo. He returned to the Lincoln headquarters
on July 11 and spent the time from then until the middle of August
preparing reports on the reservoir areas examined over the period
in which his party had been in the field. In August he joined the
Angostura field party and after the departure of Mr. Hughes took
full charge of the operations. From September 4 to November 7,
Wheeler and his crew partially excavated or tested and mapped11
sites. He returned to Lincoln in November and devoted the time
from then until the middle of April in analyzing artifacts, supervising
the drawing of site maps and profiles, and preparing an outline and
notes for the final report on the Angostura investigations. On April
19 be made a 5-day trip to the Angostura Reservoir to make plans
for the excavations for the coming season. One month later he
returned to the Angostura Reservoir with a field party and from then
until the end of the fiscal year he excavated and tested two sites and
supervised the removal of overburden with a bulldozer at two areas
at a third site. The use of mechanized equipment in this particular
instance was made necessary by the fact that the occupation level
occurs beneath from 9 to 10 feet of sterile deposits, and there was not
sufficient time to remove them by the usual hand methods. The
materials found in the deeply buried level indicate an early hunting
culture.

Dr. Theodore E. White, paleontologist, spent the early months of
the fiscal year in the laboratory at Lincoln identifying osteological
material obtained from archeological sites and in preparing a report
on the physiography of the Angostura Reservoir. He worked in
Texas in November and December. In January he wastransferred
to the Smithsonian Institution staff and was sent to Panamdé. He
returned to duty with the River Basin Surveys in May. He left the
Lincoln headquarters on June 15 and proceeded to the Boysen Reser-
voir area in Wyoming, where he prospected for vertebrate fossils
until June 15. He then moved on to the Anchor Reservoir area
where he prospected the Upper Permian and Lower Triassic deposits.
On June 21 he moved to the Canyon Ferry Reservoir area in Montana,
and spent the time prospecting the Oligocene and Miocene deposits.
Two of the Oligocene localities produced abundant specimens, mostly
small mammals, while three new localities were discovered in the
Miocene deposits. Material obtained from two of the new localities
definitely establishes the presence of both Lower and Middle Miocene
SECRETARY’S REPORT 63

deposits in the area. During the course of this work, Dr. White was
assisted by Prentiss Shepherd, Jr., a student at Harvard University,
and William C. Harrup, Jr., a student at Columbia University.

Ohio.—Field work in Ohio was restricted to brief visits to the
proposed Deer Creek and Paint Creek Reservoirs on two tributaries
of the Scioto River, near Chillicothe. Mr. Solecki, of the River
Basin Surveys, went to Ohio in November and, in company with
Clyde B. King, superintendent of Mound City National Monument,
and Raymond Baby, archeologist of the Ohio State Archeological
and Historical Society, Columbus, determined that no sites of archeo-
logical significance would be inundated by the proposed reservoirs.
During the course of the reconnaissance, Mr. Solecki examined three
features on Deer Creek and two nearby on Spruce Hill, which were
purported to be Norse iron furnaces, but was unable to find anything
that could be construed as conclusive proof that the remains repre-
sented ancient iron furnaces. The opinion was that the features
probably had been lime kilns dating from the early Colonial period
in the area.

Texas.—The River Basin Surveys in Texas continued to operate
from the base and headquarters furnished by the Department of
Anthropology of the University of Texas at Austin. Surveys were
begun and completed at the Belton Reservoir on the Leon River, at
the Canyon Reservoir on the Guadalupe River, and at the Texarkana
Reservoir on the Sulphur River, near the town of Texarkana. The
work at the Belton Reservoir resulted in the location of 43 archeo-
logical sites. Five of them were found to lie outside the reservoir
area. ‘Twelve of the remaining are rock-shelter sites, 12 are open
occupational areas, and 4 are a combination of the two forms. The
remainder consist either of burned rock middens or deeply buried
middens. Testing was done in five sites, and a number of interesting
artifacts were recovered. However, it was discovered that during
the course of the years most of the sites in the area had been looted
by commercial collectors and so little remains that further investi-
gations are not warranted. Such evidence as was found during the
reconnaissance and testing indicated that the Belton district probably
was occupied by people of the Round Rock focus over a period of
many centuries.

At the Canyon Reservoir, 20 archeological sites were located and
recorded. Five of them are large open sites, 3 are small rock shel-
ters, 1 is a deeply buried occupation level, 1 is a subterranean cavern,
and the remaining 10 are small open sites containing a single burned
rock midden in each. The area is one from which only meager archeo-
logical information is available and for that reason 8 of the sites have
been recommended for excavation and complete analysis.
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

The Texarkana reconnaissance resulted in the location of 50 arche-
ological sites, all of which are open occupational areas. At three of
them there are small artificial mounds of the variety which has been
called ‘Capped Ridge.”’ Ten of the sites appear to belong to a non-
pottery horizon, probably the Balcones phase. Seventeen are large
village areas characterized by potsherds and appear to range in time
from Early Gibson Aspect to Middle Fulton Aspect. At least two
sites are related to the Coles Creek culture. The remainder are small
sites of indeterminate affiliation. Of the total, 16 sites have been
recommended for extensive excavation and analysis.

Excavations were carried on at the Whitney Reservoir from March
6 to June 18. During that period five Indian sites—three rock-
shelter and two open sites—were extensively excavated and two
historic sites were studied and recorded. One shelter called Picto-
graph Cave contained material from two different periods, the first
probably dating before A. D. 1200 and the second sometime subse-
quent to that date but pre-Columbian. ‘The early occupation is com-
parable in many respects to the Round Rock focus in Texas, while
the second has not yet been correlated with other remains. The
data obtained from the shelter give interesting information pertaining
to changes in diet and population density during the two periods of
occupation. The second, known as Buzzard Shelter, is not far from
the first, and also gave evidence of an early occupation in the lower
depths of the fill. The later occupation in the shelter suggests certain
similarities to that of the Toyah focus. While there is considerable
similarity between the cultural sequence found in the two shelters,
there are specific differences in artifact types and stratigraphic pro-
portions. The third shelter, known locally as Sheep Cave, is the
largest of the three, and the material from it agrees in the main with
that from the other two. Five flexed burials were found there, how-
ever, and study of the physical type represented should throw some
light on the relationships of the people.

Three weeks were spent in the excavation of a small occupational
area on the second terrace of the Brazos River at the Steele site.
The evidence of occupation on the surface covers about an acre in
extent and it is underlain by an unknown number of occupational
levels of considerably greater extent. Traces of occupation extend
to a depth of at least 15 feet, and it will be necessary to use mechanical
equipment to excavate a deep trench in order to make stratigraphic
studies. The site appears to be a significant one in that the most
recent occupation was prior to the advent of pottery and the bow and
arrow in that area.

The Stansbury site, the location of a historic Indian village, was the
fifth area excavated. Material from it includes trade items of French,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 65

English, and American origin. The occupation probably began in
the mid-eighteenth century, or perhaps somewhat earlier, and lasted
until 1869. House patterns with compact floor, post holes, central
fire hearth, and bell-shaped cache pits were found. In general, it
may be said that the site shows relationship with Taovayas site of
Spanish Fort. It is located near the site of Towash Village, one of the
historic sites studied. This village was an early white settlement dat-
ing from the 1840’s to the present time. The first dam and bridge on
the Brazos River were located there, and their remains, as well as those
of the old stone store and church, are still to be seen. Measurements
and photographs were taken in order to make scale drawings of the
buildings.

The other historic site studied was that of Fort Graham, a frontier
post dating 1849-54. The outlines of one of the buildings, as well as
several other features, were located. It also was determined that the
“Village of the Caddoes,” visited by Ferdinand Roemer in 1846, was
situated at the site of Fort Graham.

Excavations got under way at the Lavon Reservoir on June 19 in
the Hogge Bridge site, one of 11 situated along the east fork of the
Trinity River. Each of the sites contains a large circular pit, which
is a feature peculiar to the area. Digging was started in one of the
large pits in order to determine what their purpose may have been.
By the end of the fiscal year, the southwestern quarter of the pit in
the Hogge Bridge site had been cleared and the original surface un-
covered. The pit was 10 feet deep, 65 feet in diameter on the inside,
and had a rim of dirt from the original excavation piled around the
periphery measuring 90 feet from crest to crest. The floor proved to
be concave, and no post holes or evidences of a structure had been
found by the end of the year. Along the east rim of the pit was a bur-
ial area, and on the inner slope of the south side of the pit a bear burial
was uncovered. Potsherds indicate that the site probably dates be-
tween A. D. 1200 and 1500, but its cultural affiliations had not yet
been determined.

During November and December Dr. Theodore E. White prospected
the Upper Cretaceous deposits in the Lavon Reservoir for vertebrate
fossils. A number of specimens were located, but time permitted the
removal of only two. One consisted of a small mosasaur (unident)
skull and the skull of a large mosasaur (Tylosaurus?).

During the time when he was not in the field, Robert L. Stephenson,
archeologist, prepared reports on the various surveys which he had
made and processed the specimens in the laboratory at Austin. In
November he attended the Seventh Conference for Plains Archeology
and presented a paper on the work he had been doing in Texas. In
May he attended the meetings of the Society for American Archaeology
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

at Norman, Okla., and took part in the discussions held there. At the
close of the fiscal year he was occupied with the excavations at the
Lavon Reservoir.

Edward B. Jelks was appointed temporary assistant at the labora-
tory in October and in February was made assistant field archeologist.
He helped Mr. Stephenson in the processing of specimens until March
6, when he proceeded with the party to the Whitney Reservoir and
assisted in the excavation program throughout the course of the work.
During such times as Mr. Stephenson was not with the party, Mr.
Jelks was in full charge. On June 12 he was appointed archeologist
and proceeded to the Lavon Reservoir, where he was at work at the
end of the fiscal year.

Cooperating institutions.—As in previous years, numerous State and
local institutions cooperated with the River Basin Surveys. Space for
field offices and laboratories for units of the Surveys were provided by
the Universities of Georgia, Nebraska, Oregon, and Texas. The
Universities of Oregon and Washington and Washington State College
joined forces with the Surveys both in reconnaissance work and in
excavations at the McNary, O’Sullivan, Equalizing, and Chief Joseph
Reservoirs in the Columbia Basin, while the University of Georgia took
over the responsibility for the excavation of one large site in the
Allatoona Reservoir in Georgia, and for a series of surveys as well as
excavations along the Flint River in the southern part of that State.
The University of Missouri and the Missouri Archeological Society
continued their cooperation in making surveys in a number of proposed
reservoir areas and in conducting some excavations. During the
early months of the fiscal year, the Museum of Natural History of the
University of Kansas, the Laboratory of Anthropology of the Univer-
sity of Nebraska, the State Museum of the University of Nebraska,
and the Nebraska State Historical Society continued excavation
projects that had been started toward the close of the preceding year.
The University of Oklahoma continued work in the Fort Gibson
Reservoir in the summer of 1949, and in June of 1950 returned to the
area for further work.

Late in the fiscal year a program developed by the National Park
Service, whereby various scientific agencies would carry on salvage
work in proposed reservoir areas, got under way. On the basis of
agreements between the National Park Service and the agencies
concerned, certain funds were made available to the latter to help
cover the expense of the investigations. The River Basin Surveys
participated in that program in a consultative capacity only. The
final results of the work accomplished, however, will be correlated with
those of the Surveys,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 67

INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY

(Report prepared by Gorpon R. WILEY)

General statement.—The objectives of the Institute of Social Anthro-
pology are anthropological research on the community life of rural
peoples of Latin America and the training of Latin American nationals
in the methods and principles of modern social anthropology. The aim
is to inform both the social scientist and layman in the United States
concerning little-known peoples of other parts of the world and to
build up in various Latin American countries a corps of professionally
trained scientists and friends.

During the past year the Institute was financed by transfers of funds
from the Department of State, totaling $82,510, from the appropria-
tion “International Information and Education Activities, 1950.”
As in the previous year, long-term planning has been done on a very
tentative basis because of budget uncertainties for the future. Early
in the fiscal year reorganizations in Department of State technical-
aid-type programs called for a reappraisal of the Institute’s goals and
programs. With the Point LV foreign aid scheduled to take the place
of many of the projects of the former Committee for Scientific and
Cultural Cooperation, the question was raised as to whether the work
of the Institute should come within this new organizational frame-
work. The decision of the Institute, in keeping with the general
policy of the Smithsonian Institution, was that the Institute should
continue with basic research and teaching and not enter directly into
the field of applied social science. Nevertheless, the Institute,
through the office of the Director, served in an informal consultative
capacity to the Program Analysis and Reports Branch of the Inter-
departmental Committee and to the Point IV successor of this
committee. Such consultation has included recommendations for
anthropological aid and personnel for Point IV work, conferences with
the representatives of other governmental agencies considering
technical assistance programs, and informal memoranda from our
field representatives on features of local native life that provide a
background for economic development programs.

The regular assignments and program of the Institute continued as
formerly in the Washington office, and in the field stations in Brazil,
Colombia, México, and Pert.

Washington office—Dr. George M. Foster, Director, served from
July 1 until September 3, assuming leave status at the end of this
period to conduct privately sponsored research in Spain. Although
these investigations in Spain are not officially connected with the
Institute of Social Anthropology program, they bear directly upon it
scientifically in view of the close historical relationships between Spain
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

and Latin America. Dr. Gordon R. Willey, on loan from the Bureau
of American Ethnology, was Acting Director for the remainder of the
year. Miss Lois C. Northcott, formerly secretary to the Director,
became administrative assistant in November 1949.

Upon the recommendation of the Director, Dr. José M. Cruxent,
Director of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales, Caracas, Venezuela,
visited the United States on a Department of State grant-in-aid. He
remained during August and September, traveling within this country
to various museums and universities.

In February, Dr. Willey began an extended tour of Institute field
posts and, en route, visited other Latin-American countries to renew
professonal contacts and to discuss scientific and local academic
problems with Latim-American colleagues. Mexico City, Guatemala
City, Panamé, Bogotdé, Quito, Lima, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Caracas were included on this trip.

Brazil.—Drs. Donald Pierson, sociologist, and Kalervo Oberg,
social anthropologist, continued their research and teaching activities
in cooperation with the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Politica in Sao
Paulo. Dr. Pierson, after a 2-months’ consultation in the United
States, assumed duties in the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Politica as
dean of the graduate section. In connection with these duties he
trained graduate students in problems of academic administration.
In addition he taught courses in sociology and social anthropology,
supervised masters theses in social anthropology, and was engaged in
writing and preparing manuscripts in social anthropology and soci-
ology. In April Dr. Pierson represented the Smithsonian Institution
at Brazil’s National Indian Week celebrations in Rio de Janeiro.
at the request of the Brazilian Embassy. During May and June,
Dr. Pierson, accompanied by graduate students, undertook an in-
tensive social anthropological survey of the large and important Sao
Francisco River Valley. This field work was sponsored by the
federal government of Brazil as well as by the Institute of Social
Anthropology. A survey report is anticipated that will be of par-
ticular interest for the Brazilian Government’s economic development
plans for the Sao Francisco Valley.

Dr. Kalervo Oberg, accompanied by a student assistant, spent the
months of July and August in the northwestern Mato Grosso among
the Nambicuara, Iranxe, and other Indian groups. These tribes,
some of the most primitive in the world, lead a completely isolated
life, and there is very little scientific literature on them. He returned
to Sao Paulo late in August and resumed teaching, devoting his re-
search time to the preparation of a manuscript on the Mato Grosso
field work. Dr. Oberg delivered the address at the Escola Livre de
SECRETARY’S REPORT 69

Sociologia e Politica for the commencement exercises held in March.
He spent May and June in the United States on consultation.

Colombia.—In Colombia, Dr. Raymond E. Crist, cultural geog-
rapher on leave from the University of Maryland, represented the
Institute at the Universidad del Cauca, Popayan. For the past year
Dr. Crist was in Colombia only for the months of July through August,
returning to the United States in September. During this stay,
which was a continuation of an appointment made in 1949, Dr. Crist
and a group of Colombian scientists and graduate students made a
survey trip into the western section of the Department of Cauca for
the purpose of studying land utilization and agricultural and animal-
husbandry techniques. In August he accompanied Dr. A. C. White-
ford of Beloit University on a field trip among the Guambiano In-
dians, and shortly thereafter he visited the lower Eastern Cordillera
on a geographic survey. Dr. Crist was especially cited to the Secre-
tary of State by the assistant public affairs officer in Bogoté for the
professional and personal success of his stay in Colombia.

Meéxico.—Dr. Isabel T. Kelly, Institute representative assigned to
the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico City, divided her
time between teaching and the writing of the first volume of an
ethnography of the Totonac Indians. This work was completed in
March, and since then Dr. Kelly has continued with preparation of
the second volume. She also carried on a research seminar for Mex-
ican graduate students in the writing and general preparation of
scientific monographs.

The United States-sponsored Benjamin Franklin Library in Mexico
City exhibited some 80 photographs taken by Dr. Kelly during her
work among the Totonac Indians, and these photographs were later
borrowed by the Mexican Government for displays in Jalapa, Monter-
rey, Morelia, and Oaxaca. Dr. Kelly’s activities have been favorably
publicized by a feature article released in the Mexican popular weekly
magazine Nosotros.

In connection with the Washington office’s attempt to demonstrate
the utility of anthropology for the Point IV type of economic devel-
opment program, Dr. Kelly prepared an analysis of possibilities for
public housing in the tropical coastal area of the Gulf of Mexico. This
was written from the point of view of the native cultures involved,
with which Dr. Kelly is expertly familiar, and points up the conflicts
and difficulties to be overcome in implanting technological ideas on
alien societies. During September Dr. Kelly was in the United
States for consultation.

Perti.—The 1950 year opened with Dr. George A. Kubler, on leave
from Yale University, as the Institute’s representative attached to the
Peruvian Instituto de Estudios Etnolégicos in Lima. Dr. Kubler, an
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

authority on the Colonial Period in Pert, continued with his research
on archival material in the Department of La Libertad, Trujillo, as
well as in the Lima archives. Consultation with students in anthro-
pology and history was also maintained. Dr. Kubler returned to the
United States in September. A manuscript covering a part of Dr.
Kubler’s work in Pert, ‘““The Indian Caste of Perti, 1795-1950,” an
analysis of population and racial attitudes, was submitted for publica-
tion in April.

Ozzie G. Simmons, current representative in Pert, arrived in Lima
in November. Mr. Simmons offered a course on American ethnic
groups and acculturation in the Peruvian Instituto de Estudios
Etnolégicos and began field investigations at the town of Lunahuand.
Studies at this community, initiated in February with the aid of a
student assistant, have run throughout the year and will extend into
1951. Coincident with this research Mr. Simmons is collaborating in
a seminar on social anthropological field methods. He has also aided
in a questionnaire project conducted by the Peruvian National School
of Social Work among groups of highland Indians who have recently
moved to the vicinity of Lima in response to industrial opportunities.
Quite importantly, he has been instrumental in advising the Peruvian
Ministry of Public Health to add a Peruvian social anthropologist to
their staff for work in the Department of Ica. This has created an
excellent job opportunity for a Peruvian trained by us and has shown
the way for further employment of our trainees in governmental
departments.

ARCHIVES

The largest collection of Indian photographs acquired by the
Bureau in many years was obtained during the past year when the
Library of Congress gave permission to copy pictures submitted long
ago for copyright purposes. These pictures, made more than 50
years ago, show many famous Indians whose portraits are new to the
collections. Another group of 50 rare Indian photographs was re-
ceived from Eddie Herman, a Sioux Indian of Hot Springs, S. Dak.

The manuscript material in the archives of the Bureau has been
used by research workers both by personal visits for consultation and
by correspondence.

A new manuscript of 2,380 pages, in the Fox Indian language,
consisting of a vocabulary, with grammatical and linguistic notes,
was donated to the Bureau by Miss Ella A. Merritt of Washington.
This work was compiled by the late James Brannin, formerly connected
with the United States Navy during the time (1935-42) he was
stationed near the Fox Indians in Wisconsin.

Ethnology.

During the year information was furnished by members of the
Bureau staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the American
Indians, past and present, of both continents. The increased number
of requests from teachers of primary and secondary grades and from
Scout organizations indicates a rapidly growing interest in the American
Indian throughout the country. Various specimens sent to the
Bureau were identified and data on them furnished for their owners.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1950:

The Smithsonian Institution is the official United States agency for
the exchange with other nations of governmental, scientific, and
literary publications. The International Exchange Service, initiated
by the Smithsonian Institution in the early years of its existence for
the interchange of scientific publications between learned societies
and individuals in the United States and those of foreign countries,
serves as a means of developing and executing in part the broad and
comprehensive object, ‘the diffusion of knowledge.” It was later
designated by the United States Government as the agency for the
transmission of official documents to selected depositories throughout
the world, and it continues to execute the exchanges pursuant to
conventions, treaties, and other international agreements.

The number of packages received for transmission during the year
was 1,009,675, an increase over the previous year of 169,550 packages,
or approximately 20 percent. The weight of the packages was
832,087 pounds, an increase of 35,387 pounds, or approximately 4.4
percent. It was only through the installation and utilization of labor-
saving devices that the International Exchange Service was able to
process the additional number of packages without increased personnel.

The average weight of the individual package decreased to approxi-
mately 13 ounces as compared with the average of 15 ounces for the
fiscal year of 1949. This indicates that the majority of the publica-
tions now being transmitted are current publications rather than accu-
mulated publications. A further reason for the reduction in the
average weight of the individual package is to be found in the fact
that more of the departments of the United States Government are
using the International Exchange Service for the transmission of their
periodical publications. The publications received from both the

foreign and domestic sources for shipment are classified as shown in

The packages of publications are forwarded by freight to the
exchange bureaus of foreign countries and to addressees in foreign
countries where shipment by such means is impractical by direct
mail. ‘The number of boxes shipped to the foreign exchange bureaus
was 2,889, a decrease of 407 boxes from the previous year. Of the
boxes shipped 841 were for depositories of full sets of United States
Government documents, these publications being furnished in ex-
change for the official publications of foreign governments for deposit
in the Library of Congress. The number of packages forwarded by
mail and means other than freight was 219,471.

In spite of the fact that considerable savings in transportation
continued to be effected by exporting through Baltimore rather than
New York, and in spite of the advantage gained through special
arrangements for shipment to Germany, the allotment for transporta-
tion was insufficient to maintain full operations for the entire year.
Owing to the insufficient funds and to the fact that no shipments
were made to China or Rumania, the International Exchange Service
ended the fiscal year with a backlog of 145,224 pounds of publications.

Consignments are now forwarded to all countries except China and
Rumania. Publications for addressees in Formosa, formerly sent
through the Chinese Exchange Bureau, are now forwarded by direct
mail,

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official publications received
by the Exchange Service to be sent abroad in return for the official
publications sent by foreign governments for deposit in the Library
of Congress is 99 (59 full and 40 partial sets). Changes that occurred
during the year are shown in the footnotes.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: Transmitted herewith is a report on the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1950.

The value of the collection was enhanced by the acquisition of
specimens that have not hitherto been on exhibition or that are
rarities. As the Zoo is a combined educational, recreational, and
research institution, the addition of new kinds of animals is of marked
benefit. At the close of the year the personnel had been recruited to
almost its authorized strength, and the rate of personnel turn-over
had declined. Such good progress had been made in repair work
that the general condition is definitely better than it has been for
several years.

The National Zoological Park continues to do its utmost to further
the expressed purpose of the Smithsonian Institution, ‘‘the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men,” by constantly rendering a
wide variety of ‘services in addition to maintaining the exhibits.
Valuable opportunities for research are afforded students of biology,
particularly vertebrate zoology, as well as artists, photographers, and
writers, utilizing only methods of study that do not endanger the
welfare of the animals or of the public. Other services are answering
in person, and by phone, mail, and telegraph, questions regarding
animals and their care and transportation; furnishing information to
other zoos and private and public agencies regarding structures for
keeping and housing animals; cooperation with other agencies of the
Federal, State, and municipal governments in research work; and
preparation of articles for publication.

THE EXHIBITS

Specimens for exhibition are acquired by gift, deposit, purchase,
exchange, births, and hatchings and are removed by death, exchange,
or return of those on deposit. Although depositors are at liberty to
remove their specimens, many leave them permanently.

As in any colony of living things, there is a steady turn-over, and
so the exhibits are constantly changing. Thus, the inventory list of
specimens in the collection on June 30 of each year does not show all
the kinds of animals that were exhibited during the year; sometimes

82
SECRETARY’S REPORT 83

creatures of outstanding interest at the time they were shown are no
longer in the collection at the time the list is prepared.

ACCESSIONS
GIFTS

Many valuable additions to the collections were made by gifts
during the past year.

The Government of India, through Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru and the Embassy of India in Washington, presented a pair of
baby elephants. These were captured in Mysore and sent from
Bombay to the States with a young Indian mahout, Baba Jan, in
charge. The Isthmian Steamship Co. furnished free transportation
for the elephants and a return passage for Baba Jan. They were
officially presented by Madam Vijayalakshmi Pandit, Ambassador to
the United States from India, through Assistant Secretary of State
George C. McGhee, in the presence of some 70,000 people. Ashok,
named after an ancient Indian emperor known for his peaceful reign,
was about a year old. Shanti, an Indian word meaning peace (and
also a girl’s name), was about 2 years old. They adapted themselves
immediately to life at the Zoo and are two much-admired animals.

The U. S. National Park Service captured and sent three grizzly
bears, which were especially desirable additions inasmuch as the Zoo
has had none for many years. Grizzlies are now so scarce that they
are highly prized, and the courtesy of the National Park Service in
supplying them is much appreciated. These three were removed
from Yellowstone Park because they threatened to become a menace
to visitors; otherwise they would not have been disturbed.

A number of shipments were received from members of the Armed
Forces who had been abroad; many of them came from Malaya,
where they were collected by Maj. Robert Traub, of the Army Med-
ical Department, Research and Graduate School. Outstanding
among the rare and interesting creatures are two pencil-tailed tree
mice, a species seldom seen in captivity.

Miss Alice Birney Robert, Washington, D. C., presented a great
gray kangaroo that her father obtained while in Australia.

The American Veterans Association presented ‘“‘Amvet,’”’ an unus-
ually fine lion cub, which promises to become a splendid adult.

Roy Humbert, of Eustis, Fla., sent four giant anolis lizards from
Cuba.

Capt. Hugh L. Keegan, of the United States Army Medical Corps,
sent a number of Philippine species, including two elephant trunk
snakes, a tangalunga, a Philippine palm civet, and a slender-tailed
cloud rat (Phloeomys cumingi).
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service continued sending valuable
animals, including a Steller’s sea lion from St. Paul Island, Alaska.

J. D. Handman, of Nyasaland, Africa, in making shipments of
animals ordered from him, has in each case put in one or two extra
creatures as gifts. The specimens are from a region not well known
zoologically, and so all are of special interest.

An American black bear, “Smoky,” a cub that had been rescued
from a forest fire in New Mexico, was presented by the U. S. Forest
Service. The animal was flown to Washington in a Piper Cub air-
plane, through the courtesy of Mr. Piper, and presented in connection
with the Forest Service’s campaign to emphasize the necessity for
prevention and control of forest fires.

PURCHASES

Some of the more important of the year’s purchases include a pair
each of great-eared foxes and fennecs; two echidnas which have
been continuously on exhibition for more than a year; a pair of
Steller’s sea lions; a pair of red howler monkeys; a greater bird of
paradise; a pair of Siberian red-breasted geese; and a male aardvark.

BIRTHS AND HATCHINGS

It was a surprise when both pairs of the Zoo’s hybrid bears (female
Alaska brown bear X male polar bear) produced litters of cubs.
One of the cubs (named Gene) was raised and has grown into a husky
bear and, because of its ancestry, a famous one.

The English Park cattle, the gaur, the pygmy hippopotami, and the
Chinese water deer have been breeding regularly.

A baby black-fronted duiker was born.

One pair of Acoumba lemurs produced a young one that has done
amazingly well.

A pair of snowy egrets in the flight cage at the bird house built a
nest, hatched two eggs, and raised the young to maturity.

Roseate spoonbills nested and hatched three young.

RESEARCH

Scientific research is not set up as a separate activity in the National
Zoological Park but is an important part of the operation. The
proper care of hundreds of different kinds of animals, some of which
have not previously been kept alive, calls for constant observation
and study to determine for each one its natural living conditions, likes
and dislikes. Usually the most important step is to try foods that
will be acceptable substitutes for those that the animals would nor-
mally obtain in the wild. Other conditions, such as humidity, tem-
perature, type of bedding, types of perch, indeed everything affecting
SECRETARY’S REPORT 91

the animal in captivity, require constant study to make certain that
a suitable environment is maintained. JF ailure to provide the proper
conditions is likely to result in the loss of animals that are often
of great value and are sometimes irreplaceable. Even if the animals
do not die, they are almost certain to become unsuitable for exhibition
if not properly cared for.

In the course of carrying on in his home studies of small mammals
that were not well known or that had been considered difficult or
impossible to keep alive in captivity, the Assistant Director has
developed a food mixture that has proved highly satisfactory. The
lesser short-tailed shrew (Cryptotis parva) and the large African
elephant shrew (Macroscelides rufescens) were fed this and produced
young, the short-tailed shrews even producing the second generation
in captivity. Four species of bats thrived on this diet exclusively.
The greater short-tailed shrews (Llarina brevicauda) and star-nosed
mole (Condylura cristata) preferred this to most other food. It has
been offered to many other small and medium-sized mammals such
as marmosets, night monkeys, and several different kinds of rodents
and carnivores, practically all of which like the food. It has been so
successful with specialized mammals that have heretofore been very
difficult or impossible to keep in captivity, that it appears worth
while to publish the formula:

One yolk of hard-boiled egg; approximately an equal amount of rather dry
cottage cheese; approximately an equal amount of ripe banana; approximately
an equal amount of mealworms; 6 drops of Jeculin; 6 drops of wheat-germ-oil;
6 grains of Theragram.

Make up the mixture with a mortar and pestle. If the wheat-germ oil is in
3-minim capsules put in two; add the Theragram, which is a yellowish paste;
add a few drops of water to soften the gelatin of the wheat-germ-oil capsules and
to dissolve the Theragram. Then put in the other ingredients and grind all
together with the pestle until a paste is formed with the chitin of the mealworms
scattered through it.

The mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) are the same as, or similar to,
those that get into cereals. Cultures of them can be maintained in
bran or cornmeal with the addition of banana peelings, slices of raw
potato, and occasionally light sprinklings of water to moisten the
bran or cornmeal very slightly but not enough to cause if to form
lumps or to mildew.

The Assistant Director has also developed a milk mixture that has
been tried out with many small mammals with excellent success.
It is as follows:

Three ounces cow’s milk from which about one-third of the cream has been

removed; 1 teaspoonful raw egg yolk; 4 drops Jeculin; 1 drop Navitol or
Viosterol; }4 teaspoonful calcium gluconate.
92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

Stir until thoroughly mixed. Keep in refrigerator. Warm the small amount
needed for each feeding. Use same care in sterilizing utensils as would be used in
caring for a human baby.

MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS

In addition to the numerous daily small repairs, substantial prog-
ress was made during the year in maintenance work of a more perma-
nent improvement character.

The 85,000-gallon sea-lion pool that had been leaking seriously was
completely relined with concrete. Four-hundred linear feet of con-
crete coping for fence was built and 400 feet of 6-foot fencing erected
thereon; a parking area between the restaurant and the creek, 300 feet
long and 20 feet wide, was given a bituminous-stone surfacing; the
surface of the area behind the cages above the reptile house was im-
proved by 2,100 square feet of cement surfacing, 175 linear feet of
curb, 175 feet of concrete retaining wall 4 feet high, and 60 linear feet
of steps; V-gutters were installed in front of these cages. This will
improve the appearance of the area, check erosion, and improve
sanitation. Three hundred eighty-six feet of 4-inch soil pipe and
fittings were installed to provide for sewage disposal from the vicinity
of the cook house; a high-voltage cable was laid from the basement of
the reptile house to the cook house to provide current for the electric
oven. The space in the bird house formerly occupied by eight double-
deck bird cages that had never been satisfactory was remodeled to
accommodate three large cages that are much better. Five thousand
square feet of parking area was surfaced with bituminous-stone mixture,
At odd times, particularly when outside work could not be carried on,
the making of cement legs for benches and cement tables was continued.

VISITORS

The number of visitors was 3,437,669, an increase of 91,619 over
the previous year. This was the largest attendance in the history of
the Zoc and was probably due in part to the continued high employ-
ment in the Washington area, increase in travel accompanying the
general economic prosperity, and the frequency with which the
Zoo was able to announce the addition of interesting specimens to the
collection. The variation in attendance on the different days of the
week, which was so extreme before the war, has been much less
noticeable. Formerly early days of the week had relatively low
attendance, with an increasing number of visitors the latter portion of
the week, and very large crowds on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
There is also a considerable increase in the earlier hours of the day.

About 2 p.m. each day the cars then parked in the Zoo are counted
by the Zoo police and listed according to the State, Territory, or
country from which they came. ‘This is, of course, not a census of
the cars coming to the Zoo but is valuable in showing the percentage
of attendance, by States, of people in private automobiles. The
tabulation for the fiscal year 1950 is as follows:

94 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

FINANCES

The regular appropriation provided in the District of Columbia
appropriation act was $544,700.

The stone restaurant building, which was constructed in the Park
in 1940 under an allotment of $90,000, is under a 3-year lease, obtained
by competitive bidding, at $23,052 per annum. This money is
deposited in the general fund of the United States Treasury. The
concessionaire serves meals and light refreshments and sells souvenirs.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

The principal needs of the Zoo remain as they have for several
years, i. e., the replacement of antiquated structures that have long
since ceased to be suitable for the purpose. The more urgently
needed buildings are: (1) A new administration building to replace
the 145-year-old historic landmark now in use for an office building
for the Zoo, but which is neither suitably located nor well adapted
for the purpose. This building is in an excellent location for a public
recreational structure and could probably be rehabilitated and used
for recreational purposes, perhaps as a children’s museum, and thus
maintained as a historic building. The new office building should be
better located both from the standpoint of accessibility to the public
and convenience for the administration of the Zoo. (2) A new
building to house antelopes and other medium-sized hoofed animals
that require a heated building.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Srr: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1950:

The Astrophysical Observatory has continued its two divisions, the
Division of Astrophysical Research, devoted to the study of solar
radiation, and the Division of Radiation and Organisms, founded in
1929 for the study of radiation effects on organisms.

Beginning September 1, 1948, the Division of Radiation and Organ-
isms was entirely reorganized under the new chief of the division, Dr.
Robert B. Withrow. During this fiscal year Dr. Withrow’s extensive
program of remodeling and reconditioning the laboratories was com-
pleted and his new research program inaugurated.

Progress on the new editions of the Smithsonian Meteorological
Tables and the Smithsonian Physical Tables can be reported. The
sixth edition of the Meteorological Tables was in press at the end of
the year, and the manuscript of the ninth edition of the Physical
Tables was nearly completed. This new and completely revised
edition of the Physical Tables has been compiled under the direction
of Dr. William E. Forsythe. Preparation of this manuscript has
proved a colossal task because of the great volume of new material
made available since the eighth revision was issued in 1932.

DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

Early in June 1950, the Director left Washington on an inspection
trip that included both the Montezuma, Chile, and the Table Moun-
tain, Calif., field stations. He spent 16 days in June at the
first-named station and 9 days in July at the second. Excellent skies
prevailed especially at Montezuma during his stay. Many intercom-
parisons of instruments were made, as well as direct comparisons with
substandard silver-disk pyrheliometer S. I. No. 5, which he carried
with him from Washington. Inventories were made at both stations
of all nonexpendable equipment on hand. Various phases of the work
were discussed in detail with the personnel of the field stations.

The Montezuma field station has now been in continuous operation
for 30 years. Throughout this period an average of three determina-

116
SECRETARY'S REPORT hig ere

tions of the solar constant was made on each day that skies were
sufficiently clear. And throughout this whole period every effort
was made to maintain the solar-constant values on the same scale.
It seems worth while, therefore, to examine whether in these years
of observation there is evidence of a progressive change in total radia-
tion given off by the sun. The following table gives the mean solar
constant for three decades:

constant determinations Mean value of the

G41 —A48) (inclusive) msee 22 es ens eee Bee 5, 004 1. 9478

This increase of one-fourth of 1 percent in the radiation emitted by
the sun in two decades (1925-44) is of particular significance in view
of evidence that has accumulated of climatic changes in various
localities over the earth. On the whole, these changes indicate that
average temperatures have increased somewhat during the past 100
years, with an accelerated increase during the past several decades.
A very interesting discussion of these evidences is given by Prof.
Julian Huxley (Natural history in Iceland, Discovery, vol. 11, No. 3,
March 1950; reprinted in general appendix of this Report, p. 327).

As stated in last year’s report, funds have been requested to re-
establish a third field station. Clark Mountain, in southern Cali-
fornia near the Nevada border, has been chosen as the most satisfac-
tory available location.

Work at Washington.—Statistical studies of, and final corrections
for, the observational data from our two field stations (Montezuma,
Chile, and Table Mountain, Calif.), were carried on under the super-
vision of W. H. Hoover, chief of the division. Mr. Hoover also
supervised the preparation of instruments and equipment for the
solar-constant observations, for special research problems in progress
at Table Mountain, and for requests for certain instruments received
from other institutions. Of these latter, three silver-disk pyrheliom-
eters, each calibrated against the Observatory’s standard pyrheli-
ometer, were furnished at cost during the year, as follows:

1. S. I. No. 82 to Dominion Physical Laboratory, New Zealand.

2. 8. I. A. P. O. No. 17 to Observatorio Cagigal, Caracas, Venezuela.

3. S. I. A. P. O. No. 18 to Central Meteorological Institute, Bucharest,
Rumania.

In addition, two modified Angstrom pyrheliometers and one special
water-vapor spectroscope were furnished to the Central Meteorologi-
cal Institute at Uccle, Belgium.

A summary of silver-disk pyrheliometry, in the form of a revision
of Dr. Abbot’s paper of 1922 on “The Silver Disk Pyrheliometer,”’
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

was published in’ December 1949 (Smithsonian Misc. Coll., vol. 111,
No. 14). This paper gives the constants and the present locations
of more than 90 pyrheliometers that have been constructed and
calibrated by the Smithsonian Institution and are now in use in
widely scattered parts of the world.

Five progress reports were submitted during the year, summarizing
observations and exposures of textiles made under contract with the
Office of the Quartermaster General, as mentioned in last year’s
report. This work was carried on mainly at Montezuma, Chile.

Both Dr. C. G. Abbot, research associate of the Observatory, and
Dr. H. Arctowski continued their special studies referred to in last
year’s report.

Work in the field—At the two continuously operating field stations
(Montezuma, Chile, since 1920, and Table Mountain, Calif., since
1925) observations for the determination of the solar constant were
made on all days having sufficiently clear skies. In addition to this
work, at Montezuma considerable time and effort were spent to main-
tain the necessary radiation measurements in the work being done
for the Quartermaster, mentioned above. These measurements were
hampered by a lack of sufficient electric power. It is hoped soon to
install new batteries and an improved generator. Since March 1,
1950, the Montezuma station has also exposed certain textiles and
other materials at the request of the National Bureau of Standards.

With the cooperation of General Motors Corp. and under the
sponsorship of the Office of the Quartermaster General, Department
of the Army, as mentioned in our reports for 1947 and 1948, the
Observatory established at Miami, Fla., in November 1947, a tem-
porary observing station, where exposures to the sun and sky were
made, both direct and through filters, of certain tent materials.
Measurements of radiation received were made, as had been done
previously at Camp Lee, Va. In addition, studies were made of the
water-vapor absorption and spectral-energy distribution of sunlight
at this moist, sea-level location. The equipment of the former field
station at Tyrone, N. Mex., was used in these studies. By July 1949
the work at Miami was nearly completed. Early in August 1949,
Mr. Hoover supervised the dismantling of this temporary Miami
station, and the equipment was transported in two trucks to the
Table Mountain, Calif., field station. Here, with the aid of funds
generously given by John A. Roebling, a second observing tunnel was
prepared, similar to, but somewhat larger than, the regular tunnel
in use at this station. The new tunnel is about 100 feet to the west
of the old one.

It is now possible, for the first time since the solar-constant program
was inaugurated nearly 50 years ago, to make simultaneous, duplicate,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 119

spectrobolometric observations at the two tunnels, each tunnel operat-
ing with independent equipment but observing the sun through the
same sky. As a preliminary to various special experiments that are
contemplated with the new tunnel, there was in progress at the end
of the fiscal year a series of duplicate solar-constant observations
taken exactly simultaneously. A study of these simultaneous obser-
vations will doubtless furnish interesting information concerning the
dependability of the instrumental and observational procedures.

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS

(Report prepared by R. B. WirHRow)

The principal activities of the Division of Radiation and Organisms
for the first two-thirds of the year were concerned with concluding the
reorganization and reconstruction of the laboratory facilities. The
division laboratories are now in first-class condition for plant photo-
chemical research and include four constant-condition rooms, as
follows:

A 2° C. cold room for chemical isolation and analyses of labile
compounds.

A plant-growing room with one large luminaire for the routine
production of plant material and eight small compartments for grow-
ing plants under controlled conditions of intensity and wavelength.

A monochromator room for action spectrum studies.

A general experimentation room.

A new type of fluorescent-incandescent luminaire has been devel-
oped which involves the use of a special type of lamp holder for the
fluorescent lamps, making it possible to put thirty-four 8-foot Slim-
line lamps in a unit 4 feet wide and 8 feet long. The separation
between the tubes is only % inch. Behind the lamps is a bank of
twelve 60-watt incandescent lamps. ‘These lamps raise the long-
wavelength energy level of the unit to permit a better type of growth
than is possible with fluorescent lamps alone. The fluorescent lamps
operate in series at 450 milliamperes on an 18,000-volt transformer
and reactor. This arrangement greatly simplifies wiring and makes
it possible to remove all auxiliary equipment from the growing room.
The luminaire has a glass window and an exhaust system, making it
possible to operate with a power input of 4 kilowatts without excessive
heating. With this luminaire it is possible to obtain 2,500 foot-
candles 2 feet below the unit. This is nearly double the intensity
possible with similar luminaires designed around conventional aux-
iliaries and standard lamp holders.

A self-condensing type of water-cooled incandescent lamp luminaire
has been developed which condenses the water vapor from the water-

922758—51——_9
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

filter cell and makes it possible to operate a unit involving one or more
internal reflector lamps without contamination of the distilled-water
filter by dust in the air or replacement of it for at least 2 weeks of
continuous operation. This type of unit is proving useful for the
incandescent irradiation of small cultures of algae and germinating
seedlings. With this luminaire it is possible to obtain 3,000 foot-
candles over small areas without excessive temperature rise of the
irradiated cultures.

Two large grating monochromators have been designed and are
now being constructed for action spectrum studies. One unit will be
used for recording absorption spectra and the other as an irradiation
monochromator for action spectrum studies. The source for the
irradiation monochromator is a 12-kilowatt carbon are.

A new type of 60-cycle conductance bridge with a phase-detector
amplifier has been developed which records directly changes in con-
ductance of 1/R instead of some complex function of resistance, as
with conventional bridges. With this instrument it is possible to
follow changes in the concentration of dilute inorganic nutrient solu-
tions with a precision of better than 0.3 percent, and no replotting of
data is necessary. Continuous recordings of the uptake of single salts
by seedlings may be followed, as well as the loss of salts from roots
and other tissues. This instrument is being used for studies of the
effect of light and growth substances on ion exchange in plant tissues.

During the latter third of the year experimental work was under
way in three general areas: First, the effect of native and synthetic
auxins on the water and ion exchange relations of potato-tuber tissue
and corn and bean roots. As this work is being supported by the
United States Army Chemical Corps, the results are not available
for this report. The second area of work pertains to an investigation
of the action spectrum and pigment systems involved in photomor-
phogenesis of seedlings. Seedlings are being grown under conditions
of constant light intensity and limited spectral range as obtained by
large dyed gelatin filters prepared in these laboratories in order to
separate photomorphogenesis from the other photochemical reactions
of phototropism, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis. The
third area of investigation pertains to the effect of light on the per-
meability of plant tissues and on the capacity of seedlings to absorb
nutrients from single salt solutions. These data are being obtained
by continuous recording of solution conductance.

A paper entitled “Light as a Modifying Influence on the Mineral
Nutrition of Plants” was presented by the chief of the division at the
Symposia on Plant Growth Substances and Mineral Nutrition of
Plants at the University of Wisconsin in September 1949.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 121

The work of the division was materially aided by a generous grant
last year by the Research Corporation for basic equipment and facil-

ities. This support is gratefully acknowledged and has been invaluable
to the reorganization program.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE NATIONAL AIR MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the National Air Museum for the fiscal year ended June 30,

1950:
HIGHLIGHTS

The National Air Museum suffered a great loss in the death in
January of General of the Air Force H. H. Arnold, whose interest in
the establishment of an aeronautical museum for the Nation was of
long standing. Following the close of World War II General Arnold
contributed generously both time and effort in the movement before
Congress to make the museum a reality, and after its establishment
in 1946 he continued, through correspondence and personal contacts,
to help the new agency. At its meeting on May 24, 1950, the
Advisory Board of the National Air Museum unanimously adopted
the following resolution:

Wuereas, The May 24 meeting of the Advisory Board of the National Air
Museum is the first since the lamented death on January 15, 1950, of General of
the Air Force H. H. Arnold; and

Wuereas, It was General Arnold who developed the idea of a National Air
Museum to memorialize the national development of aviation, and to preserve for
posterity aeronautical material of historic interest and significance; and who,
moreover, ordered the setting aside of examples of aircraft and aviation materials
used or developed during World War II for future preservation:

Therefore be it

Resolved, That the Advisory Board of the National Air Museum records in its
minutes its profound sorrow and its deep sense of loss in the death of General
Arnold, brilliant leader and man of vision and foresight; and be it further

Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the family of General Arnold
and to the Secretary of the Air Force.

On March 17, 1950, the report to Congress on the National Air
Museum, required by law, was submitted to the President of the
Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, respectively.
This report carries out the stipulation of section 3 of Public Law 722,
establishing the National Air Museum, that the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution shall submit “recommendations to Congress
for the acquisition of suitable lands and buildings for said national air
museum.”

SECRETARY’S REPORT ia

On June 1, 1950, the services of Maj. Gen. Grandison Gardner as
the United States Air Force representative on the Advisory Board
were terminated by reason of his transfer to a post of duty away from
Washington. General Gardner’s enthusiastic interest and advice on
Air Museum matters during his year’s tenure in this office were most
helpful to the Board and the Air Museum staff. In his stead, Gen.
Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Chief of Staff, United States Air Force, appointed
Lt. Gen. K. B. Wolfe as his representative on the Board.

The Air Museum had so busy a year that backlogs developed in
several of the bureau’s work programs. Requests for information
were of large volume, and a quarter of the curator’s time was spent
on this service in addition to considerable time of two associate
curators. There were accessioned and cataloged 465 items—a four-
fold increase over last year—and there were designed, prepared, and
installed three times as many temporary special exhibits of current
or commemorative significance as the year before.

Worth-while improvements were made, too, in the bureau’s condi-
tion and operations. At the Park Ridge storage facility, for example,
a considerable portion of the space originally rented by the bureau
was vacated, and the smaller retained area was enclosed by fencing.
These changes permitted the safe reduction of the watch force from
10 to 7 guards and the employment, at no increase in over-all cost,
of additional technical and clerical help to further the essential
preservation and accessioning programs. With the help of a second
museum aide added to the Washington staff, marked improvements
were made in the aeronautical exhibits.

MUSEUM BUILDING STUDIES

As indicated in the bureau’s recent annual reports, for the past 2
years studies have been conducted by the bureau’s staff in coopera-
tion with the Public Buildings Administration to determine a suitable
Museum building and site. After 17 months of work these studies
were completed, and a report thereon was presented to the Advisory
Board on June 29, 1949.

The report embodies the ideas of the Advisory Board members, of
architects and engineers of the Public Buildings Administration, and
of the professional staff of the bureau regarding the scope and volume
of the proposed aeronautical collection and the equipment, facilities,
and services required to maintain, exhibit, and preserve the collection
and operate the Museum. ‘The descriptive matter, perspective
drawings, preliminary floor plans, estimates of costs, and suggestions
of suitable sites contained in the report are believed to provide a
124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

basic scheme from which there can be developed a feasible and ade-
quate building for the national aeronautical collections.

With this report as a nucleus, the required report to Congress was
prepared this year and, as indicated earlier, was submitted to Con-
gress on March 17, 1950.

ADVISORY BOARD

A meeting of the Advisory Board of the National Air Museum was
held on May 24, 1950, with the following members present:

Dr. Alexander Wetmore, chairman, Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution; Rear Adm. A. M. Pride, Chief, Bureau of Aeronautics,
Department of the Navy; Maj. Gen. Grandison Gardner, Deputy
Chief of Staff, Matériel, Department of the Air Force; Grover Loen-
ing, Presidential appointee; William B. Stout, Presidential appointee.

The death of Gen. H. H. Arnold, who was known personally by all
members, was the subject of a commemorative conversation among
the members and resulted in the resolution mentioned in the fore part
of this report. The Board then heard brief reports by staff members
on the year’s operations by the bureau at the Park Ridge, IIl., storage
facility and in the conduct of the Museum activities in Washington.
These operations are described under separate headings in subse-
quent parts of this report. In connection with the storage operations,
the Board approved the stafi’s list of aeronautical items in the col-
lection that are to be rejected as unnecessary to the Museum.

With the knowledge that the required report to Congress on the
National Air Museum was in the hands of that body, the Board gave
considerable attention to the problems involved in advancing the
Air Museum’s site-procurement and building programs. It was
appreciated that positive action must await, as with all federally
supported building programs, specific authorization by Congress.

SPECIAL EVENTS

During the year the Air Museum participated both as host and
guest in a number of unusual events connected with the acquisition
of new aeronautical items for the national collection. The following
are worthy of mention:

On July 3, 1949, during the Air Force Association’s annual con-
vention in Chicago, and as one of the public events held at the O’ Hare
International Airport, there was received for the Museum the United
States Air Force B-29 superfort Enola Gay, famous as the first aircraft
to drop an atomic bomb in warfare. The presentation was made by
Maj. Gen. Emmett R. O’Donnell, Jr., Commanding General of the
15th Air Force, with Col. Paul W. Tibbets, pilot of the Hnola Gay,
SECRETARY'S REPORT 125

and Maj. Thomas W. Ferebee, bombardier, in attendance. C. W.
Mitman, Assistant to the Secretary for the National Air Museum,
accepted it for the Museum. ‘The previous day at the Air Force
Association annual convention luncheon, the Air Museum was awarded
a bronze plaque and citation in recognition of its continuing interest
in and devotion to the Nation’s aeronautical history. The award
was made by Gen. James Doolittle, United States Air Force (Ret.).

On July 7, 1949, at the Washington National Airport, there was
formally presented to the Museum the Stinson SR-10F airplane that
had been used by All American Aviation in airmail pick-up service
and later was employed by the Air Force in developing the techniques
of picking up airplanes, gliders, and persons from the ground. Nor-
man Rintoul, the donor, who had piloted this plane in the above
operations, demonstrated these methods prior to the presentation.

On September 8, 1949, at the airport, the City of Washington, Piper
Super Cruiser that had been flown around the world in 1947 by
Clifford Evans, Jr., was presented by William T. Piper. It was
flown in for the presentation by George Truman, who had accom-
panied Evans on the world flight in a similar airplane.

On October 7, 1949, at a small but impressive presentation ceremony
in the Aircraft Building in Washington, memorabilia of the interna-
tionally famous aviatrix Amelia Earhart, consisting of a portrait
sculpture, flight maps, globe, books, radio, photographs, models,
trophy, and medals, were presented to the Air Museum by the Amelia
Earhart Post of the American Legion, Department of California.
Mrs. Amy Otis Earhart, mother of the aviatrix, unveiled the exhibit.

On November 8, 1949, the Museum received from Power Jets, Ltd.,
London, England, the original Whittle W-1-X turbojet engine in a
presentation ceremony, held in the auditorium of the United States
National Museum, in which several of the Advisory Board members
participated. The presentation was made by the British Ambassador,
and addresses were made by W. E. P. Johnson, Managing Director
of Power Jets, and Sir Frank Whittle, the inventor of the engine, both
of whom journeyed from London, England, for the occasion. The
acceptance address was made by Dr. A. Wetmore, Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution.

On January 27, 1950, in the Regents’ Room of the Smithsonian,
in the presence of several Board members, Mr. and Mrs. Elmer F.
Wieboldt, of North Garden, Va., presented a bronze bust of Wilbur
Wright by the sculptor Oskar J. W. Hansen. With this accession,
the Museum now has bronze busts of both Orville and Wilbur Wright
by the same sculptor. They are appropriately exhibited in the Air-
craft Building.
126 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

Lastly, on June 28, 1950, the Air Museum participated as host to
a small company gathered in the Aircraft Building to witness the
awarding of a citation to Mrs. (‘Mother’) C. A. Tusch, Berkeley,
Calif., by the United States Air Force, in recognition of her great
interest in and fostering of airmen over the past 30 years. In the
course of her long voluntary service Mrs. Tusch had gathered in her
home a large collection of aeronautical memorabilia which she gener-
ously presented to the National Air Museum earlier in the year. A
token exhibit of the ‘Mother’ Tusch collection formed the back-
ground for the ceremony setting.

CURATORIAL ACTIVITIES

Tbe curator, Paul E. Garber, reports on the year’s work as follows:

The general condition of aeronautical exhibits continues good, but
the need for space is desperate. Until an adequate building of its
own is provided, the National Air Museum is restricted for its displays
to the Aircraft Building—a World War I hangar erected in 1919—and
a small hall and overhead suspended exhibits in the adjacent Arts
and Industries Building. These areas now house 37 man-carrying
aircraft together with numerous engines, structural parts, and cased
displays of parachutes, instruments, flight clothing, models, and other
material reflecting some of the accomplishments of designers, engi-
neers, and airmen. Were adequate space available a far more com-
plete picture of aeronautical progress could be created with the
irreplaceable material that the Museum now has in storage. This
is a source of much disappointment to the visitor, the student, and
historians.

A number of improvements were made in the bureau’s exhibits
during the year. Two bays in the Aircraft Building are now assigned
to the Wright Brothers. In one, the portrait busts of Wilbur and
Orville Wright are associated with memorials and awards; in the
other there is displayed a reproduction of their wind tunnel, while
on the walls their story is augmented by photographs, drawings, and
paintings. To satisfy further the public interest in the Kvity Hawk,
a 4-panel floor frame containing photographs of the Wright Brothers,
a picture of their first flight, and a nomenclature drawing of the
machine was installed beneath the plane. Twelve scale models of
aircraft, illustrating types developed and flown by a number of the
pioneers who followed the Wright Brothers, were attractively arranged
in realistic action positions in a scenic setting depicting a flying field
of the pioneer period. The planes are identified in the text on a
miniature “billboard” bordering the field. A splendid series of
paintings by Jerome D. Biederman, illustrating World War II air-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 17

craft in service, were utilized to augment an older display of scale
models of these planes. Among other exhibits improved were the
Thompson Trophy series and the story of the first American air foree—
the balloon corps established during the Civil War. With the help
of Col. Roderick Tower, who had once been a pilot of the Curtiss
Jenny now in the collection, the original numbering and insignia of
this airplane of World War I were restored, thereby improving the
appearance and authenticity of the plane. Numerous other exhibits
were serviced; the cleaning and repairing of all aircraft maintained;
and the continuing project to provide accurate drawings and a repre-
sentative space control scale model for each aircraft in the collection
was advanced.

Among new accessions of aircraft and engines, the Enola Gay and
Whittle W—1—X are outstanding. Of the 14 full-sized aircraft acces-
sioned, only one, the Roadable Autogiro, could be given exhibition in
Washington; all the others were placed in the storage area. Five
engines were received during the year, three being jets. In deference
to the increasing size of huge bombers, transports, and patrol planes,
a departure from the Museum standard airplane model scale of 1:16
was decided upon, and 1:48 adopted for the larger models. Two of
this new scale, a Northrop flying wing B-49 and a Fairchild cargo
plane C-82, were added to the collection. A large sectioned model,
1:8, of the Piasecki helicopter permits technical study of this type.
One guided missile, a Navy “Bat,” was acquired, and enables the
Museum to show the contrast between a radio-guided weapon and
the human-guided “suicide” Japanese Baka bomb previously
accessioned.

In addition to the aeronautical material actually accessioned this
year, it can be reported that the Department of the Navy has placed
in safe storage for the Museum the Lockheed P2V Truculent Turile,
which established the present long-distance, nonstop, nonrefueled
flight record, and the Vought F-5-U. The F—5-U is a unique develop-
ment of low aspect-ratio wing configuration which has an unusually
wide range of flight performance.

Projects under way at the close of the year included a rearrangement
of the aircraft engine collection in the Aircraft Building; improving,
through the use of an automatic slide projector, the illustrated story
of Colonel Lindbergh’s flights in the Spirit of St. Lowis; and prepar-
ing a commemorative display to record the fortieth anniversary of
the beginning of carrier operations in the Navy.

STORAGE

Compression of material to conserve space, development of preserva-
tion techniques, disassembly of aircraft, and packing of aeronautical
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

materials have been the four principal categories of work at the
Museum’s storage facility at Park Ridge, IIl., this year.

Following an intensive period of preplanning, the curator, with the
help of the storage facility staff and two of the staff from Washington,
concentrated the entire stored collection within about one-half of the
space previously occupied. This was followed by the erection of an
8-foot-high wire-mesh fence enclosing the entire area, the fence being
so made that individual panels are removable to facilitate the move-
ment of aircraft into and out of the area.

Preservation of aircraft flown in requires running up of the
engines and giving them protective coatings while they are free and
warm, draining tanks and venting fumes, cleaning the aircraft inside
and out, placing dehydrators, and sealing all openings with tape.
Proper treatment of material, when received, requires cleaning, in-
specting, and replacing of preservatives. A large backlog exists in
the inspection and preservation of the aeronautical items originally
transferred to the bureau by the Air Force. As an example of the
work involved in preservation, the cleaning of the propellers on the
Enola Gay, which, prior to its transfer to the Air Museum, had been
stored outdoors for a long period, required 247 man-hours of time.
Another rust-removing project involving the cleaning and applying
of preservatives to the Enola Gay’s engines will consume an estimated
1,400 man-hours.

The disassembly of aircraft condenses the space they occupy, and
this task constitutes the initial step taken toward boxing them.
Some of the planes received from the Air Force had been partially
dismantled and required further disassembly. Including these and
the aircraft dismantled entirely by the facility personnel, 59 were
handled during the fiscal year involving 1,697 man-hours.

The boxing program is intended, as far as is practical, to prepare all
stored material for safe storage and future shipment to Washington.
Twenty-nine aircraft, 67 engines, and other aeronautical materials
were already packed in boxes when received from the Air Force. The
boxes had become damaged, however, through repeated handling,
and many of them were repaired during the year. In addition, 6
airplanes were packed, requiring 18 boxes and consuming 950 man-
hours. Economies were effected by extensive salvaging of lumber
from the boxes and crates in which rejected aircraft had been placed.
Most of the aircraft and material received during the fiscal year were
delivered in permanent boxes.

These several major continuing projects begun during the year
required nearly a fifth of the curator’s time in planning and super-
vision. Several conferences of Air Force, Navy, and Air Museum
SECRETARY’S REPORT 129

personnel had to be held—for example, to develop standards for
retention or rejection of material for Museum purposes. There was
involved, too, the details of the design and procurement of a large
variety of essential equipment and supplies to carry on the work.

INFORMATIONAL SERVICES

To satisfy the demand for the bureau’s informational services,
there was required during the year the expenditure of the equivalent
of over 2 man-years of the staff’s time. Some examples of this great
volume of requests received are:

The National Defense Establishment was assisted by the loan of
models of the Navy PBY and Air Force B-25 airplanes which served
as the basis for larger models to be used for electronic evaluation tests.
The Court of Claims was aided in its investigation of the origin of
radio-shielding on aircraft engines. A number of photographs pre-
served by the Archives were given correct identification. The com-
memorative stamp issued on the forty-sixth anniversary of the Wright
Brothers’ first flight and the first anniversary of the return to America
of the Kitty Hawk, was checked for design, accuracy of technical
detail, and text by the staff, working with officials of the Post Office
Department and the Bureau of Engraving.

The aeronautics classes of the District of Columbia high schools
were supplied with a list of nonmilitary uses of aircraft compiled for
their information and discussion. The Aircraft Industries Associa-
tion was given facts regarding the Wrights’ first engine for use in a
research project. The curator served on the committee of the
National Aeronautic Association which determined the annual awardee
for the Brewer Trophy. Many hobbyist modelmakers were assisted
with loans of drawings and photographs, and photographic collectors
exchanged prints with the Museum to mutual advantage. The
Handbook of the National Aircraft Collection, written by the curator,
continues to be in great demand, and the ninth edition will shortly
be undertaken. The United Service Organization ordered this year
a large number of copies for its libraries, and many schools continue
to use it as a text.

The bureau continued, asin former years, to satisfy as far as possible
the requests of District of Columbia citizens’ groups for illustrated
lectures on aviation subjects.

SURVEY

Concentration by the staff on operations at the Washington base,
and at the field storage facility limited the time available for survey
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

trips to locate and examine new material. The following surveys
were made:

Dearborn, Mich., January 18, by the curator and Stephen Beers, associate
curator, to inspect aeronautical material at the Edison Institute.

Dayton, Obio, March 25, by Robert Strobell, associate curator, to inspect Air
Force and other material available to the museum.

APPENDIX 10
REPORT ON THE CANAL ZONE BIOLOGICAL AREA

Srr: It gives me pleasure to present herewith the annual report of
the Canal Zone Biological Area for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1950.

IMPROVEMENTS MADE

A reinforced-concrete 11,720-gallon water tank, for ordinary uses
as well as for fire protection, was built about 400 feet from the start
of the Snyder-Molino Trail. The elevation of the tank above the
laboratory level is such as to furnish enough pressure to bring the
water over the roof of the large main building. The 4,000-gallon
concrete water tank built in 1948 is now being used only for rain water
for drinking and laboratory needs.

The land south of the Chapman house was leveled in preparation
for the reconstruction of the buiiding used for corrosion and deteriora-
tion tests; and the material necessary for a 12-foot extension to this
building was purchased. The present house, originally built in 1926,
is infested with termites. Considerable progress was made in clearing
the land back of the present laboratory group to allow space for more
effective separation of our buildings to eliminate fire hazard.

The floating equipment is in good shape. A reduction gear was
added to the launch Luna. The narrow-gage rail line from the Frijoles
dock to the railroad station was relocated and improved.

SCIENTISTS AND THEIR STUDIES

During the year, 21 scientists made use of the island’s facilities.
Present costs of transportation are keeping many from coming, and
for the same reason a number of those who come do not stay as
long as they would like to. Since the laboratory was started in 1923,
about 660 separate papers relating to work done at Barro Colorado
Island have appeared in print, not including the many reports made
by representatives of Government agencies.

Dr. Alfred O. Gross, professor of biology, Bowdoin College, accom-
panied by Mrs. Gross, returned to the island after an absence of 25
years, to continue his studies of birds. He spent about 6 weeks study-
ing in great detail and photographing the Hicks’s seedeater and the
little flycatcher, Myiobius barbatus, and made valuable observations
of many other species. The island is exceptionally well suited for
the investigation of the birds of the lower tropical forest.

Dr. Robert Zanes Brown, of Johns Hopkins University, spent 6
weeks on the island, accompanied by Mrs. Brown as assistant. His
main objectives were to obtain additional ecological data on army
ants for Dr. T. C. Schneirla, of the American Museum of Natural
History, and to locate and check up on the 18 queens of Eciton hama-
tum and 9 of EF. burchelli that he marked and left with their colonies in
the 1948 dry season. He not only found the marked queens but was
able to follow their movements day by day. Dr. Brown is also inter-
ested in mammalian ecology, and, having the opportunity to see more
of the island and its life than he was able to during his 1948 visit, he
made valuable observations on population numbers and behavior.

Dr. A. M. Chickering, of Albion College, Albion, Mich., returned
to continue his exhaustive studies on the spiders of the island, Canal
Zone, and Panama. This is his fifth visit. He has published 15
papers on spiders of the region, the one on the salticids alone number-
ing 474 pages. His estimate of the number of species of spiders on
Barro Colorado Island is 1,200.

Dr. Per Host, of Norway, returned to the island to continue his
studies of the birds and mammals, as well as the general forest. With
his special photographic equipment he made additional motion pic-
tures and stills, in black-and-white and color. He also made many
wire sound recordings of the voices of the jungle. In addition to his
island studies, he revisited the Chocé Indians of Darién and the Cunas
of San Blas and made photographic records and sound recordings of
the songs, chants, and language. These records, being the only ones
in existence, will become increasingly valuable as the customs and
language of these Indians are lost through the encroachments of
civilization.

Dr. Eugene Eisenmann, of New York City, continued his study of
the birds of the region, with which he is unusually familiar. From
the island records he has prepared a list of all the birds known from
the island and has added many species to it himself.

Scott Seegers, of McLean, Va., and Mrs. Seegers, spent a few
wecks on the island to obtain first-hand information on the plants
and animals, and to consult published papers on studies made there,
in connection with the preparation of an article.

Dr. Lawrence Kilham, Microbiological Institute, Laboratory of
Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, spent 4 days on
the island, primarily to study the birds, and subsequently the mam-
mals. His 12-page report is replete with careful observations and
comparisons with conditions and the biota of Northeast Greenland.
The number of birds he saw on the island was far beyond his expecta-
tion. Of the mammals he records howler monkeys (infested with
SECRETARY’S REPORT 135

bot flies), white-faced capuchins, coati-mundis, peccaries, tamanduas,
tayras at close range, tapirs, fiequis, and sloths.

G. W. Cottrell, of the Harvard University Library, and Mrs.
Cottrell, spent about 2 weeks on the island to observe the whole
complex of plant and animal life in a tropical rain forest. Their
main interest was the study of the bird life, and, to a lesser degree,
Lepidoptera. They covered fully half of the island’s trails and had
opportunity to study and observe the abundant mammalian life.
Of birds, they identified 115 forms, 2 of which were new to the records
of the island. Also they made a representative collection of Lepidop-
tera and took many photographs.

Mrs. E. R. Kalmbach, of Denver, Colo., was able to spend 3 days
on the island, after a longer stay in Colombia. Her special interests
were the flora and the birds, and to a lesser extent the mammals.

Ken Stott, Jr., general curator of the Zoological Society of San
Diego, Calif., accompanied by Mrs. Stott, spent about 10 days on
the island gathering first-hand knowledge of birds and mammals in
the wild state in order to modify and improve the present exhibit
and maintenance of the animals in the San Diego Zoo. He found
opportunities for observing American tropical rain-forest wildlife
on Barro Colorado Island to be unparalleled from the viewpoint of a
zoo naturalist. During his brief stay he observed 102 species of birds
and 11 of mammals, among the latter the ocelot and tapir. Special
attention was given to feeding habits, particularly the manner of
feeding and the types of food preferred, especially by the three species
of diurnal primates, the tamandua anteater, the three-toed and
two-toed sloths, and a number of birds, most of which are difficult
to maintain in captivity for any great length of time.

Dr. Rolf Blomberg, of Norway, spent 2 weeks on the island collect-
ing material for his forthcoming book on the fauna of tropical America.
In his report he refers to the richness of the island fauna, to the great
helpfulness of the library facilities, and states that in no other part
of the world has he been able to carry out such studies with greater
ease and under pleasanter circumstances.

Dr. Frederick W. Loetscher, Jr., of Centre College, Danville, Ky.,
with Mrs. Loetscher, spent 2 weeks on the island, mainly to study
birds. A keen observer, he left with the laboratory a detailed list
of the 102 species he definitely identified, with notes on their abun-
dance. In addition, he made observations on the primates and
edentates. Such reports, accumulated over long periods, give a
valuable index to trends in populations, particularly relative abundance.

Dr. H. B. Goodrich, professor of biology of Wesleyan University,
Middletown, Conn., spent 4 days on the island observing and

922758—51——10
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

“experiencing” a tropical rain forest for the purpose of providing a
biological background for his teaching. He also took many color
photographs.

Dr. Cleveland Soper, director of the Tropical Research Laboratory
of Eastman Kodak Co., continued exposure tests throughout the
year, assisted by Paul Hermle, physicist, George Ade, chemist, and
Ismael Olivares, microbiologist. These tests have yielded very
valuable results, and, in Dr. Soper’s opinion, the test tables for the
island are the most practical way to determine the effectiveness of
biocides in preventing deterioration of processed photographic ma-
terials, as well as the resistance of various protective coatings to
tropical climatic conditions, etc. The correlations obtained between
samples at the test table and similar items in actual use are more
than satisfactory. Several important publications have resulted from
these studies, such as ‘‘Notes on Tropical Photography,” ‘Care of
Films and Cameras in Tropical Climates,” “Prevention and Removal
of Fungus Growth on Processed Photographic Film,” and ‘‘Notes for
the Photo-Traveler.”” The prevention of corrosion of lenses by fungi
is one of the important projects. These exposure tests emphasize
the value of rapid and long-term studies of the effects of temperature
and humidity, especially as they pertain to fungus growth. The
island is particularly well suited for studies of corrosion and deteriora-
tion and the evaluation of biocides under such severe climatic
conditions.

W. E. Lundy, of the Panama Canal and secretary-treasurer of the
Panama Canal Natural History Society, again spent about a week on
the island studying the birds and mammals, and particularly the
‘voices’ of the jungle. His observations are of special interest
because they help to give a better idea of faunal abundance and
fluctuation in numbers.

Jay A. Weber, of Miami, Fla., spent considerable time in Panamé,
part of it on the island, collecting mollusks, of which there is a super-
abundance of species. He was interested mainly in gathering the
fresh-water and land forms of the island, largely for the United States
National Museum. His previous visit to the island, to study birds,
was 22 years ago.

Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
revisited the island and held conferences with the resident manager
on plans for the future of the area and proposed improvements. W.
M. Perrygo, of the National Museum, accompanied him.

John E. Graf, Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, spent
a few days on the island examining the laboratory facilities and the
improvements made since his official visit the year before and dis-
cussing operations, plans for further improvements, and expansion.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 137

George O. Lee, professor of biology, Junior College, Canal Zone,
again brought his students for an overnight stay on the island, as
part of their school work. Similar groups from the Normal School
of Santiago, Panama, the Abel Bravo Institute in Colén, and the
National Institute of Panama likewise came to the island.

The resident manager continued his special research problems,
particularly the long-term termite-resistance tests, and host relation-
ships of the fruit-fly population. The termite-resistance tests,
started in 1924, are of increasing importance each year. During
these 25 years 42 detailed reports have been prepared and 48 papers
published, largely by Snyder, Hunt, and Zetek. It is possible now to
build in the Tropics with untreated timbers despite the abundance of
termites, and, with a minimum of vigilance, avoid the ravages of these
pests.

Tests were also made on a number of electric-wire insulations, some
untreated, others treated with pesticides and fungicides. The many
instances in which termites have eaten through lead sheathing, as
well as glass wool, prove the importance of these tests.

The Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine continued to
explore the worth and usefulness of soil poisons as deterrents to both
termites and rot.

The large Berlese funnel was kept in operation and yielded an
abundance of rare insects and mites difficult to collect otherwise.

URGENT NEEDS

A steady flow of electric current 24 hours a day is indispensable to
alaboratory. The island’s present supply of current is manufactured
by gasoline-driven generators, some of which are not dependable.
Some are single-phase, others three-phase, and this has made it
necessary to revamp the entire distribution system. A double-throw
three-pole switch had to be installed to separate the various phases
and make mistakes impossible when the various generators are used.
The drop in voltage at times is considerable. Also the gasoline and
oil consumption of the present generators makes electricity too
expensive. The only practical solution is to tap the transmission line
of the Panama Canal at Frijoles, put in transformers there and on the
island, and lay a cable along the lake bottom. This would give a
dependable 24-hour daily service at a moderate cost.

LIST OF THE VERTEBRATES OF THE ISLAND (BIRDS EXCLUDED)

The following list, brought up to date by members of the scientific
staff of the National Museum, shows a total of 173 species and sub-
species of vertebrates (exclusive of the birds) now inhabitating Barro
Colorado Island. The card index kept on the island gives pertinent

a total during the year of 241 days (999 hours). Rainfall was
above the 25-year station average. November was the rainiest month
(30 days, 211 hours). The dry season was the driest on record through-
out the Isthmus. It began on December 19, 1948, and continued
until nearly the end of April. The rainy season continued till the
SECRETARY'S REPORT 143

early part of December. The first 4 months of 1949 had a deficiency
of 5.22 inches. The rainy season showed an excess of 13.32 inches,
giving an excess of 8.10 inches for the year.

FISCAL REPORT

During the fiscal year 1950, $10,609.04 in trust funds was available.
Of this amount $10,502.83 was spent, leaving a balance of $106.21.
In addition to this, $1,184.88 is still on deposit, representing local
collections.

The following items are paid out of trust funds: Food, ice, fuel,
salaries and wages, office expenses, telephone, laboratory supplies,
freight and express, laundry, and new parts, repairs to floating equip-
ment and to generators, general upkeep, and repairs.

During the year only $742 was collected as fees from scientists.
This decline is largely due to the high cost of transportation to the
Isthmus, which keeps many from coming. Despite the higher costs
of food, wages, and other items, the laboratory has not increased
its per diem charge to scientists, and continues to give a 25-percent
discount to those who come from institutions that sustain table
subscriptions.

The following institutions continued their support to the laboratory
through the payment of table subscriptions:

The Smithsonian Institution contributed $4,500 from its private
finds, in addition to its table fees. This is included in the $10,609.04
in trust funds.

The sum of $5,000 was made available by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion from appropriated funds, and of the amount $4,988.97 was used
for permanent improvements.

APPENDIX 11
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Smithsonian Library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1950:

The primary obligation of the library in “the increase and diffusion
of knowledge” is to make constantly available to the scientific and
curatorial staff of the Smithsonian Institution the published records
of work done or in progress throughout the world in the subject fields
of the Institution’s special activities and responsibilities. All the
detailed procedures necessary to meeting this obligation are directed
toward this end. None of them are ends in themselves, and records
of them are at best only quantitative indications of growth and accom-
plishment. Mere numbers of publications acquired and handled mean
little unless those publications have been selected with discrimination
and, in terms of contemporary library parlance, “processed”’ for effec-
tive use, with the special requirements of the Smithsonian Jnstitution
always in mind. ‘The final test of the quality of the library’s work is
the thoroughness with which an investigator has been able to canvass
all the literature necessary to the successful completion or continuation
of work on his particular piece of scientific research or curatorial
assignment. No new scientific project, however unique, can be
launched without dependence upon scientific literature.

The daily record of publications delivered to the library shows a
total of 53,035 for the year, 5,102 of which were shipped from abroad
through the International Exchange Service. As usual, these books,
pampblets, and serial publications came from all over the world and
were written in many different languages. They covered all the
subjects with which the work of the Institution is directly concerned,
and many related ones as well.

The outstanding gift of the year was the fine library of some 4,000
books and pamphlets on Foraminifera collected by the late Dr. Joseph
A. Cushman, which, with its own catalog, accompanied and is to be
kept with the Cushman foraminiferal collection bequeathed by Dr.
Cushman to the Smithsonian Institution. This library is probably
unexcelled for current completeness, and additions are to be made to
it in future.

146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

Neil M. Judd’s gift of his personal collection of some 500 books
and papers on archeological subjects made it possible for the division
of archeology to continue to have the use of this literature after
Mr. Judd’s retirement.

Acknowledgments for 7,392 gifts received were sent to many differ-
ent donors to whom the library owes a lasting debt of gratitude for
their generous contributions.

The first published appearance of information about new discover-
ies, inventions, and the progress of science, technology, and the arts
in general is usually to be found in serial publications, which conse-
quently are of the utmost importance in a scientific library. <A great
many of those the Institution regularly receives are sent by organiza-
tions and institutions with which it is in continuing exchange. Ex-
cept for the issues represented by 287 paid subscriptions, most of the
16,961 parts of periodicals currently entered were exchange publica-
tions. In the course of the year 344 new exchanges were arranged,
and 7,016 volumes and parts needed to complete sets, or for other
purposes, were obtained in response to 604 special requests.

A good catalog is the key to the contents of the library, and good
cataloging is a basic requirement of efficient library service. Upon its
quality and completeness depends the ease or difficulty with which
the resources of the library can be discovered. The classification
and subject analysis of complex scientific publications, many of them
written in foreign languages, is scholarly work. 'The cards filed in
catalogs and shelflists are the clerical records of that work. During
the past year 6,822 publications were fully cataloged, and 30,006
catalog and shelflist cards were filed. The work of correlating the
central periodical records with those of the central catalog was con-
continued, and 1,000 entries were checked and accurately unified.
Neither the central catalog nor the individual catalogs of the different
bureau libraries can be the fully effective instruments that they
ought to be until the very large number of unclassified and incom-
pletely cataloged publications throughout the Institution can be
properly cataloged. This is so large an undertaking that a special
corps of catalogers would be needed to complete it within a predict-
able period of time.

In all, 18,719 publications were sent to the Library of Congress.
Of this number 6,053 volumes and parts were marked and recorded as
permanent additions to the Smithsonian Deposit. Other publica-
tions included 1,303 doctoral dissertations, received chiefly from conti-
nental European universities. The remainder were foreign and
domestic documents and miscellaneous books, pamphlets, and period-
icals on subjects not of immediate interest to the Institution.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 147

A considerable number of publications on special subjects were
sent to other scientific libraries of the Government. Included among
them were 776 medical dissertations and 2,058 other publications on
medical subjects sent to the Army Medical Library, and 416 agri-
cultural publications sent to the Department of Agriculture.

Records of binding show that funds were sufficient to permit 1,511
volumes, chiefly periodicals, to be sent to the Government Printing
Office. Repairs to 1,023 volumes were made in the Museum library.
The deterioration of completed volumes of periodicals that must
wait for sufficient funds before they can be bound is one of the serious
problems of the library, as is the care and repair of the many old
books, some of them irreplaceable, that the Institution is so fortunate
as toown. The library is in no sense a museum of fine books. It is
an active working collection, but the very character of the Institu-
tion’s responsibilities, especially in connection with the work of the
National Museum, makes it inevitable that many old as well as new
books should be in constant use as tools. That some of them happen
to be also collectors’ items is incidental but makes their care and pro-
tection doubly important.

It was not possible to undertake further work on the organization
of the large collection of duplicates and unstudied material housed
in the west stacks, but more than 36,000 pieces, mostly parts of
periodicals previously checked and arranged, were sent to the United
States Book Exchange to be used as opportunity offers in exchange for
material drawn from the stockpile of that center.

No reliable figure showing over-all use of the library can be given.
The large decentralization of its collections, especially in the Museum,
where 30 of its sectional libraries are in the custodial charge of the
curators, makes it impractical to attempt to keep statistical records
of the intramural use of books and periodicals. Loan-desk records
show that 12,522 publications were borrowed for use outside the
library, 2,181 of which were interlibrary loans made to 104 different
Government, university, and other institutional libraries throughout
the country.

Loans are not made to individuals other than staff members and
affiliates of the Institution, but the resources of the library are open
to any individual who wishes to make reference use of them, either by
coming in person or by telephoning or writing to the library. The
library receives hundreds of requests for information in the course
of the year, and whether the inquirer is a scholarly research worker or
a casual sightseer, a foreign correspondent or a rural schoolboy, the
staff makes every effort to see that his question is answered, either by
finding and giving him the requested information or by referring him
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

to an appropriate authority elsewhere. This is by no means an unim-
portant part of the “diffusion of knowledge,” and especially in terms
of good will, is a richly rewarding one.

It is regrettable that no relief for the overcrowding of the library

can be reported.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF
THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITHSO-
NIAN INSTITUTION

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1950

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Your executive committee respectfully submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Smithsonian Institution, together with a
statement of the appropriations by Congress for the Government
bureaus in the administrative charge of the Institution.

SMITHSONIAN ENDOWMENT FUND

The original bequest of James Smithson was £104,960 8s. 6d.—
$508,318.46. Refunds of money expended in prosecution of the
claim, freights, insurance, and other incidental expenses, together with
payment into the fund of the sum, £5,015, which had been withheld
during the lifetime of Madame de la Batut, brought the fund to the
amount of $550,000.

Since the original bequest, the Institution has received gifts from
various sources, the income from which may be used for the general
work of the Institution. These, including the original bequest, plus
savings, are listed below, together with the income for the present year.

ENDOWMENT FUNDS

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects of
art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whistler,
Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for the
construction of a building to house the collection, and finally in his
will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities to
the estimated value of $1,958,591.42, as an endowment fund for the
operation of the Gallery.
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

The above fund of Mr. Freer was almost entirely represented by
20,465 shares of stock in Parke, Davis & Co. As this stock advanced
in value, much of it was sold and the proceeds reinvested so that the
fund now amounts to $6,420,811.53 in selected securities.

The practice of maintaining savings accounts in several of the
Washington banks and trust companies has been continued during
the past year, and interest on these deposits amounted to $696.21.

In many instances, deposits are made in banks for convenience in
collection of checks, and later such funds are withdrawn and deposited
in the United States Treasury. Disbursement of funds is made by
check signed by the Secretary of the Institution and drawn on the
United States Treasury.

The foregoing report relates only to the private funds of the Insti-
tution.

The Institution gratefully acknowledges gifts from the following:
E. J. Brown, for purchase of bird specimens.

Laura Welsh Casey, addition to capital of Thomas Lincoln Casey Fund.
Florence Brevoort Eickemeyer Estate, for preservation and care of Rudolph Hicke-

meyer photographic collection.

E. R. Fenimore Johnson, for researches in underwater photography.

Mary E. Maxwell Estate, income for use in preservation of Maxwell Collection.
National Academy of Sciences, for services in connection with a special mission.
National Geographic Society, for balance of expenses of expedition to Arnhem Land.
Alberto A. Eno, for establishment of Southwest Archeological Fund.

The following appropriations were made by Congress for the
Government bureaus under the administrative charge of the Smith-
sonian Institution for the fiscal year 1950:

palanies andi expensege a ase a ee ee eee $2, 346, 000. 00

In addition, funds were transferred from other Departments of the
Government for expenditure under direction of the Smithsonian
Institution as follows:

International Information and Educational Activities (transferred

to the Smithsonian Institution from the State Department) __ $82, 510. 00
Working Fund, transferred from the National Park Service,

The Institution also administers a trust fund for partial support
of the Canal Zone Biological Area, located on Barro Colorado Island
in the Canal Zone.

The report of the audit of the Smithsonian private funds follows:

WasHINGTON, D. C., September 18, 1950.
To THe Boarps orf REGENTS,
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington 25, D. C.

We have examined the accounts of the Smithsonian Institution relative to
its private endowment funds and gifts (but excluding the National Gallery of
Art and other departments, bureaus, or operations administered by the Institution
under Federal appropriations) for the year ended June 30, 1950. Our examina-
tion was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and
accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

The Institution maintains its accounts on a cash basis and does not accrue
income and expenses. Land, buildings, furniture, equipment, works of art,
living and other specimens and certain sundry property are not included in the
accounts of the Institution.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly the
position of the private funds and the cash and investments thereof of the Smith-
sonian Institution at June 30, 1950 (excluding the National Gallery of Art and
other departments, bureaus, or operations administered by the Institution under
Federal appropriations) and the cash receipts and disbursements for the year
then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1950

163
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the GeNrRAL Aprrnpix to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
staff members and collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a
general character or on special topics that are of interest or value to
the numerous correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report of 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1950.

BEYOND THE MILKY WAY?

By THorRNTON PAGE
Yerkes Observatory

{With 4 plates]

Before we can appreciate this topic it is necessary to understand pre-
cisely what is meant by the term “Milky Way” and how we can know
when we are “beyond” it. Initially it is simple to define the Milky
Way as the faint band of light which can be seen on clear nights to
extend completely around the whole sphere of the sky and which tele-
scopes have resolved into myriads of faint stars. As we shall see, the
term has come to mean more than just what we can see; to some extent
it is synonymous with the term “galaxy,” which describes our concept
of an organized system of stars, diffuse clouds of gas, and other ma-
terial, inside of which we are located, and the study of which has oc-
cupied astronomers for several decades and will probably occupy them
for several decades to come.

Why should these faint stars be distributed so peculiarly, as if in a
doughnutlike ring around us? A simple interpretation comes to
mind if we assume, for the moment, that all stars are intrinsically of
about the same brightness. Then these faint stars of the Milky Way
would be farther away than the brighter stars, their apparent bright-
ness being less the more distant they are. (The apparent brightness of
a luminous source is known from other considerations to be inversely
proportional to the square of the distance.) Although refinements
are necessary, this simple deduction from an unproved assumption is
one of the basic methods for measuring astronomical distances. We
must investigate further these distances and their measurement before
the term “beyond” can have any meaning.

Astronomical distances are well recognized to be considerably larger
than the distances we are familiar with; it is quite impossible to com-
prehend them in an absolute sense. But since we are concerned here
only with one thing being “beyond” another, an appreciation of the
relative sizes of various distances is sufficient. To avoid large num-
bers, it is convenient to use large units of distance: the “astronomical
unit,” which is about 100 million miles (accurately the distance to the

sun), and the “light-year” (some 63,000 astronomical units—or the
distance light travels in 1 year).

The most basic method of measuring distances between astronomical
bodies (where it is impossible to pace out, or scale off, a distance, as
we can do on the earth) is triangulation, a method used by surveyors,
and familiar to most of you. It depends only on the validity of the
axioms of Euclidean geometry, from which the lengths of the sides of
a triangle can be deduced if one side and two angles are given (or
measured), and the applicability of those axioms to rays of light. Ob-
servations from the two ends of a “base line” on the earth itself can
thus be used to measure the distances to the nearby members of the
solar system—to the moon, sun, planets, and comets—to anything, in
fact, within about 50 astronomical units, beyond which the angles in-
volved are too small to measure. Now since the earth goes around the
sun in an orbit of known dimensions, this “parallax method” can be
vastly extended, by using the diameter of the earth’s orbit as base line,
to determine distances to stars as far as 500 light-years away. Still,
the parallax method is too limited; almost all the faint stars of the
Milky Way seem to be considerably farther away than 500 light-years.

Returning to the “brightness method” of measuring distance, we
are disappointed to discover (after a few hundred star distances are
measured by the parallax method) that our assumption of the stars
being all of the same intrinsic luminosity was a poor one; some stars
are only one ten-thousandth the candlepower of the sun, others 10,000
times as bright, when the effect of distance is taken into account.
However, we might expect to find some subclasses of stars whose mem-
bers are all of about the same brightness; in other words, we might
hope to discover some earmark by which we can recognize the stars of
very large candlepower—a thousand times that of the sun, say—and,
after checking such a “luminosity criterion” among the closer stars
whose distances are measured by the parallax method, use it to de-
termine the distances of other stars much farther away by the bright-
ness method. This is precisely the nature of one of the important re-
search projects being undertaken at the Warner and Swasey Observa-
tory by Dr. Nassau, the director, and Dr. Morgan of the Yerkes Ob-
servatory. They are using the B stars—stars of bluish hue that can
also be recognized from their spectra—to determine distances to the far
reaches of the Milky Way system. Previously, much the same method
was applied by Dr. Shapley, first at Mount Wilson, then at the Har-
vard Observatory, to the now famous “Cepheid variables” whose
period of fluctuation was found to be the earmark of their intrinsic
luminosity. Shapley also found that certain types of clusters of stars
have a total combined candlepower in each case some 30,000 times that
ofthesun. These “globular clusters,” easily recognized by their form,

Messier 31 in the constellation Andromeda, an extragalactic nebula far beyond
the confines of the Milky Way system. Because other similar nebulae are
seen at all angles of tilt (from circular form, as on plate 4, to lenticular forms
seen edge-on), Messier 31 is interpreted as a circular disk, tilted with one edge
toward us. The two smaller bright fuzzy patches are other extragalactic
nebulae (of elliptical type) at about the same distance as Messier 31. (Photo-

are so powerful that they can be used to measure distances up to a
million light-years. Using the distances and directions of the globu-
lar clusters, Shapley plotted the positions of about 100 of them and
found that they are distributed in a large spherical volume of space,
the center of this array being at a point in the brightest part of the
Milky Way, in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. It was
reasonable to assume, as Shapley did, that this point is the center of
the Milky Way system.

At this juncture it is necessary to examine one of those refinements
of method with which astronomers continually busy themselves. In
using the brightness method of measuring distance, Shapley assumed
that interstellar space is transparent; that the only reason one globular
cluster appears fainter than another is because of its greater distance.
For reasons too lengthy to indicate here, astronomers now know that
dust and gas between the stars also dim the light of distant stars, and
this smokiness of interstellar space, neglected by Shapley, made his dis-
tances somewhat too large. Correcting for interstellar absorption,
we find the distance to the center of the Milky Way system to be
about 30,000 light-years, a figure corroborated, incidentally, by studies
of the dynamics of the galaxy—how it is held together without col-
lapsing, and how it moves.

Our present picture of the Milky Way, then, is that of a flat pancake
of stars, gas, and dust, some hundred million light-years across, in
which the sun and planets are located about two-thirds of the way
from the center to the edge, and which is partly embedded in a spher-
ical array of globular clusters extending out some 30,000 light-years
from the center. Now we can discuss what is beyond it.

Because they are extended surfaces, in contrast to the stars which
appear as mere points of light in a telescope, the nebulae are some of
the most interesting objects in the sky. From their form, their spectra,
their positions, and, when established, their distances, two classes of
nebulae can be distinguished: the galactic nebulae and the extragalac-
tic nebulae. The former are, by and large, irregular in shape; they
show the spectra (colors of light) emitted by low-density gases, and,
as their name implies, they are found mostly near the Milky Way in
the sky, at distances which place them well within that system. The
extragalactic nebulae, on the other hand, have circular, elliptical, and
spiral shapes, their spectra are like a mixture of star spectra, they are
found predominantly in parts of the sky other than the Milky Way,
and their distances have been found to be enormously larger than any-
thing in the galaxy. This last point is the crux of the matter; how
can we prove that these spiral and elliptical nebulae are beyond the
confines of the Milky Way system ?

The answer is simple if you have a large enough telescope. With the
large telescopes in existence today, it is possible to photograph the
separate stars and clusters in the largest (and closest) of the spirals,
the great Andromeda nebula. Using the brightness method, and tak-
ing account of the nearby smokiness of our own Milky Way system, but
assuming that space outside is transparent, Hubble has shown that the
Cepheid variables and clusters in the Andromeda nebula must be about
a million light-years away. Once the distances of another half dozen
extragalactic nebulae were found by these methods, Hubble determined
their average intrinsic luminosity (about 85 million times the sun’s),
and can now determine the distances to much more distant nebulae with
the aid of this information. Using longer and longer exposures on
faster and faster photographic plates with larger and larger tele-
scopes, Hubble has pushed the confines of observable space out to over
a billion light-years. In this vast volume he estimates there are some
hundreds of millions of extragalactic nebulae, basing this estimate,
of course, on a limited number of “sample” plates. Surveys now
under way with the 20-inch refractor at the Lick Observatory and
the 48-inch Schmidt camera at Palomar will cover somewhat smaller
volumes more completely.

What can we find out about these distant objects so far beyond the
Milky Way? It seems to me that the studies which have already been
undertaken, and which are now under way, can be grouped in this man-
ner, although there is some overlapping: First, we can find out more
about individual extragalactic nebulae, their distances, sizes, masses,
forms, and contents; second, as with any large class of objects, we
can try to group them into further meaningful subclasses, third, we
can study their motions, so far as they can be measured, and finally,
their numbers and distribution in space. ‘This last problem, literally
the biggest in modern science, turns out to be linked with our funda-
mental notions of space and time.

Although it may seem simple, in principle, to determine the linear
size of an object from its angular size and its distance, there are serious
practical difficulties in the case of the nebulae. They have no clearly
defined edges. Photographs of longer exposure show greater exten-
sions, and there are reasons to believe that the Andromeda nebula, for
example, is well over five times as large as what we can see in a tele-
scope. The best photographs of this spiral show an angular extent
corresponding to a diameter of about 40,000 light-years, at its distance
of over 700,000 light-years. This is roughly the same size as the Milky
Way system, which seems reasonable enough. (In fact, our picture of
the Milky Way system has been developed partly by analogy to the
form of spiral nebulae; in other words, it has long been in the back of
astronomers’ minds that the galaxy and the spirals are the same class
BEYOND THE MILKY WAY—PAGE 169

of objects.) But other spirals and the elliptical nebulae are found to
have diameters much smaller than this; from 2,000 light-years to 10,000
light-years. We are thus forced to the conclusion that our galaxy is a
giant among the spiral nebulae.

How can we “weigh” a nebula consisting of billions of stars? The
method is similar to that for determining the mass of the sun; it de-
pends upon measuring the motions of other masses in the vicinity.
Since the outer stars in a nebula are attracted by the rest of the nebula,
just as the planets are attracted by the sun, they would “fall” into the
center were they not in motion in an orbit around that center. The
notion is a measure of the gravitational pull of the nebula, which in
turn is a measure of its mass. We can scarcely hope to see—or photo-
graph—such motion as a change of position in the sky; at a distance of
a million light-years a star would have to be moving at about 9,000
miles per second across the line of sight to change its position by even 1
second of arc in a century! Luckily there is a more sensitive method
of measuring motion along the line of sight (toward or away from us)
by its effect on the spectrum. This “Doppler effect,” which may be de-
duced from basic notions of the nature of light, space, and time, con-
sists of a slight change in color, toward the red for recession and
toward the blue for approach, which can easily be detected with a spec-
trograph, if the light source has readily identified original colors in its
spectrum. Early work at the Lowell Observatory and more recent
work at the Lick Observatory have established from this effect that the
spirals are rotating—at least, the ones viewed edge-on show more ap-
proach at one end than at the other. The amount of rotation of the
outermost parts indicates a mass about 100 billion times that of
the sun for the Andromeda nebula, and smaller masses, about 1 bil-
hon to 10 billion suns, for other nebulae. Similar reasoning leads us
to expect that the Milky Way system is also rotating; this has been
measured, and leads to a mass of over 200 billion suns. Again we
find our own galaxy larger than the rest, which seems to leave us
in a “preferred” position in the universe. Moreover, there are other
reasons to feel dissatisfied with these small measured values of nebular
masses, as will become apparent later on.

The form and content of the extragalactic nebulae have contributed
largely to their classification. Although there are others, the most
meaningful classification seems to be one proposed by Hubble. He
recognized three broad classes, based on form alone: the elliptical
nebulae, the spirals, and the barred spirals. Within each of these
classes there is a continuous sequence from “early” to “late” types—
from smaller, more compact forms to larger, looser forms in the
spirals, and from circular to more elliptical forms in the elliptical
nebulae. The terms “early” and “late” seem to have been unhappily
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

chosen, as it now appears that the “late” types, if anything, are
younger inage. ‘This conclusion is based by the German astrophysicist
von Weizicker on dynamical arguments, by Baade and others on the
content. Baade, at Mount Wilson, has superposed on Hubble’s classi-
fication a distinction between two types of stellar population: Type
I, associated with spiral arms, consists primarily of gas clouds and
large, hot, blue stars which are thought, from considerations of stellar
evolution to be young; type II population, associated with the ellip-
tical nebulae and the cores of spirals, consists primarily of cooler
stars, which may be quite as old as the earth and sun—a good 3
billion years. Hubble’s three classes can be arranged in a kind of
sequence, from the globular (circular appearing) elliptical nebulae,
through the more and more elliptical types, through a transition type
neither elliptical nor spiral, and then, in two parallel “branches,”
through the later and later types of spirals, both normal and barred.
If the more recent ideas are correct, spiral evolution is taking place
in the reverse direction; late-type spirals are collapsing to the final
stage of globular nebulae.

One aspect of the content of extragalactic nebulae has received but
scant attention until recently. Just as in our own galaxy, there is
interstellar gas and dust in the other nebulae. The dust shows up
as dark streaks on photographs; the gas emits light of the character-
istic colors of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases. In the
extragalactic nebulae we have an excellent opportunity to study the
distribution and physical conditions of these interstellar gases, and
work now in progress at the McDonald Observatory is directed to
this end.

We have already seen how one component of the motion (the radial
velocity) of nebulae can be measured by the Doppler effect, and how
their distances can be estimated by the brightness method. In 1925,
Hubble and Humason at the Mount Wilson Observatory noted a
correlation between these two, in the sense that velocity of recession
for nebulae on all sides of us increases with increasing distance. The
later work of Hubble and Humason has shown a remarkable relation
which holds as far as the spectra of nebulae can be observed: the
velocity of recession on every side is proportional to the distance, and
increases about 100 miles per second in each million light-years.

At first sight, this observation seems to leave us—or our galaxy—
in a central and highly repelling position, with all the rest of the uni-
verse “running away from us.” A moment’s reflection shows, however,
that the “velocity-distance law” implies a symmetrical view from any
other nebula; an observer there, considering himself “at rest,” would
see the others “running away” from him, and with velocities propor-
tional to their distances. As for explanation of this strange behavior,
BEYOND THE MILKY WAY—PAGE 171

there are several. The most easily visualized is based on the simple
assumption that a cosmic explosion started the nebulae moving apart
from a common starting point with speeds which have since remained
roughly constant, and that the fastest moving ones have naturally got
the farthest. From this simple concept, together with the rate of in-
crease of recessional velocity with distance, we can readily compute
that the explosion must have taken place some 2 billion years ago,
a figure in fair agreement with the age of the earth determined from
quite different data (radioactive decay in minerals). However, there
are further complications which cast doubt on this simple explanation.

There are so many nebulae that a plot of each one’s position in space
would be literally an endless task. The best means of representing
their distribution in space so far devised has been to count, or estimate,
the numbers out to various distances. For instance, a survey by Shap-
ley and Ames at Harvard showed over a thousand nebulae actually
brighter than “thirteenth magnitude” (visible in a 6- or 7-inch tele-
scope), another by Mayall at the Lick Observatory shows an estimated
9 million over the whole sky brighter than “nineteenth magnitude”
(corrected for obscuration by local interstellar dust) from sam-
ple plates taken with the 36-inch reflector, and two other sampling
surveys by Hubble with the 100-inch telescope at the Mount Wilson
Observatory indicate that there are an estimated 70 million brighter
than the “twentieth magnitude”—as faint as the 100-inch telescope
can conveniently photograph. From the average intrinsic bright-
nesses of nebulae we can convert these figures to (roughly) : 2,000
within 13 million light-years, 9,000,000 within 200 million light-years,
and 70,000,000 within 450 million light-years.

These numbers are about what we would expect if the nebulae were
evenly distributed, about 2 in each 10-billion-billion cubic light-years.
The numbers would then increase with the cube of the distance, since
the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius. The
two deepest surveys, however, depart slightly from the cube law, indi-
cating a thinning out of nebulae the farther we go from our galaxy.
Now it has been repugnant to astronomers since the time of Copernicus
to consider ourselves “at the center,” as this thinning out would imply;
hence a number of efforts have been made to interpret this last result,
tentative though it may be, in such a way that no “center” is necessary.
A number of difficulties arise; for instance, we are seeing the distant
nebulae not where they are now, but where they were 138 to 450
million years ago, the time required for their light to reach us. Their
intrinsic brightness, too, may not be constant in time. And it is certain
that their light is so changed toward redder color by the Doppler effect
that a correction must be made for its reduced power to blacken the
172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1950

photographic plate. What is more, a receding source should theoreti-
cally be fainter than the same source of light at rest.

Using the best data available in 1935, Hubble and Tolman concluded
that these deepest surveys can be understood if space itself is “curved,”
somewhat like a two-dimensional surface can be curved into the form
of asphere. Just as there is not as much area in a circle on the surface
of a sphere as there is within a circle of the same radius on a flat sur-
face, so, too, there would be less “room” in “curved space” than in “flat
space,” as we normally conceive it, for spirals at great distances from
us. This conclusion was inspired by Einstein’s General Theory of Rel-
ativity, which ascribes what we normally call gravitation to a kind
of curvature of space; in other words, space is expected to be curved
by the mass of matter contained in it. Unfortunately the curvature of
space necessary to explain Hubble’s counts of the nebulae is very
large—corresponding to a radius of only 500 million light-years or so,
which implies a very large amount of matter, not at all in agreement
with the observed space density of spirals and the (small) masses
measured from their rotations.

This is the impasse we have reached in our attempt to understand the
universe beyond the Milky Way. It may be removed by improving the
observational data; by better measurement of the masses of spirals,
including the faint outer parts, as we are trying to do at the McDonald
Observatory; by finding evidence for matter between the spirals; by
improving the correction for the Doppler effect as Stebbins and Whit-
ford of Wisconsin are doing in their color work at Mount Wilson;
or by better and more complete surveys of the nebulae which are soon
to be expected from the 48-inch Schmidt telescope and 200-inch tele-
scope at Palomar. Or it may be removed by some new line of theoreti-
cal reasoning such as the Kinematical Relativity of Milne, in Eng-
land, or by taking account of the clustering of nebulae, in a revision
of Tolman’s calculations, as now being undertaken by Omer at Chi-
cago. Probably the solution will be found through some combination
of these, but I have no doubt that, when it is reached, some even larger
problem will be found to take its place.
THE LUMINOUS SURFACE AND ATMOSPHERE OF
THE SUN?

There is no process in nature more important to us than the radia-
tion of light and heat from the surface of the sun. The famous
American astronomer Charles E. St. John, of the Mount Wilson
Observatory, once expressed this in a lecture? in the following words:

Not only is the motion of the earth in space controlled by the masterful sun,
but what is more directly evident, the sun is the source of practically all our
light and heat, without which life, as we know it, could not exist upon the
earth. Someone has said that if the earth were cut off from all solar radiation
for a single month, all life would be extinguished and the world become a
frozen waste. It is not so evident, but as clearly true, that the energy stored in
wood, coal, oil, and gas has come to us from the sun. Under the infiuence of
sunlight, particularly of the red and blue components, the carbon dioxide of
the atmosphere is taken in by the leaves of trees and plants and acted upon to
form the complex constituents of plant growth, mainly compounds of carbon
with hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Their chemical transformation requires
the absorption of energy which is accumulated and stored in these compounds,
to be released and again transformed when they are burned rapidly in ordinary
combustion, or slowly in our own bodies. Every heart beat, every breath we
take, every thought, and every act performed draws its working power from the
accumulated solar energy stored up in plant and animal growth. The trans-
formation of solar energy in plant growth takes place in the leaves under the
action of sunlight upon the green coloring matter, the chlorophyll. As heat
engines plants cannot be considered efficient, transforming as they do only 1
or 2 percent of the solar energy falling upon their leaves, but the energy supplied
is enormous; plants work continually during growth and store up energy in
permanent form; these are favorable conditions and result in tremendous ad-
vantages for man. The energy of coal has waited for his touch many millions
of years and what, if any, escapes his wasteful use will endure uncounted
millions yet without loss of its potential energy. The energy of the sun is
stored in the water lifted into the atmosphere by the sun’s power and carried
by wind-driven clouds to higher regions, whence it falls as rain or snow, ever
renewing the reservoirs and so rendering them a practically exhaustless source
of power.

The exact amount of solar radiation is known mainly from the
measurements made by the observers of the Smithsonian Institution,
Dr. C. G. Abbot and his collaborators, at Washington, D. C., and at
various stations on the globe. On each square centimeter of a sphere
whose radius is the mean distance of the earth from the sun, falls 1.9
calories per minute. The distance of the sun from the earth is 93
million miles, and from this we can readily find the enormous amount
of energy released by a square centimeter of the surface of the sun,
about 1,500 calories per second. By the laws of radiation we may
then calculate the effective temperature of the solar surface to be
about 5,700°. The mass of the sun is 382,000 times the mass of the
earth, and we may conclude that on the average each gram of the
solar mass loses 1.4 calories per year. During a few thousand mil-
lion years, which we assume to be the age of the sun, the amount
becomes tremendous.

There have been different theories as to the origin of the energ
output of the sun. We have had mechanical theories which assume
that the source of energy is the kinetic energy of meteorites captured
by the sun, or the potential energy lost by the shrinking of the entire
body of the sun in a process of contraction. We know now beyond
doubt that the main source of energy is of inner-atomic origin. In
the interior of the sun the temperature and density must increase
immensely toward the center. The mass of the interior consists
mainly of hydrogen and helium in fairly equal amounts, whereas the
amount of all other elements together is only about 12 percent of the
entire mass. All elements will be in a high stage of ionization. The
ionized hydrogen atoms, or protons, will fairly often hit each other,
as well as the nuclei of other atoms, and if the impact carries suffi-

cient energy a nuclear reaction may take place.
