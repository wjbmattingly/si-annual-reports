ANNUAL REPORT OF THE.PERMANENT COMMITTEE.

Senator Henderson, chairman, made the following report in regard
to the condition of the various matters under the charge of the com-
mittee:

There were no new developments during the year with regard to the Avery fund
or the Sprague bequest. »

THE HODGKINS FUND.

Progress has been made in the suit of O’ Donaghue v. Smith. An appeal was taken
to the general term from the decision of the trial justice who allowed the verdict in
favor of the daughter of Mr. 0’ Donaghue, who was an infant at the time of partition.
The general term affirmed the action of the justice below, which has caused delay.
The Smithsonian counsel, Mr. Hackett, is now ready to proceed with the hearing of
the case.

During the year the house and lot at Elizabeth, N. J. has been sold to advantage.

THE ANDREWS BEQUEST.

A preliminary contest is now going on before a referee upon the question whether
one-half of Mr. Andrews’s estate should not go to his heirs by reason of an alleged
violation of the statutes of 1860, preventing a testator from giving to a charitable cor-
poration more than one-half of his estate, after payment of debts. Mr. Hackett is of
the opinion that the Institution’s prospects for success continue fair.

THE REID BEQUEST.

During the year the Institution was supplied with a copy of the will of the late
Addison T. Reid, of Brooklyn, N. Y., who died on September 15, 1902. The will
provides for the payment of the income upon the property to persons named, and
upon their death, for the payment of the principal of the estate, with accumulations,
to the Smithsonian. Institution, to found a chair in biology in memory of the testator’s

grandfather, Asher Tunis. The will was admitted to probate by the surrogate of
King’s County on December 10, 1902. The estate is valued at $10,000.

STATEMENT OF FUNDS USED IN EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT.

On November 9, 1898, the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications of
the War Department made an allotment of $25,000 for carrying on
experiments in mechanical flight, and on December 16, 1899, supple-
mented this by another allotment of $25,000. These funds lasted
until October 15, 1901. Commencing October 16, 1901, and continu-
ing until June 15, 1902, the sum of $5,565.75 was used in carrying on
this work from the special funds received from Dr. Alexander Graham
Bell and the late Dr. J. H. Kidder, for researches to be conducted
personally by the Secretary.

Since June 16, 1902, expenditures for work in mechanical flight
have been made from the Hodgkins fund in accordance with the reso-
lution of the Board of Regents of January 26, 1898; and for this pur-
pose from June 16 to December 31, 1902, the sum of $6,558.61 has
been used for continuing these experiments.

RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO INCOME AND EXPENDITURE.

Senator Henderson, as chairman of the executive committee, intro-
duced the following customary resolution:

Resolved, That the income of the institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1904, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Sec-
retary with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion on the part
of the Secretary as to items.

On motion the resolution was adopted.

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON NEEDS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL
MUSEUM.

Senator Platt, as chairman of the special committee appointed at
the last annual meeting, submitted the following report:

The committee of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, appointed
in accordance with a resolution of the Board ‘‘to represent to Congress the pressing
necessity of additional room for the proper exhibition of specimens belonging to
the National Museum,’’ have examined the plans prepared under the direction of the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in accordance with the provisions of the
sundry civil appropriation act approved June 28, 1902.

The committee adopted the following motion:

““That under the limitations of the law the committee hereby report to Congress
plan B for a new National Museum building as the best obtainable for the amount
mentioned; but in the judgment of the committee the larger plan A is believed to
be the one which should be adopted, and we, therefore, ask that Congress shall make
the appropriation for it instead of for the smaller plan.”

But if an appropriation for the construction of a building upon the larger plan can
not be made now, the committee respectfully urge upon Congress an appropriation.
of $1,500,000 to construct that portion of the completed plan shown in Plan B. They
further represent to Congress the fact that collections of the greatest value are in
immediate danger of destruction, and are now actually undergoing degeneration in
the present unsuitable, unsafe, temporary quarters, and that the erection of a new
building is absolutely necessary for the preservation of the national collections,

Respectfully submitted.

Members of the Special Committee of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

After discussion, on motion of Mr. Adams, it was

Resolved, That the report of the committee be adopted, and that they be instructed
to proceed to bring the matter to a conclusion by securing an appropriation.

The Secretary announced the death on September 23, 1902, of Major
John W. Powell, Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, and his
appointment on October 11, of Mr. William H. Holmes as Chief of

the Bureau, and made a statement as to the present status of the
Bureau and its future policy.
XVIII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

He spoke of the work of the Zoological Park, of the Bureau of Inter-
national Exchanges, and of the Astrophysical Observatory. He also
spoke of the National Museum’s needs, and of the efforts being made
to secure a new building. He then gave a brief statement of his con-
nection with the Carnegie Institution.

The Secretary submitted to the Board a proposition to add $25,000
of accumulated interest from the unrestricted funds of the Institution
to the permanent fund, and after an explanation, Senator Henderson
offered the following resolution:

Resolved, That the Secretary is hereby authorized to deposit in the Treasury of the
United States, under the terms of section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, as an addition
to the permanent fund of the Institution, the sum of $25,000 from the unexpended
balance.

On motion the resolution was adopted.

By resolution of the Board a special committee of five, consisting of
the Chancellor, Senators Cullom and Platt, and Representatives Adams
and Dinsmore was appointed to consider the question of specifically
defining the powers of the executive committee, to report at a special
meeting called for March 12, 1903.

A special meeting of the Board of Regents was held on March 12, at
10 o’clock a. m.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, Chancellor, in the chair: the
Hon. William P. Frye, the Hon. O. H. Platt, the Hon. F. M. Cock-
rel], the Hon. R. R. Hitt, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the Hon. Hugh
A. Dinsmore, the Hon. John B. Henderson, the Hon. George Gray,
Dr. A. Graham Bell; and the Secretary, Mr. §, P. Langley.

The Secretary read letters from Senator Cullom and Doctor Angell,
stating that their engagements prevented their attendance. He had
no word from Mr. Olney, who had said, however, at the annual meet-
ing that it would probably be impracticable for him to attend on this
occasion. Doctor White was absent in Europe.

The Chancellor reported informally upon the duties heretofore dis-
charged by the executive committee. No definite conclusion had been
reached as to the question of defining the powers of that committee,
but it was thought desirable that it should hold regular meetings and
that the Board of Regents should hold two stated meetings in addition
to the annual meeting prescribed by law. It was therefore—

Resolved, That, in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the fourth Wednes-
day in January, regular meetings of the Board shall be held on the Tuesday after the
first Monday in December and on the 6th day of March, unless that date falls on
Sunday, when the following Monday shall be substituted.

The special committee was continued, with a request to further
pursue the examination of the whole subject and to report at the
December meeting.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIX

Senator Platt read the following clause from the sundry civil act,
approved March 3, 1903:

Building for National Museum: To enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion to commence the erection of a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts, for
the use of the National Museum, to be erected on the north side of the Mall, between
Ninth and Twelfth streets northwest, substantially in accordance with the Plan A,
prepared and submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
under the provisions of the act approved June twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred and
two, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Said building complete, including
heating and ventilating apparatus and elevators, shall cost not to exceed three mil-
lion five hundred thousand dollars, and a contract or contracts for its completion is
hereby authorized to be entered into, subject to appropriations to be made by Con-
gress. The construction shall be in charge of Bernard R. Green, Superintendent of
Buildings and Grounds, Library of Congress, who shall make the contracts herein
authorized and disburse all appropriations made for the work, and shall receive as
full compensation for his services hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annu-
ally in addition to his present salary, to be paid out of said appropriations.

Senator Platt suggested that the Secretary be authorized to repre-
sent the Board of Regents in carrying out the provisions of this clause;
and, after a very full discussion of the subject, the following resolution
was adopted:

Resolved, That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the Chancellor and
the Chairman of the Executive Committee, be authorizod to represent the Board of
Regents so far as may be necessary in consultation with Bernard R. Green, to whom
the construction and contracts for the new Museum building are committed by Con-
gress in the act making an appropriation for that purpose.

Mr. Bell introduced resolutions providing for appointments under
the Institution, which were referred to the special committee already
existing.

On the motion of Senator Cockrell, it was—

Resolved, That the Secretary cause to be prepared a compilation of all laws or parts
of laws referring to or in any manner affecting the Smithsonian Institution and the
Bureaus under its charge, including all appropriations by Congress for its purposes
or use,

Referring to previous action of the Board concerning the removal
of the remains of James Smithson to this country, Mr. Bell offered to
bring them to the United States if the Regents would care for them
thereafter, and after remarks the suggestion was accepted that Mr.
Bell renew his inquiry at the next meeting.

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, L908,

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith my report, show-
ing the operations of the Institution during the year ending June 30,
1903, including the work placed under its direction by Congress in the
United States National Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology,
the International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the
Astrophysical Observatory.

Following the precedent of several years, there is given, in the body
of this report, a general account of the affairs of the Institution and
its bureaus, while the appendix presents more detailed statements by
the persons in direct charge of the different branches of the work.
Independently of this, the operations of the National Museum are
fully treated in a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report, and the
Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology constitutes a volume
prepared under the supervision of the Chief of that Bureau.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

By act of Congress approved August 10, 1846, the Smithsonian
Institution was created an Establishment. Its statutory members are
the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice of the United
States, and the heads of the Executive Departments. The preroga-
tive of the Establishment is ‘the supervision of the affairs of the
Institution and the advice and the instruction of the Board of Regents.”

A vacancy continues to exist in the Establishment caused by the
succession to the Presidency of Vice-President Roosevelt. By the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

As organized on June 30, 1903, the Establishment consisted of the
following ex officio members:
THEODORE RoosEvetr, President of the United States.
(Vacancy), Vice-President of the United States.
MeELviItLte W. Fuuuer, Chief Justice of the United States.
Joun Hay, Secretary of State.
Lesitiz M. Suaw, Secretary of the Treasury.
Evinvu Roor, Secretary of War.

Witit1am H. Moopy, Secretary of the Navy.
Ernan Auten Hircoucock, Secretary of the Interior.
JAMES WiLson, Secretary of Agriculture.
GrorGE B. Cortetyou, Secretary of Commerce and Labor.

BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Board of Regents consists of the Vice-President and the Chief
Justice of the United States as ex officio members, three members of
the Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, and six
citizens, ‘‘two of whom shall be residents of the city of Washington
and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State, but no two of
them of the same State.”

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 28, 1903, at 10
o'clock a. m.

The following is an abstract of its proceedings, which will be found
in detail in the annual report of the Board to Congress:

The Secretary presented his annual report of the operations of the
Institution and its several dependencies for. the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1902, and the Board adopted the annual report of the execu-
tive committee to the same date, showing in detail the financial condi-
tion of the Institution. The usual resolution relative to income and
expenditure was adopted.

Senator Henderson, chairman of the permanent committee, reported
upon the expenditures incurred by the Secretary under the authority
of the Board of Regents in continuing his experiments on mechanical
flight. Statements were made in regard to the proposed bequest of
Addison T. Reid; also concerning the will of Wallace C. Andrews and
the status of the residuary legacy under the Hodgkins will.

Senator Platt; chairman of the special committee, appointed in
. accordance with a resolution of the Board—

‘*to represent to Congress the pressing necessity of additional room
for the proper exhibition of specimens belonging to the National
Museum ”—
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

reported that the committee had examined the plans prepared under
the direction of the Secretary, as provided in the sundry civil act of
June 28, 1902, and recommended that if an appropriation for the
entire new building could not be made now the committee would
respectfully urge upon Congress an appropriation of $1,500,000 to
construct a portion of the completed plan. The committee further
urged that Congress be advised of the fact that collections of the
greatest value are in immediate danger of destruction, and are now
actually undergoing degeneration in the present unsuitable, unsafe,
temporary quarters, and that the erection of a new building is abso-
lutely necessary. for the preservation of the national collections. The
members of the committee, in addition to the chairman, were Senators
Cullom and Cockrell and Representatives Hitt, Adams, and Dinsmore.
The report of the committee was adopted and they were instructed to
bring the matter to a conclusion by securing an appropriation.

The Secretary announced to the Board the death, on September 23,
1902, of Maj. J. W. Powell, of the Bureau of Ethnology, and the
appointment on October 11 of Mr. William H. Holmes, and made a
statement as to the status of the Bureau and its future policy.

On motion of Senator Henderson, the Secretary was—

‘‘authorized to deposit in the Treasury of the United States, under
the terms of section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, as an addition to
the permanent fund of the Institution, the sum of $25,000 from the
unexpended balance.”

By resolution of the Board a special committee of five, consisting
of the Chancellor, Senators Cullom and Platt, and Representatives
Adams and Dinsmore, was appointed to consider the question of
specifically defining the powers of the executive committee, to report
at a special meeting called for March 12, 1903.

The special meeting was held on March 12, when the Chancellor
reported informally upon the duties heretofore discharged by the
executive committee. No definite conclusion had been reached as to
the question of defining the powers of that committee, but it was
thought desirable that it should hold regular meetings and that the
Board of Regents should hold two stated meetings in addition to the
annual meeting prescribed by law. It was therefore resolved—

“That, in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the fourth
W ednesday in January, regular meetings of the Board shall be held
on the Tuesday after the first Monday in December and on the 6th day
of March, unless that date falls on Sunday, when the following Mon-
day shall be substituted.”

The special committee was continued, with a request to further
pursue the examination of the whole subject and to report at the
December meeting.

Senator Platt read a clause from the sundry civil act approved March
4. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

8, 1903, authorizing the Regents to commence the erection of a new
building for the National Museum, to cost not to exceed $3,500,000,
and to make contracts for its completion subject to appropriations by
Congress. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars was appropriated
to begin the work, the construction to be in charge of Bernard R.
Green, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, Library of Congress.
The resolution adopted by the Board will be found on page 17, under
the heading ‘* National Museum.”

Mr. Bell introduced resolutions providing for appointments under
the Institution, which were referred to the special committee already
existing.

Upon motion of Senator Cockrell, the Secretary was authorized to
cause to be prepared a compilation of all laws or parts of laws referring
to or in any manner affecting the Smithsonian Institution and the
bureaus under its charge, including all appropriations by Congress for
its purpose or use.

Referring to previous action of the Board concerning the removal of
the remains of James Smithson to this country, Mr. Bell offered to
bring them to the United States if the Regents would care for them
thereafter, and after remarks the suggestion was accepted that Mr.
Bell renew his inquiry at-the next meeting.

ORGANIZATION OF BOARD OF REGENTS.

As organized at the end of the fiscal year, the Board of Regents con-
sisted of the following members:

The Hon. M. W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States, Chan-
cellor; the Hon. W. P. Frye, President pro tempore of the United
States Senate; Senator S. M. Cullom; Senator O. H. Platt; Senator
Francis M. Cockrell; Representative R. R. Hitt; Representative Rob-
ert Adams, jr.; Representative Hugh A. Dinsmore; Dr. James B.
Angell; Dr. Andrew D. White; the Hon. J. B. Henderson; Prof. A.
Graham Bell; the Hon. Richard Olney, and the Hon. George Gray.

ADMINISTRATION.

The general supervision of the business of the several dependencies
placed by Congress under the direction of the Institution has year by
year required my increased attention, although as far as practicable
the carrying out of details has been left to those in immediate charge
of the work of the bureaus.

In view of the great development in the science of ethnology during
recent years it seemed desirable that the work of the Bureau of Amer-
ican Ethnology should be reorganized, and in order that I might have
full knowledge of the needs of that Bureau a committee was appointed
to secure detailed information from those engaged in that branch of
the Institution’s activities, and to make recommendations based upon
the results of their observations. The committee began this work
toward the close of the fiscal year,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5
BUILDINGS.

Certain much-needed repairs to the main roof of the Smithsonian
building are in progress, and in this connection it seems important to
again call attention to the necessity of a reconstruction of the ceiling
and other renovations of the large Anthropological Hall, whose noble
dimensions deserve a worthier treatment, and of improving the access
to it.

In the paragraphs devoted to the Museum and to the Zoological
Park mention is made of building improvements during the year.

FINANCES.

Under the provisions cf the act organizing the Institution and the
act of Congress approved March 12, 1894, the above fund is deposited
in the Treasury of the United States and bears interest at 6 per cent
per annum. In addition to the permanent fund, the regents hold
certain approved railroad bonds, which form part of the fund estab-
lished by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations into the properties of
atmospheric air.

The unexpended balance at the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1,
1902, as stated in my last report, was $81,120.91. The total receipts
by the Institution during the year were $67,835.37. Of this sum,
$56,400 was derived from interest and the remaining $11,435.37 was
received from miscellaneous sources.

The disbursements during the year amounted to $93,448.61, the
details of which are given in the report of the executive committee.
This amount includes the sum of $25,000 which, in accordance with a
resolution of the Board of Regents adopted at the last annual meeting,
was drawn from the current funds and deposited in the Treasury of
the United States to the credit of the permanent fund. The balance
remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1903, for the
expenses of the Institution was $55,507.67. A considerable part of

RESEARCH.

It was a part of the original plan of the Institution that its Secretary
should not give his time wholly to administrative duties, but should
directly aid in its scientific investigations.

Research work in various fields of science has been continued by
the Institution and its dependencies.

I have made some progress toward the solution of the problem of
mechanical flight, and have been carrying on, with the consent of the
Regents, some experiments for the War Department, at its expense,
and am adding other experiments, partly at the expense of the Insti-
tution.

In the Astrophysical Observatory I have continued work believed
to be important, and inaugurated some experiments of novel interest,
which are referred to later.

Through the Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology the
Institution has been enabled to carry on various biological and ethno-
logical researches, which will be found fully described elsewhere in
this report and need not be repeated here.

HODGKINS FUND.

Reports giving the final results of some important investigations
which have been prosecuted by the aid of the Hodgkins fund and
others, giving the details of the progress of researches still incomplete,
have been received. Several of these memoirs have already been
issued by the Institution, and others are in course of publication.

The second memoir by Dr. Carl Barus, referred to in my last report
as supplementary to the investigation on ionized air, has been pub-
lished as one of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, under
the title ** The Structure of the Nucleus.” Questions necessarily left
outstanding in the first memoir are answered in the second, the two
volumes forming together a valuable contribution to the literature of
the subject.

The thermometric researches of Prof. M. W. Travers, of University
College, London, have been reported on in a memoir entitled ‘‘On
the Attainment of Very Low Temperatures,” which’ is now in course
of publication. It is the design of Professor Travers to prosecute his
investigation still further, and the question of another grant for the
purpose has been submitted for consideration.

The research on vacuum spectroscopy, by Dr. Victor Schumann, of
Leipzig, has been reported on in detail in a memoir soon to be issued
as one of the Contributions to Knowledge. The special apparatus,

8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which has been both designed and constructed by Doctor Schumann
for conducting this advanced and difficult research, is described in his
report. The interest among specialists in this investigation has been
so general that the Institution has permitted Doctor Schumann to pub-
lish without delay significant discoveries made in the course of his
experiments, on the condition of announcing them at the same time to
the Institution and mentioning the relation of his work to the Hodg-
kins fund.

In February, 1908, Prof. E. W. Scripture, of Yale University, whose
special researches relative to speech or phonetics have called attention
to his work, received a Hodgkins grant for the construction of a
‘*vowel machine,” which, when perfected, he hopes will be equivalent
to devising a perfect yox humana stop for the organ, which may
replace the one now in use. In accordance with the rule of the insti-
tution the application for this grant was referred for an opinion to
the highest accessible authority before approval.

A grant in form of a subscription for a specified number of copies
of the journal Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity
has been again approved, it being apparent that the publication is of
service to the specialists and educational establishments that have been
placed on the list to receive it through the Institution.

Any general allotment of the income from the Hodgkins fund is
precluded by the terms of the bequest, but it may be again repeated
that every request for such assistance receives attention, and an
application by an investigator who is able to comply with the con-
ditions established in accordance with the will of the donor is sure of
serious consideration.

NAPLES TABLE.

The contract for the Smithsonian Table in the Naples Zoological
Station, which was extended from June 30, 1902, through December
of that year, has been again renewed for one year from January 1, 1902.

The applications for the Smithsonian seat have been so numerous
and so urgent that the Institution felt called on to engage another table
fora part of the year. This, however, Doctor Dohrn could not arrange
for, but with his. usual kindness he promised in any event to accom-
modate all the Smithsonian appointees. He has not only done this,
but in several instances has exceeded the requests of the Institution.
During the period from March 1 till July 1, 1903, the table had con-
stantly two occupants. It should be added that whenever the dates of
applications interfered with each other the approval of the Secretary
was accorded, with the understanding that the tenure of the seat should
be subject to such modification as might be suggested by the Director
of the Station.

Dr. C. W. Prentiss, of Harvard University, whose application for
an extension of his occupancy was noted in my last report, remained
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

at the Station on the invitation of Doctor Dohrn, pending a decision as
to the renewal of the Smithsonian lease. His occupancy was after-
wards extended until August 1, making a session of five consecutive
months. Preliminary mention of his research has been received from
Doctor Prentiss, in which he speaks of the exceptional opportunities
afforded at Naples for obtaining valuable living material for his
researches.

During the summer of 1902 Dr. T. H. Morgan, of Bryn Mawr
College, filled another short appointment at the table, and has since
transmitted to the Institution copies of two published memoirs detail-
ing the results of his work.

Dr. C. M. Child, of the University of Chicago, occupied the Smith-
sonian seat from July 1 till December 31, 1902. His report, which
indicates briefly the results of his work without extended discussion,
1s to be published in the first quarterly issue of the Smithsonian Mis-
cellaneous Collections, together with the other papers which have been
submitted, in accordance with the request of the Institution, for this
purpose by those who have recently occupied the Smithsonian seat.

Dr. C. S. Minot, of Harvard University, who filled an appointment
from October 15 till December 15, 1902, reports that his time at Naples
was devoted to procuring series of embryos of Torpedo ocellata, Mus-
telus levis, Petromyzon, and Amphiorus, and also young specimens of
Pristiurus and Seyllium. Doctor Minot also refers to the ample
resources of the Station, which enabled him te obtain fine series in
varefully selected stages of development. These specimens have been
arranged in serial sections and placed in the Harvard embryological
collection, where they will be open to all competent investigators and
will serve for many years for studies in comparative embryology.

Prof. F. M. MacFarland, of Leland Stanford Junior University,
occupied the Table for five months from November 1, 1902. This was
Professor MacFarland’s second term of occupancy, he having been
appointed to the seat for three months in the spring and summer of
1896.

Dr. C. B. Davenport, of the University of Chicago, held the seat for
parts of November and December, 1902. In a report promptly sub-
mitted at the termination of his occupancy, Doctor Davenport says
that during his short period at Naples he made an investigation into
the development of the color pattern and specitic markings of the shell
of Pecten jacobaeus, P. varius, and P. pusio, having also gathered
materials for a quantitative variation study of the shells of this
species.

Prof. C. W. Hargitt, of Syracuse University, the approval of whose
application was necessarily postponed awaiting a decision as to the
renewal of the lease, received the appointment for March, April, and
May of the current year, during which time he completed a research
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

on the early development of EKudendrium. <A brief summary of the
work of Doctor Hargitt has been received and will appear in the first
quarterly issue of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. A
more detailed report is to be published later in the Zoologisches
Jahrbuch.

Dr. C. H. Bardeen, associate professor of anatomy in Johns Hopkins
University, occupied the Smithsonian seat during the months of April,
May, and June, 1903, for the purpose of making experimental inves-
tigations in embryological development.

In view of the exceptional opportunity for special research afforded
at the Naples Station, which is frequently mentioned appreciatively
in the reports submitted by the appointees of the Institution, the Sec-
retary is glad to have found it practicable to renew again the lease of
the Smithsonian Table, which he hopes on the expiration of the present
contract to be in a position to extend for another term of years.

The submission by a Smithsonian appointee of a brief summary of
the work done at Naples is an appreciated courtesy, but it may be
again stated that should an investigator desire to publish the results of
his work on his own responsibility, a copy of his memoir has always
been deemed sufficient for the purpose of the Institution, which is
chiefly to make suitable reference in the annual report to the often
noteworthy work of those occupying the Smithsonian seat.

It may be said that while the summary of the scientific history of
an applicant, which it is customary to submit with a request for an
appointment, is often unnecessary as a means of acquainting the Insti-
tution with the work of an investigator, such a sketch is of service in
completing the files of the Institution relative to each appointee, and
an abstract of the data thus submitted is transmitted to Doctor Dohrn,
with each notice of an approved application, for the files of the zoo-
logical station.

Dr. T. H. Morgan, of Bryn Mawr, who has several times filled vacan-
cies caused by the absence of members of the advisory committee,
courteously consented again to supply the place of Prof. E. B. Wilson,
during his absence in Europe from February till September, 1903.
With this exception the personnel of the committee has been unchanged
during the year. It gives me pleasure to record again my apprecia-
tion of the aid rendered me by the committee in all questions relating
to appointments to the Smithsonian table.

EXPLORATIONS.

The Institution has continued to carry on various biological and
ethnological explorations through the medium of the National Museum
and the Bureau of American Ethnology, and has also cooperated with
the Executive Departments in these directions. The details of most
of these explorations are given in the paragraphs devoted to the sey-
eral bureaus.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ih
PUBLICATIONS.

The Institution issued during the year a total of 45,506 volumes or
separates of the series of Contributions, Miscellaneous Collections,
Reports, and publications not included in the regular series.“ The
document division received for action a total of 8,522 letters and cards
of acknowledgment.

In the publications of the Institution the double aim of its founder
is represented, in that it should exist for (1) the ‘* increase” and (2) the
‘* diffusion” of knowledge.

The recording of results of original researches, the ‘* increase” of
knowledge, is chiefly through the series of Contributions to Knowledge,
a quarto work begun in 1848, and in which more than 140 valuable
memoirs, collected in 32 volumes, have so far been published. There
has been added to this series during the year a memoir of 190 pages by
Dr. Carl Barus on the Structure of the Nucleus, a continuation of his
experiments with ionized air, which were described in a memoir pub-
lished during the previous year.

In the present investigation the author answers certain practical
questions suggested by his last memoir in relation to phosphorus when
used as a source of nuclei; i. e., of extremely small particles tending
to precipitate water from moist air when this is suddenly cooled. It
is, however, the chief aim of the memoir to throw light on the phe-
nomena connected with the presence of nuclei in air by aid of the coro-
nas or color rings seen in such air when its moisture is condensed and
deposited on the nuclei and a distant source of light is looked at
through the turbid medium. As these coronas occur in great variety
and size they lend themselves to measurement when other means fail.
A systematic study is therefore made at the outset of the number of
particles corresponding to all well-defined members of the sequence of
coronas obtained under known conditions of supersaturated air. The
numbers run from less than 100 to upy vard of 50,000 per cubic centi-
meter.

The results are then applied in an endeavor to find the velocity of
the nucleus by nonelectrical methods, both of a direct and an indirect
kind, utilizing the fact that if nuclei leave the medium the coronas
obtained under like conditions must change correspondingly. Through-
out the latter part of the investigation the nuclei are purposely pro-
duced in the simplest manner possible, by shaking solutions in air;
but in the course of the investigation the author reaches conclusions
which seem to show that the solutional nucleus is of much broader
meteorological significance in its bearing on atmospheric condensation
and electricity than has heretofore been anticipated. It appears that

«Contributions to Knowledge, 1,983; Miscellaneous Collections, 11,667; Reports,
26,237; publications not in regular series, 5,619.
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in an unbounded region of the atmosphere saturated with water this
nucleus must be a persistent structure. This he finds is strikingly
apparent even when the air is saturated with very volatile liquids other
than water.

In conclusion, the author points out that the size of the nucleus must
vary with the medium in which it is suspended, and that water nuclei
in particular will depend for their dimensions on the meteorological
status of the atmosphere. Finally, the importance of correlating this
variation of nuclear diameter with the electrical activity of the water
nucleus is insisted on, with a view to its possible application to atmos-
pheric electricity.

A memoir by Dr. Victor Schumann on the absorption and emis-
sion of air and its ingredients for light of wave lengths from 250 py
to 100 wyawas put in type during the year, but the presswork was not
completed.

This memoir, which forms the concluding part of Volume X XIX
of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, gives an account of
researches, aided by grants from the Hodgkins fund, on the emission
and absorption of the gases of atmospheric air in the ultraviolet
spectrum. Within the last fifteen years our knowledge of radiation
has been greatly increased, and now embraces wide ranges of the
spectrum heretofore unknown. Without assigning any place to the
numerous kinds of ‘‘ rays” whose discovery has been associated in the
public mind first with the work of Réntgen and later with that of the
Curies, Lam speaking here rather of the extensions of the spectrum
in wave lengths which are actually measurable and known. Thus
beyond the red the spectrum has now been studied in practical conti-
nuity to a wave length of nearly 100 microns; and at a great remove
beyond this is another known region embracing the so-called Hertzian
or electric waves now employed in wireless telegraphy. Beyond the
violet progress has been, relatively speaking, less rapid, unless, indeed,
it shall prove that the Réntgen and other radiations fall in this region.
But a great step in advance has been made by the unwearied investi-
gations of the author of the present work, Doctor Schumann.

The difficulties hindering research in the ultraviolet are great and
consist chiefly in the opacity of the usual optical media to the short
wave-length rays. Quartz, for a long time considered best in this
part of the spectrum, is found to be too opaque, and has been largely
superseded in Doctor Schumann’s inyestigations by fluorspar for
prisms and plates. Air, even in layers of a few millimeters’ thick-
ness, is almost wholly opaque, and other gases absorb strongly. It
has, therefore, been necessary to employ a spectroscope from which
the air is exhausted: to the highest practicable degree; and this and
other necessary apparatus Doctor Schumann has designed and con-
structed with his own hands, though aided by grants from the Hodg-
kins fund of the Smithsonian Institution.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

The memoir contains an account of the special apparatus and
method of using it, and continues with a description of the emission
and absorption spectra of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon monox-
ide and dioxide and aqueous vapor for wave lengths, reaching in the
case of hydrogen to about 0.10 micron. Illustrations of the apparatus
and spectra accompany the text, and it is thought the whole will be a
valuable contribution to knowledge, though but preliminary to the
researches Doctor Schumann alone is continuing in this spectral
region.

The Institution has accepted, for publication in the Contributions
to Knowledge, a memoir by Dr. Frederick W. True, entitled ‘‘ The
whalebone whales of the western North Atlantic, compared with those
occurring in European waters, with some observations on the species
of the North Pacific.” This memoir will make a volume of about 200
pages of text, accompanied by about 50 full-page plates illustrating
the anatomy and habits of the various species described.

For many years I have had a hope of preparing for publication a work
consisting essentially of photographic views of the moon so complete
and, it was expected (with the advance of photography), so minute,
that the features of our satellite might be studied by the geologist and
the selenographer nearly as well as by the astronomer at the telescope.
This hope has been disappointed, for photography, which has made
such eminent advances in the reproduction of nebule and other celes-
tial features, has stood comparatively still in lunar work. We indeed
have far better views than were obtained by Rutherford, but the very
best even of the admirable ones recently procured by Professor
Ritchey at the Yerkes Observatory have proved so far behind what
the eye can directly discern with the telescope that the expectation
that such a work could be advantageously published has been, after a
great deal of labor and preparation for many years, most reluctantly
abandoned. During the past year, however, a memoir has been sub-
mitted to the Institution by Prof. N. S. Shaler, of Cambridge, entitled
‘** A Comparison of the Features of the Earth and the Moon.” It will
be published with some of the best illustrations gathered for the for-
mer purpose, and about 25 of these illustratiens of the moon’s surface,
including many of the photographs taken by Professor Ritchey, will
form a prominent feature. The work will probably appear in the
early part of the ensuing year.

In 1864 the Institution published in the series of Contributions to
Knowledge a memoir by Prof. Henry Draper on the Construction of
a Silvered Glass Telescope. The book has long been out of print, and
as there seemed to be a present demand fora new edition arrange-
ments have been made for its reissue, accompanied by an article by a
competent hand bringing the subject to date.

To the series of Miscellaneous Collections two short papers were
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

added during the year, and several papers were accepted and progress
made toward their publication. Among the accepted papers may be
mentioned an Index to the Literature of Thorium, 1817-1902, by
Dr. Cavalier H. Joiiet; a Second Supplement to Select Bibliography
of Chemistry, by Dr. H. C. Bolton, bringing the subject down to close
of the year 1902; Researches on the Attainment of Very Low Tem-
peratures, by Prof. Morris W. Travers, of University College, Lon-
don, and a paper by Dr. Amadeus W. Grabau, on the phylogeny or
tribal history of Fusus and its allies, being a very complete description
of the various fossil and recent genera and species classed by conchol-
ogists under the name Fusus.

Among the proposed publications may be mentioned an elaborate
work by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode on ‘** What has been done in
America for Science.”” Doctor Goode left the manuscript nearly com-
pleted, and arrangements have been made to bring it to date and to
put it in condition for printing.

The revised edition of the Smithsonian Physical Tables, issued in
1897, having become exhausted, and the demand continuing, a second
edition was printed in January, 1903.

Arrangements have been made fora quarterly issue of the Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections in order to afford a medium for the prompt
publication of brief accounts of the results of researches by the Insti-
tution and its bureaus, especially those of a preliminary nature,
together with such notices concerning the Institution and its activities
as may be of general public interest. Each issue will consist of about
140 pages of text and will be amply illustrated. The quarterly issue
will supplement, not replace, the regular series of the Miscellaneous
Collections.

Mention has heretofore been made of the character of papers pub-
lished in the General Appendix of the Regents’ Report to Congress.
This report, to waich I have given much personal care, is the only
Smithsonian publication issued in large numbers, and yet the popular
demand for it is far in excess of the edition of 12,000 copies authorized
by law. The volume for 1901 was received from the Public Printer
early in the autumn of 1902 and in a very few weeks every available
copy was distributed. It is desirable that a larger edition should be
authorized.

The manuscript for the 1902 report was sent to the Public Printer
in May, 1903, and most of it was in type before June 30.

Besides the above publications of the Institution itself a large num-
ber of works on anthropological, biological, and geological subjects,
issued by the National Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology,
are referred to in detail in appendices to this report. There was also
sent to press a report by the Astrophysical Observatory on the solar
eclipse expedition of 1900, The Secretary of the Institution received
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

and submitted to Congress, in accordance with their acts of incorpo-
ration, the annual reports of the American Historical Association and
of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress
during the year were 1,848 volumes, 21,282 parts of volumes, 3,804
pamphlets, and 379 charts, or a total of 27,313, being an increase of
675 over the previous year, and extending the accession numbers of
the Smithsonian deposit to 452,465. The libraries of the Secretary,
Office and of the Astrophysical Observatory show an increase of 409
volumes, pamphlets, and charts, and 1,625 parts of volumes, making
the total Smithsonian library accessions of the year 29,347. The
serial publications entered on the card catalogue number 24,630.

Gen. John Watts De Peyster has added to his large collection of
books and pamphlets relating to Napoleon Bonaparte, and has also pre-
sented a collection of works on gypsies, a collection of dictionaries and
encyclopedias, many of which are very rare, besides several portraits,
pictures, and paintings.

The National Museum library now contains 19,161 bound volumes
and 32,063 unbound papers. The accessions during the year were
3,161 books, 3,260 pamphlets, and 303 parts of volumes, which include
two important gifts—the E. A. Schwarz collection of books on Ameri-
can Coleoptera and the W. H. Dall collection of books on recent and
fossil mollusks. The librarian refers to these gifts in some detail in his
report in the Appendix.

The Institution has continued to aid in the maintenance of the Inter-
national Catalogue of Scientific Literature, and a total of 14,480 ref-
erences were furnished to the central bureau during the year. Five
volumes of the Catalogue were received and distributed.

CORRESPONDENCE.

The correspondence of the Secretary’s office embraces not only com-
munications referring to the work of the Institution proper, but also
to the National Museum, the International Exchanges, the Bureau of
American Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
physical Observatory.

Subjects of inquiry by correspondents are perhaps more varied and
embrace a wider range of topics than obtains in other departments of
the Government, yet all are promptly answered.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Hamilton fund.—I have given consideration to the difficult subject
of the useful disposition of the small Hamilton fund, the income of
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which it is hoped to apply to a biennial lecture, but no arrangements
have yet been perfected for its delivery.

Gifts.— Among the gifts received by the Institution during the year
may be mentioned a large oil painting, **The March of Time,” pre-
sented by the artist, Mr. Henry Sandham, representing many of the
principal generals of the civil war.

Louisiana Purchase Exposition.—Congress having made an appro-
priation for a Government building and exhibit at the exposition to
be held in St. Louis in 1904, the Secretary has appointed Doctor True
to represent the Institution and its bureaus in the preparation and
installation of its exhibits.

Congress of Americanists.—Mr. F. W. Hodge was. delegated to
represent the Institution at the thirteenth session of the International
Congress of Americanists, held at New York, October 20-25, 1902.
The session was successful in every respect; many foreign govern-
ments and institutions of learning in Europe and throughout the
American Continent were represented, and the communications pre-
sented covered the entire field of aboriginal American history, anthro-
pology, ethnology, archeology, and linguistics.

Congress of Orientalists.—Prof. Paul Haupt, LL. D., honorary cura-
tor of the division of historic archeology in the United States National
Museum, attended the Thirteenth International Congress of Orientalists
as delegate of the Smithsonian Institution. This congress, which was
held at Hamburg, Germany, from September 4 to September 10, 1902,

yas organized in eight sections: I, Indo-European Linguistics; IT’,
India; II”, Iran; II], Indo-China and Oceania; IV, Central Asia and
the Far East; V, Semitic; VI, Islam; VIL*, Egyptian; VII*, African;
VIII, Relations between Orient and Occident (including Byzantine
studies). At first it was proposed to have a special colonial section,
but this idea was afterwards abandoned owing to the fact that a special
colonial congress was held at Berlin in October, 1902. The Hamburg
congress, which was attended by more than 600 members from all
parts of the globe, resolved to depart from the practice of printing the
transactions in full and to publish only a volume of proceedings, includ-
ing abstracts of all the papers presented and the subsequest discus-
sions, to be issued within half a year after adjournment. This volume
has as yet not appeared. The next congress will be held at Algiers in
April, 1905.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

An important epoch in the history of the National Museum has
occurred during the past year, when, by act of March 3, 1903, Con-
gress provided for the erection of an additional building, to cost not to
exceed $3,500,000.

The present building was completed in 1881 and was erected pri-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. gy

marily to accommodate the mass of objects received by the Government
from the International Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, these objects
having been in storage for several years. The present building was
cheaply erected and was not expected to meet the requirements of a
great national museum, and Secretary Baird soon found it necessary to
present to Congress the question of constructing a more adequate one;
and already in 1888, in my early incumbency, this was represented
to the Regents. Although Congress at various times during the past
twenty years has had the matter under consideration, definite action
was not taken by both Senate and House. During the first session of
the last Congress, however, a small appropriation was made for prepa-
ration of plans for a new building, as I stated in my last report.
Preliminary plans were submitted to Congress at its last session and
authority has been granted to the Regents of the Institution to proceed
in the construction of an additional building, to contain about 10 acres
of floor space, or treble that we have at present, which will be worthy
to accommodate the great collections of the nation.

The law reads as follows:

‘* Building for National Museum: To enable the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution to commence the erection of a “suitable fireproof
building with granite fronts, for the use of the National Museum, to
be erected on the north side of the Mall, between Ninth and Tw elfth
streets northwest, substantially in accordance with Plan A, prepared
and submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution under the provisions of the act approved June twenty-eighth,
nineteen hundred and two, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Said building complete, including heating and ventilating apparatus and
elevators, shall cost not to exceed three million five hundred thousand
dollars, and a contract or contracts for its completion is hereby author-
ized to be entered into, subject to appropriations to be made by Congress.
The construction shall be in charge of Bernard R. Green, Super intend-
ent of Buildings and Grounds, Library of Congress, who shall make
the contracts herein authorized and disburse all appropriations made
for the work, and shall receive as full compensation for his services
hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annually in addition to his
present salary, to be paid out of said appropriations.”

The Regents, at their meeting of March 12, adopted the following
resolution:

‘* Resolved, That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the
Chancellor and the chairman of the executive committee, be author-
ized to represent the Board of Regents, so far as may be necess: ary, in
consultation with Bernard R. Green, to whom the ‘construction’ and
contracts for the new Museum building are committed by Congress in
the act making an appropriation for that purpose.”

_ The final plans for the new structure were commenced toward the
close of the fiscal year, and the construction will be pushed as rapidly
as is consistent with the magnitude of the work. It has been decided
to locate the building on the northern side of the Smithsonian Park,

facing the present Smithsonian and Museum buildings, though at a
distance of several hundred feet. It will be a firepr oar building with
rranite front and will have about 500 feet frontage and be about 330
feet deep, with four stories, including the basement. The main and
second floors will be used for exhibition halls, while the basement and
third floors will serve for laboratory and storage purposes.

I have great pleasure in recording this final result of the recommen-
dations of the Regents and their Secretary and of the good will of
Congress.

The year shows marked progress in nearly every branch of the
Museum. Two hundred and thirty-six thousand specimens were
received, making the present total over 5,650,000, and there were dis-
tributed to educational establishments about 33,000 objects. Letters
requesting information show an increase of about 25 per cent in num-
ber, and nearly 900 lots of specimens were received for identification.
The distribution of publications also shows an increase over previous
years, and to the library some valuable collections of books on spe-
cial zoological subjects have been added.

-Among the anthropological accessions during the year I may men-
tion some interesting specimens illustrating the native arts and
industries of Sumatra and the Straits Settlements, collected by Dr.
W. L. Abbott; a large ethnological collection from the Philippines,
furnishing information regarding the life and customs of the natives
of those islands; a number of bronzed wooden images representative
of Buddhist religious art, a series of models of United States war ves-
sels, and of land and naval ordnance; and some relics of General and
Mrs. Grant of much intrinsic and tiecerie interest, presented by their
children.

The biological and geological departments of the Museum. also
received valuable additions, which are enumerated in the report of the
Assistant Secretary, where will also be found details in regard to
explorations and researches conducted under direction of the Museum.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Researches among the American Indians have been meee by the
Bureau as outlined in the plan of operations submitted June 30, 1902,
and approved by me May 23, 1903.

The earlier part of the (fiscal) year was marked by the death of Maj.
John W. Powell, and in October Mr. W. H. Holmes was appointed
his successor.

Major Powell was born March 24, 1834, and died September 23,
1902. He organized the Bureau of Rehnolory and under the general
direction of the Institution carried on its researches until his death.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 185)

The story of his well-filled life has been told by others; he was too
near and too dear a friend for me, perhaps, to speak of it With a
wholly impartial judgment, but Iam glad to believe that I, too, had
acquired his friendship and that this mutual feeling colored all our
relations.

Major Powell, who had taken his part in the great events of our
civil war (where he served as captain of artillery under Grant at Vicks-
burg) and who had lost an arm in his country’s service, was first
known to me, as to many others, by one of the most remarkable feats
of exploration left for anyone to accomplish.

The old Spanish explorer, Coronado, who in 1540 penetrated to what
is now known as the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, came back with
the story of a crack in the earth at the bottom of which the great
tower of the cathedral of Seville would seem no bigger than a man.
This was set down as a traveler’s tale.

In this unexplored region the Colorado River, however, was found
to flow for nearly 1,000 miles through scenery unequaled on this
globe, for during a great part of its course it is bounded by walls over
a mile in altitude, at the bottom of which the unknown stream descends
with frequent falls through a channel from which there is no escape
except by climbing the nearly impassable precipices which shut it in.
The river is the only road, and its entire course abounds in hourly
perils. This was the scene of Major Powell’s exploration in 1867, which,
though conducted for purely scientific purposes, yet, considering all
that it involved, may be called one of heroic adventure, while the skill
which overcame every difficulty was not less conspicuous than the
courage of the leader, who, maimed as he was, fought with constant
physical perils, but came through safely together with those who had
trusted their lives to his guidance. None of his subsequent distin-
euished scientific life will ever efface the memory of this splendid
feat. It is one which surpasses in all its elements of interest and
danger, perhaps, the work of any such explorer of modern times.

I leave to more competent hands the description of the great and
notable work in geology and ethnology which occupied Major Powell’s
later life, and only add a few words on some qualities of the man
best known to an intimate friend.

I have been with Major Powell in the life of the city and in the
life of the wilderness, and wherever I have been with him I think I
have been more impressed with the simplicity and self-comprised
nature of his character than even with the complexity of his knowl-
edge and achievements. Besides his splendid capacity for leadership
in battle and adventure, besides his varied knowledge as a scientific
man, the mystery of this world, which pure science so little recog-
nizes, was always present to Major Powell’s mind; the lapse of ages,
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the wonderful birth of species, the path that threaded past time on
and up to man—all these things were present to his thought and
colored his work, were always associated with what he did as a man of
science, and constituted his innermost point of view.

He was a generous man, kind to others and helpful; a brave and
always a self-contained man who found in himself counsel sufficient
for his need. He was a stoic who suffered long years of pain in
silence, and who, at the end, met the approach of death as though it
were a familiar incident of life. We shall not often look upon his like.

In the past year’s work of the Bureau scientific researches among
Indian tribes in the field, in documentary investigations, and in labo-
ratory and general office routine have been pursued with the usual
effectiveness. Systematic field work has been successfully prosecuted
in many States and Territories and in San Domingo and Porto Rico.
Six members of the staff have spent periods of greater or less extent
in the field and have secured materials for embodiment in reports.
These researches have furnished data bearing more or less fully upon
numerous branches of the science of man, including tribal classifica-
tion and history, languages, religions, social systems, arts and indus-
tries, esthetics, and welfare.

A principal feature of the year’s work has been the taking up, with
renewed vigor, of the preparation of the dictionary of Indian tribes,
which had been on hand fora number of years. The plan contem-
plates the publication of two octavo volumes, which shall embody in
compact form the great body of information gathered during the past
years regarding the American race, its linguistic families, tribes, vil-
lages, individuals, and history, and make more evident the great utili-
ties of the Bureau’s work. The first volume was practically ready for
the press at the close of the year, but to my regret the resolution pro-
viding for the issue of the work in octavo form did not reach a vote
during the session of Congress, and the manuscript was not transmit-
ted to the printer.

The reading of proofs of reports in press, the preparation of illus-
trations for forthcoming volumes, and the photographing of visiting
Indians have gone on as usual.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service of the Institution is the medium
for exchange of publications between the principal governments and
scientific institutions and libraries of the world. Every year shows
an increase over the work accomplished during the previous year.
During the past year the total number of packages handled showed an
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9]

increase of 19 per cent over the year 1901-2, and the weight an increase
of 41 per cent. Seventy-five per cent of the weight represents pack-
ages sent abroad and 25 per cent the weight of packages received from
foreign countries.

The total number of correspondents or beneficiaries of the facilities
of the exchange service at home and abroad aggregates 44,012, of which
13,121 are foreign institutions, 21,332 foreign individuals, 3,319 domes-
tic institutions, and 6,240 domestic individuals.

In 1901 Congress increased from 50 to 62 the number of sets of
official documents of this country to be exchanged with foreign coun-
tries, and provided for a further increase to 100 sets when deemed
expedient in the judgment of the Librarian of Congress. Thus far,
however, the institution has been called on to transmit through its
exchange service only 12 parts of sets to foreign exchanges, thus
leaving 12 full sets actually provided for and 26 additional sets, or
such parts thereof as may be deemed necessary, still available for
exchange with other countries.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The collection of animals housed and cared for in the National
Zoological Park continues to increase in interest and value, and in
order to adequately provide for it new buildings for special groups of
animals need to be erected. During the past year an elephant house
has been built, which, owing to the limited appropriation, can only be
spoken of as a considerable improvement over the temporary quarters
previously occupied.

It is expected that the funds provided under the general appropria-
tion for the present year will permit the commencement of the con-
struction of a house for small mammals, which is the next most
important need.

As the number of buildings in the park increases it becomes neces-
sary to consider a method of heating them in an effective and econom-
ical manner. At present each separate building has its own heating
apparatus, each requiring the employment of a special set of men for
its care and management. It would conduce to economy both in fuel
and in service if all the buildings in the park lying within a reason-
able radius could be heated from a central heating plant, which could
be managed by a single set of men.

Considerable additions to the collection have been made during the
year through the public spirit of Dr. F. W. Goding, United States
consul at Newcastle, New South Wales, who has sent more than 140
specimens of the unusually interesting fauna of that region. This
shows in a remarkable manner what can be done by our officers abroad
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

who are fully awake to the needs of our national collection and
willing to devote some of their time to its enrichment.

I have repeatedly called attention to the wasteful destruction of
Alaskan fauna, and am gratified to say that the last Congress passed
an act for its protection, so that it may be reasonably expected that
the wholesale slaughter of these interesting animals may be checked.
A clause of the act permits the Smithsonian Institution to procure
specimens for its use.

The Zoological Park was declared by Congress to be for the advance-
ment of science and the instruction and recreation of the people. It
has hitherto more largely fulfilled the second object, but in pursuance
of the special scientific activities of the park I hope that there may be

established at an early date a pathological laboratory, where much may
be learned of the diseases of animals and their relations to those that
affect the human family. Such a useful laboratory can be erected at
a very moderate cost.

The growth of the city in the vicinity of the National Zoological
Park has finally caused a definitive establishment of streets. These do
not in all cases conform to the boundaries of the park, which therefore
abuts at several places upon the back yards of neighboring residences.
This will undoubtedly cause unsightly borders unless some means is
taken to prevent it. I have given a full discussion of this subject in
my report for the years ending June 80, 1895, and June 30, 1896.
The evil has increased rather than diminished, and [ would recom-
mend that action be taken by Congress to remedy this condition by
purchasing suflicient land to extend the park to the nearest neighbor-
ing street throughout its entire boundary.

THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Bolographic studies of the spectrum of the sun and the provision of
a large horizontal telescope to be used for studies of special portions
of the solar radiation have been the distinguishing features of the work
of the Astrophysical Observatory during the past year. Results of
uncommon interest have been reached in the bologr: ae work of the
past twelve months, and especially in the studies of the absorption of
the solar rays by our atmosphere, as appears in the detailed report of
the aid acting in charge, which may be found in the Appendix.

Briefly this has shown that the earth’s atmosphere, so far as it can
be observed here, has been more opaque than usual within the present
calendar year, so much so as to reduce the direct radiation of the sun
at the earth’s surface by about 10 per cent, on the average, through-
out the whole visible and infra-red spectrum, and by more than double
this amount in the blue and violet portions of the spectrum. This
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. De

alteration of the transparency of the air has not, however, been con-
fined to the region of Washington.

Another interesting observation is that determinations of the rate of
solar radiation outside the earth’s atmosphere might appear to indicate
that there has been adecrease of the solar radiation itself since March 26,
1903; but I refer to this with hesitation, as I have elsewhere observed
that it is scarcely possible to be certain of the accuracy of results of
this sort when based on observations near sea level. The value of a
solar observatory at a high altitude, to which I referred last year, can
hardly be overestimated.

A new determination of the temperature of the sun, based on the
distribution of the solar radiation in the spectrum, has yielded a result
of 5,920~ of the centigrade scale above absolute zero.

For the purpose of the special study of the nature of sun spots, the
absorption of the solar gaseous envelope, and for other observations
requiring a large solar image an equipment including a horizontal
reflecting telescope of 140-foot focus and 20-inch aperature and a
coelostat of improved construction to furnish at all times a 20-inch
horizontal northerly directed solar beam has been provided. The
form of coelostat employed seems so well suited to solar work that
this large instrument will be exhibited by the Observatory at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904. Provision has been made in
connection with the long-focus telescope to churn the air traversed by
the beam from the coelostat to the focal image after the manner
described in my last year’s report. It is hoped that this installation
will have yielded results of interest before another year.

On the whole the work of the Astrophysical Observatory during the
past year has been quite as productive of results of interest as during
any former year of its existence, especially in showing a notable varia-
tion of atmospheric transparency which is likely to have affected
climate and the growth of vegetation over a considerable part of the
earth’s surface, and in the studies of atmospheric absorption and those
relating to the solar constant, to which I have referred, there seems
renewed promise of progress toward the goal **foretelling by such
means those remoter changes of weather which affect harvests,” which is
one of the great aims had in view in the foundation of the Observatory.

Respectfully submitted.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

APPEND TO THE SECRETARY'S. REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Str: | have the honor to submit the following report on the condition and opera-
tions of the National Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903.

The most noteworthy occurrence of the year, and, in fact, for many years past,
was the action of Congress in providing for an additional building for the National
Museum, a building that will not only treble the existing amount of space, but also
present an imposing and dignified appearance, and be entirely worthy to house the
great collections of the nation. The public will be greatly benefited by this measure,
and the opportunity will be given to arrange in classified order the great mass of
valuable material which, for over two decades, has been accumulating in insecure
and inconvenient storage quarters.

Marked progress has been made in nearly every branch of the Museum. The
number of specimens received was 236,000, increasing the total now in the possession
of the Museum to over 5,650,000. The number sent out in exchange and as gifts to
educational! establishments was above 33,000. The demands for information by letter
were increased at least 25 per cent, and nearly 900 lots of specimens were received
for identification. The amount of fieldwork carried on by members of the Museum
staff, however, was greatly diminished through lack of means.

There was an increased number and a more extensive distribution of publications,
and the library received as gifts two valuable collections of books and_ pamphlets
on special zoological subjects. Preparations for the Louisiana Purchase Exhibition
to be held at St. Louis in 1904 were well under way before the year ended, and the
fact is now evident that the Museum will have in that connection one of the largest
and most interesting exhibits it has ever assembled for such a purpose.

Buildings.—The work upon the final plans for the additional building was com-
menced near the close of the year, but several months must elapse before the work-
ing drawings are sufficiently advanced to begin making contracts. The new
structure will stand upon the north side of the Mall between Ninth and Twelfth
streets, with its center at Tenth street. Its location is, therefore, directly in front
of the present buildings, but at a sufficient distance from them to prevent any clash-
ing between the different styles of architecture. The building will be classic in
character and constructed of granite. Its frontage will be about 500 feet, and its
depth about 330 feet. It will have four stories, including the basement, the main
and second stories to be devoted to the public collections, the others to the storage
of the reserve specimens and the various objects of the activities of the Museum.
The entire floor area will amount to nearly 10 acres. It is expected that about four
years will be required for the completion of the structure.

The repairs about the present Museum building were extensive, owing in large
part to the poor condition of the roof, which seems to develop new leaks during

25
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

every heavy rain. The rotunda and four main halls have been erftirely repainted,
and this work was being extended to the four courts at the close of the year. This
extensive renovation will place the exhibition halls in a more presentable condition
than at any previous time.

Many new cases, both for exhibition purposes and for storage, have been con-
structed, and much has been accomplished in the rebuilding and repair of old furni-
ture and fixtures.

Organization and staf?.—One new division (Physical Anthropology ) has been added
to the Department of Anthropology, and one new section (Lower Alge) to the
Department of Biology. The scientific organization of the Museum, therefore, now
comprises 9 divisions and 4 sections in the Department of Anthropology; 9 divisions
and 13 sections in the Department of Biology; and 8 divisions and 3 sections in the
Department of Geology. The scientific staff includes 8 head curators, 17 curators,
13 assistant curators, 15 custodians, 12 aids, + associates, and 2 collaborators, mak-
ing a total of 66 persons, of whom only about one-half are paid employees of the
Museum, the remainder serving in a volunteer or honorary capacity.

Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator of the Department of Anthropology, having been
appointed Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Prof. Otis T. Mason has been
designated to assume his museum duties as acting head curator.

Dr. A. Hrdlicka took charge of the newly organized Division of Physical Anthro-
‘ology on May 1], as assistant curator, and Dr. G. T. Moore, of the Department of
Agriculture, became custodian of the new Section of the Lower Algze on May 25.
The designation of Mr. W. T. Swingle has been changed to that of custodian of the
Section of Higher Algve.

On December 31 Mr. Charles T. Simpson resigned his position as principal aid in
the Division of Mollusks, being succeeded by Mr. Paul Bartsch, whose place was in
turn taken by Mr. W. B. Maishall, appointed aid on April 1. Mr. R. G. Paine was
made an aid in the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians on April 6.

Additions to the collections.—The number of accessions received during the year was
1,648, about 230 more than in 1902, comprising in all about 236,000 specimens. This
increases the total number of specimens in the national collections to aboye 5,650,000.
Only the more important additions can be mentioned here.

One of the most valuable acquisitions by the Department of Anthropology con-
sisted of material recently collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott in Sumatra and the Straits
Settlements, and illustrating the native arts and industries of a region but poorly
represented in American museums. The many objects, numbering over 1,500, secured
in the Philippine Islands by the late Col. F. F. Hilder, of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, for the Government exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition, have been
turned over to the Museum by the Government Board. This collection is of especial
interest in that it furnishes much authoritative information regarding the life and
customs of the natives of the largest of our new possessions. Dr. Frank Russell,
formerly of the Bureau of American Ethnology, secured important material from
the Pima Indians of southern Arizona, which, together with many ethnological
objects from other sources, have been transferred by the Bureau to the custody
of the Museum. Several collections made by Lieut. G. T. Emmons, of the United
States Navy, illustrating the arts of the Chilcat and other Alaskan tribes, have also
been acquired.

An extremely noteworthy collection deposited in the Museum by Mr. 8. 8. How-
land, ot Washington, D. ©., consists of objects representing Buddhist religious art,
such as bronze and wooden images of Buddha and Buddhist saints, shrines, temple
lamps, and sacred writings on palm leaves, and also of several Oriental manuscripts
in Hebrew, Arabic, and other languages. Twenty-eight Jewish ceremonial objects
from North Africa were obtained from Mr. Ephraim Deinard, of Kearney, N. J., one
of the most interesting pieces being an ark of carved wood, containing a parchment
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Dil

scrou of the Pentateuch. The Egyptian exploration fund has presented some
valuable Grzeco-Egyptian papyri.

Among the accessions to the Division of Prehistoric Archeology were a collection
of implements and other objects obtained by Mr. W. H. Holmes from near Kimms-
wick, Mo., with the assistance of Mr. Gerard Fowke, who also transmitted a number
of hammer-stones, flint nodules, and other o}yjects from ancient quarries near Carter,
Ky., and a series of implements and specimens of ore, which had been mined for use
as paint, from aboriginal hematite mines at Leshe, Mo., collected by Mr. Holmes.
About 300 specimens of stone implements, gathered by the late Mr. Frank Hamilton
Cushing, including spearheads, arrowpoints, harpoons, and tools of various kinds,
and a very important collection made by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in Porto Rico and
Santo Domingo were received from the Bureau of American Ethnology. The ma-
terial from Santo Domingo comprises many types new to the Museum, while that
from Porto Rico contains several stone rings or collars, sculptured pillow stones, the
remains of human skeletons, and various other objects.

A series of models of United States war vessels, including gunboats, monitors, pro-
tected cruisers, and rams, deposited in the Museum by the Navy Department, form
a very attractive exhibit, being of especial interest to the public. The War Depart-
ment has also deposited a large number of models of heavy seacoast cannon, mountain
howitzers, and other types of ordnance formerly used by the Army, and a series of
small arms.

Many relics of General and Mrs. U. 8. Grant, of great intrinsic as well as historic
value, have been presented to the Museum by their children, through Brig. Gen.
Frederick D. Grant, U.S. Army. They include clothing worn by General Grant
during the civil war, commissions to different ranks in the Army, a cabinet presented
to Mrs. Grant by the Empress of Japan, said to be 1,000 years old and valued at
$20,000, several Japanese vases presented by the Emperor of Japan, and numerous
other objects. Eight hundred and thirty-seven gold, silver, and copper coins were
donated to the Museum by Mr. E. M. Chapman, of New York City.

Casts of the Neanderthal and Prague ancient crania were purchased for the newly
established division of Physical Anthropology, which has also secured five valuable
head-hunter’s skulls from New Guinea, and a large series of crania and parts of human
skeletons from the Army Medical Museum, the United States Fish Commission, and
other sources.

The zoological specimens contributed by Dr. W. L. Abbott consisted of a large
number of deer, squirrels, porcupines, and a new ape, collected in Sumatra and on
the adjacent islands, and on the Riou Peninsula south of Singapore. Many of the
species are new to science. The donations made by Doctor Abbott as the result of
his recent extensive explorations in the East Indies now comprise about 2,500 mam-
mals and nearly 4,000 birds, besides several thousand specimens in other branches
of natural history.

Large collections of bird skins, fishes, corals, mollusks, crustaceans, and other
marine invertebrates, obtained during the expedition of the United States Fish Com-
mission steamer Albatross to the Hawaiian Islands and to Samoa, have been trans-
mitted to the Museum and will be referred to more in detail in the next report.
They include interesting series of the birds of the Laysan Islands.

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, presented a quantity of mammals from the Yellow-
stone National Park and from Fort Snelling, Minn., and the Hon. B. 8. Rairden,
United States consul at Batavia, two undescribed species ot Tragulus from Java. A
valuable skeleton of the porpoise, Pseudorca crassidens, trom the Hawaiian Islands,
the first reported from that region, was contributed by Prof. C. H. Gilbert, of the
Leland Stantord Junior University.

Several rare birds of paradise and other valuable specimens, including a pair of
flightless cormorants, from the Galapagos Islands, were received from Mr. A. Boucard,
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Isle of Wight, England, and a Javan jungle fowl, a black-winged peacock, and other
birds from Mr. Homer Davenport, Morris Plains, N. J. The Bishop Museum, of
Honolulu, presented about 40 bird skins, including several species not previously
represented in the Museum collection, and about 300 interesting specimens from
Chiriqui, Costa Rica, including a number of cotypes. Fifty-two bird skins from Hon-
duras were obtained from Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, partly as a gift and partly
in exchange. The most important accession to the dological collection was a fossil
egg of Aepyornis maximus from Madagascar. Valuable birds’ eggs from Australia,
South America, and other countries were also received from different sources.

Reptiles from southern Florida were contributed by Mr. E. J. Brown, of Lemon
City, and a fine series of salamanders was presented by Messrs. Brimley and Sherman,
of Raleigh, N.C. From Prof. P. Biolley, of the National Museum of San Jose, Costa
Rica, there were obtained several very interesting specimens, including a new gecko,
described by Doctor Stejneger as Spherodactylus pacificus. Kighteen snakes from the
Island of Cyprus were purchased from Giacomo Cecconi, of Florence, Italy.

The accessions to the collection of fishes were numerous and important. Dr. O. P.
Jenkins, of Leland Stanford Junior University, donated 42 types of Hawaiian fishes,
constituting a second installment of a series of types the first of which were trans-
mitted in 1901. A yaluable collection of types and cotypes of Japanese fishes was
received from Dr. David S. Jordan, president of the same university. <A large sal-
mon, weighing about 50 pounds, taken at Cascapedia, Canada, was presented by Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia. A deep-sea pelican fish, captured at a depth of
between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms, during the survey for the Pacific cable, was trans-
mitted by the officers of the U.S. 8. Nero, and a large conger eel was received from
Mr. Louis Mowbray, of Bermuda, through the New York Aquarium.

Besides the mollusks obtained by the Fish Commission expedition to the Hawaiian
Islands a number of well-preserved land shells from the same region were donated
by Mr. W. H. Henshaw, of Hilo, Hawaii. Interesting collections of shells were also
received from Dr. Henry Loomis, Yokohama, Japan; Mr. F. A. Woodworth, San
Francisco, Cal.; Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd, Burnett, Cal., and the Imperial Academy of
Sciences, St. Petersburg. A specimen of the rare Voluta mamilla Sby., from Tasma-
nia, and other valuable Australian shells, were also added to the mollusk collection.

Among the most important additions to the entomological division were a collec-
tion of over 19,000 specimens of gall wasps, parasites, etc., from Canada, transmitted
by the Department of Agriculture; a series of Costa Rican insects of different orders
purchased from Mr. P. Schild, of New York City; 2,000 specimens of Chilean insects
from Mr. E. C. Reed, Concepcion, Chile; 277 specimens of African Lepidoptera
received in exchange from Dr. Yngve Sjostedt, Stockholm, Sweden; a collection of
mites, including types and cotypes, from Prof. Robert Wolcott, of the University of
Nebraska; specimens of many orders and comprising types and cotypes, from Prof.
T. D. A. Cockerell, East Las Vegas, N. Mex.; about 700 specimens of European Cole-
optera from Dr. W. H. Valway, Cleveland, Ohio, and a valuable series of Venezuelan
Cicindellide and Scarabeidex from Mr. E. A. Klages, of Crafton, Pa. A collection of
African butterflies, including examples of several species described by Doctor Auri-
villius, was received in exchange from the Royal Natural History Museum, Stock-
holm. An important exchange was made with the American Entomological Society,
whereby the Museum received 100 species of Mexican and Central American Hyme-
noptera, including many cotypes. Thirty-four cotypes of Coleoptera were presented
by Prof. H. C. Fall, of Pasadena, Cal.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates obtained through exchange with the Museum
of Natural History, Paris, France, about 50 species of fresh-water crustaceans. A
series of Japanese crustaceans, including many interesting specimens collected by Dr.
David 8. Jordan and Mr. J. O. Snyder, was presented by the Leland Stanford Junior
University. A number of crustaceans from the Maldive Islands, collected by Mr.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7S

Alexander Agassiz in 1901 and 1902, was received from the Museum of Comparative
Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., and similar material from Costa Rica and Cocos Island
was acquired through exchange with the National Museum of Costa Rica. Among
other accessions of special interest may be mentioned four lots of isopod crustaceans,
including types obtained by the Harriman expedition, received from Prof. Trevor
Kincaid, Seattle, Wash.; 23 specimens of echinoderms and crustaceans from Great
Britain and from various localites in the East, contributed by Mr. H. M. Parritt, of
London, England; a quantity of foraminifera from Great Britain and the Seychelles
Islands, presented by Mr. H. Sidebottom, Cheshire, England, and a collection of
parasites of fishes, transmitted by Prof. Edwin Linton, of Washington, Pa. A very
interesting series of European parasites, comprising trematodes, cestodes, and nema-
todes, was deposited in the Museum by the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department
of Agriculture.

To the Osteological collection were added a skeleton of the giant salamander, Sie-
boldia japonica, presented by the Imperial Museum of Tokyo; three skeletons of
Harris’s cormorant, Nanopterum harrissi, purchased from Mr. R. H. Beck, of Berryessa,
Cal., and a skeleton of musk ox from Ellesmere Land, representing a species new to
the Museum, from Mr. J. 8. Warmbath, of Washington, D. C.

The National Herbarium has been enriched by a collection of about 1,400 plants
from the Philippine Archipelago, contributed by the Philippine bureau of agricul-
ture, and by another collection from the same locality received from the Royal
Botanical Gardens, Kew, England. Mr. William R. Maxon, of the Museum staff,
obtained a large collection of ferns and other plants during a collecting trip of about
two months’ duration in Jamaica. Dr. EK. A. Mearns, U. 8S. Army, presented a large
series of plants collected in the Yellowstone National Park, and Capt. John Donnell
Smith, of Baltimore, Md., who has made extensive contributions to the Herbarium,
continued his donations during the past year, transmitting a series of plants from the
West Indies and Central America.

As in past years, the principal accessions to the geological collections were from
the United States Geological Survey. Among the more important ones of the year
were two series of minerals, rocks, and ores, constituting a portion of the exhibit
made by the Survey at the expositions recently held in Buffaloand Charleston. An
interesting lot of tourmalinitic quartz from Little Pipestone district, Montana, of
which some of the specimens are covered on one side with parallel layers of ame-
thysts of different hues, accompanied this material.

A valuable series of massive and cut polished stalactites and stalagmites from the
Copper Queen mine was presented by Mr. James Douglas, of Bisbee, Ariz.

A specimen of pallasite, weighing 351 pounds, from Mount Vernon, Ky.; a mass of
meteoric iron from Arispe, Mexico, weighing 116 pounds; a mass of meteoric iron from
Persimmon Creek, in North Carolina, weighing 9 pounds, and a meteoric stone, weigh-
ing nearly 9 pounds, from Hendersonville, N. C., are among the most important
additions to the meteoric collections.

A small piece of the only known specimen of footeite was donated by Mr. Warren
M. Foote, of Philadelphia, and 35 very desirable minerals not previously represented
in the Museum collection were obtained by purchase.

The largest and most valuable addition to the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology
was the second installment of the E. O. Ulrich collection of Paleozoic bryozoans,
comprising about 7,500 specimens and 2,500 microscopic slides. The collection as a
whole is the most extensive of its kind in existence and contains many unique speci-
mens. About 14,000 corals, crinoids, mollusks and other invertebrate fossils were
received from Prof. Carl Rominger, of Ann Arbor, Mich. Many of these have been
figured and described in the reports of the geological survey of Michigan. The
Andrew Sherwood collection of Pennsylvania Upper Devonic vertebrate and inver-
tebrate fossils is also entitled to special notice. This collection was brought together
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

by Mr. Sherwood, and includes many choice slabs filled with large brachiopods and
mollusks, besides about 3,000 small specimens.

The collection of vertebrate fossils was increased by several important aaditions,
one of which, comprising the teeth of Mastodon humboldtii and Mastodon cordillerum
and casts of mandibular rami, was received from the British Museum, London, Eng-
land. Dr. H. J. Herbein, of Pottsville, Pa., contributed a slab of sandstone showing
reptilian footprints, from Mount Carbon, Pa., and Mr. Whitman Cross, of the United
States Geological Survey, collected and transmitted a tooth of Cladodus formosus
(Hay) from Needle Mountains Quadrangle, Colorado.

About 500 specimens of Triassic plants, collected in Connecticut and Massachusetts
by Mr. 8. Ward Loper, of the United States Geological Survey, have been turned
over to the Museum; a small series of fossil plants from the Permian of Ohio was
donated by Mr. H. Herzer, of Marietta, Ohio, and about 80 specimens of Paleozoic
plants were received with the Ulrich collection above mentioned.

Exvplorations.—Fewer explorations than usual were carried on last year directly by
the Museum, owing to the scarcity of means for this purpose.

The fieldwork under the Bureau of American Ethnology, which yielded interest-
ing collections of objects, since deposited in the Museum as before mentioned, was
conducted by Mr. William H. Holmes, Mr. Gerard Fowke, and Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes. Mr. Holmes visited the aboriginal hematite mines at Lesle, Mo., and Mr.
Fowke an ancient quarry in Carter County, Ky., while Doctor Fewkes spent con-
siderable time in Santo Domingo and Porto Rico.

The important explorations of Dr. William L. Abbott in Sumatra and the adjoin-
ing islands, as well as on the mainland of the Straits Settlements, have already
been referred to under the heading of Additions to the Collections. These explora-
t.ons, which are carried on entirely at the expense of Doctor Abbott, have now been
in progress for several years, and through his generosity the National Museum has
been the fortunate recipient of the very large and extremely valuable collections that
he has made.

Mr. F. A. Lucas, with two others of the Museum staff, visited one of the stations
of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, on the coast of Newfoundland, in the
interest of the St. Louis Exposition, for the purpose of securing as complete a
representation as possible of a large sulphur-bottom whale. He was entirely suc-
cessful, returning with a perfect skeleton of a specimen measuring about 78 feet
long, and with molds of the exterior from which a cast of the entire animal will be
made. These specimens, at the close of the exposition, will be returned and
exhibited in the Museum.

Through the courtesy of the Geographical Society of Baltimore the Museum was
enabled to send Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley with an expedition to the
Bahama Islands, where they made collections of the fishes and land animals of
that region.

Dr. H. G. Dyar and Mr. Rolla P. Currie, also of the Museum staff, accompanied
an expedition to British Columbia under the auspices of the Carnegie Museum, and
brought back with them a large and important collection of insects. Mr. Gerrit 8.
Miller, jr., collected mammals in Virginia, and Mr. William R. Maxon plants in
Jamaica.

Mr. 8. Ward Loper, of the United States Geological Survey, made for the Museum
an interesting collection of Triassic plants in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and,
through arrangements with the Director of the Survey, Hon. Charles D. Walcott,
Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the Museum staff, spent several weeks in Virginia and
Georgia with the special view of determining the geological horizons of the southern
part of the Appalachians. Incidental to this study he collected many fossils. Sev-
eral Weeks were spent by Mr. R. 8. Bassler in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, collect-
ing invertebrate fossils.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

In connection with the Baldwin-Ziegler expedition to the Polar regions, a small
collection of natural-history specimens obtained about Franz Josef Land was pre-
sented to the Museum by Mr. Ziegler. It is hoped that the second expedition now
in progress under the same auspices will result in additional accessions from that
little-known region.

Researches.—The Museum collections serve as the basis for a large amount of
scientific work, as detailed each year in the full reports of the Museum, which also
contain lists of the papers resulting from these studies. These investigations are car-
ried on both in Washington and at different establishments throughout the country.
The Museum assistants give to the classification of the collections as much time as
can be spared from their duties as custodians. Specialists from the scientific bureaus
in Washington and from elsewhere are frequent visitors at the Museum, coming for
the purpose of consulting the collections or of conducting researches of greater or
less extent. The number of specimens sent out to investigators during the year has
amounted to more than 12,000.

Among those now engaged in the study of special groups in the direct interest of the
Museum are Prof. Charles L. Edwards, of Trinity College, Hartford, who is at work
upon the pedate holothurians; Prof. Hubert Lyman Clark, of Olivet College, Michi-
gan, who has the apodal holothurians; Prof. C. C. Nutting, of the Uniyersity of Lowa,
who has nearly completed a monograph ‘on the Sertularian hydroids; Dr. Charles
B. Wilson, of the State Normal School, Westfield, Mass., who is studying the para-
sitic copepoda, and one of whose papers on the family Argulidze was published
during the year; and Prof. A. G. Mayer, scientific director of the museum of the
Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, who is finishing the uncompleted studies of
the late Prof. Alpheus Hyatt on the Museum collection of Achatinellidee.

Among other well-known specialists to whom zoological material has been lent are
Dr. J. A. Allen and Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural
History, New York City; Mr. Witmer Stone and Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of the Philadel-
phia Academy of Natural Sciences, and Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian
Museum.

About 400 orchids were sent to Mr. Oakes Ames, of North Easton, Mass., and
about 300 specimens of Rudbeckia and the same number of Coreopsis to Mr. C. D.
Beadle, of Biltmore, N. C.

The Department of Geology has contributed material to the United States Geolog-
ical Survey and to various Bureaus of the Department of Agriculture for use in con-
nection with current investigations; specimens of radio-active minerals have been
furnished to Prof. George F. Barker, of the University of Pennsylvania; about 260
Tertiary insects were lent to Prof. 8. W. Williston, of the University of Chicago, and
500 Carboniferous insects to Dr. Anton Handlirsch, of the Royal Austrian Museum,
Vienna.

Exchanges.—In the act of 1846 founding the Smithsonian Institution, the exchange
of duplicate specimens with other institutions was authorized as a means of enlarging
the collections in the Smithsonian Museum. This practice was begun at an early
date, and has been continued down to the present time. It has not, however, been
carried on to the extent that the collections would permit, for the reason that the
staff has never been large enough to classify the specimens to such a degree that
even a fair part of the duplicates could be set aside from those which must remain
as permanent records in the Museum. Nevertheless, very much has been done in
this way and numerous exchanges were made during the past year. Furthermore,
in accordance with acts of Congress, duplicate specimens not required for exchange,
have been made up into sets and distributed to educational establishments throughout
the country, thus promoting educational interests at a distance from the Museum.

The exhibition halls.—A number of collections and specimens recently received
haye been placed on exhibition, but, as intimated in previous reports, the installa-
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tion of new material is made possible only by transferring other collections to
storage or by crowding the exhibits so closely together as to render them practically
useless to the public.

The gallery of the northwest court has afforded temporary accommodations for the
ethnological material obtained from the Philippine Islands, while the other galleries
assigned to the Department of Anthropology have been utilized in relieving the
general congestion which of late years has become so noticeable throughout the
Museum building. The large ethnological collections received from Dr. William L.
Abbott and from the Museum-Gates expedition, with many others of equal impor-
tance, have been stored away for the present. Special attention has been paid to the
labeling of the historical collections, and conspicuous labels now indicate the con-
tents of the various halls, alcoves, and cases. The study collection of Eskimo
objects has been rearranged and placed temporarily in storage cases in the north-
west range. As it has been impossible to make the repairs called for in the hall
devoted to Prehistoric Archeology, it has remained closed-during nearly the entire
year.

In the Department of Biology good results have been obtained by the rearrange-
ment and refitting of cases, especially those containing the exhibits of mammals,
insects, fishes, and marine invertebrates, and much progress has been made in label-
ing both the small American mammals and the Old World series. A new mounting
has been made of the very beautiful Argus pheasants, which were presented by Dr.
William L. Abbott some years ago, and it is now one of the most attractive of all
the exhibition groups.

The geological halls remain much the same as last year because no additional
space has become available, but there has been some expansion in the exhibit of
fossil vertebrates, to which a specimen of Claosaurus will shortly be added, as well
as the mounted skeleton of a mastodon. The cases containing the nonmetallic min-
erals and the geographic exhibit of economic minerals haye been carefully cleaned
and the specimens rearranged, while the case in the west-south range, in which the
stratigraphic and historical collections are exhibited, has been reconstructed and the
specimens have been reinstalled. A large number of labels and reference cards have
been prepared, and some progress has been made in the preparation of the card cat-
alogue of type material.

Visitors.—The total number of visitors to the Museum building was 315,307, and
to the Smithsonian building 181,174, an increase in the first instance of about 81 per
cent and in the latter of about 26 per cent over the previous year.

Meetings and lectures.—The use of the lecture hall was granted to the Biological
Society of Washington for a series of five scientific lectures given between February
14 and March 14. The Nayal Medical School and the Army Medical School also
held their graduating exercises there on April 4 and 14, respectively, and the annual
spring meeting of the National Academy of Sciences was held in the same place from
April 21 to 23.

Publications.—Somewhat more than the usual number of publications were issued
during the past year, and it is estimated that the distribution to libraries and indi-
viduals, both at home and abroad, amounted to about 45,000 volumes and separate
papers.

The new publications of the year consisted of the Annual Report for 1900; the
second volume of Mr. Ridgway’s monograph on The Birds of North and Middle
America; A List of North American Lepidoptera, by Dr. Harrison G. Dyar; volume
24 of the Proceedings, in bound form; the separate papers, 31 in number, consti-
tuting volume 25, and the first 27 papers of volume 26 of the Proceedings. A
pamphlet of instructions to collectors of anthropological objects, with special refer-
ence to the Philippine Islands and other insular possessions, prepared by Mr. Wil-
liam H. Holmes and Prof. O. T. Mason, was issued as Part Q of Bulletin 39.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

The sundry civil act for 1903 provided for the transfer of the management of the
Contributions from the United States National Herbarium from the Department of
Agriculture to the National Museum. Under this provision two former volumes,
Numbers II and VII, were reprinted by the Museum, namely, Botany of Western
Texas, by Prof. J. M. Coulter, and Systematic and Geographic Botany and Aborigi-
nal Uses of Plants, by Messrs. Coulter, Rose, Cook, and Chesnut. Of the current
volume, Number VIII, parts 1, 2, and 3, were issued, their titles being as follows:
Studies of Mexican and Central American Plants, by Dr. J. N. Rose; Economic
Plants of Porto Rico, by Prof. O. F. Cook and Mr. G. N. Collins; and A Study of
Certain Mexican and Guatemalan Species of Polypodium, by Mr. William R. Maxon.

A number of Museum papers greatly in demand, the editions of which had become
exhausted, were reprinted. Among them were the first volume of Bulletin 47, by
DoctorsJordan and Evermann, entitled ‘‘ Fishes of North and Middle America;’’? Doc-
tor Stejneger’s paper on the Poisonous Snakes of North America; Doctor Dall’s Pre-
liminary Catalogue of the Shell-bearing Marine Mollusks and Brachiopods of the
Southeastern Coast of the United States; Mr. Ridgway’s monograph on the Humming
Birds, and several of the pamphlets of instructions to collectors from Bulletin No. 39.

Twelve papers prepared by members of the staff, based upon material in the
Museum, were by permission of the Secretary, printed in publications other than
those of the National Museum.

Library.—The increase of the Museum library during the past year has been
mainly due to two very important gifts—the Hubbard and Schwarz, and the Dall
donations. The former collection, consisting of 300 books and 1,500 pamphlets, was
brought together by Mr. G. G. Hubbard and Mr. E. A. Schwarz (custodian of
Coleoptera in the Museum) while carrying on their studies more or less conjointly,
and forms an accessory to their large collection of insects presented to the Museum
several years ago. It is an entomological library, with special reference to the
American Coleoptera. The contribution by Mr. William H. Dall, honorary curator
of Mollusks, comprises about 1,600 bound volumes and about 2,000 pamphlets on the
molluska, a special library of great value, which has been accumulated during many
years of research. It is accompanied by a card catalogue covering the literature of
Conchology, both recent and fossil, up to about 1860.

The aggregate of additions to the library for the year amounted to 3,161 books,
3,260 pamphlets, and 303 parts of volumes.

Expositions.—Much progress has been made during the year in connection with
the preparation of the exhibits for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. An especially
noteworthy feature will consist of the complete skeleton and a cast of the exterior of
a sulphur-bottom whale which measured 78 feet long when caught. It was obtained
at one of the whaling stations on the Newfoundland coast and was roughly prepared
for shipment to this country by members of the Museum staff.

There will be several striking groups in ethnology, arranged by Mr. William H.
Holmes, who is also preparing a model of one of the great Maya temples in southern
Mexico. <A special effort is being made by Dr. F. W. True, the representative of the
Institution and the Museum, to produce a satisfactory display of American animals
mounted in accordance with the latest methods of taxidermy. The geological
exhibit, which is to include one or more of the huge fossil Dinosaurs, is being
prepared under the direction of Dr. George P. Merrill.

REPORT OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the operations cf the
Bureau of American Ethnology for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress making provision for continuing researches
relating to the American Indians under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.
The work has been carried out, in the main, in accordance with the plan of opera-
tions submitted by Director Powell on May 20, 1902, and approved by the Secretary
May 23, 1902.

The death of Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau, occurred at Haven, Me.,
September 23, 1902. This event profoundly affects the interests of the Bureau, and
closes an epoch of exceptional importance in the history of the science of man. The
wisdom of the foundation laid by Director Powell is everywhere recognized, and the
impetus given to anthropological studies by his work must continue to be felt long
after the present initial stage of the science has ripened into the full knowledge which
shall regulate and direct the future development of the human race.

During the somewhat prolonged period of Director Powell’s illness the adminis-
trative work of the Bureau devolved upon Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge,
who was Acting Director at the time of Major Powell’s death. On October 11, 1902,
Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator in the Department of Anthropology, United States
National Museum, was appointed Chief of the Bureau and assumed charge of the
office October 13.

The research work of the Bureau has been carried on by a permanent force of 9
scientific employees, while a number of temporary assistants have been engaged for
brief periods in the office and among the western tribes. During the year 5 members
of the staff have spent a portion of their time in the field. The regions visited include
Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Towa, Okla-
homa, Indian Territory, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Idaho, California, Porto
Rico, and Santo Domingo.

The researches have been of exceptional importance and have dealt with numerous
branches of primitive culture and history, practical questions having been kept as
much as possible in view. The completion of reports on field exploration and the
preparation of papers dealing with special problems have claimed much attention, and
every effort has been made to bring up to date and submit for publication researches
that have been maturing during the previous years. The preparation of data for a
dictionary of the Indian tribes has been a principal feature of the year’s work, claim-
ing the attention of all available members of the Bureau staff and employing the
services of a number of special students. Detailed reference to this work is made
farther on in this report.

The range of the scientific work has been wide but has not extended, save inci-
dentally, to all departments of Anthropology. Philology, sociology, sophiology,
technology, and wsthetics have received attention by those conducting investiga-
tions among the tribes in the field and by those engaged in office researches, but
somatology and psychology have received no systematic attention.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

The nonscientitic work of the Bureau, which includes the library, the photo-
graphic laboratory, the editorial, and the general clerical work has engaged ten
persons aside from the chief administrative officer, and on the whole has progressed
favorably, many changes having been made in method and routine, especially
toward the close of the fiscal year.

For the better understanding of the work of the year and the conditions affecting
the present affairs of the Bureau, considerable data dealing with history, statistics,
and routine have been introduced into this report.

RESEARCH WORK.

The Chief prosecuted archeeological researches at a number of points in the eastern
section of the United States. Previous to October 13 he was engaged, with the
assistance of Mr. Gerard Fowke, in making examinations of the fossil bone beds at
Kimmswick, Mo., with the view of determining whether there was satisfactory
evidence that man was contemporaneous with the mammoth and the mastodon in
that region; but no traces of man were found in direct association with the fossil
remains. Examinations of aboriginal flint quarries and sites of stone-implement
manufacture were made in southern Indiana and in eastern Kentucky. In October

~ explorations were undertaken at Lansing, Kans., with the view of determining the
age of the human remains found embedded in loess-like formations near that place.
The formations were extensively trenched by Mr. Fowke, under the direction of the
Chief of the Bureau, and the conclusion was reached that the remains were of
exceptional antiquity for America, but that they could not with certainty be assigned
to a definite geological horizon and that they were probably of post-Glacial time.
In April the Chief paid a visit to Leslie, Mo., for the purpose of studying certain traces
of ancient operations reported to occur in an iron mine near that place. Very inter-
esting phenomena were encountered, the ancient aborigines having penetrated the
ore body in many directions and to surprising depths, the purpose being, apparently,
to obtain the red and yellow iron oxides fér paint. Many hundreds of mining tools
of stone were found in the ancient tunnels. Early in May a trip was made to Georgia
and Alabama for the purpose of examining quarry sites and caverns occupied in
ancient times by the aborigines.

Reports have been prepared on the explorations at Lansing, Kans., and at Leslie,
Mo. The first of these researches deals with the important and ever-recurring ques-
tion of the antiquity of man in America. It has been the aim of the Bureau, and espe-
cially of the present Chief, to occupy conservative ground with respect to this subject,
and to so scrutinize the discoveries and reputed discoveries reported from time to
time that erroneous interpretations should not prevail. The purpose of the excaya-
tions made at Lansing was to expose the formations containing the human remains
so fully that geologists of all ways of thinking might study them to advantage, thus
preventing the adoption of conclusions based on inadequate observations. The
Leslie iron mine study has an interesting bearing on the technic and industrial his-
tory of the tribes. It has been a matter of much surprise, as the investigations of
the ancient mining and quarrying have progressed, that the aborigines, seemingly
so nonprogressive and shiftless, should have conceived and carried out really great
enterprises. The technical knowledge and skill displayed are of a low order indeed,
but the work accomplished indicates remarkable enterprise and persistence, and
demonstrates the existence of native capacity of high order.

Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge, continued as Acting Director until October
13. During this period he prepared the annual report for the preceding year, made
a hasty archeological and ethnological reconnoissance in Minnesota, and in Septem-
ber visited Baddeck, Nova Scotia, whence he was called to the deathbed of Major
Powell in Haven, Me. In December he visited Mexico with the view of arranging
for an expeditien to the island of Tiburon, but in this he was-not successful. En route
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

he stopped over a day in New Mexico to visit some ancient ruins near the village of
Cuchilla. On returning from Mexico Mr. McGee suffered from a fever which pre-
vented active work for a period of about three months.

In July, August, and September, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was occupied in the prepa-
ration of the text and illustrations of an account of a reconnoissance made in Porto
Rico during May and June of the previous fiscal year. This report, which was
intended to bea résumé of what is known of the prehistoric inhabitants of Porto
Rico, was finished in October and placed in the hands of the Acting Director, who
transmitted it to the Public Printer as Bulletin 28. Considerable time in these
months was likewise given by Doctor Fewkes to correcting proofs and arranging the
plates of his memoir on a series of native pictures of Hopi katcinas, or ancestor-gods,
for the Twenty-first Annual Report of the Bureau. Doctor Fewkes left Washington
for a second expedition to the West Indies in the middle of November, remaining
there over five months and visiting the islands of Porto Rico and Santo Domingo,
The collection of prehistoric objects made on this trip numbers over 1,000 specimens,
110 of which were obtained by purchase in Santo Domingo, the remainder by explo-
ration and purchase in Porto Rico. Not only is this collection numerically the
largest which has been brought to the Smithsonian Institution from Porto Rico and
Santo Domingo at any one time, but it is also one of the most significant on account
of its wealth in typical forms previously unrepresented in the Museum.

Doctor Fewkes was able to determine by excavations that the inclosures surrounded
by aligned stones and called by the natives “juegos de bola’? were made by the
aborigines of the island for ceremonial dance places, and that neighboring mounds
are prehistoric cemeteries. The determination of the burial places of the prehistoric
Porto Ricans and their discovery in numbers are believed to be the most important
results of Doctor Fewkes’s field work in Porto Rico. With this information to guide
him, the archeologist will have little difficulty in the future in adding to existing
collections of prehistoric objects from Porto Rico and in placing them in their
proper categories.

Doctor Fewkes maae excavations in a cave called ‘‘ Cueva de las Golondrinas,’’ situ-
ated near the town of Manati, and found large quantities of Indian pottery and a few
other objects of aboriginal manufacture. All the evidence collected indicates that
while the aborigines had frequented this cave fora long time, the culture of the
earlier and later occupants was practically identical. After his return to Washington
in May, Doctor Fewkes was occupied in cataloguing the objects collected during the
winter and in preparing a preliminary report on them. He was permitted to with-
draw the account of his previous year’s explorations, which had been transmitted
tothe Public Printer as a bulletin with a view of incorporating with it the new mate-
rial obtained on this second visit to the island. The valuable results of the two
years’ work will thus appear in monographic form in a forthcoming annual report.

The researches of Doctor Fewkes furnish much material of value bearing upon ques-
tions of science and history. Of first importance is the decided advance made toward
identifying and rehabilitating the unfortunate peoples of the West Indies, swept
almost without record from the islands during the early years of Spanish coloniza-
tion. Considerable information regarding their physical characters and manner
of life has been gained, and various branches of culture are illustrated by the col-
lections, while definite notions of the origin, burial customs, and arts and industries
of the island peoples are for the first time conveyed to the world of science. Doctor
Fewkes has thus shed light on a significant and important chapter of aboriginal
American history.

The months of July to November, inclusive, were spent by Mrs. M. C. Stevenson
in researches among the Zuni Indians, the special objects being a comparative study
of the peoples of the Southwest and a collection of the ethnoflora of Zuhi. Some
years ago Mrs, Stevenson observed that the prayers of one of the Zuni rain priests
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ot

were sung in the Sia tongue, and that one of the esoteric fraternities sang in Piman,
but it was not until her last visit to Zufi that she learned that all of the thirteen eso-
teric fraternities used other languages than their own in their ceremonies. It is diffi-
cult to catch the words of an aboriginal choir singing to the accompaniment of rattles
and drums, especially when the mind is absorbed in noting the ritual rather than the
words employed. But during the last season, haying in view a comparative study of
the Pueblo Indians, and knowing thatat least one fraternity employed a foreign tongue,
Mrs. Stevenson closely observed this feature of the ceremonies and made special
inquiries of the priests and theurgists, thus determining the remarkable fact that this
was true of all. Several reasons could be advanced for this use of strange languages,
but it remains for future investigation to acquaint us fully with the facts.

Mrs. Stevenson makes the important observation that, although the ceremonies
which she describes in her monograph were regularly practiced during the first
decade and a half spent by her in their study and were faithfully observed in eyery
detail, they have since been gradually changed and in some instances have been
abandoned. It would thus appear that these researches were not undertaken a
moment too soon.

In the main the results of the year’s work in Zufi have been incorporated in the
monographic studies of the Zuni people prepared by Mrs. Stevenson during the pre-
vious years. The final work is now in the editor’s hands and will soon be submitted
for publication. Mrs. Stevenson’s familiarity with the language of the Zufis, the con-
fidence with which she has inspired them, the deep insight she has obtained into
the philosophical and religious meaning of their ceremonies, and her intimate knowl-
edge of their sociology peculiarly fit her for the presentation of a monograph on this
people.

The herbarium of edible, medicinal, and fetishistic plants collected by Mrs. Steven-
son over an area 110 miles north and south and 60 miles east and west from Zufi,
contains about 200 specimens. Among the many interesting varieties are a narcotic,
Datura stramonium, a specific for hemorrhage, Ustilago, and what the Zufi claim to be
their native cotton, Esculapia Mexicana. The fiber of the latter is made at the pres-
ent time into acord for the more sacred objects used by the rain priests, and the
Zunis claim that all of their cotton fabrics were woven of this plant before the advent
of the Spaniards. Acknowledgments are due to Dr. F. V. Coville, Botanist, Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and Dr. J. N. Rose, Assistant Curator, U. S. National Museum,
for their courteous assistance in providing Mrs. Stevenson with facilities for presery-
ing the plants and also for the classification of the collection.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. James Mooney was in the field in western
Oklahoma, engaged in the prosecution of researches among the Kiowa and Cheyenne
tribes in the joint interest of the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Field Colum-
bian Museum under an agreement made in the preceding year. Except during two
brief visits to Washington, in September and in November, 1902, Mr. Mooney
devoted the entire year to researches relating to the social customs, religion, and art
of the tribes, especial attention being given to investigations of the heraldry system
of the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache tribes as exemplified in the old-time shields and
decorated tipis. His work comprised the preparation of a full series of shield and
tipi models ona suitable scale, together with related investigations and collections.
The heraldry investigation and the model series for the confederated Kiowas and
Kiowa-Apaches are nearly finished and the latter is expected to constitute part of
the Smithsonian exhibit at the forthcoming Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The
complete model series may be estimated to contain 150 shields and 40 tipis for the
Kiowas and confederated Apaches, and a somewhat smaller number for the Chey-
ennes. In April Mr. Mooney shifted his base of operations from Mount Scott, in the
Kiowa country, to a station near Bridgeport, in the Cheyenne country, about 100 miles
north, and has since been moving about among the widely separated Cheyenne camps.
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Some weeks were devoted to a practical study of the hide-dressing process in all its
stages in connection with the making of a full-size skin tipi. This important industry
is thus for the first time placed fully on record. At the close of the present year
Mr. Mooney was preparing to attend the great annual sun dance of the Cheyennes,
to be held about the middle of July.

In addition to the research work referred to above, Mr. Mooney has assisted, both
in the field and during his brief stay in the office, in preparing material for the Dic-
tionary of Indian Tribes, in course of preparation by the Bureau.

The heraldry studies of Mr. Mooney have opened up a field entirely new to Ameri-
can ethnology, and are expected to contribute materially to our knowledge of many
questions heretofore imperfectly understood in relation to the social and military
organization, heredity laws, war customs, tabu system, and religious symbolism of
the Plains tribes. The urgency of the work may be judged by the fact that of per-
haps 300 shields in possession of the Kiowas a generation ago only 8 are now known
to be in existence (4 of which have been obtained by Mr. Mooney for the National
Museum), while more than half the information gained upon the subject came from
old men who have passed away since the investigation began.

During the year Dr. Cyrus Thomas, ethnologist, was engaged mainly on the Dic-

tionary of Indian Tribes, under the supervision of Mr. F. W. Hodge. In the early
months he made a final examination of the data relating to the Algonquian family,
and later took up the Siouan, Muskhogean, Timuquanan, and Natchesan stocks.
3rief articles on a number of the leading subjects intended for introduction into
the dictionary, such as Agriculture, Mounds, Mound-builders, Government, and
numerous biographical sketches of prominent Indians, have been prepared by
Doctor Thomas. He has thus contributed greatly to the interests of the Bureau in
a practical way, putting in final and concise form much of the knowledge accumu-
lated during his thirty years of service in his chosen field.

Doctor Thomas has been largely employed during preceding years, in direct asso-
ciation with Major Powell, in the important work of compiling a list of linguistic
families, languages, and dialects of the tribes of Mexico and Central America, and
the manuscript of this work, comprising some 200 typewritten pages, was submitted
by him at the close of the present year.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged in the
work of making an interlinear translation of a version of the Onondaga (Iroquoian )
cosmologic myth, obtained in the field in 1900 from Mr. John Arthur Gibson, an
intelligent and gifted Seneca priest. This text is by far the longest and fullest of
the five versions of this myth recorded by Mr. Hewitt during several field seasons.
Two of these texts are Seneca, two are Onondaga, and one is Mohawk. The
Mohawk text, related by Mr. Seth Newhouse, the shorter Onondaga text, told by
John Buck, and the longer Seneca text, told by John Armstrong, were sent to press
in the previous fiscal year. The longer Onondaga text contains more than 44,000
words in the Onondaga dialect, to about one-third of which an interlinear translation
has been added. The first draft of a free translation of it was completed in October
of the previous fiscal year. This manuscript will be ready for the press as soon as the
interlinear translation is completed and the free translation is revised. With it
will be submitted the shorter Seneca version, which is practically ready for the press.

Later in the year much work was done on portions of the ritual of the Condoling
Council of the League of the Iroquois. A free translation was made of the Onondaga
version of the so-called ‘* Fourteen Matters’? and also of the Mohawk yersion of the
‘* Address of Welcome’’ of the Brother Mourning Nations. The ‘‘Chant of Lamen-
tation,’’ requiring more than an hour to intone, was typewritten ready for interlinea-
tion. This work has enabied Mr Hewitt to ascertain approximately what is yet
needful to complete his projected monograph on the Condoling Council of the League
of the Lroquois.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

In September Mr. Hewitt, assisted by the Rey. Jesse Kirk, an educated and intel-
ligent Klamath quarter-blood Indian, undertook the special study of the system of
blood relationships and affinities among the Klamaths of the Lutuamian linguistic
family to ascertain whether or not these people have a clan system. This was done
by means of two charts, one for the paternal and the other for the maternal lines of
descent. It was shown by this study that the Klamaths have no clan system such
as that prevailing among the Iroquois. An extensive vocabulary of Klamath vocacies
was also obtained from the Rey. Mr. Kirk, covering 57 manuscript pages. Mr. Hewitt
also devoted much time to work in connection with the Dictionary of Indian Tribes,
furnishing, among other contributions, the articles ‘‘ Adoption,”’ ‘‘Confederacy,’’ and
“*Attakapan Family.”’

During the year Mr. Hewitt’s regular research work has been interfered with to a
very considerable extent by duties imposed in connection with the official corre-
spondence of the Bureau. Many communications were received calling for informa-
tion regarding the native languages, especially the significance of names and the
interpretation of phrases and sentences, and these were for the greater part referred to
Mr. Hewitt for report. Besides this a number of manuscripts forwarded for examina-
tion or for purchase have been placed in his hands for expert consideration.

In past years Mr. Hewitt has taken some part in the care of the great collection of
manuscripts in the Bureau vaults, and toward the close of the present year he was
appointed custodian of manuscripts. In this capacity he has again taken up the
work of identifying, classifying and cataloguing these documents—a work of no little
difficulty and requiring much time.

Dr. John R. Swanton was engaged for the greater part of the year in copying and
translating texts obtained by him from the Haida Indians of Queen Charlotte
Islands, British Columbia, during the winter of 1900-1901. There are two series of
these texts taken in the dialects of Skidegate and Masset, respectively. Of the Skide-
gate series there are 75 texts (one-third of which are war stories), covering about 360
typewritten pages, and of the Masset series about 90 texts, covering about the same
number of pages. These texts will be ready for publication early in the next fiscal
year.

Doctor Swanton has also been engaged in the preparation of a grammatical study
of the Haida language, which, while it is not exhaustive, will cover all essential
points. He has also in hand a dictionary of the Haida language.

Doctor Swanton has assisted Mr. Hodge in the compilation of the Dictionary of
Indian Tribes, and has revised, copied, and arranged all the descriptive material for
the Chimmesyan, Koluschan, Salishan, Skittagetan, Takilman, and Wakashan lin-
guistic families.

Dr. Albert 8. Gatschet has continued his linguistic work, giving principal attention
to the completion of a work on Algonquian texts, including the Peoria, Miami, and
Wea dialects. He has also made some progress in the preparation of a Peoria dic-
tionary and grammar, and in addition has rendered substantial aid in furnishing
linguistic data called for by correspondents of the Bureau.

Dr. Frank Russell, ethnologist, spent most of the previous year among the Pima
Indians of Arizona, and on the return journey paid a brief visit to the Muskwaki
tribein Iowa, reaching Washington in July. The report on his researches will appear
in the Twenty-fourth Annual Report of the Bureau under the title ‘‘The Pima
Indians of Arizona.’’ His active connection with the Bureau ceased on October 30,
but certain unfinished portions of the work were completed subsequently.

Dr. Stewart Culin, curator of anthropology in the museum of the Brooklyn
Institute, has made progress in the preparation of a monograph on native American
games which has been on hand for some years. It is planned to have it appear in
the Twenty-fourth Annual Report.

In September Mr. R. H. Partridge was commissioned by the Acting Director to
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

visit New Mexico for the purpose of mapping certain ancient ruins situated in the
valley of the Rio Hermoso, Socorro County. A month was spent in the work, and
the map produced and a brief report descriptive of the exploration have been placed
in the Bureau archives.

Dr. Albert E. Jenks, ethnologist, on furlough from the Bureau and connected with
the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes in the Philippine Islands, has communicated
some details of a successful expedition conducted by himself among the Bontoc
Igorrotes of northern Luzon. About the close of the year he became acting chief of
the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, Doctor Barrows, the chief, having been
appointed commissioner,of education for the islands.

Under. the immediate direction of Dr. Franz Boas, honorary ethnologist, impor-
tant linguistic studies were made by Mr. H. H. St. Clair, 2nd, among the Ute,
Shoshoni, and Comanche tribes. Numerous texts, grammatical notes, and vocabu-
laries were collected, and in parts of this work the phonograph was used with suc-
cess. The instrument was employed for recording the dictation of old men, and
then the record was repeated slowly by interpreters. During the winter months
Mr. St. Clair assisted Doctor Boas in the office, carrying forward various linguistic
studies. In addition, Mr. St. Clair continued work ona Chinook dictionary, on which
considerable progress had previously been made, and in June, 19038, he began work
among certain tribal remnants in Oregon, more particularly the Alsea, Coosa, and
Takilma.

Under Doctor Boas’s supervision Mr. William Jones continued his linguistic work
among the Sauks and Foxes. He has made a large collection of texts, all of which
have been copied, and has also elaborated a detailed grammar of the language of
these tribes. He has sueceeded in carrying out the analysis of the Algonquian
language in a much more satisfactory manner than did any of the older authors, such
as Baraga, Howse, Cuoq, and Lacombe. It is expected that the manuscript of his
grammatical studies will be completed by the end of the present calendar year. In
the spring of 1903 Mr. Jones made investigations of the language of the Kickapoos,
obtaining a considerable amount of linguistic material from among that tribe.

Besides directing the work of these assistants, Doctor Boas has continued hig
investigation of the grammar of the Tsimshian and Chinook languages.

The ripening of linguistic studies in America initiates a new era in this branch of
research. Powell gave great impetus to the work, and numerous other students
have devoted their energies assiduously to the important task of recording and clas-
sifying the American languages and applying the results to the elucidation of the
history of languages and peoples. The ultimate object of the work conducted under
the direction of Doctor Boas is a morphological classification of the languages of
America. The enumeration of linguistic stocks published by Major Powell in the
seventh annual report of the Bureau, is based entirely on vocabularies, many of which
are very brief. By means of the study of the morphology of languages more remote
relationships can be traced and the results of the lexicographer’s comparisons can be
checked. The grammatical studies that are carried on at present will therefore serve
to elucidate many of the obscure parts of the earlier history of our country and the
significance of the multitude of languages of California and the lower Mississippi
region. The work is being done in systematic cooperation with investigators not
connected with the Bureau. Among these are Dr. A. L. Kroeber, of the University
of California, Dr. Roland B. Dixon, of Harvard University, and’a few other students
who are collecting material in California, partly for the University of California,
partly for the American Museum of Natural History. Up to the present time the
Bureau has taken up, in connection with this work, morphological studies of the
languages of the northwest coast and of the Siouan, Shoshonean, and Algonquian
stocks, three of the largest on our continent. The work has so far advanced that it is
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

proposed to prepare at once a handbook of the American languages as a preliminary
publication.

The Bureau has had under way for some years the transcription of the Diccionario
de Motul, a manuscript Maya-Spanish dictionary, borrowed from the library of the
University of Pennsylvania. The copy is intended for the use of Sefor Andomaro
Molina, of Merida, Yucatan, who is engaged in compiling a Maya-English dictionary
to be published by the Bureau. The transcription was in the hands of Miss Jessie
E. Thomas, librarian of the Bureau, but her untimely death in January brought
the work to a close. The dictionary was returned to the university library on March
15, as previously arranged, but permission has since been granted to bring it again
to Washington when a competent copyist is found.

An important feature of the work of the year has been the preparation of material
fora dictionary of the Indian tribes. It was the Secretary’s wish that this under-
taking should be carried rapidly to completion, and Mr. F. W. Hodge, formerly of
the Bureau, but now connected directly with the parent Institution, was detailed to
take charge of the work. Mr. Hodge arranged to spend the afternoon of each day
at the Bureau, and was thus able to personally direct the work, a report on which is
here presented.

DICTIONARY OF INDIAN TRIBES.

At the time of the early exploration and settlement of North America there were
encountered many Indian tribes varying in customs and speaking diverse lan-
guages. Lack of knowledge of the aborigines and ignorance of their languages led
to many curious errors on the part of the early explorers and settlers; names
were applied to the Indians that had no relation whatever to those by which they
were aboriginally known; sometimes nicknames were bestowed, owing, perhaps, to
some personal characteristic, fancied or real; sometimes there was applied the name
given by another tribe, which was often opprobrious; frequently an effort was made
to employ the designation by which a tribal group knew itself, and, as such names
are often unpronounceable by an alien tongue and unrepresentable by a civilized
alphabet, the result was a sorry corruption, varying as the sounds were impressed
on English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Russian, or Swedish ears, or as they were
recorded in many languages, only to be as grossly corrupted when the next traveler
appeared.

Sometimes, again, bands of a single tribe would be given distinctive names, while
clans or gentes would be regarded as independent, autonomous groups to which
separate tribal designations were likewise applied. Consequently, in the literature
of the American Indians, which is practically coextensive with the literature of the
first three centuries of the New World, thousands of tribal names are encountered,
only a small proportion of which are recognizable at a glance; therefore, one of the
most practical and important studies which was undertaken at the inception of the
work of the Bureau was the classification of these names with the view of their pub-
lication as an Indian synonymy. As time passed, however, the scope of the work
was enlarged, for, as the studies of the Bureau were prosecuted, a large amount of
information in regard to the tribes, both past and present, was gained, so that it was
deemed desirable to make of the work a cyclopedia or dictionary of the Indians,
containing tribal synonyms,

The work continued at intervals during several years, most of the scientific corps,
particularly Mr. James Mooney, being engaged in the compilation, under the general
supervision of Mr. H. W. Henshaw, until 1891, when, owing to failure of health,
Mr. Henshaw was compelled to relinquish ethnologic work. Later the task was
assigned to Mr. Hodge, who continued it, so far as his other duties permitted, until
early in 1901, when he was transferred to the office of the Smithsonian Institution.
The work was continued, with many interruptions, until November of the present
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

fiscal year, when, as has been stated, Mr. Hodge was again assigned to the task. In
accordance with the Secretary’s wish, the scope of the work was enlarged to include
not only descriptions of the Indian stocks, confederacies, tribes, subtribes, phratries,
bands, clans, gentes, and settlements, as previously planned, but also biographies of
the most noted Indians, sketches of the native manners, arts, and customs, and a list
of Indian words incorporated into the English language.

The facilities of the Bureau were immediately made available, most of the scientific
corps deyoting at least a part of their time to the work, while the services of others
not officially connected with the Bureau were enlisted in directions in which their
special knowledge would be advantageous. To this end the Athapascan stock was
assigned first to Dr. Washington Matthews, whose ill health unfortunately com-
pelled him to relinquish it, when it was given to Dr. J. H. McCormick; the Atta-
‘apan, Beothukan, Iroquoian, and Uchean stocks were assigned to Mr. J. N. B.
Hewitt; the Chimakuan, Chinookan, Kalapooian, Kusan, Lutuamian, Shahaptian,
Takilman, Waiilatpuan, and Yakonan to Dr. Livingston Farrand; the Chimmesyan,
Koluschan, Salishan, Skittagetan, and Wakashan to Dr. John R. Swanton; the Cal-
fornian stocks to Dr. A. L. Kroeber and Dr. Roland B. Dixon; the Algonquian,
Chitimachan, Karankawan, Muskhogean, Natchesan, Shoshonean, Siouan, and
Timuquanan to Dr. Cyrus Thomas; the Caddoan to Mr. James Mooney; the Eski-
mauan, to Dr. J. H. Bair, and the Kitunahan to Dr. A. F. Chamberlain, while the
Piman and the Pueblo stocks were undertaken personally by Mr. Hodge. At the
close of the year the work on these stock and tribal descriptions had been well
advanced, most of the important as well as a number of the smaller linguistic groups
being entirely ready for final editorial revision. Owing to pressure of other duties,
a number of the specialists not’ officially connected with the Bureau required more
time than was expected, so that some of the outstanding material can not be finished
as soon as was desired.

In accordance with the plan of enlargement of the scope of the dictionary outlined by
the Secretary, a schedule of all the subjects thought to be necessary was prepared and
they were assigned to the specialists to be succinctly written. Those who have been
engaged in this part of the work are Mr. W. H. Holmes, Mr. F. W. Hodge, Dr. Cyrus
Thomas, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, Dr. A. F. Chamberlain, Mr. James Mooney, Prof. O. T.
Mason, Dr. Walter Hough, Miss Alice C. Fletcher, Dr. Washington Matthews, Dr.
J. R. Swanton, Mr. Joseph D. MeGuire, Dr. Frank Russell, and Mr. Stewart Culin.
At the close of the fiscal year nearly all of the 300 or more articles thus assigned were
completed, as was the bibliography of works cited in the tribal descriptions of the
dictionary. This latter was prepared by Mr. MeGuire.

For several weeks Mr. Hodge has been engaged in putting in final form the first
half of the material for the first of the proposed two volumes. The first of the
Algonquian descriptions (A to M), recorded on about 10,000 cards, were more than
half revised for the printer by the close of June, and many more stocks were awaiting
similar editorial treatment.

EXPOSITION WORK.

Eariy in the year an allotment of $2,000 was made by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, from funds placed at its disposal by the Government board of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition, to be used by the Bureau in preparing an exhibit for the
exposition. It is arranged that this exhibit shall comprise ethnological and archzeo-
logical collections illustrative of the research work of the Bureau, and instructions
have been given to members of the staff in the field to take up the work. Progress
has been reported by Dr. J. W. Fewkes, who will illustrate his researches in the
West Indies; by Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson, who will collect specimens illus-
trating Zuni arts and customs, and by Mr. James Mooney, who has in hand a series
of exhibits designed to represent the heraldic systems of the Plains Indians.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43
ILLUSTRATIONS.

The illustrations are a most important feature of the research and publication
work of the Bureau. They consist of drawings, photographs, rubbings, engravings,
etc., derived from many sources, and either used in the illustration of papers or
filed for reference. The photographic work includes the making of photographs of
all visiting Indians, copying pictures and maps, and photographing specimens.

Mr. DeLancey Gill has continued in charge of illustrations, the volume of work
being about the same as in previous years. The preparation of illustrations, the
criticism and revision of engravers’ proofs, and the photographic work have been
carried on in the usual manner. Illustrations for Doctor Fewke’s paper on his Porto
Rican studies, consisting of 25 original drawings and photographs, were prepared and
sent with the manuscript to the Public Printer. Engraved proofs of 330 drawings and
photographs, intended for use in the Twenty-second Annual Report, have been
received fromthe Public Printer during the year, and have been criticised and cor-
rected. The printed editions of 107 colored plates, representing nearly 1,000,000
impressions, to be used in the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Annual reports, have
been examined by Mr. Gill and the imperfect work rejected. Drawings to the
number of about 200, intended for forthcoming reports by Mrs. M. C. Stevenson and
Dr. Stewart Culin, were executed by contract under the supervision of the authors.
The preparation of illustrations for reports following the Twenty-third was taken
up toward the close of the year.

The photographic work has progressed satisfactorily. Six hundred and forty-six
6 by 83 inch negatives have been made 123 of which were exposed in the field by
Dr. Frank Russell and developed in the office laboratory. About five hundred 4 by 5
inch films were exposed in the field by Dr. Fewkes, and also developed in the office
laboratory, and a Jarge number of portraits of visiting Indians were made during
the year. In all, 1,146 negatives were added to the collection and 1,341 prints were
made.

Detailed plans by Mr. Gill of three of the great ruined buildings of Mexico, the
temple of Xochicaleo, the temple of the Columns, Mitla, and the House of the Govy-
ernor, Uxmal, were prepared for use in constructing models of the buildings for the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution.

COLLECTIONS.

For a number of years previous to the separation of the Bureau of Ethnology from
the Geological Survey, and also since the separation took place, the Bureau has made
extensive collections of objects illustrating its researches and forming the basis for
important studies. The collections have usually been catalogued on arrival at the
Bureau, and after serving their purposes for study and illustration have been trans-
ferred to the United States National Museum, where they have been recorded and
properly accredited to the Bureau.

During the year important collections have been made as follows: Archeological
collection from Santo Domingo and Porto Rico, by Dr. J. W. Fewkes, 1,210 speci-
mens; archzeological collection from an aboriginal hematite mine in Missouri, by W.
H: Holmes and Gerard Fowke, 160 specimens; collection of flint implements from
Indiana and Kentucky, by Gerard Fowke, many thousands of specimens; ethno-
logical collection from Zuni Pueblo, Arizona, by Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, 220 specimens.
These have been transferred to the National Museum along with numerous other
collections found in the Bureau offices and in storage. The latter include a large col-
lection from the Maine coast shell heaps, made by Mr. F. H. Cushing, 3,058 specimens;
an important collection of ethnological material from the Pima Indians of Arizona,
made by Dr. Frank Russell, 324 specimens, and numerous small collections and
single specimens. These collections have been accompanied by all available data
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

relating to them, and are so placed at the Museum as to be convenient for study by
the various collectors in preparing their reports and by students generally.

MANUSCRIPTS.

Of peculiar value and interest are the manuscripts brought together in the archives
of the Bureau. They number upward of 1,600 and relate chiefly to the Indian lan-
guages. Three hundred and thirty-two of these documents were transferred to the
Bureau on its organization by the Smithsonian Institution. Many others have been
presented to the Bureau since that time, while a large number have been purchased
from the authors. Nota few have been prepared by employees of the Bureau, and,
because fragmentary or not fully elaborated, have been filed awaiting completion and
for reference. A valuable body of linguistic data is thus preserved and available for
the use of students. Besides the linguistic materia] many miscellaneous manuscripts
and documents have accumulated. A few of these are historical, but, the majority
relate to the aborigines. These manuscripts are kept in two fireproof vaults in the
main office and haye been recently placed under the custodianship of Mr. J. N. B.
Hewitt, ethnologist.

PUBLICATIONS.

History of the series. —When the United States Geographical and Geological Survey
of the Rocky Mountain Region was discontinued, by act of Congress approved March
3, 1879, it had published two volumes (1 and 3) of a quarto series of Contributions to
North American Ethnology. The same act made an appropriation for completing and
preparing for publication other volumes of the series. The work was put in charge of
Maj. J. W. Powell, previously Director of the Rocky Mountatn Survey, and the
Bureau of Ethnology was organized. The new Bureau continued the publication of
the Contributions, and in 1880 the Director began a series of annual reports of prog-
ress to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, which were published, with
accompanying scientific papers, in handsomely illustrated royal octavo volumes.
The printing of the volumes of both series was at first specially authorized by Con-
gressional resolutions, but on March 2, 1881, volumes 6 to 10 of the Contributions
were provided for by a single resolution.

Under authority of a joint resolution of August 5, 1886, the Director of the Bureau
commenced in the following year the publication of a series of bulletins in octavo
form, unbound, which was continued by authority of the concurrent resolution of
July 28, 1888. The public printing act of January 28, 1895, which superseded all
previous acts and resolutions relating to public printing and binding, provided for
the continuance of the series of annual reports only. At that time there had been
published, or were in course of publication, 8 volumes of Contributions to North
American Ethnology, numbered 1-7 and 9, 24 bulletins, and 13 annual reports.

From 1895 to 1900 the Bureau issued the series of annual reports only, but on
April 7 of the latter year Congress passed a concurrent resolution authorizing the
commencement of a new series of bulletins in royal octavo, uniform with the annual
reports. Three numbers of this series (25 to 27) have been issued. The present
edition of both annual reports and bulletins is 9,682 copies, of which the Senate
receives 1,500, the House 3,000, and the Bureau 3,500 (of which 500 are distributed
by the Smithsonian Institution). From the remaining 1,682 are drawn the personal
copies of the members of Congress, those for the Library of Congress and a few other
Government libraries, and those sold by the Superintendent of Documents and
distributed by him to various libraries throughout the country.

Besides the series mentioned there have been issued small editions of several mis-
cellaneous publications intended chiefly or wholly for the use of collaborators and
correspondents. These comprise three introductions to the study of aboriginal
activities (one having been previously published by the Rocky Mountain Survey); a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

collection of Indian gesture signs; a set of proof sheets of a bibliography of North
American languages; a provisional list of the principal North American tribes, with
synonyms, and two samples of style for the Dictionary of American Indians, now in
preparation.

There have been issued up to the present time 19 annual reports, of which 4 are
in 2 parts; 27 bulletins, of which 24 are in octavo, unbound, and 38 are in royal
octavo, bound; 8 volumes of Contributions, of which one is in 2 parts; 4 introduc-
tions to the study of aboriginal activities, and 6 miscellaneous pamphlets—69 vol-
umes and pamphlets in all.

Subject-matter of the papers.—The papers published have covered the entire range of
aboriginal characters, activities, and history. Seven deal largely (3 of. them almost
wholly) with the classification of the tribes; almost all contain some cyclopedic
material, but only 1 is devoted to it chiefly, while 18 others have a large amount
of such material; 3 deal chiefly and 9 largely with history and tradition, and 3 are
concerned with relations with the whites as shown through land cessions and reser-
vations. Of those treating of aboriginal activities, 3 deal chiefly and 12 largely with
social organization; 50 are devoted to arts and industries, and 20 more contain con-
siderable material on this subject; 40 are devoted chiefly to linguistics and perhaps
35 to mythology and folklore, and a number of others contain material on both these
topics. The whole constitute a record of great practical value to those dealing with
the interests of the native tribes, and are of the utmost importance to the science
of man.

Publications of the year.—The Nineteenth Annual Report, Bulletins 25 and 27, and
a sample of style of the Dictionary of Indian Tribes (250 copies printed by the
Smithsonian Institution for the use of collaborators) have been issued during the
year, the Nineteenth Annual in October, 1902, Bulletin 25 in June, 1903, Bulletin 27
in January, 1903, and the pamphlet early in the same year.

Forthcoming publications.—The Twentieth, Twenty-first, and Twenty-second Annual
Reports are in press, the former being almost completed, and the Twenty-third
Report, containing Mrs. M. C. Stevenson’s paper on the esoteric and exoteric life of
the Zufi and Dr. Frank Russell’s paper on the Pima Indians, are nearly ready for
transmission to the Public Printer. A paper on Haida Texts, by John R. Swanton,
and a series of papers on Mexican and Mayan antiquities, history, and calendar
systems, by Eduard Seler, E. Férstemann, Paul Schellhas, Carl Sapper, and E. P.
Dieseldorff, is in preparation, and the following unassigned papers have been sub-
mitted: Algonquian Texts (Peoria, Miami, and Wea), by A. 8. Gatschet; List of
Linguistic Families of Mexico and Central America, by Cyrus Thomas.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE PUBLICATIONS.

Publications are sent to two classes of recipients: First, regularly, without special
request, to working anthropologists, public libraries, scientific societies, institutions
of learning, and others who are able to contribute to the work of the Bureau through
publications, ethnologic specimens, or manuscript notes; second, to others in response
to special requests, frequently indorsed by members of Congress.

_ During the year 1,380 copies each of the Nineteenth Annual Report and Bulletins
26 and 27 have been sent to regular recipients, about one-half of these going to the
United States, and 3,600 miscellaneous volumes and pamphlets have been sent in
response to about an equal number of special requests. More than 200 of these
requests have come through Congressmen, and about 400 volumes have been sent in
response.

EDITORIAL WORK.

The editorial work has been in charge of Mr. H. S. Wood, assisted during July,
August, and a part of September, 1902, by Dr, Elbert J. Benton. Several sets of
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

proofs have also been read by the job. The work has comprised the proof reading of
the Twentieth Annual Report, Bulletin 27, and Bulletin 25, and of the galleys of the
Twenty-first and Twenty-second Annual Reports, the preparation of a list of abbre-
viations for Bulletin 25, and the reading in manuscript of the Mayan and Mexican
papers already mentioned.

LIBRARY.

Although books and documents relating to ethnology were collected to a limited
extent by the Geological Surveys almost from their inception, the library of the
Bureau did not have a separate existence until 1882, at which time a librarian
was first appointed in the United States Geological Survey, with which organization
the Bureau was still domiciled. The systematic acquisition of volumes by purchase
and exchange was begun at this time, though the first entry in the accessions list
was not made until 1885. From then until the separation from the Survey the
record shows a steady though slow growth, as allotments for purchase were small.
At the time of the removal from the Survey building, in 1893, the accessioned vol-
umes numbered about 2,500. Since that date growth has been more rapid, partly
by reason of larger allotments for purchase, but chiefly through judicious exchange.
The library now contains 11,863 volumes, something over 6,000 pamphlets, and
several thousand numbers of periodicals, many of which should be bound and
entered on the accessions list.

Only works dealing with the American Indians and such general anthropologic
works as are needed for constant reference are purchased, though books and papers
dealing with all branches of anthropology and with related sciences are received by
exchange.

During the year there have been received 524 volumes, about 600 pamphlets, and
the current numbers of more than 500. periodicals.

PROPERTY.

The property of the Bureau may be comprised in seven classes, as follows: (1) Office
furniture, appliances, and supplies; (2) field outfits; (5) ethnologic manuscripts and
other documents; (4) illustrations—photographs, drawings, etc.; (5) books and
periodicals; (6) collections held temporarily by collaborators for use in research;
(7) undistributed residue of the editions of Bureau publications.

The additions to the office and field property during the year have been few and
unimportant. Numerous minor manuscripts have been added, principally in con-
nection with the Dictionary of Indian Tribes. The illustrations material has been
increased by several hundred negatives and by numerous prints and drawings. The
library has continued to grow steadily through exchange and purchase.

ACCOUNTS.

When the present Chief took charge of the office Mr. F. M. Barnett was occupying
the position of custodian of accounts and property. It was ascertained during the
spring that vouchers were being tampered with by him, and he was promptly arrested
and indicted.

A critical examination of the Bureau accounts thus became necessary, and all
papers connected with disbursements were at once turned over to the disbursing
officer of the Smithsonian Institution, who proceeded to give them the fullest atten-
tion. One noteworthy result of this examination was the discovery of the fact that
deficiencies existed for the years 1901 and 1902 amounting to between $600 and $700.
Fortunately the accounts at the close of the present year were in such shape that a
sufficient balance remains to liquidate this indebtedness if Congress so desires. At
the close of the year the accounting work was again placed in charge of the Bureau,
and along with its other affairs was reorganized and put on a proper business footing.

NECROLOGY.
JESSIE E. THOMAS.

On January 14, 1903, a skating accident caused the death of Miss Jessie E. Thomas,
librarian of the Bureau.

Miss Thomas was born at Carbondale, Ill., October 31, 1875. She received a pub-
lic school education, and studied French, German, and Spanish under private
teachers; and during four years which she spent as secretary and assistant to her
father, Dr. Cyrus Thomas, of the Bureau, she gained considerable knowledge of the
Maya langtage and of the literature relating to the American Indians in general, as
well as some experience in proof reading and in bibliographic work. She acquired
familiarity with library methods through attendance at the Columbian University,
Washington, D. C., and in May, 1900, was temporarily appointed to fill a vacancy in
the staff of the Bureau library, of which Mr. F. W. Hodge was then in charge. In
September the appointment was made permanent, after Miss Thomas had passed
highest on an examination given by the United States Civil Service Commission to
fill the position.

On Mr. Hodge’s resignation in the following January she was put in full charge,
and from that time until her death performed the difficult task of managing an
imperfectly arranged and catalogued library with marked ability. Much of her time
was taken up by the copying of the Motul Dictionary (Maya-Spanish, Spanish-Maya)
from the late Doctor Brinton’s collection, and in addition to her other duties she
gave considerable attention to bibliographlic studies intended to lessen the labors of
students of anthropology.

Her extreme carefulness and methodical habits are well illustrated by the perfect
order in which all her work was left, and her staunch character, her modest
demeanor and lovable disposition were highly appreciated by her associates.

JOHN WESLEY POWELL.

John Wesley Powell, founder and director of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
was born March 24, 1834, at Mount Morris, N.Y. He died September 23, 1902, at
his summer home in Haven, Me., and was buried with the honors due a soldier in
Arlington National Cemetery.

His boyhood was spent largely in the town of Jackson, Ohio, where his mind was
first directed toward the study of nature by James Crookham, an eccentric but able
teacher of the village youth. He was a student for brief periods in Jacksonville
and Oberlin colleges, and, taking up natural-history studies, traversed many sections
of the Middle West and South, observing, studying, and collecting. It was thus, no
doubt, that he acquired a decided bent for exploration, but it was probably his
experience as an officer in the civil war that developed the masterly qualities which
made him a leader among men and an organizer in the realm of science.

At the close of the war, declining political preferment, he resumed his scientific
studies and engaged in teaching and in lecturing on geology. During his con-
nection with Wesleyan University and the Illinois State Normal University he
conducted classes in the field, and thus became more and more fully a devotee of
research. In 1867 he found his way to the Far West, where later he reached the
climax of his career as an explorer in his memorable voyage down the Grand Canyon
of the Colorado. This expedition brought into play his splendid courage and com-
manding abilities, and the story of his adventures is fraught with deep romantic
interest. On these voyages of exploration contact with the native tribes gave him
an interest in ethnology, and thenceforth for many years his energies were divided
almost equally between the sciences of geology and anthropology.

Major Powell’s mind was so broadened and strengthened by the varied experiences
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of his early career that when he was called upon to enter the service of the nation
as explorer, geologist, geographer, and ethnologist he naturally assumed the role of
organizer. He gathered about him the best available men in the various depart-
ments of science, assigning them to the fields for which their abilities particularly
fitted them; but at all times he was the master spirit, compassing with clear vision
the widest horizon, and easily pointing the way to even the ablest. His vigorous
methods were an inspiration and his large-mindedness and generosity made a deep
impression on scores of students, who recognized the potent influence exerted by
the master.

As Director of the Geological Survey Major Powell originated and conducted many
enterprises of importance to science and to public welfare, but he was finally forced
by failing health to turn his back upon all branches of the public service save that
relating to the Indian tribes, and in 1893 he resigned the directorship of the Geo-
logical Survey to devote the remainder of his life to the science of man, and as
Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology achieved results that establish his
claim to lasting renown. The Bureau of American Ethnology is peculiarly his own,
the lines of research initiated by him being in the main those that must be followed
as long as the Bureau lasts, and in fact as long as the human race remains a subject
for study. Although the investigations made and directed by Powell related almost
exclusively to the American race, the results are so broad as to apply to all mankind.
It was a fortunate circumstance that his energies were directed to a field little
encumbered by the forms, methods, and determinations of earlier students, since it
enabled him to conduct his investigations on new lines and thus to raise the science
to a higher plane.

The great series of volumes published by the Bureau, more completely Powell’s
own than the world can ever know, are a splendid monument to his memory, a mon-
ument that will lose none of its impressiveness as the years and generations pass,
and when, a little later, the race of red men and their unique culture are but shad-
ows on the face of the world, and other primitive peoples have likewise passed for-
ever out of view, this monument that Powell has reared will stand, not only for
himself but for the nation among the most important contributions to human history
ever made by an individual, an institution, or a State. The world of the future,
viewing Powell’s career, will thank the guiding star that led the farmer boy to become
a teacher, the teacher a soldier, the soldier an explorer, the explorer a geologist, and
the geologist a historian of a vanishing race.

Respectfully submitted.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX III.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE

SERVICE.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Inter-
national Exchange Service during the year ending June 30, 1903.

The work required of this branch of the Smith-
sonian Institution is more essentially of a business
nature than that of any of its dependencies. The
duties of the Exchange Service consist chiefly of
transporting publications from Washington to all
foreign lands, however remote, and of receiving
publications from other countries, recording, and
forwarding them by registered mail to their respec-
tive addresses in the United States.

The requirements of the service necessitate the
handling of many packages, a large number of
which consist of heavy boxes. This fact renders it
necessary that the work should be conducted on the
ground floor, for which reason the south basement
of the Institution was remodeled ten years ago for
the express use of the Exchange Service and the
five rooms thus provided have since been applied
to its uses. These rooms have been furnished with
assorting tables, bins, record filing cases, and such
other office appliances as are necessary for the use of
clerks and other assistants.

Although several delays have occurred in the
delivery of parcels to addresses in other countries,
none of them has been due to negligence on the
part of the Institution. In some instances delay
was due to natural causes, and hence was unavoid-
able; but in the greater number of instances the
delay in delivery was by reason of the fact that
insufficient means are provided in some countries
for conducting their respective exchange bureaus in
a manner to insure prompt delivery of parcels for-
warded in their care.

So far as reported, in only ore instance during
the year has any damage occurred to exchanges in
transit, and even in this case it is believed that the
injury was only slight. In January, 1903, the
steamship La Savoie, of the Compagnie Générale
Transatlantique, while making a voyage from New
York to Havre, shipped water during a gale, and
a consignment of 13 cases for French correspondents
becoming wet a part of the contents was slightly
damaged. It may be regarded as quite remarkable

dred shipments were made during the year.

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In the report on the International Exchange Service for the year 1901 reference was
made to the loss of two cases of exchanges by fire and water in the hold of the steam-
ship Castano while loading at her pier in Brooklyn, preparatory to sailing for Aus-
tralian ports. This loss has now been adjusted, and the contributors of the packages
will soon be paid the approximate value of their respective publications.

No better proof can be desired of the appreciation of the facilities afforded the
public by the International Exchange Service than the constant increase in the num-
ber of transmissions by old patrons of the service as well as the growing use to which
the service is put by taking advantage of its privileges for the first time.

In order to appreciate the increase in the work of the year over that of the preced-

ing twelve months, it should be observed that, including all classes of exchanges,
150,217 packages, weighing 559,718 pounds, were handled in 1902-3, as against 125,796
packages, weighing 396,418 pounds, during the year 1901-2, an increase of 19 per
cent and 41 per cent, respectively. The average weight of all packages transmitted
during 1901-2 was 3 pounds, while the average per package during 1902-3 was nearly
4 pounds. ;

The total weight of exchange packages of domestic origin received during the year
for transmission abroad aggregated 419,191 pounds, while the weight of exchanges
from abroad was 140,527 pounds, or 75 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. These
figures apparently do not do justice to foreign contributors, especially those in remote
or thinly populated sections, since, being deprived of the advantages of accessible

Several changes in the foreign relations of the Exchange Service have occurred
during the year.

Through the good offices of the Department of State arrangements were consum-
mated with Cuba for a mutual exchange of official publications, and in December,
1902, 7 boxes were shipped to Habana to be deposited in the library of the depart-
ment of state at that capital.

On December 29, 1902, a reserve set of 52 cases was forwarded to the London
county council as an exchange for the municipal documents of the city of London.

Transmissions to Pretoria were interrupted at the beginning of the Transvaal war,
and the cases which had accumulated during hostilities were finally dispatched on
March 20, 1903, to the governor of the Transvaal Colony. Later advices indicate
that this set of documents will be deposited in the state library at Pretoria.

Regular shipments will be made in future to the depositories in Habana, Pretoria,
and London at the rate of about one case every two months.

In January, 1903, the Queensland government established an exchange board,
with headquarters in the Parliament House, Brisbane. This board has already
taken up the matter of international exchanges in a systematic manner, and satis-
factory results are sure to follow.

Until further notice the Exchange Service is constrained to discourage the for-
warding of parcels to the Smithsonian Institution for transmission to China except
those bearing addresses in Shanghai.

Reference has frequently been made in these reports to the restrictions placed

upon exchanges forwarded to Japan for distribution. The department of foreign
affairs at Tokyo, to which all consignments are sent by the Smithsonian Institution,
is willing to receive only parcels designed for official institutions of the Japanese
Government or for individuals connected therewith. Although frequent attempts
have been made to induce the foreign office to distribute all contributions for
Japanese correspondents, they have thus far been of no avail.

The United States minister to Ecuador has called the attention of the Institution
to the delay and expense occasioned in transporting exchanges to Quito by mountain
trail from the port of Guayaquil, and suggests that only documents of great impor-
tance be sent to Quito until the railroad which is now building from the coast shall
be completed, about two years hence.

tries receiving regularly exchanges through the Institution:

The 50 sets of official documents provided by the joint resolution of Congress
approved March 2, 1867, have all been placed in appreciative hands in other coun-
tries, as noted.in the preceding list. Finding that a still further exchange with for-
eign governments was necessary in order to increase the collections in the Library of
Congress, a joint resolution was approved March 2, 1901, providing 62 sets for distri-
bution abroad in lieu of 50 sets as formerly, and further provision was made by this
resolution for increasing the number of sets to 100 on the request of the Librarian of
Congress.

The distribution of the additional sets provided for by the joint resolution of March
2, 1901, has been made through the International Exchange Service to such foreign
depositories as the Librarian of Congress in his judgment has deemed expedient,
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

having solely in view the procurement of such publications in exchange as were
especially desired by that library.

On account of lack of space in the Smithsonian building for storing the additional
sets provided for by the resolution of 1901, these documents have been delivered
from the Government Printing Office to the Library of Congress, and in turn are
forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution from time to time for transmission abroad
as negotiations are consummated. When depositories for all these additional sets
shall have been arranged for, however, it is expected that the documents will be
delivered directly from the Government Printing Office to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and that all uniform sets will then be shipped abroad at the same time and
accompanied by duplicate printed lists of the contents of each case, as is now custom-
ary when shipments are made to the original 50 depositories.

The following is a list of the new depositories to which consignments have been
made during the year:

British Columbia: Legislative Assembly, Victoria.

Cape Colony: Colonial Governor, Cape Town.

France: Prefecture de la Seine, Paris.

Germany: Foreign Office, Bremen.

Guatemala: Secretary of the Government, Guatemala.

Jamaica: Colonial Secretary, Kingston.

Manitoba: Provincial Library, Winnipeg.

Natal: Colonial Secretary’s Office, Pietermaritzburg.

New Brunswick: Legislative Library, Fredericton.

Northwest Territories: Government Library, Regina.

Nova Scotia: Legislative Library, Halifax.

Prince Edward Island: Legislative Library, Georgetown.

Dr. Felix Flugel, Messrs. William Wesley & Son, and Dr. Joseph von Kérésy con-
tinue to act as agents of the Institution in Leipzig, London, and Budapest, respec-
tively. In each instance the interests of the Institution generally, and those of the
International Exchange Service in particular, are conducted with rare ability.

To those correspondents abroad who give their personal attention and doubtless
often expend private medns in furthering the interests of international exchanges at
large the grateful acknowledgment of the Institution should be accorded.

The appreciation of the Smithsonian Institution and its branches is due to Mr.
Charles A. King, deputy collector of the port of New York, for his constant assist-
ance in clearing assignments from abroad for the Institution. I desire to commend
also the efficiency and faithfulness of the employes of the exchange service through-
out the year.

Respectfully submitted.

The appropriation for the general service of the park was made in the following
terms:

For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage
and drainage; and for grading, planting, and otherwise improving the grounds; erect-

sm 1903

ing and repairing buildings and inclosures; care, subsistence, purchase, and_trans-
portation of animals, including salaries or compensation of all necessary employees;
the purchase of necessary books and periodicals, the printing and publishing of
operations, not exceeding one thousand five hundred copies, and general incidental
expenses not otherwise provided for, ninety thousand dollars.

An additional appropriation was made as follows:

For the construction of an elephant house, with bathing pools and other accesso-
ries, including labor and materials and all necessary incidental expenses, ten thousand
dollars; one-half of which sums for the National Zoological Park shall be paid from
the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other half from the Treasury of the
United States. (Sundry civil act June 28, 1902.)

In submitting estimates to Congress $20,000 was specified for the elephant house.
Only half of this amount was appropriated, which was altogether inadequate for such
a building as had been planned—in fact, was sufficient only to inclose the required
space with the cheapest possible construction having the necessary strength.

The preparation of new plans and specifications adapted to the amount available
was begun as soon as the appropriation had been made and a contract for the work
was let early inSeptember. Work under the contract was commenced promptly and
pushed as rapidly as circumstances would permit. . There was some unavoidable
delay in securing materials, but the building was completed early in January, 1903.
The contract covered building proper, outdoor bathing pool, and fence for outside
yard, and amounted to $8,594. Boiler and heating pipes and some other interior fit-
tings and guard rail around outside yard were not included in the contract, this
work being done by day labor. The total cost, including architect’s commission, was
$10,000. About $500 also was expended from the general appropriation in necessary
grading and construction of walks in the immediate vicinity.

The house is a plain, barn-like structure of brick, 35 by 65 feet inside, a space 35
feet square being provided for the elephant, a 10-foot passage reserved for attendants,
and a space 20 by 35 feet for the public. The outside yard is 79 by 96 feet and
includes a concrete bathing pool 20 feet in diameter and 6 feet deep. The fence is
6 feet high, constructed of steel throughout, and consists of I-beam posts, channel-
beam rail, and pickets of 24-inch stiff, round steel 19 inches apart. Both posts and
pickets are set in a heavy concrete base. A bar of 2-inch half-round iron, in which
are set small pointed steel knobs, is fastened along the inner side of the rail to dis-
courage the elephant from pushing against it. An area between the yard and pool,
protected by a stockade, has been planted with shrubs and trees, which will soon
shade to a considerable extent both yard and pool. The accompanying illustration
shows the exterior appearance of the house and yard. The elephant was put in the
house March 12, 1903.

Besides the regular cost of maintenance, several important improvements have
been made during the year from the general appropriation.

Boundary fence.—The Secretary had. for several years been urging upon Congress
the need of replacing the wooden boundary fence, which was constructed in 1890.
There was an increase of $10,000 in the general appropriation over the sum provided
for the previous year, and this amount was applied to the construction of a new fence.
Work was begun soon after the appropriation became available, and the fence was
completed during autumn, except on a small portion of the boundary, where the
grades are being changed to conform to newly constructed highways of the District of
Columbia. The fence consists of Page woven-wire fencing, 72 inches wide, of extra,
strength, and carried on posts of heavy iron pipe set in concrete bases. Three barbed
wires are used above, making the total height 90 inches. Heavy galvanized netting:
extends 12 inches into the ground below fer security against dogs.

The amount available was not sufficient to provide suitable entrance gates, and
temporary gates were made with wire fencing attached to a light frame of angle iron.
The total cost of the fence was $10,000.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

In connection with the building oie fence it became necessary to reestablish
certain points on the boundary line where the grading of District highways had dis-
placed the original marks or where the line had been altered since the official sur-
vey was made. The surveyor of the District of Columbia was accordingly employed
to resurvey the boundary and prepare a new and authoritative map.

Bear yards.—Two bear yards begun at the close of the previous year have been
completed. Provision has been made fora series of 10 yards, and the site for the
entire series has been graded. The two central cages of the series were built and are
occupied, respectively, by the Kodiak bear and the pair of polar bears. These cages
are approximately 40 feet square, and each contains a bathing pool about 20 feet in
diameter. The fence is 10 feet high, with an overhang inward of 2 feet 6 inches. It
is constructed of vertical bars of #-inch stiff, round steel, spaced 5 inches on centers,
passing through horizontal rails of 2} by { inch round-edged steel. Each yard is
provided with a house in the rear, the front of which is of large weathered rocks laid
up with wide irregular joints. Rear walls are of concrete. Each house has a grating
door at front and rear and a grating across one end the entire width of the house.
In winter a tight storm door is fitted into the rear opening, and the open end of the
house is closed with a wooden panel. The door at the front is closed with a sliding
grating, operated outside the house. There is also a grating door at the rear of the
yard for the use of keepers, all attendance being from the rear. The cost, including
grading, drainage, and water supply, has been $3,000. Trees have been planted
about the cages, which after a few years will shade both animals and visitors. A
trellis of light steel framework has been constructed over the public walk and the
front part of the cages, and over this quick-growing vines are being trained, which
will afford shade till the trees reach sufficient size to render such shade unnecessary.

Eagle cage.—This structure.also was begun as the last fiscal year ended. It was
completed early in the present year and at once occupied. The cage has proved to
be very satisfactory, and it is hoped that in the near future similar structures can be
built for other birds of prey, especially for the California condors, which now have to
be kept ina cage of quite inadequate size.

The following alterations and additions have been made to buildings and grounds
during the year:

Improvements in aquarium.—The small aquarium maintained for several years in
an old work shed proved to be of so much interest to visitors that it seemed advisa-
ble to make some alterations in order to provide more satisfactory conditions for
operation and exhibition. Under your instructions the lighting, which had been
insufficient, was improved by putting in a continuous series of skylights on the north
side and doubling the skylight area on the south side. A new exhibition tank, 12
feet long, 3 feet 10 inches high, and 5 feet deep, was constructed at the end of the
corridor. A second concrete storage tank for salt water was built and an extra pump
and additional piping put in, so that the entire series of tanks on one side and the
new end tank can be supplied with salt water. It was also recognized that a bare
background of asphalted wood did not display fishes to advantage or give any proper
idea of the surroundings in which they ordinarily live. Some of the tanks have
therefore been lined with rock of different kinds, while in others cement has been
combined with gravel and waterworn stones to give the background the appearance
of a natural bank. Fresh-water plants, marine algee, sponges, etc., have been used
as accessories in these tanks to produce, so far as possible, the appearance of natural
conditions. The improvement thus made has been appreciated by the public as well
as favorably commented on by persons engaged in aquarium work.

A large mirror has been installed on the roof of the aquarium and so connected
that it throws sunlight at all times of day, through colored glass, into one of the
tanks.

68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

o

Addition to temporary bird house.—It was found to be necessary to further enlarge
the temporary bird house in order to furnish winter quarters for birds from the
large flying cage. An extension 50 feet long and 35 feet wide was built at the north
end with a height of 20 feet. The end of this extension was made into a single cage,
20 by 35 feet, extending the full height of the building and provided with a pool,
trees, etc. A considerable part of the birds from the flying cage were kept here dur-
ing the winter. This addition made it possible to keep birds in a fairly comfortable
manner, but, with accessions which have come in during the current year, especially
from United States officers abroad, the collection has again quite outgrown the
accommodations.

Repairs to antelope house.—When this house was built it was necessary, on account
of insufficiency of funds, to use the cheapest materials. Asa natural result some
parts of the structure have already given away from decay. During the year it
became necessary to put new floors in all of the large cages. The wooden floors
were removed and replaced by a macadam surface on a base of stone laid in the
‘“Telford’? manner. Concrete walls were built to sustain the front of the cages and
the partitions. New double partitions were also constructed, with doors sliding into
them, and the outer wall was ceiled for greater warmth.

Repairs to inclosures.—Several of the inclosures for ruminant animals have required
repairs during the year. The elk paddock was in such bad condition that the wire
fencing had to be replaced for a distance of 100 rods, and at least an equal amount ~
additional will have to be rebuilt very soon. A fence possessing at once the desirable
qualities of lightness, strength, and durability is apparently not yet obtainable.

‘Work on roadways. —No new roadways have been constructed during the year, but
the driveway connecting witli Klingle road was rebuilt for a distance of 300 feet in
order to conform to the new grade established for that road. The ford on this drive-
way was also paved with concrete, as the current of Rock Creek frequently eroded
the natural bed at that point to such an extent as to render the crossing unsafe for
carriages. Since this improvement was made there has been no further trouble of
this kind. It also became necessary to remove the metaling from the roadway
between Quarry road entrance and the bridge over the creek, as a considerable fill
was required there to connect with the new entrance road constructed by the District
at that point.

New entrance road from Kenesaw avenue.-—The appropriations for the District of
Columbia included the following item: ‘‘ For Kenesaw avenue, entrance to Zoological
Park, grading (and the Commissioners of the District of Columbia are authorized to
adjust the lines of the streets at this locality so as to afford an entrance to the
Zoological Park upon good and satisfactory grade, with authority to exchange with
the owners of the abutting property any land now within the lines of said streets
that may be necessary to accomplish said purpose: Provided, That no expense is
incurred thereby by the United States or the District of Columbia), ten thousand
dollars.’’

This entrance roadway has been graded throughout to a width of 50 feet. It has
not as yet been otherwise improved, but will probably be graveled soon. A fill was
required the entire length of the road, which extends into the park about 200 feet,
and the side slope encroaches on the park the whole length. The park is now bor-
dered on the east side from Quarry road to Klingle road by a bank of raw earth as
steep as it will stand and from 15 to 40 feet high. Measures will have to be taken
to protect the meadow and woodland below from the wash, also to plant the slope
so as to screen it and cover it with a growth of vegetation which will hold the earth
and prevent erosion.

Important accessions.—Dr. F. W. Goding, United States consul at Newcastle, New
South Wales, secured for the park during the year the most important collections
yet received from any one source, amounting to more than 140 specimens, among
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

which were a Tasmanian zebra wolf with 3 young, a Tasmanian deyil, 3 echidnas, 13
kangaroos of various species, 3 phalangers, 2 flying phalangers, 4 native cats ( Dasy-
urus), a black-backed jackal, a pair of emus, 30 cockatoos and paroquets, a wedge-
tailed eagle, a pair of black swans, and many other birds. A number of these
animals were gifts from Doctor Goding, or through him, from persons in Australia
who are interested in natural history; others which were especially difficult to obtain
were purchased by Doctor Goding at small cost through correspondents in remote
parts of Australia and Tasmania. His wide acquaintance throughout the Australian
region and knowledge of its fauna made it possible for Doctor Goding to secure a
thoroughly representative collection, and acknowledgment is here given of the grat-
itude of the park and of its obligation to Doctor Goding for his valuable assistance.
Some of the animals mentioned are shown in Plate IT.

E. H. Plumacher, United States consul at Maracaibo, Venezuela, presented a
monkey, a deer, a peccary, 2 agoutis, and several iguanas, parrots, and owls.

E. 8. Cunningham, United States consul at Aden, Arabia, presented a fine speci-
men of caracal.

An officer of the Sudan government offered to the President of the United States a
young lion, which was secured for the park. Dr. H. T. McLaughlin, of the Ameri-
can mission at Omdurman, kindly attended to the forwarding of the animal, which
proved to be a fine male about 12 months old. ~

The President presented to the park a bay lynx and a black bear.

Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C., presented a fine male Arabian baboon.

Capt. John L. Young, of Young’s Pier, Atlantic City, N. J., presented the aqua-
rium with a number of interesting fishes and also assisted materially in securing other
specimens.

The Yellowstone National Park, through its acting superintendent, Maj. John
Pitcher, U. 8. Army, furnished a fine male grizzly bear, weighing 500 pounds.
Exchanges were made during the year with the New York Zoological Park; Lincoln
Park, Chicago; the Zoological Garden at Buffalo, N. Y., and various private indi-
viduals, by means of which surplus animals were disposed of and desirable speci-
mens obtained. births increased somewhat in number over the previous year, and
it is of interest to note that the beavers have again bred, this time producing three
young.

Purchases included a young female lion obtained for the park by the United States
consul at Aden, Arabia, a specimen of the Oregon cougar, 2 fishers, a female moose
as a mate for the male already in the collection, 4 Cuban flamingos, also a male
Mama and several birds which did not arrive until after the close of the fiscal year.

The young brown bear obtained on the mainland of Alaska, opposite Kodiak
Island, in May, 1901, made a very satisfactory growth and weighed, in June of this
year, 450 pounds. Its weight when captured was 18 pounds. This bear is probably
of the kind recently described as Ursus gyas.

Losses of animals.—The most important were 5 American bison, 3 of which died
from gastro-enteritis, 1 from abscess of the stomach, and 1 from pyzemia; 2 wood-
land caribou, 2 prong-horn antelopes, also 15 monkeys, the loss of which must be
charged mainly to lack of proper housing.

Autopsies on a considerable proportion of the animals which died were made by
the Bureau of Animal Industry of the United States Agricultural Department, and
facts of interest were learned as well as information secured which will be of service
to the park in the future.

One draft horse and one saddle horse were condemned during the year as unfit
for use and were sold at public auction.

The urgent need of a house for small mammals was brought to the attention of
Congress, and, while no separate appropriation was made for this purpose, it is hoped
that from the slightly increased general appropriation for the year 1904 a sufficient
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

amount can be reserved to erect at least a part of the building. Plans for the house
are already well under way.

It would be of the greatest advantage to the park if immediate provision could be
made for its most vital needs. A central heating plant is one of the indispensable
features of a permanent equipment and must be put in ultimately. The establish-
ment of such a plant will result not only in direct and immediate economy through
reducing the amount of fuel and the number of firemen required, but it will also
save the expense of providing each building erected with a separate heating plant,
and will remove from all the public exhibition houses the dirt, smoke, and other
inconveniences which necessarily attend the operation of a heating plant in the
building.

Need of a suitable public comfort house equipped for ladies and children and
with provision for a restaurant has before been mentioned and is again urged. The
present insufficient arrangements are becoming each year more unsatisfactory and
objectionable. It may be mentioned that accommodations of this kind are among
the most important features in all of the leading zoological gardens.

Attention is again called to the great desirability of providing permanent build-
ings for animals sufficient to keep pace with the growth of the collections, so that
there may be no further necessity for putting up cheap temporary structures, which
are never satisfactory and entail a greater final cost than would result were perma-
nent houses provided at the outset.

During the past year the acquisitions of property of the kind just enumerated have —
been as follows:

(a) Apparatus.—Astronomical and physical apparatus has been purchased at an
expenditure of $3,600, the chief pieces so procured being in connection with the
installation of a long-focus horizontal reflecting telescope of 20 inches aperature and
140 feet focus.

(b) Library and records. —The usual periodicals have been continued and additional

ooks of reference have been purchased, while 184 volumes of periodicals and books
of reference have been bound. There has been expended for these several purposes
$460, of which sum $254.50 was chargeable to the appropriation for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1902.

No repairs of buildings worthy of note have been made during the year, but the
Observatory inclosure was enlarged for the better accommodation of the great hori-
zontal telescope by removing 39 feet at the western end of the south fence to a posi-
tion 20 feet to the south.

No noteworthy losses of property have occurred.

Ture Work OF THE OBSERVATORY.

For convenience the work of the Observatory will be considered under three heads,
as follows:

1. Publications and miscellaneous matters.

2. The new horizontal telescope and other apparatus.
Investigations relating to the atmospheric absorption and to the solar constant
of radiation.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. UG

occasional assistance in matters of a physical or astronomical nature connected with
the Institution. Among experimental undertakings of this kind may be mentioned
the rough measurement of the absorption of certain substances for infra-red radia-
tions, made at the request of some correspondents of the Institution.

Personnel.—No changes have been made in the permanent staff of the Observatory.
Doctor Gilbert completed his temporary services on August 15, 1902, and Dr. J. R.
Benton filled a temporary appointment from September 16, 1902, to November 30,
1902.

2. The new horizontal telescope and other apparatus.

Referring to my report of last year, it will be recalled that preliminary attempts
had been made to measure the absorption of the gases of the solar envelope by bolo-
graphic study of an enlarged solar image, and that it was your intention to continue
the work so as to include the bolographic study of sunspot spectra, but that these
researches were temporarily laid aside till a more suitable arrangement for forming
and guiding the solar image could be obtained. Much study and experiment
has been devoted to this matter in the past year, and as a result a horizontal reflect-
ing telescope of 20 inches aperture and 140 feet focus has been obtained, and pro-
vided with a tube in which the air can be thoroughly stirred to overcome ‘‘boiling,”’
in accordance with the experiments reported last year. To ‘‘feed’’ this horizontal
telescope a modification of the coelostat has been devised which is believed to be
before untried, and which renders this simple instrument so well adapted for
the purpose of solar research that it is hoped that the device will approve itself
elsewhere.

A large instrument of this type has been constructed by the J. A. Brashear Com-
pany, of Allegheny, Pa., and will form a part of the Astrophysical Observatory
exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904. All the above
- apparatus, including the coelostat, long-focus mirror, tube and air-stirring devices,
and three great piers for the coelostat, concave mirror, and bolometric apparatus for
the study of the image, are now in use. The accompanying illustration, Pl. IV,
shows the great coelostat and a portion of the tube which incloses the beam from
the coelostat to the concave mirror, 55 feet north, and thence south and under the
coelostat to the plane of the focal image. It will be noted by the reader that the
beam is reflected in the plane of the meridian from the first plane mirror mounted
on a polar axis which turns half as fast as the earth, and that a second reflection
occurs at the surface of a second plane mirror, adjustable about two horizontal axes,
and also capable of moving bodily, by means of tracks, east and west and north and
south. Thus the second mirror can receive the beam at any hour of any day of the
year, and reflect it in any desired direction. In practice a nearly horizontal and
northerly direction is chosen.

Pl. IIT is from the working drawing of the tube, which is an acute V in general
shape, with alonger branch of circular cross section extending from the concave
mirror on the northern pier to the focus, 140 feet distant on the southern, and with
a shorter branch uniting with the longer at its northern end, but proceeding south-
ward and inclined upward at an angle of 6° and ending at the coelostat, 55 feet dis-
tant. This shorter branch is circular at its northern end, but broadens out to an
elliptical cross section, asshown, in order to inclose the beam for the east and west
positions of the second coelostat mirror. Both branches of the tube are of galyanized
iron, with two walls separated by an air space 13 inches thick all around. The inner
tube is blackened and is provided with diaphragms.

In Plate III is also shown the air ducts which are employed for stirring in the great
tube. Starting from the blowing engine, which is a 29-inch circular fan blower, with
direct-connected 23-horsepower electric motor, making 700 revolutions per minute,
the blast is carried by a 20-inch main to a point near the middle of the tube, where
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the air duct branches into two 14-inch tubes, which proceed north and south respec-
tively and communicate by 5-inch pipes to the interior of telescope tube. At points
intermediate with these other 5-inch pipes lead out of the telescope tube and thence
by return mains to the suction end of the blower, and thus the same air is continually
being churned about through the entire system.

To prevent the blowing engine and the city traffic from communicating prejudicial
tremors to the apparatus, three deep and massive piers have been constructed, sup-
orting respectively the coelostat, the long-focus concave mirr or, and the spectro-
bolometric apparatus used to investigate the solar image. Each pier is contained in
a pit originally 12 feet square and 10 feet deep, but supported by retaining walls of
grouting 1 foot thick, so as finally to leave a cubical-shaped pit 10 feet onaside. At
the bottom is a layer of sand 2 feet deep, and on this a base of grouting 2 feet thick
and 9 feet square, supporting the brick pier, which is built to the surface of the
ground 7 feet square, with 18-inch walls on the four sides and a 13-inch wall north
and south through the center. Over all is the capstone, 8 feet north and south, 7
feet east and west, and 7 inches thick. In the case of the coelostat pier a two-walled
brick superstructure is carried up to the top of the horizontal tube to support the
base plate of the coelostat. In spite of all these precautions I regret to report that
the disturbance from passing traffic and even distant railroad trains has not been suf-
ficiently eliminated, and requires further measures to be taken to overcome the
almost unconquerable difficulties of the site.

Owing to prolonged cloudy weather, the apparatus had not been fully tried between
the time of its installation, about June 1, and the close of the period covered by this
report, but, so far as preliminary experiments have shown, the whole promises to be
a valuable equipment if the tremors due to the site can be corrected.

The sensitive galvanometer.—Referring to portions of my reports of preceding years
describing the construction and installation of a highly sensitive galvanometer, I
regret that attention has been diverted this year to other matters so completely that
comparatively little work has been done with it. In the fall of last year an appa-
ratus was arranged to measure the heating effect of the brighter stars by its aid, but
unfortunately communication with the mercurial air pump had so quickly blackened
the silvered galvanometer mirrors that this, together with their almost microscopic
size, made it impossible to read the galvanometer by artificial light. After several
trials numerous mirrors were platinized by electrical discharge in vacuo and the gal-
vanometer was provided with mirrors of this kind, but immediately after the experi-
ments were discontinued to take up work on the provision of the great horizontal
telescope. It is hoped to provide for the use of this special galvanometer in spectrum
work on the solar image, especially in connection with sun spots, and perhaps upon
the heat of the stars.

3. Investigations relating to the solar constant of radiation.

Referring to my last year’s report, the bolographic measurements of atmospheric
absorption then described have been continued chiefly in the hands of the junior
assistant, Mr. Fowle, with improved arrangements and with more complete and
exact results. In connection with them the absorption of the radiation in all parts
of the apparatus has been determined frequently, and measures of the total solar
radiation by the actinometer or pyrheliometer have been made also. From these
several kinds of data the solar constant of radiation, or rate of receipt of solar energy
at the outer limit of our atmosphere, has been computed for a number of the best
days.

Improvement of bolographs.—Betore giving these values, I invite attention to Plate
V, which shows three superposed energy curves of the prismatic solar spectrum.
Such bolographic curyes are now obtained covering the region of spectrum from

wave length 0.3875 to wave length 2.5 in about twenty-five minutes of time. This
region extends from beyond the line ‘“‘L,”’ or farther than the eye can see without
special means in the ultra violet, through the whole visible spectrum, and on through
the visible but very intense upper infra-red spectrum as far as glass is transparent.
It includes about ;°°°, of the solar radiation which reaches the earth’s surface, and
so far as experiment has shown, within 1 and 2 per cent of all that reaches the outer
layers of the earth’s atmosphere lies within this spectral region.

It is only since January, 1903, that the apparatus has been so far perfected as to
include in the regular bolographic work the important portion lying between 0.375/2
and 0.47“, andin Plate V readers may see for the first time, as the bolometer recog-
nizes them, the general features of the violet solar spectrum so familiar in photo-
graphic spectra. It is, of course, impossible to show the finer details when the bolom-
eter passes through the whole visible and upper infra-red spectrum in less time
than was occupied in passing from through a fourth of the upper infra-red alone in
preparing the detailed map published in 1900; but nevertheless in a rough compar-
ison of three curves it was seen that as many as 325 of the Fraunhofer lines were
discriminated by the bolometer as it passed over them thus rapidly. As remarked
last year, scarcely any ‘‘ dritt’’ of the galvanometer is now experienced, and, indeed,
it is sometimes possible to take bolographs for a month without readjusting the
bolometric circuit in any way. This excellent behavior is principally due to the
improved rheostat and to the 16-coil type of galvanometer, both of which were men-
tioned on page 87 of last year’s report.

Transmission of the atmosphere.—From series of such bolographs as are described at
page 89 in my last year’s report, coefficients of transmission of the atmosphere are
obtained. It is now customary to compute them for more than 30 points in the
spectrum between wave lengths 0.37 “ and 2.5 yw, of which 24 are at wave lengths
where there are no prominent atmospheric bands and the others within such bands.
The reduced observations take such a form that they may be graphically platted as
straight lines whose angle of inclination is a measure of the transmission coeflicient
of the air at the given wave length. It is the exactness with which the reduced
observations from the bolograph fall upon such straight lines which furnishes the
principal criterion of their value. To show how close this agreement is on the best
days, I invite attention to Plate VI, which gives for several wave lengths the reduc-
tions of the observations of March 25 and 26, 1903, respectively. Ordinates are
logarithms of heights of the bolographic curves at the selected wave lengths and
abscissve are air masses.

The cireles represent observations of March 25 and crosses those of March 26.
Lines I and II are for a wave length of 1.027 ~; Ill and IV at 0.656 ~; V and VI at
0.468 , and VII and VIII at 0.395 u. On nearly all days of observation it is found
that the forenoons yield a less regular series than the afternoons, and it appears as if
the air became clearer and clearer till a little after noon and then remained substan
tially unchanged on the best days till 4 or 5 o’clock p. m. It is therefore the practice
here to use only afternoon observations in determining atmospheric transmission.
The forenoon observations are distinguished in Plate VI by being connected by dotted
lines.

Notable decrease in the transparency of the air in the present calendar year.—From
numerous determinations of the transmission of the air for solar radiations, a
striking diminution of the transmission has been noted in the best days of this year
as compared with last year. To illustrate this difference I give the following table:

It is to be regretted that the earlier work did not reach up so far in the violet as
we now observe, but the trend of the observations makes it appear that the trans-
parency of the air for the extreme visible violet rays may be 30 per cent less than
last year, and that the transparency for the visible and infra-red spectrum as a whole
has diminished by 10 per cent. If this change is widespread it should be likely to
influence climate, and that it is widespread the falling off of actinometric observa-
tions both in this country and Europe, as reported by several observers, would seem
to indicate.

Selective atmospheric absorption.—Referring to fig. 38, page 89, of my last year’s report,
the depression at a wave length of 0.58 in the curve there shown would appear less
marked in the more recent results, owing to the great decrease in transparency for
the blue and violet rays; but nearly all recent work gives evidence of bands of dimin-
ished atmospheric transmission at wave lengths 0.43, 0.48, and 0.58.

Interesting results have been obtained in respect to the atmospheric transmission
within the great bands of water vapor and oxygen, and it has been found, in con-
firmation of the accuracy of the observations, and especially of the exponential
formula employed in reducing them, that the values of transmission coefficients
within the water-vapor bands of the infra-red are such as would very nearly obliter-
ate these bands from an energy-spectrum curve corrected to represent the distribution
of solar radiation in the spectrum outside the earth’s atmosphere.

nometer of M. Croya’s well-known design, and constructed under M. Crovya’s personal
direction, was received at the Observatory. Thisis a secondary type of instrument,
requiring standardization by comparison with some other radiation-measuring instru-
ment whose constants can be determined. Such an assumed standard was con-
structed here by inclosing the cylindrical bulb of a mercury thermometer in a flat
round box of very thin copper filled with mercury, nickeled on the back and sides,
blackened with platinum deposit in front, and situated in the center of a much larger
hollow, thick-walled wooden sphere coated with bright tin foil within, and provided
with a measured aperture opposite the front of the copper box, to which the solar
beam was led through a diaphragmed blackened tube. Such an instrument is essen-
tially the pyrheliometer of Pouillet, as advantageously modified by Tyndall by the
employment of mercury instead of water, but is rendered still more quick in its action
by the use of copper instead of the iron employed by Tyndall, and partakes somewhat
of the character of a perfect absorber or ‘‘black body,’’ because inclosed in the tin-
foil coated hollow sphere. The water equivalent of the instrument was determined
by repeated calorimetric measurements. In use it has apparently worked perfectly,
responding so quickly to the heating of the solar rays that the rise of temperature in
the first 20 seconds after exposure is within two or three hundredths of a degree as
great as in the following 20-second intervals.

Nevertheless there is a doubt as to the accuracy of this and, as 1 think, of all
instruments thus far used to measure the total solar radiation, from the fact that they
one and all receive the beam upon a front surface, which must necessarily get warmer
than the rear portion of the instrument, where the rise of temperature is observed,
and hence must lose a portion of the heat by a greater convection and radiation than
that which takes place after insolation has ceased. Thusa portion of the heat always
escapes measurement, and there is no ready way of knowing what its amount is. It
has been sought to devise here some type of standard pyrheliometer to which this
objection does not apply, and it is believed that such an instrument has been found,
although its construction is not yet complete. In principle it depends on receiving
the radiations within a hollow chamber or ‘‘ black body”’ and carrying away the
heat by a continuous current of liquid, and the instrument, if successful, can be
employed as a continuous self-recording pyrheliometer.

Meanwhile repeated comparisons have made it sure that both the Crova actinom-
eterand the mercury pyrheliometer give readings proportional to the solar radiation,
though there still remains some doubt as to the absolute magnitudes. Accordingly
one or both of these instruments have been read on days when the transmission of
the air has been determined, and these two kinds of data have been employed to
compute the solar constant of radiation or rate of receipt of solar radiation outside
the earth’s atmosphere.

THE SOLAR CONSTANT.

This important quantity has been studied by the method you have devised and
described in the report of the Mount Whitney Expedition, and in a recent article in
the Astrophysical Journal for March, 1903. As employed here the method consists
in producing bolographs of the solar spectrum, correcting the form of these for instru-
mental absorption, and again for atmospheric absorption, and then multiplying the
rate of receipt of solar radiation at the earth’s surface, as measured by the actinome-
ter, by the ratio of the areas included under the bolographic curves, corrected for
atmospheric absorption and uncorrected, respectively.

The work here has been more in the way of developing the method of study and
obtaining experience in its use than in the expectation of measuring with certainty
the solar constant itself, for (as you have elsewhere observed), whereas it is in other
kinds of observation almost a certainty that the mean of a series of observations is
more trustworthy than any single one, here a single observation made without inter-

sm 1903——6
82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vening absorption would outweigh any number requiring correction for atmospheric
absorption, and the values observed through smallest air masses are the most trust-
worthy. It follows that values obtained ata low altitude like that of Washington are
necessarily too small, owing to the difficulty of allowing with accuracy for the absorp-
tion of the great thickness of air above the observer.

There has been incorporated in the act appropriating for the support of the Astro-
physical Observatory during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904, a provision for
high-altitude observations. In anticipation it may be said that apparatus for that
purpose has been ordered. ;

Although, therefore, uncertainty attaches to the actual values determined here
and to be given below, still ifis probable that they are relatively comparable among
themselyes when we consider the apparent accuracy both of the observations and
the exponential formula used in reducing them, as illustrated in Plate VI, and the
fact that the application of coefficients of atmospheric transmission determined simi-
larly would practically obliterate the great selective absorption bands in computing
the form of the solar energy curve outside the atmosphere.

REDUCED OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOLAR RADIATION CONSTANT.

In the following table will be found such computations of the solar constant as
were made up to July 1, 1903. The bolographs on which they depend extend for
the most part from 0.375 se to 2.5 4, and thus include practically all the solar radia-
tion which reaches the earth’s surface.

A correction of about 1 per cent has been added, representing the best estimate
which could be made of the excess of energy beyond these limits outside the earth’s
atmosphere. All the results depend on the constant of the pyrheliometer, and may
therefore be subject to multiplication by a constant factor to be subsequently deter-
mined. Comparing the values obtained with those which you have given in the
Mount Whitney report of 3 calories, it will be seen that they are about 25 per cent
smaller, and that the difference does not appear to depend on the transmission
coefficients, but rather seems chiefly due to a difference in actinometry.

Thus you have stated the usual actinometer reading at Allegheny, Pa., for clear
blue sky at 1.7 calories,” while the very highest value obtained here is 1.44 calories.
Much lower yalues are reported from recent observations of Mr. Kimball, of the
United States Weather Bureau, at Asheville, N. C., and at Washington, so that on
the whole the question of absolute actinometry seems a very open one.

Turning next to the relative values of the solar constant, it is seen that there is
generally good agreement of the results prior to March 26, 1908, and that since that
date there has been a decrease of about 10 per cent in the computed constant. No
reason for this is known, as some of the best observations were before and others
since March 25, those of February 19, March 25, March 26, and April 29 being con-
sidered to have most weight. February 25 was a most extraordinary day as regards
absence of water yapor absorption. Never since bolographs have been taken here
have the great infra-red water-vapor bands @ Y Q been observed so feeble as on
February 19.

« The observations of October, 1902, which reached only to 0.48u, have been cor-
rected by means of later work and are therefore of less weight.

THE FORM OF THE SOLAR-ENERGY CURVE OUTSIDE THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE INFERRED
TEMPERATURE OF THE SUN.

Plate VII includes a number of curves which represent on the normal wave-length
scale the distribution of energy in the solar spectrum outside the earth’s atmosphere.
They are computed from prismatic energy curves by aid of the coefficients of instru-
mental and atmospheric absorption and the known dispersion of the prism. It will
be seen that these recent studies indicate the position of the maximum ordinate at a
wave length of about 0.49 y, or between green and blue of the spectrum, and that
there is a fairly close agreement between the different days’ work. The principal
differences occur in the blue and violet spectrum, and are to some extent caused by
the rapid deterioration of the reflecting power of the silvered surfaces in this region,
which renders very frequent measurements of instrumental absorption necessary, and
even then hardly sufficient.

Paschen and gthers have established an empirical equation connecting the absolute
temperature 7’ with the wave length of maximum energy A,,,,,. which is as follows:

max

XA T=CONSTANT.

marx

The constant in this equation has been determined by Paschen, Lummer,
Pringsheim, and others, to be about 2,900 for an ‘‘absolutely black body,’’ or per-
fect radiator, and ranging as low as about 2,600 for bright platinum. Using the
former value, we may say that it appears that the radiation of the solar beam outside
the earth’s atmosphere has its maximum energy at the same wave length as a perfect
radiator of the assumed temperature of 5,920° absolute.

SUMMARY.

The operations of the year have consisted chiefly: First, in the provision and suc-
cessful installation of a horizontal reflecting telescope of 20 inches aperture and 140
84 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

feet focus, fed by a new form of two-mirror coelostat, and employed with a provision
for ‘“‘churning”’ the air on the path of the beam. This instrumental equipment is to
be used for bolographic study of the solar image, and especially sun-spot energy
spectra and the absorption of the solar envelope. Second, in the continuation, with
improved bolographic apparatus, of studies of the solar-energy spectrum and the
absorption of radiation in the atmosphere.

As the most notable result of the studies of atmospheric absorption, it appears that
the average transmission of the air of Washington for all wave lengths for the best
days of 1902-3 has been as much as 10 per cent less than for the best days of 1901-2,
while the decrease of transparency in the violet is very much greater. There is no
evidence that this remarkable decrease is due to water vapor. Indeed, it has been
well observed on the very driest days.

Inquiries have been made of the Observatory as to whether the blight of the wheat
and barley crops could be attributed to any decrease in the ultraviolet radiation of
the sun, but the Observatory was able only to state the fact that such a decrease had
been observed.

It is probable that something like this affected the actinometric observations
recorded by Crova in the years following the great eruption of Krakatoa, though
whether the smaller one of Mont Pelee can be associated with it is uncertain. There
is no evidence yet obtainable of how general this absorption is at different parts of
the globe, but it is, perhaps, the most notable single result of our- past year’s experi-
ments, and is eminently in the line of the work you have anticipated for the Astro-
physical Observatory, in furnishing data of importanée to the national interests in
agriculture, and in estimating the influences which may affect past and coming
harvests.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN.

Str: I have the honor to present the report on the operations of the library of the
Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903.

In the following table is shown the number of volumes, parts of volumes, pam-
phlets, and charts recorded in the accession books of the Smithsonian deposit, Library
of Congress:

The accession numbers run from 445524 to 452465.

A small number of these publications are assigned temporarily to the library here
for the use of the staff of the Institution and Museum, the greater quantity being
sent direct to the Library of Congress.

These sendings required about 200 boxes and 20 bags and packages, and are esti-
mated to have amounted to the equivalent of 9,200 octavo volumes. The publi-
cations sent in this way -are independent of those transmitted by the Bureau of
International Exchanges, and do not include public documents presented to the
Smithsonian Institution, which are sent to the Library of Congress without stamping,
credit there being given to the country sending.

For several years prior to the removal of the Library of Congress to its new build-
ing a large number of the scientific series bearing upon the work of the Institution
were retained, owing to the crowded condition of the Library of Congress in its old
quarters at the Capitol. During the past year it has been found possible to get these
out, have them taken off the Museum record, and checked on the accession book
and sent to the Library of Congress. These sets, series, and volumes were forwarded
in 167 boxes, estimated to contain about 6,680 octavo volumes, making a total sending
to the Library of Congress for the year of about 15,880 volumes.

The libraries of the Secretary, Office, and Astrophysical Observatory have received
during the year 409 volumes, pamphlets, and charts and 1,625 parts of volumes,
making a total of 2,034, and a grand total, including books for the Smithsonian
deposit, of 29,347. The serial publications entered on the card catalogue number
24,630. :

The universities at the following places have sent inaugural dissertations and aca-
demic publications:

Basel. Kazan. Toronto,
Berlin. Konigsberg. Toulouse.

Helsingfors. Rostock.

Owing to the large number of series and parts of sets culled from the Museum
library and sent to the Library of Congress for the Smithsonian deposit during the
year the Office has been occupied with the checking off and making memoranda for
the completing of these sets. While this has taken a great deal of time, the policy
carried on from year to year of increasing the library by exchange has been con-
tinued, and though, for the above reason, there is quite a decrease in the number of
letters written for new exchanges and for completing series already in the library,
the total reached 714. Two hundred and sixty-five periodicals were added to the
receipts and 239 defective series were either completed or partly completed, depend-
ing upon the publisher’s ability to supply the numbers needed. Where certain
numbers of periodicals are reported as missing, a request that they be supplied is
made on a postal card and corresponding cards are sent in acknowledgment of
receipts. During the year 654 numbers were asked for and 424 supplied.

The books in the reference room containing the proceedings and transactions of
the learned societies have been taken from the shelves and rearranged in more sys-
tematic order. These books have been consulted by members of the staff of the
Institution as well as by others. In the reading room the additional shelving has
allowed a better arrangement of the bound volumes of periodicals. Two thousand
seven hundred and forty-seven periodicals were taken out for consultation. No
additional libraries have been added to the list and those maintained in the Institu-
tion are the Secretary’s library, Office library, and the Employee’s library. The
sectional libraries remain as before, i. e., AZrodromics, International Exchange, and
Law Reference.

The sectional library of the Astrophysical Observatory was given a thorough over-
hauling and many volumes belonging to the Smithsonian deposit not being needed
for use there were sent to the Library of Congress. As special help was provided,
many of the missing parts of publications were noted and ordered, and at the close
of the year most of these had been received. The number of volumes bound
was 184.

The section of the library devoted to books of a popular nature for the use of the
employees has been used more than ever. The success of the sending of a number
of books to the Zoological Park once a month has more than repaid the trouble taken,
and 575 books were sent out in the course of the year. There are now 1,413 volumes
on the shelves of the hbrary and 2,946 books were borrowed during the year; 100
magazines were bound and 43 new books added to the collection. :

In the reading room, cataloguing room, and entry to the employees’ lhbrary open
shelving has been put up, in addition to that which was already in these places,
giving room for expanding and for a better arrangement of the collections of books.

Gen. John Watts de Peyster has continued to add to his already large collection of
books and pamphlets relating to Napoleon Bonaparte, and through his munificence
many rare yolumes have come to enrich the library of the Smithsonian Institution.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87
Besides these books, a collection of works on gypsies, a collection of dictionaries and
encyclopedias, together with several portraits, pictures, and paintings are included
in his gifts. Many of the dictionaries and encyclopedias are very rare and can not
now be duplicated.

At the close of last year, the extension of the Parthenon frieze in the art room was
under consideration, and during August and September very good casts of this frieze
of about the right height were obtained and placed upon the walls.

The collection of books on art and kindred subjects now in the art room has
received a valuable addition from Dr. E. A. Schwarz, who presented a number of art
publications. It is hoped that in the near future time will be found for the card
cataloguing of this collection, as well as many other works which are already there.

As Congress failed to appropriate money for the representation of the United States
on the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Smithsonian Institution
again carried on the work, though with a sum quite insufficient for the needs and
the necessary help. A larger amount has been allotted for the coming year, which
will enable the Institution to do the work more thoroughly, and will also make it
possible to fill in the gaps left in the reference to the literature of 1901. The follow-
ing references were furnished to the central bureau:

The following volumes of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature of
1901 have been received and distributed: Botany, Part 1; Chemistry, Part I;
Mechanics; Physics, Part]; Meteorology; Physiology, Part 1; Mathematics; Astron-
omy; Bacteriology; Physics, Part Il; Mineralogy; Geology; Geography; and List of
Journals.

The subscription price for these volumes represent a total of $3,926.82. Out of
this sum $2,556.52 had been received up to June 30, 1903.

The United States National Museum library has been increased during the past
year by two important gifts—the E. A. Sciwarz collection of books, relating to Amer-
ican Coleoptera, and the W. H. Dall collection of books, bearing on recent and fossil
mollusks. The Schwarz Library is one that was built up by Doctor Schwarz and
G. G. Hubbard while carrying on their studies, and is intended to form an accessory
to their collection of insects which was presented to the Museum some years ago.

Doctor Dall, as a collaborator in the Museum, has brought together, in connection
with his studies on the collection of mollusks in the United States National Museum,
a collection of books which comprises about 1,600 bound volumes and about 2,000
pamphlets. In connection with this library Doctor Dall also presents a card cata-
logue covering the literature of Conchology, recent and fossil, up to about 1860. He
purchased from the executors of Mons. G. P. Deshayes, paleontologist, the original
cards, numbering about 190,000. Doctor Dall obtained this catalogue some twenty-
five years ago, and during the time it was in his possession he added materially to the
number of cards relating to the genera of mollusks, though the series relating to
species remains much as Monsieur Deshayes left it.

During the latter part of last summer the United States National Museum Library
was closed to the public for the purpose of rearranging the books and sorting many
into their proper place and series. This had been impossible during the last few
8&8 : REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

years, owing to tne crowded condition; but within the past year the additional gal-
leries provided have been turned over, thus giving the space needed for this pur-
pose. All the shelves have been gone over, the books taken down and placed in
the classification, making them more accessible, and a large number belonging to
the Smithsonian deposit were separated from the Museum books and sent over
to the Smithsonian Institution for checking preparatory to their being transmitted
to the Library of Congress. ~

Three special collections of books in the library have been provided with book-
plates—i. e., the Goode Library, the Schwarz Library, and the Dall Library.

The Museum library now contains 19,161 bound yolumes and 32,063 unbound
papers. The additions during the year consisted of 3,161 books, 3,260 pamphlets,
and 303 parts of volumes. There were catalogued 916 books, of which 76 belonged
to the Smithsonian deposit; 1,571 pamphlets, of which 18 belonged to the Smith-
sonian deposit, and 9,838 parts of periodicals, of which 2,274 belonged to the
Smithsonian deposit.

Three thousand three hundred and sixteen cards were added to the Authors’
Catalogue. These numbers do not include 4,614 cards for books and pamphlets
recatalogued, and also do not include any of the books in the Dall library, but do
include a number of those in the Schwarz library.

The number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed from the general
library amounted to 23,583, including 4,833 withdrawn for assignment to the
sectional libraries.

There has been no change in the sectional libraries established in the Museum,
and they are as follows:

SMUETHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1903.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discoy-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs. illustrating the more remark-
able and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year L888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1903.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. ¢

By N. 8. SHALER,

Professor, Harvard University.

Although the moon has been the most studied of all celestial objects,
few persons except astronomers have a clear idea of even the general
results which have been derived from the vast body of observations
that have been made upon it. For this reason it appears desirable to
preface the account of the special inquiries which are set forth in the
following pages by a statement of what is known concerning this near-
est neighbor of our earth. This account will necessarily be limited to
the facts which can be set forth in other than mathematical form:
fortunately these include all that the reader needs to have in mind in
order to obtain a fairly clear understanding of the questions which are
to be discussed.

The history of primitive astronomy shows that the moon, of all
celestial objects, from the beginning of man’s intellectual development
has been the most closely observed. Although the sun was doubtless
recognized by the lowliest man as the most important feature of the
heavens, as the giver of life, the conditions under which it is seen,
especially its blinding light, long made any extended study of it
impossible. So, except for the very evident changes of its course
across the sky and the consequent succession of the seasons, little was
known of the solar center two hundred years ago, and, save its approx-
imate distance from the earth, its mass, and its general relations to the
planets, not much knowledge of it was gained until the last century.
On the other hand, the moon, because of its nearness, being only about
one four-hundredth part as:‘remote from the earth as the sun, has in a
noteworthy way entered into the records of men. Its relatively short
period of change and the very pronounced character of its alterations
made it the first index of time beyond the round of the day. It is
evident, indeed, that as soon as men began to reckon time they used
the lunar month to make their tally, rather than that of the solar year.

104 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON.

Moreover, the surface of the moon reveals much to the naked eye,
not clearly, but sufficiently well to afford the basis for speculation and
to tempt the imagination to create there a world like our own. It is
therefore not surprising that a host of myths concerning the nature
of our satellite grew up in the days before the telescope. It is inter-
esting to note the fact that many of these myths have not only become
fixed in the minds of uninstructed people, but they have had a remark-
able influence upon modern astronomers, limiting their capacity to
interpret what their instruments clearly reveal to them. At every
stage in the advance of selenography we note the curious persistency
of the endeavor not only to interpret the lunar features by the terres-
trial, but to warp the observed facts into accord with those seen on
the earth. There is perhaps no better instance of the extent to which
prepossessions and prejudices may affect the judgment of the most
conscientious observer, blinding him to evident truth, than the history
of lunar inquiries affords.

The story of the physical conditions of the moon had best be begun
by noting that the relation of our satellite to a larger sphere is not
exceptional, but the most characteristic of all the relations of one stel-
lar body to another. Of the planets in the solar system, all save the
two nearest to the sun, Mercury and Venus, have one or more smaller
spheres circling about them. The relation of the sun to the several
planets in a larger way repeats this plan of grouping lesser about
greater orbs.

It is generally believed by astronomers that the celestial spheres
have been formed by a process of condensation, due to gravitation, of
matter which was originally widely diffused; that our solar system,
before it was organized into the sun and lesser bodies, was in the form
of a diffused nebulous mass of spheroidal form which extended beyond
the orbit of the outermost planet. As this matter gathered toward
the center, the material now in each of the planets and its satellites
parted from the parent body, probably at first in the form of a nebu-
lous ring, or spiral, which in time broke and gathered into a spheroidal
mass. In that detached portion of the parent nebula the process of
concentration was repeated, with the result that satellites, or, as we
may term them, secondary planets, were formed substantially as the
greater spheres were set off from the sun. There are many questions
and doubts concerning the details of this nebular theory, but that the
evolution of our solar system, and probably of all stellar systems, took
place in substantially the manner indicated appears to be eminently
probable; it is, indeed, fairly well established by what we know of the
distant nebule and by the rings of Saturn, which apparently contain
the material which normally should have formed one or more of its
satellites, but which for some unknown reason have remained
unbroken.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 105

It is not certain at just what stage in the concentration of a nebula, a
planet or a satellite may be set off from the parent body; nor can the
present distance of the satellite from the main sphere be assumed as
that at which the parting took place. It is possible that the concen-
tration of the parent body had gone so far that the diffused or nebu-
lous stage of its materials had been passed by and the more advanced
stage of igneous fluidity entered on. It is, however, more likely that
in all cases the separation occurred while the particles of matter were
divided as they are in a gas or vapor. As soon as the two spheres are
separated from one another, and so long as they remain in any meas-
ure fluid, the difference in their gravitative attraction on the nearer
and more remote part of their masses induces tides, and the effect of
these tidal movements, as has been shown by Prof. George Darwin, is
necessarily to impel the two bodies farther apart. It seems certain
that before the earth and the moon became essentially rigid, as they
now are, the effect of these tides in driving them apart must have been
great enough to account for a considerable part of the interval which
now separates them.

In the present condition of the moon it is a sphere having a com-
puted diameter of 2,159.6 miles and its mean distance from the earth
238,818 miles. So far as has been determined the moon exhibits no
trace of flattening at the poles, such as characterizes the earth, unless,
as is possible, there are irregularities of figure on the unseen part of
the sphere. It is essentially globular inform. The fact that the moon
is not flattened at its poles probably indicates that if it once rotated
in the manner of the planet it ceased to do so before it became solid.

The measure of density of the moon—i. e., the proportion of its
weight to its bulk—is only about six-tenths that of the earth. While
the earth’s mean density is nearly 5.7 times that of water, that of the
moon is about 3.5 times as great. ‘Thus the total gravitative force of
the lunar mass is to be reckoned as only about one eighty-first of that
of our planet.

As the moon revolves on its polar axis but once in about a month,
and at a rate that tends to keep the same part of its surface turned
toward the earth, we should, but for the phenomenon of librations,
see no more than one-half of its superficial area. Owing, however, to
this feature, which is due to certain complications of the moon’s
exceedingly varied movements, the satellite in effect sways in relation
to the earth so that at certain times we see farther to the east and at
others farther to the west of its center, and in the succession of these
movements we are able to behold somewhat more than one-half the
total area—in fact, about six-tenths of it. It is impossible to set forth
in this writing the reasons for the librations of the moon, as the mat-
ter can not be explained without giving in mathematical form a full

106 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON.

account of the motion of our satellite, which is one of the most com-
plicated of astronomical problems. 4

As noted below, there is some accessible information going to show
that even beyond the extreme field revealed by the librations the sur-
face of the moon has the same character as that which is visible.
Thus we find that up to the limits of the visible part there is no sign
of change in the nature of the surface. It is therefore reasonable to
conclude that the same characteristics extend for some distance beyond
the limits of vision. Wealso note on the verge of the unseen field the
hither margins of certain ring-shaped structures, the so-called volea-
noes, evidently of large size, so that it is fair to conclude that these
features are continued on the unseen part. Moreover, there are some
light-colored bands, such as on this side of the moon always radiate
from crater-like pits, which apparently come over from such centers
on the unseen part. These several facts, taken together, make it
eminently probable that the unseen four-tenths of the lunar surface in
no essential way differs from that we observe. It is, indeed, altogether
likely that we see every type of structure that exists on the moon, and
that a view of its whole area would add nothing essentially new to our
knowledge of the sphere.

Seen by persons of ordinarily good vision, even at a distance of
about 240,000 miles, the moon reveals much of its surface shape, struc-
ture, and color; it is evident that the color varies greatly from very
bright areas to those which are relatively dark, that the latter are
somewhat less in total extent than the former, and that they are dis-
posed ina general way across the northern hemisphere.’ Persons of
more than usually good vision may, under favorable conditions, see on
the edge of the illuminated area the ragged line of the sunlight, which
indicates that the surface is very irregular, the high points coming
into the day before the lower are illuminated. Such persons at time
of full moon can also note, though faintly, some of the bright bands
which, radiating from certain crater-like pits, extend for great distances
over the surface. So, too, they may see at the first stage of the new
and the last of the old moon, the light from the sunlit earth slightly
illuminating the dark part of the lunar sphere, or, as it is often termed,
the old moon in the arms of the new.

With the best modern telescopes under the most suitable conditions
of observation the moon is seen as it would be by the unaided eye if

«An excellent nonmathematical presentation of the question, which affords a
sufficient idea of it, may be found in The Moon, by Richard A. Proctor, pp. 117
et seq., D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1878.

>Itis well to note the fact that in a celestial telescope objects are seen in reverse
position, or ‘‘upside down.’’ For convenience they are usually so depicted on maps
and pictures of the moon; the north pole at the bottom, and the east where it is cus-
tomary to place the west on terrestrial maps.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 107

it were not more than about 40 miles from the observer. The condi-
tions of this seeing are much more favorable than those under which
we behold a range of terrestrial mountains at that distance, for the
reason that the air, and especially the moisture, in our atmosphere
hinders and confuses the light, and there is several times as much of
this obstruction encountered in a distance of 40 miles along the earth’s
surface as there is in looking vertically upward.

Seen with the greater telescopes, the surface of the moon may reveal
to able observers, in the rare moments of the best seeing, circular
objects, such as pits, which are perhaps not more than 500 feet in
diameter. Elevations of much less height may be detected by their
shadows, which, because there is no trace of an atmosphere on the
moon, are extraordinarily sharp, the line between the dark and light
being as distinct as though drawn by aruler. Elongate objects, such
as rifts or crevices in the surface, because of their length, may be vis-
ible even when they are only a few score feet in width, for the same
reason that while a black dot on a wall may not make any impression
on the eye, a line no wider than the dot can be readily perceived.
Owing to these conditions, the surface of the moon has revealed many
of its features to us, perhaps about as well as we could discern them
by the naked eye if the sphere were no more than 20 miles away.

Separated from all theories and prepossessions, the most important
points which have been ascertained as to the condition of the moon’s
surface are as follows:

The surface differs from that of the earth in the fact that it lacks
the envelopes of air and water. That there is no air is indicated by
the feature above noted—that there is no diffusion of the sunlight, the
shadows being absolutely black and with perfectly clean-cut edges.
It is also shown by the fact that when a star is occulted or shut out by
the dise of the moon it disappears suddenly without its light being
displaced, as it would be by refraction if there were any sensible
amount of air in the line of its rays. This evidence affords proof that
if there is any air at all on the moon’s surface it is probably less in
amount than remains in the nearest approach to a vacuum we can
produce by means of an air pump. Like proof of the airless nature
of the moon is afforded by the spectroscope applied to the study of
the light of an occulting star or that of the sun as it is becoming
eclipsed by the moon. In fact, a great body of evidence goes to show
that there is no air whatever on the lunar surface.

The evidence of lack of water at the present time on the surface of
the moon appears to be as complete as that which shows the lack of an
atmosphere. In the first place, there are evidently no seas or even
lakes of discernible size. There are clearly no rivers. If such fea-
tures existed, the reflection of the sun from their surfaces would make
108 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON.

them exceedingly conspicuous on the dark background of the moon,
which for all its apparent brightness is really as dark as the more
somber-hued rocks of the earth’s surface when lit by the sun. More-
over, even were water present, without an atmosphere there could be
no such circulation as takes place on the earth, upward to clouds and
thence downward by the rain and streams to the ocean. Clouds can
not exist unless there be an atmosphere in which they can float, and
even if there be an air of exceeding tenuity on the moon, it is surely
insufficient to support a trace of clouds. Some distinguished astrono-
mers have thought to discern samething floating of a cloud-like
nature, but these observations, though exceedingly interesting, are
not sufficiently verified to have much weight against the body of
well-observed facts that shows the moon to be essentially waterless.

The well-established absence of both air and water in any such
quantities as is necessary to maintain organic life appears to exclude
the possibility of there being any such life as that of plants and ani-
mals on the lunar surface. It may be stated that very few astronomers
are now inclined to believe that the moon can possibly be the abode of
living forms.

Being without an effective atmosphere, for the possible but unproved
remnant that may exist there would be quite ineffective, the moon
lacks the defense against radiation of heat which the air affords the
earth. Therefore in the long lunar night the outflow of heat must
bring the temperature of the darkened part to near that of the celestial
spaces, certainly to some hundred degrees below Fahrenheit zero.
Even in the long day this lack of air and consequent easy radiation
must prevent any considerable warming of the surface. The temper-
ature of the moon has been made the matter of numerous experiments.
These, for various reasons, have not proved very effective. The most
trustworthy, the series undertaken by 5S. P. Langley, indicate that at
no time does the heat attain to that of melting ice.

Turning now to the shape and structure of the moon’s crust, we
observe that it differs much from that of the earth. Considering first
the more general features, we note that there are none of those broad
ridges and furrows—the continents and the sea basins. A portion of
the surface, mainly in the northern hemisphere, is occupied by wide
plains, which in their general shape are more nearly level than any
equally extensive areas of the land, or, so far as we know, of the ocean
floor of the earth, though they are beset with very many slight irregu-
larities. These areas of rough, dark-hued plains are the seas or maria
of selenographers, so termed because of old they were, from their rela-
tively level nature, supposed to be areas of water. These maria occupy
about one-third of the visible surface. Their height is somewhat less
than that of the crust outside of theirarea. The remaining portion of
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. 109

the moon is extremely rugged. It is evident that the average declivity
of the slopes is far greater than on the earth. This is apparent in all
the features made visible by the telescope, and it likely extends to
others too minute to be seen by the most powerful instruments.
Zillner, by a very ingenious computation based on the amount of
sunlight reflected, estimates that the average angle of the lunar surface
to its horizon is 52 degrees. Though we have no such basis for reck-
oning the average slope of the lands and sea bottoms of the earth, it
is eminently probable that it does not amount to more than a tenth of
that declivity. This difference, as well as many others, is probably
due to the lack on the moon of the work of water, which so effectively
breaks down the steeps of the earth, tending ever to bring the surface
to a uniform level.

The most notable feature on the lunar surface is the existence of
exceedingly numerous pits, generally with ring-like walls about them,
which slope very steeply to a central cavity and more gently toward
the surrounding country. These pits vary greatly in size; the largest
are more than a hundred miles in diameter, while the smallest discerni-
ble are less than a half mile across. The number increases as the size
diminishes; there are many thousands of them, so small that they are
revealed only when sought for with the most powerful telescopes and
with the best seeing. In all these pits, except those of the smallest
size, and possibly in these also, there is within the ring wall and at a
considerable though variable depth below its summita nearly flat floor,
which often has a central pit of small size or in its place a steep, rude
cone. When this plain is more than 20 miles in diameter, and with
increasing numbers as the floor is wider, there are generally other
irregularly scattered pits and cones. Thus in the case of Plato, a ring
about 60 miles in diameter, there are some scores of these lesser pits.
On the interior of the ring walls of the pits over 10 miles in diameter
there are usually more or less distinct terraces, which suggest, if they
do not clearly indicate, that the material now forming the solid floors
they inclose was once fluid and stood at greater heights in the pit than
that at which it became permanently frozen. It is, indeed, tolerably
certain that the last movement of this material of the floors was one
of interrupted subsidence from an originally greater elevation on the
outside of the ring wall, which is commonly of irregular height, with
many peaks. There are sometimes tongues or protrusions of the sub-
stance which forms the ring, as if it had flowed a short distance and
then had cooled with steep slopes.

The foregoing account of the pits on the lunar surface suggests to
the reader that these features are volcanoes. That view of their nature
was taken by the astronomers who first saw them with the telescope
and has been generally held by their successors. That they are in
110 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON.

some way, and rather nearly, related to the volcanic vents of the earth
appears certain. We have now to note the following peculiar condi-
tions of these pits. First, that they exist in varying proportion, with
no evident law of distribution, all over the visible area of the moon.
Next, that in many instances they intersect each other, showing that
they were not all formed at the same time, but in succession; that the
larger of them are not found on the maria, but on the upland and
apparently the older parts of the surface; and that the evidence from
the intersections clearly shows that the greater of these structures are
prevailingly the elder and that in general the smallest were the latest
formed. In other words, whatever was the nature of the action
involved in the production of these curious structures, its energy
diminished with time, until in the end it could no longer break the
crust.

All over the surface of the moon, outside of the maria, in the regions
not occupied by the voleano-like structures, we find an exceedingly
irregular surface, consisting usually of rude excrescences with no dis-
tinct arrangement, which may attain the height of many thousand feet.
These, when large, have been termed mountains, though they are
very unlike any on the earth in their lack of the features due to
erosion, as well as in the general absence of order in their association.
Elevations of this steep, lumpy form are common on all parts of the
moon. Outside of the maria they are seen at their best in the region
near the north pole, where a large field thus beset is termed the Alps.
From the largest of these elevations a series of like forms can be made
of smaller and smaller size until they become too minute to be revealed
by the telescope; as they decrease in height they tend to become more
regular in shape, very often taking on a dome-like aspect. The only
terrestrial elevations at all resembling these lunar reliefs are certain
‘arely occurring masses of trachytic lava, which appear to have been
spewed out through crevices in a semifluid state, and to have been so
rapidly hardened in cooling that the slopes of the solidified rock
remained very steep. The only reliefs on the moon that remind the
geologist of true mountains are certain low ridges on the surfaces of
the maria.

The surface of the moon exhibits a very great number of fissures or
rents which, when widely opened, are termed valleys, and when nar-
row, rills. Both these names were given because these grooves were
supposed to have been the result of erosion due to flowing water.
The valleys are frequently broad, in the case of that known as the
** Alpine Valley,” at certain places several miles in width; they are steep
walled, and sometimes a mile or more in depth; their bottoms, when
distinctly visible, are seen to be beset with crater-like pits, and show
in no instance a trace of water work, which necessarily excavates
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. LEY

smooth descending floors such as we find in terrestrial valleys. The
rills are narrow crevices, often so narrow that their bottoms can not
be seen; they frequently branch, and in some instances are continued
as branching cracks for 100 miles or more. The characteristic rills are
far more abundant than the valleys, there being many scores already
described; the slighter are evidently the more numerous; a catalogue
of those visible in the best telescopes would probably amount to several
thousand. (See plates v1, Ix, Xx.)

It is a noteworthy fact that in the case of the rills, and in great
measure also in the valleys, the two sides of the fissure correspond so
that if brought together the rent would be closed. This indicates that
they are essentially cracks which have opened by their walls drawing
apart. Curiously enough, as compared with rents in the earth’s crust,
there is little trace of a change of level of the two sides of these rills—
only in one instance is there such a displacement well made out, that
known as the Straight Wall, where one side of the break is several hun-
dred feet above the other. (See plate 1x.)

In the region outside of the maria much of the general surface of
the moon between the numerous crater-like openings appears in the
best seeing with powerful telescopes to be beset with minute pits, often
so close together that their limits are so far confused that it appears
as honeycombed, or, rather, as a mass of furnace slag full of holes if
greatly magnified, through which the gases developed in melting the
mass escaped. (See plate v.)

Perhaps the most exceptional feature of the lunar surface, as com-
pared with that of the earth, is found in the numerous systems of
radiating light bands, in all about thirty in number, which diverge
from patches of the same hue about certain of the crater-like pits.
These bands of light-colored material are generally narrow, not more
than a few miles in width; they extend for great distances, certain of
them being over 1,000 miles in length, one of them attaining to 1,700
miles in linear extent. In one instance at least, in the crater named
Saussure, a band which intersects the pit may be seen crossing its
floor, and less distinctly, yet clearly enough, it appears on the steep
inside walls of the cavity. In no well-observed case do these radiating
streaks of light-colored material coincide with the before-mentioned
splits or rifts. Yet the assemblage of facts, though the observations
and the theories based upon them are very discrepant, lead us to
believe that they are in the nature of stains or sheets of matter on the
surface of the sphere, or perhaps in the mass of the crust. At some
points the rays of one system cross those of another in a manner that
indicates that the one is of later formation than the other. (See plates
Wi, ViL,, VIII)
LIZ GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON.

Perhaps the most puzzling feature of the radiating streaks, where
everything is perplexing, is found in the way they come into view and
disappear in each Junar period. When the surface is illuminated by
the very oblique rays of the sun they are quite invisible; as the lunar
day advances they become faintly discernible, but are only seen in
perfect clearness near the full moon, The reason for this peculiar
appearance of these light bands under a high sun has been a matter
of much conjecture; it is the subject of discussion in a later chapter
of this memoir, where it is shown that inasmuch as these bands appear
when the earth light falls upon the moon at a high angle, the effect
must be due to the angle of incidence of the rays on the shining sur-
faces. It should be noted that the light bands in most instances
diverge from more or less broad fields of light color about the crater-
like pits, fields which have the same habit of glowing under a high
illumination; in fact, a large part of the surface of the moon, perhaps
near one-tenth of its visible area, becomes thus relatively brilliant at
full moon, though it lacks that quality at the earlier and later stages
of the lunar day.

In the above-considered statement concerning the visible phenomena
of the moon no account is taken of a great variety of obscure features
which, though easily seen with fairly good instruments, have received
slight attention from selenographers. As can readily be imagined,
observers find it difficult to discern dimly seen features which can not
be classed in any group of terrestrial objects. Whosoever will nar-
rowly inspect any part of the lunar surface, noting everything that
meets his eye, will find that he observes much that can not be explained
by what is seen on the earth. It is evident, indeed, that while in the
earlier stages of development this satellite in good part followed the
series of changes undergone by its planet there came a stage in which
it ceased to continue the process of evolution that the parent body has
undergone. The reason for this arrest in development appears to have
been the essential if not complete absence of an atmosphere and of
water.

The difference in height between the lowest and highest points on
the lunar surface is not determined. To the most accented reliefs,
those of the higher crater walls, elevations of more than 25,000 feet
have been assigned; it is, however, to be noted that all these deter-
minations are made from the length of the shadows cast by the emi-
nences, with no effective means of correcting for certain errors
incidental to this method. It may be assumed as tolerably certain
that a number of these elevations have their summits at least 20,000
feet above their bases, and that a few are yet higher. We do not
know how much lower than the ground about these elevations are the
lowest parts of the moon. My own observations incline me to the
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON. TS

opinion that the difference may well amount to as much as 10,000 feet,
so that the total relief of the moon may amount to somewhere between
30,000 and 40,000 feet. That of the earth from the deepest part of
the oceans to the highest mountain summits is probably between
55,000 and 60,000 feet; so that notwithstanding the lack of erosion
and sedimentation which in the earth continually tends to diminish
the difference between the sea-floor and land areas, the surface of
the satellite has a much less range of elevation than the planet. If the
forces which have built the mountains and continents of the earth had
operated without the erosive action of water, there is little doubt that
the difference in height between the highest and lowest parts would
now be many times as great as it is on the moon.

[In accordance with the usage of selenographers, the plates are printed in the
reversed order in which they appear in a celestial telescope. The top of each is the
south, the bottom the north, the right-hand the east, and the left the west. ]

In PJ. I the most noteworthy features are the maria of the western half of the
visible portion of the sphere. The rudely circular form of these fields is well shown,
also the fact that none of them extend to the margin or ‘‘limb”’ of the moon. The
bright, slightly curved ridge in the lower half of the picture facing the partly illu-
minated mare—the Mare Imbrium—is the Apennines; the large vulcanoid at its
southern end is Eratosthenes. The larger pit in the ocean opposite the center of the
range is Archimedes; the two craters next to the north are, the nearer, Autolycus,
and the farther and larger, Aristillus. The larger of the two dark pits near the
northern end of the Apennines is Eudoxus, the smaller, Aristoteles. Southeast from
these craters lie the Alps, a group of bright peaks extending in a northeast and south-
west direction. A faint, dark streak shows the position of the Alpine Valley. The
flat, irregular area north of the range is the M. Frigoris.

Close inspection of this plate will show that many of the vulcanoids“@ have pits or
cones on their floors, and that these are very often in the center of these level spaces.

The radiating bands or streaks are beginning to appear.

In the Mare Imbrium, near the western end of the Alps, next north of Aristillus,
is Cassini, of which the encircling cone appears to have been partly melted down by
the lava of the mare so that it shows as a faint ridge with a distinct central crater.

@Tn this memoir all the features of the moon commonly termed ‘‘ volcanoes”’ ete.,
are designated by the generic term ‘‘ vulcanoid.”’ ;

PLATE II.
Moon’s age, 10 days 12 hours. Lick Observatory, 1890.

The most noteworthy changes as compared with Pl. I are the great advance in
the development of the fields of very bright hue, and in the bands radiating from
them. These are most evident in the system of Copernicus. The system of Tycho
also begins to be evident. This vulcanoid may be identified as the deep large crater
with a central cone near the border of the illuminated area. The general irregularity
of these light bands is well shown in those about Copernicus. So, too, the fact that
they are projections from an illuminated or lucent field about the vuleanoid.

The relative absence of large vulecanoids on the maria is noteworthy. Those which
exist lie nearly, if not altogether, on fields of high ground which appear to have risen
above the floors of the maria and so escaped melting.

The problematical crater Linné now appears as a small white patch near the mid-
dle of the eastern side of the M. Serenitatis.
PLATE ITI.
Moon’s age, 14 days 1 hour, July 19, 1891. Lick Observatory.

In this plate the moon is nearly full, the light being oblique enough to illuminate
the crater walls on the eastern margin alone.

The maria are well shown nearly to the eastern margin. Separated by a belt of
relatively high ground from the Oceanus Procellarum is the large yuleanoid Grimaldi.
It has a small crater on its floor near its northern side. This yuleanoid has a floor
nearly as dark as the seas. It will be noted that Plato has also a dark floor. On the
margin of the Oceanus Procellarum, southwest of Grimaldi, is a crater Letronne rather
indistinctly seen, the wall of which that faces the maria is, as in other instances,
ruined apparently by the lava of the sea. Other like examples are shown in this
neighborhood. On the shores of the M. Humorum there are three similar instances
of crater walls broken down on the seaward side.

It should be noted that none of the maria distinctly attain the margin of the
moon’s surface. On the eastern lands the O. Procellarum comes near to the border
of the moon, but high, rugged land is cbscurely visible on the very edge. This is
more clearly disclosed at certain stages of libration. On the southwest border some
observers think there is a nearly level area crossing the border, but, as will be seen,
the level land there has not the characteristic dark hue of the maria.

It will be observed that in this nearly vertical light, except Plato, the craters on
the eastern margin only are distinctly visible. Those exceptions are due to the
dark color of their floors. There are two or three craters near the south pole which,
because they have rather dark bottoms, are faintly seen.

At this stage of the waning moon the most interesting of its fields are no longer
visible. There are few that command attention in this plate. It may be noted that
the system of light bands and the central patches whence they proceed, that have
their center in Kepler, are still very bright. The dark mare-like floor of Grimaldi
is visible near the bright margin of the sphere. The observer may obtain something
of the impression, such as is afforded by good seeing with a powerful telescope, that
the Oceanus Procellarum is a relatively shallow sea by the number of fragments of
what seems to have been the more ancient surface that protrude through it.
PLATE V.
Moon’s age, 21 days 16 hours. 1898.

In this plate is depicted an area from near the moon’s equator to near the south
pole. On the eastern margin the sunlight is passing from the surface, the evening
light being so oblique that the bottoms of the vulcanoids are more or less in shadow.
Here and there, in the advancing night, there are lofty peaks on the margin of crater
rims, which still receive a touch of sun and appear as bright points in a black field.
On the western margin the surface is still well illuminated, with the consequent
effect that the surface appears to be much smoother than it is. A view taken a few
hours later would show about as rude a margin as is here depicted.

Perhaps more effectively than any other this view shows how the general surface
of the moon outside of the maria is essentially made up of vulcanoids and ridges, the
apparently smooth parts appearing so only because the small irregularities are not
visible. In this connection it should be noted that near the dark part the surface
is seen to be beset by small shallow craters, the smallest visible being more than a
mile in diameter and probably several hundred feet deep. Such pits, in equal num-
bers to the unit of surface, exist on the bright part to the left when they are observed
by the higher light.

The way in which the smaller craters cut the larger is shown at many points in
this field of view; so, too, the relative lack of sharpness of outline of the greater
vuleanoids as compared with the lesser objects of this group. The low, narrow
ridges which surround the pits are insufficiently shown because the light does not
bring them out. They are best observed near the uppermost part of the picture.

The generality of the fact that the larger craters have flat floors and that these
floors are prevailingly nearly level is well indicated; so, too, the fact that there is
a common tendency of these floors to have either a small crater or a cone in or
near the center of each circular field. Four such craters in the central part of the
area extending in an obscure line from near the base to near the middle of the pic-
ture have cones in their centers. In all, about a dozen of the hundred or so instances
in which they would be recognizable have this feature. It will be evident that all
the craters in this region have their floors far below the level of the encircling ring
and below the general lunar surface.

In sundry instances two adjacent vuleanoids of moderate size have their neighbor-
ing walls broken down so that they exhibit the first stage of ‘‘crater valleys,’’? with
a general north and south axis. There are in all about ten cases of this kind on this
field, but several of them are not well disclosed by this illumination.

PLATE VI.

Photographed by Ritchey with 40-inch telescope, using yellow color screen and isochromatic
plate.

This plate shows part of the southwest quarter of the moon’s visible surface.

On the lower part of the plate is a portion of the Mare Tranquilitatis; on the middle
of the left-hand side a portion of the Mare Nectaris.

The large, deep vulcanoid with the steep, ragged peaks rising from its floor, on the
lower left-hand portion of the plate, is Theophilus, one of the noblest structures on
the moon. The width of the crater is about 64 miles; the greatest height from the
floor to the crest of the wall, 18,000 feet. The central mass, composed of several
sharp peaks, rises about 6,000 feet above the lava plain. In the center of these
masses there appears to be an obscure crater about half a mile in diameter. The
terraces in the inner wall of the cone are indistinctly shown.

Theophilus has partly invaded Cyrillus, the next large yvulcanoid on the southeast,
an older structure with less steep slopes and a generally ruined appearance. South of
Cyrillus, at a distance of half its width, is Catherina. This crater is met by another
of half its diameter, which has developed on one side of its floor. From near the
southeastern margin of Catherina a beautiful row of small craters extends eastwardly
for a distance of over 200 miles to the large vuleanoid Abulfeda. This is perhaps
the most noteworthy crater row on the moon.

The long, curved wall extending from Piccolomini, near the upper left-hand corner
(the large crater with its floor in shadow), to the east side of Catherina, is the Altai
Mountains. Itshould be noted that this step-like structure obscurely extends north-
ward to the M. Tranquilitatis, where it forms an irregular ridge-like promontory.
PLATE VII.

Copernicus and Kepler. Photographed by Ritchey with the 40-inch Yerkes refractor, with
color screen and isochromatic plate.

The most important features exhibited here are the systems of bright rays of
Copernicus, Kepler, and Aristarchus. These three ray systems, though less exten-
sive than those of Tycho, taken together constitute the greatest exhibition of the
bright bands that exist over the northern part of the surface. The complex branched
nature of these bands is particularly well shown—better, indeed, than the writer has
ever been able to note with the telescope. The fact that the bright bands of each
system are prolongations of a central bright field is tolerably well shown.

Although owing to the high sun and the consequent absence of shadows, Coper-
nicus in this view hardly appears as an elevation, it is, under favorable conditions of
illumination, perhaps the noblest object on the moon. The wall on the eastern side,
according to the estimates of Schmidt, rises to a height of 12,000 feet above the
adjacent plain. The outer slopes of the cone are strongly ridged as by the flow
from the crater of lavas which cooled on the steep slopes; some of these are faintly
traceable in the plate.

RAy SYSTEM ABOUT TYCHO.
PLATE VIII.
Ray system about Tycho. Photographed by Ritchey.

This, the most extensive of the ray systems of the moon, has its origin in the field
about Tycho, the large vulcanoid to which the numerous bands apparently converge.
It appears under the high sun as a large pit with a compound central cone. The
rays of this system should be compared with those which have their centers in
Copernicus and Kepler. In these last-named groups the streaks are developed on
relatively level ground, while on that of Tycho they intersect a rugged surface.

On the right hand, some of the bands may be seen crossing the Mare Nubium.
Two of them, of great length, are seen to be nearly parallel for a distance of some
hundred miles.

A number of large vulcanoids, partly in shadow, are shown on the southeast
margin of the moon. Of these, the largest is Schiller. Its length, which is 112 miles,
will serve as a scale in estimating that of the rays.
PLATE IX.

Mare Nubium and surroundings. Photographed by Ritchey, November 21, 1901, 7 hours
32 minutes p.m. Exposure, 1 second.

In this plate Copernicus is the large vulcanoid on the lower margin. The large
crater near the upper margin, a little to the right of the center, with a cone some-
what to the right of its center and ‘‘rill’’ on its floor, is Pitatus. The three great
vuleanoids in a row extending in a north-and-south direction are, in succession
from the lowest toward the upper margin of the plate, Ptolemzeus, Alphonsus, and
Arzachel. The large, deep crater below and to the right of Pitatus, with a divided
central cone, is Bullialdus.

The most noteworthy features in this plate are found in the many instances in
which the lavas of the maria have partly destroyed the vulcanoids within their
fields. In the upper right-hand fourth of the plate there are a dozen or more of
these ruined craters, some of them with their walls almost effaced. In this part of
the field there are seyeral important rills. Some of these are evidently rows of
eraterlets in which the adjacent walls of the pits have been broken down so as to
form a ragged cleft. A number of these lines of craterlets are traceable on the ~
external slopes of Copernicus. The long, dark line, 65 miles in length, in the upper
third of the plate, a little to the left of the center, is the Straight Wall, the most
extensive fault known on the moon. The height of its cliff is about 500 feet. The
creseent-shaned stricture at its sonthern,{unner) end is the remnant of a erater, the
third of the plate, a little to the left of the center, is the Straight Wall, the most
