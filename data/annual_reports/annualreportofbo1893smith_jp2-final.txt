UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893,
BY
G. BROWN GOODE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U. S. National Museum.

I.—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The work of the past year in the Museum, though in many respects
unlike that of previous years, has nevertheless been the direct out-
growth of the activities of more than half a century, and it seems but
proper, before describing current operations, to speak briefly of the
origin and history of the Museum, of its aims and methods, and of its
relations to other national institutions, especially the Smithsonian
Institution, under whose control it was placed at the time of its formal
organization.

A.--THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSEUM.

The history of origin and development has been discussed in previous
reports, and in a paper entitled “* The Genesis of the National Museum.”*
It will therefore be sufficient for our present purpose to repeat a few of
the most essential facts.

The idea of a national museum in the city of Washington was first
suggested by the Hon. Joel R. Poinsett, of South Carolina, Secretary
of War under President Van Buren, who in 1840 organized, for the
purpose of establishing such a museum, a society called ** The National
Institution,” afterwards “The National Institute,” which was for four
years exceedingly prosperous and active. By this society the nucleus
for a national museum was gathered in the Patent Office building in
Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider the estab-
lishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the Govern-
ment of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing the
public recognition at which it is aimed, the society became torpid, and
eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence.

4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents, after many weeks of
consultation and deliberation over the plans for the organization of the
’ Smithsonian Institution, unanimously voted the following resolution :

Resolved, That it is the irtertion of the act of Congress, and in accordance with
the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes
of executing the act and the trust is the accumnlation of collections of specimens
and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a
library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the
end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be
provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall
assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to
the pursuit of any branch of knowledge.”

From 1844 until 1858, when the so-called ‘‘ National Cabinet of Curi-
osities” passed into the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the
term “ National Museum” was notin use. From that time onward,
however, it was used, unofficially, to designate the collections in the
Smithsonian building. After the ‘National Cabinet” was delivered to
the Regents, appropriations were made by Congress for its maintenance.
During the twenty-three years which followed, the collections were
ereatly increased and were made the subjects of numerous important
memoirs upon the natural history and ethnology of America, The pub-
lic halls, with their arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of the
collection, also received a due share of attention, and a certain amount
of instruction and pleasure was afforded to visitors. The appropria-
tions, however, were meagre, the space limited, and the Staff was so
inadequate that little could be done except to keep the collections in
good preservation.

The broad plan upon which the operations of the National Museum
are now conducted was, however, anticipated as far back as 1853, when
Prof. Henry wrote:

There can be little doubt that in due time ample provision will be made for a
library and museum at the capital of this Union worthy of a Government whose
perpetuity depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the people.t

The difficulties attending the formation of such a museum were
appreciated by Prof. Henry, who already in his report for 1849, had
spoken with much emphasis of the caution required in assuming under
the direction of the Institution the care of the national collections.

Prof. Henry, in the report of the Institution for 1870,f again care-
fully expressed his opinion as to the character which should be given
to the National Museum.

There is [he wrote] scarcely any subject connected with science and education to
which more attention is given at the present day than that of collections of objects
of nature and art, known under the general denomination of museums. This arises
from their growing importance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

In the report for 1875 allusion is made to the enormous inerease
in the national collections, “requiring the utmost exertions of the
limited force connected with the National Museum for its proper treat-
ment.” *

Although the appropriations for the Museum have of late years been
more liberal, it is certain that, on account of the immense annual
increase in the quantity of material received, quite as much care and
caution is still needed.

The Smithsonian Institution from its foundation fostered explora-
tions, and its Museum was enriched by the numerous ethnological and
natural history objects brought home by the explorers. Many gifts
were received from private sources, and valuable objects were depos-
ited in its Museum for sate-keeping. The nucleus of its collections
was a small but valuable cabinet of minerals formed by the Founder,
James Smithson, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist of good
repute, and a Feilow of the Royal Society of London.

At the time of the establishment of the Institution several naval
expeditions and surveys of the public domain were being organized
by the Government, and during their progress large collections of
ethnological and natural history objects were made. Important for-
eign material was obtained by the Pacific Exploring Expedition,
Perry’s Expedition to Japan, and the other naval expeditions, while
the naturalists attached to the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican
Boundary Survey, and the surveys under the Army Engineer Corps,
brought together great collections illustrating the natural resources
and ethnology of North America.

A new source of growth, subsequent to 1871, was the exploration
of the waters of North America, by the U.S. Fish Commission, whose
connection with the Institution has always been intimate.

At the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 the exhibits of the
United States Government, and those of numerous foreign govern-
ments and of private exhibitors, came to the National Museum.

A new period now began. The storage rooms and exhibition halls
of the Smithsonian building were already overtlowing with the aceu-
mulations of thirty years, and the small number of persons employed
in caring for them were overburdened and unable to do the necessary
work. The scope of the collections had become wider and a new and
broader classification was found to be necessary. The growth of the
country in wealth and culture was leading to the establishment of
many local museums, and the educational influences flowing from these
and from the Centennial Exhibition caused a demand for more efficient
methods of musuem administration.

The exhibition of 1876 had been indeed an event of great educational
importance to the people ef the United States; and not the least of its

~ Report, Smithsonian Institution, 1873, p. 48.
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

good works was the lesson it taught as to the possibilities for good in
public museums.

The objects which at the close of the Centennial were given to the
United States for its National Museum were of large intrinsic value,
and were also very important from the fact that the necessity of caring
for them led to the erection of a large building for the expansion of the
Museum itself.

In 1881, after the new building had been completed, the Museum
was entirely reorganized.

In the early years Prof. S. F. Baird, then Assistant Secretary, with
two or three assistants, was able to give all necessary attention to the
care of the collections, and the Museum was not formally divided into
departments.

When the reorganization was made in 1881, under the immediate care
of the present Assistant Secretary, the diversity of the collections
made it necessary to establish a number of departments, each of which
was placed in charge of a curator, and the staff has since been con-
stantly increasing. Thisis at present composed of the officer in charge
and thirty-two curators and acting curators, twenty-two of whom
receive no salary from the Museum. There are also eleven administra-
tive offices, each under its own chief, while in connection with the gen-
eral work of administration there is in the Museum a library, a chemi-
cal laboratory, a photographic laboratory, and various workshops for
taxidermy, modeling, and for the preparation of skeletons for exhibi-
tion. ;

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSEUM IDEA.

The history of the National Museum may, then, be divided into three
periods :—

First, that from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to
1857, during which time specimens were collected purely and solely to
serve as materials for research, no special efforts being made to exhibit
them to the public or to utilize them except as a foundation for scien-
tific description and theory.

Second, the period from 1857, when the institution assumed the cus-
tody of the ‘‘ National Cabinet of Curiosities,” to 1876. During this
period the Museum became a place of deposit tor scientific material
which had already been studied, this material, so far as convenient,
being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve
an educational purpose.

Third, the present period, beginning in the year 1876, within which the
Museum has entered more fully into the work of gathering collections
and exhibiting them on account of their value from an educational
standpoint.

In the first period the main object of the Museum was scientifie
research; in the second, the establishment became a museum of record
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7
as well as of research, while in the third period is growing up the idea
of public education.

In closing this general statement it may be well to mention what
seem to be the things definitely accomplished since the time of reor-
ganization in 1881.

The definite steps of progress may be summarized as follows:

(1) An organization of the Museum staff has been effected, efticient
for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as oceca-
sion may require, and many capable museum-experts have been trained
for work in other institutions.

(2) Through the agency of this staff the materials in the Museum,
the accumulations of nearly half acentury, have been examined, classi-
fied, and brought under control and arranged in such manner as to
insure their safely and make them available for study.

(3) The collections have been increased to more than fifteen-fold their
former extent.

(4) A considerable beginning has been made toward the development
of a well labeled and effectively installed exhibition series, available
for the instruction of the public.

(5) A thorough study of the organization and systems of classifica-
tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff and
which will be made available for other institutions through a report
upon the principles and methods of museum administration, now in prep-
aration.

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by experi-
ment in the Museum, and the best and most available employed else-
where have been adopted. Our new methods are being adopted in
many similar establishments at home and abroad.

(7) The art of taxidermy and the making of museum models have
been advanced and dignified by the policy adopted in the treatment of
the experts in the empley of the Museum.

(8) Science has been forwarded by the publication of some thousands
of papers describing the materials in the Museum, while the work of
specialists in the production of these papers has greatly enhanced the
value of the national collections.

(9) Popular educational work of unquestionable value has been accom-
plished by participation in great expositions in Philadelphia, Berlin,
London, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville, Madrid, and Chicago.

(10) Hundreds of thousands of named specimens have been distrib-
uted to other museums and to colleges and schools.

THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE FUTURE.

It is evident that a National Museum worthy of the dignity of the
nation must always be maintained in the city of Washington.
Every country has a museum or group of museums in its capital
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

city—centers of scientific and educational activity—the treasure-house
of the people, filled with memorials of national triumphs in the fields
of science, art, and industrial progress. *

These are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character
of its museum and libraries intelligent persons visiting any country
very properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the
civilization of the people.

Washington may without question be made the seat of one of the
greatest museums in the world. It may perhaps be neither practicable
nor desirable to gather together in this city extensive collections of
xarly works of art, but a representative series of such objects will
undoubtedly grow up which will tend to educate the public taste, and
promote the study of the elements of art and the history of civiliza-
tion, and forward the arts of design. Attention must, however, be
directed mainly toward the exposition of the geology and natural
history of America and its natural resources, to the preservation of
memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the encouragement of the
arts and industries of our own people.

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of
necessity have features peculiar to itself developed in response to the
peculiar needs of the people of this continent. It should be remem-
bered that the national collections of every principal European nation
are divided into several groups, each under separate administration,
though often within the general control of some central authority. In
France, for instance, most of the museums are under the ministry of pub-
lic instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the department
of science and art.

In the great capitals of Europe the public collections are scattered
through various parts of the same city, in museums with distinctive
names and independent in their organizations. Much of the work
which should properly be done by such museums is omitted, because
no one of them has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand,
much labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate, col-
lections of similar scope and purpose being maintained in different parts
of the same city. One of the chief objections to such division of effort
1s that much of the value of large collections in any department is lost
by failure to concentrate them where they may be studied and com-
pared side by side. In Washington the national collections are all.
without exception, concentrated in one group of buildings. The Army
Medical Museum now occupies a building side by side with those under
the control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this proximity, in con-
nection with the long-established policy of cooperation between the
two organizations, renders them, for all practical purposes, united in
jnterest.

*Most of the older nations have museums devoted to their military achievements
and triumphs, but our country has no need or desire to enter into this field of work.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main-
tenance of the National Museum are small, compared with those in
several European countries, the value of objects given by private indi-
viduals is proportionately larger. The actual value of such contribu-
tions for ten years past, has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000
a year, and in some years has been greater.

Among important gifts may be mentioned such as the George Catlin
Indian gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and
ethnologist; the Baird collection of North American vertebrates; the
collection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, con-
taining, besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000 conchological
specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; the Bendire and
talph collections of American birds’ eggs given to the Smithsonian
institution; the Lacoe collection of fossil plants, and the collection
of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transfer of
which from Philadelphia to Washington a special appropriation was
made by Congress. ;

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution which have not
yet come into its possession. It is estimated that within the past fifteen
years individuals to the number of at least 2,000 have made gifts to
the Museum to the value of $100 or more,

Almost every day strangers, pleased with the work of the Museum,
voluntarily send in contributions more or less important.

The National Museum now contains over three millions of objects.

The late Prof. Baird was once asked whether the value of the collee-
tions in the National Museum was equal to the amount which had been
expended inits maintenance. He replied unhesitatingly that, although
it would be by no means a fair criterion of their value, he did not doubt
that by a judicious and careful system of sale the entire sum could be
recovered. What was said ten years ago by Prof. Baird is more than
true to-day.

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the
manner in which its collections are increasing. In 1893 the number of
Specimens is more than fifteen times as great as ten years before.

In the last fiscal year 1,200 new lots or groups of specimens were
entered upon the Museum catalogues.

This increase, as has been shown, is, in large degree, spontaneous,
only a small amount of inoney having ever been available for the pur-
chase of new material.

As might be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given
are duplicates of material already on hand, and although these contri-
butions can, with the utmost advantage, be used for distribution to
museums and schools, they do not materially increase the value of the
collections for study by specialists and for general educational purposes.
The need of a larger fund for the purchase of specimens is yearly more
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

manifest. Execeedingly important material is constantly offered at
prices very much below what it would cost to obtain it by collecting,
and in many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken by the museums
and institutions of Hurope.

The Museum in its present condition may be compared to a book from
which pages here and there have been omitted, so that the narrative is
disjointed and incomplete.

In certain museums of Europe more money is expended annually in
purchases then is represented by the entire appropriations for the
National Museum. There are instances even in this country in which
more money is expended for the improvement of private museums.
The officers of the Museum have repeatedly suffered the chagrin of
being compelled to refuse the offer of specimens necessary to complete
the collections, and to see them pass into the hands of private insti-
tutions in this country or the government museums in Europe. For
the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum, from
1853 to 1887, $1,586,634 was expended, or a yearly average of nearly
$47,000.

England is equally liberal toward her other museums. Exact
statistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that
her average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums
in London is not less than $500,000 a year.

The museums of Europe are rich with the accumulations of cen-
turies. The National Museum of the United States is young, and has
enormous deficiencies in every department. It needs, more than any
musewn in Europe, the opportunity to increase its resources through
purchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens
for the National Museum since its foundation has not exceeded $20,000,
and never in one year more than $8,500.

Our treasures are the result of the activities of an enlightened Govern-
ment. Through a thousand channels materials for the formation of a
musewm come into the possession of the Government, and out of such
materials our Museum has been built. A museum formed in this man-
ner, however, suffers sooner or later from immense accumulations of
objects of certain kinds and from the absence of others. This is true
of the National Museum. At the outset no additions were unwelcome,
and the expectation that all important deficiencies would be supplied
might properly be indulged in. As the years have passed, however, it
has become more and more apparent that many of these deficiences can
only be supplied by purchase.

More striking present results might certainly have been attained by
limiting the development of the Museum to special fields. We have,
however, had in view the future as well as the present, and no object
has been refused a place in the Museum which is likely to be needed
even in the remote future, in the development of whatever grand
museum plans the nation may ultimately be willing to promote.

The National Museum is under the charge of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Regents of
the Institution.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the “ keeper
of the Smithsonian Museum,” and the Assistant Secretary, by the
usage of nearly fifty years, its executive head.

In the act of Congress passed in 1846 to establish the Smithsonian
Institution are contained the following provisions concerning the scope
of the museum to be placed under its charge:

1. The act above referred to provides that ‘ail objects of art and
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history,

_ plants, ‘and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or
hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city
of Washington,” shall be delivered to the Regents of the Smithson-
ian Institution, and together with new specimens obtained by
exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be se arranged and classified
as best to facilitate ‘examination and study.

It provides that, in proportion as suitable arrangements can
be made for their reception, these objects shall be delivered to such
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive
them.

>. It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so
classified as best to facilitate their examination and study.

4, It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building
to be inclosed for the Institution.

5, It authorizesthe Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange
of duplicate specimens, and by gift, and directs also that they shall
be appropriately classed and arranged.

The National Museum thus became the authorized place of deposit
for all objects of art, archeology, ethnology, natural history, miner-
alogy, geology, ete., belonging to the United States or collected by any
agency whatsoever for the Government of the United States, when no
longer needed for investigations in progress.

The collections in the Museum are intended to exhibit the natural
and industrial resources, primarily of the United States and second-
arily of other parts of the world, for purposes of comparison.

The activities of the Museum are exerted especially in three
directions :

1. The permanent preservation of the collections already in its
possession, which depends chiefly upon the vigilance of the curators
and the skill of the preparators.

2. The increase of the collections which are acquired—

(1) From the various Government surveys and expeditions, in
accordance with law;

(2) By gift from individuals, from other institutions, and from
foreign governments;

3) By exchange for its duplicate specimens or publications:
(4) By the efforts of officers of the Museum, who make collections
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

in connection with their regular duties, or are detailed for special
service of this nature;

(5) By purchase when appropriations are made by Congress for
that purpose.

3. The utilization of the collections, which is effected by exhibiting
them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part of
the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and facilitating
the publication of the results; also by the distribution to other museums
and edueational institutions of duplicate specimens, which have formed
the basis of scientific investigation, these being identified and labeled
by the best authorities.

The Museum by these means fulfills a threefold function :

1. It becomes a museum of record, in which are preserved the mate-
rial foundations ef a very great number of memoirs—tie types of
numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those
materials which have served as a foundation for the numerous Govern-
mental reports upon the resources of the United States. Types of
investigations made outside of the Museum are also incorporated.

2. It becomes a museum of research, by reason of the policy which
aims to make its contents serve as fully as possible as a stimulus to
and a foundation for the studies of scientific investigators. Research
is a necessary part of the work,in order that the collections may be
properly identified and arranged. Its officers are selected for their
‘sapacity as investigators as well as for their ability as custodians, and
its treasuries are open to the use of any trustworthy student.

3. It becomes an educational museum, by reason of its policy of illus-
trating specimens of every group of natural objects and, so far as it may
prove practicable, such other collections as may be found useful for the
instruction of the public, which are explained by displaying descriptive
labels adapted to the popular mind, and by its policy of distributing its
publications and its series of duplicates named, classified, and labeled.

The collections of the National Museum are made up to a very large
extent of the following materials:

1. The natural history and anthropological collections accumu-
lated since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of
the Smithsonian Institution.

2, Collections which have resulted from explorations carried on
more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution or resulting from explorations carried on by the Smithsonian
Institution in connection with educational institutions or com-
mercial establishments.

3. Collections which have been obtained through the courtesy of
the Department of State and the cooperation of United States
ministers and consuls.

4, The collection of the Wilkes exploring expedition, the Perry
expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

5. Colleetions made by the scientific officers of Government sur-
veys, such as the Pacifie Railroad survey, the Mexican boundary
survey, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. i

U.S. Army, and by officers of the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army
aes in remote regions.

6. Collections obtained by the U.S. pote aio Survey, the U.S.
Fish Commission, and those resulting from the activities of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and other Departments of the U.S. Gov-
ernment.

7. The remnant of the collections of the old ‘* National Institute.”

8. The collections made by the United States to illustrate the
animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the enthnology of
the native races of the country on the occasion of the Inter national
Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876; the fishery collections dis-
played by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhi-
bition at Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, and the collections
obtained from various local expositions, as, for instance, the New
Orleans Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and in 1885, and the
Cincinnati Exposition in 1887.

9. The collections given by the governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at
Philadelphia in 1876,

10, The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing
and commercial houses of Europe and America at the time of the
P ee exhibition and subsequently.

Lhe materials received, in exchange for duplicate specimens,
on museums in Europe and America.
12. Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange, from
Pa cduale numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year.

In connection with the general work of administration there is in the
Museum a library, a chemical laboratory, a photographie establishment,
and various workshops for taxidermy, modeling, and for the prepara-
tion of skeletons for exhibition. In connection with the department of
art aud industry two preparators are constantly employed.

The publications of the Museum consist of—

1. The Annual Report;

2. The Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum;

3. The Bulletin of the U.S. National Museum;

4. The series of Circulars.

The Proceedings and Bulletins, have in part, been reprinted in the
volumes of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

Papers prepared by the Museum staff, or based upon the collections,
have been printed in every scientific periodical in the United States
and in many of those of Europe.

THE RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Smithsonian Institution, though it bears the name of a private
citizen and a foreigner, has been for nearly half a century one of the
principal rallying points of the scientific workers of America. It has
also been intimately connected with very many of the most important
scientific undertakings of the Government.

Many wise and enlightened scholars have given to its service the
best years of their lives, and some of the most eminent scientific nen
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

our country has given birth to have passed their entire lifetime in work
for its success. Its publications, 970 in number, which when combined
make up over 200 dignified volumes, are to be found in every important
library in the world, and some of them, it is safe to say, on the working
table of every scientific investigator in the world. .

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by
its system of international exchange, by means of which within the
past forty-two years 1,580,075 packages of books and other scientific
and literary materials have been distributed to every region of the
earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as far reaching as that of
any other institution of learning in the world.

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun-
tries of American art, of American literature, or American institutions
generally, the science of America is accepted without question as equal
to the best.

In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European coun-
tries the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific publi-
‘ations of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the
Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Com
mission, and they are constantly holding up the Government of the
United States as an example of what governments should do for the
support of their scientific institutions.

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by other nations, and
it is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, nor more in
accord with the injunction of Washington in his Farewell Address,
admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as president of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science:

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion
of knowledge.

In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion it should be
enlightened.

No one has been able to show why Smithson selected the United
States as the seat of his foundation. He had no acquaintances in Amer-
ica, nor does he appear to have had any books relating to America except
two. Rhees quotes from one of these (Travels through North America,
by Isaae Weld, secretary of the Royal Society), a paragraph concerning
Washington, then a sinall town of 5,000 inhabitants, in which it is pre-
dicted that “the Federal city, as soon as navigation is perfected, will
increase most rapidly, and that at a future day, if the affairs of the
United States go on as rapidly as they have done, it will become the
grand emporium of the West and rival in magnitude and splendor the
cities of the whole world.”
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, realiz-
ing that while the needs of England were well met by existing organi-
zations such as would not be likely to spring up for many years in a
new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England an
institution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of ineal-
culable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the
United States would have been to-day without this bequest?

In the words of John Quincy Adams:

Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses which ever signal-
ized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence of the founder, none can be
named more deserving the approbation of mankind.

The most important service, by far, which the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has rendered to the nation has been from year to year since 1846—
intangible but none the less appreciable—by its constant cooperation
with the Government, public institutions, and individuals in every
enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed its advice, support,
or aid from its resources.

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the
extent of which can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them.
The most important of these are the library and the Museum, which
have grown up under its fostering care.

The liprary has been accumulated without aid from the Treasury of
the United States, It has, in fact, been the result of an extensive sys-
tem of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been used
to obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all parts
of the world.

In return for its own publications the Institution has received the
books which form its library.

This library, consisting of more than a quarter of a million volumes
and parts of volumes, has for over twenty years been deposited at the
Capitol as a portion of the Congressional Library and is constantly
being increased. In the last fiscal year 37,982 titles were thus added
to the national collection of books.

Chiefly through its exchange system the Smithsonian had in 1865
accumulated about 40,000 volumes, largely publications of learned
societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the world in
all that pertains to the mental and physical development of the human
family, and affording the means of tracing the history of at least every
branch of positive science since the days of revival of letters until the
present time.

These books, in many instances gifts from old European libraries,
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best
collections of the kind in the world.

The warning given by the fire of that year,and the fact that the
greater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into
insufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

be incurred for their binding, enlarged room, and other purposes con-
nected with their use, threatened to grow beyond the means of the
Institution, appear to have been the moving causes which determined
the Regents to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place
the Smithsonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the
right of the Regents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of
binding, ete. Owing to the same causes (which have affected the
library of Congress itself) these principal conditions, except as regards
their custody in a fire-proof building, have never been fulfilled.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they
have now increased from 40,000 to fully’250,000 volumes and parts of
volumes, and form one of the most valuable collections of the kind in
existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more crowded
and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer.

This condition of affairs will happily soon be remedied.

The purchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit
is exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a con-
siderable extent in behalf of the National Museum.

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private
fund of the Institution in the publication of books for gratuitous clis-
tribution has been fully half as much as the original Smithson bequest.

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways,
but, in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the
outlay has, through their buying power, come into the possession of the
nation.

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the
Smithsonian Institution. The value of the collections thus acquired is
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson
bequest.

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library.
It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the
scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 1876
that it was officially recognized as the National Museum of the United
States.

But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution,
the United States would probably still be without a reputable nucleus
for a national museum.

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for
many years established in Washington, which replaces the old Smith-
sonian courses, once so influential, and the assistance which it affords
each year to students of science, 1s referred to elsewhere in this report.

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien-
tific subjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. In addi-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

tion to this, alarge correspondence is carried on with people in search of
information on scientific topics. Probably 6,000 letters a year go out
to people who write seeking to know the name of some object or other
scientific fact. Inquiries of this kind are always answered promptly and
fully; and frequently, to intelligent inquirers, books are sent which will
enable them to find out such names for themselves in future. This
work has not only an educational value, but often a great economic
importance as well; as, for instance, when some common mineral has
been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant has been wrongly
identified and supposed to be of service in medicine, or some harmless
animal feared as noxious.

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every
State and almost every county in the United States. A careful study
of the subject, recently made by the president of one of the scientific
societies in Washington, seems to indicate that there are several States
which are reached by no scientific publications, whatever, except those
distributed gratuitously by the Government.

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the
Museum or any other trust which it administers, it may be stated that
nothing could be so desirable for the Institution as that Congress
should examine for itself whether, on the whole, in the execution of
the trust of Smithson, more has been given to the Government than
has been received; for if, in attempting to increase and diffuse knowl-
edge among mankind, the machinery of the Institution’s action has
been such that it has incidentally paid over to the Government the
equivalent of much more than the whole original fund, these facts
should surely be known to those who have to ask themselves in what
spirit as well as for what purpose the Institution expends money placed
in its charge.

Mr. Langley has pointed out that ‘although by the judicious
administration of the Smithson fund nearly $1,500,000—the fruits of
its investment—have been applied during the past forty years to the
advancement of science and education in America (in addition to the
principal, $911,000, larger now than ever before), it should be remem-
bered that the unrestricted income of the Institution is less than
$50,000 a year, a Sum much smaller in its power to effect results than
ever in previous years.”

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement
liberally this private contribution for public good, especially if it be
borne in mind that, as Mr. Langley has recently shown, the Institu-
tion has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone,
property acquired out of its private fund (and to which it has appar-
ently the same title) which is probably now more than equal in value to
the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest.

Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form
of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources.

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

The character of the National Museum is fundamentally affected by its
connection with the Smithsonian Institution, its dependence upon Con-
gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity, under existing
laws, of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government.

Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution,
it should be said that it is in the highest degree advantageous. It
should be borne in mind that it is essentially a Smithsonian museum,
since, especially in its earlier history, the Institution expended large
sums of money in aiding explorations, with the distinct purpose of
increasing the collections in certain directions, while of late years it
has deposited all the valuable gifts and bequests of specimens it has
received. It has had in addition, for nearly half a century, the use of
the larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and what is of para-
mount importance, the guidance and influence of the officers of the
Institution, and the very valuable assistance of its numerous corre-
spondents.

C.—THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM IN PUBLIC EDUCATION.

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to
justify its maintenance and extension. The Museum, however, not
only performs these functions, but also does a very great deal to ren-
der the resources of science available to the public at large.

Prof. Huxley’s definition of a museum is that it is “a consultative
library of objects.”

The National Museum is a ccnsultative library for the scientific man,
and it is something more. It aims to be an agency for the instruction
of the people of the whole country, and to keep especially in mind the
needs of those whose lives are not occupied in the study of science.

In a recent address before the American Historical Association, I
attempted to explain the idea of our work as follows:

(1) That publie institutions of learning are not intended for the few,
but for the enlightenment and education of the masses.

(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of
the work of the scientific establishments whick they are helping to
maintain.

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions
is to provide means by which such results may be presented in an
attractive as well as an intelligible form.

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of
the diffusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution, and no
department of its activity has greater possibilities in this respect than
is the National Museum.

The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from ali
parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

mstitutions and their visitors throughout the country, through the dis-
tribution of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, which are made
up into sets, accurately named, and distributed to schools and museums.

In the next annual report it will be shown how many hundred thou-
sands of objects have been thus distributed during the past twenty
years. Every museum in the United States has profited in this way,
and by its system of exchange the Museum has, while enriching itself,
contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific museum
in the world.

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other
ways. Within the last year not less than forty local museums in the
United States were supplied with working plaus of cases in use in the
Museum, and similar sets of plans have been supplied within the past
few years to national museums in other countries.

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but also to a
very considerable extent directly and personally.

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an
authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff
of experts is thus placed without cost at the service of every citizen.

It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefly upon
the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are
absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public to
the enjoyment and instruction which museums afford. They do not
hesitate to say that scientific museums should be administered for the
benefit solely of persons engaged in research. Such men would find no
welcome among us. .

At arecent meeting of professional naturalists an eminent investi-
gator in natural science publicly expressed his opposition to exhibiting
certain scientific collections to “the gaping clowns who form the
majority of the visitors to our museums.” Such a spirit defeats its
own purposes and such a remark deserves rebuke. The experience of
Europe with its magnificent educational museums and the history of
the several expositions in the United States should be quite sufficient
to satisfy any one who has studied the matter, that the museum is an
educational power of no slight potency.

The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, the late Sir
Philip Cunliffe Owen, speaking from an experience of thirty-five years,
not only in his own establishment, but in the work of building up the
score of sister museums now under its wing, located in the various
provincial towns of Great Britain, remarked to the writer:

_ We educate our working people in the publie schools, and give them a love for
refined and beautiful objects, and a desire for information. They leave school, enter
town life, see only dirty streets and monotonous rows of buildings, and have no way
to gratify the tastes which they have been forced to acquire. It is as much the
duty of the Government to provide them with museums and libraries for their higher
education as it is to establish schools for their primary instruction.
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

In the same conversation, Sir Philip insisted very strongly that a
museum not actually engaged in educational work of some kind could
not long survive, and as an example of one such field of activity pointed
to the great system of lectures and examinations connected with the
Science and Art Department of the Council of Edueation, of which the
South Kensington Museum is one of the chief agencies.

———
IIL.—RECENT ADVANCES IN MUSEUM METHOD.

The importance of the Museum as an agency for the education of the
young and for the culture and enlightenment of the public in general
is each year becoming better understood.

The control of all museums is passing out of the hands of mere care-
takers, or showmen, and is being assumed by men of intelligence and
enterprise, whose purpose it is to elevate this agency of public culture
to a plane of higher usefulness.

Museum-practice has become to such an extent an art that some
years of training and experience in a well-organized general museum
are almost essential. Intelligence, a liberal education, administrative
ability, enthusiasm, and that special endowment which may be called
‘‘the museum sense” are sinply prerequisite qualifications.

Any museum which employs an untrained curator must expect to pay
the cost of his education in delays, experimental failures, and waste
of material.

A museum without intelligent, progressive, and well-trained cura-
tors is as ineffective as a school without teachers, a library without
a librarian, or a learned society without a working membership of
learned men.

Such facts as these are gradually becoming impressed upon the pub-
lic mind, and although the community within which a given museum is
located may not for a time concern itself actively about its shortcom-
ings, all the good work which it does is at once appreciated, and if
advances are in progress, their results are eagerly awaited.

The ‘Museums Association,” recently organized in England, is doing
excellent work in that country. Such an organization is perhaps not
yet necessary in the United States, where local museums are so few,
but in time one will doubtless be organized. In the meantime the
American Society of Naturalists is so situated that it can perform a
part of the work proper to such an organization.

Sir W. H. Flower, the superintendent of the British Museum of Nat-
ural History, in his address at the last meeting of the ** Museums Asso-
ciation” remarked:

Of the museums of the United States of America much may beexpected, They are
starting up in all directions, untramelled by the restrictions and traditions which
envelope so many of our old institutions at home, and many admirable essays on

museum work have reached us from the other side of the Atlantic, from which it
appears that the new idea has taken firm root there. *

*Report of the Museums Association, fourth general meeting, 1893, p. 42.
21
ae REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

Itis gratifying to know that even in the smaller towns of Europe

the ideals which we hold before us in our work are appreciated and
quoted. The “ Brighton Herald” of August 18, 1894, contained the
following editorial comment:
"All those remarkably constituted persons who maintain that we do not want a
museum in Brighton would do well to read a well-written little brochure by Dr.
Charles A. White, of the U. 8. National Museum, entitled ‘‘The relations of biology
to geological investigations.” It is a philosophical subject, philosophically treated,
demonstrating the important relation that museums hold to science and to civiliza-
tion as centers of learning and conservatories of the evidence concerning acquired
knowledge. Museums [he concludes] should not only be made safe treasure-houses
of science, but they should be what their name implies, temples of study perpetually
open to all investigators.

In our own country the spirit of museum extension is spreading, as
is shown by such articles as that by Prof. Morse in the “ Atlantic
Monthly,” entitled ‘‘If Public Libraries why not Public Museums,”
which is reprinted in a subsequent part of thisreport. It is the highest
ambition of the National Museum to be associated actively in the work
of museum reform, and to feel that we are standing shoulder to shoulder
in this respect with the older institutions of Europe, and that this fact
is recognized by them.

As we have werked along from year to year, always striving to do
the best thing possible under the circumstances, we have always taken
first into consideration the plans in use in other museums, and have
either cast them aside as unavailable, modified them for our own needs,
or frankly adopted them.

So it has come to pass that we have a large number of forms of cases
and devices for installation, fitted to meet almost every need of museum
or exposition administrators. These are always placed freely at the
disposal of those who need them. Working drawings and _ photo-
graphs of cases, and samples of fixtures of every kind are freely lent.
When the museum has had made, for its own use, expensive tools, such
as molds for specimen jars or pedestal tiles, or dies for corrugating
metal for the sliding-racks of storage cases, these are placed without
charge at the service of public institutions, and the use of blocks for
illustrating reports is always accorded,

In this way the entire resources and experience of the National
Museum are placed at the disposal of even the smallest country muse-
ums, and this policy has, we hope, been very beneficial.

In pursuance of this policy some of the most instructive of our recent
experiments are described in this report, in advance of a fuller diseus-
sion in a comprehensive work on the principles and methods of museum
administration, which has been in preparation for some years. This is
done with less hesitation because of the example set by Dr. A. B. Meyer,
whose papers on the methods of the Royal Zoological and Anthropo-
logical- Ethnographic Museum in Dresden have proved so interesting to
all museum workers, and who, rightly thinking that. museums are
doing too much in the way of experiment and too little in utilizing the

MUSEUM CASES.

Of all the practical questions which confront the museum adminis-
trator those relating to the form and construction of cases and the
methods of interior fitting are among the most perplexing and, so far
as the relationships of the museum to the public are concerned, the most
important. Each well-arranged case with its display of specimens and
labels is a perpetual lecturer, and the thousands of such constantly on
duty in every large museum have their effect upon a much larger num-
ber of minds than the individual efforts of the scientific staff, no matter
how industrious with their pens or in the lecture room.

Ever since the occupation of our new building very special attention
has been given to improving the cases, and a system, peculiar in the
beginning to the National Museum, though since adopted by others, has
grown up—a system based upon a fixed and interchangeable unit of
construction; so that, to a very large degree, it is possible to transfer
cases from one department to another. This fixed unit is the storage
drawer or “unit drawer,” 24 by 50 inches in dimensions (PI. 1, fig. 1).
Modifications and extensions of this unit are very generally in use in
many forms of cases, both for exhibition and storage. (PI. 1, fig. 2.)

Exhibition cases —The various kinds of cases now in use are indi-
cated in a general way in the two accompanying plates. (Pls. 2 and
3.) Fuller descriptions of the cases and their manner of construction
will be reserved for a future report. It may be said, however, that the
tendency has been toward the use of the very best of glass in the largest
possible sizes, the woodwork being, as a rule, restricted to bases, corner
pieces, and cornices. The top of the case—no matter what its size—is
of glass. When possible, where two panes of glass are used in a single
case front, a narrow metal connecting strip is used instead of a wooden
bar.

The theory which has led to the development of this form of case is
that collections should be so arranged that each surface of glass, or
each panel of a long case, stands by itself, its contents being grouped
with reference to a general descriptive label, either placed in their
midst or in the middle of the case-frame above. It is not considered
legitimate to arrange series of specimens on long shelves extending
from one end to the other in cases whose fronts are broken by panels
or doors; but, as has been said before, each panel or door stands for
itself, like the page of a book, the arrangement being without excep-
tion from left to right, as in a book.

The breaking of the view of a specimen or an exhibit by a horizontal
bar is also avoided, and when horizontal sash-bars are necessary (as —
in a cheap case where small panes of glass are used) the situation is
relieved as much as possible by placing a shelf behind this horizontal
bar, so that it is in effect a part of the shelf.

The form of case with which we are at present best satisfied is shown
in the illustrations of some of the groups of Indians. (Pls, 51 and 52.)
Where smaller objects are shown, a large proportion of the height of
the case is occupied by the base in which * unit drawers” are fitted.

We have also introduced an inexpensive and practical adjustment
of the doors of the larger cases, by means of which these may be raised
instead of swinging upon hinges, thus doing away with the exceedingly
objectionable swinging doors, so undesirable in narrow aisles and so
inconvenient to curators. With the new system the cost of the mechan-
ical appliances for swinging the sash is almost compensated for by the
saving in hinges, wrench-locks, clamping-bars. and special contrivances
for dust-prooting. The general appearance of these cases is shown in
the accompanying plate. (PI. 4.)

So perfect is this adjustment that a glass door weighing more than
one hundred pounds may be lifted with one finger. The complicated
arrangement of cranks and levers used in many old-fashioned cases is
entirely unnecessary.

The advantages of iron and steel exhibition-cases have been urged
with so much enthusiasm of late that it seems proper to say that the
question of the use of iron has been constantly under consideration
here since 1879. All the different forms of iron cases have been studied,
including the Dresden cases constructed by Prof. Meyer which were
inspected by the writer in 1880, and the wooden-sheathed iron cases
in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. This was
before the system of wooden cases, which we now use, had been
adopted. When the new Museum building was finished, in 1881, the
use of iron cases was practically decided upon, and sample cases were
made, in general accordance with the Meyer plans. They were found,
however, to be much more expensive than wooden cases, heavier, and
less easy toadapt to special uses. They offered no material advantage,
except, possibly, a greater durability. The limitations of iron in the
matter of design are manifest, and the impossibility of securing the
polished surfaces of wood, which add so much to the attractiveness of
a museum case, was another reason against iron construction.

Looking back fourteen years to the time when iron was rejected, no
reason appears for regretting the decision then made.

The use of Mexican or Frontier mahogany which is well known as
softer and straighter grained than the West India variety so popular
for furniture, has been continued, and no other is so thoroughly suit-
able, so far as color is concerned, though the oaks when used have,
in other respects, given great satisfaction. When black cases are
required, cherry wood is employed and an ebony finish added.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 25

Some cases have been made in which corner pieces. of wood or metal
have been entirely dispensed with, as in that containing the reprodue
tion of the Bryant Memorial Vase (Pl. 5). This ingenious method
requires mechanical skill of the highest quality, and the expense is so
great that it is only justifiable in the case of very precious objects
which require tobe hermetically sealed. The cost of this special recep-
tacle was $395. It is the most expensive case, for its size, in this museum,
and is an exceedingly beautiful piece of work.

In fitting cases with shelves the so-called « Gavit bracket,” invented
by Prof. Edward S, Morse, of the P -abody Museum, in Salem, which is
supported upon racks secured to the side, of upright bars, in the back
of the cases, has always been thoroughly satisfactory. In some instances
where heavy objects, like minerals, are to be shelved and the question
of protection against insects is not involved the “Jenks bracket,”
which fits with a triangular knob into an aperture of similar shape in
a metal plate secured to the back of the case, has been substituted.

Another kind of bracket Support which seems to have great possi-
bilities is the invention of Mr. Henry Horan. It is constructed of iron
pipe and is exceedingly light and strong. The essential features of
this contrivance are shown in Plate 6.

The use of clear, strong colors for backgrounds is continued, the
only changes having been in the direction of better and purer pigments.
Many experiments have been made and the number of colors used
have been reduced to two—a maroon corresponding to that custom-
arily seen on the walls of art galleries, for large cases in brilliantly
lighted halls where the installation is not crowded, and a light, warm
buff, somewhat resembling in tint the Solenhofen lithographic stone,
but somewhat warmer, in cases and halls where specimens are crowded
or where much light is for any reason desirable. This luminous buff is
also used very largely upon ceilings and the upper parts of walls,
while the maroon is used on walls up to the level of the tops of the
cases, harmonizing admirably with the mahogany furniture. Glass
Shelves are used when possible, even in cases for natural history objects.

The intluence of the National Museum system of case construction
and labeling was manifest everywhere throughout the American exhibits
at the World’s Fair, particularly in the Government building, the Lib-
eral Arts building, the Fisheries building (where Norway also had in
part adopted our style), the Woman’s building, some of the State build-
ings, and particularly in the exhibit of the Pennsylvania Railroad. where
our cases and labels were adopted under the direction of one of our
curators.

Storage cases.—A modification of the English form of sliding mechan-
ism, by means of which drawers of different depths are used inter-
changeably throughout a long series of storage cases, has been in use in
the Museum since 1882. At least 30,000 of the standard drawers, 2
by 30 inches, are in use for the reception of minerals, fossils, aud zoo-
26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

logical specimens of all kinds, as well as in the departments of ethnology
and archeology.

Besides these there are over 10,000 unit boxes fitted with glass fronts,
which also, when necessary, are worked into the same system. 7

The storage case, from which the idea was originally taken, was, I
believe, first invented by Prof. Strickland, of Cambridge, England, and
afterwards modified by Mr. Osbert Salvin. As at first constructed in
the National Museum, the sliding strips in the storage cases were tri-
angular pieces of hard wood, 1 inch in width and one-half inch wide
at the top, sloping to one-eighth inch at the bottom. (PI. 7, fig. 3.)
These were nailed horizontally close together upon each side of the case,
while in the grooves thus formed were received the corresponding strips
nailed upon the two sides of each drawer—strips originally of the same
size but trimmed slightly in order that they might run smoothly.

The top, or thin edge, of the slide-strip was always placed 1 inch
below the top of the unit drawer, or 2 inches below the top of the glass-
covered unit box, and since the depth of these unit drawers and unit
boxes was always an even number of inches, a drawer of any depth
could be used, from 2 to 14 inches, and a corresponding drawer of any
depth could be placed above or below it. Any compartment could thus
be filled with unit drawers of any desired depth.

The first improvement in this mechanism grew out of the desire to
secure still greater tightness. The interior of the compartment was
lined with zine, and the strips were nailed on the inside of the zine.
This proved objectionable on account of the nail-holes.

The next step was to make the slide-strips at the sides also of metal,
and to accomplish this many experiments were tried, and finally
arrangements were made with a firm in Philadelphia engaged in manu-
facturing corrugated iron. It was necessary for the Museum to have
especially constructed a set of dies and rolls for rolling the metal into
the desired shape (PI. 7, fig. 1), and also to import Florence tin of extra-
ordinary thickness, the kind ordinarily used in the United States not
being sufficiently strong. This experiment proved satisfactory, and
150 cases of this type have been for four years in use in the Museum,
and have stood the test of wear. The only objections arise from the
slight roughness where the sheets of tin are joined together, which is not
serious, and the fact that the outer ends of the metal ridges, which
were of course hollow, had a tendency to bend when the drawers were
drawn so far as to make a strong leverage upon the points. This, how-
ever, has been satisfactorily remedied by the use of triangular plugs
of hard wood, technically called “dutchmen,” which are driven into
the openings.

Out of these experiments still another form of storage case resulted, in
which the metal was placed outside of the woodwork instead of inside,
being soldered upon the outside of a substantial framework of wood,
while the strips upon the inside were of wood arranged in a new Way.

Instead of separate triangular strips, 8-inch boards of oak or ash, one-
halfinch in thickness, are glued and nailed close together upon the sides
of these strips. In these boards are worked at intervals of every half
inch grooves one-half inch in width and about one-half inch in depth.
(Pl. 7, fig. 2.) The sides of the case are thus provided with a series
of parallel, horizontal grooves separated by half-inch bars, which
represent the triangular strips formerly described. To correspond to
these grooves a new device is employed for the support of the trays.
Instead of the strip which was formerly nailed at the side, the lower edge
of the tray projects with a triangular section beyond the plane of the
sides, as Shown in the diagram. (PI. 8, fig. 1.) This device is appli-
cable to light drawers not over 4 inches in depth. The drawer of the
old type, however, works advantageously in the same groove.

In both the metal-lined and metal-covered cases, as just described, a
very effective means of closing the front is secured by the use of rub-
ber tubing fastened in a groove in the zine-covered front edges of the
opening, against which a solid wooden door is firmly pressed by means
of a special form of combined bolt and lock, as shown in the acecom-
panying sketch.* (Fig. 1.)

Many improvements have been made in the past ten years, not only
in the sliding mechanism, but also in the methods of making the cases
moth and dust-proof.

One moth-proof case is a modification of the form originally devised
by Mr. William Brewster, of Cambridge, Mass.

The most perfect example of the moth-proof case which has been pro-
duced, is one especially modified from designs by Mr. J. S. Goldsmith,
for the reception of the type specimens in the mammal collection. This
case contains 8 drawers, 35 by 4 feet. Most of the drawers are 2 inches
deep, but others of any required depth can be used. The drawers are
of pine and have a solid wooden bottom, although one of three-ply
veneer would doubtless be an improvement. The system of construction
is that already described, with grooved wooden boards inside of a zine
cover. The drawers are provided with the ordinary triangular slide-
strips. The frame of the case which supports the slide-racks inside is
covered with zine outside, and is of pine 3 inches wide and seven-eighths
of an inch thick. The frame is covered with sheet-zine, weighing 16
onnces to the square yard. The zine-covered case, which is 38 inches
long, 51 inches wide, 31? inches high, is then placed in a case of hard
wood, whose dimensions in the clear inside are 2 inches longer and 2
inches higher than the case, which, when pushed into place, fits against
the back of the wooden case—the front edge of which projects about 34
inches beyond the outer edgeof the zine case—but is separated by seven-
eighths of an inch from its sides, bottom, and top. This space is filled
by pine strips, 3 inches in width and seven-eighths of an inch in thick-

*The text figures have been grouped into plates, following Plate 57.

ness, which are necessary for use in connection with the device for dust-
proofing.

The device for dust-proofing is dependent upon a double door and a
double system of rubber tubing. The system by which the double
doors are made is shown in the accompanying sketch (Fig. 2). These
doors are separated by an air space of 2 inches. The inner one is of
soft wood, paneled, and lined with zinc. The outer one is of hard wood,
paneled. The pressure against the rubber tubing, which is necessary
for absolute tightness, is secured by three sets of stubs and plates, at
the bottom (Fig. 5), and by two bolts, one in each corner above. These
are so Shaped that, when pressed, they have the effect of wedges (Fig. 4).

The outer door has the same system of stubs and plates, and a rod
lock of the ordinary type, fitted with a Yale key for the greater security
of the precious contents.

This case has been used for some months and has proved thoroughly
satisfactory, being practically air-tight, while its construction is’ such
that it will doubtless be as good fifty years hence as it is now.

Improvements have also been effected in the construction of the unit
drawers. At first these were joined at the corners by dovetailing.
This proved unsatisfactory, and the device of ‘ fingering ” was substi-

tuted. (PI. 8, fig. 2.) The fingered corners have been secured in

two ways, one by wooden dowels, the other by the ordinary process of
gluing. The doweled trays were exceedingly strong and satisfactory,
but if has been more convenient to use the other method and this is
now exclusively employed.

The bottoms, which are inserted in grooves about a quarter of an inch
from the bottom of the tray, are of three kinds:

(1) Of pineor of poplar, seven-eighths of an inch in thickness, for the
minerals and heavy specimens and three-eighths of an inch for light
specimens.

(2) Of ‘‘ three-ply veneer,” such as is used for the seats of chairs and
for the lining of cars and in other kinds of cabinetwork. These are
made of three layers of very thin, straight-grained wood glued together,
the central layer being of pine, the outer layers of ash, maple, or other
hard wood. These layers are so adjusted that the grain of the
center layer runs at right angles with that of the two outer layers.
They are solidly glued together under heavy pressure, the thickness
of the whole not exceeding a quarter of aninch. Although somewhat
more expensive than the plain wooden bottoms, they are stronger and
very much lighter and have the positive advantage of never cracking
or shrinking. The plain bettoms, it has been found, often shrink away
from their attachments to the sides of the drawer, even when thoroughly
kiln-dried lumber is used. Many thousands of “three-ply” bottoms
are in use, and they have satisfactorily stood the test of hard use for
ten years or more.

(3) Of paper. This form of bottom grew out of the desire for a
lighter and cheaper form of tray.* In the early storage cases deep
drawers were used, chiefly for reasons of economy, and small pasteboard-
bottomed trays, four of which covered the bottom of a unit drawer,
were used to contain birdskins and other small objects, these being
piled one above another in several layers. This was inconvenient and
detrimental to the specimens, and the real desideratum proved to be a
light shallow drawer of moderate cost, in which specimens could be
stored in a single layer. It should be said that the old system of deep
drawers was also in part the outgrowth of the necessity for making
the drawers themselves dust and moth proof. This was in the days
before air-tight cases had been developed, and skins of birds and mam-
mals were kept in glass-covered boxes, similar to the unit box. The
developmentof the light paper-bottom tray was simultaneous with that
of the moth-proof case.

In the search for a light and durable drawer of this kind many
experiments were made. The first stage was that of binders’ board,
then followed tin, then light three-ply veneering, then wire-gauze coy-
ered with paper, then cotton cloth painted, then cotton cloth covered
with paper, and finally the bottom made of paper alone. These bot-
toms are made only in the Museum workshops, it never having been
found possible to get a contractor sufficiently careful to furnish sat-
isfactory drawers. The materials used and the process employed are
as follows:

Materials—(1) Brown manila paper, 150 pounds to the ream. The
size of each sheet (from which two bottoms are made) is 40 by 48 inches;
(2) common flour paste; (3) brown shellac of commerce, dissolved in
alcohol.

Tools.—The tools are a bookbinder’s knife, a broad, flat paste brush,
a stout wooden stretcher, 27 by 33 inches, which is the size of the bot-
tom before it is trimmed. This stretcher is of pine, at least 14 inches
in thickness, in order to resist the strain of the shrinkage of the paper
when drying. There should be, of course, a considerable number of
these stretchers (PI. 9, fig. 1).

The process.—A sheet of paper is pasted to the large wooden stretcher,

extreme care being taken to avoid wrinkling, and is then set aside to
dry for a half hour or more. It is then taken up again, and another
sheet is pasted to it, after which it is again set aside to dry. This is
repeated until four or five thicknesses of paper have been joined
together, five thicknesses being necessary for the heaviest drawers.
Each sheet, before being pasted on, is thoroughly soaked in water. The
combined sheets thus forming the bottom of the drawer are then allowed
to dry for twelve to twenty-four hours, according to the moisture of the
atmosphere. The inside of the bottom of the drawer is then thoroughly
coated with shellac. Then, without removing the sheets of paper from
the stretcher, they are tacked to the bottom of the frame of the drawer
with 6-ounce Swedish tacks, placed about a quarter of an inch apart
(Pl. 9, fig. 2). Then another sheet of paper is pasted over, thus coy-
ering the heads of the tacks. This not only improves the appearance
of the bottom, but prevents the tacks from drawing out. Then the
bottom is also thoroughly shellacked, and the edges of the paper
trimmed close to the edge of the drawer, which is then complete. The
weight of the lightest 24 by 30-inch drawers for small bird skins, 2
inches in depth, is about 514 ounces, and the cost is about 25 cents.

The ordinary pine storage drawer, 3 inches in depth, costs on the
average about 50 cents; a 4-inch drawer, 55 cents; a 5-inch drawer,
60 cents, and so on in preportion. This, of course, refers to prices
where a large number of them are made by machinery at the same time.

Another feature in our cases, peculiar to this Museum, it is believed,
is that every case, no matter how large, is placed upon rollers, or can
be lifted from the floor on adjustable rollers of various forms. Even
the long wall cases, 9 feet in height, which have been recently con-
structed, are made in sections, so that they can be moved without the
assistance of carpenters.

-The largest case in the Museum—that containing the group of bufta-
loes—is undoubtedly the largest movable show case in the world. Itis
16 feet 6 inches by 12 feet 53 inches by 11 feet 1% inches in dimensions,
and the weight of the case, with its contents, is about 9,300 pounds. This
is supported on 10 rollers, which are of the kind used on the heaviest
rolling platforms in warehouses, and are made of iron, the wheels being
43 inches in diameter, with rims about 2 inches wide. They are of a
pattern called the ‘ anti-friction ” castors, the bearing of the axle being
upon an arrangement of several wheels. This case can be readily
moved from one end of the Museum to the other by eight men.

There are other cases almost as large, and still others—in the mineral
hall—much heavier in proportion to their size. The mineral storage
case, 8 feet 6 inches long, 4 feet 4 inches wide, and 3 feet 3 inches high,
filled with unit drawers, loaded with minerals, has an estimated weight
of 2,000 pounds. Such cases as these are supported on 4 or 6 anti-fric-
tion castors of the pattern and size just described, one at each corner,
and can be moved by four men.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a4

The ordinary lighter type of exhibition case is not provided with
independent rollers, but can be raised by wooden trucks with rubber
tires about 44 inches in diameter, and movable in every direction, like
furniture castors. There is an attachment of levers so accurately
adjusted that a case full of bottles can be moved from one end of the
building to the other without disturbing labels or specimens.

This system of trucks has been found of the greatest service in the
exposition work, in which the Museum is often called upon to take part,
since the cases can be arranged in cold or bad weather in sheltered,
warm rooms, and carried to their places on the floor.

Another form of case especially advantageous for exhibition work
is what is called the “knockdown” case, in which the parts are fast-
ened together by pins and escutcheons. These cases have all the per-
manence and strength of fixed cases, and can be put together and
taken apart with great celerity.

MOUNTINGS FOR INDIVIDUAL SPECIMENS.

One of the most convenient and ingenious devices is that invented
by Prof. Merrill for placing geological specimens, jars, and other similar
objects upon sloping shelves, in such a manner that both specimen and
label shall be easily seen, while at the same time resting on a level
surface; the objects are not in danger of sliding forward. This system
is shown in the accompanying illustration. (Fig. 5.)

In the plate referred to (PI. 10) the appearance of a number of speci-
mens thus arranged upon the shelves is shown, though not well. The
arrangement of this case is in many respects one of the most satisfac-
tory pieces of installation which has ever been effected in the National
Museum.

Each block or tablet has tacked to its front a small strip of tin, so
bent as to receive and hold the label and to allow its ready removal
when desired. This is painted the same color as the block, and is
thereby rendered quite inconspicuous. To prevent the sliding of the
specimens of the front row, which, in order to bring them below the
level of those in the back row, are without blocks, a continuous strip
of tin is tacked along the front edge of the shelf, bent as shown in the
cut. The full width of the strip is the average width of the labels. In
this series it is about one inch. The elevation of the back edge, which
is to check the sliding of the specimens, is from one-eighth to one-fourth
inch, while the front edge is folded over just sufficient to hold the label
in place, as before.

Among the other devices which have recently been adopted in the
department of geology two may be mentioned:

The first is the curator’s plan for showing the appearance of a cave by
setting up in its natural position a miniature grotto, with diminutive
stalactites and stalagmites, which he was so fortunate as to secure from
the Marengo Cave, in Indiana (PI. 11), placing at the sides of the
oo REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

case mirrors by whose reflections the general effect of an extended
miniature cave is produced. This is a very effective way of mount-
ing exhibits, and the use of the mirrors seems to be an aid to the imagi-
nation of visitors, especially to young people who have never seen a
cavern.

Another is for storing the great series of microscope slides of thin
sections of rocks which belongs to this department. It is thus deseribed
by Prof. Merrill:

As it happened, we had in stock a number of pasteboard boxes, some 93 mm. wide,
143 mm. long, and 48 wm. deep, all inside measurements. The dimensions of our
standard slide are 48 by 28 mm. By means of two wooden partitions some 3 mm.
thick, running lengthwise, each box was divided into three equal compartments, the
partitions being held in place by glue reinforced by two small tacks at each end.
Heavy manila wrapping paper, such as we also had in stock, was then cut into
strips 25 mm. wideand as long as the sheet of paper would allow, in this case about
7 feet. These strips were then bent into a series of folds, as shown in the accom-
panying illustration, the apices being rounded, not pinched flat. If carefully done,
the folds when crowded gently together act as a spring. Twoof these folded strips
were then placed lengthwise in each compartment, and the slides introduced, stand-
ing en end, between the folds at the top. A box as thus prepared readily holds 3
rows of 50 slides in a row, or 150 altogether.

Each slide is separated from its neighbor in the same row by a double thickness
of manila paper, which, owing to its manner of folding, acts as a spring, and avoids
all possible danger of breakage. When all the compartments are filled, the space
between the tops of theslides in any row is but about 2 mm., but there is, neverthe- —
less, no difficulty in removing a slide or in getting at it to read the label without
removal, since, owing to the yielding nature of the paper, the top may be readily
drawn apart. In this respect the box offers a great advantage over those with rigid
compartments, such as are commonly in use. The first box was made merely as an
experiment. It proved so satisfactory that, for the time being at least, it is the form
adopted for storing the several thousand slides forming the museum collections.

I have attempted to show the arrangement as above described in the accompany-
ing drawing (Fig. 6). In reality the slides are held much more firmly than indi-
cated, since the paper bulges and comes against both the front and back of the

likely strike the reader that a better material than paper might be found. I can
only state that after considerable experimenting the paper was, all things consid-
ered, found most satisfactory. *

The adoption of unglazed tiles, instead of wooden or paper blocks,
to support minerals, shells, and other small objects, is being considered,
and experiments, the result of which will be announced later, are being
made by Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the Paleontological Department.
These tiles are rectangular, and of a soft buff color, corresponding
closely to one of the standard shades used in the interior of our cases.

and unsightly pasteboard tray, usually white, which is so often seen in
collections of shells, minerals, and fossils. It is particularly well
suited for coins and other single objects which it is desired to dig-
nify by placing on a special mount with a pleasing back-ground.

The tray of sheet iron used in the Dresden Museum is much stronger
than the pasteboard tray customarily used in other museums, and for
large study collections is undoubtedly preferable, although less desir-
able for exhibition purposes.

For very precious objects, such as small bronzes, ivory carvings, and
small examples of metal-work, which lie flat upon the shelves, or at the
bottom of table case, our curators occasionally use cushions of maroon
or dark blue plush, bound with silk cord; this, however, is a refine-
ment in installation which is not recommended for use except in very
special cases, as when it is desired to install a loan or gift collection
very elaborately, or when the objects exhibited are of the greatest
intrinsic worth. Such cushions may be used to excellent advantage
on glass shelves.

EXHIBITION JARS.

The necessity for rectangular jars for the exhibition of alcoholic
preparations has long been felt, and for many years our people have
been in conference with the glass-blowers concerning them; but the
difficulties in the way of securing satisfactory results seem almost
insuperable,

The most desirable form of rectangular jar—one with a wide aperture
of the “salt mouth” pattern—seems to be unobtainable. This is to be
regretted, since a jar which can be closed with a circular ground-glass
stopper is the most convenient for museum purposes. The plan of a
round opening closed by a stopper was proposed, and experiments
were made for improving the ordinary type of anatomical receptacle,
long in use in this country as well as in Europe, in which the large
opening at the top is closed by a flat plate. Such receptacles as this
have been used for a number of years in the Museum of Comparative
Zoology and in the Army Medical Museum, and they have also long
been in use in Europe, both for round and rectangular vessels.

A modification of this device, by Mr. James E. Benedict, is deseribed
as follows: . .

The lip is ground to a perfect plane, and the opening, closed by a
sheet of glass annointed with vaseline, is held in place by a cover which
just completes the rectangular shape of the jar, its edges filling the
shoulder, which is blown on the outer margin of the top of the jar, as
Shown in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 7). This eap is sufficiently
heavy to hold the cover plate in place, and it takes the place of
the unsightly mechanical clamps of the jar customarily used in
museums for anatomical preparations. The arrangement is thor-
oughly satisfactory for exhibition purposes, and the cover being made

of common window glass, which is somewhat irregular in its surfaces,
enough small openings occur around the edges for the escape of
gases, so that the somewhat unsightly vent-hole, usually made in
hermetically sealed jars to allow the escape of gas and the introdue-
tion of alcohol without removing the luting, is dispensed with.

The most serious difficulty, however, has not been in regard to the
cover, but rather in securing at the front of the jar a face sufficiently
smooth and well polished to display the specimens clearly and without
distortion. Some of the samples made for us by the glass manufac-
turers had this surface polished on the buffing wheel; but the grinding
was not sufficient to remove the inequalities in the glass, and the cor-
ners, furthermore, are not rectangular, but rounded to such a degree
as to cause some distortion of the specimens. Besides this, these are
irreguar and unsightly, and even to secure this imperfect result the
glass is so thick that its transparency is somewhat impaired. This
method of polishing the front surface of the receptacle has been used
also in Europe. It is an alleviation but not a remedy for the evil,
and, furthermore, is exceedingly expensive and beyond the reach of
a museum which has to provide for a large number of wet prepara-
tions. Jars of this type, made in Edinburgh, are used in the Army
Medical Museum in Washington. The cost of these jars, 9 by 12 inches,
at the factory was about $105 a dozen. A firm in this country tried te
produce jars somewhat similar, but was unable to make them at this
price.

Every important factory in the United States which would under-
take work of this class has been consulted, and Mr. Benedict was
sent on a special mission to visit them and study in person the possi-
bilities. He soon became satisfied that in the present state of the
glass-blowing industry nothing more can be done with blown jars,
and began investigations in another direction.

Experiments have been made by Mr. Benedict with a view to the
possibility of building receptacles out of plate glass. Something of this
kind had already been tried in Germany, with receptacles in metal
frames, and constructed on the principle of an aquarium tank. The
plan adopted here has been to dispense with entirely metal, and
to use silicate cements which are insoluble in preservative fluids, and
which unite so closely with the glass as to become, practically, a part of
it. The recipes for these cements used are, unfortunately, the property
of private individuals. In the process of manufacture the recepta-
cles are exposed toa heat of 550° F. for several hours. It is impossible
at the time of writing to say with certainty that these experiments have
been successful, although one large jar has been filled with alcohol and
specimens for eleven months and twelve others for six months. In jars
of this particular form the top is made of two pieces of plate glass, the
lower one being smaller, and so attached to the other as to form a
shoulder all around; and the cover thus formed is luted to the opening

with vaseline. The junction thus formed is so perfect that it is neces-
sary to have a vent-hole in the top, though much smaller than is custom-
ary, it being only one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter, Jars made in
this way, of the size already alluded to as costing more than $100 a
dozen, can certainly be had for a little more than half the price and, if
they prove permanent, will be in every respect better.

Photographs have been made from jars filled with alcohol and speci-
mens, and the peculiarities of the two systems are shown without dis-
tortion or exaggeration in the accompanying plates (Pls. 13 and 14).

A small built-up jar, madein Germany, has been in use in the Army
Medical Museum and elsewhere as an accessory to the microscope.
These jars will hold all liquids and acids used in microscopic work,
and careful examination shows that the cement used is subjected to a
vitrifying heat. The use of hot water in the jars breaks them in the
corners, Which make natural lines of cleavage. Just how large a jar
can be made in this way we have no information, but some of the
experiments tried by us demonstrate that they are not as reliable as
those made with cemented corners.

A convenient way of mounting specimens for the rectangular jars is
shown in fig. 8. The fish or other object to be mounted is fastened to
a pane of common window glass by meaus of threads passed through
the object, ordinarily by the use of a surgeon’s needle. These are
drawn through holes bored in the glass at the proper places, and
fastened by breaking off a soft wooden peg in the hole, biting and fas-
tening the thread in place. The holes are readily bored by aid of a
solution of turpentine and camphor used as a lubricant, and asmall file
as a drill, held in a small drilling machine. Any jeweler’s supply store
can furnish the requisite material.

THE PREPARATION OF LABELS.

The preparation of labels is one of the most difficult tasks of the
museum man. The selection of the descriptive matter to be printed
requires the best of judgment and the widest and most accurate
information; while to determine the form and size of the different
labels in a series, and to secure the best typographic effect, is equally
difficult, and requires abilities of quite a different order.

A label may contain a vast amount of exact and valuable informa-
tion, and yet, by reason of faulty literary and typographic arrange-
ment, have as little significance and value as a piece of blank paper.

Before a specialist is prepared to label a collection he must be a
complete master of the subject which the collection is intended to illus-
trate. After he has written the series of labels, if the collection is
complete, he will have the material under control which would enabie
him to write a very complete book of reference upon the subject.

No task is more exacting than label writing. Not only is it impossi-
ble to conceal any lack of precise knowledge, but the information must
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

be conveyed in a terse, concise, and definite phraseology, such as is
not demanded in any other class of writing, unless it may be the prepa-
ration of definitions for a dictionary. He who writes definitions for a
dictionary, however, has usually the advantage of having before him
numerous other definitions of the same term, which he needs only to
collate and rearrange. A good descriptive label, furthermore, should
do something more than impart information. It should be so phrased
as to excite the interest of the person who is examining the specimen
to which it is attached; to call his attention to the points which it is
most important that he should observe; to give him the information
which he most needs while looking at, the specimen, and to refer him
to the books by means of which he can, if so disposed, Jearn all that is
known upon the subject illustrated.

The labels describing the specimens in a collection are intended to
take the place of the curator of the collection when it is impossible for
him to personally exhibit the objects and explain their meaning.
When collections were small and visitors were few, the curator or
owner of a cabinet was accustomed, in person, to conduct visitors
among the cases, to take the specimens in his hand, to tell their names
and where they came from, to indicate features of special interest, and
to answer questions.

This was in some respects an ideal way, when the curator was a man
of wide knowledge and so much of an enthusiast that he took pleasure
in talking without limit. The method was not without defects, how-
ever, since the lecturer (for such he was, in fact) selected for exhibi-
tion a limited number of objects which interested him, or which he
supposed might interest the visitors, and gave the latter no chance for
selection. Furthermore, the arrangement could not be such as to con-
vey a sequence of ideas, such as a selected and well-labeled series of
specimens can do, and the spoken descriptions, being as a rule full of
unfamiliar words, were not remembered. The printed label of to-day
may be read over again and again, and is often copied into the visitor’s
notebook. Again, under the old system, examining a collection was
looked upon rather in the light of amusement than of study, and what
might have been possible in the way of instruction was rarely
attempted.

In these days, when the curator attempts verbal instruction, itis by
means of a lecture delivered in the Museum lecture hall, or, if a floor-
lecture, among the cases, surrounded by scores or hundreds of audi-
tors, who may either take notes or find the substance of the lecture in
some syllabus or printed text-book.

While one visitor might listen to the Museum lectures, tens of
thousands pass through the halls without a guide. They must depend
entirely upon the labels for information; for guidebooks, if such have
been printed, are rarely bought, still more rarely used in the presence
of the specimens, and, though often taken home with the intention of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. od

studying them, are only in the rarest instances ever opened after their
purchaser has left the Museum. :

The function of the label, then, is a most important one, since it is
practically only through the aid of the labels that visitors derive any
benefit whatever from a visit to a museum.

What has already been said indicates in a general way the oftice of
the descriptive label, and may be expressed more concisely as follows :

The label must—

(1) Tell the name of the object; its exact and technical name always,
and if there be one, its common name.

(2) It must call attention to the features which it is important for
the visitor to notice.

(3) It must explain its meaning and its relations to the other objects
in the series. If it accompanies a natural history specimen, it should
explain its geographical distribution, which, if possible, should be
plotted on a small map, forming part of the label, and mentioning
peculiarities of structure or habit.*

If an ethnological object, then its uses and construction should be
explained, its materials named if they are not obvious, and supple-
mentary information given by means of pictures ; and, where pictures
are better than words, these may be substituted.

(4) The exact locality, date of collection, and source of the specimen
exibited should be mentioned.

(5) For the convenience of visitors it is well, in many cases, to give
the dimensions or weight of the specimen.

The art of label writing is in its infancy, and there are doubtless pos-
sibilities of educational results through the agency of labels and speci-
meus which are not as yet at all understood. It is clear, however, that
the advice of the negro cook in regard to making soup applies equally
well toa good label; to wit, that much more depends on what you leave
out than on what you put in. The value of this method of instruction
is perhaps better understood by the most advanced writers of school
text-books and dictionaries than even by the average museum worker,

In Dr. Edward Eggleston’s new “School History of the United States,”
engravings are plentifully interspersed through the text, as well as in
the margins,—portraits, pictures of historical localities, buildings, cos-
tumes, and archeological objects:—and each of these has a label of the
museum type, surrounded by rules, and separated from the text with
which it has usually only incidental relationship. The originals which
are thus illustrated, if brought together would make an admirable
~ We have used in the National Museum, in years gone by, labels of diftierent
colors to indicate geographical sources, and have also used for the same purpose
labels with printed borders of different colors. This, however, has long since been
~ abandoned as cumbersome and impracticable. In most cases a word upon the label
is sufficient to convey this idea. But when it is desired to convey fuller information,

38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

museum of American history, and the book itself could hardly be
improved upon as a handbook to such a collection.

The modern illustrated dictionary owes much of its success to the
adoption of museum methods, due, perhaps, to the fact that so many
men, trained in museum work, have been engaged upon the preparation
of the latest American publications of this kind, the Century Dietion-
ary and the more recently published Standard Dictionary. These
works impart instruction by methods very similar to those in use in
museums, except that they are placed much at a disadvantage by reason
of their alphabetical arrangement.

There is, of course, one respect in which the museum exhibition. case
has the advantage over the lecturer, who can only present one subject
at a time, or over the writer of books, who is prevented by the size
of his pages from bringing a large number of ideas into view at once.
This ee has been in part overcome by the editor of the Standard
Dictionary, in the large plates, where are shown, in one case all the
principal v eae of precious stones; in another plate, all the races of
the domesticated dog, and in another, the badges of orders of chivalry.
Even this, however, is far from reaching the possibility possessed by
the Museum (with its broad expanses of exhibition cases) of showing a
large number of objects so arranged as to exhibit their mutual relation-
ship, and so labeled as to explain the method of their arrangement.

As has already been said, the size and typography of the label are of
the greatest importance. The best written label may be ruined by the
printer. Not only must the letters be large enough to be legible from
the customary point of view, but the type must be pleasing in form,
and so arranged as to lead the eye of the reader with pleasure from
one line to another, and so broken into paragraphs as to separate from
each other the topies discussed.

furthermore, a system of subordinate sizes of type is essential, so
that the most important facts will first meet the eye. In many of the
labels shown in the accompanying illustrations type of four or five dif-
ferent sizes is used, the largest giving the name of the object, the next
size the name of locality and donor, the next its distribution, and so on,
much in the order of importance of the topics already proposed, while
the least essential illustrative matter at the bottom of the label is placed
in the smallest type. The theory is that the largest type should give
the information desired by the greatest number of visitors—by every
one; the next size, that needed by those who are studying the collection
in a more leisurely way, and so on.

Too much can not be said of the necessity of breaking the descrip-
tive matter into short paragraphs, which should never be more than
half a square in length. Where a label of great width is printed, it is
our experience that it is better to arrange the matter in two columns,
as is shown in one of the accompanying plates, rather than to weary
the eye by requiring it to follow back and fro across the ecard.

It formed an important article ot food for the early navigators and

was taken in great numbers at its breeding places. Systematic slaugh-
ter of the bird for its Aesh and feathers caused the extermination of
the Great Auk about 1840.

Descended from an ancient Scotch family of noble blood.
Educated at the University of Edinburgh (M.A., 1605), and
in Law at Paris and Bruges; a man of wealth and a Royalist,
resident at Hawthornden, except from 1625-30, when travel-
ling on the Continent.

A Scotch poet of the Spenserian school,—author, among
other works, of Zeares on the Death of Melades, 1613;
Poems, 1616; Fatth Feasting, 1617; Flowers of Sion and
The Cypresse Grove, 1623; and some forgotten historical
and political writings.

“DRUMMOND was essentially a follower of Spenser, delighting in the descrip-
tion of outer nature, but, amid all his sensuousness, and even in those lines most
conspicudusly laden with lustrous beauty, there is a dash of melancholy thought-
fulness—a tendency deepened by the death of his first love. He was so success-
ful as a writer ot sonnets that he was called ‘the Scottish Petrarch,’ and his
sonnets are still ranked immediately after Shakespeare’s, Milton’s and Words-
worth’s. His poems are distinguished by pensive beauty, sweetness of versifica-

Cybele or Rhea was called the “Great-Mother of the Gods.” The original home
of her worship was in Phrygia, (Asia Minor), in the district afterwards known as Galatia.
Her priests were called Corybantes, and her festivals were celebrated with wild dances,
and orgiastic excesses amid the resounding music of drums and cymbals. From Asia
her worship came to Greece, and at Athens she had a temple called the Metroun, the
temple of the great mother.

In Rome her worship was introduced during the second Punic war in 204 B. C.
A yearly festival was instituted in her honor (April 2-4) called the Mega/esza, and under
the empire another in March, which was celebrated with the observance of mourning
followed by the most extravagant joy. In the second century A. D. the festivals 7au-
robolia and Crrobolia were added.

Among the ceremonies observed in these iestivals was a kind of baptism with the
blood of bulls and rams killed in sacrifice, with the object of cleansing and bringing
about a new birth The oak and the pine, as also the lion were sacred to her. She
was supposed to traverse the mountains riding on a lion, or in a chariot drawn by lions.
She 1s usually represented enthroned between lions, with a diadem on her head, and a

SELENITE CRYSTALS.— From cave in
what is locally known as the South Wash, in

Wayne County, Utah. 60,881.
Received from J. E. TALMaGE, 1893.

The crystals occur in a cave which is inclosed by a
thick shell forming a mound which stands in relief ona
hillside as shown in the photograph. The crystals vary
greatly in size and weight, some being over four feet
long. Owing to the vandalism of visitors, it has been
found necessary to remove the finest specimens to the
Deseret, Museum, at Salt Lake City, to prevent their com-
plete destruction (See Science, Feb. 17, 1893.)

CORRODED STALACTITE.—The specimen is
partially dissolved by the corroding action of water
from the roof. It illustrates one of the latest stages
in the life history of a cave. The lime in the over-
lying roof has been so far removed that the water
percolating though it is still acid and attacks the
material of the stalactites as it drips over them.

ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY AND ART

CosTUME OF THE MISERICORDIA OF TUSCANY

THIs CosTUME consists of a simple hooded cassock
of black, worn over ordinary citizen’s dress, and a
broad brimmed felt hat, used in outdoor service.

SIENA, 1892. 153,893.
Collected by G. BRown GOooDE.

The FRATERNITY OF THE MISERICORDIA (Pia Arcicon-
SJraternita de Santa Maria della Misericordia) 1s a great society, with
branches in Siena, Florence, Pisa, and the other cities and towns of Tuscany,
which has for its sole object the alleviation of suffering and the furtherance
of all works of benevolence. Its most striking characteristic 1s that its
active work is carried on by its members in person, and not by paid deputies.
On its rolls are found the names of a large proportion of the adult males
of the community, without regard to rank or wealth. A certain number
of these are assigned to duty for each day in the year, and are expected
to respond at once to any call from the officer of the day, and while on
duty are under strict discipline.

The personal relationship of the wealthy and the powerful to the
charitable work of the community is productive of much good. All dis-
tinctions of rank are ignored in the organization, and to this end a costume
of the cheapest material is used, to disguise figure and face, and members
while on’ duty neither speak nor are spoken to, except as a matter of
necessity. The money needed for the work is obtained by the mute appeals
of the members in public places and at the doors of churches, and ‘from
the fees of membership. Each local society has its chapel for funeral
services, and all funerals with but few exceptions, are conducted by this
organization, the coffin being borne by its members in their peculiar dress.

One of the oldest of these societies, that to which the costume exhibited belongs, is that of Siena.
This was founded at the end of the fourteenth century by Bernardino Albizzeschi (San Bernardino) as a
society to perform works of mercy and to aid prisoners. In 1564 a statute prescribed the manner in which
their charitable offices might be exercised. It was suppressed in the time of Leopold I, and resuscitated
by royal permission in 1794. In 1829 1t was reorganized upon the model of those in Pisa and Florence,
and in 1862 by popular subscription an endowment of 155,000 lira ($31,000) was secured, which has since
been increased by other donations. Its membership is very large, including in a city of fifty thousand
inhabitants, about three thousand active members.

Its scope includes everything which comes within the term charity—the relief of those stricken by
misfortune of any kind at any time or place. Owing to the precipitous character of many of the streets,
horses are comparatively few in Siena, and sick people, as well as coffins, must be carried upon men's
shoulders. Invalids are taken by them to the Royal Hospital, three miles from the city, and they7have
control of an extensive cemetery, in which nearly all tnterments are made. A group of members ts organ-
zed under the name of visitors to the sick (Conzsttaturt Infermicrt). “‘Vhey render aid to the ill at
home, supplying them with beds, underclothing, bandayes, broths, easy chairs, trusses, and watchers or
Nurses at might. In summer the Society dispenses nimeral water for use in baths, and when necessary,
keeps open a room for vaccination and dispenses the vaccine matter throughout the city and the surrounding
country. In the case of an accident of any kind, a squad of members is upon the spot to render service,
in other Communities expected from the police and board of health.

‘The administration is in the hands of a brother called the Prowveditore, who presides at the neet-
ings of the board of management, the A/agitratv, composed of twelve brothers called Conservatort,
and also those of the council, composed of eighty councillors (Consighert). A full financial report is
printed cach year. ‘Ihe Society has its house, in which 1s not only a chapel, but a vast warehouse for the
accessories of their work—litters and surgical applances,—and a great room, surrounded by cupboards, in
which the cassocks of the members are kept ready to be put on when they are hastily summoned to duty
from their places of business.

‘The officers of the Society are an inspector (/sfeffore), who controls the public and private services; a
brother deputy (Deputato), in charge of the Convalescent’s Home ; a sec retary ( Cancellrere-Sesreta:tv), Who
supervises the business, archives and correspondence ; a treasurer ( Camaréingv), and a steward (Massiro)¢
who has charge of all linen, furniture, and other property in the warehouse. ‘There are fifty-two officers of
the guard, who in turn, day by day throughout the year, supervise the public services, and sometimes as
many as three hundred of the members are in active duty in a single day, under the charge of one of these
officers. All officers serve gratuitously except the secretary, a physician, two priests, two servants and a
letter-carrier.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. oo

Labels, as a rule, seem to be most satisfactory when nearly square,
or with the height less than the width.

The relationship of the objects in a series to each other may usually
be indicated by the size of the labels, which should be uniform for
objects of the same general character in the same case. When a devi.
ation from this ruleis necessary, if the size of the type remains the
Same, more space may be obtained either by slight widening or slight
lengthening; butin the same series we must always lengthen or always
widen. Classification labels, which are placed, unattached, among the
specimens, increase in size with the importance of their grade in the
plan of classification, as is shown in the family labels illustrated.

There are limits to the possibilities of making labels speak by their
size. An object on the top of a case, or on a pedestal, or in a case by
itself,is always regarded as ‘out of classification,” and its label arranged
solely with reference to its appearance or utility in the place where it
is to stand. It is also necessary to vary the size somewhat in the
same series, when, as in a long case of mammals, a small species and a
large one are placed side by side. Here, for «esthetic reasons, the rule
of uniformity is usually set aside.

Much attention has been given to the selection of type and color for
labels, it having been found that labels printed on white cardboard
become dirty or turn yellow, besides being dazzling and hard to read.
Many tints of cardboard which would otherwise be available may not
be used, because of their tendency to fade—objectionable in itself, and
doubly objectionable when it becomes necessary to put a fresh, bright
label by the side of one which has become faded in use. Almost every
sample of colored board which has been tried in the National Museum
has faded after a time. The most satisfactory has been one of greenish
gray. This is temporarily in use in the geological and mineralogical
collections, where a light gray color for the interior of the cases and
shelves seems preferable, and also in the collection of birds, which is
installed by preference in a somewhat dark apartment.

The standard label-board, however, is a rough-faced manila. The
color, being that natural to the fiber, is quite unchangeable. There is
no fading, little tendency to become dirty, and its soft, rich, brownish-
yellow tone sets off admirably the heavy black lines of the antique-faced
type which is used, and harmonizes well with the buffs and maroons
which are our favorite colors for case interiors. The material at first
used was a somewhat soft though thick paper, made specially for genus-
covers in the herbarium. This did not prove thoroughly satisfactory,
since the labels, unless very small, had to be glued or tacked to some
solid support to prevent their bending and winding, and even then the
corners frequently rolled.

We now have a special cardboard of the material just mentioned,
heavily pressed, very stiff, and durable, which, though its surface
lacks somewhat the desirable softness, proves very satistactory.*

*Samples of this board will be sent to any museum worker who may request if.
40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

It may be added that cartridge paper, such as is ordinarily used for
wall decoration, in any tint of gray or light brown, is an admirable
material for labels, especially large ones. It must, however, be glued
to a tablet. If this is made of dark wood with a bevel retreating from
the edge of the label, forming a dark border, the effect is very pleas-
ing. Labels thus prepared, and mounted upon metal rods, are used by

us for general classification labels in the interior of cases.

It is the plan in the National Museum to have a large label, glazed
and framed, at the top of each case, or in front of each panel. These
are printed on black or maroon paper in gold or silver letters.*

The labels in gold on black ave printed from large wooden type, and
are used to indicate the general system of classification of the cases
upon the floor. When it is desired to use outside labels, glazed and
framed, which are not in this general-classification series, we print with
heavy-faced type in black upon manila or cartridge paper, such as have
been already referred to, since the black upon yellow is more legible
with comparatively small type than the gold upon black.

The National Museum owes many most important lessons in the
matter of labeling and the interior fitting of cases to the Art Museum
at South Kensington. Their system was studied with the greatest care
by the writer in 1880 and during a residence of seven months at South
Kensington in 1883, and, as will be evident to anyone who knows their
system, its influence has been very great upon that in use in Washing-
ton.

In the accompanying illustrations (Pls. 15-26) are shown a number
of the forms of labels adopted in the National Museum. Others are
being developed from day to day; but it is thought advisable tb place
these upon record as an indication of what has already been accepted
as measurably good.

ADVANCES IN GENERAL INSTALLATION,

The map devised by Mr. Merrill to show the extent and location of
the great ice sheet in North America during the glacial period is
described further on in this report.

The synoptical collection of invertebrates prepared by Mr. Lucas also
marks a positive advance in methods of mounting and labeling, to say
nothing of the success attained in showing the structure of certain
representative forms. This work will be described in the report for
1894, and a mere mention must now suffice.

The accompanying illustrations (Pls. 27, 28, 29), however, tell the
story better than words can do.

We have adopted two ideas already well carried out in the British
Museum of Natural History, and original with its director, Sir William
Flower, to whom we are indebted for other ideas equally good, soon to

is applied before the size is dry. The nickel is unchangeable and very effective.

be materialized in Washington. One is the exhibit of skeletons of
man and horse (PI. 30), shown side by side, with the homologies of
the bones indicated by a parallel system of labeling, the other the
mounting of the races of domestic pigeons in one case upon a stand
in the form of a dovecote, the specimens being so arranged as to show
their relationship to each other and to the parent form, the rock dove.

A similar project is being worked out for the domestic fowl, but is
not yet in final shape.

Another advance is that effected by Mr. Lueas in showing, side by
side, all the principal variations of the vertebrate skull, the homologies
of the bones being indicated by a system of coloration modified from
that already in use in the Natural History Museum in Milan, Italy.

A minor feature which seems to add materially to the comfort and
convenience of many visitors is the reading table, a sketch of which
is here given as a substitute for a detailed description (Fig 9). There
are some thirty of these tables, one for each department, and about 500
books are thus placed at the service of visitors. The books on the tables
are text books, bibliographies, dictionaries, and standard works of refer-
ence, and each table is devoted to the subject illustrated by the special
collection in the midst of which it stands. In the rotunda is a book-
case containing cyclopedias, and visitors who desire fuller information
are at liberty to go to the Museum library, and thence, if need be, to the
sectional libraries in the curators’ laboratories.

It is pleasant to be able to say that although over a thousand vol-
umes are thus exposed without surveillance in the public halls, not
a Single volume has been stolen, though many of them have been * read
to death.”

TAXIDERMY IN THE MUSEUM.

Allusion has been made from time to time in the reports to the work
of the Museum preparators in preparing objects for exhibition or study,
and the time seems now to have come for a consideration of what has
been accomplished and how this has been done.

As early as 1875, when, by means of the appropriations for the exhibit
of the Museum at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, it became
for the first time possible to employ competent taxidermists, an effort
was made to secure the very best men available, and to have prepared
better specimens than were at that time to be found in any American
museum. Mr. Joseph Palmer and Mr. Julius Stoerzer, excellent work-
men of the old school, were the chief agents in the preparation of the
exhibit of mounted animals and casts shown in Philadelphia, and the
results, though, so far as accessories are concerned, far below the pres-
ent standards, were in many instances quite equal to what has since
been done, as is indicated by the accompanying plate of the group of
fur seals (P1.31). Their work was greatly admired, and the influence of
the movement then just beginning soon spread to other institutions.
42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

The ideals in the National Museum were as high then as at the pres-
ent time, and Professor Baird, himself a very skillful taxidermist, was
not only the best of eritics, but enthusiastic in the extreme upon the
whole subject. The time of preparation for the Philadelphia exhibition
was so short and the appropriations so limited, however, that it was
not possible at that time to accomplish the results desired.

In this same connection should be mentioned the very important
influence of Prof. Henry A. Ward, who, in the conduct of his natural
history establishment at Rochester, was always evidently actuated
quite as much by a love for natural history and the ambition to supply
good material to museums, as by the hope of profit, whieh was always
by him subordinated to higher ideals in a manner not very usual i
commercial establishments.

While the work from 1875 on was constantly advancing in Washing-
ton, and the antiquated and badly prepared specimens in the old col-
lection were being replaced as fast as possible by others as good as
could at that time be prepared, similar agencies were in activity in
Rochester, and under the influence of Prof. Ward a number of enthusi-
astic young men were brought together and employed in the various
branches of the work connected with the establishment. It was here
that, through the stimulus of association and in connection with the
immense work in preparing natural history specimens which was then
in progress, mental forces of another kind came into being; and here,
in 1879, and the years following, some very remarkable pieces of work
were accomplished, which for originality and strength far surpassed
anything hitherto attempted in America. Among these may be men-
tioned Hornaday’s groups of orangs, one of which is now in the
museum in New York, and another here in Washington. . These, though
lacking in the artistic repose -which characterizes some of the later pro-
ductions of himself and his pupils, were extremely spirited and had all
the qualities of good workmanship and permanence which could be
desired.

A series of animals of the Rocky Mountains, mounted by Mr. F. 8.
Webster to serve as models for the artist Bierstadt, and since destroyed
by fire, should also be mentioned in this connection. Work of this
kind demonstrated the triviality and false ideals of such ambitious
figure groups as those of Verreaux, of which certain examples had
reached this country and were up to that time greatly admired, and of
the work of the European school of mammal taxidermists in generat.
well typified in the celebrated Wurtemburg collection and in many of
the groups in the Liverpool Museum, It is not intended, however, to
disparage the very excellent work of Verreaux upon single specimens *

* A lion which, since 1870, has been displayed in the American Museum in New
York City, is perhaps the best in this country. The National Museum has a hyena
mounted by him which, though not one of his greatest works, is full of spirit.

mounted in attitudes of repose for case installation, nor is it intended
to ignore the wonderful work done under Paoio Savi for the University
of Pisa—work quite in the modern spirit, which the test of nearly a
century has shown to have all the qualities of good workmanship.* But
for the fact that these are’ buried in the midst of a poorly installed
collection in an inaccessible gallery in a small Italian city, possibly the
spirit of modern artistic taxidermy would not have remained so long
latent. The museum at Turin has also had excellent taxidermists in
its employ.

At Leyden also much good work was done, and the animals were
mounted in varied positions. The birds at Leyden afforded a striking
contrast to those in the Natural History Museum at Bremen. These
were mounted in fixed conventional attitudes, and since the museum
possessed an immense collection of birds, they were crowded together
side by side, heads toward the wall and tails projecting over the edges
of the shelves toward the spectator, so that they looked like horses in
a stable, viewed from the rear. This museum, as I saw it in 1880, was
an eloquent teacher of methods to be avoided. It is to be hoped that,
before now, most of these skins have been unmounted and placed in
drawers in a study series, and a reasonable exhibition series substi-
tuted.

Mr. John Hancock, of London, many years ago did excellent work,
combining artistic feeling with scientific accuracy, and Mr. E. T. Booth
somewhat later developed a marvelous collection of British birds in
his ‘Dyke Road Museum” at Brighton. These were mounted in life-
like attitudes in the midst of natural accessories, and were satisfactory
alike to artists and to naturalists. Following in the same course the
admirably mounted collection in the Town Museum at Leicester was
developed by Mr. Montagu Brown, and that in the British Museum of
Natural History under Dr. Giinther, beginning as early as 1880. On
this side of the Atlantic, as early as 1870, most excellent work of this
kind was done by Mr. Andrew Downes in his private cabinet in Hali-
fax, Nova Scotia.

The Society of American Taxidermists was organized March 24, 1880,
by Messrs. Hornaday, Lucas, Webster, Critchley, Jules Bailly (a pupil
of Verreaux), Martens, and Fraine, all of Rochester, and a number of
other taxidermists scattered through the country joined in the move-
ment. This society was the direct outgrowth of the aspirations of the
enthusiastic founders of the new American school, and had for its
object not only the improvement of taxidermy from the technical stand-
point, but the elevation and ennobling of the profession of taxidermy
and the establishment of loftier ideals for the work.

The intention was to hold annual exhibitions, to secure the award of

44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

prizes for the most meritorious advances, and to publish an annual
volume of Proceedings, devoted to the discussion of the principles
and methods of the art.

The ideals of the organization before very long developed to such a
degree that they could not be worked out to the best advantage in a
commercial establishment, and several members of the new school, hav-
ing found that their objects were thoroughly appreciated and their
efforts meeting with hearty support from the authorities of the U.S.
National Museum, began to look to Washington as a wider and more
promising field for their activities. In the National Museum, in the
meantime, constant progress had been made, especially in the work of
preparing casts and models in plaster. Some of the work prepared
for the International Fisheries Exhibitions in Berlin in 1880 and Lon-
don in 1883, would be regarded as admirable if done at the present time.

Soon after the reorganization of the National Museum in 1881 Mr.
W. T. Hornaday was appoiated chief taxidermist, and he was soon fol-
lowed to Washington by Mr. F. A. Lucas, who, though an accom-
plished taxidermist, had given especial attention to the mounting of
skeletons and anatomical preparations. Somewhat later came Mr. F.
S. Webster, and others of the Rochester group would also have been
added to the Museum staff but for our feeling of unwillingness to inter-
fere with the important establishment at Rochester by taking away so
many of its most competent men.

In the meantime the Society of American Taxidermists had been
steadily at work. It held three annual exhibitions (in Rochester, in
Boston, and in New York), and in 1884 another exhibition was held in
connection with the Cotton Centennial Exposition at New Orleans and
under the auspices of the National Museum. Three numbers of the
reports were published. Since 1884, however, the society has been
dormant. Perhaps its work had been accomplished. At all events,
its influence was strongly felt, not only among taxidermists but through
the larger and smaller museums of the country, and during the five
years of its existence a decided change in public opinion had been
etfected.

The necessity for the development of a great mounted collection of
mammals in the National Museum, and above all the execution of
the plan for preparing monumental groups of the animals which are
approaching extinction, mounted in natural attitudes and surrounded
by proper accessories, has given a very wide field for work in higher
taxidermy, and a number of young men from various parts of the
country sought admission to the Museum workshops, where they
received or completed their training. Among the most prominent of
these may be mentioned the late Jenness Richardson, who was for three
years in the Museum, and went in 1886 to become the chief taxidermist
of the Museum of Natural History in New York City, where he accom-

plished some very noteworthy pieces of work, especially in the mount-
ing of birds.

Mr. L. L. Dyche, now professor in the University of Kansas, also
passed several months here, and learned the methods which have
resulted in his excellent work upon large mammals shown in the
Kansas State building at the World’s Fair of 1893.

Mr. William Palmer, now chief taxidermist of the Museum, also
received his first training during these years, and began a career which
has resulted in the production of such remarkabie work as the groups
of Caribou, prepared especially for Chicago, which, in the judgment of
the writer, have not been surpassed anywhere, marking as they do the
highest attainment in the imitation of nature, with that combination
of life with perfect repose which is the supreme test of merit in tax-
idermy. Many other men have profited by work in our laboratories,
and are now scattered through the country, either attached to museums
or in private business as taxidermists.

The taxidermists previously attached to the Museum have produced
work in its way equal to that of their associates. The casts of reptiles,
fishes, and cetaceans made by Joseph Paimer are by universal admis-
sion unrivaled, and this perfection was reached under Prof. Baird’s
encouragement before the Society of Taxidermists began its work and
as early as 1876.

The bird work of Henry Marshall, though for the most part limited
to preparation of specimens for shelf installation, has not been sur-
passed. Mr. N. R. Wood, who came from Rochester in 1888, has pro-
duced noteworthy work in groups of birds, and is especially skillful
in the mounting of the various breeds of domestic fowl, which he has
done with such painstaking accuracy that they may well serve as
fixed standards in the development of the races of poultry. His work
in restoring hair to skins which have become bare, is worthy of the
most painstaking Oriental.

In the mounting of skeletons and anatomical preparations the high-
est standard of excellence has been aimed at, and it is believed that
there is no collection of mounted skeletons in the world which can
show more perfect pieces of work or a higher average grade of excel-
lence. Mr. Lucas, under whose direction this collection has grown up,
and who with his own hands prepared many of the most remarkable
specimens (Pls. 32 and 33), has become curator of the department
of comparative anatomy, but has transmitted the technical merits of
his methods to Mr. J. W. Scollick, whose work upon minute osteolog-
ical preparations is little short of marvelous.

It might be said that these words of commendation would be in better
taste coming from outside and written by one who has not been, in the
matter of sympathy, so closely associated with the development of the
ideals of the higher taxidermy and the furthering of their aeccomplish-
ment. This was in my mind when, a year ago, I requested Dr, R, W.
46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

Shufeldt, U.S. Army, who had recently published some articles on
taxidermy in “The Great Divide,” and who was alsoa judge of awards
in the department of taxidermy at the Columbian Exposition, to pre-
pare an article upon the modern museum taxidermy. It was the idea
that Dr. Shufeldt, not being attached to any museum, would be able to
examine critically and discuss the subject without prejudice, taking
into consideration all that has been done elsewhere as well asin Wash-
ington, and this he endeavored to do. The predominance of illustra-
tions taken from specimens in our Museum, as finally published, was
not intentional, but was due to the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory
photographs from other establishments. An effort was made to obtain
illustrations from the New York Museum and from the British Museum.*
The illustrations obtained from these sources by no means did justice to
the specimens illustrated, and the efforts to secure photographs of the
Savi groups in Pisa, and of the rhinoceros mounted for the Medici
collection in Florence three hundred years ago, were unsuccessful.

Dr. Shufeldt’s essay, which was published in the Museum report for
1892, has attracted much attention, especially abroad, and the Ameri-
can taxidermic work, the excellences of which are suggested rather than
fully depicted in the illustrations, has received much praise from those
who are not familiar with it, and, if one may predict, the paper will be
useful in still further raising the standard of museum taxidermy.

A special illustrated supplement to Natural Science was published
in England on the occasion of the meeting of the British Asscciation for
the Advancement of Science. This was entitled ‘‘ Taxidermy as a Fine
Art,” and was devoted not so much to a review of the Shufeidt article
as to critical comments upon the illustrations, of which a selection of
nine were reproduced. In closing his remarks the editor says:

In selecting the plates for this article we have paid but small attention to the
many beautiful illustrations of birds. In respect to bird groups our home museums

do not require much teaching, though even they have yet to learn that a bird can
be mounted in the most natural manner on an ordinary museum perch or stand. It

*Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe’s paper on ‘Ornithology at South Kensington,” in the
‘‘English Illustrated Magazine,” December, 1887, pp. 166-175, gives an excellent idea
of the British Museum groups, though the illustrations, not being photographic, do

not afford the opportunity for judging the degree to which the accessories simulate:

natural effects.

We frankly admit that in the matter of environmental groups of birds, Great
Britain still surpasses the United States. So far as taxidermy is concerned, Ameri-
can workmen can hold their own, but the art of making and grouping accessories
we have yet to acquire. The only successful accessory work done in this country is
that by the Mogridges, who were trained at South Kensington, and who are repre-
sented extensively in the New York Museum and by one piece in Washington.

Many of the groups of this kind, even when made by the Mogridges, err in mak-
ing the accessories more prominent than the birds and filling the cases with artifi-
cial flowers and leaves to such a degree that the birds are entirely subordinate. An
excellent illustration of effective and legitimate use of accessories is to be seen in
the admirable group of king-rails in the New York Museum.

is in preparing the other classes of Vertebrata and the Invertebrata that American
taxidermists take the lead, and it is their excellence in this direction that we have
endeavored to set forth as an example.

But for the general approval of the American work, as shown in the
comments upon this paper, I should perhaps not venture to express so
frankly my own opinion as to what the American taxidermists have
done, and, as it is, this is done chiefly for the purpose of explaining the
causes which have led to its development.

The editor of Natural Science is quite right in questioning Dr.
Shufeldt’s statement* that the development of taxidermy in the United
States is due to the stimulating influence of the World’s Columbian
Exposition. As a matter of fact, the taxidermy at the Columbian
Exposition, with the exception of thatin the Government building and
that of Prof. Dyche in the Kansas building, was decidedly poor. Cer-
tain mammal heads mounted by Mr. Stainsky were of high merit.
Beside these, there was scarcely a specimen of remarkable merit in the
general taxidermic display; and many of the groups, so-called, illus-
trating the fauna of special States, belonged to the grotesque and
unworkmanike period of twenty years ago.

Very important advances had been made before the Chicago Exposi-
tion was organized, and there was scarely a group among those shown
by the National Museum which had not been planned and partially
executed before preparation for the Exposition began. The Caribou
groups already referred to are possibly exceptions, but these were
simply advances along established lines.

To emphasize the fact that work of the very highest type was done
in the Museum as early as 1884, representations are given here of a
tiger (P]. 34) and a zebra (PI. 35) mounted by Mr. Hornaday and his
assistants at that time. These have all been engraved before, but so
unsatisfactorily that for the purpose of making a record in this place
new plates have been prepared.

The true explanation of our advance in taxidermy lies in the happy
relationship which was established in 1882 between the authorities of
the Museum and the representatives of the Society of Taxidermists.
These were based upon a recognition of the dignity of personal labor,
and a recognition of the fact that work of this kind could not be done
by men who counted their pay as the only remuneration for their
exertions. The taxidermist was recognized either as an artist or as an
expert artisan, as his individual capacities might merit, and he was
encouraged to do every part of the work with his own hands, trusting
nothing to laborers or ordinary mechanics. He was furthermore told
that one specimen well mounted would be more highly appreciated than
twenty “stuffed in the old way,” and that no expenditure of thought,

*Dr. Shufeldt assures me that his statement has been misapprehended, and that he
quite agrees with the critic in his views as to the cause of the development of the
higher taxidermy.—G. B. G.
48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

time, or material, was too great, if needful to secure the very best possi-
“ble results which his abilities would enable him to produce. When he
had accomplished a really creditable and conscientious piece of work,
his name was placed upon the label as its maker. In this way a good
piece of taxidermy is placed in the same standing, in its way, as a book
printed by Mr. William Morris or one bound by Mr. Cobden-Sanderson.

One of the former members of the Museum staff of taxidermists, now
engaged in other pursuits, writes:

The fact that the National Museum gives the author of a really good group credit
for it on the label has had a great influence for good. The American Musenm is the
only other that I have ever known to do this; but if the museum officers generally
could only know the tremendous stimulus this is to even the humblest taxidermist
all would take advantage of it. And it costs nothing. If your plan in this respect
were universally adopted it would be a constant and powerfu! stimulus to the pro-
duction of the finest kind of work. *

No taxidermist or modeler was placed in a responsible position who
was not himself a naturalist and whose own instincts did not lead him
to study a living model or the best attainable pictures or sculptures
of similar subjects before beginning his work, and whose painstaking
habits of research did not have’an influence upon his method of work
to such an extent that he would work out every muscle and bone with
reference to casts or skeletons before him in his workshop.

The workshops soon became filled with photographs and casts, and
among these would be seen models and sometimes originals from the
hand of Barye and other sculptors, whose art the taxidermist attempted
to adopt as far as possible into his own. These men were members of
the scientific societies, and some ot them have since become specialists
in science, although they have never lost their relationships to their
previous work. Prof. W. B. Scott, of Princeton University, and Prof.
F. H. Knowlton, of Columbian University, did excellent work in taxi-
dermy before leaving it for research-work, and Mr. L. L. Dyche, although
professor of zoology in the State University of Kansas, mounted with
his own hands most of the specimens in the great groups shown in the
Kansas State building at Chicago.

Incidentally it. may be mentioned that many American naturalists
are amateur taxidermists, and that some of the most successful groups
of mammals and birds in the Museum have been done by workmen
not possessed of artistic skill though excellent in technique, whose
work has been designed and directed by the curators of the several
departments. _

In connection with these discussions of American work it seems
desirable to refer to the extensive collection of South African mammals
and birds, exhibited at the Dr. Emil Holub’s South African Exposi-
tion in Prague in 1891.t+ The mammals were mounted in groups in

varied attitudes, and some of these groups were admirable. One of
them is here illustrated, as well as one group of birds (Pls. 36, 37).

Environmental g groups of marine animals.—It has long been a favorite
idea of the writer that the appearance and habits of fishes and other
aquatic animals might be best shown by mounting some of our colored
casts among natural surroundings in a case resembling an aquarium
tank, and admitting most of the light from above through glass so
tinted that the appearance of being under water would be given. All
attempts in this direction failed, however, and it has remained for Mr.
Lueas, in his group of Octopus (Pl. 38), to show that it is possible.
It is intended to carry this still further, and especially to attempt to
show the life of the coral reets.

Some groups of reptiles, colored casts in the midst of natural sur-
roundings, have also been completed, and these, though not realizing our
highest ideals, show that there are good possibilities in this direction.
The stuffing of skins of fishes has been carried to high perfection
in Europe, owing to the desire of anglers to preserve trophies of their
suecesstul excursions in their own homes. Simple accessories, such as
suffice to represent the shores of a stream or lake, are used with them
with a very good degree of effect. A wonderful display of these ang-
ling trophies was shown at the International Fisheries Exhibition in
London in 1883. It is our experience, however, that it is scarcely
advisable to stuff a sealy fish or reptile. Sharks may be stuffed, but
fishes are neither satisfactory nor lasting. If casts can not be had, it
is best to be content with preparations in spirits.

The mounting of the Pacific walrus.—In the discussion of the recent
taxidermic work in the Museum which has appeared from time to time
during the past year in the scientific journals, the Pacific walrus,
which was exhibited at the World’s Fair, has been severely criticised,
and it has been said that it is inartistic and false to nature.

The preservation of a worthy memorial to the North Pacific walrus
is especially desirable, since this is one of the species threatened with
extinction. Numbered by tens of thousands and flocking together in
immense droves when the American whaling fleet first entered the
Arctic in 1854, they have now been reduced to a mere handful in
American waters, and the old males are now entirely extinct in the
Western Pacific, and it is doubtful whether this particular phase of the
species is to be found anywhere. The specimen shown at the World’s
Fair (Pi. 39) is an admirable Example of the old male and since it was

complete, 13,000 objects being exhibited in addition to the groups of mammals
which were mounted in accordance with measurements made by Dr. Holub in Africa.
There were a number of groups of natives exhibited in connection with their actual
dwellings and the implements of their arts and industries. A large album of views
of this exposition and of the groups was presented to the Institution by Dr. Holub.

acquired only after long and continued effort it seems but proper that
its truth to nature, as now mounted, should be vindicated. bed

The skin in question was mounted by a most skillful and conscien-
tious member of the staff, the chief taxidermist, Mr. William Palmer,
who spent some months on the Pribilof Islands making preliminary
studies in order to fit himself for this particular undertaking.

Capt. E. P. Herendeen, formerly of the U. 8S. Coast Survey, who was
familiar with the Arctic Ocean for fifteen years, and who has seen tens
of thousands of walruses in the times when they were abundant, in
1854 and in subsequent years, and who has seen thousands of them
at one time upon the shore at Sandy Point, says of the specimen in the
Museum:

Iam satisfied that the mounted walrus is true to nature and in every respect an
admirable prece of work. The only criticism which I would make upon it is that
an animal in the attitude of extreme attention and activity in which this is repre-
sented would be slightly smaller about the neck. The arrangement of the wrinkles
in the skin and the tuberculated appearance of its surface are perfect, and the attitude
of the limbs can not be criticised.

The following statement of the material upon which the treatment of
the skin was founded is supplied by Mr. Palmer:

(1) Personal observations.—On August 7 we landed from the U.S. revenue-cutter
Rush on Walrus Island, having previously seen the remnant of a walrus herd, con-
sisting of eight individuals, on the island. We landed on the southern end of the
island and made our way over the rocky interior toward the walrus, but unfor-
tunately the vessel remained within sight of the animals, and the sailors from the
boat in which we had landed instead of keeping on the other side of the island:
persisted in getting into view of the walrus, with the result that before we got
within shooting distance they made preparations to leave the rocks. Before us was
a wide crevice in the rocks full of water, so that it was impossible to get over it,
and there not being time to get around the head of it before the walrus took to the
water, I sat down on the rocks at the edge of the crevice and examined the animals
at leisure. Before they had reached the water I had succeeded in fixing in my mind
the most important features of their physiognomy. The walrus nearest to me was
the one that I examined most thoroughly, and I convinced myself of the fact that
the general positions of the walrus, as delineated in Mr. Elliott’s pictures, was true,
and in mounting this specimen I followed as closely as possible the picture which
remained in my mind of this particular walrus. I had a fine view of the animal,
which was distant not more than 20 rods and within easy gunshot. No attempt
was made to kill the animal, however, since it was so near the water that if it had
been struck it would have fallen and been lost. Then, too, I hoped that there
might be another opportunity of capturing a specimen.

(2) Measurement from the fresh specimen.—The skin which was mounted was
obtained by the Rush ten days afterwards. This was after I left the island, how-
ever, and I was unable to study the animal in the flesh. Dr. White, the surgeon of
the cutter, however, made careful measurements in accordance with specifications
which I left in his hands, and I am satisfied that these measurements are accurate.
They met all the necessities of taxidermy, and are practically those which I would
have taken had Ibeen present. The only thing lacking which I could have supplied
would have been casts and photographs of certain portions. I had, however, the ad-
vantage of the head already in the Museum, which was received from Alaska in pickle
and practically in the flesh, and was mounted in that condition after careful study
by Mr. Hornaday. I also had a photograph of the great-bead of an Atlantic walrus.

(3) Pictures.—I had devoted some years to making a collection of tracings of all
the illustrations of the walrus in books of travel and natural history, and think I
had assembled some twenty of these, and am satisfied that I had, if not all, at least
all of the most important of those which made any claim to have been made by
observers. These were all quite unlike Mr. Elliott’s drawings, but, as I have said,
personal observation satistied me that these drawings were true to nature and the
others not. I showed Mr. Elliott’s pictures to many of the natives and others on the
islands, who all expressed themselves as perfectly satisfied with them.

(4) Anatomical indications.—In mounting the specimen the large wrinkled folds
on the skin around the limbs and body were followed as closely as possible, and
these, as every anatomist knows, indicate in no uncertain way the customary atti-
tudes of thick-skinned animals such as the walrus, the rhinoceros, the elephant, and
the armadillo. The shape and position of the warts on the neck, which look so gro-
tesque and unnatural in the Elliott pictures, were clearly shown in the skin and
could not possibly have been very different from those which Mr. Elliott delineated.
Even the inflamed surface as shown in the drawings, giving such a ghastly and dis-
agreeable appearance to the animal, were manifestly true to nature, which is also
supported by the testimony of people on the island and by Capt. Herendeen.

The deep wrinkles at the base of the flipper. have been criticised as unnatural,
but my own observations on many specimens of fur seal, sea lions, and walruses,
and which are confirmed by many competent observers whom I have consulted (in
fact, they can be readily found on any pickled skin), satisfied me that I was correct.

The thinness and smoothness of the skin in the center of these wrinkles, their
position and general direction, even as illustrated in the palm of one’s own hand, will
convince anyone who sees them that there must necessarily be wrinkles at those
points when by the position of the animal the skin and blubber is entirely released
of all tension and even crowded on itself; indeed, the most conspicuous feature of the
surface of an animal of this division of the pinnipeds as he moves about, is the rapid
change in the position and form of these wrinkles on many parts of the body.

The accompanying illustration (Pl. 40) shows the manner in which the folds
appeared in the fresh skin, the process of making them permanent, and the manner
of preserving them as the mounting progresses.

Criticisms have been made also upon the shape of the nostrils. In regard to this
I can only say that my guide was the appearance of the nostrils in the skin before it
was fleshed, and when it was comparatively fresh. This I considered myself justi-
fied in doing, since I am not aware that anybody has made careful observations upon
the appearance of the nostrils close at hand, except Mr. Elliott, whose drawings cor-
respond with my interpretation, and Capt. Herendeen says that the walrus never
opens its nostrils wide, and that it is only when breathing or excited that they are
open to any considerable degree.

It has heen also said that the neck is possibly a little too large, but the dimensions
of the specimen as mounted are smaller in this part than is indicated by the measure-
ments made by Dr. White. In mounting it I took into consideration the probability
that the animal in life, standing with head erect and muscles rigid, would measure
somewhat less.

It should be clearly stated that the preparation under discussion was intended to
show the appearance in life of the animal to which this skin belonged, namely, an
old male such as are rarely seen, and that none but old males assume the grotesque
attitudes of which this is one. A young male would never present the same appear-
ance even in the same attitude, because they are comparatively smooth, with thin-
ner skins, more hair, and fewer tubereular growths upon the surface.

It should be said also that this represents the animal upon land and in action,
just as it would appear after being aroused from sleep and just before making its
way to the water. The customary attitude in which walruses are mounted, with
52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893. Se

the flippers stretched out behind as in the hair seals, is not itself untrue to nature,
buf is only assumed by them when in repose or asleep, while with the hair seal it is
constant.

It has been questioned whether it would be wise to mount a young Pacific walrus
in the same attitude as that of the old male under discussion, but Capt. Herendeen
states, from his experience, that all walruses, young and old, assume these positions
when in action.

REPRESENTATIONS OF THE HUMAN FIGURE.

For fifteen years the Museum has been constructing models of the
human figure for use in the exhibition series, and has been striving by
various means to secure the best results in this direction.

These figures are required for three purposes: (1) To show the char-
acteristics of the different races, (2) to display costumes, and (3) to
illustrate the methods of use of weapons, instruments, and processes
of various arts and handicrafts.

For the first purpose it is manifest that the greatest accuracy and
fidelity to nature is necessary, or the result will be useless. For the
others the same degree of accuracy is, perhaps, not essential, if the labels
clearly indicate that the faces are not portraits, but so far as possible the
figures intended chiefly to show costume and action should attain the
highest possible anatomicai perfection.

The use of well-constructed figures in scientific museums is of quite
recent origin, though manikins of conventional type have long been
employed in collections of costumes and armor; and many very credit-
able efforts in this direction have been made in connection with expo.
sitions.

Before beginning our experiments we were familiar with the altogether
admirable gallery of historical figures in Castan’s “ Panopticum” in
Berlin, and with those of Madam Tussaud in London, not so very
good in execution, but nevertheless of high interest to the masses. We
knew the representation of races of mankind at Sydenham and the
Swedish peasant figures which had been so popular at the Philadelphia
Centennial. We have since become familiar with the separate groups
showing the history of primitive man, made for the Paris Exposition in
1888~’89, and the figures of race types in the Trocadero Museum in
Paris. Indeed, we owe.to the courtesy of Dr. Hamy the privilege of
having had made copies of several of the-latter, one of which is here
illustrated (P]. 41), and at the same time obtaining a replica of the
Roman warrior in armor, modeled for the Museum of Artillery in
Paris, by the sculptor Bartholdi.

It is searcely worth while to mention the ghastly wax figures of
Kane, the arctie explorer, and his companions, in costumes of fur,
which were displayed in the old Smithsonian Museum as early as 1870.
These, and the equally crude manikins of Eskimo Joe and his wife
Hannah, made in 1873, have long since been discarded and have no
place in the history of recent eftorts.

The first advances were made in 1875, when four costiimed figures
were imported from Japan. These were exceedingly spirited and eftee-
tive, and when examined in detail showed such conscientious workman-
ship and such thorough fidelity to nature that they have served as an
inspiration and a model for our workmen up to this day. Two of these
figures, representing an actor and an actress in the costume of Japan-
ese nobility, were carved in wood, and seem to show the extreme limits
of this material in the construction of the human model. The other
two, a laborer and his wife (Pl. 42), are in papier-maché and are satis-
factory in the highest degree. The material is brought to an extreme
of hardness, strength, and delicacy of line which no American work-
man has been able to rival. Indeed, we have not yet progressed
beyond the use of the much heavier and clumsier plaster of Paris.
The modeling is almost perfect, as may be judged from the fact that
the figures, with or without clothing, stand poised upon their feet
without any attachment to the bottom of the case. The hair is
attached directly to the figures and has none of the wig-like appear-
ance which is almost universal in figures of this kind. The eyes,
though glass is used for the outer film, are not glass eyes. Even the
nails are cunningly fashioned of horn and inserted; and the coloring,
of which more will be said hereafter, is as yet the despair of our work-
men. The figures as a whole exhibit such conscientious and painstak-
ing accuracy, and such fidelity to nature in the smallest details, that
too much can not be said in their praise. (See Pl. 43.)

In 1881 some figures were made for us by M. Achille Colin, a French
sculptor living in Washington, on a new plan. These were executed
in accordance with the rules of sculpture, the hair and the clothing
to be of the same material as the head and body, and the seulptor’s
eye to be used instead of the customary one of glass. They were
then painted by a portrait painter whose life had been spent in delin-
eating Indians. The result was thoroughly satisfactory, and nothing
better has since been done. (Pls. 44 and 45.) It is probable that
this method will be used more and more in the future, since many of
the races whose lineaments and costumes it is most desirable to per-
petuate can only be shown in this way. Their costumes no longer
exist, and must be supplied by the modeler and painter from such por-
traits as those of which we have a large number in the Catlin gallery.
When actual garments are not used, there is no reason for the unsightly
wig or the staring glass eye.

A modification of the same method was employed by Mr. U. S. J.
Dunbar, a Washington sculptor, in modeling the face of a Sioux girl,
Rosa White Thunder, for a full-length figure to be clad in a modern
Sioux costume of blue cloth ornamented with elk ivory, obtained from
the original, at that time a pupil in the. Indian school at Carlisle. In
this figure, although the sculptured eye is used, the hair is represented
by a wig. The result is only partly satisfactory, but the experiment is
an interesting one. (PI. 46.)
54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

More recently other methods have been employed. Mr. J. W. Hend-
ley, a man of great ingenuity and mechanical skill employed in mak-
ing models of fruit, produced a cast from life of a negro boy, which in
its way is something entirely unique. Although no portion of the fig-
ure was touched by the modeler or sculptor, it has the merit of abso-
lute accuracy, and yet is surprisingly spirited and life-like—a Samoan
youth (Pl. 47), modeled from photographs under the direction of
Lieut. W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy, who is very familiar with these peo-
ple; a Dyak warrior (Pl. 48), produced in the same way under the
supervision of Mr. Hornaday, and an Indian in feather costume (PI.
49), from a painting by an Indian artist of Chile, are thoroughly sat-
isfactory, as is also a Bantu negro boy, modeled by Mr. Theodore
Mills from life, by the aid of casts. (PI. 50.)

A number of figures of the same general character were prepared
for the World’s Fair. None of these were so carefully made as those
already described, owing to the confusion and haste which always
attend the preparation for a great exhibition. A new feature of
the greatest interest was, however, introduced among the figures pre-
pared for this occasion, and a set of groups, unique and full of interest,
was the result. These, as shown in the cases, surrounded by proper
environmental accessories and engaged in the occupations peculiar to
the tribes which they represented, were no longer pieces of sculpture
but pictures from life. The success of these groups is due to the
supervision exercised by Prof. W. H. Holmes, artist as well as ethnol-
ogist, who gave life and pictorial expression to the figures already
accurately modeled and costumed by the Museum preparators, who
himself designed a spirited group of Powhatan Indians quarrying
material for the manufacture of stone implements, which was modeled
by Mr. U.S. J. Dunbar. To Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing, whose long
residence among the Indians of the southwest has given him perfect
familiarity with their customs, and in whom mechanical skill supple-
ments an artistic temperament, is due the perfection of other groups
showing the life of these people. These are:

1. The Zuni ritual of creation.

2, The Zuni bread-makers and millers. (PI. 51.)

3. The Zuni potter.

4. The Zuni basket-maker.

>». The Zuni belt-maker.

6. Navajo women, spinning and weaving.

7. Indian women of the plains dressing hides. (PI. 52.)

The first group of the new style made was the group of Kiowa chil-
dren at play, equally good in its way, designed some years ago by
Mr. James Mooney, of the Bureau of Ethnology, who also planned the
group of Navajo silversmiths. Dr. W. J. Hoffman’s ‘The Primitive
Scribe,” a Chippewa shaman in his lodge writing an incantation on
prepared birchbark, and another of a Crow Indian painting a blanket,
are worthy of notice.

The groups of Loucheux and Hupa Indians, arranged by Prof.
Holnes, were also effective artistically, though lacking the advantages
which a personal acquaintance with the tribe would have given the
designs.

The relative values of costumes and implements displayed upon
manikins, and those shelved in cases with tickets explaining their uses,
need no discussion. A caution should be written to museum men, how-
ever, which is that itis very dangerous to try to make such groups except
under the eye of an ethnologist who has been among the people to be
represented. The object of a reference to these groups is simply to
call attention to the fact that something has been done which was
never before attempted for the American Indian, and that the result
seems to more than justify the effort,

Experiments are still in progress, and it is believed that figures still
more truthful and life-like than any that have yet been produced will
be the result. The most serious difficulty to be overcome is in the
treatment of the surface of the figures and their coloring. We use
only plaster of Paris. Wax, which has beenso often employed for faces
and hands, has been discarded as being too delicate, and not so well suited
for hfe-like effects as plaster. Papier-maché, as has been stated, our
workmen can not manipulate so as to produce sufficient hardness of
surface and delicacy of line. The gelatine which has been used for
natural history preparations offers no absolute permanence. Plaster of
Paris has only one objection, which is the roughness of its surface. It
is now believed that the smoothness and texture of the flesh can be
produced by the use of some of the mineral waxes.

The question of coloring is a more difficult one. Our Japanese figures,
on close examination, do not present a uniform hue, but have a solid
body color, enlivened by innumerable dots of a much darker tone.
These are produced by some spatter-work process, either by spraying
from a stiff brush, or by blowing the pigment in a fine spray from the
mouth. When viewed at a short distance, the effect is precisely that
of living flesh. Experiments are now being made with the air brush,
which will doubtless produce the same effect.

The representation of human hair, especially of the beard, also pre-
sents great difficulties; but it is believed that in time tbe use of plas-
ter and paint will supplant the products of the wig factory.

It will be observed that the steps of progress in modeling man have
been very similar to those in the mounting of the lower animals, and
the influence of the skilful American taxidermist has been felt every-
where in this work also.

Allusion has already been made to the taxidermy at the Holub exhi-
bition in Prague. The mounting of anthropological groups was even
more ambitious and successful, and is illustrated here by three plates,
showing a group in action, a group in repose, and a single figure to
show details of modeling. [ Plates, 53, 54, 55.) In the anthropological
as well as the zoological groups, the generous space of the exposition
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

afforded opportunities which are not often available in museums.
Indeed the permanence of museum work seems to demand not only
greater compactness, but more reserve, repose, and dignity than is
necessary in installation for a temporary exhibition.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS.

It is not expected that in the ethnographical museum of the future
the lay figure will supplant the show case as a means for displaying
ethnographic collections; but just as naturalists may feel it legitimate
to use a considerable number of cases of animals mounted in the midst
of natural surroundings to illustrate their habits or to make impressive
memorials of species which are rarely seen or likely to become extinct,
so will the anthropologist employ figures, not only for the education of
the public, but as a more sure means of preserving certain of the most
precious memorials of the primitive races of mankind.

It will soon be time to consider the question to what extent museums
arejustified in the use of environmental groups. It is evident that this
may be carried too far and be made tiresome instead of agreeable to
visitors, while at the same time producing an effect quite opposite to
that of dignified and systematic order, which should be characteristie
of every museum. Furthermore, specimens thus mounted, unless the
workmanship is of the very best and the cases practically perfect and
impervious to air, are certain to deteriorate, since it is very difficult to
get at them in order to cleanse them and protect them from vermin.
The writer has seen neglected cases of this kind in some of the largest
government museums of. the Old World, which were serious warnings
against departure from the practice of individual mounts in cases free
from the incumbrance of accessories.

In the National Museum a definite limit has been fixed. Environ-
mental groups will only be made in the case of the larger mammals and
birds which are rarely seen and are on the verge of extinction, or for
the purpose of illustrating some very remarkable habit.

It has been found in the installation of our department of birds
that the series of Audubon’s plates, showing the habits of birds, framed
and hung near the exhibition cases, are almost as effective as the
groups mounted to illustrate the same phases in their habits.

CONCERNING COLLECTIONS AND SPECIMENS.

The following principles in regard to collections and specimens rep-
resent in a general way the ideas which underlhe all our recent work:

Collections in general.—Any object which has a name may be used in
museum work. It does not follow, however, that any one museum
should attempt to include all such objects, nor that there are not many
which, in the present stage of museum practice. might net be entirely
neglected.

Specimens i a museum are like the types in a printing office. They
may be sorted in the cases in conventional order so as to be accessible
when needed, or they may be used to make intelligible almost any train
of thought or series of ideas, each being available in hundreds of dif-
ferent relationships.

Single or unrelated specimens, though valuable or interesting, are in
themselves of little moment in comparison with series of much less
precious objects which unite to teach some lesson to student or visitor.

Cumbersome and superfluous materials in collections. —One of the great-
est perils to a museum is the possession of vast collections.

Cojlections which are encumbered with conditions as to manner of
disposition and installation are usually causes of serious embarrass-
ment.

Not the least important duty of the curator is to prevent the acces-
sion of undesirable material.

Material not germane to the plan of a museum should be exchanged
or given to other museums which have use for it. What is expensive
and unprofitable to one may be of the greatest use to another.

Advances in any museum are effected not only by accession and
enlargement, but by the constant substitution of better specimens, by
advance in methods of display, labeling, and handbooks.

The principal uses of specimens.—A museum is rarely justified in
exhibiting all its materials. An exhibition series, when properly
installed, is more effective when limited than when extensive.

Specimens not needed in the exhibition series are much more useful
when placed in a reserve or study series, either to be used by students;
to be exchanged or given to other museums, or to be employed when
occasion may offer in forming new exhibition series.

The exhibition series.—The effectiveness of amuseum for popular eul
ture depends chietly upon:

(1) A careful selection and effective arrangement of the specimens
exhibited (which implies the exclusion of many objects in themselves
attractive and interesting).

(2) A thorough system of labels in simple language, supplemented
by pictures, diagrams, maps, and books of reference.

(3) Specimens for exhibition should be selected solely with reference
to the lesson they can teach, singly or in combination.

(4) To complete a series, any specimen is better than none.

(5) A copy, model, or picture of a good thing is often more useful
than an actual specimen of a poor one.

(6) A picture or model may often be shown to advantage in place of
a minute or unintelligible object.

(7) Books, manuscripts, pictures, maps, ete., become specimens when
treated in the museum method.

The study series:

(1) Specimens in the study series should be acquired in series sutfti-
58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1893.

ciently large to meet the needs of students who are known to exist.
While nothing of value should be lost, it is questionable whether mate-
rial should be sought in large quantity, when there is no indication that
it will soon be needed.

(2) Study specimens should be stored as compactly and economically
as is consistent with their safety and convenient use, and should be
accessible to every student.

(5) The study series is the storehouse from which the exhibition
series may be replaced or extended and from which the needs of other
museums may be supplied.

Records.—The most important fact concerning any object is the local-
ity where it was found; next most important, the person from whom it
was received. Every specimen should have its catalogue number
indelibly engraved or marked upon it, and, when possible, the locality
and source. Specimens can be named at any time, but the locality
once lost, the object becomes comparatively valueless. The record of
donors should be accurate and complete, so that the specimens from
any given source can be traced at once to their location.
