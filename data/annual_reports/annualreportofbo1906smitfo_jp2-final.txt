PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS FOR THE YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1906.

At a meeting held March 12, 1903, the Board of Regents adopted
the following resolution:

Resolved, That, in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the fourth
Wednesday in January, regular meetings of the Board shall be held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in December and on the 6th day of March,
unless that date falls on Sunday, when the fellowing Monday shall be sub-
stituted.

In accordance with this resolution, the Board met at 10 o’clock
a.m. on December 5, 1905, and on January 24+ and March 6, 1906. A
special meeting was also held on May 16, 1906.

REGULAR MEETING OF DECEMBER 5, 1905.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller (Chancellor) in the chair; Rep-
resentative R. R. Hitt, Representative Robert Adams, jr., Represent-
ative Hugh A. Dinsmore, Dr. Andrew D. White, the Hon. John B.
Henderson, the Hon. George Gray, and the Acting Secretary, Mr.
Richard Rathbun.

The Acting Secretary announced that the Secretary was unable to
be present on account of illness.

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING.

The minutes of the meeting held March 6, 1905, were read in
abstract and approved.

DEATH OF SENATOR O. H. PLATT.

The Chancellor said: “ It becomes my sad duty to bring to the
attention of the Board a matter which is undoubtedly in the minds of
us all—the departure of our friend and late colleague, Orville H.
Platt. He died in the midst of his labors, cut like a diamond with its
own dust. In view of his long and eminent career, and of the many
years of faithful, intelligent, and useful service rendered this Insti-
tution, I suggest that we put upon our records a minute expressive of
our sense of loss.”

Judge Gray then offered the following resolutions, which were
unanimously adopted: |

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution is called upon
to mourn the death, on April 21, 1905, of Orville Hitchcock Platt, a member of
the Board since 1899;

Be it resolved, That the Regents give expression to their sense of loss in the

xI
XII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

demise of a man of exemplary rectitude, who discharged all his duties with
wisdom, fidelity and conscientious care; a statesman of the first rank whose
services to his country are of enduring worth. This Board has lost a colleague
whose interest in the affairs of the Institution was ever keen, and whose sery-
ices were always helpful. At the meetings of the Board, on committees to
which he was appointed, and in the Senate Chamber, his voice was always given
with that combination of progressive thought and conservative judgment which
so distinguished his character. In his death the nation has lost a wise states-
man, the Institution a valued counsellor, and the members of the Board a
cherished friend.

Resolved, That this resolution be entered as a part of the journal of the
Board, and a copy thereof be transmitted to Mrs. Platt.

THE FREER ART COLLECTIONS.

The Chancellor brought before the Board the offer of Mr. Charles
L. Freer, of Detroit, Michigan, to bequeath or make present convey-
anee of title to his art collections to the Smithsonian Institution or
the United States Government, as indicated in his letter to the Secre-
tary of December 27, 1904. The Acting Secretary read a letter from
Mr. Freer, acknowledging the resolution adopted by the Board at its
meeting on March 6, 1905.

After an extended discussion it was, on motion of Judge Gray:

Resolved, That in view of the difficulties concerning any action by the Regents
in reference to the offer made by Mr. Freer, and of our high appreciation of the
generosity exhibited by him, the Secretary be instructed to write Mr. Freer

asking his permission to make public the correspondence between him and the
Regents regarding his said offer.

The following resolution was also agreed to:

Whereas the special committee appointed to visit Detroit and examine the art
collection of Mr. Freer reported that ‘it was mutually agreed that, at some
early period during the next session of Congress and at the convenience of the
Board of Regents of this Institution, Mr. Freer would visit Washington and
exhibit such portions of his collection as might properly and fairly represent
the whole; ”

Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to provide a suitable place in the
building of the Smithsonian Institution or the United States National Museum
for the exhibit of such collections as Mr. Freer may desire to bring to Wash-
ington, and that he communicate with Mr. Freer to ascertain what time would
be most convenient for the exhibit of a representative selection as agreed upon
between Mr. Freer and the committee of the Board of Regents.

DEFALCATIONS OF W. W. KARR.

The Acting Secretary submitted to the Board, on behalf of the
Secretary, a statement of the defalcations of W. W. Karr, for many
years the accountant and disbursing agent of the Institution, involv-
ing a serious loss to its income. After remarks by Senator Hender-
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

son, chairman of the executive committee, and others, the following
resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the matter of the Karr defalcations be referred to the execu-
live committee with a request that they will consider it fully and make report
at the next meeting of the Board.

NEW BUILDING FOR THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Acting Secretary reported progress in the construction of
the new building for the National Museum. The first stone was laid
on August 21, 1905, and the walls and piers of the basement were
approaching completion. The steel girders for the main floor were
at hand, and it was expected that the walls of another story would be
finished before the end of the fiscal year.

ANNUAL MEETING OF JANUARY 24, 1906.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller (Chancellor) in the chair; Sen-
ator Henry Cabot Lodge, Senator A. O. Bacon, Representative Rob-
ert Adams, jr., Representative W. M. Howard, Dr. J. B. Angell, the
Ton. Richard Olney, the Hon. George Gray, Dr. A. Graham Bell,

and the Acting Secretary, Mr. Richard Rathbun.
APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS.

The Chancellor announced the appointment of Regents, as fol-
lows:

By the Vice President, on the part of the Senate, December 7, 1905:
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge in place of Senator Orville H. Platt,
deceased; and Senator A. O. Bacon to succeed Senator Francis M.
Cockrell, whose term of service in the Senate had expired.

By the Speaker, on the part of the House of Representatives,
December 13, 1905: Representatives R. R. Hitt and Robert Adams,
jr., to succeed themselves, and Representative W. M. Howard to
succeed Mr. Hugh A. Dinsmore, whose term as Representative had
expired.

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING.

The minutes of the meeting held December 5, 1905, were read in
abstract and approved.

THE SECRETARY *S ABSENCE.

The Chancellor read a letter from the Secretary explaining that ill-
ness would prevent his attendance at the meeting, and asking the
indulgence of the Board for his absence from his post. The Secre-
XIV PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

tary stated that his last annual report to the Board had been com-
pleted prior to his illness and would be laid before the meeting, and
that he was confident that the affairs of the Institution were well in
hand and its work would go forward.

RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO INCOME AND EXPENDITURE.

On behalf of the executive committee Doctor Bell offered the fol-
lowing resolution, which was adopted :

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1907, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by
the Secretary, with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion
on the part of the Secretary as to items.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Acting Secretary submitted the annual report of the Secretary
to June 30, 1905, which was accepted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

Doctor Bell submitted the annual report of the executive commit-
tee to June 30, 1905, which, on motion, was accepted, with the under-
standing that it might be brought up at the next meeting for
adoption.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE.

The permanent committee reported, through Doctor Bell, as fol-
lows:

Hodgkins fund.—The case of Smith v. O'Donoghue has been set
tor hearing on the 13th of February next. This case, in which the
Institution is interested as residuary legatee under the will of Mr.
Hodgkins, involves the hability of the residual estate on a warranty
deed of certain property in New York City conveyed by Mr. Hodg-
kins in May, 1871. It was decided in favor of the Institution in the
appellate division, and the chances are considered excellent for suc-
cess in the court of appeals.

Andrews will case.—The hearing upon the application of the exec-
utor to have the Andrews will interpreted was had in the New York
supreme court, and a decision has been handed down establishing the
right of the Andrews Institute for Girls to receive the legacy pro-
vided in the will, thus depriving the Smithsonian of the residual
legacy of perhaps one and a half million dollars. Counsel of the
Institution are of the opinion that though the decision in the lower
court is unfavorable to the Institution the prospects of success in the
appellate division are good. It is the intention to join with the
heirs in appealing the case.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

Avery bequest—Offers have been received during the year from
private parties for the purchase of several of the Avery properties,
but as they were deemed inadequate, the proposals were not consid-
ered. An appraisement of these properties shows an estimated total
valuation of $35,500.

Sprague and Reid bequests ——There have been no changes in the
status of the Sprague and Reid bequests during the year.

On motion the report was accepted.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON THE DEFALCATIONS OF
WwW. W. KARR.

Doctor Bell, on behalf of the executive committee, presented a
report based upon their examination into the defalcations of W. W.
Karr, in comphance with the resolution of the Board of December 5,
1905. The methods employed by the former accountant in abstract-
ing funds and the amounts embezzled were fully set forth. The pecu-
lations consisted mainly in appropriating miscellaneous receipts
derived from the sale of publications, repayments of moneys, ete.,
though approximately $4,000 had been taken from funds received for
the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature and $7,400 from
Government appropriations for the National Museum. The latter
sum, however, was immediately repaid by the company by which
Karr was bonded. The capital of the Institution, in view of the
manner of its investment, could not be touched.

Immediately upon the discovery of the defalcation Karr was appre-
hended. Later he was indicted, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to
five years’ imprisonment in the penitentiary.

The report concluded with a statement of the safeguards which had
been adopted to prevent the further misappropriation of funds, and
with a draft of the following resolution :

Resolved, That the executive committee be authorized to employ an expert

sccountant to act as clerk of the committee in connection with its examination
of accounts.

The resolution was agreed to and the report accepted.

Doctor Bell expressed the opinion that the Institution was respon-
sible for the amount abstracted by the accountant from the funds of
the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, which amount
should have been forwarded to the London office by the Institution,
in accordance with its agreement to act as the American representa-
tive for the collection and transmission of subscriptions. This view
was accepted by the Board, and on motion of Judge Gray the follow-
ing resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the executive committee be instructed to make application to
Congress, as they may see fit, for an appropriation to cover the amount col-

lected by the Institution for the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature
and embezzled by its former accountant.
XVI PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

THE FREER ART COLLECTIONS.

The Chancellor laid before the Board a letter from the President,
urging the acceptance of the Freer collections, and inclosing a com-
munication from Mr. Freer, dated December 15, 1905, reciting the
terms and conditions of his offer as then made through him.

These letters are as follows:

THe WHITE Howse,
Washington, December 19, 1905.
To the Chief Justice of the United States, Chancellor of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. and Member of the Board of Regents:

Sm: I herewith inclose a copy of a letter sent to me by Mr. Charles L. Freer
offering to bequeath his art collections to the Smithsonian Institution or the
United States Government. together with $500,000 in money to construct a suit-
able building; or if it is deemed preferable, to make a present conveyance of
the title to such Institution or the Government and a bequest of the sum of
$500,000 for the building. The offer is made upon certain terms and conditions
which, in my judgment, are proper and reasonable.

It is impossible to speak in too high terms of the munificence shown by Mr.
Freer in this offer: and it is one which the Government of the United States
should at once close with as a matter of course. Mr. Freer’s collection is liter-
ally priceless; it includes hundreds of the most remarkable pictures by the
best known old masters of China and Japan. It also includes hundreds of pic
tures, studies, and etchings by certain notable American artists, those by
Whistler alone being such as would make the whole collection of unique value—
although the pictures by the Chinese and Japanese artists are of even greater
worth and consequence. There are other art pieces which I need not mention.
Any comptent critic can testify to the extraordinary value of the collection. I
should suggest that either Doctor Sturgis Bigelow or Mr. John La Farge be
sent to Detroit to examine the collection, if there is any question about it;
although I assume that every member of the Board of Regents is familiar with
its worth. The conditions which Mr. Freer imposes are in effect that nothing
shall be added to or taken from the collection after his death, and that the col-
lection shall be exhibited by itself in the building to be constructed for it with-
out charge to the public; furthermore, that he shall have the right to make
such additions to the collection as he may deem advisable, but not to take any-
thing away from it after April next. the collections remaining in the possession
of Mr. Freer until his death and then in the possession of his executors until the
completion of the building. These conditions are, of course, eminently proper.

All that is asked of the Government or the Regents of the Smithsonian now is
that they shall accept this magnificently generous offer. Nothing whatever else
is demanded at present. When Mr. Freer’s death occurs land will, of course,
have to be allotted for the erection of the building—a building which will itself
be a gift of great beauty to the Government—and when the building is com-
pleted and the collection installed therein, and not before, Congress will have
to take some steps to provide the comparatively small sum necessary to take
care of what will be a national asset of great value.

I need hardly say that there are any number of communities and of institu-
tions which would be only too glad themselves to promise to erect such a build-
ing as that which Mr. Freer is going to erect, for the sake of getting this col-
lection. The offer is one of the most generous that ever has been made to this
Government, and the gift is literally beyond price. All that is now asked is
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. eV LT

that we shall agree to accept on behalf of the nation the great benefit thus to be
bestowed upon the nation.

I hope that the Regents of the Smithsonian will feel warranted to close with
the offer; for they are the national guardians of such a collection. If in their
wisdom they do not see their way to accept the gift, I shall then be obliged to
take some other method of endeavoring to prevent the loss to the United States
Government, and therefore to the people of the United States, of one of the most
valuable collections which any private individual has ever given to any people.

Sincerely yours,
(Signed ) THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 15, 1905.
To the PRESIDENT:

Permit me to repeat my offer to bequeath my art collections to the Smith-
sonian Institution or to the United States Government, and also the sum of five
hundred thousand dollars in money for the purpose of constructing a suitable
building in which to house them, upon the following terms and conditions:

First. The sum of five hundred thousand dollars shall be paid by my executors
to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution or the United States Government
promptly after my decease, and shall be used forthwith for the construction of a
fireproof building connected with the National Museum, the construction of
which has been recently authorized, or reasonably near thereto.

Second. The interior of this building shall be arranged with special regard for
the convenience of students and others desirous of an opportunity for uninter-
rupted study. A suitable space shall be provided in which the Peacock Room
shall be reerected complete. The whole interior arrangement of the building
shall be agreed upon between the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution and
myself within a reasonable time after the acceptance of this offer.

Third. The collections, with such additions thereto as shall be made during
my lifetime, shall be delivered by my executors to the Regents immediately after
the building is constructed and ready to receive them.

Fourth. The collections and the building shall be cared for and maintained
perpetually by the Smithsonian Institution or the United States Government at
its own expense.

Fifth. No addition or deduction shall be made to the collections after my
death, and nothing else shall ever be exhibited with them, or in the same build-
ing, nor shall the said collections, or any part thereof, be removed at any time
from the said building except when necessary for the purpose of making repairs
or renovations in the building.

Sixth. No charge shall ever be made for admission to the building or for the
privilege of examining or studying the collections.

Seventh. The collections and building shall always bear my name in some
modest and appropriate form.

In lieu of the foregoing offer, I am willing, upon the conditions above
expressed, to make a present conveyance of the title to said collections to the
Institution or the Government, and a bequest of the sum of five hundred thou-
sand dollars for the building, provided :

1. The collections shall remain in my possession during my life, and in the
possession of my executors after my death until the completion of the building.

2. I shall have the right to make such additions to the collections as may seem
to me advisable or necessary for the improvement of the collections, or any of
them.

sM 1906——1iI
XVIII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

3. On or before April next, I will file with the officials of the Smithsonian
Institution or the United States Government a descriptive inventory of the
objects belonging to the collections.

4. Both I and my executors shall be free from any liability on account of
any loss in, or danger that may accrue to the collections while in my or their
charge, even though such loss or injury shall occur by reason of my or their
negligence, or the negligence of my or their servants, agents or employees.

The exact form of the bequest or gift, and the details for carrying it into
execution, are legal questions that can be agreed upon by counsel representing
the Institution or the Government and myself.

I am, with great respect, very sincerely yours.
2 CHARLES L, FREER.

This offer differed from that made directly to the Secretary of the
Institution under date of December 27, 1904, in omitting the word
“changes” in section 3 of the proposition to bequeath, leaving to
Mr. Freer only the right to add to the collections, section 2 of the
offer to make present conveyance being also modified to the same
effect. Under the offer of present conveyance an additional clause,
numbered 3, had been added, as follows: “ On or before April next I
will file with the officials of the Smithsonian Institution or the United
States Government a descriptive inventory of the objects belonging
to the collections.”

After a discussion of the significance of these changes and of reso-
lutions offered by Doctor Bell looking toward the acceptance of the
offer, the following resolution was adopted :

The Board of Regents, recognizing the great value to the people of the United
States of the art collection so generously offered by Mr. Charles L. Freer, of
Detroit, Michigan,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution do hereby
accept the tender of Mr. Freer to make present conveyance to the Institution of
the title to his art collection, and to bequeath to the Institution the sum of five
hundred thousand dollars for the construction of a fireproof building in which

to house it—under the terms as stated in his communication to the President of
the United States dated December 15, 1905.

REQUEST OF BELL & CO. FOR REIMBURSEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE
BARNETT FORGERIES.

Doctor Bell read a letter from Messrs. Bell & Co., bankers, request-
ing that the Institution submit an estimate to Congress for the sum
of $525, with interest, to reimburse the bank in that amount, which
had been paid on forged indorsements of Frank M. Barnett while
an employee of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Doctor Bell
said that the letter had been considered by the executive committee
which had resolved to submit it to the Board of Regents with a recom-
mendation that it be referred to the attorney of the Institution for
examination and report. On motion, the letter was so referred.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIX
REGULAR MEETING OF MARCH 6, 1906.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller (Chancellor) in the chair; the
Vice-President, Hon. Charles W. Fairbanks; Senator Henry Cabot
Lodge; Senator A. O. Bacon; Representative Robert Adams, jr.;
Representative W. M. Howard; Dr. Andrew D. White; Dr. A. Gra-
ham Bell, and the Acting Secretary, Mr. Richard Rathbun.

DEATH OF SECRETARY LANGLEY.

The Chancellor announced the death of Secretary Langley, at
Aiken, South Carolina, on February 27, 1906, and designated the
Vice-President and Senator Lodge as a committee to draft a suitable
minute to be spread upon the records and to be transmitted to the
family of Mr. Langley. The following resolution was subsequently
adopted by a rising vote:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution express
their profound sorrow at the death on February 27, 1906, of Samuel Pierpont
Langley, Secretary of the Institution since 1887, and tender to the relatives of
Mr. Langley their sincere sympathy in their bereavement ;

That in the death of Mr. Langley this Institution has lost a distinguished,
efficient and faithful executive officer, under whose administration the interna-
tional influence of the parent Institution has been greatly increased, and by
whose personal efforts two important branches of work have been added to its
care—the National Zoological Park and the Astrophysical Observatory ;

That the scientific world is indebted to Mr. Langley for the invention of
important apparatus and instruments of precision, for numerous additions to
knowledge, more especially for his epoch-making inventions in solar physics, and
for his efforts in placing the important subject of aerial navigation upon a sci-
entific basis ;

That all who sought the truth and cultivated science, letters, and the fine arts,
have lost through his death a coworker and a sympathizer ;

That the executive committee be requested to arrange for a memorial meeting
to be held in Washington ;

That Dr. Andrew D. White be invited to prepare a suitable memorial which
shall form a part of the records of this Board ;

That the expenses of the funeral of Mr. Langley be provided for out of the
income of the Institution.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENT.

The Chancellor announced the reappoitment of Mr. Richard
Olney asa Regent by joint resolution of Congress approved February

xX PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

The report of the executive committee for the year ending June 30,
1905, presented and accepted at the annual meeting, was adopted.

REQUEST OF BELL & CO. FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

Doctor Bell, on behalf of the executive committee, reported that in
accordance with the action of the Board at its last meeting the request
of Bell & Co. had been submitted to the attorney for the Institution,
who had expressed the opinion that the Institution was neither
morally nor legally obligated. The matter was referred back to the
committee for further inquiry and consideration, and Senator Bacon
was designated to act with the committee.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

Doctor Bell, on behalf of the executive committee, referring to the
resolution adopted at the last meeting, authorizing the committee to
apply to Congress for an appropriation to cover the amount collected
for the International Catalogue by the Institution, and embezzled by
the late accountant, reported that it was deemed inadvisable to make
such application, but recommended that Congress be asked to appro-
priate funds for the continuance of the catalogue on behalf of the
Government. He offered the following resolutions, which were sepa-
rately adopted:

Resolved, That there be paid to the Central Bureau of the International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature at London, from time to time as the funds
permit, the sum embezzled by W. W. Karr from the subscriptions to this Cata-
logue collected by the Institution.

Resolved, That it is the sense of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution that the work for the International Catalogue of Scientific Litera-
ture be continued, and that application be made to Congress for a sufficient

annual appropriation to enable this work to be carried on under the direction
of the Institution.

RESOLUTIONS OF THE AERO CLUB.

The Acting Secretary read the following resolutions regarding the
aerodromic work of the late Secretary, which had been adopted by
the Aero Club of America on January 20, 1906:

Whereas our esteemed colleague, Dr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, met with an accident in launching his aerodrome, thereby
missing a decisive test of the capabilities of this man-carrying machine, built
after his models, which flew successfully many times; and

Whereas, in that difficult experiment, he was entitled to fair judgment and
distinguished consideration because of his important achievements in investi-
gating the laws of dynamic fiight, and in the construction of a variety of
successful flying models: Therefore be it
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. xXXI

Resolved, That the Aero Club of America, holding in high estimation the
contributions of Doctor Langley to the science of aerial locomotion, hereby
expresses to him its sincerest appreciation of his labors as a pioneer in this
important and complex science; and

Be it further resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to the Board
of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution and to Doctor Langley.

ELECTION OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE LATE SECRETARY LANGLEY.

May 16, 1906, was fixed by the Board as the date for a special meet-
ing for the election of a Secretary.

successor to Secretary Langley. The Board then went into execu-
tive session, Judge Gray acting as Secretary.

DONATION OF MR. S. P. LANGLEY’S MEDALS AND TOKENS.

The Chancellor read the following memorandum from the Acting
Secretary :

IT am sure you will consider it of interest to announce to the Board of Regents
that the heirs of the late Secretary Langley have presented to the Smithsonian
Institution all of the medals and other tokens received by Mr. Langley in recogni-
tion of his contributions to the advancement of knowledge. Among these are
gold medals from the Royal Society of London, the Institute of France, the
National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

It is proposed to assemble these, together with some of the earlier pieces of
apparatus with which Mr. Langley began his memorable observations on the
physics of the sun, in a case in the National Museum, alongside of those
dedicated to the memory of Professor Henry and Professor Baird.

ELECTION OF A SECRETARY.

The question of the election of a Secretary was then taken up, and,
after discussion, it was “moved by the Vice-President that the
election of a Secretary be postponed to the next regular meeting of
the Board.” So voted.

XXIV REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

That part of the fund deposited in the Treasury of the United
States bears interest at 6 per cent per annum, under the provisions of
the act of August 10, 1846, organizing the Institution, and an act of
Congress approved March 12, 1894. The rate of interest on the West
Shore Railroad bonds is 4 per cent per annum.

By the final settlement of the estate of the late Thomas G. Hodg-
kins during the past year the Institution received, in May, 1906, the
balance of the residuary legacy left by this benefactor. It amounted
to $7,850, in the form of registered bonds of the United States, now
recorded in the name of the Smithsonian Institution, and held subject
to the order of the Board of Regents. Interest had accumulated on
these bonds to the amount of $3,225.55, which sum was paid in cash
and deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of the cur-
rent account of the Institution.

Statement of receipts and disbursements from July 1, 1905, to June 30, 1906.

REP OR f

OF

RICHARD RATHBUN,

ACTING SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
FOR THE

YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1906.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: It is with profound sorrow that I record the death at
Aiken, S. C., on February 27, 1906, of Samuel Pierpont Langley,
Secretary of the Institution since 1887.

This is not the place to give an adequate review of the work of Mr.
Langley as a man of science, or to recall his contributions to the prog-
ress of thought and to the upbuilding of the various scientific insti-
tutions with which he was connected.

I may be permitted, however, to express here my sense of bereave-
ment in the passing away of a man whose friendship and personal
and official confidence I was privileged to enjoy. Although connected
with the Museum and the Institution in one capacity or another for
more than thirty years, my close relations with the late Secretary did
not begin until 1896. Within this decade I learned to know him as a
man of the most profound intellect, an acknowledged master in that
branch of astronomy which he had virtually made his own, and a
pioneer in the difficult subject of mechanical flight. In his youngvr
years he set himself to determine the nature and composition of the
sun, and the properties of heat and light in their relation to life upon
this planet. Later he attacked that fascinating problem, the main-
tenance and progress in the air of bodies many fold heavier than the
medium through which they move.

That he should have investigated these two large difficult subjects
was but typical of his most marked intellectual characteristic, which
required that he knock incessantly upon the doors which were closed
to others. He was equally, if not professionally, concerned with all

sm 1906——1 i!
2 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

the difficulties which had presented themselves to the human intellect
from the abstractions of the mathematician and the metaphysician
to the mysteries of the theologian and the secrets of lost civilizations.

But this great man also lived upon the earth. In his youth and
earlier manhood he had a business training and a business career,
and he carried to the verge of the grave most scrupulously exact
business methods. His theory of administration lay mainly in select-
ing men whom he could trust, and when he found that this trust was
justified, in giving them his unbounded confidence. A man of the
world, he yet retained the simplicity and rigid straightforwardness
of the Puritan character, and though the arts of flattery were un-
known to him, he bound to himself with indissoluble ties of affection,
respect, and loyalty those who had the opportunity of coming
closely in contact with him.

With this Institution he had completely merged his life; not even
his favorite scientific pursuits weighed where the interests of the In-
stitution were concerned; in season and out of season it was the object
of his constant care. To it he added two new and important activi-
ties, the Astrophysical Observatory and the National Zoological
Park. It was during his administration that the Smithson fund
received its only considerable additions since the original gift, and
that the new building for the National Museum was authorized by
Congress.

The elegance of his style in writing and the clearness of his pres-
entation, no matter what the subject might be, greatly enhanced the
Tnstitution’s reputation both here and abroad. Hardly any other
American man of science so frequently met the learned men of the
Old World or received so many distinctions from the academies and
universities and societies of Great Britain and the Continent.

He was not by any means solely devoted to the natural or physical
sciences. The breadth of his knowledge of the things that make for
culture, and especially his interest in the fine arts were almost equal
to his devotion to science, and his wide knowledge of history, though
confined to no one country, was more especially directed to France,
with whose annals and memoirs his acquaintance was almost that of
an expert. His literary sense, not surpassed by even the most culti-
vated of men, took the double direction of an enjoyment of all that
was good in the best of literature, and an attempt to produce writing
on scientific subjects which should be clear and intelligible to the
man of ordinary education, and sometimes even to the child.

Many of these personal characteristics were reflected in the con-
duct of the Institution during his incumbency. The Smithsonian
Report was made more popular in the best sense, conveying exact
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 3

information as to the advancement of science and the progress of
knowledge to all who have an intelligent desire to keep themselves
abreast of the world’s thought.

The fine arts, which were provided for in the original law of the
Institution, and which formed the object of its care at the beginning.
had made but little progress for many years, because of the pressure
of other subjects. He revived interest in this field in the early years
of his administration and his action in this regard was more than
justified by the noteworthy developments in the department of fine
arts here in the past few years, developments which were slowly
taking shape just as his hfe was drawing to a close.

In the passing away of this distinguished man of science, broad
minded, cultivated, this Institution and the world at large lose a
great leader, and the writer of these lines an inspiring guide and a
sincere friend.

Out of respect to his memory the flags on the buildings of the In-
stitution were carried at half mast until after the interment of his
remains at Boston, on March 3. The offices of the Institution were
closed on March 1, on which day the remains arrived in Washington,
and on March 2, the day of the funeral services here. On the latter
day business was also suspended in the offices of the National Mu-
seum, International Exchanges, Bureau of American Ethnology,
National Zoological Park, and Astrophysical Observatory, and dur-
ing the hours of the funeral services the exhibition halls were closed
to the public.

A formal announcement of the death of Secretary Langley was
sent to the foreign correspondents of the Institution, and many ac-
knowledgments have been received, expressing regret at the loss
which the world of science and the Institution have sustained.

In consequence of this sad event, it becomes my duty as Acting
Secretary to submit a report showing the operations of the Institu-
tion during the year ending June 30, 1906, including the work placed
under its direction by Congress in the United States National Mu-
seum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Ex-
changes, the National Zoological Park, and the Astrophysical
Observatory.

In the body of this report there is given a general account of the
affairs of the Institution and its bureaus, while the appendix pre-
sents more detailed statements by those in direct charge of the differ-
ent branches of the work. Independently of this, the operations of
the National Museum and of the Bureau of American Ethnology
are fully treated in separate volumes. The scientific work of the
Astrophysical Observatory is recorded in occasional publications,
4 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY,

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

By act of Congress approved August 10, 1846, the Smithsonian
Institution was created an Establishment. Its statutory members
are “the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and the
heads of Executive Departments.”

As organized on June 30, 1906, the Establishment consisted uf the
following ex officio members:

TueroporEe Roosevett, President of the United States.

Cuartes W. Fatrpanks, Vice-President of the United States.

Metvitte W. Fuuuer, Chief Justice of the United States.

Exinu Root, Secretary of State.

Lesuiz M. Suaw, Secretary of the Treasury.

Wituiam H. Tarr, Secretary of War.

Witu1am H. Moopy, Attorney-General.

GrorcE B. Corteiyou, Postmaster-General.

Cuartes J. Bonaparte, Secretary of the Navy.

Eruan Auten Hircucocn, Secretary of the Interior.

JAMES Witson, Secretary of Agriculture.

Vicror H. Mercatr, Secretary of Commerce and Labor.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Board of Regents consists of the Vice-President and the
Chief Justice of the United States as ex officio members, three mem-
bers of the Senate, three members of the House of Representatives,
and six citizens, “two of whom shall be residents of the city of
Washington, and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State,
but no two of them of the same State.”

The following appointments and reappointments of Regents were
made during the year: By appointment of the Vice-President on
December 7, 1905, Senator. Henry Cabot Lodge in place of Senator
Orville H. Platt, deceased, and Senator A. O. Bacon to succeed
Senator Francis M. Cockrell, whose term of service in the Senate had
expired; by appointment of the Speaker on December 18, 1905,
Representatives R. R. Hitt and Robert Adams, jr., to succeed them-
selves, and Representative W. M. Howard in place of the Hon. Hugh
A. Dinsmore, whose term as Representative had expired. By joint
resolutions of Congress approved February 23 and April 28, 1906,
respectively, the Hon. Richard Olney and Dr. Andrew D. White were
appointed Regents for terms of six years each.
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 5

Tt is with deep regret that I have to record the death of the Hon.
Robert Adams, jr., on June 1, 1906. Mr. Adams was a member of
the Board of Regents on the part of the House of Representatives for
nearly ten years, and always displayed a deep interest in the welfare
of the Institution. He was succeeded by the Hon. John Dalzell, of
Pennsylvania, who was appointed by the Speaker on June 12, 1906.

The membership of the Board at the end of the fiscal year was as
follows:

The Chief Justice, Mr. Melville W. Fuller, Chancellor of the
Institution; the Vice-President, Mr. Charles W. Fairbanks; Senator
S. M. Cullom; Senator Henry Cabot Lodge; Senator A. O. Bacon;
Representative R. R. Hitt; Representative John Dalzell; Repre-
sentative William M. Howard; Dr. James B. Angell, of Michigan;
Dr. Andrew D. White, of New York; the Hon. John B. Henderson,
of the city of Washington; Dr. A. Graham Bell, of the city of Wash-
ington; the Hon. Richard Olney, of Massachusetts, and the Hon.
George Gray, of Delaware.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents held March 12, 1903, the
following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the fourth
Wednesday in January, regular meetings of the Board shall be held on the
Tuesday after the first Monday in December and on the 6th day of March, un-
less that date falls on Sunday, when the following Monday shall be substituted.

In accordance with this resolution the Board met on December 5,
1905, January 24, 1906, and March 6, 1906. A special meeting was
also held on May 16, 1906. The proceedings of the Board at these
meetings will be found in its annual report to Congress.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The year just passed marked an important epoch in the life of the
Smithsonian Institution, the completion of its sixth decade.

Few establishments of learning have secured so wide a recognition
in so limited a time, short in comparison with the history of the older
universities and societies in America and covering but a brief period
in the life of the seats of learning and of the academies of the Old
World. This circumstance is principally due to the fact that no
institution founded in trust ever had so powerful a guardian as the
Government of the United States, and to the stability of policy given
to the Institution by the permanence of position guaranteed to its
head. It is doubtful if any other such organization in this country
can point to sixty years of existence under the direction of but three
men, and probably no other has been presided over in succession by
6 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

three persons of such great distinction as were called to the responsi-
ble position of Secretary.

When James Smithson bequeathed his fortune to the United States
of America to found at Washington an institution for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men, he left the broadest direction
possible for the establishment of an institution of learning. He
placed no restrictions whatever upon the means or methods which
the United States might use in carrying out his noble idea. It is
clear, however, that he had in mind that concrete means must be
employed for accomplishing the purpose of his bequest, and this
was the judgment of the Members of Congress for a period of ten
years, while the subject of the Smithsonian bequest was under dis-
cussion, and of all the distinguished scientific men and educators
whose views were sought prior to final action by the National Legis-
lature. So broad was the idea that it required to be interpreted and
defined lest the energies exercised under the fund be scattered in
many directions and prove wasteful and ineffective. As long as the
two purposes were kept in mind, namely, to increase the sum total
of human knowledge and to spread it abroad, the objects of the be-
quest were being accomplished.

Congress in the act of foundation directed that the sum of nearly a
quarter of a million of dollars of interest, which had accrued since the
receipt of the bequest, be appropriated for the erection of a suitable
building, at once giving to the new institution a local habitation
and a name, and it prescribed, moreover, to what purposes this
building should be put—a museum, a chemical laboratory, a library,
a gallery of art, and lecture rooms. The law at once stamped the
Institution with a national character by declaring that for exhibition
in this building there be delivered over to the Institution all museum
objects belonging to the United States which were in the city of
Washington, and made the Institution coequal with the Library
of Congress in the matter of receiving copyright books, engravings,
and other articles. This act, however, comprehensive as it was,
required further interpretation, and in addition to the purposes
so clearly set forth it was decided to offer prizes for original
memoirs, to make grants for special objects of research, and to
diffuse knowledge by publishing a series of reports giving an account
of new discoveries in science as well as separate treatises on subjects
of general interest.

In brief, the new institution was to take upon itself the functions
of a great museum representing the sciences, the arts, and the indus-
tries; a gallery of art; a library; an academy stimulating research
and issuing publications, and a publishing house for the populari-
zation of knowledge, and all these upon an income of what was then
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. fg

not much more than $30,000 per annum. Nevertheless all these
activities were undertaken and more not named were added, and
by great economy and through the then larger purchasing power
of money they were carried on with credit. Moreover, in view of
the absence of many national scientific institutions which have since
grown up, the Smithsonian, through its Secretary, was for a long
period the general adviser of the Government in scientific matters.
He served on the Light-House Board; he was called upon to make
experiments to improve the acoustic properties of the Capitol; in
times of war he advised in ordnance matters, whilst at different
periods the several secretaries took up such large questions as the
study of meteorology and the making of meteorological observations
all over the United States, finally resulting in the formation of the
United States Weather Bureau; the artificial propagation of food
fishes and the investigation of problems relating to ichthyology in
their bearing upon the fisheries, resulting in the establishment of the
Bureau of Fisheries; or so large a problem as the practical use for
the purposes of war of the principle discovered in connection with
the maintenance and flight of heavy bodies through the air.

As Congress and the people generally realized that the programme
of operations was vastly larger than was commensurate with the
income from the fund, they endowed this ward of the Government
by annual budgets and thus made what was originally a compara-
tively small museum a great museum of the nation; provided for
the system of exchanges of Government and scientific publications
between this country and other countries; maintained ethnological
and archeological work on a considerable scale; established a splen-
did home for the custody of living animals, at once serving for the
recreation and instruction of the people and affording valuable ma-
terial for students; and within the past year has assisted in a vast
scheme of cooperative international bibliographical work, which had
its inception in a suggestion made by the first Secretary in 1855. In
this and in other ways has the Government aided in carrying out
the conditions which it imposed upon the Smithson bequest, coming
more and more to the help of the Institution, and making its own
fund freer for that portion of its programme of work which has to
do with research and publication and the general diffusion of
knowledge.

By a gradual and wise development of the system of administra-
tion the four or five activities of the Institution have been put into
separate groups, each with a responsible head answerable to the Sec-
retary, which renders possible the greatest freedom of action and
judgment consistent with an orderly and harmonious organization.
Thus, at the end of sixty years, it may be said with truth that the

name of the Smithsonian is a household word throughout the United
States, that it has been carried to every land where civilization
exists, and that the benefits of this foundation, while naturally inur-
ing most strongly to the people of the land in which the establish-
ment was created, are yet truly extended to all men, and that the
United States, through its legislative and executive branches of the
Government, through the distinguished men who have served upon
the Board of Regents, and the great scientific leaders and thinkers—
Henry, Baird, and Langley—has rendered to the world at large a
more than faithful account of its stewardship of this unique bequest.

ADMINISTRATION.

The duties of the Secretary during his absence in the summer and
from the time when his final illness began, in November, 1905, were
performed by Mr. Richard Rathbun, an assistant secretary of the
Institution, by designation of the Chancellor under authority of
the act of May 13, 1884, providing for the appointment of an acting
secretary. That the work progressed so well is due to the hearty
support given by the entire staff in what proved to be one of the
most trying years in the history of the Institution.

Dr. Cyrus Adler entered upon the discharge of his duties as
assistant secretary in charge of library and exchanges on July 1, 1905,
and on the same date Mr. F. W. Hodge, who, for about four years,
had served as acting curator of exchanges and assistant in charge of
the Smithsonian office, resumed his duties as ethnologist in the Bureau
of American Ethnology.

It is gratifying to report that the current business of the Institu-
tion was conducted in a prompt and efficient manner, and that no
arrearages in the work of the Government branches under its di-
rection had to be noted in the quarterly statements made to the Presi-
dent and the annual statement made to Congress in accordance with
law.

As has been customary, the estimates submitted to Congress in
October, 1905, were accompanied by a letter explaining concisely but
as forcibly as possible the reasons for requesting the amounts named
in connection with each item. In the hearings on these estimates
before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations,
which occupied the greater part of two days in April, 1906, the
workings of the Institution and its branches were fully discussed,
und it is my opinion that the importance of the activities conducted
under the direction of the Board of Regents is well appreciated by
the members of that subcommittee.
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 9

In accordance with an enactment of Congress, the Government
branches of the Institution join with the Executive Departments in
drawing up each year a list of the more important supplies required
during the next twelve months. Proposals are thereupon requested
and awards are made to the lowest bidders. Reduced prices are
secured in this manner and the machinery of purchasing is greatly
simplified. The parent Institution has been privileged to share in
this arrangement, greatly to its advantage.

FINANCES.

The permanent fund of the Institution and the sources from which
it was derived are as follows:

Deposited in the Treasury of the United States.

That part of the fund deposited in the Treasury of the United
States bears interest at 6 per cent per annum, under the provisions of
the act organizing the Institution and an act of Congress approved
March 12, 1894. The rate of interest on the West Shore Railroad
bonds is 4 per cent per annum.

By the final settlement of the estate of the late Thomas G. Hodg-
kins during the past year the Institution received, in May, 1906, the
balance of the residuary legacy left by this benefactor. It amounted
to $7,850, in the form of registered bonds of the United States, now
recorded in the name of the Smithsonian Institution, and held sub-
ject to the order of the Board of Regents. Interest had accumulated
on these bonds to the amount of $3,225.55, which sum was paid in
10 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

cash and deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of the
current account of the Institution.

The income of the Institution during the year amounted to
$67,588.08, derived as follows: From interest on the permanent fund,
€57,900; from interest on the Hodgkins residuary legacy, $3,225.55 ;
from .rentals, $437.53; from miscellaneous sources, $6,025—all of
which were deposited to the current-fund account in the Treasury
of the United States, which, through the courtesy of the Treasurer,
is now receiving and collecting miscellaneous checks for the Institu-
tion, thus making unnecessary the intermediary of a bank. With
the addition of the nominal balance of $5,153.92, brought forward
from the previous year, the total credits for the year reached
$72,742. The disbursements, which will be given in detail in the
report of the executive committee, amounted to $62,557.87, leaving
a credit balance on June 30, 1906, of $10,184.13.

Mr. W. I. Adams, chief clerk of the International Exchanges, was
on June 12, 1905, appointed accountant of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and disbursing agent for the Government appropriations for
the National Museum, the International Exchanges, the Bureau of
American Ethnology, the Astrophysical Observatory, the National
Zoological Park, and such other objects as may from time to time be
placed by Congress under the direction of the Institution.

Certain additional safeguards suggested by experience were
adopted early in the fiscal year for the protection of the funds of
the Institution and the Government.

The Institution was charged by Congress with the disbursement of
the following appropriations for the year ending June 30, 1906:

RESEARCHES.

The fact that at the beginning of the fiscal year there were no
funds to the credit of the current income of the Institution rendered
it prudent that new research work should not be entered upon until
at least a slight surplus to the credit of the Institution should
have been accumulated in the Treasury. Accordingly, no enter-
prises of this character were initiated during the year, and for the
same reason publications in the Smithsonian series proper were
suspended for several months. Such investigations as were in
progress, however, were continued, and all obligations which had
been incurred for grants or publications were met.

SMITHSONIAN GRANTS.

Prof. A. M. Reese, of Syracuse University, who had received a
moderate grant from the Institution for the purpose of collecting
material for an embryological study of the alligator, submitted
in August, 1905, an interesting account of the results of his field
work in Florida. A series of nearly 300 embryos was gathered.
comprising practically all the stages of development except the
very early ones, which Professor Reese proposes to obtain later.
Strangely enough, very little has been made known regarding the
embryology of this large reptile, once so common in our southern
12 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY,

waters, and the material now at command will thus furnish the
means for an original biological investigation of much importance.

Dr. Edward L. Greene, who, as noted in previous reports, has in
course of preparation a paper to be entitled “‘ Landmarks of Botan-
ical History,” reports satisfactory progress. The completed manu-
script is to be submitted early in 1907, and it is believed that the
intimate knowledge of the history of botany possessed by Doctor
Greene will render its publication of great value to students in this
branch of science.

The International Fishery Congress will hold its fourth general
meeting in the city of Washington during the summer of 1908, and to
enhance the interest in its proceedings prizes for contributions of
merit have been offered by a number of organizations and individ-
uals. In view of the importance of the occasion the Institution has
tendered an award of $200 for the best essay or treatise on “ Inter-
national Regulations of the Fisheries on the High Seas, their His-
tory, Objects, and Results.”

HODGKINS FUND.

Several important investigations are in progress under grants
from the Hodgkins fund of the Institution, the results of which have
not yet been fully reported. The conclusion of others has been un-
expectedly delayed, and these will properly be summarized in a later
report.

In March, 1906, Dr. R. von Lendenfeld announced the conclusion
of the second part of the investigations on the organs of flight car-
ried on under his direction. It relates to the air sacs of birds, and
was conducted by Mr. Bruno Miiller, whose report has been submitted
and approved for publication by the Institution.

Another paper, on the wings of hymenopterous insects, prepared
under the same supervision by Dr. Leo Walter, has also been received.

The investigation of Prof. W. P. Bradley, of Wesleyan University,
to determine the relation between the initial and the final tempera-
ture of air which in flowing through a nozzle passes from a high
pressure to a lower is reported as progressing satisfactorily. Oppos-
ing theories being held as to the physical principle involved in this
type of expansion, special interest is felt in these experiments, and
while they are not yet sufficiently advanced for a definite conclusion
to be drawn from them, the present results are such as to justify a
second moderate grant for their continuance during the coming year.
It may be added that this investigation is expected to form an
important part of an extended inquiry into the factors which make
for efficiency in an air liquefier.
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 13

Under a grant from this fund Mr. A. Lawrence Rotch, director of
the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, was enabled to continue the
ascensions of ballons-sondes at St. Louis during the different seasons
of the year and so to ascertain the annual variation of temperature
im the free air at great heights. Twelve balloons were dispatched
in July, 1905, and all but two of the attached instruments were
recovered. Their automatic records of barometric pressure and air
temperature showed an extreme height of nearly 10 miles, with
the lowest temperature of 74° F. below zero at a less altitude. The
place and time of the descent indicated the average direction and
speed of the air currents. All of the last 21 balloons and instru-
ments, sent up in April and May, 1906, were returned, some of them
having risen 10 miles and encountered a temperature of 85° F. below
zero 8 miles above the earth. At about 7 miles a relatively warm
stratum was entered, which was found to be at a higher level in the
summer and autumn.

In April, 1906, a Hodgkins grant was requested by Mr. S. P. Fer-
gusson, assistant at the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, for a
study of the differences between the meteorological conditions on the
summits of mountains and at the same height in free air. An inves-
tigation of this nature being important in its bearings on dynamic
meteorology, a small grant to aid in the purchase of the necessary
apparatus was approved.

The apparatus adapted and arranged by Mr. Alexander Larsen
for experiments in photographing the spectrum of lightning has been
materially improved during the year and the results carefully re-
ported. Several interesting photographs have been received from
Mr. Larsen, although the conditions have been generally unfavorable
throughout the season for securing such, as the electrical storms,
which would have furnished them, have taken place in the daytime.
The research will continue to be prosecuted as occasion offers. A
paper by Mr. Larsen on photographing lightning flashes by a moving
camera is included in the general appendix of the Smithsonian
Report for 1905.

In May, 1906, a Hodgkins grant was approved on behalf of Prof.
E. L. Nichols, of Cornell University, for an investigation on the
properties of matter at the temperature of liquid air. The impor-
tanee to the physicist and chemist of this field of research, which
greatly extends the range of temperatures throughout which investi-
gations on the properties of matter can be conducted, is recognized,
and the Institution expects that the experiments to be prosecuted
under the supervision of Professor Nichols will mark a definite ad-
vance in scientific knowledge in this direction. The outline of work
already submitted notes progress in several interesting researches.
14 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

Preliminary measurements testing the method employed in experi-
ments on the heat of vaporization and specific heat at constant pres-
sure of air, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen have been successfully
conducted, and plans are making to extend the investigation to other
gases.

The method employed in an investigation to determine the coeffi-
cient of expansion of metals and other substances at low tempera-
tures makes use of the interference of light, and, being of extraor-
dinary delicacy, possesses the advantage of permitting the determi-
nation of the expansion in detail throughout the entire range of
temperature, instead of giving merely the mean coefficient between
fixed points of widely different temperatures. The results already
obtained in the case of gold, silver, aluminum, and glass are of an
interesting and unexpected character, and it is the intention to
extend the experiments to other substances and temperatures. A
set of measurements on the Hall effect in tellurium at the tem-
perature of liquid air has been completed during the year, and
preparations are already in progress for the study of the Hall
effect and of electric properties in general of silicon, tungsten,
manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and other substances which
have only recently become available. An extended investigation
on the effect of temperature upon the magnetic properties of cer-
tain steels is reported by Professor Nichols as in progress and
promises interesting results.

NAPLES TABLE,

The applications for occupancy of the Smithsonian table at the
Naples Zoological Station during the past year have been numerous,
and the appointments approved for the period from July 1, 1905,
to June 30, 1906, aggregated sixteen months. Such action has
been made possible through the courtesy of Doctor Dohrn, the
director, who has on several occasions permitted the attendance
of two Smithsonian representatives at the same time. As hereto-
fore, the reports submitted by various occupants of the Smithsonian
table mention with appreciation the excellent management of the
station, and the unremitting efforts of all connected with it to
further the work of investigators.

Dr. Stewart Paton, formerly of the teaching staff of Johns Hop-
kins University, who occupied the table for six months beginning
November 1, 1905, secured an extension of his time through June and
July, 1906. His researches relate to problems of fundamental impor-
tance in connection with the structure, development, and function
of the nerves, and their relation to the cardiac movements. It is
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 15

gratifying to state that he reports success in demonstrating the
presence at an early period in the embryo of a nervous system far
more complicated than was previously believed to exist. In sub-
mitting an outline of his investigation, Doctor Paton applied for re-
appointment for an additional period and his request has been
approved for five months, from October 1, 1906, to February 28,
1907. A monograph collating the results of the entire research will
be published on its completion.

Mr. W. B. Bell, fellow in zoology in the State University of Iowa,
had the use of the Naples table for three months from the Ist of
July, 1905. His time was largely occupied in the preparation of
embryological material for later study, relative to the hermit crab,
Eupagurus prideauxtt Bell. He will report at a future time upon
the results of his investigation.

Although the table was already occupied by a Smithsonian repre-
sentative, Dr. Harold Heath, associate professor in Leland Stanford
Junior University, was received at the station for three months from
January 15, 1906, and Dr. E. L. Mellus, of Baltimore, for the
months of January and February, 1906, both being appointees of
the Institution. Doctor Heath proposed while at Naples to conduct
researches on the development of the ctenophore hydroids and on
the body cavity of certain invertebrates. Formal reports, however,
have not yet been received from either of these gentlemen.

Dr. M. M. Metcalf, from 1893 to 1906, professor of biology in the
Woman’s College of Baltimore, and now professor elect of zoology
in Oberlin College, has received the appointment to the Smithsonian
table for the months of March and April, 1907. It is Doctor Met-
calf’s intention to study the early development of the nervous system
in the asexual reproduction of Salpa, to make observations upon
certain species of the Ama@ba, and to search for indications of conju-
gating flagellispores similar to those noted in a fresh-water species
which he has heretofore examined.

Thanks are again due to Dr. J. S. Billings, Dr. E. B. Wilson,
Dr. Theodore Gill, and Dr. C. W. Stiles, who constitute the Naples
Table Advisory Committee, for continued prompt and courteous
aid in passing upon the qualifications of applicants for the Smith-
sonian table at the station.

The National Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology
of the Institution have carried on numerous biological, geological,
and ethnological researches, described elsewhere in this report. Im-
portant investigations by the Astrophysical Observatory on the
absorption of the solar envelope and on solar radiation have been
continued, and will be referred to later.
16 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY,
PUBLICATIONS.

It is mainly through its publications that that vital principle of
the Institution, “ the diffusion of knowledge among men,” is carried
out. The institution proper maintains three regular series of publi-
cations, the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, the Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections, and the Annual Reports, while
under its auspices are issued the annual reports, proceedings, and
bulletins of the National Museum, the reports and bulletins of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Annals of the Astrophysical
Observatory, the whole presenting a fund of information covering
a wide range of human knowledge in both a specialized and general
form.

The Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, now in their thirty-
fourth volume, are restricted to the publication of positive additions
to human knowledge resting on original research, all unverified
speculations being rejected. The Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions are designed to contain reports on the present state of our
knowledge in particular branches of science, instructions for collect-
ing and digesting facts and materials for research, lists and synopses
of species of the organic and inorganic world, reports of explora-
tions, and aids to bibliographical investigations. This series is now
in its forty-ninth volume, and in the Quarterly Issue provision has
been made for the early publication of short papers descriptive of
new discoveries or containing information of current interest in all
departments of science.

These two series of publications are printed at the expense of the
Institution. Owing, however, to the lack of funds heretofore men-
tioned, their issuance was necessarily suspended during the early part
of the year, but toward the close there was a partial resumption of
the work. The printing of the memoir on “Atmospheric Nuclea-
tion,” by Dr. Carl Barus, in the Contributions, was completed, and
several papers were published in connection with the Quarterly
Tssue.

The last edition of the Smithsonian Geographical Tables having
been exhausted, a new one, embodying some minor corrections by
the author, Prof. R. S. Woodward, now president of the Carnegie
Institution, was put to press near the end of the year. A revision of
the Meteorological Tables, for which there is also a great demand,
is in course of preparation.

There is under consideration a request that Bowen’s Vocabulary
of the Yoruba languages, published by the Institution in 1858, be
reprinted for the use of missionaries in the Yoruba country of West
Africa, those making the proposition regarding it as the most
useful and accurate book dealing with the various phases of Yoruba
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 17

life. It is interesting to note that a work of this character, issued
by the Smithsonian nearly fifty years ago, should still remain a
standard of authority.

In view of the increased interest and importance attaching to
the subject of earthquakes on account of the disaster to San Fran-
cisco and its vicinity on April 18, 1906, it has been decided to pub-
lish a supplement to the “ Catalogue of Earthquakes on the Pacific
Coast from 1769 to 1897,” compiled by Dr. E. S. Holden and pub-
lished in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections in 1898. The
work will be prepared by an official of the United States Weather
Bureau, and will bring the subject down to date. Through the
courtesy of the Department of State and of the Hydrographic Office
of the Navy Department, the Institution has also received informa-
tion regarding recent earthquakes in Venezuela and other regions,
which is available for publication.

The annual report of the Board of Regents to Congress, which is
printed at the Government Printing Office, has been the chief
medium through which the Institution has been enabled to dissemi-
nate scientific information to the world at large. Besides the offi-
cial account of the operations of the Institution, this report has
for over half a century included a general appendix giving a record
of the progress in different branches of knowledge, compiled largely
from journals in foreign languages, and the transactions of scientific
and learned societies throughout the world. The considerable num-
ber of copies of this publication placed by Congress at the dis-
posal of the Institution has rendered possible a wide distribution
to important libraries and institutions of learning, but the allot-
ment is wholly insufficient to supply more than a small fraction
of the individual requests, and the popular demand for the volume
has so constantly increased that the entire edition of each year’s
report is exhausted within a few months of its appearance.

The Proceedings of the United States National Museum, the first
volume of which was issued in 1878, are intended as a medium for
the publication of original papers based on the collections of the
Museum, setting forth newly acquired facts in biology, anthropology,
and geology, or containing descriptions of new forms and revisions
of limited groups. A volume is issued annually or oftener, for dis-
tribution to libraries and scientific establishments, and in view ot
the importance of the more prompt dissemination of new facts, a
limited edition of each paper is printed in pamphlet form in advance.
The dates at which these separate papers are published are recorded
in the table of contents of the volume. The Museum Bulletins,
publication of which was begun in 1875, comprise a series of more
elaborate papers, issued separately, and, like the Proceedings, based
chiefly, if not wholly, on the collections of the Museum. A quarto

sm 1906——2
18 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

form of the bulletin, known as the “Special Bulletin,” has been
adopted in a few instances in which a larger size of plate was deemed
indispensable. Since 1902 the volumes of the series known as “ Con-
tributions from the National Herbarium,” and containing papers
relating to the botanical collections of the Museum, have been pub-
lished as bulletins.

The annual report of the Museum is printed as a separate volume
of the report of the Board of Regents to Congress.

The publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology, consist-
ing of annual reports and bulletins, relate to the operations of the
Bureau in its various branches of exploration and research. The
most important work now in course of printing is a bulletin in two
volumes entitled “* Handbook of the Indians,” which will contain a
summary of all the information collected regarding the Indian tribes
of the United States, arranged in alphabetical sequence for conven-
ience of reference.

Volume I of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory was pub-
lished in 1900. A second volume, which has been in preparation
for some time, is nearly ready for the press. It will discuss the con-
tinuation of the work of the Observatory in Washington and also
the investigations on solar radiation conducted by a Smithsonian
party at the solar observatory of the Carnegie Institution on Mount
Wilson, California.

Two memoirs by the late Secretary Langley, entitled “ Experi-
ments in Aerodynamics” and “ The Internal Work of the Wind,”
were printed in 1891 and 1893, respectively, as parts of Volume
X XVII of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. A third
paper, dealing with later experiments on the same subject, was to
complete the volume. At the time of Mr. Langley’s demise the man-
uscript was mostly prepared, but it required revision and the writing
of several chapters on the engineering part of the work; and by an
arrangement with Mr. Charles M. Manly. who was for a number
of vears Mr. Langley’s chief assistant in aerodynamics, the memoir
has been placed in his hands for completion.

The Annual Report of the American Historical Association for
che year 1905 was transmitted to Congress on May 14, 1906, under the
requirements of the act of incorporation of the association. The
Smithsonian Institution is by law allowed a number of copies of the
reports of this association, which are distributed in exchange for the
publications of various foreign and American historical secieties.

There was also forwarded to Congress the eighth report of the
National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, in
accordance with the act of incorporation of that organization.

In order that the practice of the Institution in the supervision of
its publications might correspond with that of the Executive Depart-
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 19

ments as prescribed in the President’s order of January 24, 1906, an
advisory committee on printing and publication was appointed by
the Acting Secretary on February 7, 1906, whose personnel is as
follows:

Dr. Cyrus Adler, Assistant Secretary, chairman; Dr. I. W. True,
of the United States National Museum; Mr. F. W. Hedge, of the
Bureau of American Ethnology; Dr. Frank Baker, of the National
Zoological Park; Mr. C. G. Abbot, of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory; Mr. W. I. Adams, of the International Exchanges; and Mr.
A. Howard Clark, of the Smithsonian Institution.

The committee has held twenty-six meetings and has examined and
reported on fifty-four manuscripts submitted for publication, be-
sides numerous blank forms to be printed for use in the bureaus of
the Institution. It has also advised the Acting Secretary on many
matters connected with the question of printing and binding.

For the guidance of the several branches of the Institution in the
preparation of manuscript and the correction of proofs the following
rules, recommended by the advisory committee, were issued in March,
1906:

1. Typewritten copy is preferred. Ordinary manuscript will be accepted if
the handwriting is clearly legible throughout.

2. The sheets of manuscripts should be of uniform size and consecutively
numbered. The writing should be on one side of the sheets only.

3. The subject-matter of manuscripts should be maturely considered and
earefully revised by authors, everything unnecessary and irrelevant being ex-
cluded. Particular attention should be paid to paragraphing, punctuation,
the insertion of side headings, references to illustrations, etc., as only a limited
amount of correction in these particulars will be allowed in proof.

4. The whole of the manuscript must be submitted at one time, and with it
all the tables and illustrations that are to be used.

5. Illustrations should be used only when necessary for the elucidation of
the text; never for mere embeliishment. The copy for colored or other expen-
sive illustrations should not be prepared, nor should they be employed, without
special authority.

6. A list of illustrations, giving their titles in brief and such explanations as
may be necessary, should accompany the manuscript. Upon each illustration
should be noted its number and a reference to the manuscript page to which it
relates. The places where plate and figure references are to be inserted in the
text should be indicated in the manuscript.

7. The use of tables should be avoided whenever it is practicable to present
results in a summarized form, and all tables should be condensed as far as pos
sible.

8. In order to avoid unnecessary work in the preparation of extended treatises,
authors are urgently recommended to submit in advance to the head of the
bureau to which such treatise pertains an outline in writing of its proposed
contents, stating the probable size of the manuscript and the number of illustra-
tions required. Extended treatises should be accompanied with a table of con-
tents in which the relative importance of headings is indicated.

9. Galley proof, upon which reasonable corrections and indispensable addi-
tlons may be made, will be sent to the authors whenever practicable. If in
20 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

correcting proof an author exceeds what seems to the editor reasonable, the
latter will exercise his discretion as to the revisions to be accepted. No mate-
rial changes will be permitted in page proof.

10. Editors employed under the Smithsonian Institution are required to see
that manuscripts conform with the foregoing rules before they are sent to press.
If this can not be accomplished by conference with the author, the matter must
be referred to the head of the bureau under which the manuscript is to be
published.

11. When ready for the press, the editor wil! send manuscripts to the head of
the bureau to which they pertain, with a statement that they are in every
respect ready for the printer and that the accompanying illlustrations are
necessary.

12. An editor shall not depart from the form established for any series of
publications without the knowledge and consent of the head of the bureau under
which he is employed. When a departure from approved standards of publica-
tions seems desirable, the editor should obtain a sample page for criticism and
approval before the printing proceeds.

18. It is the duty of editors to see that copy for illustrations is suitable in
kind and quality for the processes of reproduction proposed to be employed,
and also to see that figures (especially those in outline) are reduced to a size
as small as practicable for the purpose intended. All illustrations should be
marked to show the size and the process of reproduction desired.

14. Editors should see that every volume is supplied with a suitable index.

Upon the recommendation of the International Commission on
Zoologieal Nomenclature that genera hereafter described be assigned
a type species, a rule was issued on April 3, 1906, providing that
“a type species shall be designated for every new genus of animal
or plant proposed in the publications of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and it shall be the duty of the editors to see that no new
genera are published without such designation.”

Two important laws relating to public printing were passed by
Congress at the last session and approved by the President on
March 30, 1906. One of these provides that from the general ap-
propriation for public printing and binding an allotment shall be
made to each Department or independent office of the Government,
and that to each shall be charged the first cost of publishing all
reports emanating from such Department or office. The custom
heretofore has been to charge the entire cost of all public docu-
ments, except in a few specific cases, against the general appro-
priation without restricting the Departments in this particular.

The other law prevents accumulations of large numbers of docu-
ments by providing that they shall be printed in several editions
as the demand may require, the total number, however, not to
exceed that authorized by law.

The first of these laws rendered it necessary that the allotment
made annually to the Institution for printing the proceedings and
bulletins of the Museum be extended to include the cost of the an-
nual reports of the Institution and Museum, the reports of the
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 21

American Historical Association, and the reports and bulletins of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, all of which had previously
been printed under the general appropriation for public printing
and binding. The allotment made for these objects for the year
ending June 30, 1907, aggregates $70,000, itemized as follows:

For the Smithsonian Institution, for printing and binding the annual
reports of the Board of Regents, with general appendixes___________ $10, 000
Under the Smithsonian Institution, for the annual reports of the
National Museum, with general appendixes, and for the annual re-
port of the American Historical Association, and for printing labels
and blanks, and for the bulletins and proceedings of the National
Museum, the editions of which shall not exceed 4,000 copies, and
binding, in half turkey or material not more expensive, scientific
books and pamphlets presented to and acquired by the National

THE LIBRARY.

The total accessions during the year to the Smithsonian deposit in
the Library of Congress and to the libraries of the Secretary’s office,
the Astrophysical Observatory, the National Museum, and the Na-
tional Zoological Park aggregated 33,358. There were also nu-
merous additions to the library of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, which is separately administered.

One of the most important acquisitions was a unique Tibetan
manuscript entitled “ Transcendental Wisdom,” received as a gift
from the government of India, which has been deposited in the Na-
tional Museum. A notable gift to the Museum library was the work
descriptive of the Heber R. Bishop collection of jades and other hard
stones. This publication, which was presented by the Bishop estate,
is in two volumes of extraordinary size, prepared in the highest
style of the bookmaker’s art, the edition being limited to 100 copies.
The Gen. John Watts de Peyster hbrary on Napoleon and other sub-
jects was increased by 1,234 volumes.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

The International Catalogue of Scientific Literature is a classified
authors’ and subject catalogue of all original scientific papers pub-
lished throughout the world. The organization consists of bureaus,
established in each of the civilized countries, whose duty it is to
furnish references to the scientific publications issued within their
several regions, these references being assembled, edited, and pub-
lished in seventeen annual volumes by a central bureau in London.

The cost of printing and publishing is met by the subscribers to
the Catalogue, and American scientific universities, libraries, and
22 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

scientific societies alone have shown their appreciation of the work
by making advance subscriptions amounting to over $30,000. The
cost of collecting and indexing the material for the Catalogue is in
each case borne by the countries taking part in the work and is for
the most part derived from direct governmental grants.

The work has been going on since 1901, the organization having
published up to the present time sixty-seven volumes. In the begin-
ning of the undertaking the Smithsonian Institution, realizing the
value and importance of the work, undertook to represent the United
States, and each year made a small allotment to temporarily conduct
it here. As it was realized that even the small sum which the Insti-
tution was able to devote to this purpose was a serious drain on its
resources, the Board of Regents on March 6, 1906, adopted the fol-
lowing resolution :

Resolved. That it is the sense of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution that the work of the International Catalogue of Scientific Litera-
ture be continued, and that application be made to Congress for a sufficient
annual appropriation to enable this work to be carried on under the direction
of the Institution.

The Acting Secretary, in carrying out the directions of the Board
of Regents, submitted an estimate of $5,000 to provide for the neces-
sary expenses, which amount was appropriated in the sundry civil
bill and became available on July 1, 1906.

The magnitude of the work will be appreciated when it is said
that since the beginning of the undertaking in 1901 the London
Central Bureau has received for publication over 750,000 reference
cards, of which 92.492 were furnished by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, representing the original contributions of American scholars to
the natural and physical sciences.

The limited funds at the disposal of the Institution have consid-
erably delayed and embarrassed the work in this country. The sys-
tem as at present organized is, however, capable of expansion at any
time, either into fields not at present embraced within the scope of the
work or in adding to the manner of presenting the index. Monthly
or quarterly cards or pamphlets might, for instance, be published
immediately after the appearance of the publications indexed, but
such methods would only serve as adjuncts to the volumes, which
would always be the permanent records.

Recently a plan has been adopted whereby authors of papers are in
special cases communicated with, in order that through cooperation
the subject-matter may be completely treated from the point of view
of both the author and the bibliographer. While this method entails
considerable clerical work, the results seem to justify the effort.
Another plan which is being gradually worked out is to send to each
author from time to time a list of his papers which have been indexed
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 23

at the Institution for the Catalogue, with the request that attention
be called to any omission or errors. ‘These two plans, were it possible
to devote sufficient time to them, would render the work as exact as
it is possible to make a complex index. Besides the value of these
plans for the Catalogue itself, they keep the Institution in relation
with the entire body of scientific workers in the United States and
incidentally result in considerable accessions to the Library.

The supreme control of the Catalogue is vested in an international
convention, and during the interval between two successive meet-
ings of the convention the administration is conducted by an inter-
national council. A meeting of the International Convention was
held in London in July, 1905, and was attended by Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger, of the United States National Museum, as delegate of
the Smithsonian Institution. In view of the success already achieved
by the Catalogue, the convention determined to continue it for a
further period of at least five years.

PRESERVATION OF AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES.

For several years there has been increasing necessity for legisla-
tion to prevent the wanton destruction of the interesting aboriginal
ruins in the southwestern part of the United States, and a law, ap-
proved June 8, 1906, prohibits the excavation, injury, or destruction
of any prehistoric ruin or monument on lands under the control
of the United States without the permission of the secretary of the
Department of the Government having jurisdiction. It further
provides that the President may by proclamation declare such his-
toric sites and prehistoric structures to be national monuments.

The sundry civil act approved June 30, 1906, contains an appro-
priation of $3,000, to be expended under the supervision of the Sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution for the protection of the Casa
Grande ruin in Pinal County, near Florence, Arizona, and for exca-
vations on the reservation.

GIFTS TO THE INSTITUTION.

The Institution has from the beginning been the recipient of many
gifts from individuals and establishments, but these have not been
enumerated in detail in the Secretary’s report. The donations of
books and pamphlets are referred to in the report of the Library,
and of objects and specimens in that of the Museum, while the two
large collections of art acquired during the year are discussed on a
subsequent page under the heading “ National Gallery of Art.”

Mention should be made here, however, of the fact that the heirs
of Secretary Langley presented to the Institution the medals and
24 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY,

tokens received by him in recognition of his contributions to the ad-
vancement of knowledge, including the Rumford gold medals from
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Society
of London, the Henry Draper gold medal from the National Acad-
emy of Sciences, and the gold medal from the Academy of Sciences
of the Institute of France, and also the Rumford silver medals from
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Society
of London.

CORRESPONDENCE.

One of the important duties of the Institution is the conduct of its
correspondence, not alone such as relates to its administrative affairs,
but likewise to the mass of inquiries received from all parts of the
country and indeed from every quarter of the globe, regarding al-
most every conceivable subject. It is not the policy of the Institu-
tion to encourage such requests unless they pertain to matters in-
cluded within its scope, in which event, however, every effort is made
to improve the opportunity for increasing or diffusing knowledge in
accordance with the prime purposes of its foundation. Inquiries
relating to subjects within the scope of other governmental agencies
are referred to the proper sources of information and the writers so
informed, but the amount of correspondence along legitimate lines of
inquiry is very great and entails much labor upon both the scientific
and the clerical staffs.

In addition to the correspondence handled directly from the offices
of the Institution proper, each of the bureaus under its direction con-
ducts its own correspondence with large numbers of individuals and
institutions desiring information upon the subjects to which their
activities relate. The National Museum, for example, sends out
annually thousands of letters concerning specimens transmitted for
identification and a knowledge of their characteristics, while the
National Zoological Park disseminates much valuable data regarding
living animals. A large amount of authentic information about the
American Indian, present and past, emanates annually from the
Bureau of American Ethnology of this Institution. There is also a
growing public interest in matters relating to astrophysics, and to the
component elements in the sun and other celestial bodies, as mani-
fested in a rapid increase in the amount of correspondence received
by the Institution regarding this branch of scientific investigation.

Numerous letters are received from inventors making application
for grants of money with which to develop their various devices, or
asking an expression of the Institution’s opinion as to the merits of
their respective inventions. The Institution has no funds from
which such aid can be given, and the Secretary is, moreover, obliged
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 25

to refuse all requests for an opinion in these matters, since such
action is prohibited by a decision of the Board of Regents. The In-
stitution furthermore does not endeavor to supply information of
a commercial nature, such as is customarily furnished for a fee by
engineers or other professional advisers.

In spite of these restrictions, however, the correspondence is, as
has been stated, an important agency in the diffusion of knowledge.

EXPOSITIONS, CONGRESSES, AND CELEBRATIONS.

Expositions.—The Institution and its bureaus were represented at
the Lewis and Clark Exposition, held in Portland, Oregon, from June
1 to October 15, 1905, mainly by a selection from the objects which
had been exhibited at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, as nar-
rated, on a subsequent page, in the report of the representative Dr.
Frederick W. True.

Models of the Langley aerodrome, some photographs and books,
and a number of plane surfaces and other apparatus were lent for an
exhibition by the Aero Club of America, held in New York from
January 138 to 20, 1906. This club subsequently adopted a series of
resolutions expressing its appreciation of the important achieve-
ments of Secretary Langley in investigating the laws of dynamic
flight and in the construction of a series of working models which
on trial had successfully demonstrated the principles of mechanical
flight.

Congresses.—The Institution was invited to participate in a num-
ber of international congresses including the Congress of Anthro-
pology and Prehistoric Archeology, held in Monaco in April, 1906,
but the duties of the staff were so exacting during the year that it
was found impossible to detail any of its members to be present at
these important scientific gatherings.

Franklin celebration—The two hundredth anniversary of the
birth of Benjamin Franklin was celebrated at Philadelphia by the
American Philosophical Society, from April 17 to 20, 1906, the
Institution being represented by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a
Regent. A formal address, suitably engrossed, was presented to the
society, and the Institution received a copy of the commemorative
medal struck in honor of the occasion.

Aberdeen University.—In response to an invitation to participate
in the ceremonies attending the four hundredth anniversary of the
founding of the University of Aberdeen, to take place in September,
1906, Prof. Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, honorary curator of the
division of minerals in the National Museum, has been appointed
to represent the Institution on that occasion.
26 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY,

MISCELLANEOUS.

National Academy of Sciences—In accordance with the custom
of many years the National Academy of Sciences was granted the
use of the lecture hall in the National Museum for its annual meet-
ing from April 16 to 18, 1906.

California Academy of Sciences——The Institution has assisted the
California Academy of Sciences in rehabilitating its hbrary, which
was entirely destroyed by the earthquake and fire at San Francisco
in April, 1906, by duplicating, as far as possible, the sets of the
Smithsonian publications and by soliciting and forwarding to the
academy the published works of learned institutions in this country
and abroad.

Fire protection of buildings—During the fiscal year a committee
was appointed to examine the buildings of the Institution and the
Museum and to suggest regulations for their further safeguard
against danger from fire. The report of this committee contained
valuable recommendations, which have been put into effect.

International Bureau of Ethnography.—At the Congress on the
Economic Expansion of the World, held at Mons, Belgium, in Sep-
tember, 1905,a number of recommendations were formulated, includ-
ing one for the organization by the Belgian Government of an inter-
national bureau of ethnography, whose purposes were stated to be>

1. The framing of ethnographical and sociological interrogatories.

2. The transmission of these interrogatories through the proper
authorities to colonial officers, explorers, ete.

3. The publication of the answers to such interrogatories.

4. The distribution of these answers, and cooperation in the
investigations.

The Smithsonian Institution was invited to cooperate in the
organization and promotion of the objects of this bureau, but after
careful consideration it was found that most of the objects to be
secured thereby were already included within the scope of the pres-
ent activities of the Institution and its bureaus, particularly in the
National Museum, where all collections belenging to the United
States are deposited, and in the Bureau of American Ethnology,
which is engaged upon investigations of the primitive peoples of
this country. The National Museum is at all times prepared, so
far as its collections allow, to enter into exchange relations with
the museums of other countries, and this part of the proposed
scheme could be carried on among the various countries that are
interested without the establishment of a new bureau.

It was found, moreover, that a very considerable sl] are of the
general expense incident to the proposed international bureau would

entail upon the United States without the possibility of a commen-
surate return. Since it is enabled by its present system to infor-
mally obtain most of the international advantages which would be
obtained through the proposed organization, the Institution, while
acceding in principle to the project, nevertheless felt obliged to
decline an active participation therein.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART.

The curatorship of the art collections of the nation was confided
to the Smithsonian Institution by the Congressional act of 1846,
providing for its establishment, in terms as follows:

Whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their
reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and ali
objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens
belonging to the United States * * * shall be delivered to such persons
as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive them, and shall
be so arranged and classified in the building erected for the Institution as
best to facilitate the examination and study of them.

During its early years this object was promoted in various ways:
Rooms for the gallery of art were especially designed in the Smith-
sonian building, a very valuable collection of prints and engravings
assembled by the Hon. George P. Marsh was purchased, a selection
of casts was secured abroad, and loan collections of paintings and
sculpture were placed upon exhibition. In 1866 the prints were
placed for temporary safe-keeping in the Library of Congress, and
in 1874, and again in 1879, various art objects belonging to the
Institution were deposited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art, which
had been established a few years before. With the definite organi-
' gation of the National Museum, art collections of various classes
were secured, notably in the graphic arts, ceramics, metal, lacquer
work, ivories, etc.

Suitable fireproof quarters for the collections belonging to the
Institution were subsequently provided under a special appropria-
tion by Congress, but their recall was deferred until 1896, when
formal action in the matter was taken by the Board of Regents.
Some of the prints, however, are still at the Library of Congress,
and a few other works of art, notably a large painting by Healy,
at the Corcoran Gallery.

While the title “ Gallery of Art” may have seemed presumptuous
for this small though relatively valuable collection, recent events
have justified the expectation that sooner or later the nation was
certain to possess such a gallery of genuine merit. Two benefactions
are to be recorded in the history of the past year, both so far
exceeding any previous ones as to mark a distinctively new era
28 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY,

in the building up of the National Gallery of Art. One of these
was a gift from Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, Michigan; the
other a bequest from the late Harriet Lane Johnston, of Washington.

THE ART COLLECTIONS OF CHARLES L. FREER.

Under date of January 3, 1905, Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit,
Michigan, transmitted to the Institution an offer to bequeath or make
present conveyance of title to his valuable private art collections to
the Smithsonian Institution or the Government, under certain condi-
tions, proposing at the same time to provide for the construction,
after his death, of a building of appropriate design and proportion
to receive the collections, provided that the Institution or the Govern-
ment would undertake its maintenance. Consideration was given to
this proposal by the Board of Regents at several meetings, and on
January 24, 1906, the offer was accepted on terms slightly modified
by Mr. Freer, as conveyed in a letter addressed to the President of
the United States, as follows:

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 15, 1905.
To the PRESIDENT:

Permit me to repeat my offer to bequeath my art collections to the Smith-
sonian Institution or to the United States Government, and also the sum of
$500,000 in money for the purpose of constructing a suitable building in which
to house them, upon the following terms and conditions:

First. The sum of $500,000 shall be paid by my executors to the Regents of
the Smithsonian Institution or the United States Government promptly after
my decease, and shall be used forthwith for the construction of a fireproof
building connected with the National Museum, the construction of which
has been recently authorized, or reasonably near thereto. :

Second. The interior of this building shall be arranged with special regard
for the convenience of students and others desirous of an opportunity for unin-
terrupted study. A suitable space shall be provided in which the Peacock
Room should be re-erected complete. The whole interior arrangement of the
building shall be agreed upon between the Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and myself within a reasonable time after the acceptance of this offer.

Third. The collections, with such additions thereto as shall be made during
my lifetime, shall be delivered by my executors to the Regents immediately
after the building is constructed and ready to receive them.

Fourth. The collections and the buildings shall be cared for and maintained
perpetually by the Smithsonian Institution or the United States Government at
its own expense.

Fifth. No addition or deduction shall be made to the collections after my
death, and nothing else shall ever be exhibited with them, or in the same
building, nor shall the said collections, or any part thereof, be removed at any
time from the said building except when necessary for the purpose of making
repairs or renovations in the building.

Sixth. No charge shall ever be made for admission to the building or for
the privilege of examining or studying the collections.

Seventh. The collections and building shall always bear my name in some
modest and appropriate form,
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 29

In lieu of the foregoing offer, I am willing, upon the conditions above
expressed, to make a present conveyance of the title to said collections to the
Institution or the Government, and a bequest of the sum of $500,000 for the
building, provided:

1. The collections shall remain in my possession during my life, and in the
possession of my executors after my death until the completion of the building.

2. I shall have the right to make such additions to the collections as may
seem to me advisable or necessary for the improvement of the collections, or
any of them.

3. On or before April next I will file with the efficials of the Smithsonian
Institution or the United States Government a descriptive inventory of the
objects belonging to the collections.

4. Both I and my executors shall be free from any liability on account of
any less in or danger that may accrue to the collections while in my or their
charge, even though such loss or injury shall occur by reason of my or their
negligence, or the negligence of my or their servants. agents or employees.

The exact form of the bequest or gift, and the details for carrying it into
execution, are legal questions that can be agreed upon by counsel representing
the Institution or the Government and myself.

I am, with great respect, very sincerely yours,
. CHARLES L. FREER.

Following is the resolution of acceptance, adopted by the Board
on January 24, 1906:

The Board of Regents, recognizing the great value to the people of the
United States of the art collection so generously offered by Mr. Charles L.
Freer, of Detroit, Michigan ;

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution do hereby
accept the tender of Mr. Freer to make present conveyance to the Institu-
tion of the title to his art collection, and to bequeath to the Institution
the sam of -$500,000 for the construction of a fireproof building in which to
house it, under the terms as stated in his communication to the President of
the United States dated December 15. 1905.

The conveyance was finally executed on May 5, 1906, in the follow-
ing terms:

Know all men by these presents that Charles L. Freer, of the city of Detroit,
county of Wayne, and State of Michigan, party of the first part, for and in
consideration of the sum of one dollar and of other valuable considerations to
him in hand paid by the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment created by
act of Congress, party of the second part, the receipt whereof is acknowledged,
has bargained and sold, and by these presents does grant and convey unto the
said party of the second part, and unto its successors, the art objects belonging
to said party of the first part and now in his possession at No. 33 Ferry avenue
east, in the city of Detroit, Michigan, particularly enumerated in the printed
inventory hereto attached and made a part hereof; to have and to hold the same
woto the said party of the second part, and its successors forever.

The said party of the first part for himself, his heirs, executors and adminis-
trators, does covenant and agree to and with the said party of the second part,
and its successors, to warrant and defend the sale hereby made of said property,
goods and chattels unto the said party of the second part, and its successors,

and dry points, 165 lithographs, and all the decorations of the famous
Peacock room. By the American artists, Dwight W. Tryon, Thomas
W. Dewing, and Abbott H. Thayer, 60 paintings in oil, water color,
and pastel. Of oriental paintings, 298 kakemono and makimono,
121 screens and 53 panels, by various masters of Japanese and Chinese
schools, from the tenth to the nineteenth century, including Ririomin.
Sesshu, Sesson, Motonobu, Tanyu, Koyetsu, Sotatsu, Korin, Kenzan,
Hoitsu, Okio, and Hokusai; besides 4 albums of Japanese art and 13
Tibetan paintings. Of oriental pottery, 953 pieces from Japan,
China, Korea, Central Asia, Persia, and Arabia. There is also a
small collection of ancient Chinese and Japanese bronzes and some
lacquer work by Koyetsu, Korin, and Ritsuwo.

THE ART COLLECTION OF HARRIET LANE JOHNSTON.

Mrs. Harriet Lane Johnston, the niece of James Buchanan, who
had accompanied him when minister abroad and who was mistress
of the White House during his term as President, had assembled at
her home in Washington some important works of art, including a
32 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY,

number of paintings by distinguished masters, and numerous articles
of historical interest and value. Upon her decease on July 3, 1903,
it was found that she had bequeathed this entire collection to the
Corcoran Gallery of Art under certain specified conditions and sub-
ject to the provision “ that in the event that the Government of the
United States shall establish in the city of Washington a national
art gallery that the said articles shall, upon the establishment of said
national art gallery, be, by the said trustees of the Corcoran Gallery
of Art and their successors, delivered to the said national art gal-
lery, and upon such delivery shall become the absolute property of
the said national art gallery established by the United States.”

The conditions were of such a character as to cause the Corcoran
Gallery to decline the bequest. From what has subsequently been
learned Mrs. Johnston seems not to have been aware that the Smith-
sonian Institution had been named as the depository for the objects
of art belonging to the nation, possibly from the fact that it had
never been formally designated as the National Gallery of Art.

The executors of the will, although desiring to carry out its intent
and render possible the maintenance of the collection in its integrity
in Washington, felt themselves without authority to award it to the
Smithsonian Institution under the circumstances, and the Congress
then in session (1903-4) was too near its close to secure what was
then deemed necessary legislation, although an appropriate resolu-
tion was introduced in the Senate.

The annual message of President Roosevelt to the Fifty-eighth Con-
gress, third session (dated December 6, 1904), contains the following
clause:

The collections of art contemplated in section 5586 of the Revised Statutes
should be designated and established as a national gallery of art, and the Smith-

sonian Institution should be authorized to accept any additions to said collection
that may be received by gift, bequest, or devise.

No action followed in Congress, but the executors of the Johnston
estate still feeling it incumbent upon them to prevent the disposal
of the collection by sale, filed a suit on February 7, 1905, in the su-
preme court of the District of Columbia, asking a construction of
certain doubtful clauses in the testament. By direction of the
President, the Attorney-General, on behalf of the United States, on
February 10, 1905, entered its appearance in the suit, claiming an
interest in the matter.

It is understood that all the legatees under the will agreed to the con-
tention of the Government except the Harriet Lane Home, of Balti-
more, founded by Mrs. Johnston, which had an interest in the
residuary estate, and which, from a sense of obligation to a public
charity, deemed a judicial decision necessary, although some of the
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 83

trustees of the Home were in favor of having the objects kept to-
gether as a perpetual memorial to their deceased relative and friend.
On October 23, 1905, the Government filed its full answer to the bill
of the Harriet Lane Home and its further petition that the United
States be declared to have established a National Art Gallery at and
in connection with the Smithsonian Institution. Testimony was sub-
mitted on the part of the Institution before an examiner on June 8,
1906. The decision was favorable to the Institution, and the decree of
the court is of exceptional importance, since it definitely establishes
the fact that the collection of art contemplated in the fundamental
act is the National Gallery of Art within the meaning and intent of
the law.
The full text of the decree is as follows:

This cause coming on for hearing In respect to the subject matters set forth
in the Thirteenth Paragraph of the Bill of Complaint; the allegations of the said
paragraph, the Answers thereto of the several Defendants, the provisions of the
Last Will and Testament and of the several codicils thereto of the Testatrix,
Harriet Lane Johnston, and the testimony taken on behalf of the United States
of America in support of its answer to the allegations of the said thirteenth
paragraph of the Bill of Complaint, having been by the Court, (after argument
of counsel for the United States of America and for the Defendant the Harriet
Lane Home for Invalid Children of Baltimore City, the residuary legatee and
devisee named in the said Last Will and Testament of the said Testatrix) fully
considered,

It is, therefore, on this eleventh day of July, in the year 1906, by the
Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, sitting in Equity, and by the
authority thereof, adjudged, ordered and decreed,

That there has been established by the United States of America in the City
of Washington a National Art Gallery, within the scope and meaning of that
part of the codicil bearing date April 21, 1902, made by the said Harriet Lane
Johnston to her Last Will and Testament, in the proceedings in this case men-
tioned, wherein she gave and bequeathed the pictures, miniatures and other
articles, to the Trustees of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and in the event of
the Government establishing in the City of Washington a National Art Gallery,
then that the said pictures and other articles above mentioned should be de-
jivered to the said National Art Gallery and become its property; and that the
said National Art Gallery is the National Art Gallery established by the United
States of America at, and in connection with, the Smithsonian Institution located
in the District of Columbia and described in the Act of Congress entitled an Act
to establish the “ Smithsonian Institution” for the Increase and Diffusion of

34 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

Knowledge among men, approved August 10, 1846, 9 Stat. L. 103, (Title LX XIII,
Section 5579 R. S. U. S.) and the subsequent Acts of Congress amendatory
thereof; and it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the United States
of America is entitled to demand and receive from the surviving Executors of
the said Harriet Lane Johnston, the Complainants named in the Bill of Com-
plaint in this case, all of the above mentioned pictures, articles of sculpture,
engravings, miniatures and other articles, the same to be and become a part
of the said National Art Gallery so established by the United States of America
at, and in connection with, the said Smithsonian Institution.

And whereas, the said Testatrix, Harriet Lane Johnston, in bequeath-
ing the said pictures and other articles to the Trustees of the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, in and by the codicil hereinbefore mentioned to her said
Will, made it a condition of the said bequest that the said articles should
be kept together in a room provided for the purpose, and to be designated
as the ‘ Harriet Lane Johnston Collection;’ and whereas it is apparent
that it was the design of the said Testatrix if the said pictures and other
articles bequeathed in connection with the same should belong to, and become
a part of the National Art Gallery established in the City of Washington
by the United States of America, that the above mentioned provision for
the keeping together in a room all of the said articles so bequeathed, and
that the same should be designated as the “ Harriet Lane Johnston Collec-
tion” (prescribed as the condition upon which the same should become the
property of the Trustees of the Corcoran Gallery of Art) should be the
condition upon which they should become part of the National Art Gallery
established by the United States of America,

Now therefore, it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed, as a condition
upon which the title of the United States of America shall be acquired in the
said pictures and other articles hereinbefore mentioned, that the same shall
all be kept, so as to form one distinct collection, in one hall or room in
one of the buildings of the Smithsonian Institution, the several classes of
the said articles being arranged and located in said hall or room according
to the best judgment of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; and
that in an appropriate, prominent and permanent way, the said Collection
shall be designated and declared to be the “ Harriet Lane Johnston Collection.”

And it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the costs of the pro-
ceedings in this case in connection with this decree shall be paid by the com-
plainants as Hxecutors of Harriet Lane Johnston, deceased.

WENDELL P. SrarrorD, Justice.

As a result of this decree the Harriet Lane Johnston collection was
delivered to the Institution on August 3, 1906. It consists of 31
pieces and comprises, besides works of art, several interesting histor-
ical objects. Among the paintings are a number by well-known
masters, whose productions are now difficult if not impossible to
obtain. The list is as follows: Painting, Madonna and Child, by
Bernardino Luini; painting, Madonna and Child, after Correggio;
portrait of Lady Essex as Juliet, by Sir Thomas Lawrence; portrait
of Miss Kirkpatrick, by George Romney; portrait of Mrs. Abington,
by John Hoppner; portrait of Mrs. Hammond, by Sir Joshua

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The National Museum is carrying on its operations as effectively as
possible, though two obstacles have for many years stood in the way
of perfecting its condition—lack of space and an insufficient staff.
The first of these will soon be removed, and it is hoped that action
on the other will not long be delayed.

The granite structure now being erected will be monumental in
character and cover a larger area than any other Government build-
ing in the city except the Capitol. Its four stories will contain
nearly 10 acres of floor space, which has been laid out to meet the
several requirements of exhibition, storage, and workrooms. Two
years have elapsed since the ground was broken, and in view of cer-
tain unavoidable delays another like period will probably be con-
sumed in its completion, but this length of time can not be regarded
as excessive, considering the massive character of the building and
86 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

the superior quality of the materials and workmanship which enter
into its construction.

The rapid growth of the national collections is only what was to be
expected in a country so extensive and of such exceeding wealth of
resources in its natural products, in its aborigines, and in the activi-
ties of its civilization. The illustration of all of these fields was
contemplated in the original plan of organization, and contributions
relating to them all have been pouring in for more than fifty years.

The Museum has never had an adequate amount of space at any
period in its history, not even when it began to occupy its present
brick building, since collections of sufficient extent to fill it were
already on hand. The accumulation of material has gone on still
more rapidly in recent years, taxing to the utmost the energies of the
small staff to Insure its preservation. The public halls are conse-
quently more utilized for storage than for exhibition, and visitors
find it difficult to circulate among the cases. The laboratories offer
scant space for the examination of specimens, and several rented
buildings are completely filled with collections of great value.

The acquisitions of the past year have amounted to over a quarter
of a million specimens, pertaining to practically all of the subjects
comprised in the museum classification. They were derived from a
great variety of sources and largely by transfer from the Govern-
ment surveys. The number of private donations and exchanges was
very large, and one of the former was of unusual extent and value.
It consisted of a collection of 75,000 specimens of Lepidoptera from
North and South America, including many types and rare species,
assembled by Mr. William Schaus and by him generously presented
to the National Museum.

In connection with the work of classifying the collections the
assistants and collaborators have made many important contribu-
tions to science, and the several publications of the year in which
these were printed are fully up to the standard so long maintained.
Irom the duplicates recently separated from the reserve collections
nearly 20,000 specimens, made up into about 260 sets, were distributed
to schools and colleges in the interest of education.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The field investigations by the Bureau of American Ethnology
related to the Indians of Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Indian
Territory, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Florida, but were not as
extensive as usual because of the amount of work required to be done
at the office in Washington. The preparation of manuscript and
reading of proafs for the Handbook of the Indians occupied the
attention of most of the members of the staff and of several experts
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 37

connected with other establishments for shorter or longer periods
throughout the year. This large work, which has often been referred
to in past reports, will be practically a résumé of all that is known
regarding the aborigines of the United States, based upon informa-
tion from every possible source, including the unpublished records of
the Bureau.

The matter is arranged alphabetically for convenience of refer-
ence, and the two octavo volumes of which it will consist will be pro-
fusely illustrated. From the point of view of general interest it
will be the most important publication which the Bureau has issued.
The correcting of the proofs of the first volume was nearing comple-
tion at the close of the year.

Considerable progress was also made on the Handbook of Indian
Languages, the main part of which will consist of sketches of sixteen
American languages, and reports and bulletins relating to a num-
ber of other subjects were completed or in course of preparation.

With a view to assisting the Departments of the Government hav-
ing custody of the public domain in the preservation of American
antiquities, under the provisions of the act of Congress approved
June 8, 1906, the Bureau has been active in compiling a card cata-
logue of archeological sites, especially the ruined pueblos and cliff
dwellings, and has made good progress in the preparation of a series
of bulletins giving information concerning these antiquities.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service, initiated by the Smithsonian
Institution in the early years of its existence, for the interchange
of scientific publications between learned societies and individuals
in the United States and those of foreign countries, and later desig-
nated by the United States Government as the agency for the
transmission of sets of official documents to selected depositories
throughout the world, has effectually discharged the commissions
intrusted to it. Of the maximum hmit of 100 copies of all Gov-
ernment publications, authorized by law to be distributed under
the direction of the Library of Congress, from time to time, to
important governmental libraries in European and other countries,
80 complete or partial sets have now been assigned and are being
transmitted by the exchange service to their respective destinations.
Additional public documents, issued from month to month, are
forwarded promply to the various depositories.

The Institution has continued its endeavor, through the proper
channels, to secure the fullest cooperation on the part of all civilized
governments in reciprocally receiving and distributing within their
38 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

own borders transmissions from the United States and in dispatch-
ing to this country similar sendings from its own scientific and
educational institutions and citizens. Some important changes in
connection with the details of this service have been made during
the year, which have resulted in greater dispatch and efficiency.

Steps have recently been taken through which it is hoped that the
British Government may establish a bureau of its own, thus relieving
the Smithsonian Institution from maintaining a special agency in
London for the receipt and distribution of exchanges with Great
Britain.

It is gratifying to state that through the efforts of the Hon. W. W.
Rockhill, American minister at Peking, the long-pending exchange
negotiations with China have been brought to a successful conclu-
sion, the Shanghai bureau of foreign affairs having been designated
as the representative of the Chinese Government in this matter.
Efforts are being made to resume exchange relations with Korea, the
transmissions to that country having been carried on heretofore
through the courtesy of the Russian commission of international
exchanges at St. Petersburg,

Through the offices of the Department of State and of the Ameri-
can minister at Rome, the exchange service between Italy and the
United States has been placed upon a more efficient basis. The
government of Lourenco Marquez has been added to the countries to
receive full sets of official documents, in exchange for which the
authorities of Portuguese East Africa are to send to the United
States not only the publications of Lourenco Marquez, but also those
of the province of Mozambique and of different chartered companies.

The total weight of packages handled by the International
Exchanges for the year was 471,559 pounds, and the number of cor-
respondents throughout the world has reached 56,414, an increase of
4,434 over the preceding year.

I record with regret the death on June 23, 1906, of Dr. Joseph
von K6résy, who had served as exchange agent of the Institution at
Budapest, Hungary, since 1897. He was the first agent of the In-
stitution for that country, and had taken special interest in the
work, materially increasing the number of packages received from
correspondents in Hungary. Mr. Julius Pikler was appointed, tem-
porarily, to succeed him.

Owing to the death of Dr. Paul Leverkiihn, director of the scien-
tific institutions and library of His Royal Highness the Prince of
Bulgaria, the transmission of exchanges to that country has been
temporarily suspended, but it is expected that it will soon be
resumed.
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 39

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

In administering the affairs of the National Zoological Park, the
purposes defined by Congress in the act of organization, namely,
the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of
the people, have been kept constantly in view, though on account
of insufficient funds it has been impossible to promote these aims
to the extent desired. It is hoped that this condition will be rec-
tified in the near future, but that the park is already an assured
success and that its objects are well appreciated is evidenced by
the large number of visitors, which, during the past year, exceeded
half a million.

Extreme care has been taken to preserve its very picturesque
natural features, and forming, as it does, an essential part of the
extensive parking system of the Rock Creek Valley, the mainte-
nance of its driveways and paths has been the subject of constant
attention.

The inadequacy of the appropriations for the proper equipment
of the park has made it necessary to exercise an unwise economy 1n
the construction of its buildings and other shelters, the majority
of which are of a cheap and temporary character, and sooner or later
must be replaced. The large building lately planned on a substan-
tial and permanent basis has now been in course of erection during
three years, since only small annual allotments could be assigned to
the purpose, and its completion must await the appropriation for
1907.

Among the pressing needs is a small building, with outlying yards,
which can be used as a hospital and quarantine for sick animals and
also serve as a pathological and anatomical laboratory, in partial
furtherance of the primary object of the park—the advancement of
science. It is hoped that funds can be spared to begin upon this
structure, the importance of which is very great, during the ensuing
year.

The economy of establishing a central heating plant has long been
recognized, but this feature has also been delayed for the reasons
' already stated. A beginning was made, however, during the past
year, the boilers being placed in an extension of the temporary work-
shop and connections made with the three nearest buildings.

Congress has recently authorized the construction of streets at
short distances from the western and southeastern boundaries of
the park, and it seems especially desirable that the intervening strips
of land be purchased for addition to the park. On one side the
projected street is close to the edge of a steep slope within the park,
40 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY,

while on the other the back yards of houses would extend to the
park fence. The streets in question would form more appropriate
boundaries than now exist in those directions, and the acquirement
of the land would help to preserve the natural beauties of the park.

The number of animals in the park at the close of the year was
1,272, of which 509 were mammals, 648 birds, and 130 reptiles.

It is gratifying to record the continued cooperation of the Depart-
ment of State, through its representatives abroad, in the acquisi-
tion by gift or exchange of a number of rare animals from various
parts of the world.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

This Observatory was established at the instance of the late Sec-
retary Langley, who acted as its Director, and was intended to
render possiblé the continuation of the epoch-making researches
which he initiated at Allegheny while in charge of the observatory
there. Mr. C. G. Abbot, his principal assistant for a number of
years, has been designated temporarily as acting director.

The buildings of the Observatory, though of a temporary char-
acter, have been kept in good repair, and the inclosure surrounding
them has been enlarged to meet additional requirements of space.
As a measure of protection, a small fireproof shelter has been
erected in the northeast corner of the inclosure to contain the storage
batteries and an alternating current generator and to serve as a
distributing center for the electrical currents used in the Observatory.
Continued attention has been given to the improvement of the ap-
paratus, with the object of adapting it more effectually to the
researches which are prosecuted and of increasing its delicacy and
precision.

The investigations of the Observatory have been conducted along
lines of definite research, and much important information relating
to solar radiation and to the transparency of the earth’s atmosphere
and the sun’s envelope has been collected. During the past year, as
for some time previously, the work has been steadily directed with
the aim of securing data in regard to the suspected variability of
the sun. As explained in the last report, arrangements were made
in the spring of 1905 to secure series of observations at a high alti-
tude under superior atmospheric conditions, the work being also
continued at Washington during the same period. This was rendered
possible through the courtesy of the Carnegie Institution and the
invitation of Prof. George E. Hale, director of its newly established
observatory for solar research on Mount Wilson, in southern Cali-
fornia.
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 41

The Smithsonian party, in charge of Mr. C. G. Abbot, and
equipped with the necessary apparatus, reached Mount Wilson in
May and remained there until the latter part of October, 1905. The
weather conditions remained excellent throughout most of the season,
permitting the work to go on uninterruptedly. Again, in May, 1906,
Mr. Abbot returned to Mount Wilson, where his observations are
expected to continue over a somewhat longer period.

Sufficient material has been assembled since the publication of the
first volume of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory to war-
rant the issuing of a second volume, the preparation of which is now
in progress.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT:

Aprenpix I.

REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The subject of greatest interest continues to be the construction of the new
Museum building, for which the ground was broken in June, 1904. The failure
of certain of the quarries to supply granite as rapidly as was expected has
caused delay in the erection of the outer walls, but otherwise good progress
has been made, and at the close of the year the basement walls, as well as the
heavy steel framework and brick arches for the main floor, were approaching
completion.

Until the new building is ready for occupancy the national collections must
continue to become more crowded each year, but the interval is now too short
to occasion much concern regarding their safety. The staff could, however, be
increased to some extent with great advantage at this time, especially in view
of the many preparations essential to the transfer of collections, and the impor-
tance of placing the salaries of employees on the same basis as in the Executive
Departments can not be too strongly emphasized.

The roofs on the present Museum building remain in as serious a condition
as ever, notwithstanding the extensive repairs made and the constant oversight
to which they have been subjected. Every expedient thus far applied has
failed to accomplish its purpose, and in all heavy rains the leaks still prevail to
an alarming degree. Driven thus to drastic measures plans were drawn up
and partial contracts entered upon before the close of the year, whereby all the
present main roofs will be removed and replaced by metal roofs of the best
quality, without the necessity of greatly disturbing the contents of the exhibi-
tion halls below. Under the current rate of appropriation for building repairs
the work will have to be extended over two or three years, but in the end the
covering of the building will be in even better condition than when it was
first put on.

While the building is constructed entirely of fireproof materials, yet its con-
tents, now much crowded, are to a large extent combustible. The dividing walls
between the different halls, courts, and ranges are, moreover, pierced with
large openings reaching nearly to the roof, which makes of the building practi-
cally one large room over 2 acres in extent. Although every known precaution
for the detection and extinguishing of a fire has been introduced, still it has
been deemed prudent to isolate the several halls by filling in the openings with
fireproof material, and some progress in this direction had been made before
the end of the year.

With such exceptions as have been mentioned the Museum was never in so
good a condition as it is to-day. Improvements are to be noted in the exhibition
halls, in the reserve storage, and in the laboratories and offices. It is the
overcrowding and the necessity of trusting to outside storage for the keeping of
valuable collections which now gives the most concern.

44 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

ACCESSIONS.

The number of specimens added to the collections was over a quarter of a
million, divided among subjects under the three departments of the Museum
about as follows: Anthropology, 8,000; biology, 227,000; geology, 21,000.

The most valuable single contribution, and one of the largest ever received
by the Department of Biology, was the gift from Mr. William Schaus of his
collection of North and South American lepidoptera, containing 73,000 specimens
and a very large number of types and rare species. Dr. W. L. Abbott, who is
still continuing his systematic investigations in the Malaysian region, presented,
as usual, the entire results of his year’s field work, comprising a very large
amount of important material chiefly from HWngano and Nias islands, West
Borneo, and western Sumatra. The subjects mainly represented are ethnology,
physical anthropology, mammals, and other vertebrate animals. From little-
known localities in the southwestern part of the United States, especially the
Territories of Arizona and New Mexico, colections in ethnology and archeology
to the extent of several thousand specimens were obtained through explora-
tions by Dr. Walter Hough, of the Museum staff, in conjunction with Mr. P. G.
Gates, of Pasadena, California, and by members of the Bureau of American Hth-
nology. Many additions were made to the Philippine collection of ethnology
secured at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and important specimens in
archeology were received from Japan, France, Algeria, South America, and
Mexico.

The Museum has been for some time assembling a comprehensive collection
of small arms, with the aid and cooperation of the Departments of War and
of the Navy. Appreciating the interest taken here in this subject, the
United States Cartridge Company, of Lowell, Massachusetts, has most gener-
ously deposited its splendid series of 569 pieces, the finest and most complete
collection of its kind in the United States. Beginning with the common
bow and crossbow, all typical features in the mechanical development of
devices for throwing projectiles are represented, down to the most perfect
gun and pistol of modern times. The display cases in which these implements
are shown, 38 in number, were supplied by the company, and are excellently
well adapted for the purpose. To the collection of aeroplanes have been
added originals of the Lilienthal and Hargrave flying machines, and several
models used by Mr. Octave Chanute in his experiments on this subject.

The collection of glassware has been greatly enriched by a gift from the
Libby Glass Company of many pieces and tools illustrating the entire process
of making cut glass, from the raw material to the finished article, the latter
comprising exquisite examples of their workmanship. In pottery, also, many
fine pieces of domestic manufacture and decoration were obtained through
the members of the American Potters’ Association.

An especially notable addition to the division of historic religions is a
Tibetan manuscript, presented by the British Indian government. It is a
treatise on Tibetan Buddhistic theology or metaphysics, written in gold
characters on the black ground of 366 cardboards between covers of lacquered
wood. The acquisitions in history have been numerous and important, and
some of great intrinsic value. They illustrate many interesting subjects
both of warfare and of domestic life.

A finely executed bust of the late Walter Reed, major and surgeon, United
States Army, and chief of the Government commission which determined
the relations of the mosquito to the transmission of yellow fever, has been
deposited by the Walter Reed Memorial Association, and given a conspicuous
place in the main Museum hall.
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 45

An exceptionally large quantity of fishes and marine invertebrates, chiefly
representing explorations at the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippine Islands,
and Japan, and on the northwest coast of America, were received from the
United States Bureau of Fisheries. Much of the material was still unstudied,
but among the fishes were the types of 148 recently described species. Mr.
Robert Ridgway, who spent part of the year in Costa Rica, returned with
over 1,800 specimens of interesting birds, of which more than one-third was
donated by the National Museum of that country. Specimens of the same
group from the Philippines and Guam were presented by Dr. E. A. Mearns.

Important collections of reptiles and batrachians were received from Japan
and the Philippines; of fishes from Mexico, through the Field Museum of Nat-
ural History; of marine invertebrates from Hawaii, Japan, Burma, South
Africa, and South America, and of insects from Texas, Central America,
Guatemala, the West Indies, and Japan, chiefly through the Department of Agri-
culture. Dr. J. N. Rose brought back from his explorations in Mexico a large
collection of plants, especially rich in cacti, and many specimens from different
parts of the United States were transmitted by the Department of Agriculture.

The Department of Geology was chiefly enriched through transfers from the
United States Geological Survey, of specimens of rocks, minerals, and fossils.
The rocks illustrated detailed surveys in several regions. The fossils included
many described species and figured specimens from the Miocene, Upper Cre-
taceous, Ordovician, Devonian, and Silurian. Especially noteworthy were sey-
eral thousand Mesozoic plants, which had been worked up and described by
Ward, Fontaine, Bibben, and Wieland. Two thousand Russian Ordovician
bryoza were received as a gift from Dr. A. von Mickwitz, of St. Petersburg, and
several hundred examples of fossil woods and plants from the Permo-Carbon-
iferous of Sao Paulo and Santa Catharina, Brazil, were presented by Mr. I. C.
White.

EXPLORATIONS,

The Museum depends chiefly for its scientific collections upon the explorations
of the various Government bureaus and of private individuals, having scant
means to expend in this direction. The principal field work by members of the
Museum staff was conducted by Doctor Hough in Arizona and New Mexico,
Doctor Hrdli¢ka in Florida, Mr. Ridgway in Costa Rica, Doctor True in Mary-
land, Doctor Rose in Mexico, and Doctor Bassler in the southern Appalachians,
Virginia, and the Mississippi Valley.

CARE AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The first duty devolving upon the Museum staff is the care and preservation
of the collections, all of which has been conscientiously performed and with as
satisfactory results as is possible in the present crowded condition of the rooms.
In fact, much improvement is to be noted for the year in the closer segregation
of some parts of the reserve series, but with the effect of changing the Museum
halls more and more into the condition of storerooms.

Notable progress has been made in the classification of collections, their
labeling, cataloguing, and scientific arrangement, resulting in many important
contributions to knowledge. The preparation by members of the Museum staff
of articles for the Handbook of the Indians, soon to be issued by the Bureau
of American Ethnology, necessitated extensive investigations based upon the
collections in anthropology, and much was accomplished toward working up
the rich ethnological material recently acquired from Malaysia, Arizona, and
New Mexico.
46 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

In zoology the mammals sent from Malaysia by Doctor Abbott were the sub-
ject of much attention, the manuscript for the fourth volume of Ridgway’s
Birds of North and Middle America was brought nearly to completion, and
a large work on the herpetology of Japan was finished. Extensive studies
were made on the large collections of fishes from Japan, the Philippine Islands,
the Amazon River, and the deeper waters of the Pacific Ocean. Contributions
were prepared on several families and faunal collections of mollusks, on the
bigher crustacea from Hawaii, the fresh-water crabs from different parts of
the world, the isopod crustaceans of the North American coasts, and the corals
from several localities. The soundings made by the U. 8S. 8. Nero in the course
of its cable surveys in the Pacific Ocean were the subject of a careful study and
an instructive report. The researches completed in the division of insects are
represented by 383 separate papers.

The investigations in geology have related mainly to the description of
meteorites and of their structure and composition. Several important contribu-
tions in paleontology on both vertebrates and invertebrates were submitted.

EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

The entire renovation and rearrangement of the collections of prehistoric
archeology, with some additions, have made it possible to reopen the large
upper hall in the Smithsonian building long devoted to this subject. The trans-
fer to storage of some of the older collections in the Museum building has
afforded the opportunity of presenting to the public some of the more recent
nnd interesting acquisitions in ethnology. Otherwise but few changes were
made in the exhibition collections beyond providing for the larger and more
important exhibits returned from the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and
Clark expositions.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Of duplicate specimens recently separated from the reserve collections,
over 19,000 were distributed in 261 sets to educational establishments, and
17,500 were used in exchanges, from which valuable returns have been
received. The number of specimens sent to specialists for study, to be
returned again to the Museum, was nearly 20,000.

The publications issued during the year comprised the annual report of
the Museum for 1904; volumes 28, 29, and 30 of the Proceedings, the first
mentioned having been nearly completed the previous year; bulletins num-
bered 54 and 55, the former on the isopod crustaceans of North America, the
latter on the oceanography of the Pacific Ocean; and part 1 of Volume X of
the Contributions from the National Herbarium. The number of publica-
tions distributed, including full volumes and separate papers, was approxi-
mately 103,000.

The library of the Museum received 3.556 books and 5,482 pamphlets and
periodicals, increasing the total contents of the library to 27,726 volumes and
44,075 unbound papers.

At the Lewis and Clark Exposition, in which the Institution and its several
bureaus participated, the Museum collection consisted almost entirely of
objects selected from the exhibits at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, only
a few additions being made thereto.

Assistant Secretary in charge of National Museum.
APPENDIX II.
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the operations of
the Bureau of American Ethnology for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1906:

Researches among the Indian tribes were conducted in accordance with the
plan of operations approved by the Secretary June 5, 1905; these include
investigations among the aborigines of Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Indian
Territory, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Florida, and, more especially, re-
searches in the office of the Bureau and in various museums and libraries
throughout the country. The scientific staff remains the same as during the
previous year with the single exception that Mr. F. W. Hodge was transferred
from the Secretary’s office of the Smithsonian Institution to the Bureau, with
the title of ethnologist—a step which permits him to devote his entire time to
the completion of the Handbook of the Indians.

Aside from his administrative duties, the chief was occupied with the com-
pletion and revision of material for the Handbook of the Indians and in the
preparation of a monographic work on the technology and art of the tribes.
He also continued his duties as honorary curator of the division of prehistoric
archeology in the National Museum.

Mrs. M. C. Stevenson was engaged during the early months of the fiscal
year in reading the final proofs of her monograph on the Zuni Indians, which
issued from the press in December. In January she again entered the field,
having selected the pueblo of Taos, New Mexico, as a suitable place for the
continuation of her researches. In initiating her work in this pueblo Mrs.
Stevenson encountered many difficulties and her progress was at first slow;
but later, owing largely to the very courteous cooperation of the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, her study of the history, language, and customs of the tribe
was facilitated, and was progressing favorably at the close of the year.

During the early part of the year Mr. James Mooney was chiefly occupied,
in collaboration with other members of the Bureau, with the Handbook of the
Indians, which work was continued at intervals after he took the field. On
September 19, 1905, he left Washington for western Oklahoma to continue
researches among the Kiowa, Southern Cheyenne, and allied tribes, partly in
fulfillment of the joint arrangement between the Bureau and the Field Museum
of Natural History. His stay while with the Kiowa was chiefly at the agency
at Anadarko, Oklahoma. Among the Cheyenne he made headquarters at Can-
tonment, Oklahoma, the central settlement of the most conservative element of
the tribe. Mr. Mooney returned to Washington about the end of April, and
resumed work on his report, giving much attention also to the Handbook of the
Indians.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes completed during the year his report on the aborigines
of Porto Rico and neighboring islands. He also prepared an account of his
researches in eastern Mexico during the winter of 1905-6, conducted under
a grant from the funds of the Smithsonian Institution and an allotment from

47
48 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

the Bureau appropriation. These papers were assigned to the Twenty-fifth
Annual Report and were in type at the close of the year. Doctor Fewkes
likewise made considerable progress in the preparation of a bulletin on the
antiquities of the Little Colorado Valley, Arizona.

During the year Dr. John R. Swanton completed and prepared for the press
all of the Tlingit material, ethnological and mythological, collected by him
during previous years; and all ef the ethnological, as well as a portion of the
mythological material, has been accepted for introduction into the Twenty-
sixth Annual Report. Doctor Swanton also interested himself particularly
in the study of the linguistic stocks of Louisiana and southern Texas, many
of these languages being either on the verge of extinction or already extinct;
he also has in course of preparation a grammer and dictionary and an ethno-
logical sketch of the Natchez Indians, and has made the important discovery
that this people did not form a distinct linguistic stock, as has been supposed,
but formed a part of the great Muskhogean family.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged almost entirely in investigating and report-
ing on etymologies of terms and names, and in elaborating and preparing
important articles for the Handbook of the Indians, and also in reading proof
of that important work conjointly with the other collaborators.

During the year Dr. Cyrus Thomas was engaged almost continuously on the
Handbook of the Indians, assisting in final revision of the manuscript and in
reading proof. During the first two or three months he assisted also in
reading and correcting proofs of Bulletin 28, which treats of Mexican antiq-
ulties—a work for which his extensive researches regarding the glyphics of
middle America especially fitted him.

The manuscript of the body of ‘the Handbook of the Indians was trans-
mitted to the Public Printer early in July. In view of the fact that numerous
tribal and general articles were prepared by specialists not connected directly
with the Bureau, it was deemed advisable to submit complete galley proofs
of the Handbook to each as received. While this involved considerable delay
in the proof reading, the corrections and suggestions received showed the
wisdom of the plan. By the close of the year all the material was in type
through the letter N, and 544 pages of this, to the article ‘“ Heraldry,” had
been finally printed.

The work on the Handbook of Languages, in charge of Dr. Franz Boas,
honorary philologist of the Bureau, has been continued. The several sketches
of American languages—sixteen in number—which are to form the body of
this work are now practically complete with the exception of those on the
Eskimo and the Iroquois. Field work was conduted by Mr. Edward Sapir
among the Yakima of Oregon and by Mr. Frank J. Speck among the Yuchi in
Indian Territory.

Mr. Stewart Culin, curator of ethnology in the Brooklyn Institute Museum,
whose monograph on Indian Games forms the bulk of the Twenty-fourth
Annual Report, was engaged during the year in reading the proofs of that
volume; but his absence in the field for a protracted period prevented its com-
pletion.

The movement for the enactment by Congress of a law for the preservation of
American antiquities, which was inaugurated during previous years, was con-
tinued by various individuals and institutions, and the perfected measure
became a law in June. With the view of assisting the departments of the Goy-
ernment having charge of the public domain in the initiation of practical meas-
ures for the preservation of the antiquities of the Southwest, the Bureau has
actively continued the compilation of a card catalogue of the archeological
sites, especially the ruined pueblos and cliff dwellings, and during the year has
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 49

made much progress in the preparation of a series of bulletins to be devoted to
the fuller presentation of all that is known regarding these antiquities.

In promoting this work Mr. E. L. Hewett was commissioned to proceed to
New Mexico for the purpose of making a survey of the ancient remains of the
Jemez plateau region, a large part of which is now included in the Jemez
Forest Reserve. A preliminary report on this work was submitted immediately
on Mr. Hewett’s return to Washington, and later a paper was prepared in the
form of an illustrated descriptive catalogue of the antiquities, to be published
as Bulletin 32. In March Mr. Hewett was called on to represent the Bureau as
a member of the Interior Department survey of certain boundary linés in
southern Colorado, the principal object being to determine the relation of the
more important ruins of the Mesa Verde region to the boundaries of the pro-
posed Mesa Verde park, a measure for the establishment of which was pending
in Congress. Shortly after the receipt of Mr. Hewett’s report this measure
became a law. A leading object kept in view by Mr. Hewett on this expedition
was the collection of data for the compilation of a bulletin on the antiquities of
the Mesa Verde region for the Bureau’s bulletin series.

In February Dr. Ales Hrdli¢ka, of the National Museum, was commissioned
to proceed to Osprey, on Sarasota Bay, Florida, for the purpose of examining
several localities where fossil human bones, apparently indicating great age,
have been discovered. The evidence obtained appears adverse to the theory of
the great antiquity of the remains, but the observations made by Doctor
Hrdli¢ka and Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan, who accompanied him as a representa-
tive of the Geological Survey, on the unusual activity of fossilizing agencies in
the locality are of extreme interest.

Dr. Walter Hough, of the National Museum, who has taken a prominent part
in the investigation of the antiquities of the Southwest, has in preparation for
the Bureau series a bulletin on the antiquities of the upper Gila Valley.

During the year the following permits to conduct explorations on the public
lands and reservations of the Southwest were granted by the departments on
recommendation of the Bureau, transmitted through the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution :

(1) In September, 1905, the Southwest Society of the Archzeological Insti-
tute of America applied for permission to conduct archeological explorations
on Indian reservations and forest reserves in the Southwest, the work to begin
in the spring of 1906. Later, permission to make a preliminary reconnoissance
during the latter part of 1905 was asked. Recommended by the Bureau;
granted by the Office of Indian Affairs and the Forest Service.

(2) In January, 1906, the request of the Bureau of American Ethnology
for authority to prosecute ethnological researches in New Mexico, particularly
at Taos, was favorably acted upon by the Office of Indian Affairs.

(3) In April, 1906, the American Museum of Natural History, through Dr.
Clark Wissler, curator of anthropology in that institution, requested permis-
sion to conduct explorations on Indian reservations in southern California.
Recommended by the Bureau; granted by the Indian Office.

One application for a permit was denied, one was withdrawn, and one was
pending at the close of the year.

The collections of arcneological and ethnological specimens made during the
year are more limited than heretofore, owing to the reduced amount of field
work undertaken. The most important accession is the product of Mr. BE. L.
Hewett’s explerations among the ancient ruins of the Jemez plateau. Other
collections worthy of note are those made by Mr. Mooney in Oklahoma and
by Doctor Hrdlicka in Florida. All collections were transferred to the
National Museum in accordance with law.

sm 1906——4.
50 REPORT OF THE aCTING SECRETARY.

The study of the Indian delegations visiting Washington during the year was
continued as heretofore. One hundred and forty-two portrait negatives were
made and measurements and casts were obtained in a number of cases.

Mr. John P. Sanborn, jr., who was probationally appointed on April 6, 1905,
as editor and compiler, was permanently appointed October 6, but on October
19 he was, at his own request, indefinitely furloughed. On February 16, 1906,
Mr. Joseph G. Gurley was probationally appointed as editor through certifica-
tion by the Civil Service Commission. The Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth
Annual Reports and Bulletins 31 and 32 were read and prepared for the press,
and proof reading of the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth reports, and of Bul-
letins 30, 31, and 32 further occupied the attention of the editor, although Mr.
Hodge and the various collaborators on Bulletin 80 (the Handbook of the
indians) assumed the main burden of the reading of that work.

The illustrations work, including photography, continued in charge of Mr.
Delancey Gill, who was assisted, as heretofore, by Mr. H. Walther. The num-
ber of illustrations prepared for the reports was 852, and the whole number
transmitted to the printer was 1,023.

During the year the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Annual Reports were sub-
mitted to the Secretary and the Twenty-fifth was transmitted to the Public
Printer, the Twenty-sixth being retained in the Bureau pending the completion
of the two next preceding volumes. Bulletin 30, submitted at the beginning
of the year, is in press, and Bulletin 32 is in the bindery, while Bulletin 31
was transmitted to the printer toward the close of the year. The distribution
of publications was continued as in former years. Bulletin 28 was published
in October, and Bulletin 29 and the Twenty-third Annual Report in December.

The library remained in charge of Miss Ella Leary, who compieted the work
of accessioning and cataloguing the books, pamphlets, and periodicals up to
date. Owing to the crowded condition of the library, about 600 publications,
chiefly periodicals, received by gift or through exchange, but not pertaining to
the work of the Bureau, were transferred to the library of the National Mu-
seum. During the year there were received and recorded 306 volumes, 900
pamphlets, and the current issues of upward of 500 periodicals. One hundred
and fifty volumes were bound at the Government Printing Office. The library
now contains 12,858 bound volumes, 9,000 pamphiets, and a large number of
periodicals which relate to anthropology and kindred topics.

The clerical force of the Bureau consists of five regular employees: Mr. J. B.
Clayton, head clerk; Miss Bmilie R. Smedes and Miss May 8S. Clark, stenog-
raphers; Miss Ella Leary, clerk and acting librarian, and Mrs. Frances S.
Nichols, typewriter. During the year Mr. William I. Bartel, messenger, was
promoted to a clerkship and subsequently transferred to the Interstate Coin-
merce Commission.

The property of the Bureau is comprised in seven classes: Office furniture
and appliances; field outfits; linguistic and ethnological manuscripts and other
documents; photographs. drawings, paintings, and engravings; a working
library; collections held temporarily by collaborators for use in research, and
the undistributed residue of the editions of Bureau publications.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

Str: I have the honor to present herewith a report on the operations of the
International Exchanges during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1906.

In common with the parent Institution and all of its branches the Inter-
national Exchanges has suffered a great loss in the death of the Secretary,
Mr. S. P. Langley. In some other place, no doubt, a fitting tribute will be paid
to his memory, and his services to the Institution and to science will be ade-
quately depicted, but I can not refrain from recalling the fact here that Mr.
Langley’s connection with the Institution began in 1887 in the capacity of
assistant secretary in charge of exchanges, publications, and library.

During this period the operations of the exchanges have nearly trebled in the
quantity and in the breadth of distribution. Throughout his term of office as
Secretary Mr. Langley continued an active interest not only in the general
operations of the exchanges, but even in its details, and in his annual trips
abroad, made at his own expense, he invariably visited the agencies in the
countries to which he went, and in other ways promoted the interests of the
service. I have little hesitation in saying that Mr. Langley made the exchanges
one of the principal agencies for increasing the usefulness of the Institution
in foreign countries and for carrying out the intention of the founder in the
“ diffusion of knowledge.”

The work required of this branch of the Smithsonian Institution is essen-
tially of a business nature, though it should be added that through its opera-
tions one of the general purposes of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge
is greatly furthered. The duties of the Exchanges consist chiefly in transport-
ing packages of books from Washington to all foreign lands, however remote,
‘and in receiving publications from other countries for distribution throughout
the United States and territory subject to its jurisdiction.

The requirements of the service necessitate the handling of many packages
and a number of heavy boxes. As work of this nature could be conducted with
greater facility on the ground floor, five rooms in the southeast basement of the
Smithsonian building were remodeled in 1893 for the express use of the Inter-
national Exchanges. These rooms have been furnished with assorting tables,
bins, filing cases, and such other office appliances and supplies as are necessary
for the use of clerks and other assistants. The approximate value of this prop-
erty is about $2,300.

The property acquired during the year consisted principally of boxes, pack-
ing materials, stationery, and other necessary supplies, the cost of which
amounted to $3,054.84.

While it has been the practice to take an account of stock on hand at the
end of each fiscal year, no detailed statement of the disposition of supplies
has been kept in the Exchange Office, such supplies being given out as needed
by one of the clerks. There has recently been inaugurated a complete debit
and credit card system for keeping the property record, which will go into
effect at the beginning of the coming fiscal year. It will then be necessary

51

52 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

for employees in the Exchanges to present to the clerk in charge of property
approved requisitions for such stationery and supplies as they may require
in the discharge of their duties. A room has been specially fitted up with
shelves and bins for keeping the stock on hand.

On account of the possible danger from fire, extensive changes and improve-
ments are now being made in the electric wires which furnish light for the
exchange rooms, in accordance with the recommendations of a committee
appointed by yourself. This work was only begun in the latter part of June,
and is not yet finished.

It may be added here that, as a further precaution, all exchange packing
boxes have been removed from the halls of the Smithsonian building to a
warehouse outside of the Institution. There are, therefore, now kept on
hand here only a sufficient number of boxes for the immediate needs of the
service. Other precautions have been taken, such as the purchasing of new
hose and metallic receptacles for paper and other waste material.

So far as reported to the Institution, in only one instance during the past
year has a ease of exchanges gone astray. This case was addressed to the
La Plata Museum, and was shipped from New York in due course, but upon
arrival of the steamer at the port of Buenos Ayres it was missing from the
ship’s cargo. The forwarding agents in New York are now endeavoring to
trace this consignment.

While two shipments of international exchanges were subject to general
average charges, one consigned to Sweden and the other to South Australia,
the damage to the cargoes of the vessels did not extend to the exchange cases,
and they were forwarded without much delay to their destinations. The
general average amounts involved were small and the distributing agencies
were good enough to meet them.

During the past year a number of unclaimed packages of books from abroad,
addressed to certain Government offices and individuals in this country, were
sold at public auction at several of the United States custom-houses, more
especially at the port of entry at Georgetown. These packages were not
addressed to the Smithsonian Institution proper, but as some of them were
sent to the United States Government as exchanges, this Institution, so far as
possible, recovered the packages and forwarded them to their intended recip-
ients. In each instance the sender was fully written regarding the proper
manner of transmitting exchanges to this country. Had these consignments,
instead of being addressed directly to Washington, been sent through the regu-
lar exchange channels of the countries from which they emanated, there would
have been no difficulty in their prompt and safe arrival at their destinations.
Packages of exchanges which are forwarded through the authorized exchange
agencies are addressed to the Smithsonian Institution in care of the collector
of customs at the port of New York, where they are entered free of duty and
forwarded at once to the Institution for distribution through the International
Exchanges.

In order to prevent a recurrence of the sale of such material, so far as the
Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress are concerned, the Insti-
tution addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury asking that similar
instructions to those given the collector of customs at New York in 1862 and
repeated in 1897 be also issued to all the custom-houses in the United States.
I am gratified to say that a reply was received stating that instructions to
this effect would at once be given to the collectors of all the principal ports.
The collectors have also been directed to send to the Smithsonian Institution,
as soon as printed, catalogues of all auction sales in the future. A close
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 53

supervision will be kept over such sales in the hope of aiding offices and bureaus
of the Government whose publications may sometimes go astray.

It has been the practice of the International Exchanges to inclose in each
package forwarded through its service a card, properly filled out, to be receipted
by the consignee and returned to the Institution. The proper preparation
and filing of these cards would require the entire time of one clerk, but on
account of the inadequate force it has not been possible to keep a clerk solely
engaged on these cards. After careful consideration the conclusion was
reached that these receipt cards were not absolutely essential to the records of
this office. Acknowledgments of consignments sent abroad are _ received
directly from the various exchange bureaus and agencies, which themselves
usually obtain some form of receipt on the delivery of packages to their final
destinations, while packages sent to domestic addresses are forwarded by
registered mail and an acknowledgment received therefor through the post-
office. As these acknowledgments were considered sufficient for the informa-
tion of this office, the practice of inclosing receipt cards in packages was, with
your approval, abolished on January 1, 1906. Since this change it has been
possible not only to keep abreast of the work in the record room, but one of the
clerks in that room has from time to time been assigned to duty in other
branches of the service.

Some of the bureaus and others using the exchange service have occasionally
in the past included in their transmissions to the Smithsonian Institution
packages for addresses outside of the United States. While the Institution
has endeavored, in its desire to diffuse knowledge, to send to their destinations
all such publications, it was found that the burden was becoming too great
to permit of its being continued, and, with your approval, a circular letter
was sent out stating that on account of the great increase in the volume of
work the Institution would in the future be compelled to limit the use of the
exchange service by correspondents abroad solely to the forwarding of pack-
ages for addresses in the United States and territory subject to its jurisdiction.
While this change will reduce the total number of packages received from
abroad, it will not affect the returns to correspondents in this country.

The International Exchanges was established primarily for the forwarding
of books and other printed matter. It has, however, been the practice of the
Smithsonian Institution to occasionally grant permission to correspondents
to send small packages of specimens for transmission through the service.
Requests for the transmission of specimens have of late become more and
more frequent, and, in view of the original intention in the establishment of
the Exchanges, it was thought that it would be necessary in order not to
divert the use of the moneys received for carrying on the service to refuse
altogether to send specimens. However, having in mind the damage likely to
occur to such yaluable scientific material if transmitted through ordinary
channels, it was decided that the Smithsonian Institution, in the interests of
science, would continue to forward small packages of specimens, making, at
the same time, a charge for such transmissions at the rate of 8 cents per
pound for botanical specimens and 5 cents per pound for all others.

While it is not expected that any appreciable revenue will be derived
from this source, the amounts received will refund the Institution for a part
of the expenses connected with such consignments. This charge, it should be
remarked, is to apply only to correspondents in the United States and ter-
ritory subject to its jurisdiction and in those countries where the Institution
has its own paid agents. Transmissions of specimens from the Institution
are distributed without question by the various exchange bureaus abroad,
54 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

and the same courtesy will, of course, continue to be extended to them in
the forwarding of such specimens as they may send to the Institution for
correspondents in this country.

With the exception of packages for correspondents in the county of London
and those for all other places in Great Britain weighing 1 pound or less, the
agents of the Institution have, in accordance with long-standing instructions,
charged for the forwarding of exchanges from London to destination. It
seemed proper, however, that if the Institution undertook the delivery of ex-
changes at all it should be entirely without cost to the recipients, and in the
future all exchanges sent to Great Britain will be delivered to correspondents
free of expense. A part of the money which will be saved as a result of the
changes referred to in preceding paragraphs of this report will be required
for carrying into effect this improvement in the service. This additional charge
upon the resources of the International Exchanges will, however, I trust, only
be of a temporary nature, as steps have recently been taken to cause the
British Government to enter into exchange relations with the United States
and establish a bureau of its own. Such a bureau, if established, would take
charge of the entire exchange work now conducted by the Smithsonian agency
in London, thereby relieving the Institution of the burden of carrying on this
work single handed with Great Britain.

The number of complaints of delays in the transmission of packages is be-
coming more and more infrequent. In every such case during the past year
special efforts have been made to trace the cause of the delay, with a view to
overcoming it in the future if possible. It should be added that delays in the
transmission of exchanges do not, as a rule, occur in the service at Washington
nor in the offices of its agents in London, Leipzig, or Budapest, but are due prin-
cipally to the manner in which some of the exchange bureaus in other countries
are conducted—in some instances consignments remaining at such bureaus for
a great length of time before their contents are distributed. It may be stated
in this connection that there is practically no delay in the distribution of exchanges
after their arrival in Washington, packages being immediately recorded and for-
warded to their destination by registered mail under the official frank of this
Government.

In forwarding consignments to South and Central American countries it
is necessary that bills of lading be certified to by the consuls of the various
countries. In view of the nature of the contents of the consignments from the
Smithsonian Institution—consisting, as they do, of contributions gratuitously
presented and not, therefore, representing a commercial transaction—most of the
consuls perform this service free of cost to the Institution, while some make a
charge of about $2 in each instance. An effort is being made to have such fees
waived.

Requests from correspondents of the International Exchanges for publications
issued by other establishments than the Smithsonian Institution have become
so numerous that all such applicants have during the latter part of the year been
uniformly requested to apply directly to the source of publication for such books
as they may desire. When it is considered that there are over 50,000 corre-
spondents of the Exchanges, it will be appreciated that it is quite impossible
for the service to undertake the solicitation of contributions. It is furthermore
provided in the Brussels exchange convention of 1886 that the various bureaus
shall not take the initiative to bring about the establishment of exchanges.

In a recent issue of the circular of rules governing the transmission of ex-
changes a note was added that the Institution does not solicit contributions for
its correspondents,
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 55

The office collection of directories of large and important cities, catalogues
of universities and colleges, and other address books was always given special
attention by the late Secretary Langley, and it has been endeavored during the
year to make the sectional] library in the International Exchanges as complete in
this regard as possible.

In accordance with your instructions, all copy for printing for the Exchanges
has been submitted to the Secretary’s office for approval. The printing in con-
nection with the Exchanges is confined almost exclusively to letter heads and
such blank forms as are required in the work of the service, the only publication
being the International Exchange List. This list is not issued frequently,
the last edition having been published in September, 1903.

The expenses of the International Exchanges are met in part by direct appro-
priation by Congress and in part by appropriations made to Government de-
partments and bureaus, either in the contingent funds or in specific terms for
payment to the Smithsonian Institution of a portion of the cost of the trans-
portation of packages. To each of the departments or bureaus sending or re-
ceiving publications through the Smithsonian Institution a charge of 5 cents per
pound weight is made under the authority of a resolution of the Board of
Regents passed in 1878, this charge being necessary to prevent an undue tax
upon the resources of the Institution, as the appropriations made by Congress
directly to the Institution for the support of the International Hxchanges have
never been sufficient to meet the entire cost of the work. For similar reasons
it has been found necessary to make a charge of the same amount to State
institutions.

The amount appropriated by Congress for the expenses of the service during
the fiscal year 1906 was $28,800, an apparent increase over the preceding year
of $1,800. This additional amount, however, was transferred from the appro-
priation for the Library of Congress and is to cover the salaries of two persons
employed at the Smithsonian Institution in connection with exchange work for
that Library. The sum collected on account of repayments during the year
was $5,676.85, making the total amount available for carrying on the Exchanges
$34,476.85.

In this connection it should be stated that while $1,000 was added ‘to the
Exchange appropriation for 1905 in lieu of the payments which have been made
to the Smithsonian Institution for forwarding the publications of the United
States Geological Survey, the actual charge for such sendings at 5 cents per
pound would have amounted during the past year to $4,535.05. The Smith-
sonian Institution therefore received for carrying on the Exchanges $3,535.05
less than it would have under the arrangement that existed heretofore. At-
tention is called to this matter here as it may be considered advisable to bring
the facts before the Appropriations Committee during the coming session of
Congress with a view to having an additional amount added to the Exchange
appropriation.

The number of packages handled during the past year was 171,883, an in-
crease over the number for the preceding year of 6,130. The total weight of
these packages was 471,559 pounds, a decrease from 1905 of 3,312 pounds. This
decrease is probably due to the reduction of the matter printed by the Govern-
ment Departments, whose publications constitute about 67 per cent of the weight
of all exchange transmissions.

New correspondents in every part of the world are constantly being added to
the exchange list, so that they now reach a total of 56,314, an increase of 4,434
over those of the preceding year. These correspondents are subdivided as
follows: Foreign institutions, 14,620; foreign individuals, 30,471; domestic in-
56 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

stitutions, 3,773, and domestic individuals, 7,450. These correspondents should
not be considered as participating in an exchange with the Smithsonian Insti-
tution itself, but are the beneficiaries of the facilities of the international ex-
change service at home and abroad.

The following table gives the number of correspondents in each country, and
also serves to illustrate the scope of the service:

REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

comparison with the last report it will be observed that there was an increase
over the present year of 6,868 packages received from abroad for United
States Government institutions, while the number of packages sent abroad

by this Government was only 1,808 more than during last year.

As the total

number of packages received from other countries is by no means as large
as those sent by the United States, it is most gratifying to note this substan-

Consignments are now sent directly to five different establishments in Argen-
tina. As this procedure is contrary to the practice of the International Ex-
changes in the case of other countries, and as the freight charges connected
with the forwarding of exchanges to so many depositories in one country is
more than the funds at the disposal of the Institution for carrying on the
service will bear, the Department of State has been asked to ascertain through
the proper authorities of the Argentine Government whether the National
Museum at Buenos Ayres—the one to whom the largest number of sendings
are made—can not be designated to act in the future, as it did some years
ago, as the official exchange intermediary between Argentina and the United
States. It is not expected that there will be any difficulty in effecting this
improvement in the service, as Argentina in 1889 adhered to the Brussels con-
vention, which provides, among other things, for the establishment in each of
the contracting States of a bureau charged with the duty of conducting the
exchanges. Should this change be consummated there will be a material saving
to the International Exchanges in the cost of transmissions to Argentina, and at
the same time more frequent shipments will be rendered possible.

It is gratifying to state that the long-pending exchange negotiations with
China have, through the efforts of the Hon. W. W. Rockhill, American minister

at Peking, finally been brought to a successful conclusion. The Chinese Govern-
ment has designated the Shanghai bureau of foreign affairs as its representa-
tive for this purpose. While this arrangement is only for the exchange of
official publications, it is hoped that full exchange relations will be entered into
by China in the near future. Pending the arrangement of details the first ship-
ment of Government documents from the United States has not yet been made.

Owing to the death of Dr. Paul Leverkiihn, who since 1900 attended to the
reception and distribution of exchanges for Bulgaria, all transmissions to that
country have been suspended for the present. Doctor Leverkitihn was director
of the scientific institutions and library of His Royal Highness the Prince of
Bulgaria, and this office is now in correspondence with that establishment with
a view to enlisting its services in the distribution of exchanges. It should be
added that Doctor Leverkitihn during his connection with the Smithsonian
Institution was of much service in furthering the interchange of publications
between Bulgaria and the United States.

As referred to elsewhere in this report, the office of agent of the Institution
for Hungary became vacant in the latter part of June through the death of
Dr. Joseph von Korésy. Dr. Julius Pikler, who was employed by the Institu-
tion as Doctor Korésy’s assistant, has been temporarily appointed agent for
Hungary, to take effect on July 1, 1906.

Prior to the late Russo-Japanese war packages addressed to correspondents
in Korea were distributed through the courtesy of the Russian Commission
of International Exchanges at St. Petersburg. In view of the terms of the
treaty of peace, the department of foreign affairs at Tokyo—the exchange
distributing agency for Japan—was asked to undertake the distribution of
such packages as might be received at the Institution for Korean correspond-
ents. It is regretted that the Department was not able, owing to lack of proper
arrangements and sufficient funds, to comply with the Institution’s wishes in
this matter. A number of packages for Korea having accumulated at this
office, those that were within the mailing limit were forwarded to their destina-
tions and the remainder were returned to the senders with the statement that
there were at present no means of transmitting exchanges to that country.
The Korean branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at Seoul has been invited
to act as the exchange medium through which packages to and from Korea
may be forwarded. No reply has yet been received, though it is hoped that a
favorable one will come to hand at an early date.

As a more direct means of transmission, the few packages that are received
for Persia, instead of being sent through the Russian Hxchange Commission,
are now forwarded directly by mail.

All exchanges for Portuguese Hast Africa have in the past been forwarded
through the national library at Lisbon, which acts as the exchange bureau
for Portugal and its colonies. As considerable delay in the receipt of packages
sent in this manner has been experienced by correspondents in that country,
the Institution asked the Government library at Lourenco Marquez to take
charge of the reception and distribution of exchanges for Portuguese Hast
Africa. This request the Government library was good enough to comply with.

Following is a list of bureaus or agencies abroad through which the dis-
tribution of exchanges is effected. Those in the larger and in many of
the smaller countries forward to the Smithsonian Institution reciprocal con-
tributions for distribution in the United States:

With the exception of those countries with which the use of the official
frank is permitted, the distribution of exchanges to foreign countries was
made in 2,065 boxes, 265 of which contained United States Government docu-
ments for authorized depositories, and the contents of 1,800 boxes consisted of
departmental and scientific and literary publications for miscellaneous corres-
pondents. Of the latter class of exchanges, the number of boxes sent to each
country is given below:

The 50 sets of United States official publications provided for exchange pur-
poses by the joint resolution of Congress, approved March 2, 1867, have all

been placed in foreign depositories.

Finding that a still further exchange with

other Governments was necessary in order to increase the collections in the
Library of Congress, a joint resolution was approved March 2, 1901, providing
62 sets for distribution abroad in lieu of the 50 sets, as formerly. This reso-
lution also contains a provision for increasing the number of these documents

to 100 on the request of the Librarian of Congress.

Since the passage of the

latter resolution three new depositories have been added to the list of those
receiving full sets, a complete statement of which fellows:

In addition to the full set of Government documents, there are now for-
warded to provincial and municipal governments 27 partial sets. The depos-
itories of these sets have been designated by the Library of Congress from
time to time since the passage of the resolution of March 2, 1901, and have
been selected with a view to procuring such publications in return as were
especially desired by that Library.

sm 1906——5
66 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

During the year a request was received through diplomatic channels from
the Government of Lourenco Marquez for certain official publications of the
United States, to be deposited in the Government Library of that province.
This request was complied with, and the first shipment was made on December
30, 1905. This is the only addition to the list of depositories of partial sets
during the year 1906. In exchange for these documents the authorities of
Portuguese East Africa have stated that there would be sent to the United
States not only the publications of Lourenco Marquez, but also those of the
Province of Mozambique as well as of the different chartered companies.

The complete list of depositories of partial sets is as follows:
Austria-Hungary: Biirgermeister der Haupt- und Residenz-Stadt, Vienna.
Bolivia: United States Minister, La Paz.

British Columbia: Legislative Library, Victoria.

Bulgaria: Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sofia.

The chief clerk of this office, Mr. W. I. Adams, was, on June 12, 1905, tem-
porarily transferred to the Smithsonian Institution as disbursing agent, though
the International Exchanges has profited by his experience and advice on
numerous occasions.

Mr. F. W. Hodge, who was acting curator of Exchanges since February 1,
1901, terminated his services with this office on June 30, 1905, and resumed his
duties in the Bureau of American Ethnology.

Notwithstanding the fact that the work of the Exchanges has increased over
last year and the force has been reduced, the business of the office, in all its
branches, was up to date at the end of the year, there being no accumulations
on hand.

To those correspondents abroad who give their personal attention and doubt-
less often expend private means in furthering the interests of the International

Exchanges at large, the grateful acknowledgment of the Institution should be
accorded.

The appreciation of the Smithsonian Institution and its branches are due to
Mr. Charles A. King, deputy collector of the port of New York, for his constant
assistance in clearing consignments from abroad for the Institution.

In conclusion, it is my sad duty to record the death of two of the employees
of the International Exchanges—one engaged in the office at Washington and
the other employed in the service of the Exchanges at Budapest.

Dr. Joseph von Kiérésy, director of the municipal statistical office of Buda-
pest, who was appointed agent of the Smithsonian Institution for Hungary on
October 1, 1897, died June 23 of this year. Doctor K6riésy was the first regent
of the Institution for Hungary, all exchanges for that country having been
previously forwarded through the Leipzig agency. During Doctor Ké6rdésy’s
connection with the Institution he took special interest in furthering the work
of the International Exchanges, which has resulted in a material increase in
the number of packages received from correspondents in Hungary for ad-
dresses in the United States.

Mr. Solomon G. Brown, employed as packer in this office, died on June 24.
He was connected with the Smithsonian Institution almost since its founda-
tion in 1846, and he has occupied various positions under the three Secretaries,
the duties of which he always discharged with faithfulness and efficiency.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the operations of
the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1906.

The work has been conducted in accordance with a scheme approved by
the Secretary June 13, 1905, slight alterations in the expenditures therein
proposed being made from time to time as required by the exigencies of the
service.

New house for mammals.—This building, which has been under construction
for several years, is now practically completed, with the exception of the
exterior cages, walks, ete., which are yet to be made. Work on it has been
much delayed because of the difficulty of procuring suitable workmen, owing
to the great amount of building going on in the city. The amount expended
from the appropriation for the year in connection with this building is about
$11,500.

Central heating plant.—Since the inception of the park it has been desired
to establish a central plant for heating the permanent buildings of the park.
It is evident that a considerable annual saving would thus be effected, both
in fuel and in the wages of firemen. Funds have been lacking to do this
in a thoroughly satisfactory manner, but the matter seemed so urgent that a
beginning was made during the present year. ‘Two large boilers were placed
in an extension of the temporary shop building, a coal vault was excavated
in the adjoining hillside, and conduits were constructed from the boilers to
the new house for mammals, to the lion house, and to the temporary bird
house. Part of the heating mains was also installed. The cost of the work
was about $2,500.

Culvert in the beaver valley—During heavy rains a large quantity of detri-
tus is carried down the valley that extends from the western entrance of the
park to Rock Creek and which is occupied by the great flying cage, the
beaver, otter, and other inclosures. This was sometimes sufficient to dam
up the little stream that runs down the valley and thus give it sufficient force
to carry away the fences and release the animals. In order to avoid this
constantly recurring expense for clearing out the beaver dams and remov-
ing unsightly material, it was found necessary to build a concrete culvert
of considerable capacity directly through the beaver and otter yards. Its
total length was 404 feet and its cost $1,800. It is so arranged that during
an ordinary flow the water passes into the yards, while flood water is turned
into the conduit. It has been found to work satisfactorily, and it should be
extended as far up the valley as the flying cage. This would greatly improve
this part of the park, as it would prevent the wash of frequent rains, which
now disfigures it.

Repairs.—The temporary structures in which the collections were housed
when the park was first established are so rapidly deteriorating and becoming

68
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 69

unfit for occupation that a large amount of repairs to buildings and inclosures
was necessary during the year. The wire fences used for many of the inclo-
sures are seriously weakened and a general renewal will be necessary during
the coming year.

Roadways and footpaths.—These have required somewhat extensive repairs.
The steep character of most of the roads makes it difficult to keep any surface
material on them. Heavy rains almost invariably wash off the surface layer,
leaving the larger stones of the macadam bare and subject to being torn up
by the feet of horses and the wheels of carriages. To put the roads in proper
condition it will be necessary to expend considerable sums, which can not be
spared from the existing appropriation. Much trouble is also experienced
with the footpaths. They are usually made, as are the roads, with a base of
broken stone and a surface of pulverized limestone. After nearly every rain
considerable repairs are required, which constitute an important item of
expense. It would doubtless be cheaper in the end to put in at once, on the
steeper slopes, properly constructed concrete walks.

The extension of the city streets on the eastern side of the park has occasioned
an elevation of the roads, making slopes which are very unsightly and down
which a large amount of loose material is washed by rains into the park. In
order to preserve the natural beauty of this region it will be necessary to pro-
tect the grounds from invasions of this character, both by planting the slopes
and by suitably raising the grades in the park.

New survey and map.—The survey of the park, commenced last year, has been
extended over about 40 acres more. This work is of great practical utility, and
it is hoped to eventually map the entire park in this manner.

Hlectric lighting.—A local company having extended a conduit for electric
lighting as far as the entrance to the park, advantage was taken of this to
run wires to the office building and stable, which have never been furnished
heretofore with any fixed lights. It may be advisable to light also some of the
darker roadways in the park, which are quite tortuous and narrow, and there-
fore dangerous at night.

Important accessions by gift—Young male zebra and young male lion from Ras
Makonnen, governor of Harrar Province, Abyssinia, who also sent a female
zebra and a male oryx antelope, but these latter two died en route.

Polar bear, through W. S. Champ, from Zeigler Polar Relief Expedition.

From Capt. C. EH. Radclyffe, Hyde, Wareham, England, 2 red deer.

From R. MeM. Gillespie, president Chesapeake Western Railway Company,
38 black bears.

From Hon. E. H. Plumacher, American consul at Maracaibo, Venezuela, sev-
eral Venezuelan mammals and birds.

Accessions by exchange.—From the New Zealand government, 1 kiwi, 1 kea,
3 flightless rails, and 1 tuatera lizard.

From the department of crown lands, Province of Ontario, Canada, 10 black
squirrels.

From the New York Zoological Park, 4 Indian white cranes.

From dealers in animals, 1 Alaskan brown bear, a fine male markhor goat,
and several other goats, sheep, and deer.

Births.—The births, 127 in number, inelude 1 Brazilian tapir, 1 yak, 5 Bar-
bary sheep, 5 wapiti, 2 mule deer, 2 Columbian black-tailed deer, and deer
of several other species; also 2 monkeys and several kangaroos, besides a
number of wolves, arctic foxes, and other mammals.

The birds in the flying cage nested well and young were hatched by cormo-
rants, white ibis, sandhill cranes, and night herons. The pair of wild turkeys
which has the freedom of the park also nested and produced four young.
70 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

Important deaths.—Gastro-enteritis was the most prevalent trouble. The
number of cases of tuberculosis was comparatively small.

Male tiger. This animal had been in the collection thirteen years and was
quite old when received. He had been failing for some months and being unfit
for exhibition was finally chloroformed, with the consent of the owner, Mr. J. A.
Bailey.

Female tiger, from interstitial nephritis.

Jaguar, female, an old animal, in poor condition when received, from
hemorrhagic septicemia.

Grizzly bear, brain showed pathological features in both hemispheres, one
side suggesting results of old abscess, but immediate cause of death was not
distinctly ascertained by the autopsy.

One sea lion, from gastro-enteritis.

American bison, one calf from gastro-enteritis, and one old male from broken
spine.

Two Arabian camels, one from gastro-enteritis, the other from tuberculosis.

One Rocky Mountain sheep, from gastro-enteritis.

Young male zebra, from accident.

One cassowary, from filariasis.

One emu, from gastro-enteritis.

One rhea, from pleuro-pneumonia.

Two Indian white cranes and several other birds, from aspergillosis.

All dead animals which were in fit condition for preservation were trans-
mitted to the National Museum, the number sent during the year being 226.
Autopsies were made by pathologists of the Bureau of Animal Industry, who
also assisted with sick and diseased animals.

Visitors—The use of the park by schools and as a place of recreation is
steadily increasing. On April 16, 1906, Easter Monday, it was estimated that
28,000 people, mostly children, were on the grounds during the day.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Sir: The character and value of property pertaining to the Astrophysical
Observatory are approximately as follows:

VESU GDN ESS pe a 2 wR al ee 5 ee ee ee $8, 900
SANOORUORIOTS) | eee! le oe ae a ee ee ee eee 46, 300

During the past year a small fireproof shelter has been erected in the north-
east corner of the Observatory inclosure to contain storage batteries and an
alternating-current generator, and to serve as a distributing center for all the
electrical currents used for the Observatory. An underground power line has
been laid by the electric lighting company to connect the Observatory and
the main Smithsonian building directly with the main on B street independently
of the National Museum. This fireproof building and power line cost $1,400.

The two shelters occupied in 1905 by the expedition on Mount Wilson have
been improved in a manner adapting them to maintain a more uniform tem-
perature, and a tower and third small shelter for cloud reflection experiments
have been erected. The total cost for these improvements was $200.

Apparatus for research has been procured at a cost of $1,000, of which $200
was chargeable to the appropriation of 1905-6.

The usual scientific periodicals have been continued, a few books of reference
have been purchased, and some periodicals and books have been bound at a
total cost for the Observatory library of $60.

No losses of property have occurred.

Personnel.—The Observatory suffered the loss of its distinguished founder
and director in the death of Secretary S. P. Langley, on February 27, 1906.

Mr. L. R. Ingersoll served as temporary bolometric assistant from July 1,
1905, to September 8, 1905, and again from June 16, 1906, to July 1, 1906.

Miss F. A. Graves was appointed computer beginning January 10, 1906.

WorkK OF THE OBSERVATORY.

During the past year the work of the Observatory has been steadily directed
with the aim of securing proof of the suspected variability of the sun, but for
convenience the year’s work will be described under the following classification :

1. Miscellaneous work.

2. Observations at Washington.

3. Observations on Mount Wilson.

4. General statement of results.

MISCELLANEOUS WORK.

Preparation for publication.—The research on a possible variability of the
solar radiation has been continued so long and has given promise of leading
to results of such definiteness and importance as to justify its publication as

73
74 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

Volume II of Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory. Considerable time has
been occupied by the aid acting in charge in the preparation of the text for
this volume, which it is hoped to publish during the coming fiscal year.

Computation of results.—The reduction of observations of solar radiation and
solar absorption has occupied the main portion of the time of the junior assist-
ant and computer, but without interfering with the continuation in Washington
of the series of observations on the absorption of the solar envelope and the
solar radiation. Improved methods of reduction have been devised, so that the
task of reducing a single day’s work is not as heavy as formerly.

Improvements of apparatus.—In earlier reports the principles embodied in a
new form of standard pyrheliometer have been set forth. It may be recalled,
however, that in this instrument the solar radiation, which passes at right
angles through a circular aperture of known area, is principally absorbed at
the rear end of a cylindrical hollow chamber, and that such portions of heat or
radiation as escape from the rear end of the chamber are absorbed at other
points along its walls, so that heat is almost wholly prevented from escaping at
the entrance. The heat thus fully absorbed within the chamber is taken up by
a current of water which flows steadily at a measured rate in a spiral course
round the walls of the chamber, entering at the front and leaving at the rear;
and the rise of temperature of the water is determined by a piatinum resist-
ance thermometer. Thus the rate of solar radiation is measured by the
rise of temperature it produces in a known amount of water. A definite
check on the accuracy of the instrument is had by introducing a measured
electric current through a coil of wire situated within the chamber, thus pro-
ducing a known amount of heat there. The agreement between this amount of
heat and the amount carried off by the flowing water, as determined by means
of the recording apparatus, is the evidence of the excellence of the pyrheliometer.
In practice the instrument has now come to a high state of perfection, and
forms a valuable part of the equipment on Mount Wilson. Various improve-
ments of the means of promoting a satisfactory circulation of the water and of
measuring its rise of temperature have been introduced during the year.

Several copies of an improved form of secondary pyrheliometer have been
made at the Observatory shop and added to the equipment. This instrument,
though coming by a kind of evolution from Pouillet’s water pyrheliometer,
has now become very different from it. The receiving surface is a copper
disk blackened by smoke. <A cylindrical bulb thermometer is inserted radially
in a hole at the side of the disk, and its connection with the disk improved
by filling the hole with mercury, which is prevented from spilling by packing
at the mouth of the hole. A hollow copper sphere incloses the disk, and this
is protected from outside temperatures by being inclosed in a wooden sphere.
The solar rays pass down a diaphragmed tube and fall at right angles upon
the copper disk. When reading the instrument, it is alternately shaded and
exposed to the sun at two-minute intervals, and the rate of rise of temperature
of the disk is determined from thermometer readings made each twenty sec-
onds. Readings with this instrument must be compared with those of the
standard pyrheliometer to reduce them to the absolute scale, but as between
themselves the readings appear to be accurate to half of 1 per cent indepen-
dent of wind or temperature outside.

The bolometer also has received very essential improvements, one of them
consisting of a device for abolishing “drift” in situations where it is not
possible to maintain the bolometer at uniform temperature. This is done by
introducing as a part of one of the balancing coils of the bolometer a little
copper wire in place of an equal resistance of wire of zero temperature coeffi-
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. ~° 75

cient. For a good bolometer only 1 or 2 per cent of the resistance needs to be
thus substituted. The improvement obtained on Mount Wilson is so great
that the “drift” in a single bolograph now rarely reaches a centimeter,
although a rise of temperature of nearly 2 degrees centigrade per hour may
be taking place. The bolometric apparatus may be conveniently balanced by
the aid of a variable shunt of high resistance round one of the balancing
coils. This device is employed now instead of a slide wire for determining
the sensitiveness of the platinum thermometer used with the standard pyrheli-
ometer.

Some trial has been made of a new device of entirely different principle, as
a rival of the bolometer and its class of instruments. This new instrument is
not yet fully perfected, but gives some promise of exceeding in sensitiveness
either the bolometer, the thermopile, the radiometer, or the radio-micrometer.

OBSERVATIONS AT WASHINGTON,

Notwithstanding the fact that it has been deemed expedient for the satis-
factory proof of the variability or constancy of solar radiation to conduct many
of the observations at the favorable station on Mount Wilson, still the obserya-
tions at Washington remain of hardly less importance than before. For the
determination of the amount of solar radiation outside the earth’s atmosphere
depends so largely on our estimate of the loss by scattering and absorption
of the rays in the air that very much of the confidence with which we may
hope the work will ultimately be regarded must be produced by the number
and weight of the circumstances which tend to establish the accuracy of the
estimate of the effect of the earth’s atmosphere. Chief in importance among
such checks is the simultaneous observation of the sun’s radiation at stations
remote from one another and different in altitude, like Washington and Mount
Wilson. When it is said that the solar radiation received at the earth’s sur-
face on Mount Wilson generally exceeds that in Washington by a third, but
that, nevertheless, simultaneous spectrobolometric observations at high and low
sun at the two places yield substantially identical values of the solar radiation
outside the atmosphere, the soundness of the work seems strongly verified.
In order to secure as many checks of this kind as possible, solar constant deter-
minations have been made by Mr. Fowle in Washington at all times when the
sky conditions warranted. Apparently a very considerable rise of the solar
constant values, occurring in January after Mr. Abbot’s return from Mount
Wilson, was observed at Washington alone. As in former years, the number of
days suitable for these observations in Washington has been small.

Another important independent method of securing evidence of the varia-
bility of the sun is found in the bolometric examination of the solar image to
measure the absorption taking place in the sun’s immediate surroundings.
This observation depends but little on the clearness of the earth’s atmos-
phere, and can therefore be carried on about as well in Washington as any-
where. As stated in former reports, the Observatory is provided for this work
with a horizontal reflecting telescope of 20 inches aperture and 140 feet focus,
easily one of the largest telescopes of the world. Observations with the spec-
trobolometer at the focus of this great telescope have been carried on regularly
by Mr. Fowle throughout the year. Improved means for stirring the column
of air within the telescope tube to improve definition have been provided,
but, requiring additional electrical facilities, their trial was postponed to
await the completion of the electric station above referred to.
76 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.
OBSERVATIONS ON MOUNT WILSON.

The departure of an expedition in charge of Mr. Abbot to Mount Wilson, in
California, in May, 1905, and the circumstances which led to its location there
in response to the kind invitation of the direetor of the Carnegie Solar Ob-
servatory and the president of the Carnegie Institution were mentioned in last
year’s report. Observations were continued by the expedition on Mount Wilson
until October 27, 1905, when the approach of cold weather and the frequent
rise of fog over the mountain made the observing so difficult, especially in the
temporary shelter in which the bolometric apparatus was situated, that Mr.
Abbot was recalled. By request and invitation of the officials of the Carnegie
Institution most of the apparatus was left in place on Mount Wilson, in order
to provide in some way for the continuation of solar constant work there during
1906. Later it was cetermined to renew the Smithsonian expedition, and Mr.
Abbot returned about May 5, 1906, and after June 15, 1906, was again aided,
as in 1905, by Mr. L. R. Ingersoll, temporary bolometric assistant .

During 1905 the solar constant was observed on Mount Wilson on fifty-six days,
depending on about 600 bolographs and about 1,000 pyrheliometer readings.
Observations were made on a number of days on the transmission of the solar
envelope and in sun spots. Pyrheliometer readings were made on Mount San
Antonio (over 10,000 feet high) simultaneous with solar constant determina-
tions on Mount Wilson (6,000 feet high). A few days of observation were de-
voted to the determination of the reflective power of clouds and the scattering
of light by the sky.

In 1906 additional instrumental equipment was provided, and a tower has
been erected at the point of a ridge overlooking deep canyons on three sides for
use in conducting from its summit careful measurements by the bolometer of
the comparative brightness of equal angular areas of cloud and sun at all
solar altitudes, and thus to determine what effect clouds have on the total
amount of solar radiation available to the earth. Almost ideal conditions for
this experiment are often had on Mount Wilson, for a level-topped sea of fog
often rises and remains stationary for hours within a few hundred feet of
the base of the tower above mentioned. It is also intended to observe the
brightness of the sky with the bolometer, making supplementary spectro-
photometric eye observations. Solar constant determinations were begun by
Mr. Abbot about May 15, 1906, and are being continued almost every day, ex-
cept when clouds prevent. As regards transparency of sky and freedom from
clouds, the conditions in 1906 are much less favorable than they were in 1905
on Mount Wilson. It may be possible that the prolonged eruption of Mount
Vesuvius has had a similar effect to that of the great eruption of Krakatoa
in 1883 in perturbing the air. It will be interesting to see if the observa-
tions of others indicate a general decrease of the transparency of the earth’s
atmosphere.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF RESULTS.

Reserving for the forthcoming Volume II of the Annals of the Astrophysical
Observatory a detailed statement of the results obtained and a discussion of
them, the principal results of the year may be summarized as follows:

A. Agreement between Washington and Mount Wilson solar constant
observations.

So far as the reductions have enabled the results to be compared, there
seems to be no difference of a systematic kind between Washington and Mount
Wilson spectro-bolometric determinations of the solar radiation outside the
earth’s atmosphere. The probable error of Mount Wilson determinations is
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 77

naturally smaller, owing to the high altitude and clear sky, but the results for
the two stations in general agree within 2 or 8 per cent, and thus within
the probable error of the Washington observations.

Considering the great difference in altitude of the stations, this tends
strongly to increase confidence in the soundness of the method of “solar con-
stant’ determination employed.

B. Absolute value of the “‘ solar constant.”

Preliminary comparisons between the secondary pyrheliometers heretofore
used and the standard pyrheliometers now perfected indicate that the prelimi-
nary scale of values of the ‘solar constant” heretofore published in these
reports is probably very nearly correct. During the observations in 1905 on
Mount Wilson the solar radiation was generally below the mean value of about
2.12 calories as observed at Washington, and averaged about 2.03 calories.

C. Estimation of the “ solar constant” by the pyrheliometer alone.

As stated in last year’s report, Mr. Fowle has found that a fairly close value
of the solar radiation outside our atmosphere may be obtained on good days
in Washington by making an exponential treatment of high and low sun obser-
vations obtained with the pyrheliometer alone and adding 14 per cent to the
value reached outside the atmosphere. As was to be expected, the empirical
correcting factor is found to be smaller than 14 per cent when the Mount Wil-
son observations are treated in this manner, and it is also more variable—
ranging from 8 to 12 per cent—probably depending on the humidity of the air.
Some ten years ago Prof. K. Angstr6m made observations at high altitudes
on the island of Teneriffe with his pyrheliometer. This instrument reads
lower than our standard pyrheliometer, so that a correction must be added to
his observations to make them comparable with ours. Applying a correction
for this cause and reducing Angstriém’s observations by the exponential method
and adding 10 per cent (the mean of the corrections determined on Mount Wil-
son) we obtain for mean soiar distance 2.25 calories for the solar constant
during Angstriém’s Teneriffe experiments of 1895, a value about as much higher
than the mean given under B as the Mount Wilson mean value is below it. This
value is well below the highest values found by spectrobolometriec work at
Washington within recent years. Thus the best modern pyrheliometry is not
discorded with the view that the “solar constant” is close to 2.12 calories.

D. Evidence of solar variability.

In general, the solar constant determinations obtained on Mount Wilson have
internal evidence of being of very great weight. For example, the exponen-
tial plots of the kind published as Plate VI in my report for the year ending
June 30, 1903, often have eight or ten points distributed over a range of air
mass three times that which the sun shines through in the zenith, all lying
within 1 per cent of the representative straight line. So far as can be seen it
appears that the Mount Wilson determinations of solar radiation outside our
atmosphere are usually accurate relatively to 1 per cent or better. The obser-
yations between June 1 and August 5, 1905, are on the average higher than those
between August 5 and October 27. But fluctuations of from 5 to 8 per cent
occur repeatedly, and often in periods of about ten days.

Washington observations confirmed the results of September and October,
but were lacking in July and August owing to bad observing weather. In De-
cember excellent days were had in Washington, indicating low values, but in
78 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

January the numbers rose very high, and the results became as high or higher
than any before recorded and remained through most of February fully 15
per cent above the Mount Wilson values of late August. After this there was
again a falling off, and the Mount Wilson work of May and June, 1906, gives
about the same results as the corresponding months of 1905. By anticipation
it may be added that July, 1906, does not appear to run parallel to July, 1905,
by bringing higher values.

On the whole the solar-radiation work of the past year furnishes the strong-
est evidence of solar variability yet recorded by this Observatory.

Eh. Confirmatory indications of solar variability.

While lack of knowledge of the conditions surrounding the sun makes con-
clusions drawn from a study of the apparent absorption of the solar envelope
doubtful, still the following inferences seem to be reasonable. If the solar
envelope should decrease in transmissibility, the solar radiation ought at first
to diminish, but after a time the radiating substance behind the absorbing
envelope should increase in temperature, owing to the obstruction of its radia-
tion by the absorbing envelope, so that at length the solar radiation should
reach nearly its former value despite the greater absorption in the envelope.
Similarly a falling off in solar absorption should immediately produce
increased radiation and afterwards a decrease of radiation.

The observations of the solar image made at Washington and Mount Wilson
in the past fiscal year are not yet so completely reduced as to be profitably com-
pared with the observations of solar radiation on the basis of this hypothesis.
But it may be noted that during the month of July, while solar radiation
appeared to be increasing, the transparency of the solar envelope appeared to
be increasing also, which is in accordance with expectation. Furthermore,
the values representing the solar transmission at this time were below the
mean values for several years, which also accord with expectation.

Lack of knowledge of the local conditions which govern the earth’s tem-
perature prevents us from making at the present time accurate forecasts of
the effect of a variation of the sun on the earth’s climate. Thus, for example,
a decrease of solar radiation may cause in some localities a decrease of cloudi-
vess sufficient to allow as much sunlight to reach the earth as came before the
fall of solar radiation took place. For the world in general, however, it might
naturally be expected that a decrease of solar radiation would cause a fal! of
the earth’s temperature. It is therefore in accordance with expectation that
the summer and early winter of 1905 were cooler than the average, while in
January and February, 1906, there was uncommon mildness, followed by a
cool spring.

SUM MARY.

The work of the Astrophysical Observatory for the year has principally con-
sisted in the continuation at Washington and on Mount Wilson of researches
designed to discover any variability of solar radiation. The results of the year’s
work have furnished the strongest evidence yet secured that the solar radiation
reaching the limits of the earth’s atmosphere varies frequently and notably in
amount. According to present information, the mean value of the solar coustant
of radiation is not far from 2.12 calories per square centimeter per minute; its
range of fluctuation is irregular and sometimes reaches 15 per cent, and its
periods of fluctuation are variable.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report on the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1906:

There have been recorded as accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the
Library of Congress 1,754 volumes, 14,192 parts of volumes, 4,250 pamphlets, and
h22 charts, making a total of 20,718 publications ; extending the accession num-
bers from 468,087 to 475,178. <A few of these publications have been held, being
immediately necessary for reference in connection with the scientific work of
the Institution, but the greater part was sent direct to the Library of Congress.
‘he publications sent to the Library of Congress were transmitted in 293 boxes,
and are estimated to have amounted to an equivalent of 11,720 volumes, exclu-
sive of public documents presented to the Institution and forwarded to the
Library of Congress at once without stamping or recording, as well as public
documents or other gifts to the Library of Congress received through the Inter-
national Exchange Service.

The selecting and sending to the Library of Congress of volumes and parts of
volumes that had been held for the use of the staff in the past years have been
continued as far as the current work would allow.

The libraries of the Secretary, Office Astrophysical Observatory, and Na-
tional Zoological Park have received 542 volumes, pamphlets, and charts, and
1,832 parts of volumes, making a total of 2,374, and a grand total, including
books for the Smithsonian deposit and the Watts de Peyster Collection, of
2A S20:

The parts of serial publications that were entered on the card catalogue num-
bered 25,666. One thousand five hundred and fifty-seven slips for completed
volumes were made, and 600 cards for new periodicals and annuals were added
to the permanent record from the periodical recording desk.

Inaugural dissertations and academic publications were received from uni-
versities at the following places:

Baltimore (Jobns Hopkins). Wiel.

Basel. Leipzig.

Bern. Marburg.

Breslau. New York (Columbia).

80 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

In carrying out the plan to effect new exchanges and to secure missing parts
to complete sets, 1,541 letters were written, resulting in 287 new periodicals
being added to the receipts, while 631 defective series were partly or entirely
completed. In addition to the letters referred to, 99 postal cards were mailed
and 73 missing parts were received in response.

As a result of a suggestion of the Librarian of Congress, it was decided that
reprints of articles in periodicals or transactions and circulars, ete., ephemeral
in nature and purpose, would be retained at the Institution.

The plan adopted by the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature
of sending to authors lists of their scientific writings that have been indexed
in the Catalogue, and requesting any that have not been cited, has proven of
special benefit to the library of the Institution, as a number of separates on
American material have been added in this way.

In the reference room 201 volumes of the transactions and proceedings of
learned societies were withdrawn, and from the reading room 25 bound yolumes
of periodicals and 3,885 parts of scientific perlodicals and popular magazines
were borrowed. The use of fhese publications and those in the sectional
libraries of the Institution by persons from other bureaus of the Government
has been continued, but in the main the consultation has been by members of
the staff.

The mail receipts numbered 34,716 packages, the publications contained
therein being stamped and distributed for entry from the mail desk. Four
thousand eight hundred acknowledgments were made on the regular form, ex-
clusive of those for publications received in response to the requests of the
Institution for exchange.

There has been no change in the number of the sectional libraries main-
tained in the Institution, they being the Secretary’s library, office library, and
the employee’s library, together with those of the Astrophysical Observatory,
aerodromics, international exchanges, and law reference.

At the request of the Aero Club of America the Smithsonian Institution
exhibited in the aeronautical section of the automobile show, held in New
York City, 48 volumes of publications on aeronautics from the section of
aerodromics.

The current periodicals in the Astrophysical Observatory have been collated,
missing numbers secured, and 388 volumes were bound. ‘The library at the
National Zoological Park had an addition of 19 volumes and 25 pamphlets,
which were received by gift and purchase.

The employee’s library.—The number of books borrowed from the employee’s
library was 1,216, and the sending of a selected number of the books from this
library to the National Zoological Park and the Bureau of American Hthnology
each month continues to be appreciated.

The John Donnell Smith library.—While this library is still in the possession
of Mr. John Donnell Smith, a book plate has been provided and under the direc-
tion of Mr. Smith copies have been placed in each of the volumes, about 1,700
in number, so that their identification, when they are finally forwarded to the
Institution, may be complete.

The Watts de Peyster collection.—Through the continued munificence of Gen.
John Watts de Peyster, the Watts de Peyster collection has received an addition
of 1,234 volumes.

Tibetan manuscript.—Warly in the year a unique Tibetan manuscript, entitled
“Prajna Paramita,” i. e., Transcendental Wisdom, was received as a gift from
the government of India. It is written in gold characters on black ground of
366 cardboards, which are held between two covers of lacquered wood, and

was collected by Lieutenant-Colonel Waddell, archeologist of the Indian gov-
ernment expedition to Tibet in 1904-5, during this expedition. The height
is 10 inches; width, 174 inches; thickness, 7 inches.

The art room.—The collection of prints and art publications in the art room
has been thoroughly reexamined. A tentative arrangement has been made of
the prints which are now being catalogued, they having been placed in paper
folders and made ready for permanent arrangement. The serial publications
are being collated and prepared for binding when the opportunity offers.

The Museum library.—The National Museum library has been exceptionally
fortunate in gifts this year, having received the following valuable donations:

A copy of the magnificent publication Investigations and Studies in Jade,
in two volumes, profusely illustrated by American, European, and Chinese
artists, from the estate of the late Heber R. Bishop. Mr. Bishop, who donated
his large collection of jades and other hard stones to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, of the city of New York, gave much of his time for many years to the
preparation of a treatise on jade and a catalogue illustrating his collection.
The publication of the work was left to his executors and the number of copies
was limited to 100, to be distributed to members of his family, heads of goy-
ernments, and the principal libraries and museums having libraries in this
and other countries; the United States National Museum was included in the
distribution.

Prof. Lester F. Ward, for many years connected with the Museum in an
honorary capacity, presented his collection of paleobotanical and botanical
books, pamphlets, and memoirs of all kinds that were in the National Museum
building. Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator of birds, presented a collection of
publications consisting of a large number of separates on natural history and
a complete set of the Proceedings of the United States National Museum, and
Dr. Charles W. Richmond, assistant curator of the same division, has given a
series of valuable works, numbering over 100, on natural history and travel.
Prof. O. T. Mason and Dr. C. A. White have continued to add to their col-
lections presented some years ago, and many valuable publications have come
to the library in this way.

In the Museum library there are now 27,726 volumes, 44,075 unbound papers,
and 108 manuscripts. The additions during the year consisted of 3,556 books,
5,327 pamphlets, and 105 parts of volumes. There were catalogued 1,848
books, of which 136 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit, and 4,864 pamphlets,
of which 116 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit, and 12,228 parts of periodi-
cals, of which 640 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit. In the accession book
8,556 volumes, 5,327 pamphlets, and 105 parts of volumes were recorded. The
number of cards added to the catalogue was 8,439.

In connection with the entering of periodicals memoranda were made re-
porting volumes and parts missing in the sets, together with a few titles of
publications that were not represented in the library. The result of this work
was the completing or partial filling up of 40 sets of periodicals.

Attention has been given to the preparation of volumes for binding, with the
result that 290 books were sent to the Government bindery.

The number of books, periodicals, and pamphlets borrowed from the general
library amounted to 28,924, including 19,354, which were assigned to the sec-
tional libraries. This does not include, however, the large number of books
consulted in the library but not withdrawn.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

The Smithsonian Institution continued during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1906, the preparation of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature in
cooperation with other countries of the world.

There were sent from here during the year 25,601 classified citations to Amer-
ican scientific literature, as follows:

ontology, Human Anatomy, Chemistry, Mineralogy, Meteorology, Botany, Phys-
ical Anthropology, and Zoology.

Geology, Paleontology, Physics, and Mineralogy.

The first meeting of the International Convention of the International Cata-
logue of Scientific Literature was held in London July 25-26, 1905, there being
REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY. 83

present one or more delegates from each of the following named countries:
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, India, Italy, Japan,
Mexico, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States of
America, whose delegate, appointed by the Smithsonian Institution, was Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger, of the United States National Museum.

In the International Convention is vested the supreme control of the Cata-
logue, and in the beginning of the undertaking it was agreed that its meetings
should be held in 1905, 1910, and thereafter every ten years. At the meeting
in 1905 the convention was expected to pass judgment on the value and impor-
tance of the project and on the advisability of continuing the work beyond the
first period of five years, which will end with the publication of the volumes for
1905. Another important subject before the convention was that of reviewing
and, if necessary, revising the classification schedules as originally agreed on.
Regarding the first question it was unanimously resolved:

“That in view of the success already achieved by the International Catalogue
of Scientific Literature, and of its great importance to scientific workers, it is
imperative to continue the publication of the Catalogue at least for a further
period of five years.”

The classification schedules were referred to a committee, who, after having
met and considered all suggestions from the various bureaus throughout the
world, decided to continue the general methods in use up to that time, though
making many minor changes in the schedules. Some additions were required
to fill omissions in the original sghedules, and others also were necessary to
provide suitable places for the numerous scientific subjects which had devel-
oped since the beginning of the enterprise.

The zoological section of the Catalogue, through an understanding with the
Zoological Society of London, will become amalgamated with the Zoological
Record, which has been for years the standard zoological yearbook. By this
method the International Catalogue gains the services of some of the foremost
zoologists in the world.

All of the references to zoology collected by the various regional bureaus of
the catalogue throughout the world will be submitted for approval to the ex-
perts of the Zoological Society, who, in the future as in the past, will be in
charge of the Zoological Record, which, beginning with the literature of 1906,
will be published as the zoology volume of the International Catalogue.

Early in 1901 the actual work of preparing the International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature was begun, and during and since that time the Smith-
sonian Institution has felt obliged to allot each year a sum of money from its
own limited funds to carry on the work in this country. The Institution has
each year felt that even the small sum set apart for the work was a serious
drain on its resources, and each year the hope was entertained that Congress
would make a suitable appropriation for carrying on the work on behalf of the
United States.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents on January 24, 1906, it was decided to
approach Congress in the hope of obtaining financial aid. By the authority
thus given the Institution took the necessary steps to bring the matter to the
attention of Congress, with the result that an item was inserted in the sundry
civil bill worded as follows:

“International Catalogue of Scientific Literature: For the cooperation of the
United States in the work of the International Catalogue of Scientific Litera-
ture, including the preparation of a classified index catalogue of American
scientific publications for incorporation in the International Catalogue, the ex-
pense of clerk hire, the purchase of necessary books and periodicals, and other
84 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

necessary incidental expenses, $5,000, the same to be expended under the direc-
tion of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.”

In concluding this report I can not but refer to the loss which the library of
the Institution shares with the entire establishment in the death of the Secre-
tary, Mr. S. P. Langley. His first services in connection with the Institution
were, in considerable measure, devoted to its library during the term of his
office as Assistant Secretary. Later, as Secretary, he reorganized the library
system, bringing together in one centralized administration the libraries of the
Institution and Museum and of the other branches of the Institution, with the
single exception of the Bureau of Ethnology. No one used the library more
constantly than did the tate Secretary, and no one observed its rules so faith-
fully. He was interested in every class of literature that came here and in all
the departments of library work. Not only the general plan for the carrying
on and increase of the library, but all of its details were known to him, and he
made constant suggestions for the improvement of the work and repeated
inquiries as to its progress.

Under his administration the quarters assigned to the library were multiplied
many times, and his interest in the members of the staff led him to establish a
general reading room for those who were not strictly connected with the
scientific work; and also later he established a sort of circulating library,
which even had a traveling section for the benefit of the employees of the
National Zoological Park and the Bureau of Ethnology. He greatly promoted
bibliographical work, both in the matter of publication as well as in the support
which he gave to the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature.

The Secretary was a daily donor to the library, since he made it a rule to
present to it, with a few trifling exceptions, all of the valuable scientific works
which were given him, either in exchange for his own publications or because
of his distinguished position in the scientific world.

I ean not but feel that the library, more than the other branches of the Smith-
sonian work, has met with an irreparable loss in his passing away, for joined
with his eminence as an original investigator he was essentially a book man
and had a profound and direct interest in everything relating to the book world—
scientific, historical, and literary.

REPORT ON THE LEWIS AND CLARK CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION,
PORTLAND, OREGON, 1905.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the exhibit of the
Smithsonian Institution and National Museum at the Lewis and Clark Cen-
tennial Exposition held at Portland, Oregon, from June 1 to October 14, 1905,
inclusive:

An act of Congress approved April 18, 1904, provided for a Government
exhibit to be made by the several Executive Departments, bureaus, and other
organizations, including the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum,
under the management of a Government board. The sum of $200,000 was
appropriated for this exhibit, another appropriation of $25,000 was authorized
for an exhibit by the district of Alaska, and $250,000 was appropriated for the
construction of suitable buildings.

The main Government building was located on an islandlike peninsula in
the lake included in the exposition grounds. This peninsula was connected
with the main portion of the exhibition grounds by the “ Bridge of Nations,”
which was about one-third of a mile in length. Adjoining the main building
on the south, and connected with it by a colonnade, was a smaller building for
the exhibits of the Bureau of Fisheries of the Department of Commerce and
Labor; while a similar building was on the north side, containing the exhibits
of Alaska and the Philippine Islands. Behind the latter was another and
smaller building containing irrigation and forestry exhibits.

The total floor space of the Government building and its annexes was about
80,000 square feet. The portion in the Government building assigned to the
Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, comprising about 5,000 square
feet, was located in the rear of the building and had no frontage on the main
aisle, but was divided into two unequal parts by a secondary aisle.

In accordance with the intent of the law, the Government exhibit consisted
chiefly of portions of the exhibits made at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition
during the preceding year. The plans formulated for the exhibits of the Smith-
sonian Institution and its bureaus were entirely along the lines laid down at
the St. Louis Exposition, although the choice of specimens required considerable
care, as the space allotted to the Institution and the National Museum was only
about one-third of the area of the space assigned to them at the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION PROPER.

This exhibit, which was placed against the west wall of the Smithsonian
space, comprised pictures of James Smithson, founder of the Institution, a
facsimile of his will, a cast of the bronze tablet placed on his tomb at Genoa,
Italy, and views of the tomb itself, and a photograph of the mortuary chapel
in the Smithsonian Institution where Smithson’s remains now rest; photo-

graphie portraits of the Regents, the Chancellors, and the Secretaries of the
institution; papers and medals relating to the Hodgkins fund; a complete
set of the publications of the Institution; an enlarged photograph of the
Smithsonian seal, and pictures of the Smithsonian and Museum buildings.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service exhibited a statistical chart showing its
operations from its founding up to 1904 and photographs of its offices, all of
which objects were hung on the western portion of north wall.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The Observatory showed several large charts illustrating the results of its
investigations upon solar radiation, the most conspicuous of which was that
of the infra-red spectrum. AJ] were placed on the western portion of the north
wall, together with transparencies representing solar eclipses, sun spots, ete.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Just to the west of the north door were shown enlarged photographie views
of some of the animals living in the park and of the animal houses and
paddocks, together with a model of the park, and maps showing details of the
park and its location in the city of Washington.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY,

This exhibit, representing the researches of one of the ethnologists of the
Bureau, consisted of a series of 55 models and 2 originals of shields and 8
models of tepees of the Kiowa Indians, illustrative of many of their beliefs
and customs. This exhibit was placed in the west section of the wall case.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.
I. Department of Anthropology.

The exhibit of this department of the Museum was installed in the west sec-
tion of the Smithsonian space. It comprised reproductions, on a reduced scale,
of five of the temples, or palaces, built by the Indians of the ancient civiliza-
tions of Mexico and Yucatan. The structures shown were: “Temple of the
Cross” at Palenque, the ‘‘ Castle” at Chitzen-Itza, the ‘“ Governor’s Palace” at
Uxmal, the ‘Temple of Xochicalco,’ and a temple at Mitla. Photographs,
Plans, and diagrams of these and other ruins were shown separately, as well as
some full-size details of the temples.

II. Department of Geology.

This exhibit, which was placed in the central portion of the Smithsonian
space, embraced :

1. A systematic collection of minerals, represented by unusually large speci-
mens.

2. An exhibit of meteorites, which comprised, (a) plaster casts of three
meteorites collected by Commander Peary, U. S. Navy, in north Greenland, the
largest one being the greatest mass ever known to have fallen from the sky;
90 REPORT OF THE ACTING SECRETARY.

(b) a plaster cast of the Bacubirito meteorite in Mexico, another remarkably
large piece of nickel-iron; (¢c) a plaster cast of the Ainsa-Irwin, or Tucson
(Arizona) meteorite, in the ferm of a ring of iron, the original of which is in
the National Museum; (d) a map showing the location of known meteorite
falls in the United States; (e) pictures of falling meteorites, or ‘“ shooting
stars,’ and photographs showing the internal structure of stony, iron, and
stony-iron meteorites.

3. Representations of some interesting fossil vertebrates of North America,
which comprised: (a) Life-sized restoration of the armored dinosaur, Stego-
saurus ungulatus, showing the supposed external appearance of the animal,
based on remains in the National Museum; (b) natural-sized restoration of the
skeleton of the three-horned dinosaur, J'riceratops pororsus, from the origi-
nal in the National Museum. On the wall was hung an oil painting repre-
senting the external appearance of this great reptile in its native surroundings;
(c) pictures showing skeletons or restorations of other dinosaurs, of an
icthyosaur. of a pterydactyle (or flying reptile), and of an extinct toothed
diving bird.

Ill. Department of Biology.

This department, situated at the east end of the Smithsonian space, showed:

1. A nearly complete skeleton of the dodo, Diduws ineptus, an extinet flight-
less bird of the island of Mauritius. A few living birds were brought to Hol-
land in the sixteenth century, and from these at least four different pictures
were painted by various artists. One of the best of these, a life-sized profile,
is in the British Museum, and an exact reproduction of it was hung near the
skeleton.

2. A complete skeleton (made up from bones of many individuals) of the
great auk, Plautus impennis. A cast of its egg and a natural-sized photo-
graph of the mounted specimen in the National Museum were also exhibited.

3. A collection of birds’ eggs from all parts of the world, including eggs of
common birds, bright-colored eggs, eggs of the humming-bird, the smallest, and
a cast of the largest egg known, that of the Apyornis, an extinct bird of
Madagascar.

4. A series of bright-colored pheasants of the Old World, together with a
pair each of three species of peacocks.

5. A mounted American alligator arid an American crocodile, placed opposite
one another in order to show clearly the differences between these two largest
existing American reptiles.

G6. A group of large game animals of Europe, Asia, and Africa: Chamois,
Norway elk, moufilon, Manchurian tiger, Marco Pouo sheep, axis deer, Sambur
stag, lion, and rhinoceros. In addition to these, mounted heads of the nilghi,
greater and lesser kudus, Jackson’s hartebeeste, beisa antelope, and ibex, and
antlers of the American elk and caribou were hung on the walls.

7. At various places on the walls of the Smithsonian exhibit-space were placed
plates taken from Audubon’s work on North American birds, among them one
of the great auk. Another series of pictures comprised photographs showing the
making of a cast of a sulphur bottom whale at Balena Station, Newfoundland.

8. Suspended over the center of the Smithsonian space was a skeleton of
an adult little piked whale, Balenoptera acuto-rostrata.

Dr. FE. W. True was representative for the Smithsonian Institution and
National Museum on the Government board. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., was chief
special agent.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO TE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1906
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the Genrerat Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

Tt has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of
its history, been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology.. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of pages (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1906.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Smithsonian Institution is an establishment at Washington,
founded by act of Congress approved August 10, 1846, in accordance
with a bequest of James Smithson, an Englishman, “ for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.” The act creates, in effect,
a museum, a library, a gallery of art, laboratories, lectures, and pro-
vides for such other methods as might further the promotion of
knowledge, these having later been construed to include publica-
tions, explorations, researches on the part of the staff of the Institu-
tion, and aids to research by supplying apparatus and making grants
to investigators elsewhere. The Smithson bequest, with accumulated
interest, now amounts to $650,000, to which has been added gifts and
bequests, notably those of Thomas G. Hodgkins, of $215,918.69, mak-
ing the total Smithsonian fund in the United States Treasury at the
present time $944,918.69. Upon this fund, and up to $1,000,000, the
United States has agreed to pay in perpetuity interest at the rate of
§ per cent per annum. Other investments bring the capital of the
Institution up to about $1,000,000. All of the operations of the
Institution proper must be carried on with the income of this very
limited fund.

The Institution is by law an Establishment composed of the Presi-
dent of the United States, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and
the heads of the Executive Departments. It is governed by a Board
of Regents, consisting of the Vice-President and Chief Justice, ex
officio, three members of the Senate, appointed by the President of
the Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, appointed
by the Speaker of the House, and six citizens of the United States,
appointed by act of Congress, two of whom are residents of the city of
Washington and four of States of the Union, but no two of the same
State. The Secretary of the Establishment and of the Board of Re-
gents is the Secretary of the Institution and director of its activities.

98 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Regents have usually been selected from among the most distin-
guished Members of Congress and the citizen Regents from among
the presidents of great universities or eminent public men.

The Institution has-had four Secretaries: Joseph Henry, 1846 to
1878, physicist and discoverer of the electro-magnet; Spencer Fuller-
ton Baird, 1878 to 1887, naturalist and founder of the United States
Fish Commission; Samuel Pierpont Langley, 1887 to 1906, astron-
omer and astrophysicist and discoverer of the laws of mechanical
flight, which he successfully demonstrated; and Charles Doolittle
Walcott, elected 1907, paleontologist and geologist.

The activities of the Institution fall under the following heads:
(1) The Institution proper; (2) the National Museum; (3) the Inter-
national Exchanges; (4) the Bureau of American Ethnology; (5)
the National Zoological Park; (6) the Astrophysical Observatory.

The Institution has aided numerous investigators with advice,
direction, and money, supplying books, apparatus, and laboratory
accommodations. It has also conducted series of public lectures,
which have afterwards been published. It undertook the collection
of meteorological data for weather forecasting and prepared the
first daily weather map ever issued in the world. Its work in this
field, after being brought beyond the experimental stage, was trans-
ferred to the Signal Service of the United States Army, and after-
wards resulted in the establishment of the United States Weather
Bureau. It likewise undertook the initial investigations on the food-
fishes of the country, which resulted in the establishment of the
United States Fish Commission, now the Bureau of Fisheries.

Publications of great value have been issued in the following
series :

Annual reports, 1846 to 1905, containing numerous papers of gen-
eral interest intended to keep the ordinary reader abreast of the
progress of science.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, of which 32 volumes
have appeared, the distinguishing feature of which is that each
memoir constitutes an original contribution to knowledge.

Miscellaneous Collections, of which 48 volumes have been printed.
These contain bibliographies, reports of expeditions, standard tables,
and minor scientific papers. Since 1902 some of the papers of this
series have been issued in the form of a scientific Quarterly.

Under the Hodgkins foundation, a portion of which was intended
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge in regard to atmospheric
air and its relation to the welfare of man, numerous investigations
have been undertaken and medals and prizes awarded, the most
notable being a prize of $10,000 to Lord Rayleigh and Sir William
Ramsay for their discovery of the element “Argon” in the
atmosphere.
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 99

One of the important features of the Institution is the library,
numbering over 250,000 volumes, consisting mainly of transactions of
learned societies and scientific periodicals, secured initially by pur-
chase, but now regularly added to by way of exchanges with numer-
ous universities and other institutions at home and abroad. Since
1866 the main portion of this library has been deposited in the
Library of Congress, thus enriching the national collections. A small
working library has been brought together in the Institution. Li-
brary methods and scientific bibliography have been greatly furthered
by the Institution, and many valuable lists and bibliographies and
rules for cataloguing have been published. Since 1901 the Institu-
tion has acted on the part of the United States as one of the com-
ponent bureaus of an International Catalogue of Scientific Literature,
with headquarters at London, which prepares and issues annual
volumes of indexes to the literature of natural and physical sciences.

The Institution has for a number of years supported a table in the
biological station at Naples, to which qualified investigators are
admitted free of cost to them.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Smithsonian Institution is the custodian, and the only lawful
place of deposit,of all objects of art and of foreign and curious research,
and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and min-
eralogical specimens belonging to the United States. These collec-
tions are popularly known as the National Museum. The history of
the Museum is divided into three periods, first, from the foundation
of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, during which time specimens
were collected solely to serve as materials for research; second, from
1857 (when the Institution assumed the custody of the “ National
Cabinet of Curiosities ”) to 1876, during which period the Museum
became the place of deposit for scientific material which had already
been studied by investigators and had become available for public
exhibition and educational purposes. In 1876 the Museum entered
upon a new career of activity as a result of the large collections
secured by the Government and the Institution after the close of
the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, and Congress provided
a new building, which was erected upon the Smithsonian grounds
and opened to the public in 1881. In 1903 an additional building,
at a cost of $3,500,000, was provided for and is now in course of
erection.

The collections of the Museum are especially rich in the natural
history, geology, paleontology, archeology, and ethnology of America,
and also include many other subjects, such as American history,
ethnography, and collections relating to fine art and the industrial
100 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

arts. The Museum is both an educational and research institution,
the exhibition series being specially well arranged and labeled from
an educational point of view, while the study series form the working
basis for numerous investigations both on the part of the Museum
staff and by many scientific men in the United States and abroad.
In furtherance of its work, the Museum has issued numerous reports,
bulletins, and proceedings, which contain many valuable reports of
research as well as contributions to knowledge.

Gallery of art—One of the fundamental objects prescribed by the
act of Congress founding the Institution was the establishment of
a Gallery of Art, a portion of the Smithsonian building being espe-
cially designed for this purpose. The building itself is a fine exam-
ple of architectual art during the latter half of the twelfth century,
variously styled Norman, Romanesque, or Lombard, and its erection
was made possible by funds accumulated as interest on the Smithson
bequest. In 1849 a very valuable collection of etchings and engrav-
ings belonging to George P. Marsh was purchased and a gallery was
maintained until 1865, when the prints and engravings were depos-
ited in the Library of Congress, and later the other art collections
were deposited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art. These, however,
were in the main recalled from both places in 1896 and reexhibited
at the Institution. In 1906 Charles L. Freer conveyed to the Insti-
tution his valuable art collections, including many paintings by
Whistler and four other American artists, numerous etchings and
engravings by Whistler, and many examples of Chinese and Japanese
art, as well as a large collection of oriental pottery. In the same
year, as the result of a judicial decision, the Institution was declared
in law and in fact to be the National Gallery of Art, thereby secur-
ing the small but choice art collection of Harriet Lane Johnston,
including examples of the greatest English portrait painters, and a
number of historical objects.

In March, 1907, the National Gallery was further enriched by the
gift of Mr. William T. Evans, of Montclair, N. J., who presented
to it 50 paintings representing the best of the work of American
artists. These paintings are now on exhibition in the large atrium
of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, through the courtesy of its directors,
until a suitable place shall be provided for them in the Smithsonian
Institution.

The Museum was under the direct charge of Spencer F. Baird,
as Assistant Secretary of the Institution, from 1850 to 1878, when
he became Secretary, and he was largely aided in its management
by George Brown Goode, who served as Assistant Secretary in charge
of the Museum from 1887 to 1896. He was succeeded by Charles
D. Walcott, 1896 to 1898, and by Richard Rathbun, 1898 to date.

THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

A system of International Exchanges was begun in 1850 for the
free interchange of scientific publications between institutions and
investigators in the United States and those in foreign lands. In 1867
Congress assigned to the Institution the duty of exchanging 50 copies
of all public documents of this country for similar documents of for-
eign nations, and this number was in 1901 increased to 100 sets at the
option of the Librarian of Congress. In 1889 a definite treaty, made
previously at a convention at Brussels, was formally proclaimed
by the President of the United States, wherein the United States
Government with a number of others undertook the continuation
of the exchange service on a more extensive basis. Out of this has
grown the Bureau of International Exchanges, for the maintenance
of which Congress provides by annual appropriation. The total
number of correspondents benefited by this service is 56,314, and
from 1850 to .1906, 2,748,852 packages were handled by it. The
Exchange service is in charge of an Assistant Secretary, Cyrus Adler.

THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The Bureau of American Ethnology is an outgrowth of researches
beginning early in the history of the Institution, which has, from
the outset, devoted much attention to the study of the tribes of
American Indians. It took its present form through Congressional
appropriation in 1879, and has collected a large amount of data
relating to the habits and customs, the laws, the religions, the lan-
guages, and the physical characteristics of the aborigines of this
continent. It has published 25 reports and 31 bulletins, and has
a great amount of unpublished material, including hundreds of
vocabularies. Besides doing a considerable amount of archeological
work, it has made important additions to knowledge, and also
invaluable collections. The Director of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, from its inception to 1902, was Maj. J. W. Powell, who
has been succeeded as chief by W. H. Holmes.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The Astrophysical Observatory was established in 1890 and has
been under the immediate direction of Mr. S. P. Langley, who here
continued researches previously begun at the Allegheny Observatory.
These investigations of solar radiations made possible by Mr. Lang-
ley’s invention of the bolometer, have resulted in the production of a
complete map by an automatic and absolutely trustworthy process
which shows at the unknown region or invisible spectrum the lines
102 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

that resemble the so-called Fraunhofer lines in the upper spectrum.
The study has been especially directed to that region of the spectrum
which includes the greater portion of all those energies of the sun
which affects, through its heat, the climate and the crop. Its present
director is C. G. Abbot.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The National Zoological Park was establishea by Congress in 1890
for the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of
the people, and incidentally to secure the preservation of such Amer-
ican animals as were upon the verge of extinction. The park is sit-
uated on Rock Creek, 2 miles north of the center of Washington, and
has an area of 167 acres. It is amply supplied with water, and its
surface is of a varied and picturesque character. The collections
comprise about 1400 animals. The park is in charge of a superin-
tendent, Frank Baker.
MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER-

By MaApAME Curikz, Chargé de cours @ la Sorbonne.d

When one reviews the progress made in the department of physics
within the last ten years, he is struck by the change which has taken
place in the fundamental ideas concerning the nature of electricity
and matter. The change has been brought about in part by researches
on the electric conductivity of gas, and in part by the discovery and
study of the phenomena of radioactivity. It is, I believe, far from
being finished, and we may well be sanguine of future developments.
One point which appears to-day to be definitely settled is a view of
atomic structure of electricity, which goes to confirm and complete
the idea that we have long held regarding the atomic structure of
matter, which constitutes the basis of chemical theories.

At the same time that the existence of electric atoms, indivisible by
cur present means of research, appears to be established with cer-
tainty, the important properties of these atoms are also shown. The
atoms of negative electricity which we call electrons, are found to
exist in a free state, independent of all material atoms, and not hay-
ing any properties in common with them. In this state they possess
certain dimensions in space, and are endowed with a certain inertia,
which has suggested the idea of attributing to them a corresponding
mass.

Experiments have shown that their dimensions are very small com-
pared with those of material molecules, and that their mass is only
a small fraction, not exceeding one one-thousandth of the mass of an
atom of hydrogen. They show also that if these atoms can exist
isolated, they may also exist in all ordinary matter, and may be in
certain cases emitted by a substance such as a metal without its
properties being changed in a manner appreciable by us.

If, then, we consider the electrons as a form of matter, we are led

104 MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER.

to put the division of them beyond atoms and to admit the existence
of a kind of extremely small particles, able to enter into the com-
position of atoms, but not necessarily by their departure involving
atomic destruction. Looking at it in this hght, we are led to con-
sider every atom as a complicated structure, and this supposition is
rendered probable by the complexity of the emission spectra which
characterize the different atoms. We have thus a conception suffi-
ciently exact of the atoms of negative electricity.

It is not the same for positive electricity, for a great dissimilarity
appears to exist between the two electricities. Positive electricity
appears always to be found in connection with material atoms, and
we have no reason, thus far, to believe that they can be separated.
Our knowledge relative to matter is also increased by an important
fact. A new property of matter has been discovered which has re-
ceived the name of radioactivity. Radioactivity is the property which
the atoms of certain substances possess of shooting off particles, some
of which have a mass comparable to that of the atoms themselves,
while the others are the electrons. This property, which uranium and
thorium possess in a slight degree, has led to the discovery of a new
chemical element, radium, whose radioactivity is very great. Among
the particles expelled by radium are some which are ejected with
great velocity, and their expulsion is accompanied with a consider-
able evolution of heat. A radioactive bodv constitutes then, a source
of energy.

According to the theory which best accounts for the phenomena
of radioactivity, a certain proportion of the atoms of a radioactive
body is transformed in a given time, with the production of atoms
of less atomic weight, and in some cases with the expulsion of elec-
trons. This is a theory of the transmutation of elements, but differs
from the dreams of the alchemists in that we declare ourselves, for
the present at least, unable to induce or influence the transmutation.
Certain facts go to show that radioactivity appertains in a slight
degree to all kinds of matter. It may be, therefore, that matter is
far from being as unchangeable or inert as it was formerly thought;
and is, on the contrary, in continual transformation, although this
transformation escapes our notice by its relative slowness.

In the beginning of the last century Coulomb and Ampere
regarded each of the two kinds of electricity to be a fluid under the
influence of central forces—repulsion existing between particles of
the same fluid and attraction between particles of different fluids.
Such forces would be proportional in the electric charge of the par-
ticles, and would vary in inverse ratio to the square of the distance
between them. Starting with these hypotheses, and explaining
suitably the observed facts relative to the different nature of con-
ductors and dielectrics, they constructed a very perfect theory of
MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER. 105

electrostatic phenomena. An analogous theory for magnetism may
be built up by assuming that the law of action between two mag-_
netic poles is absolutely hke the law of action between electrified
particles. The electric current was regarded as the flowing of an
electric fluid in a conductor. To establish a theory of electro-mag-
netics and electro-dynamic phenomena, it is necessary to bring in a
third law of action-at-a-distance between the magnetic poles and
the electric-current law of Laplace. All these theories in their
entirety are founded on the laws of forces acting at a distance, in com-
bination with the conception of electric fluids.

Faraday, although contemporaneous with this development, looked
at the question from a different point of view. He did not believe
in the possibility or power of action-at-a-distance between electrified
bodies, and thought that the forces which were exercised between
them resulted from elastic tensions which established themselves in
the intervening medium. These elastic forces comprise a tension in
the direction of the lines of force and a pressure at right angles to
them. In seeking to show the direct influence of the medium he was
led to the discovery of the inductive power of dielectrics, and his
belief in the essential part played by the intervening medium was
thus strengthened. According to Faraday, the surface of charged
conductors are to be regarded as surfaces of separation between
regions where an electric field exists and fields of zero intensity.

He was struck by the barrenness of the efforts that had been made
to realize an absolute charge, and electric charges always appeared to
him as the ends of tubes of force which traverse the dielectric.

Maxwell, captivated by the ideas of Faraday, endeavored to ex-
plain them in mathematical language. He demonstrated that there
does not exist in a mathematical view any incompatibility between
theories based upon laws of action-at-a-distance and Faraday’s theory
of continuous action; and that by assigning a reasonable value to
the tensions and pressures which Faraday conceived to exist in the
dielectric, an electrostatic theory could be constructed identical to
that which is derived from the law of action-at-a-distance. While
Maxwell does not specify precisely the nature of electricity, he
treats of it generally as a fluid whose displacement in a conductor
gives rise to a resistance proportional to the velocity of the flow,
while its displacement in a dielectric produces an elastic reaction. In
a dielectric, displacement can only occur at the time when the field
changes. One of the essential ideas of Maxwell was to consider the
displacement of electricity in the dielectric as an electric current to
which he gives the name of “ currents of displacement.” Currents of
displacement, according to Maxwell, behave like ordinary currents, in
the sense that they produce magnetic fields. Every open circuit in a
conductor, following the opinion of Maxwell, is completed by a cur-
106 MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER.

rent of displacement in the dielectric, so that there exist only closed
_circuits.

The system of the six differential equations, called Maxwell’s
equations, brings out in mathematical form the relation which exists
at each point of an electro-magnetic field between the current of
displacement and the magnetic field, as well as between the rate of
change of the magnetic induction and the resulting electric field.
These perfectly symmetrical relations show that all variations of
an electric field cause a magnetic field, and vice versa. Starting
from these equations, Maxwell proved that every perturbation of an
electro-magnetic field should be propagated in a vacuum, with a
velocity equal to that of light in a vacuum, and he draws the conclu-
sion that the medium which transmits electro-magnetic actions in
the vacuum is the same as that which transmits light, and that light is
very likely an electro-magnetic phenomenon. This conception has
served as the basis of the electro-magnetic theory of light, now uni-
versally adopted as the result of the experiments of Hertz and
numerous physicists upon electro-magnetic waves. In the develop-
ment of the ideas of Faraday and Maxwell, a preponderating
influence was attributed to the role of the dielectric medium, so that
little attention was paid for some time to the nature of electricity;
and this question was relegated to a subordinate place, and received
only an indirect interpretation. There was no longer the conception
of charges of electricity localized in a determined region, nor of a
fluid flowing through a conductor. The main conceptions were of
energy localized in the dielectric medium and the differential equa-
tions which determine the field in the medium. Recent progress in
research has brought us back to a more concrete conception of the
nature of electricity.

The first impulse in this direction was the result of investigations
of electrolysis and modern theories of this phenomenon. It was
established with certainty that the passage of electricity in the elec-
trolyte is always accompanied by the transportation of matter. Elec-
trolytes are aqueous solutions of acids, bases, and mineral salts, or
these bodies in a fused condition. It is now admitted that the mole-
cules of a dissolved substance are totally or partially dissociated
in two ions—one ion formed by the metal, or hydrogen, and charged
positively; another formed by the acid radical, and charged nega-
tively. When there is set up in the solution an electric field the ions
move toward the electrodes of contrary sign, transporting across the
liquid their charges, which they give up to the electrodes, and
themselves become free in a neutral state. Tons are, then, the actual
carriers of electricity in electrolytes, and the current is a current of
convection. It follows from Faraday’s laws that all monovalent
ions carry the same amount of charge, q, corresponding to 96,600
Land

MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER. 10%

coulombs per gram of ions, while an ion of valence, n, carries a charge
nq. There can not be conceived in electrolysis an isolated charge of
electricity less than that carried by a monovalent atom, such, for
example, as hydrogen in the ionic state. The atomic structure of
electricity is therefore an immediate and necessary consequence of the
atomic structure of matter.

It is by no means evident, a priori, that this conception can be gen-
eralized and that the other known cases of conduction are susceptible
of an analogous interpretation; but this seems to be coming to pass.
The study of the electrical conductivity of gases has borrowed from
the theory of electrolysis the idea of charged ions, vehicles of the
current; and the phenomena are satisfactorily accounted for by the
hypothesis that the current in a gas is a current of convection. But
the vehicles of the current are not here the same as in an electrolyte.
It is believed that an ionized gas gives rise to two ions, of which one
is that minute thing which we call an electron, the other being the
remainder of the molecule deprived of the electron. By ingenious
methods the number of ions present in a given volume of gas has
been counted and the charge carried by each one determined. This
charge is equal to that transported by an atom of hydrogen in elec-
trolysis, and thus we find this presented to us the second time as the
smallest quantity of electricity which can be isolated.

All the phenomena of conduction across a gas under the influence of
different forms of radiation or in the disruptive discharge at varying
tension appear to be susceptible to explanation by the theory of the
ionization of gases.

Attempts have been made to explain the conduction of metals in a
similar way, and it is probable that this also may be considered as a
current of convection whose vehicles are the electrons set free in the
metal. Thus we arrive at the conclusion that electric currents through
all forms of matter are currents of convection, or, in other words, the
displacements of electric charges. Besides this it has been proved
that any such displacement gives rise to a magnetic field.

The conception of the existence of atoms of electricity which is thus
brought before us in the phenomena of conduction plays an essen-
tial part in modern theories of electricity like that of Lorentz. This
theory retains the fundamental idea of Faraday and Maxwell, ac-
cording to which the electromagnetic actions are always transmitted
from place to place in a continuous medium with a finite velocity.
This medium is the ether of space, and the velocity is the velocity
of hight. The laws of variation of an electromagnetic field in the
ether are expressed at each point by the equations of Maxwell, and
the causes which produce the electromagnetic field are sought in the
existence of positive and negative atoms of electricity and in the
motions of these atoms. We are thus returning to a conception which
108 MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER.

recalls the old idea of two electrical fiuids, only that we distinguish
clearly the atomic structure of these fluids, and we understand bet-
ter the relations which exist between the atoms of electricity and
matter, a relation which is the most important aspect of the problem.

An atom of electricity in motion produces around itself an electro-
magnetic field which accompanies the movement of the particle, and
which represents a certain quantity of energy whose amount is
greater the higher the velocity of the charged projectile. It is not
possible to increase this velocity without the expenditure of energy,
and in consequence the charged projectile is endowed with a certain
inertia. In mechanics inertia is used as a measure of the mass, and we
may say that the atom of electricity possesses mass on account of its
charge. Computation shows that the mass depends upon the velocity.
It remains constant when the velocity of the projectile is small (about
one one-hundredth the velocity of light), but for increasing velocities
it augments very rapidly and tends toward an infinite value when the
velocity approaches that of light, so that this is a limiting velocity
which can not be realized.

It may be imagined that a group of atoms of electricity, both posi-
tive and negative, whose total charge is zero, possesses, nevertheless,
inertia in consequence of the constituent electrical charges. This
group might serve as a model of a material atom. Thus may be
proposed a more general form of mechanics than that customarily
considered, which is based on the constancy of mass. The latter
would be no more than a first approximation to the truth, and holds
good only for cases of motion where the velocity is not extremely
great. Preliminary attempts have been made to explain universal
gravitation between atoms constituted as above proposed. <Alto-
gether these studies tend toward an intimate fusion of the idea of
electricity and the idea of matter, so that these two conceptions may
vet be actually identified.

This proposed constitution of the atoms serves as an excellent
foundation for a theory of the emission of ght or radiation by ¢
body. Such emission may be regarded as consisting of electro-mag-
netic waves of short period, emitted by an atom whose constituent
ions are in a state of vibration. The same atomic structure serves
also very well in the case of radioactive atoms. These atoms are in
fact emitting corpuscles, some of which are electrons, others positively
charged particles having a size comparable with that of atoms.

But we will not now penetrate further the domain of these theories,
but turn rather to examine some of the phenomena which have served
as a foundation for their development. It is well known that gases
in their ordinary state, when exposed to a weak electrical field, have
so insignificant a conductibility that they are regarded as remarkably
good insulators. But it is not the same when the gases are under
MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER. 109

the influence of certain exterior conditions, as, for example, the
Roentgen rays, for in such conditions a gas becomes conducting. A
charged electroscope in connection with a metallic plate in ordimary
circumstances loses its charge but slowly. If, however, a stream of
Roentgen rays penetrates the air around the plate, the discharge
proceeds rapidly. It is not necessary for the Roentgen rays actually
to strike the plate, but suffices that the air be traversed within a dis-
tance where the electric field is still sensible. This is shown by con-
straining the Roentgen rays to follow a tube impenetrable to them,
end thus shielding the plate from their path, so that it is certainly the
gas which is modified and rendered conducting. We say that the
gas is lonized, some of its molecules having been decomposed by the
rays, and that each of these has given rise to the formation of two
ions laden with equal electric charges having opposite signs. The
ions are put in motion under the influence of the electric field with a
velocity which increases with the strength of the field. If the elec-
troscope is charged positively, the negative ions are drawn toward
and discharge it, while the positive ions go in the opposite direction
and neutralize the charge found at the extremities of the lines of force
which emanate from the plate.

If the gas which has been under the influence of the rays is left
to itself without the action of any electric field to move the ions, its
conductivity disappears spontaneously, and we say that the ions
have recombined to form neutral molecules.

There appear to be in the gas movable charged centers, which travel
toward the plate of the electroscope. These centers may be inter-
cepted by means of a screen of paraffin. The screen should not
itself be charged, as may be tested by means of a second electroscope.
The positively charged plate of the first electroscope may now be
covered with the screen, and the Roentgen rays then allowed to act
for a time. Negative ions moving toward the charged plate are
arrested by the paraffin, and they charge the screen negatively.
This may be verified by again bringing the paraffin screen near the
second electroscope. .

It may be shown that under the action of the Roentgen rays the
number of ions produced in a gas in a given time is definitely limited.

The rate of discharge of the electroscope is measured by the rate of
fall of the gold leaves; and it increases with the electric intensity of
the charge, as may be easily understood. Therefore, the stronger the
electric field and the greater the velocity the less is the chance that the
opposite ions draw together. But for a charge sufficiently great, the
rate of the discharge no longer depends on the amount of the charge
and does not increase as it augments. Under these circumstances there
are no longer any recombinations of ions; they are all utilized for
conducting the current, which can not exceed what they can carry.
110 MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER.

Such a current is called a current of saturation. It is constant for a
given intensity of radiation independent of the sign of the electric
charge.

An important difference shows itself between the properties of posi-
tive and negative ions. This difference is easily shown by the gases
of flames. These gases are ions and conductors, and the approach of
flame promotes the electric discharge. Contact with the flame is not
necessary. It is sufficient that the ions are produced within the region
covered by the electric field. The attraction of the charge of the
electroscope suffices to draw from the flame the ions of contrary sign,
which neutralize it, and this phenomenon takes place, whatever the
sion of the charge. But an isolated flame placed between the two
plates of a charged condenser inclines toward the negative field;
hence we conclude that the flame is then charged positively. This
is because the negative ions produced in the flame are smaller and by
far more active than the positive ions, so that they are more easily
drawn from the flame, and thus there is left with it an excess of posi-
tive electricity. In a cold gas the positive and negative ions have a
nearly equal mobility, which is less than that found in a warm gas.
They are thought to be in this case formed by the agglomeration of
molecules grouped by electrostatic attraction about the charged
centers. The dissimilarity between positive and negative ions mani-
fests itself in certain cases even in their formation. This is shown, for
example, in what is called the phenomenon of Hertz: Certain nega-
tively charged metals, such as zine, lose their charge when illuminated
by ultraviolet hght, but if the charge is positive the illumination pro-
duces no discharge. It seems to be proved now that zine and some
other easily oxidizable metals has the property of spontaneously giving
off electrons under the action of ultraviolet rays. If the emission is
given off in a vacuum the electrons are able to acquire a very high
velocity in an electric field, and they comport themselves then lke
the cathode rays of Crookes tubes. If the emission takes place in
the air at ordinary pressure the electrons surround themselves with
agglomerations of neutral molecules, and form ions of little activity,
like those ions which are formed in the air by the Roentgen rays. But
in either case the discharge is nonreversible and takes place only if the
metal is negatively charged, for the metal is not able to emit negative
electrons if the departure of them is obstructed by the attraction of a
positive charge residing upon the metal.

Thus we see why it is that gases may become conductors under the
influence of certain radiations, or of the combustion of flames. It
has been known for a long time, however, that without any of these
influences a gas can not prevent the passage of electricity when the
field is sufficiently strong. The phenomena of the disruptive dis-
charge, including the spark, the arc, and the brush discharges, have
MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER. i

long been known, and they take various and complicated forms in
the air at different pressures; but until recently they have been very
little understood. The theory of gaseous ions has thrown a new light
upon this manner of discharge. As a result of recent researches, the
disruptive discharges can be explained by assuming that the ions
which have acquired a sufficient velocity under the action of an elec-
tric field are able to act as projectiles, which, coming in contact with
the molecules of gas, ionize them by the shock which they produce.
Negative ions are much more active ionizing agents than the posi-
tive ions, and can produce these effects in more feeble fields. It may
be conceived, then, that the ions being multiphed by the shock of
those already present, the conductibility of the gas becomes very
great when the field is sufficiently strong, and the ionized gas is then
luminous.

The cathode rays, which are produced when the discharge is made
to pass in a tube containing a gas under low pressure, are the elec-
trons sent off by the cathode with a great velocity. Since these elec-
trons and the positive ions have different properties, the discharge
tube takes on the well-known dys-symmetrical appearance, which the
theory of the ions readily explains, but for which no other interpre-
tation has sufficed.

The Roentgen rays, which are emitted from a Crookes tube, are
believed to be in reality electromagnetic waves whose wave length
is very short. Such waves as these are supposed to be emitted by an
electron whenever it is subjected to an abrupt acceleration, such as
is produced, for example, when the electrons of a metal are put in
vibration by the impact of cathode rays.

Tn accordance with what has been said, all gases which show them-
selves conducting contain the charged centers which we call gaseous
ions. The presence of these charged centers may be made evident
by means of a very curious experiment, which utilizes the property
which ions have of promoting the condensation of supersaturated
water vapor. When the volume of a certain mass of saturated water
vapor is quickly increased the vapor condenses to the extent to which
it is supersaturated, but if the supersaturation is not very great, and if
the vessel contains no dust, there is no noticeable condensation at the
moment of change, and the gas remains transparent; but when the
gas contains ions the condensation takes place readily—that is to
say, with a smaller expansion. It is easy to regulate the expansion
so that there will be no condensation when the gas is not ionized but
an abundant condensation if ionized. In the latter case the con-
densation manifests itself by the formation of an opaque cloud which
fills the receptacle. Investigation of this phenomenon has shown
that the globules of water, which constitute the cloud, form them-
selves upon the ions, each of which serves as a center for one of them.
112 MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER.

Ingenious experiments have made it possible to count the globules
present in a cubic centimeter of cloud and thus to obtain the number
of ions present in this volume. By measuring, in addition, the total
charge of the ions of each sign in a cubic centimeter the individual
charge of the ions is determined—that is to say, the charge of a single
atom of electricity. This charge is equal to 3.4 times 10-'° electro-
static units. In order to show this phenomenon the gas may be
ionized by the introduction of a glowing platinum wire, and it will
be recognized that there is an energetic ionization of the gas sur-
rounding the incandescent body.

We will now pass to the essential facts revealed by the study of
‘adio-active substances, and examine them from the point of view of
the hypothesis of the atomic transformation of matter. Among
the radioactive elements, some appear to be permanently active
(uranium, thorium, radium, actinium) while others lose their radio-
activity little by little (polonium). The most powerful representa-
tive of the permanently radioactive substances is radium. Accord-
ing to the theory of transformation this substance changes very
slowly, so that a given mass of radium would lose half its weight
only in several thousand years. Consequently the quantity of radium
which disappears from a gram of this substance in an hour 1s
absolutely inaccessible to experiments. However, a gram of radium
disengages each hour about 100 calories of heat. To conceive how
enormous this disengagement of heat is, we remark that during the
life attributable to radium the complete transformation of a gram of
this substance would produce as much heat as the combustion of a
ton of coal. The transformation of radium, then, if transformation
there be, is not to be regarded as an ordinary chemical reaction, for
the quantity of heat involved is of a far higher order. One is led to
conceive, rather, that the atoms themselves are transformed, for the
quantities of energy put in play in the formation of atoms are
probably considerable.

Indeed, the phenomena of radioactivity has a palpably atomic
character which was brought to ight in the beginning of researches
on the subject. It was precisely the absolute conviction that we were
dealing with an atomic phenomenon which led M. Curie and me to
the discovery of radium. If the radioactivity can not be separated
from the atom it is very difficult to conceive anything but the atom
itself involved in the transformation.

The effects produced by radium are very powerful considering
how small is the quantity of this substance at disposal for experi-
ments. There is a spontaneous and continuous emission of rays,
analogous to those which we know are produced by means of an
induction coil in a Crookes tube, and these rays produce ionization
of gas in the same manner. They are able, for example, to produce
MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER. Takes}

the rapid discharge of an electroscope. The energy of the rays is
so great that the discharge is produced even across a thick metallic
screen, for the rays can traverse such a screen.

Some of the rays comprise electrified particles moving with very
great velocity. Some are charged positively, and their dimensions
are comparable with those of atoms; while others are negative elec-
trons, whose electric charge may be shown by direct experiments.
Admitting that all these projectiles come from the atoms of radium
themselves, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the departure
of a positive particle must necessarily cause a modification of the
-atom which expels it.

Among the electrons emitted there are some whose velocity is enor-
mous, and is in fact no less than nine-tenths the velocity of light.
It has been found that the mass of these projectiles (which are the
most rapid that we know of) is greater than that of slower-moving
electrons, and this result may be considered as a confirmation of the
theory according to which the mass of an electron is regarded as the
result of electro-magnetic phenomena.

The energy of the rays of radium is also manifested by their capacity
for exciting the luminosity of various phosphorescent substances.
Radium salts are, indeed, themselves luminous, and the light is
readily visible in certain conditions.

Here are now a new series of facts which are interpreted by the
theory of radio-active transformation. Radium disengages continu-
ously a substance which behaves like a gaseous radio-active material,
and which has received the name of the emanation. Air which has
been in contact with a solution of radium salts is charged with the
emanation, and may be drawn away and studied. Air containing the
emanation is strongly conducting. A sealed glass tube in which the
emanation has been imprisoned acts on the outside like a radioactive
substance, and is able, for example, to discharge an electroscope.
When the emanation is drawn into a flask containing zine sulphide,
the latter becomes luminous. The emanation is an unstable gas and
spontaneously disappears, even from a sealed glass tube, at a rate in
accord with a strict law, by which a given quantity of emanation
diminishes by half in about four days. The emanation possesses
the property of imparting radioactivity to all the bodies in contact
with it, and such bodies are said to possess induced radio-activity.
Here is a tube of glass which did contain emanation, but contains
it no longer, for it has been purged by a current of air; nevertheless
this tube continues to act as a radioactive body, and is able to dis-
charge an electroscope. But this induced radioactivity is even less
durable than the emanation; it disappears spontaneously and dimin-
ishes by half in a half hour.

sm 1906——8
iitzt MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER.

In the theory of atomic transformation the emanation of radium
is the first product of disintegration and is transformed in its turn.
The induced radioactivity to which it gives rise is considered as due
to a solid radioactive material, which results from the transformation
of the radium emanation. Three different radioactive materials are
distinguished in the induced radioactivity, which constitute three
successive terms of the transformation. Each transformation 1s also
accompanied by the emission of rays, and the expelled particles are
also counted among the resulting products.

Induced radioactivity does not disappear completely; but there
remains after the lapse of a day a very feeble residue which persists.
in part for years, and which is believed to be adding new terms to the
series of successive transformations.

A new fact of great interest has come to the support of the theory
of the transmutation of radioactive substances, and has, indeed, made
it almost indispensable. It has been proved that radium, a per-
fectly definite chemical element, produces continually another per-
fectly definite chemical element, helium (Ramsay and .Soddy). It
is admitted that helium is one of the products of the disintegration
of the atom of radium, and it is noteworthy that helium occurs in
all the radium-bearing minerals.

The theory of the radioactive transformation has been extended
to all the radioactive bodies, and investigations have been made to
determine if the radioactive substances heretofore considered as ele-
ments are not to be derived from one another. The origin of radium
itself has been sought in uranium. It is well known that radium is
found in the uranium-bearing minerals, and it appears from recent
researches that the proportion between the quantities of radium and
uranium is the same in all these minerals. Uranium may, then, be
thought of as a mother substance, which disintegrates with extreme
slowness, giving place to the production of radium and the products
which succeed it. It appears also to be probable that the last term
of the radioactive series is polonium. It may be recalled that ura-
nium was the substance in which the property of radioactivity was
discovered by M. Becquerel, and polonium is the first new substance
which was discovered by the aid of the phenomenon of radioactivity.

A series of analogous considerations has been established for an-
other radioactive substance—thorium. In this case thorium as a
primary substance generates radio-thorium, a substance recently dis-
covered, which gives rise to the gaseous radioactive emanation of
thorium and various products of radioactivity induced by this emana-
tion. Actinium also gives place to a series of transformations simi-
lar to those of thorium, and it, like radium, produces helium.

All the radioactive substances which have been studied sufficiently
from the point of view of their disintegration follow a law of decreas-
MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRICITY AND MATTER. 15

ing progression, characterized by a constant coefficient. This coeffi-
cient may be defined as the time required for the diminution of the
activity by half. These constants appear to be independent of the
conditions of experiment, are characteristic of the substance to which
they appertain, and seem to be capable of fixing an absolute scale of
time. Thus the emanation of radium diminishes by half in about
four days, while that of thorium diminishes by half in about one
minute, and that of actinium in about four seconds.

I have already stated that the radioactivity is a general property of
matter. If the theory of radioactive transformation continues to
inspire a growing degree of confidence, it will result in an important
consequence for geology, and will lead to a careful study of the pro-
portions of the elements occurring in rocks, with a view to deduce
their relative ages.

It is plain that the hypothesis of radioactive transformation is
well adapted to the present state of the science of radioactivity.
It was among those proposed by M. Curie and myself at the begin-
ning of our researches on radioactivity;® but it has received its
precise development by Rutherford and Soddy, to whom it is for
this reason generally attributed. It seems to me, however, better
not to leave the domain of demonstrated facts, and not to lose sight
of other explanations of radioactivity which have been proposed.
The actual state of the science does not seem to me far enough
advanced to warrant a positive conclusion.

In closing, the general importance of the phenomena of radio-
activity may be recalled. For physics the radioactive substances
constitute a new implement of research in consequence of the rays
they emit, and they have actively contributed to the development
of the theory of the conduction of gas and of the nature of the
electron. By their numerous chemical and physiological effects,
and their possible influence on meteorology, these substances extend
their sphere of action in the domain of all the science of nature; and
it is probable that their importance for the development of science
will go on increasing. Finally, it has been shown that there is
nothing absurd in supposing that the energy we receive from the
sun may be in part, or even in total, due to the presence of radio-
active bodies which it may contain.

RADIOACTIVITY.

By Prof. Dr. FRANZ HIMSTEDT,

Prorector of the University of Freiburg in Breisgau, Baden, Germany.

In December, 1895, R6ntgen made his first communication regard-
ing the X-rays to the physical medical society in Wiirzburg, and early
in 1896 Becquerel submitted to the Academy in Paris a treatise in
which it was authoritatively announced that he also had discovered
a species of rays not less wonderful, namely, those emitted by the
radioactive substances.

A decade only has passed since then, but a decade so fruitful in the
discovery of new facts, so radically revolutionizing opinions and
views maintained for a century and apparently unassailable, and so
suddenly hghting up for us regions hitherto shrouded in deepest
obscurity, that another like it can hardly be pointed out in the history
of physics. And since it is incumbent on me to-day, after the old
academic custom, to enter upon the office of prorector with a short
address relating to my special department of research, I feel that I
can choose no more fitting theme than radioactivity. I believe that
not only the recent phenomena in this field, but also the attempts at
their explanation and a statement of the new views which now obtaim
regarding the constitution of matter, will prove such as to arouse
interest far beyond the circle of those concerned mainly with physical
science,

Tn his first treatise on the X-rays, Rontgen drew attention to the
fact that they proceeded from those parts of the Réntgen tubes
where the glass, under the influence of the impinging cathode rays,
showed the most fluorescence. It therefore seemed possible that the
existence of these mysterious rays was in some way dependent on
previously acquired fluorescence, and many physicists tried to ascer-

tain with the well-known Balmain dyes, which become luminous
after exposure to the light, if results could be obtained resembling
those with a Rontgen tube.

Similar attempts by the French physicist, Henri Becquerel, were
crowned with success in an unexpected direction. He exposed a
uranium salt to the hght, and then placing it in a dark room on a
photographic plate covered with opaque paper he demonstrated the
action of these rays on the plate through the paper, thin sheets of
metal, etc. But the supposed and sought-for relation of the rays to
the previous fluorescence was not evident, for Becquerel obtained pre-
cisely the same results with preparations of uranium which had not
only not been previously exposed directly to the light but had pur-
posely been kept sometime in darkness and could therefore display no
stored-up luminescence. He had, however, discovered the uranium
or Becquerel rays. Prof. C. C. Schmidt, in Erlangen, afterwards
obtained similar results by experiments with thorium and its com-
pounds, and thus became the discoverer of the thorium rays.

At Becquerel’s suggestion Madame Curie undertook a systematic
investigation of all the chemical elements and established the fact
that with none of them, excepting uranium and thorium, could an
appreciable effect indicating rays be obtained with her apparatus.
On the other hand, she found that many of the minerals investigated
showed noticeable action in this direction. The fact that a few of
them, the uranium pitchblende, for example, from Joachimsthal,
Bohemia, emitted rays three or four times stronger than those of
pure uranium, and which could not therefore be announced as
uranium rays, led her to suppose that in the pitchblende itself, apart
from the uranium, there must exist a still more powerful radioactive
substance. It is a matter of record how, in this research, which
might serve as a model for such work, she and her husband, so soon
afterwards to lose his life by a deplorable accident, succeeded in
tracing this supposed substance more and more accurately, and finally
in obtaining it pure. Madame Curie thus became the discoverer of
radium, a new element possessed of wonderful, of fabulous qualities.

Besides Madame Curie no other investigator but Professor
Braunschweig, so far as I know, has yet succeeded in obtaining pure
radium. The difficulty of conducting this research will be appre-
ciated when I refer to the fact that out of a carload of pitchblende
from Joachimsthal, the most rich in radium of any material so far
known, Madame Curie secured in all but one-fourth of a gram of
radium chloride. Out of a mass of 1,000 kilograms to secure its
four-millionth part, in a substance evenly diffused through it, is a
record of chemical analysis which surpasses a hundredfold all pre-
vious work of the kind, and success in this attempt became possible
RADIOACTIVITY. 119

only because the substance sought for possessed the exceptional
quality of radioactivity.

A radium crystal emits three different types of radiation, which,
as suggested by Rutherford, one of the most successful investigators
in the domain of radioactivity, have been designated as a, B, and y
rays. The existence of these rays can not be directly perceived by
any of the senses; we are only indirectly made aware of their pres-
ence by the phosphorescence which they excite, by their action on a
photographic plate, and by the electrical conductivity which they
arouse in the atmosphere and in the gases.

When we see a radium crystal shining lke a glowworm in a
darkened room, it is because the crystal itself has been excited to
fluorescence by the rays, exactly as a R6éntgen screen or the Sidot-
blende can be made fluorescent by the same means. The sensation
of light experienced when the crystal is laid on the temple or on
the closed eye is due to the fact that every part of the eye itself, and
-especially the lens, becomes luminescent under the influence of the
radium rays.

The most important property discovered in the investigation of
radioactivity is the power of the rays to render the atmosphere and
the gases, which are generally good insulators, electrically con-
ductive. If we charge an insulated body like the ball of a gold
leaf electroscope with electricity it will be an hour or more before
we can detect any diminution of the charge by the slightest diver-
gence of the gold leaf; but if we bring a radium preparation into
the vicinity of the instrument the leaves suddenly collapse and the
electrical charge disappears almost instantly. If instead of the
electroscope we take one of our highly sensitive electrometers, we
have a mode of experiment a thousand times more sensitive to the
shghtest traces of radioactivity than any other known method of
physical and chemical analysis. This apparatus, with the helpful
aid of photography, has been of vast use in determining the direc-
tion of the a, 8, and y rays, and have thus added materially to our
knowledge of the subject.

The a rays act like positively charged bodies of the size of the

chemical atom which are projected from radium with the greatest
velocity. ‘They are so slightly penetrating that a sheet of paper is
impervious to them, and they are absorbed by a layer of air a few
centimeters thick.
_ The B rays are negatively charged bodies, which in every regard
resemble the cathode rays produced in a vacuum tube when an
electric charge is sent through it. These rays have become widely
known from the fact that the Réntgen rays originate at the point
where the cathode rays meet with an obstacle,
120 RADIOACTIVITY.

The y rays are analogous to the most penetrating X-rays, and
act on a photographic plate and Réntgen screen through a sheet of
lead 10 em. thick. Many observations indicate that the y rays
originate through the 6 rays in the same way as the Rontgen
through the cathode rays.

In radium we have not only an everlasting lamp, a fountain of
light shining day and night, but in this mysterious substance we
have also a stove which constantly radiates warmth without having
been itself heated. A gram of radium produces 100 gram-calories
every hour. A kilogram of radium would warm a room, and if we
should weigh our supply of fuel at the end of the winter we should
find it to be still a kilogram and still giving out the same amount of
warmth. An admirable way of heating, one would think, but not
cheap after all, for a kilogram of radium, if it could be procured,
would cost 100,000,000 marks, about $25,000,000. Even if one had
the money, such a mode of heating could not be adopted on account
of the noxious effect of such a quantity of radium, which if left
uncovered in a room would destroy all life there within twenty-four
hours. In spite of every precaution, investigators who have worked
with radium have suffered from abscesses and the lke, which prove
remarkably difficult to heal. If the finger is held for a few minutes
over 20 to 30 mg. of radium the skin is inflamed and peels off in
from eight to fourteen days. These experiences have given rise to
the idea that the radium rays might be used in the treatment of
malignant tumors—that is, lupus and carcinoma—but it is as yet
impossible to say whether or not these awful scourges of humanity
may be successfully treated in this way.

It is not, however, improbable that the healing power of radium
has contributed for centuries to the aid of mankind, as research has
proved that all natural springs contain radium emanations, and that
the quantity is greatest in the well-known healing, thermal springs.
This may be a mere coincidence, but the established fact that the
healing power is greater in the waters which possess the greatest
amount of radioactivity, favors the theory of cause and effect, as does
the fact that these waters when carried to a distance lose something
of their curative power and their radioactivity at the same time.
Swamp and fango earth possess a not inconsiderable quantity of
radium, which apparently indicates that the curative power of baths
of this sort is in proportion to their radioactivity.

Since all springs possess radioactivity and traces of the same prop-
erty are found in subterranean streams, we must draw the astonishing
conclusion that this remarkable element is widely distributed through-
out the interior of the earth, an element of whose existence no one had
a suspicion a decade ago, and of which up to this time we have been
able to isolate only the most infinitesimal quantities, hardly more
RADIOACTIVITY. roa

than a gram in all. When we consider also that radium constantly
produces heat, the question is forced upon us whether this store of
heat has not already played an important part in the constitution
of the earth, and whether it may not now do so. Indeed, we may
ask the still more astonishing question, whether heat production by
the means of radium may not be considered in connection with the
heat of the sun on which all life on our globe depends.

If we combine the Kant-Laplace hypothesis of the origin of our sun
system with the principle of energy, we reach the conclusion, as
Helmholtz has shown, that the existing supply of heat in the sun may
have arisen from the process of contraction, through which it was
formed in the beginning out of chaotic masses of nebule, and that
the continued radiation of heat by the sun is caused by the now
slower but still progressive contraction of the sun’s mass. It is evi-
dent that if the existent amount of radium produces such enormous
quantities of heat, we must suppose the process of contraction to have
proceeded correspondingly slower, and we may therefore assume a
much longer existence than heretofore supposed, in the past as well
as in the future, for both the sun and the earth, a conclusion which
agrees with the vast periods of geologic development established by
quite different facts and researches. Still this and similar questions
to which the discovery of radioactivity has given rise must remain in
abeyance so long as the chief problem, whence does radium derive
its emitted energy, remains unsolved. We have asserted that a crys-
tal of it constantly emits a, 8, and y rays, can diffuse noticeable quan-
tities of heat and, tested by the most exact measuring instruments,
still remain the same. How can this be reconciled with the law of
the conservation of energy, which we know all the processes of nature
obey? “The universe,” says Helmholtz, “has its limited supply
of energy, which works in it under ever-varying forms, indestruc-
tible, incapable of increase, eternal, and unchangeable like matter.”
We define physics as the science which treats of the transformation
of energy while conserving the quantity. We distinguish between
mechanical, chemical, and electrical energy, the energy of sound, of
light, of heat, and we assert that all physical processes in nature con-
sist only in the change of one kind of energy into the equivalent
quantity of another. No energy can be lost, and none can be created.
When we see, therefore, that radium is continually giving out energy,
and this fact is absolutely proved by manifold experiments, we are
compelled to ask, Whence comes this energy and from what is it
derived ?

None of the processes of nature hitherto known to us can give the
answer, and we are confronted by a perplexing alternative: The
principle of energy, which we have hitherto held to be the highest
guiding law of the natural sciences, is false, or there are natural
12g RADIOACTIVITY.

processes we so far have had no conception of and in which a mil-
lion times greater amount of energy is set free than any we have as
yet been in a position to investigate.

Some time ago a happy combination of circumstances relieved us
of this painful uncertainty. Observations in various fields—in
optics, electricity, and radioactivity—have worked together to point
out what these processes might be, and we have been fortunate enough
to observe directly such an illustration.

All the processes hitherto known to us may be described as molecu-
lar; our chemistry is a chemistry of the molecule. We have investi-
gated how the molecule may be built up out of the atom of the
chemical elements or may be disintegrated into atoms again, and we
have learned to measure the energy thus transformed. The chemical
elements and their atoms have hitherto been for us the completed,
the fixed, building stones which all science has tried in vain to trans-
form. But now we believe that we have advanced a step farther, and
are able to show that the elements are not unchangeable, the atoms
not indivisible.

It was unquestionably one of the greatest strides forward in the
domain of physics and chemistry when the fruitless speculations and
senseless experiments of the alchemist were brought to an end by the
ever-strengthening theory that the universe was built up of atoms,
of a limited number of simple, unchangeable, chemical elements.
The brilliant developments and great achievements of chemistry were
not less adapted to support this theory than the previous but always
fruitless attempts to disintegrate the chemical elements, to divide the
atom.

On the other hand, one may not now assert that the separate ele-
ments stand unrelated to each other, but must rather acknowledge
their interdependence. The most striking demonstration of this is
the periodic system of the elements formulated by Lothar Meyer and
Mindeljeff, which clearly shows that the properties of the elements
are periodic functions of their atomic weight. When observing, for
example, the group Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, elements of remarkably similar
characteristics, is it not surprising that I have the atomic weight of
each succeeding one in the column if I add 1X16 or 316 to the pre-
ceding? That this is the confirmation of a law and not a chance
play with figures is proved by the fact that Mindeljeff, because of the
gaps in his tables, prophesied that such and such elements, with cer-
tain characteristics, would be found, and they were found—gallium,
scandium, germanium—exactly as he had foretold. What is the sig-
nificance, then, of the 1x16 and the 3x16 in the above example?
Would that I could solve that, but it is beyond my power.

Every chemical element gives out, like a glowing vapor, a spectrum
in which the colors are not continuous and merged into each other
RADIOACTIVITY, jLeS:

as in the rainbow, but which in the spectral apparatus are shown as
a smaller or larger number of luminous lines characteristic of the
element in question, and separated by dark spaces between. These
lines have been divided into series, which show us that the light
emitted by an atom consists of a number of separate vibrations, which
may not, after the analogy of acoustic phenomena, be regarded as
the fundamental tone and the overtone of a vibrating body, but show
that the atom must consist of a larger number of minute bodies,
themselves vibratory. .

In the sun, where the temperature is about twice as high as the
most intense heat in our power to produce, the number of elements is
smaller than on the earth. In the stars, whose temperature, like that
of Sirius, for example, is higher than that of the sun, the number of
the elements is still smaller. Is it not reasonable, then, to suppose
that the number of elements in a heavenly body depends on its tem-
perature and that through heat the complex elements are subdivided
into simpler ones? Yes; and if I could only accomplish that through
experiment, but it is again beyond my power. All these and many
similar phenomena indicate a possible disintegration of the elements,
but they do not avail to produce the experimental proof. However,
such a thing has now become possible. ‘ Bodies which are smaller
than the atom” have been found by an exhaustive investigation of
the cathode rays, to which the most distinguished physicists of every
country have devoted their science and skill, J. J. Thomson, of Cam-
bridge, standing in the first rank among them.

We speak of the cathode rays, now so often mentioned, as of a
stream, like water, for, as before stated, they consist of a current of
the most minute particles, carrying a charge of negative electricity
and moving with the greatest swiftness. But how explain the fact
that these rays, these particles, can go through solid bodies without
harming them? Such a thing would be impossible unless the par-
ticles are so minute that substances as impenetrable as wood, or metal
even, would be to them like a coarse sieve.

At the first glance it seems against nature that anything should
pass through iron and steel plates, until we remember that it is only
a question of relative size. The elephant needs a door at least 2
meters high and 2 wide, and then perhaps goes through this great
opening less easily than most bacteria through the million times
smaller meshes of the finest hair sieve. Why not, then, picture to
ourselves forms which are a million times smaller than the smallest
bacteria? It is only the question whether or not we can prove that
such really exist. We have thus, you see, to demonstrate the dimen-
sions of a cathode ray particle. Direct measurement in this case
is still less possible than the measurement of an atom. How-
ever, through the ingenious combination of the results of several
1s RADIOACTIVITY.

researches, we are able to compare mathematically the size of such
particles with the size of an atom.

I have already referred to the fact that the cathode rays carry a
negative electric charge, and it has been demonstrated that each
particle contains a so-called elementary quantity of electricity, or the
amount that an atom of hydrogen carries through the galvanic
stream at the decomposition of water. We should therefore think
it reasonable if such a particle were of the same size as the hydrogen
atom. On the contrary, the astonishing fact appears that the size
of a cathode-ray particle is at least one thousand times less than that
of the hydrogen atom, the smallest of all hitherto known atoms;
that is, a thousand times smaller than the body, which, as the name
implies, is so minute as to have been heretofore considered indivisible.
This recently discovered particle carrying an elementary quantity of
negative electricity has been named an electron.

It will be readily believed that physicists would not accept a state-
ment so contradictory to the views previously held without rigid
examination, and that the existence of the electron would not be
credited without further proof. But since numerous investigators,
working by different methods, have found the same value for the mass
of the unknown electron, and after this value has proved itself
invariable, whether the electrons were produced by an electric dis-
charge through a vacuum tube, or by an illumination with ultra-
violet or X-rays, or by means of a Bunsen burner or a thorium
preparation, and, further, after it has been shown that it is entirely
indifferent which gas we work in, whether hydrogen, oxygen, or the
air, we can not deny the fact that a negative electron of a mass
approximately one one-thousandth of that of the hydrogen atom can
be isolated from every substance.

The question at once arises, have we here the primal substance in-
forming all matter and out of which the entire universe is built up?
Is the electron the already long sought for primary atom, through the
grouping of which in varying numbers and diverse positions all
material substances, and consequently the primary elements them-
selves, originate? May we not hope that the chemical structure of
the atom depends on the chemical structure of the molecule? Since
“ach chemical atom is characterized by its own spectrum, may not
one imagine that each atom illustrates in an infinitesimal degree a
planetary system, in which the central body would be a positively
electrified germ around which, according to the element under obser-
vation, a differing number of electrons perform their revolutions im
prescribed paths, exactly as the earth, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, and
the rest continue their endless circuits around the sun? Many physi-
cists believe this to be so, but it is still too early, would lead too far,
and as yet we know too little about the electron to attempt to decide
RADIOACTIVITY. 125

this question. We are satisfied to have established the fact that there
are atomic processes, that an atom is not indivisible, and that smaller
particles may be isolated from it.

We were attempting to find an explanation of the enormous quan-
tity of energy given out by radium, but has the knowledge of the
composite nature of the atom brought us farther in this direction ?
Yes, undoubtedly, for there are many reasons to believe that if a
body so apparently indivisible as the atom, one which so long resisted
all our efforts, may be subdivided, that there must be enormous stores
of energy which can be set free, differing entirely from those we
have had an opportunity to study in the molecular processes and by
the ordinary chemical methods. The question then follows: Is there
ground for the belief that a similar atomic disintegration may take
place in radium? Undoubtedly so, for the present condition favors
the belief that radium is constantly sending out cathode rays and
generating electrons. We are furthermore able to produce a more
direct proof which may be postulated directly from the electron
theory, and which admits of demonstration quite independent of
that hypothesis.

When an atom gives off an elemental electron its weight must thus
be lessened, which is in effect to say that the atom is no longer :
component part of the former element but has united with another.
We assert, therefore, emphatically that since proof has been given
that atomic processes are possible, that atoms separate and can sub-
divide themselves, it must be possible that one element may convert
itself into another, or, for example, that gold may come from lead.
Whether we shall ever succeed in converting gold into lead is quite
another question, which I will not discuss now, but the investigation
of the electron favors the belief that such a transformation is not
impossible. And in radium it has in fact been made possible to
observe the process of the change of one element into another.
Rutherford foretold it, and Ramsay and Soddy were the first to bring
proof of the transmutation of the radium emanation into helium.

If a radium preparation is placed in a glass container in a dark-
ened room, a weird, grayish, but slightly luminous, sort of a mist is
seen to arise from it. If the container is closed, it is gradually
filled by this mist, or gas, which steadily gains so much in luminosity
that in a day or two one can tell the time on a watch by it. If this
luminous fog is blown out of the glass, the play begins over again
until the container emits light as before. The so-called radium
emanation is thus seen to develop itself continuously.

What is it? T conduct the luminous air which contains the emana-
tion through the strongest gases and lyes and it remains unchanged.
T conduct it over incandescent copper or magnesium and it is the
same. I have no power over it. I transmit it through a tube which
126 RADIOACTIVITY.

has been cooled in liquid air and the emanation is no longer lumin-
ous, but the walls of the cold tube emit strong ght. I conse-
quently decide that the emanation is a gaseous body which, as more
exact research has proved, condenses at 150°. It emits a rays, which
the air renders luminous and electrically conductive. Without these
properties in the emitted rays we should never have discovered the
gas, for our supply of radium is almost invisibly small. Ramsay and
Soddy announce that from 60 mg. of radium they obtained in four
days one-fiftieth of a mm.* of the pure emanation, unmixed with air;
that is, an amount which would fill a receptacle scarcely so large as
the head of a small pin. Imagine this amount to be diffused
through the laboratory of a physicist, and he would hardly be aware
of it, but perhaps not because it was so little, but because it was so
much that his apparatus would refuse to work, its isolation being
destroyed. This illustration gives an idea of the sensitiveness of
the methods through which we can discover the minutest traces of
the radioactive substances by estimating the conductivity of the
atmosphere.

If we succeed in collecting a like amount of the emanation in a
glass vacuum tube, it will emit a bright light, which in a few days
will become noticeably weaker, and in a few weeks will disappear,
while we find in its place, by exact spectroscopic experiment, traces
of a gas which certainly was not present before, namely, helium.
These experiments have been conducted in the most diverse cireum-
stances by many investigators, a part of whom approached the task
with no expectation of finding this result confirmed, so that there is
no room for doubt that radium, a chemical element, as positively
defined as gold or iron, or as any emanation which has been secured,
transforms itself into helium, an equally sharply defined element.

We have thus seen one element transformed into another, an occur-
rence never before witnessed and long held impossible. In such a
process, which is possible only by a change in the atom itself by the
separation of a part of it, an enormous amount of energy must be set
free, and when such a process actually takes place in radium an
appreciable amount of warmth must be obtained; but in spite of this
we can discover no change in the weight of the preparation itself.
One difficulty in bringing the phenomena of radium into accord with
the principle of energy is now removed. Instead of a failure of the
principles of the natural sciences, held unchangeable by the timid
doubter of the phenomena of the radioactive substances, the view of
an entirely new world, the world of atoms, has been revealed to us.
We need no longer stop with the chemical elements, but may study
the origin and dissolution of these forms also, which have hitherto
been held as preexistent and unchangeable.

In fact, gratifying advance has already been made, especially by
RADIOACTIVITY. 197

/

the experiments of Rutherford, in this direction. Consequently
we have uranium, the element with the highest atomic weight, con-
sisting of the greatest number of electrons and which, in accord-
ance with the electron hypothesis, we accept as the mother substance.
A something which so far we have been unable to seize hold of and
to analyze isolates itself from the mother substance and we have
radium, out of which, as already noted, the radium emanation arises.
We know the constituents into which this separates—namely, helium
and the so-called “ radium A.” Then radium B appears and out of
it radium C, and so on until we reach radium G. These intermediate
products, called “ metabolons,” are so far known to us only through
their radioactive properties. No one has yet seen, weighed, or meas-
ured them; but in spite of this we are able to distinguish them by the
rays which they emit, as well as by their period of duration.

Let us take, for example, the radium emanation B, whose presence
we note through the luminosity of the air, and it is easy to show
that this emits only the shghtly persistent rays which, deflected
by a magnet, show the characteristics of a positive electric charge.
If we leave a body for a day or two in this emanation, it begins to
show itself radioactive. It might be said that this is only from the
traces of the emanation left on its surface, just as a platinum wire
would show traces of hydrogen gas in which it had been left. It
1s true that something which I can not see with the finest optical
instruments, but which I can remove with muriatic acid, or by
polishing with sandpaper, has attached itself to the surface of the
body. This product is certainly not an emanation whose rays, as
well known, will not go through a sheet of paper; while with the
rays emitted by the piece of wood, glass, or metal, which I have left
in the emanation I can influence a photographic plate through a
screen. The rays emitted by the body thus treated, whatever it
may be, whether a needle, pencil, cork, or morsel of bread, are hardly
less penetrating than the Réntgen ray. And not only by the nature
of the ray, but by its duration can it be shown that it is now a ques-
tion of a new substance. The measure of the duration of activity,
or the half-value, as that time is called during which the activity of
these substances is diminished one half, has been one of the most
serviceable means of identifying them. <A radioactive body is one in
process of transmutation, and experience has shown that this action
always proceeds at the same rate in a given substance. The radium
emanation loses one-half of its activity in four davs; radium ©, the
more penetrating rays of which I have just referred to, does the
same in twenty-eight minutes. The half-value of the thorium ema-
nation is fifty-four seconds; on the other hand, the half-value of the
excited thorium activity corresponding to radium C, is eleven hours.
Given an unknown radioactive substance to identify, I estimate the
128 RADIOACTIVITY.

activity of a certain ray which it emits, repeating the experiment
in from one to two hours. I then estimate the decay of activity dur-
ing this time and thus decide whether I am dealing with a new or a
known substance. We are thus in a position, as has been said, to
distinguish disintegration products of uranium down to radium G,
and to determine their characteristic radiations and half-value times.

It may be said that in experimenting with radium G the substance
disappears in the very hands of the investigator, but that is not sur-
prising if we keep in mind the fact that the quantity of material
treated in these experiments is so infinitesimal that its presence can
be proved only by its radioactivity. Whether it changes into a less
active or an entirely inactive substance, it apparently disappears;
its mass 1s too inconsiderable to be weighed, too minute to be detected
by the microscope; there is no instrument by which its presence
can be proved. Progress is possible in this direction only when we
have a larger supply of radium. More radium is the emphatic
demand of the medical man, the chemist, and the physicist. So far,
therefore, we have been able to decide only indirectly into what
radium F is transformed, but, through experiments which need not
now be described, the conclusion has been reached that radium F must
become lead.

It is an interesting fact that a large number of minerals which
contain uranium always contain helium and radium A—F, and also
lead in appreciable quantities. That surely favors the preceding
supposition. The task is now to show that such a metal can have
originated only from the mother substance—uranium—a portion of
which in the course of centuries has passed through the transmuta-
tions hamed; so that now one such specimen contains not only
uranium, grandmother, mother, and chtld, but nine generations fol-
lowing closely on each other. We could thus trace the genealogy of
lead back to uranium without a break.

The next question is: Are the less radioactive substances to be con-
sidered as evidence of an earlier period of the earth’s development;
have such substances now reached a fixed, a final condition, and can
there at present be shown a single example of the development and
transmutation process, such as the other elements have passed
through? Or, on the contrary, are all elements radioactive and still
in a state of progressive development? We must not at once say
“no” to these questions, for the reason that we have not yet observed
radioactive qualities in these elements. We need only remember
that it is easy to prove magnetic qualities in steel and iron, while in
aluminum the apparent magnetic energy is a hundred million times
less, and if we had only such substances as aluminum, copper, and
zine at our disposal we might not to-day understand the phenomena
of electricity. After an opportunity to study these phenomena with

RADIOACTIVITY. 129

comparative ease in iron and steel, to learn their laws and to know
what such an investigation requires, with ever finer and more accu-
rate instruments we may be able to prove the existence of magnetic
qualities in all substances. Shall we at some future time be able to
do the same with radioactivity ?

Experiments have already been made in this direction, and numer-
ous physicists believe that their researches lead to the conclusion that
all bodies are radioactive. They believe it can be proved that lead,
zinc, etc., send out rays by which the air is made conductive. As
corroboration of this, experiments are made to show that an elec-
troscope inclosed in lead would lose its charge more rapidly than if
inclosed in zinc. We must not lose sight of the fact, however, that
our instruments are surprisingly sensitive, and that for that reason
the shghtest admixture of radioactive substances with those under
examination might cause results similar to those observed.

I have referred to the fact that the presence of the radioactive
emanation in all our springs shows the wide diffusion of radium in
the earth. It shows, also, how easily one substance by coming in
contact with another is affected by it. Elster and Geitel have now
found proof that the radioactive emanation is everywhere present
in the atmosphere, in the deepest excavations and shafts, as well as
on the highest elevations, and that the appreciable quantity varies
with rising and falling air pressure, dust, fog, rain, and snow. It
will be easily understood how difficult this must render experiments
in this direction, and how cautious one must be in reporting observa-
tions. From previous experiments it may be safely inferred that in
the metals possessing radioactivity it is thousands of times weaker
than in radium. It is certainly conceivable that the activity of these
substances may be demonstrated by other methods and that they
emit rays whose action has so far escaped us. Ten years ago such
a suggestion would have been regarded as an idle dream, but such
phenomena as wireless telegraphy, the Réntgen rays, and radio-
activity have made us more cautious in criticism and bolder in hy:
pothesis. Now that we have discovered the electron, have seen that an
atom can subdivide into others, and have actually succeeded in observ-
ing one element transforming itself into another, it can not be
regarded amiss if we venture to look for similar phenomona in the
other elements. I do not hesitate to acknowledge that I class myself
with those whose hope takes them much farther than this, even.

We must seek to gain power over the atomic processes, to control
them as we now control the molecular processes. As we can to-day
decompose water, and by reversing the operation can reproduce it, as
we have learned to create thousands of organic substances, which
were earlier believed to be beyond the power of man to produce, and

sm 1906——9
130 RADIOACTIVITY.

which were supposed to come into existence through certain life
processes only, we must learn to separate the electron from the atom
or to decompose it into a group of electrons, and perhaps out of these
to build up a certain desired element. The solving of the first of these
problems would become at once of great practical significance. Our
control of the powers of nature would thus attain development beyond
imagination, would be increased a million fold; for, however incred1-
ble it may sound, the processes with which we have hitherto been
occupied are of minor importance compared with the atomic proc-
esses.

Are we to succeed in solving this problem? That the path
toward the goal is long and difficult and not easily followed no one
will deny. To learn to control thousandfold greater supplies of
energy may well offer difficulties a thousandfold greater, but the
notable results of the study of the powers of nature, increasing from
decade to decade through the last century, inspire us with courage
and arouse hope of great achievements in the new century already
so full of promise. The naturalist of to-day is not pessimistic. If at
first we are allowed to lft only a little corner of the veil with
which nature has so carefully concealed the secret we pursue, we will
not relinquish hope, but will

RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.+

By CHEVALIER G. Marconi, LL. D., D. Se, M. R. I.

The phenomena of electro-magnetic induction, revealed chiefly by
the memorable researches and discoveries of Faraday carried out in
the Royal Institution, have long since shown how it is possible for
the transmission of electrical energy to take place across a small air
space between a conductor traversed by a variable current and
another conductor placed near it, and how such transmission may be
detected and observed at distances greater or less, according to the

eeot.

more or less rapid variation of the current in one of the wires, and
also according to the greater or less quantity of electricity brought
into play.

Maxwell, inspired by Faraday’s work, gave to the world in 1873
his wonderful mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism,
demonstrating on theoretical grounds the existence of electro-mag-
netic waves, fundamentally similar to but enormously longer than

waves of light. Following up Maxwell, Hertz in 1887 furnished his
great practical proof of the existence of these true electro-magnetic
waves.

Building on the foundations prepared by these great men, the
author carried out in 1895 and 1896 his first tests, with apparatus
which embodied the principle on which long-distance wireless teleg-
raphy is successfully worked at the present day.

This early arrangement is shown in figures 1, 2, and 3.

In figures 1 and 2 are shown diagrammatically the complete trans-
mitting and receiving plants, and in figure 3 are shown the circuits
of the receiving instruments.

The main feature of the system is the utilization of the earth
effect by connecting both the transmitting and receiving instruments
between earth and a raised capacity.

The later improvements introduced in the author’s system of wire-
less telegraphy have been directed toward the following ends:

1. To obtain independence of communication or the prevention of
interference between several neighboring stations.

2. To increase the distance of communication.

3. To increase the efficiency of the apparatus, its accuracy, and
working speed.

One of the chief objections which is raised against wireless teleg-
raphy is that it 1s possible to work only two or a very limited number
of stations in the immediate vicinity of each other without causing
mutual interference or producing a jumble by the confusion of the
different messages. This objection appears to be much more serious
to that section of the public which knows little or nothing of teleg-
raphy in general than to telegraph engineers, who know that with-
out organization and discipline the same interference would occur in
the great majority of ordinary land telegrams. For example, there
is an ““omnibus ” line between Cork and Crookhaven. On this line
there are a dozen or more telegraph offices, all with their instruments
joined up to the same wire running from the terminal stations. Now,
RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. i835}

if any of these offices should proceed to send a message, say, to Cork,
while this office is receiving another message from Crookhaven, it
would cause an interference which would result in the confusion of
the two messages, thus rendering them unintelligible. Any message
sent on the line will affect all the instruments and can be read by all
the other telegraph offices on the line; but certain rules and regula-
tions are laid down and adhered to by the operators in the employ of
the General Post-Office which make it impossible for one station to
interfere with the rest. It is obvious that these same rules are appli-
cable to every case in which a group of equally tuned wireless tele-
graph stations happen to be in proximity to each other.

Although in many instances untuned wireless telegraphy may
prove of great utility, it is, however, clear that so long as some method
of rendering stations completely independent of one another was not

Fig. 5.

devised, a very important and effectual limit to the practical utiliza-
tion of wireless telegraphy would be imposed.

The new method adopted by the author in 1898, of connecting a
proper form of oscillation transformer in conjunction with a con-
denser (fig. 4), so as to form a resonator tuned to respond best to
waves emitted by a given length of vertical wire, was a step in the
right direction. This improvement was described by the author in
a discourse which he had the honor to deliver in the royal institution
in February, 1900.

Apart, however, from these improvements introduced into the
receiving circuits, it had been for some time apparent that one diffi-
culty in the way of obtaining syntonic effects was caused by the
action of the transmitting wire. This straight rod or wire in which
electrical oscillations are set up, forms, as is well known, a very good
radiator or emitter of electric waves; but at the same time in all such
1384 RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

good radiators electrical oscillations set up by the ordinary spark-
discharge method cease or are damped out very quickly by the elec-
trical radiation, which removes very rapidly the small amount of
their stored-up energy.

It is well known that if two tuning forks are taken having the
same periods of vibration or note and one of them is set in motion
by striking it sharply, waves or sounds will form in the air; and the
other tuning fork, if in suitable proximity, will immediately com-
mence to vibrate or sound in unison with the first.

Of course tuning forks have to do with air waves and wireless
telegraphy with ether waves, but the action in both cases is analogous.

There is one essential condition which must be fulfilled in order
that a well-marked tuning or electrical resonance may take place,
and it is based on the fact that what we call electrical resonance,

Fie. 6. Fig. 7.

like mechanical resonance, depends essentially upon the accumulated
effect of a large number of feeble impulses properly timed. Tuning
can only be achieved if a sufficient number of these timed electrical
impulses reach the receiver.

Over four years ago the author obtained satisfactory results by
increasing the electrical capacity of the radiating and resonating
conductors by arranging them at each station in the form of two
concentric cylinders, or in other forms of closely adjacent conductors.
The electrical capacity of such conductors, as shown in fig. 6, is very
large compared with that of a single vertical wire, with the result
that the amount of electrical energy stored up in the system referred
to in the first case is much larger, and does not radiate or get away
in one or two waves, but forms a train of timed impulses which sub-
sist for a certain time, which is what is required.
RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 135

An arrangement consisting of a circuit containing a condenser and
a spark gap, fig. 8, constitutes a very persistent oscillator. Sir Oliver
Lodge has shown that by placing it near to another similar circuit
it is possible to demonstrate effects of tuning. The experiment is
usually referred to as “ Lodge’s syntonic jars,’ and is extremely
interesting, but, as Lodge himself points out in his book, the Work
of Hertz, a closed cirewit such as this is “a feeble radiator and a
feeble absorber, so that it is not adapted for action at a distance.”

If, however, such an oscillating circuit is inductively associated
with one of the author’s elevated radiators, it is possible to cause
the energy contained in the closed circuit to radiate to great dis-
tances, the essential condition being that the natural period of elec-
trical oscillation of the radiator should be equa]
to that of the nearly closed circuit.

All the latest syntonic transmitting arrange- |@
ments are based on modifications of this combina- €
tion.

The general arrangement is indicated in fig. 7.

The arrangement for syntonizing or tuning the
receiving stations are shown in fig. 5. Here is
shown the usual vertical conductor connected to C
earth through the primary of a transformer, the
secondary circuit of which contains a condenser,

which is connected across the coherer or detector.
In this case, also, it is necessary that the period 3 ~){|
of electrical oscillations of the vertical wire, which a

. : q Fig. 8.
includes the primary of the transformer and earth ‘

connection, should be equal to that of, or in tune with, the secondary
circuit of the said transformer, which circuit includes a condenser.
Therefore, in order that a transmitter (fig. 7) should be in tune with
the receiver (fig. 5), it is necessary that the periods of oscillation of
the several oscillating circuits at both stations should be equal, or very
approximately so.

It is easy to understand that if we have several stations, each tuned
to a different period of electrical oscillation, the periods of resonance
of which are known, it will not be difficult to transmit messages to
any one of them without the signals being picked up by the other
stations for which they are not intended. It is obvious that the
greater the difference in periods of the oscillation or tune between
two stations, the smaller will be the possibility of tapping and mutual
interference.

It is also possible to connect to one sending wire, through the con-
nections of different inductances, several differently tuned trans-
mitters, and to a receiving wire a number of corresponding receivers,
as is shown in figs. 9 and 10.
136 RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

It was possible nearly five years ago to send different messages
simultaneously without interference, the messages being received on
differently tuned receivers connected to the same vertical conductor.

This result was described in the Times of October 4, 1900, by Pro-
fessor Fleming, who, in company with others, witnessed the test.

A recent improvement introduced in the method of tuning the
receiver is that shown in fig. 11.

There exists at present among the large section of the public con-
siderable misconception as to the feasibility of tuning or syntonizing
wireless telegraphic installations, and also as to what is generally
termed “the interception of messages.” According to the accepted
understanding, “ intercepting ” a message means or imples securing
by force, or by other means, a communication which is intended for
somebody else, thereby preventing the intended recipient from re-

celving it. Now,

Of course, if a powerful transmitter giving off strong waves of differ-
ent frequencies is actuated near one of the receiving stations, it may
prevent the reception of messages, but the party working the so-
called interfering station is at the same time unable to read the mes-
sage he is trying to destroy, and therefore the message is not, in the
popular sense of the word, “ intercepted.” It should be remembered

Earth

that any telegraph or telephone wire can be tapped, or the conversa-
tion going on through it overheard, or its operation interfered with.
Sir William Preece has published results which go to show that it
is possible to pick up at a distance on another circuit the conversa-
tion which may be passing through a telephone or telegraph wire.

Up to the commencement of 1902 the only receivers that could
be practically employed for the purposes of wireless telegraphy were
based on what may be called the coherer principle—that is, the
detector, the principle of which is based on the discoveries and
observations made by S. A. Varley, Professor Hughes, Calsecchi
Onesti, and Professor Branly.

Early in that year the author was fortunate enough to succeed in
constructing a practical receiver of electric waves, based on a prin-
ciple different from that of the coherer. Speaking from the ex-
perience of its application for over two years to commercial pur-
poses, the author is able to say that, in so far as concerns speed of
working, facility of ad-
justment, reliability, and
efficiency when used on
tuned circuits, this receiver
has left all coherers or
anticoherers far behind.

The action of this re-
ceiver is in the author’s
opinion based upon the de-
crease of magnetic hystere-
sis, which takes place in iron when under certain conditions this metal
is exposed to high frequency oscillations of Hertzian waves.

It is constructed in the following manner and is shown in fig. 12.

On an insulating sleeve surrounding a portion of a core, consisting
of an endless rope of thin iron wires, are wound one or two layers of
thin insulated copper wires. Over this winding insulating material is
placed, and over this again another longer winding of thin copper
wire contained in a narrow bobbin. The ends of the windings nearer
the iron core are connected one to earth and the other to the elevated
conductor, or they may be joined to any suitable syntonizing circuit,
such as is now employed for syntonic wireless telegraphy. The ends
of the longer winding are connected to the terminals of a suitable
telephone. A pair of horseshoe magnets are conveniently disposed
for magnetizing the portion of the core surrounded by the windings,
and the endless iron core is caused to move continuously through the
windings and the field of the horseshoe magnets.

This detector is and has been successfully employed for both long
and short distance work. It is used on the ships of the Royal Navy
and on all trans-Atlantic ners which are carrying on a long-distance

138 RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

news service. It has also been used to a large extent in the tests
across the Atlantic Ocean.

As already stated, the adoption of this magnetic receiver was the
means of bringing about a great improvement in the practical work-
ing conditions of wireless telegraphy by making it possible to do away
with the troublesome adjustments necessary when using coherers, and
also by considerably increasing the speed at which it is possible to
receive, the speed depending solely on the ability of the individual
operators. Thus a speed of over 30 words a minute has been easily
attained with the apparatus as shown in fig. 12.

This form of magnetic receiver, however, presented a disadvantage
which some people considered very important—of being able to bring
about only an audible reproduction of the signals in a telephone, and
consequently ineffective for actuating a recording instrument, such as
would leave a documentary proof in the form of Morse signals received
and inscribed on tape.

When the author had the honor to deliver his last lecture at the
Royal Institution, he expressed a hope that by means of this magnetic
receiver it might be possible to work a recording instrument, and he
is glad to be able to announce that he has recently been able to con-
struct a magnetic receiver that will work a relay and a recorder.

The causes which prevented the author’s earlier type of magnetic
receiver from working a relay were the rapidity and alternating
character of the current induced by the effect of the oscillations on
the iron. This current or impulse is so sudden that, although it
proves to be suitable in producing a sound or click in a telephone
diaphragm, it is far too quick to impart any appreciable movement
to the comparatively heavy tongue of a relay, and in that way to
allow a current to work a recording or other instrument. By modi-
fying the circuits, especially by increasing their length and by the
use of a particular quality of iron, the author has been able to obtain
an impulse from the magnetic receiver, which is capable of working a
recording instrument.

The instrument is eminently adapted for receiving messages from
stations such as Poldhu, where the length of wave radiated 1s con-
siderable.

The advantages of this receiver over the coherer system of receiver
are very great.

In the first place, it is far more simple, requires far less attention,
is absolutely reliable and constant in its action, and possesses a low
and unvarying resistance. But the chief advantage lies in the fact
that with this receiver it is possible to attain a very high speed of
working.

The speed of the author’s earlier form of magnetic receivers was

2
RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 139

limited to the rate at which the operator could read by sound. So
for as speed is concerned, however, this new detector is not dependent
upon the ability of the operator. It is possible to use an automatic
transmitter to send messages at the rate of 100 words a minute, and
the messages will be picked up and recorded quite clearly and dis-
tinctly by means of this new form of receiver.

The author here gave a demonstration of wireless transmission
and reception by means of high speed ‘“ Wheatstone ” instruments
lent by the General Post-Office, used in conjunction with his mag-
netic receiver.

This form of recording receiver has been satisfactorily worked
over a distance of 152 miles over land, and will shortly be employed
in connection with the new transatlantic stations.

In conjunction with Professor Fleming, the author has recently
introduced further improvements which greatly increase the efliciency
of the apparatus, but which he is not at present free to describe.
The author here demonstrated the effect of the improvement by
means of a galvanometer, showing the deflection without and with
the new device. The author also exhibited and explained Doctor Flem-
ing’s cymometer for measuring the length of waves used in wireless
telegraphy.¢

A very considerable amount of public interest has been centered
during the last few years on the tests and experiments in which the
author has been engaged in investigating the possibilities of wireless
telegraphy over very great distances, and especially on the tests which
are being carried out across the Atlantic Ocean.

The facility with which distances of over 200 miles could be cov-
ered with the author’s apparatus as long ago as 1900, and the knowl-
edge that by means of syntonic devices mutual interferences could
be prevented, led the author to advise the construction of two large
power stations, one in Cornwall and the other in North America, in
order to test whether, by the employment of much greater power, it
might not be possible to transmit messages across the Atlantic Ocean.

On the erection of these stations very extensive tests and experi-
ments were carried out during the latter part of 1902. These tests
were greatly facilitated by the courtesy of the Italian Government,
which placed a 7,000-ton cruiser, the Carlo Alberto, at the author’s
disposal. During these trials the interesting fact was observed that,
unlike what occurs with moderate power-transmitting stations, the
effect of intervening land or mountains between the sending and
recelving apparatus does not bring about any considerable reduc-

tion in the distances over which it is possible to communicate; this
result being due, no doubt, to the much greater length of wave radi-
ated by the big elevated conductor of the long-distance stations,
compared with the shorter wave-length radiated by the smaller and
less powerful installations. Thus messages were received from Poldhu
at the positions marked on the map (fig. 13), which is a copy of the
map accompanying the official report of the experiments. These posi-
tions, at which signals were received direct from Poldhu, are in the
Baltic near Sweden, at Kiel, the North Sea, the Bay of Biscay, also
Ferrol, Cadiz, Gibraltar, Sardinia, and Spezia. Messages were re-
ceived distinctly in these places from Cornwall, although, in the Baltic,

the whole of England, the Netherlands, and part of Germany and
Scandinavia lay between Poldhu and the Carlo Alberto. Also, at
Cadiz and Gibraltar the whole of Spain intervened ; and at Spezia and
Cagliari, in the Mediterranean, the whole of France, including the
Alps, lay in a direct line between the two stations.

After these experiments the Carlo Alberto was sent back from the
Mediterranean to Plymouth, and thence conveyed the author to Can-
ada; and in October, 1902, signals from Poldhu were received on
board ship throughout the voyage up to a distance of 2,300 miles.

In December, 1902, messages were exchanged between the stations
at Poldhu and Cape Breton, but it was found that communication
was better from Canada to England than in the opposite direction.
RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 141

The reason for this is to be attributed to the fact that, owing
to the support and encouragement of the Canadian government, the
station at Cape Breton had been more efficiently and more expen-
sively equipped; whilst as regards Poldhu, owing to the uncertainty
as to what would be the attitude of the British Government at that
time toward the working of the station, the author’s company was
unwilling to expend large sums of money for the purpose of increas-
ing its range of transmission.

As, however, messages were sent with ease and accuracy from
Canada to England, the author considered it his duty to send the
first messages to their Majesties the Kings of England and Italy,
both of whom had previously given him much encouragement and
assistance in his work. The author was thus enabled to announce
that the transmission of telegraphic messages across the Atlantic
Ocean without the use of cable or wire was an accomplished fact.
Messages were also sent to His Majesty from Lord Minto, the Gov-
ernor-General of Canada, who had taken a considerable interest in
the author’s early experiments in Canada. Officers delegated by the
Italian Government and a representative of the London Times were
present at the transmission of the messages, and over 2,000 words
were sent and correctly received in the presence of these Government
delegates.

Further tests were then carried out at the long-distance station
erected at Cape Cod, in the United States of America, and a message
from President Roosevelt was successfully transmitted from this
station to His Majesty the King.

In the spring of 1903 the transmission of news messages from
America to the London Times was attempted, and the first messages
were correctly received and published in that newspaper. <A break-
down in the insulation of the apparatus at Cape Breton made it
necessary, however, to suspend the service, and, unfortunately, further
accidents made the transmission of messages unreliable, especially
during the spring and summer. In consequence of this, the author’s
company decided not to attempt the transmission of any more public
messages until such time as a reliable and continuous service could be
maintained and guaranteed under all ordinary conditions.

It is curious to note that the transmission of messages across the
Atlantic appeared to be much easier during the winter months of
December, January, and February than during the spring and sum-
mer, but no serious difficulties were encountered before April. These
were partly caused by the insulation of the aerial not being so good
during the damp spring weather, when the snow and ice are melting
and thawing, as at this period the insulation is much more difficult
to maintain in an efficient condition than during the dry and crisp
Canadian winter.
142 RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

A new station, supplied with more powerful and more perfect
apparatus, is in course of erection, and the author has not the shght-
est doubt but that in a very short time the practicability and relia-
bility of transatlantic wireless telegraphy will be fully demonstrated.

In connection with these very powerful stations it is interesting
to observe that the fact which the author had noticed in 1895 and
which he expressed in his patent of June 2, 1896, that “the larger the
plates (or capacities) of the receiver and transmitter and the higher
from the earth the plates are suspended the greater the distance that
it is possible to communicate at parity of other conditions,” still
holds good, and therefore the elevated conductors at these stations
are much larger and higher than those used at the smaller power
stations. The potential to which they are charged is also very much
in excess of that used at the short-distance stations.

Pending the reconstruction of these long-distance stations, valuable
tests have been carried out, and daily commercial work is carried on
over distances of about 2,000 miles. In October, 1903, it was found
possible to supply the Cunard steamship Lucania during her entire
crossing from New York to Liverpool with news transmitted direct
to that ship from Poldhu and Cape Breton.

Since June a regular long-distance commercial service has been in
operation on certain ships of the Cunard Steamship Company, which
ships, throughout their voyage across the Atlantic, receive daily news
messages collected for transmission by Messrs. Reuter in England,
and by the Associated Press in America. At present five trans-
Atlantic steamships are thus publishing a daily newspaper contain-
ing telegraphic messages of the latest news.

The practical and experimental work carried out in connection
with the long and short distance stations has afforded valuable
opportunities for noting and studying various unknown and unex-
pected effects of the condition of space on the propagation of electro-
magnetic waves.

The author being able to avail himself of the daily reports of over
70 ships and 50 land stations, the chances of error from what might
be termed accidental results are reduced to a minimum. Thus it is
interesting to observe that the difference between the propagation of
the wave by day and by night is only noticeable in the case of long-
distance stations; or, in other words, where a considerable amount
of energy is forced into the transmitting aerial wires. For instance,
all the short-distance ship-to-shore stations having a range of about
150 miles averaged the same distance of communication by day as
by night; but the long-distance stations, such as Poldhu, Cape
Breton, and Cape Cod, as originally constructed, averaged by day
two-fifths of the distance covered by night.
RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY: 1438

The opinion has been expressed that the reason for shorter dis-
tances being covered by day is due to the electrons propagated into
space by the sun, and that if these are continually falling like a
shower upon the earth, in accordance with the hypothesis of Professor
Arrhenius, then that portion of the earth’s atmosphere which is facing
the sun will have in it more electrons than the part which is not facing
the sun, and therefore it may be less transparent to long Hertzian
waves.

The full scientific explanation of this fact has not yet been given,
but Prof. J. J. Thomson has shown in an interesting paper in the
Philosophical Magazine? that if electrons are distributed in a space
traversed by long electric waves, these will tend to move the electrons
in the direction of the wave, and will therefore absorb some of the
energy of the wave. Hence, as Professor Fleming has pointed out in
his Cantor lectures delivered at the Society of Arts, a medium through
which electrons or ions are distributed acts as a slightly turbid
medium to long electric waves.

In fact, clear sunlight or blue skies, though very transparent to
hght-waves, may act as a fog to Hertzian waves. Apparently the
amplitude of the electrical oscillations radiated has much to do with
the interesting phenomenon, for the author has found that if a con-
siderable amount of power is applied to the radiating apparatus of
the so-called short-distance stations, the difference between the range
of transmission by night and by day becomes at once apparent,
although no difference is made in the wave length radiated.

A curious feature of what may be called the daylight effect is the
suddenness with which it may cut off the signals at great distances.
These do not, as might be supposed, die off gradually as daylight
increases, but seem to fade away rapidly, and disappear entirely
within the space of about two minutes.

The author does not for a moment think that this daylight effect
will prove to be a serious drawback to the practical application of
long-distance wireless telegraphy, as its result amounts to this, that
rather more power is required by day than by night to send signals
by means of electric waves over long distances.

It has been stated that one of the serious objections to wireless
telegraphy lay in the fact that no means existed for directing the
energy emitted by the stations. If we assume this fact to be correct,
we certainly find that, if it presents certain disadvantages, it also
presents many perhaps counterbalancing advantages. For example,
if a cable is laid between England and Canada it can only serve for
communication between these two countries; but if a wireless connec-

tion is established between two such countries the stations may be
instantly used in time of war, or in any other emergency, to communi-
cate with other stations, situated say, at Gibraltar, the West Indies,
or some inland point in North America, and also, if necessary, with
war ships carrying apparatus tuned to the waves such stations radiate.
By means of syntony, although the energy can not be directed in one
direction, it can, however, be picked up at certain distances only by
certain tuned receivers, as occurs now with the ships crossing the
ocean. Fifty of these ships carry wireless apparatus, but only five of
them have the instrument tuned to receive the long-distance news
messages sent from Poldhu; and, as a matter of fact, these messages
are received only by those five specially tuned ships.

Before concluding, it may not be out of place to give a few details
as to the practical uses to which the author’s system of wireless
telegraphy has already been put.

There are now over 80 British and 30 Italian war ships equipped.
A number of these war ships are fitted with long-distance apparatus,
and are therefore able to keep in touch with England when far out
on the Atlantic, at Gibraltar, and in the Mediterranean. Admiral
Lord Charles Beresford has authorized the author to say that during
the last cruise of the Channel Fleet from Gibraltar to England they
had no difficulty whatever in receiving messages from Cornwall
during the entire voyage by means of special long-distance receivers.

Seventy liners, belonging respectively to England, Italy, France,
Germany, Holland, Belgium, and the United States, are fitted with
the author’s apparatus, and are engaged in carrying on commercial
work for the benefit of passengers between ship and ship and between
ship and shore; and for this latter purpose there are over 50 land
stations with which to communicate. During 1904, 67,625 com-
mercial messages were sent and received at the ship and shore stations
controlled by the author’s company.

It is also used as a branch of the Italian telegraphic system for
ordinary commercial purposes across the Adriatic Sea, namely,
between Bari (in Italy) and Antivari (in Montenegro), and in the
Straits of Messina at Messina, Reggio, and Giovanni. Also, in con-
nection with the British post-office, from Cornwall to the Scilly
Tslands, on the not infrequent occasions of the breaking down of the
cables.

As to the future of wireless telegraphy, the author expresses his
confidence in its ability to furnish a more economical means for the
transmission of telegrams from England to America and from Eng-
land to the colonies than the present service carried on by the cables.

It is true that many scientific men are dubious of the practicability
of sending electric waves to great distances. Others are not. On
RECENT ADVANCES IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 145

a recent memorable occasion at Glasgow University, Lord Kelvin
publicly stated that he not merely believed that messages could be
transmitted across the Atlantic, but that some day it would be pos-
sible to send messages to the other side of the globe. Apart from the
practical and economical possibilities of this step, when realized, the
transmission of messages to the Antipodes would open up the possi-
bility of carrying out tests of very great scientific interest. For
example, if transmission to the Antipodes were possible, the energy
ought to go over or travel round all parts of the globe from one
station to the other, and perhaps concentrate at the Antipodes, and
in this way it might perhaps be possible for messages to be sent to
such distant lands by means of a very small amount of electrical
energy, and, therefore, at a correspondingly small expense.

REVISIONS OF THE THEORY OF ELECTROLYSIS.¢
By Henry S. CarHart, LL. D.

No subject in the whole domain of theoretical electricity possesses
more interest to the electrochemist than the theory of the decompo-
sition of aqueous solutions of salts and acids through the agency of
an electric current. For more than a hundred years scientific atten-
tion has been converged on it, for it has presented problems both of
unusual interest and of unusual difficulty. Its development has not
been one of uninterrupted progress, but rather one of leaps and
bounds, alternating with seasons of suspended animation. Even
with the noteworthy additions of the past twenty years, it can not
be said that all difficulties have yet been resolved. We are in little
danger of so completely clearing up the entire field that nothing shall
be left for posterity.

An historical review of this subject, biased it may be by perspec-
tive and distorted by the disproportionately large visual angle under
which we view recent events, may yet give us more respect for the
achievements of the past and less unreserved satisfaction with the
advances of our own times.

The earliest record of observed electrolysis dates back of the inven-
tion of Volta’s dry pile and “ crown of cups.” The decomposition
of water by electrical means was described by van Troostwijk
and Deimann in 1789. It was accomplished by sending a series
of electric discharges through water in a narrow glass tube between
gold wires whose ends were an inch and a half apart. The tube was
placed vertically, and when the end of the upper wire became uncoy-
ered the spark caused the explosive reunion of the mixed gases.
These experimenters concluded, contrary to the opinion of many of
their scientific contemporaries, that both the hydrogen and _ the
oxygen were obtained from the decomposition of water and that

water consisted of a union of these two gases only. They cited
both the synthesis and the analysis taking place in their experimental
tube as proofs of their view. But the question as to the manner in
which electricity acts to effect the decomposition remained unan-
swered. They did not obtain the two gases separately, but mixed
in the glass tube. An enormous number of discharges were said
to be necessary to produce an appreciable volume of mixed gases—
14,600 for one-third of a cubic inch.

A little later Ritter found that 50 or 60 discharges from a Leyden
jar through a solution of silver nitrate between silver wires gave
a visible deposit of metallic silver on the negative electrode. By
reversing the poles this deposit disappeared, and at the same time
a new deposit formed on the other wire.

It is therefore obvious that the scientific world was prepared to
accept electrolytic decomposition when Volta disclosed his invention
of the dry pile and the voltaic battery, or “crown of cups.” This
disclosure was made in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, president of
the Royal Society of London, dated March 20, 1800. Before this
letter was published in the Philosophical Transactions its contents
had become known to London physicists, and Nicholson and Carlisle
had decoraposed water by means of Volta’s pile. Carlisle made the
acute observation that when a drop of water was placed on the upper
plate of the pile to improve the contact between it and the wire of
the external circuit, gas was given off; and Nicholson recognized
the presence of hydrogen when the wire used was steel. These and
similar facts induced them to send the electric current from a pile
of 36 pairs through river water between brass wires in a glass tube
half an inch in diameter. A fine stream of gas bubbles was at once
given off from the negative electrode. One-fifteenth of a cubic
inch was obtained in an hour and a half, and when this was mixed
with an equal volume of air the mixture exploded on the approach
of a hghted wax taper.

Although these observers expected the decomposition of water,
they were not prepared for the astonishing fact that, while the
hydrogen appeared at the exposed end of one of the wires, the
oxygen appeared only at the end of the other, nearly 2 inches
distant. This phenomenon was to its discoverers inexplicable. They
made the very relevant and acute remark that this new phenomenon
“appears to show perhaps a general law of the action of electricity
in chemical processes.” The explanation of this remarkable fact
has ever since engaged the attention and best endeavors of science.

It is worthy of attention also that Nicholson and Carlisle observed
that chemical action takes place in a voltaic cell when it functions as
a source of current. In other words, they recognized that a voltaic
cell is also an electrolytic cell. This is the first of many facts which
REVISIONS OF THE THEORY OF ELECTROLYSIS. 149

tell against Volta’s contact theory of the electromotive force of a
voltaic cell. Volta himself asserted that the chemical actions going
on in a voltaic cell have practically no essential significance.

In this same celebrated year of 1800 Cruikshank decomposed lead
acetate between silver wires. A minute or two after connection was
made he observed lustrous metallic lead crystals on the negative
electrode, while gas was released at the positive. Cruikshank called
attention to the fact that only lquids containing oxygen conduct
electricity, and he appears to have concluded that electricity seizes
on the oxygen and transports it invisibly to the positive pole. Not
so far removed from this conception is the present view that the
oxygen conveys an electric charge rather than that the charge con-
veys the oxygen.

The separate appearance of the two products of decomposition at
the electrodes was the most noteworthy, and at the same time the most
inexplicable fact of electrolysis to all the chemists and physicists of
the day. An unknown correspondent in Nicholson’s Journal ex-
pressed himself as follows:

I should like to inquire how it can happen in any system that the two com-
ponents of water can be caused to appear at such a distance from each other.
Does the hydrogen from the dissociated particles of water at the zine side of
the pile fly from it at the instant when the oxygen is liberated there? If that
is so, why does not one see the gas bubbles on the way? Or does the oxygen
migrate from the silver side to the zinc side? Or are there two streams at
once?

It should be remembered that Volta attached an extra zinc plate to
the silver at the positive end and an extra silver plate to the zine at
the negative end, both in the case of his dry pile and crown of cups
or voltaic battery. Hence, in the early literature the zinc side means
the positive and the silver the negative.

Sir Humphry Davy was early in the field of electric research, and at
once distanced all his English confréres by the number and importance
of his detail discoveries. In particular at the outset he obtained oxygen
and hydrogen in different tubes separated in the circuit by the inter-
position of his own person as a conductor, and he proved conclusively
that the two gases are evolved in the same relative proportion in
which they exist as elements in water. But Sir Humphry Davy
added little to the theory of electric action in electrolysis. Near the
close of one of his papers published in December, 1800, he remarks:

On these facts I shall not presume to. speculate * * *. Many obser-
vations must be collected, probably, before we shall be able to ascertain whether
water is decomposed in galvanic processes. Supposing its decomposition, we
must assume that at least one of its elements is capable of rapidly passing in
an invisible form through metallic substances, or through water and many

connected organic bodies, and such an assumption is incommensurable with
all known facts. But a short period has elapsed since philosophers beheld
150 REVISIONS OF THE THEORY OF ELECTROLYSIS.

with wonder solid and fluid substances assuming new modes of existence in
different gases. Do not the new phenomena of galvanism authorize us to
hope that at no very distant time they will behold even those gases undergoing
novel changes and existing in new and now unknown forms?

The diffuseness and lack of concreteness of ideas in those early
days of the science, before the time of Ohm’s law, are strikingly
illustrated in the following extract from a syllabus of a course of
lectures delivered by Davy in the theater of the Royal Institution
in January, 1802:
