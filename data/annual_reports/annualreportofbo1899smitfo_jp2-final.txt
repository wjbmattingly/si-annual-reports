PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

AT THE ANNUAL MEETING HELD JANUARY 25, 1899.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents, adopted Jan-
uary 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present—The Chancellor (Mr. Chief Justice Fuller) in the chair;
the Hon. S. M. Cullom, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon. O. H. Platt,
the Hon. R. R. Hitt, the Hon. John B. Henderson, Dr. William L.
Wilson, Dr. James B. Angell, Dr. A. Graham Bell, and the Secretary,
Mr. 8. P. Langley.

Excuses for nonattendance on account of illness were received from
the Vice-President and Mr. Adams.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion the Secretary read the minutes of the
last meeting in abstract (explaining, in reference to the Board’s author-
ity to use a portion of the Hodgkins fund in his aerodynamic experi-
ments, that he had not used such permission).

There being no objection, the Chancellor declared the minutes
approved. .

The Secretary announced the death of Senator Justin Smith Mor-
rill, and Dr. Wilson offered the following resolutions:

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are called upon to
mourn the death, on December 28, 1898, of Justin Smith Morrill, for fifteen vears a
member of the Board, and to some members of it a still older colleague in the Senate
of the United States:

tesolved, That the Board desire to place on record the expression of their sense of
the exceptional loss they have sustained in the death of their venerable colleague;
and that they unite with their fellow-citizens throughout the land in recognizing the
great services of Senator Morrill to the whole country during a public career of forty-
three years in Congress, where, amid other great national services, his public life in
the special domain of education alone was the most important of that of any single
American. With all these duties his time, his ripened knowledge of practical affairs,
and his counsel were always at the service of the Smithsonian Institution, where no
member of this Board represented its interests in Congress more persistently or more
effectually than he.

Resolved, That by his personal character, no less than by his mental endowments,
he endeared himself to all his associates on this Board, who feel that they have lost
in him, not only a counselor and adviser, but a dear and honored friend; and that,

XI
XII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

without desiring to intrude upon the private grief of his family, they wish to express
to them their share in their sorrow.

Resolved, That this minute be entered as a part of the journal of the Board anda
copy be transmitted to the family of Senator Morrill.

Ex-Senator Henderson said:

I feel a personal loss in the death of Senator Morrill, whom I had known somewhat
intimately from 1862, and with whom I had been associated, more or less, In publie
life, when I was a young man.

He continued: i

Mr. Chancellor, the deceased statesman, Mr. Morrill, is now perfectly secure in
his well-earned fame. It was said by one of the Latin poets that no man should be
esteemed happy before his funeral. In this case the sad rites have been performed,
and to the end of a most useful life he kept the faith.

In his career we have an illustration of the beauty and excellency of our repub-
lican institutions. His education was limited, but his honesty and patriotism had no
bounds. He did what conscience dictated to be done and put his trust in those he
served. He loved, not license, but liberty as defined by Cicero, ‘‘the power to do
what the law permits.’? He was true to his constituents, and in return they gave
him those priceless gifts of freenven—their gratitude and fidelity.

He represented a State small in population and wealth, but rich in the character
of its people and rich in the long line of able, pure, and distinguished statesmen
she has given to the national councils. The horizon of his usefulness, like that of
’ Collamer, Foote, and Edmunds, extended beyond the State of Vermont. He was
broad as the Union itself.

From 1855 to 1867 he was a member of the House of Representatives. In 1861
private industries had become prostrated and bankruptcy threatened the National
Treasury. Secession had already commenced the work of dissolution when he pre-
pared and pressed to enactment the tariff laws of that year. Waiving the question
of protection, the necessity for revenue alone demanded its passage, and the benefi-
cent results gave national reputation to its author. He came to the Senate in
1867, and continued a member of that body until the date of his death, having re-
ceived six successive elections by the legislature of his State. In the Senate he stood
at all times for a sound currency. He had deplored the original issue of United
States notes in 1862, and, true to his convictions of right, in after years he consist-
ently demanded the performance of the nation’s pledge that they be redeemed and
canceled. He believed with all his heart that the gold dollar should measure values
throughout the commercial world, and, unmoved by the clamors of hard times, he
persevered in his faith until the fulfillment of his prophecies has broken the stubborn
unbelief of millions.

Through his efforts the statues of distinguished Americans now adorn the old rep-
resentative hall of the Capitol, where his own so well deserves to be placed.

Largely through his exertions came the building constructed for the State, War,
and Navy Departments, and the last legislative act of his life was to provide a build-
ing for the use of the Supreme Court of the United States. To us who knew him
so well it brings profound pleasure that he lived to see the Library building com-
pleted, which not only in its purposes but in the splendor of its architecture does
honor to the nation. . Somewhere within its walls a modest tablet should at least
connect his name with this magnificent structure. It is no less a monument to his
memory than is St. Paul’s Cathedral to the memory of Sir Christopher Wren.

For the last eighteen years he was a Regent of this Institution, ever watchful of
its interests and prompt to increase its usefulness. In the grandeur of his country
he felt the patriot’s pride. He sought to make its capital city worthy of the people
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIIL

to whom it belonged. And the Smithsonian Institution was regarded by him as a
chief factor in its future greatness and renown.

My acquaintance with Mr. Morrill began in 1862. In my earlier days I enjoyed
his counsel and instruction in public affairs. He was, in my judgment, the true
American nobleman. Here as elsewhere distinction imposes increased obligations—
noblesse oblige. No books of heraldry and no blazoned emblems are necessary to
evidence the rank of Senator Morrill. His patent of nobility is recorded in the hea’ ts
of a grateful people.

Dr. Angell said:

I was for some years president of the University of Vermont, of which Mr. Morrill
was a trustee, and it gives me pleasure to say that during the time of my connection
there, his duties were just as conscientiously and studiously performed for the uni-
versity, small as it was, as they have been for this Institution. I think I can safely
say that no man in the State of Vermont had a stronger hold on the hearts of its
people than he.

The Secretary felt it difficult to speak of one who was to him so dear
and personal a friend, and declined to make any remarks.

Senator Cullom then moved the adoption of the resolutions by a
rising vote, which motion was carried.

The Secretary announced the appointment on January 18, 1899, by
the President of the Senate, of the Hon. O. H. Platt, of Connecticut,
to succeed Senator Morrill, and the election of Dr. J. B. Angell, to
succeed himself, by joint resolution, approved January 24, 1899.

The Secretary presented his annual report of June 30, 1898, remark-
ing that it had already been sent to the Regents, and that he would
only ask them to look at one or two matters; for instance, at the map
opposite page 26, showing the extent of the correspondence which the
Institution had in connection with its exchanges; and he also asked
their further attention to the illustrations in the report showing some
views in the National Zoological Park.

On motion, the report was accepted.

Mr. Henderson then submitted the annual report of the Executive
Committee to June 30, 1898, which, on motion was adopted.

Mr. Henderson offered the following customary resolution relative
to income and expenditure, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1900, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Sec-
retary, with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part
of the Secretary as to items.

Mr. Henderson, as chairman of the Permanent Committee, made
the following statements concerning the Hodgkins and the Avery
bequests:

CONDITION OF THE HODGKINS FUND AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR 1898.

There have been no transactions during the year affecting the status
of the Hodgkins fund, except as shown in the statement of the condi-
’

XIV PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

tion of the fund, and the receipts and disbursements during the year,
contained in the report of the executive committee of the Regents.

CONDITION OF AVERY FUND AT CLOSE OF THE CALENDAR YEAR 1898.

By a decision of the United States Supreme Court the title to cer-
tain real estate on Capitol Hill, owned by Robert Stanton Avery at the
time of his decease, and adversely claimed by the heirs of Mrs. Avery,
has been adjudged to be rightfully in the Smithsonian Institution.
This completes all litigation in connection with the Avery bequest, the
status of which is now entirely settled.

The assessed valuation of the real estate now vesting in the Institu-
tion is $21,086. The Commissioners of the District of Columbia have
during the past year directed the cancellation of certain arrearages of
taxes charged against the property, and have relieved it from future
taxation.

The personal estate is estimated to be worth $2,915.87. It consists
of fifteen shares of stock, one gold bond, and a balance of $85.87
delivered over by Miss Avery in the settlement of her account as
executrix to the National Safe Deposit, Savings and Trust Company,
of Washington City, to be held in accordance with the provisions of

the will of the testator, in trust for Miss Avery during her lifetime,

and upon her demise to become the property of the Institution. The
trust company has been designated as trustee by a decree of the equity
court.

The revenue now derived from this bequest consists solely of the
receipts for rent of real estate, amounting in gross to $606 annually.
From this is to be deducted the cost of repairs, commissions, ete.,
which has lately been at the rate of about $300 annually, leaving a net
revenue of about $300 a year.

Mr. Henderson concluded the report with the remark that the show-
ing illustrated the necessity for the sale of the real estate, as pro-
vided for in the resolution adopted at the last meeting.

On motion, the reports were accepted.

The Secretary then made a statement as to the current affairs of
the Institution under separate heads, a form which he explained he
adopted with the hope that the Regents would express in each case
any opinions they might have for his better instruction.

SECRETARY'S STATEMENT.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The resignation of Mr. Charles D. Walcott as Acting Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution in charge of the National Museum, which was announced at
the last meeting of the Regents, took effect on June 30, 1898. In the report of the
Secretary, now before the Regents, a statement is furnished as to the administrative
changes made in the Museum, by gathering the different departments under three
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

\eade, an arrangement which has rendered the administration of the Museum
.«-/hle without making its oversight an impossible burden upon the Secretary.
iis plan of head curatorships is [he said] for the present working well, but I
=hould prefer to give it another year’s trial before saying that it can be considered
, sui ble plan for the permanent administration of the Museum. In accordance
w+) Lae resolution modifying the terms of the appointment of Mr. Richard Rathbun
4s \-istant Secretary, he has been enabled to aid me in the administration of
Viuse: m affairs.
NEW BUILDING FOR THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

‘),. question of an additional building for the National Museum is one which has
frequently referred to, and which, I may remind the Regents, had the very
oec) | sympathy of their departed colleague, Senator Morrill.

VY)» present building was erected at an entire cost of $315,006. It has an exhibi-
don space of 96,000 square feet, and is the cheapest building of its size ever erected
for . useum purposes.

{2 growth of the Museum is extraordinary, when the mere number of specimens

-  ysidered without reference to their arrangement or value. Before the present
\lieseum building was fairly completed, it was found inadequate to hoiding all the

Jicetions, then numbering between one and two millions, and a considerable part

-s remained in the Smithsonian building, which was built entirely at the private
«<¢ of the Smithson fund, and which the Government has continued to use up to
jhe present time, rent free, by the permission of the Regents, for this purpose.

There are now between four and five million specimens, occupying a floor space
which is only adequate for one-third of that number, and the rate of increase is itself
‘yereasing by bounds, more than 400,000 specimens haying been added during the

v

past year.

[his great increase is not, however, cause for unmixed congratulation, for while
« me of the recent additions represent collections complete in themselves, as a whole

ey are not readily assimilable. They were not asa rule selected by the donors on

iy deliberate system, but are separate and unrelated gifts, too valuable in themselves
wr the Government to refuse, but which must be joined under some system, and can
ot be effectively used unless means are provided to fill the gaps between them by
purchase, and make them continuous.

With some notable exceptions, then, the increase of collections is im the direction
of a miscellaneous and fragmentary mass, which can only be fully developed and co-
ordinated by purchases to fill the gaps, and there are almost no means for such
purchases.

Although the Museum is now so congested that the contents are rather packed
than displayed, it must not be supposed that the lack of space is the only imperative
demand. Unless some additional means are provided by Congress for unifying these
collections, I feel it my duty to state to the Regents that, even without reference to
the building question, the Museum under their charge, which is still in the front of
such American institutions, can not longer remain so.

The need of a new building is one quite apart from any enlargement in scope or
future development, though questions of that nature are also presenting themselves
for solution. Among these I may mention the very earnest recommendation of Mr.
Walcott for a Museum of Practical Geology, the demand for which, he tells me, is
every day becoming stronger.

I have laid these needs of the Museum before the Board thus briefly, to invite
an expression of opinion as to whether the time is opportune for presenting them
to Congress, and if so, to especially invite the help of the Regents in their accom-
plishment.
XVI PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. —

A discussion here arose, participated in by the Chancellor, Senators>
Platt and Quay, Mr. Hitt, and Mr. Henderson. In answer to ques-
tions, the Secretary explained the apparent anomaly of asking money to
purchase collections at a time when the Museum had not space to pro-
' vide for those it possessed, and he asked the Senatorial Regents to
consider the desirability of interesting the Senate Appropriations Com:
mittee in some matters which the House committee had not apparently
adequately considered. He named $25,000 as the lowest sum which it
was desirable to have in addition to the $165,000 on the appropriation
for preservation of collections.

The Secretary spoke of the attitude of Congress with regard to sal-
aries in the Institution, and Mr. Hitt explained that the attitude of the
Appropriations Committee with regard to all requests for salaries was
due to the fact that experience had shown in the immense majority of
cases that these requests had a personal motive. He thought it was
to be regretted that those of the Institution were not discriminated
from such a class, as they seemed to deserve.

Remarks to the same effect were made by other Regents, and the
result of the discussion seemed to be a general expression of feeling
among the Regents that the appointments by the Institution had been
so markedly free from political or personal influence, that it was much
to be desired that Congress should appreciate the fact and recognize it
in reposing a larger confidence in the management of the Institution
where the salaries were in question.

EXPLORATIONS OF NEW TERRITORY.

The Secretary proceeded:

Eyer since there seemed to be a possibility of acquiring new territory as a result
of the late Spanish-American war, I have had in mind the advisability and propriety
of the sending out by the Institution of scientific parties under its various bureaus
to conduct inquiries as to the natural history, geology, ethnology, archeology, and
scientific activities of these countries. I understand that the political results of the
war are not so thoroughly determined as to make this an opportune time to take

the question up, but I hope that by next year Congress will be prepared to consider
the matter and to listen to definite proposals concerning it.

COOPERATION OF NAVY AND ARMY IN COLLECTING ANIMALS FOR THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK.
> ’

The law establishing the Zoological Park states: ‘‘That the heads of the Executive
Departments of the Government are hereby authorized and directed to cause to be
rendered the necessary and practicable aid to the said Regents in the acquisition of
collections in the Zoological Park.’’

I have this year addressed letters to the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the —
Navy, asking if it would meet their approval if letters were addressed to officers ol | zh
the Army and Navy asking them to cooperate in this work. I have received
response to this a cordial reply from the Secretary of the Navy assenting to this

prope sition,
3 3
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XVII

The Secretary gave an account of the experiments in aérodromics
which are being conducted for the Board of Ordnance and Fortifica-
tion, War Department.

Some general remarks were made by the Regents, among others by
Mr. Bell, who said that he had been a witness of these experiments,
which the Secretary had raised to a scientific plane. He was gratified
by the action of the War Department, and by the prospect of the
useful application of the principles established.

The Chancellor remarked that the Board was now fully informed as
to what the Secretary wished, and he presumed their assent would be
understood to be given without the need of a formal resolution.

HODGKINS MEDAL.

The Secretary continued:

While it does not seem advisable that the Hodgkins fund should be chiefly
employed in giving medals, it was unquestionably the wish of its founder that it
should be thus used to some extent, at least in the early years of its administration,
and I have, after consulting scientific counsel, concluded to, with the sanction of the
Regents, bestow the gold medal of the Institution on Prof. James Dewar, of the
Royal Institution, for his researches on the solidification of atmospheric air, and
useful discoveries in that connection.

The Secretary added his regret that this gold medal, which was

“ to} > y
being struck at the Paris mint, had not arrived in time to be shown to
the Regents. He exhibited some other gold medals, one of them by
the same medalist, and answered the questions of the Regents about
them.

LAW PROTECTING ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES.

The Secretary stated that as time was pressing, he would not read at
length the form of proposed laws for protecting archeological sites
and for preventing the forgery of antiquities, but that since the reso-
lution he had to present in no way committed the Regents to any-
thing further than an expression of opinion that some such legislation
was desirable, he would simply submit the resolution, as follows,
which, on motion, was adopted:

Resolved, That the Board approves in principle the passage of laws protecting
archzeological sites and making the uttering of forged objects a misdemeanor, and
that the Regents in Congress be requested to endeavor to secure the passage of
suitable laws covering these matters.

CIVIL SERVICE,

The Secretary went on to say—

At their last meeting the Board of Regents resolved:

That the Secretary be instructed to request of the President such a modification of
the civil service regulations relating to appointments as will permit an exemption of
such scientific positions under the Smithsonian Institution as the Secretary may
deem best for the interests of the Institution,

SM JY II

AVIII PROCZEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Ghenccllor said that the President had the matter under advise
ment. He knew the general tenor of what the Board desired, and he
(the Chancellor) assumed that the matter would be taken up in order,
7 Senator Platt here remarked that he had reason to believe that the
President would not issue such an order until after the adjournment of
the present Congress. |

NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

After some further explanations to the Board, the Secretary went
on to say that he had reserved until the close a subject on which it
would seem necessary for the Regents to adjudicate with full deliber-
ation.

He referred to the projects for a National University, and speaking
in particular of those which sought directly to enlist the aid of the
Smithsonian Institution in their plans, he said that while all the classes
seemed desirous to obtain this aid, it was specially sought by those
connected with the agricultural and State colleges, directly brought
into existence by the Government.

He then read a letter from Mr. George E. MacLean, the secretary
of the committee on graduate study at Washington of the American
Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, and
presented with it a report describing clearly the wishes of the appli-
cants and requesting that Congress should be asked to make an annual
appropriation of at least $25,000 for their purposes.

The Secretary said he would not read his reply, which was in sub-
stance that he could not act on such a matter without asking the
instructions of the Regents. He had promised to lay the whole matter
before them, which he now did.

This led to a very full discussion among the Regents, and after.
vemarks by the Chancellor. and other members of the Board, Senator
Henderson offered the following resolution, whose form he under-
stood to have been arranged by his colleagues on the executive com-
nittee, Dr. Bell and Dr. Wilson, together with the Secretary, the
latter having, at his own request, been excused from service with the
proposed co.amittee:

Resolved, That the communication from the committee representing the agricultural
colleges of the United States be referred to a committee of Regents, to be appointed
by the Chancellor to consider thé same and all kindred questions, and to make a
report thereon at the next meeting of the Board.

The Chancellor announced the committee as follows: Mr. Hender-
son, Dr. Wilson. Mr. Bell, Dr. Angell, and Mr. Hitt.

There being no further business to come before the Board, on
motion it adjourned,
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

one, to fittingly illustrate the marvelous development of the Western
Hemisphere during the nineteenth century, by a display of the arts,
industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mines, and sea; and |

Whereas the proposed Pan-American Exposition, being confined to
the Western Hemisphere, and being held in the near vicinity of the
great Niagara cataract, within a day’s journey of which reside forty
area people, would unquestionably be of vast benefit to the com-
mercial interests, not only of this country, but of the entire hemis-
phere, and should therefore have e'the sanction of the Congress of the
United States; and

Whereas satisfactory assurances have already been given by the
diplomatic representatives of Canada, Mexico, the Central and South
American Republics, and most of the States of the United States that
these countries and States will make unique, interesting, and instruc-
tive exhibits peculiarly illustrative of their material progress during
the century about to close; and

Whereas no exposition of a similar character as that proposed has
ever been held in the great State of New York; and

Whereas the Pan-American Exposition Company has undertaken to
hold such exposition, beginning on the first day of May, nineteen
hundred and one, and closing on the first day of November, nineteen
hundred and one: Therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That all articles that shall be

said exposition upon which there shall be a tariff or customs duty shall
be admitted free of payment of duty, customs fees, or charges, under

of import duties as the Secretary of the Treasury shall jrescribe: Pro-
vided, That all such articles when sold or withdrawn for consumption
in the United States shall be subject to the duty, if any, imposed upon

the persons who may be guilty of any illegal sale or withdrawal: And
provided further, That all necessary expenses incurred in carrying out
the provisions of this section, including salaries of customs officials in
charge of imported articles, shall be paid to the Treasury of the United

trate the function and administrative faculty of the Government in time
of peace, and its resources as a war power, and its relations to other
American Republics, tending to demonstrate the nature of our insti-
tutions and their adaption to the wants of the people. And to secure a
complete and harmonious arrangement of such Government exhibit, a
board of management shall be created, to be charged with the selection,
purchase, preparation, transportation, arrangement, safe-keeping, exhi-
bition, and return of such articles and materials as the heads of the
several Departments and the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,

Ph AR Y OF THE SMEPasSONTAN INSTITULION ;

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1899,

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith my customary
report, showing the operations of the Institution during the year end-
ing June 30, 1899, including the work placed under its direction by
Congress in the U. S. National Museum, the Bureau of American
Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park,
and the Astrophysical Observatory.

Following the precedent of several years, I have in the body of this
report given a general account of the affairs of the Institution and its
bureaus, while the appendix presents more detailed statements by the
persons in direct charge of the different branches of the work. Inde-
pendently of this, the operations of the National Museum are fully
treated in a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report, and the report
of the work of the Bureau of American Ethnology constitutes a vol-
ume prepared under the supervision of the Director of that Bureau.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

I have to record two changes in the membership of the Establish-
ment during the year, caused by the resignation of the Secretary of
State, William R. Day, and the Secretary of the Interior, Cornelius
N. Bliss, who were succeeded by the Hon. John Hay and the Hon.

1
sm 99——1
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

E. A. Hitchcock. As organized at the end of the fiscal year, th
Establishment consisted of the following ex officio members.

Wituram McKinuiey, President of the United States.
Garrer A. Hopart, Vice-President of the United States.
Metvintte W. Fuiier, Chief Justice of the United States.
Joun Hay, Secretary of State.

Lyman J. Gaan, Secretary of the Treasury.

RussELL A. ALGER, Secretary of War.

Joun W. Grices, Attorney-General.

CHARLES Emory Smitu, Postmaster- General.

Joun D. Lone, Secretary of the Navy.

E. A. Hirencock, Secretary of the Interior.

James Witson, Secretary of Agriculture.

The Establishment, which formerly held occasional meetings, has
not been assembled for some time.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 25, 1899, at 10
o'clock a. m. The journal of its proceedings will be found, as hitherto,
in the annual report of the Board to Congress, though reference is
made later on in this report to several matters upon which action was
taken at that meeting.

The Secretary announced the death of the Hon. Justin S. Morrill,
and after appropriate remarks by several of the Regents, the follow-
ing resolutions were adopted by a rising vote.

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are
called upon to mourn the death, on December 28, 1898, of Justin
Smith Morrill, for fifteen years a member of the Board, and to some
members of it a still older colleague in the Senate of the United
States:

Lesolwed, That the Board desire to place on record the expression
of their sense of the exceptional loss they have sustained in the death
of their venerable colleague; and that they unite with their fellow-
citizens throughout the land in recognizing the great services of
Senator Morrill to the whole country during a public career of forty-
three years in Congress, where, amid other great national services, his
public life in the special domain of education alone was the most
important of that of any single American. With all these duties, his
time, his ripened knowledge of practical affairs, and his counsel, were
always at the service of the Smithsonian Institution, where no mem-
ber of this Board represented its interests in Congress more persist-
ently or more effectually than he.

Resolved, That by his personal character, no less than by his mental
endowments, he endeared himsclf to all his associates on this Board,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

who feel that they have lost in him, not only a counselor and adviser,
but a dear and honored friend; and that without desiring to intrude
upon the private grief of his family, they wish to express to them
their share in their sorrow.

Resolved, That this minute be entered as a part of the journal of
the Board and a copy be transmitted to the family of Senator Morrill.

Further mention of Senator Morrill will be found in the necrology.

On January 18, 1899, Senator O. H. Platt, of Connecticut, was
appointed a Regent by the President of the Senate to succeed Senator
Morrill. Dr. J. B. Angell, of Michigan, was reappointed a Regent by a
joint resolution of Congress, approved by the President January 24,
1899.

The Secretary’s report and the reports of various committees were
submitted, the Secretary mentioning among other matters of interest
the need of a systematic exploration of new territories, the cooperation
of the Army and Navy in securing animals for the National Zoological
Park, the aerodromie work in cooperation with the War Department,
and the necessity of a law protecting sites on the public domain con-
taining aboriginal ruins.

The question of the relation of the Smithsonian Institution to the
proposed National University, was referred to a committee composed
of the Hon. J. B. Henderson, Dr. W. L. Wilson, Dr. A. Graham Bell,
Dr. J. B. Angell, and the Hon. R. R. Hitt.

Since the meeting of the Board, Senator William Lindsay, of Ken-
tucky, was, on March 3, 1899, appointed by the President of the Senate
a Regent to succeed Senator Gray, whose term as Senator had expired.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The operations of the Institution are constantly on the increase,
but while it is impossible to give an idea in brief of their extent and
variety, it may not be superfluous to at least indicate them in a few
words. The parent institution devotes itself to its primary functions —
of ‘‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge” along the lines of its
original programme, adopted by the Board of Regents in 1847 and
reenacted by them in 1851, interpreting the establishing act.

The ‘‘increase” is advanced by researches now being actively pro-
moted in nearly every department of knowledge by its own officials,
by their preparation of results for publication, and by grants to special
investigators and explorers, by administering legacies for scientific
ends, furnishing information and advice, and in like ways. These,
the original functions of the Institution, are performed primarily out
of the income of the Smithsonian fund and other private funds, with
a comparatively small force, which is yet independently busied in the
supervision of researches carried on in the Institution’s bureaus, under
governmental appropriations directed by it.
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Through the National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the
National Zoological Park, and the Astrophysical Observatory, re-
searches are promoted in all the branches of natural history, zoology,
anthropology, and astro-physics, both by the opportunities afforded
in Washington and by aid given students elsewhere.

In furtherance of its second function in the ‘‘ diffusion” of knowl-
edge the Institution issues and freely distributes three classes of
publications: Original memoirs, useful scientific publications, and
popular expositions of scientific work and thought, in untechnical lan-
guage, prepared by eminent scholars and thinkers.

Nor is the instruction of the people forgotten, since, through the
museum and park, great object lessons are placed before the hundreds
of thousands of visitors to the national capital from all parts of the
United States. The pupils in the public schools of Washington benefit
greatly by these opportunities. It has become a part of their routine
to visit, under the care of a teacher, the Smithsonian Institution and
National Museum buildings, as well as the park; while those outside
the city benefit indirectly through the numerous excursions of teachers
and the stimulus and suggestion they may thus receive.

Perhaps unique as an agency in promotion of scientific and literary
relationships abroad is the exchange service, which facilitates inter-
course between governmental and learned societies and institutions
and scientific men, and which, as is stated later, now has 31,000 corre-
spondents, of whom more than 20,000 are in Europe and Asia.

Standing near the threshold of the second half century of the Insti-
tution’s life, it is plain to see how scientific conditions have changed,
and easier to estimate the relative position which the Institution
holds toward American and foreign scientific endeavor. The most
noteworthy fact is the much greater esteem in which American science
is held abroad, the better knowledge had of its representatives, and
the more friendly and even intimate relations between American
workers and their foreign colleagues. To this end it may unquestion-
ably be said that the Institution has contributed a very large share,
and that its influence abroad has so notably increased within the past
ten years, as to constitute a very gratifying fact.

Its relations with Government and with the leading academies are
close and friendly, and in accordance with its motto ‘‘ PER ORBEM” its
encouragement of research is as freely extended to students in England
and on the Continent of Europe, or anywhere else, as to those within
the United States. The great part which scientific thought and activity
are playing in the world to-day has partially contributed to this con-
dition, and the recognition of the Institution by our own Department
of State as the adviser in matters relating to international science has
ereatly contributed to this end.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

It is clear that American science is almost incomparably stronger
than it was fifty years ago. With rich endowments for learned
societies, museums, and universities, and vastly augmented avenues
for scientific publication, American investigators no longer have the
need of the Institution for purposes of publication, as in times past,
and its most friendly relations to our great colleges and universities
are more those of an intermediary for their communications abroad
than in any other capacity.

I wish that these relations may grow still more intimate and be still
more helpful in promoting the common cause. When the changed con-
ditions alluded to are fully appreciated, and the differentiation which
those conditions make necessary fully understood, new methods for
promoting the highest research by friendly arrangement will undoubt-
edly arise in this country.

ADMINISTRATION.

The writer continues to be chiefly occupied with purely adminis-
trative duties, though certain important ones connected more particu-
larly with the interests of science consume a minor part of his time.

In the administration of the various bureaus placed by the Govern-
ment under the direction of the Institution there continues to be ¢
greatly increasing amount of business that must be transacted in the
Secretary’s office, and it has been found necessary during the year to
provide additional assistance to attend to the increasing correspondence
pertaining directly to these and to legislative and civil service matters;
but though the Secretary has already been authorized by the Board
to call upon Congress for a special appropriation for the organization
of a force for the general administrative work of the bureaus, he
can only refer to what has been said on this point in previous reports,
and especially in that for 1897, and add an expression of his regret
that Congress has as yet done nothing to relieve the Institution’s fund
of the burdens thus laid upon it for the support of purely Govern-
ment interests.

FINANCES.

The permanent funds of the Institution are as follows:

6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Regents also hold certain approved railroad bonds, forming part
of the fund established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations of the
properties of atmospheric air.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, the fun-
damental act organizing the Institution, as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding with the original bequest the sum of $1,000,000:
Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by
gift, bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in pro.
motion of the purposes thereof.

Under this provision the above fund of $912,000 is deposited in the |
Treasury of the United States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per
annum, the interest alone being used in carrying out the aims of the
Institution.

The unexpended balance at the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1,
1898, as stated in my last annual report, was $65,803.02. The fotal
receipts for the year were $66,023.60, being $56,400 derived from the
interest on the permanent fund in the Treasury and elsewhere, and
$9,623.60, received from miscellaneous sources.

The disbursements for the year amounted to $57,123.20, the details
of which are given in the report of the executive committee. The
balance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1899, for
the expenses of the Institution was $74,703.42, which, it will be remem-
bered, includes $10,000 referred to in previous reports, $5,000 of which
was received from the estate of Dr. J. H. Kidder, and a like sum from
Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the latter a gift made personally to the
Secretary to promote certain physical researches. This latter sum
was, with the donor’s consent, deposited by the Secretary to the credit
of the current funds of the Institution.

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
and other funds, which is held against certain contingent obligations,
besides relatively considerable sums held to meet obligations which
may be expected to mature as a result of various scientific investiga-
tions and publications in progress.

During the fiscal year 1898-99 Congress charged the Institution
with the disbursement of the following appropriations:

The executive committee has examined all the vouchers for dis-
bursements made during the fiscal year, and a detailed statement of
the receipts and expenditures will be found reported to Congress, in
accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of October 2,
1888, and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published,
together with the accounts of the fund appropriated by Congress, in
that committee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian
Institution and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury
were as follows:

BUILDINGS.

I have set aside a small room in the Institution’s building, in the
south tower; have had some alterations made, with a view to increas-
ing its light and cheerfulness, and am having plans prepared for the
purpose of bringing together there, in a simple and attractive manner,
objects which may be of interest to children. This small collection,
I hope, may serve a double purpose—that of interesting the child’s
mind to the point of inquisitiveness which finally results in study, and
to the setting of an example which may cause such little collections,
and, possibly, even larger ones, arranged especially for children, to
grow up in other sections of the country.

The Regents’ room on the second floor has been partially renovated,
anda room in the half story below has been fitted for the care of the
valuable collection of physical apparatus used by Professor Henry and
others in various investigations.

The hall devoted to the bird collection has been rendered lighter by
the rearrangement of exhibition cases and by replacing the wooden
floor by terrazzo pavement. In the hallway of the east basement a
cement pavement has been laid and the heating apparatus rearranged.

The electric plant installed in the building some years ago was at
the time considered ample for the needs of the Institution, but during
the past year it became necessary to secure a large increase of power,
and this was finally secured by taking service from the local electric
light and power company, and the operation of the plant in the Insti-
tution has been discontinued for the present.

Improvements in the Museum, Astrophysical Observatory, and
Zoological Park buildings are mentioned elsewhere.

RESEARCH.

One of the most important functions of the Institution during the
half century of its existence has been the promotion of original
research in the various branches of science. It is so now, and investi-
gations of great benefit have continued to be carried on by persons
directly connected with the Institution or by others aided by special
grants.

In this connection the parent Institution has found it possible to con-
tinue to render aid to investigations through the Hodgkins fund, as
mentioned somewhat in detail below, and it has also continued the
rental of a table at the Naples Zoological Station, where certain biolog-
ical researches have been conducted.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

The Secretary has pursued his studies in regard to aerodromic exper-
iments, and an account of many years’ investigation of this subject
has been prepared and is nearly ready for the press, but publication is
_ deferred for a time. é

The Institution subscribed for a considerable number of copies of
the Astronomical Journal and the Astrophysical Journal for distribu-
tion in the general interest of the diffusion of knowledge.

The National Museum has been concerned in investigations relating
to anthropology, biology, and geology, and the Bureau of American
Ethnology has devoted its energies to inquiries into aboriginal cus-
toms and languages, while in the Astrophysical Observatory the Sec-
retary himself has continued his researches in connection with the
spectrum and solar radiation. The results of these several lines of
investigation are mentioned in the paragraphs devoted to those
bureaus or in the appendix to this report in detailed statements of
those in charge of the work.

HODGKINS FUND.

Since the last Report the Hodgkins memoir, ‘*‘ La Vie sur les hauts
Plateaux,” submitted in collaboration by Prof. A. L. Herrera and Dr.
D. Vergara Lope, of the City of Mexico, has been published in French
by the authors, and a considerable number of copies was secured by
the Institution for distribution to some of the principal libraries of the
country. This memoir, which was designated by the committee for
honorable mention, with silver medal, appears as a timely contribu-
tion to our knowledge of the atmosphere in connection with the wel-
fare of man.

As mentioned in last year’s Report, a memoir embodying the results
of a research to determine the ratios of specific heats, prosecuted by
Drs. Lummer and Pringsheim under a grant from the Hodgkins fund,
has been published in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge
and distributed in accordance with the established custom of the Insti-
tution. This important investigation is to be continued under the
direction of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, of Berlin, with
which establishment Drs. Lummer and Pringsheim are connected.

Although necessarily limited in number by the conditions of the
bequest, the investigations now in progress under grants from the
Hodgkins fund are reported as making satisfactory advance along
their special lines of research, among which the progress in the inyes-
tigations of the higher regions of the atmosphere, made at the Blue Hill
Meteorological Observatory by means of kites ascending vertically
between 2 and 3 miles, are to be specifically mentioned. )

An additional grant of $500 to Mr. A. Lawrence Rotch, the director,
was approved May 4, 1899, for a series of experiments in wireless
telegraphy by the use of kites at varying altitudes, a part of this sum
being for the purchase of apparatus, which on the termination of the
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

research will remain the property of the Institution. Prof. E. C.
Pickering, of Harvard University Observatory, while unable to give
his personal attention to the details of the investigation, furthered its
inception by valuable suggestions as to the electrical. part of the
experiments.

The meteorological experiments at Blue Hill, just alluded to, and
which are circumstantially described by Mr. Rotch, the director, in
his printed bulletins, have been steadily progressing, aided, as before
stated, by a Hodgkins grant.

On February 12, 1899, one of the automatic kites sent up from the
station reached the height of 12,507 feet, or nearly 24 miles, making
the highest ascension on record. As a proof that the increased height
of this flight is due to improved apparatus and methods, rather than to
some fortunate combination of air currents at the time, it may be added
that the average height of five flights made at Blue Hill between Feb-
ruary 23 and 28 of the same year was about 10,280 feet, this average
being only 806 feet less than the highest single flight ever attained
previous to that of February 12, 1899.

It has been found at the Blue Hill Observatory that the exposure of |

the instruments carried by kites is probably equal to that of instru-
ments at the ground, and the results have so far proved more satis-
factory than those recorded by instruments carried by balloons. The
stationary position of the kites, as opposed to the motion of free bal-
loons with the atmospheric currents, also renders possible a record of
the progressive changes of the atmosphere, as well as a comparison of
similar coincident phenomena at a fixed point on the surface of the
sarth. Kites can, moreover, reach higher altitudes than captive bal-
loons have yet attained, and are better fitted to withstand the wind
velocities to be encountered at great heights. Experiments are still
in progress, and it is hoped that a union of the two methods of explor-
ing the atmosphere—by means of kites and by captive balloons—may
eventually give better results than any yet attained by either method
alone.
It may be noted that Mr. William A. Eddy, who experimented, by
the aid of a small grant from the Hodgkins fund, in 1894 at Bayonne,
New Jersey, was the first to demonstrate the adaptability of a modern
kite of his own device to the purposes of scientific experiment.

The investigation on the intensity of sound, conducted by Prof.
A. G. Webster, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass., is reported
as making satisfactory progress. It is expected that by means of the
new instrument designed by Professor Webster an absolute measure
of the intensity of a sound, even when rapidly varying, will be
recorded with an accuracy not hitherto attained.

Extended researches upon the propagation, reflection, and diffrac-
tion of sound are in progress, and results of much practical value are
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Jia

looked for from experiments in connection with the action of the
megaphone and phonograph, and in verification of the general theory
of resonators.

The research noted in my last report, by Prof. William Hallock, of
Columbia University, New York, having for its object the complete
analysis of a particle of air under the influence of articulate sounds, is
still in progress and has been reported upon in detail, so far as com-
pleted. It is believed that this investigation will yield broader results
than were, perhaps, anticipated, and that the experiments of Professor
Hallock in connection with the synthesis of sound by means of magnetic
induction and the telephone, which are largely conducted by means of
a tone synthesizer of his own invention, will help to solve questions of
the greatest importance, not only in reference to the motion of air in
articulate speech, but also in phonetics in general.

It having been proposed by Prof. L. A. Bauer, the editor of the
periodical entitled ‘‘Terrestial Magnetism,” to extend its scope to
include ‘‘Atmospheric Electricity,” his request for a grant from the
Hodgkins fund was considered and referred to specialists distinguished
for their researches in connection with the subjects treated of in that
publication. A grant having been heartily recommended, wasapproved
for the sum of $200, and the title of the journal was changed to ‘‘Ter-
restrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity.” To further as effec-
tively as possible in this instance the aim of the Institution in dispensing
the fund, Professor Bauer offered, as a recognition of this grant, to
send one hundred copies of the periodical of which he is the editor to
a list of educational and scientific establishments approved by the Insti-
tution. This action is the more gratifying as it is known that efforts
for the advancement of our knowledge of the subject of atmospheric
electricity are entirely consonant with the wishes of the founder of the
Hodgkins fund.

Coincidentally with the publication of the Hodgkins prize competi-
tion the establishment of the Hodgkins medal of the Smithsonian
Institution was announced, to be awarded only for exceptionally im-
portant contributions to our knowledge of the nature and properties
of atmospheric air, or for original and practical applications of exist-
ing knowledge to the welfare of mankind.

The advisory committee, after giving the subject special considera-
tion, in December, 1898, recommended the award of the medal to
‘Prof. James Dewar, of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, for
his meritorious researches on the liquefaction and solidification of
atmospheric air, for his investigations of the physical properties of
substances in contact with liquid air, and for his discovery of the
extraordinary magnetic properties of liquid oxygen.

In accordance with the recommendation of the committee, the first
Hodgkins gold medal of the Smithsonian Institution was awarded to
hee REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Professor Dewar, to whom, by the courtesy of the Department of
State, it was conveyed through the American ambassador in London,
in April, 1899.

NAPLES TABLE,

The following applications for the seat at the Smithsonian table in
the Naples Zoological Station were approved for the year ending with
June, 1899:

Dr. J. H. Gerould, of Dartmouth College, whose appointment to
the table dated from November 1, 1898, remained in occupation until
the end of February, 1899.

Dr. F. W. Bancroft received an appointment for the period from
March 1 to July 1, 1899, going to the station from the University of
Berlin, where he had been studying under a traveling fellowship from
Harvard University.

During the absence in Europe of Prof. E. B. Wilson, of Columbia
University, New York, who represents the Society of American Natu-
ralists on the Naples table advisory committee, his duties were courte-
ously assumed by Dr. T. H. Morgan, of Bryn Mawr, who will be
remembered as an early appointee to the station. Dr. Wilson has
been a valued member of the advisory committee since its formation,
and it was a pleasure to approve his application for the Smithsonian
seat for three months during the summer of 1899.

The occupation of the Smithsonian table during the past year has
been equivalent to the time of one student for ten months, or the full
annual period for which it is practicable to study at Naples.

With the exception of the time covered by the absence of Dr. Wilson,
the personnel of the advisory committee has remained unchanged since
my last report. I have again to record my appreciation of the efficient
aid afforded me by the committee in examining applications and recom-
mending action in connection with appointments to the table.

The continued courtesy of Dr. Dohrn, the director of the station,
in arranging for the accommodation of all the Smithsonian appointees,
when two, or even three, have desired to be at Naples at the same time,
has frequently been of advantage to students, who, being prevented .
by their engagements at other institutions from reaching Naples on
the date fixed for their reception, would otherwise have been deprived
of a part of the period allotted to them by the Institution.

‘The lease of the seat in the Naples station on behalf of the Institu-
tion for the second term of three years expired June 1, 1899. A con-
tract for a third term has not yet been concluded, but the urgent desire
of the leading biologists of the country that the Institution should con-
tinue to afford this undoubted advantage to our investigators will
receive due consideration in reaching a decision.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. is

EXPLORATIONS.

As in past years a large amount of exploration work has been accom-
plished by the Institution through the National Museum and the
Bureau of Ethnology, particularly in anthropological and natural his-
tory lines, detailed accounts of which are given in the appendix.

It was expected that Congress would make provision for extended
explorations in the new possessions acquired as a result of the war
with Spain, but the time seemed inopportune for general work. It
was found possible, however, to make limited investigations in Puerto
Rico partly through the cooperation of the Commissioner of Fish and
Fisheries.

It seems important that I should repeat my recommendation of last
year in regard to the new regions, that not only for practical purposes,
but as a contribution to the general intelligence of mankind, the Goy-
ernment should institute scientific inquiry as to the natural history,
geology, geography, ethnology, archeology, and scientific utilities of
any new possessions. ‘These inquiries should be made coherently and
harmoniously on the part of the various Government interests involved.

In April, 1899, the Institution communicated with the Secretary of
the Navy in regard to the Island of Guam, a new possession of the
United States, and the commander of the U. 8. 8. Yosemite was given
instructions about collecting ethnological, zoological, and natural his-
tory specimens in that region.

The attention of the Institution having been called to the probability
of obtaining valuable archeological information through the diplo-
matic and consular representatives of the United States in Canada,
Central America, and South America, the Department of State issued
the following circular:

ANTIQUARIAN DISCOVERIES.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
. Washington, February 15, 1899.
To the Diplomatic and Consular Officers of the United States in Cen-
tral and South America and Mexico, and the Consular Officers in
Canada.

GENTLEMEN: In view of the interests of anthropological science,
and the probability that, without systematic plans for gathering such
information, important antiquarian discoveries may escape the notice
of American investigators, you are requested to ascertain and to report
to the Department any discoveries of this character that may be made
in your district.

In making such reports you will forward copies of any original nar-
rations or descriptions that may be available.

These reports are called for at the suggestion of the Smithsonian
Institution in a letter of the 1st instant, which is appended hereto.

Iam, gentlemen, your obedient servant,

THomas W. CrIDLER,
Third Assistant Secretary.
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, U. S. A., February 1, 1899.

Str: In reply to the letter of the Department of the 12th ultimo,
inclosing copies of letters from Mr. Whitelaw Reid and the Duke de
Loubat, suggesting that the diplomatic and consular officers in Mexico
and Central and South America be given instructions to report any
antiquarian discoveries that may be made within their districts, and
soliciting my view on the subject, I beg to say that our knowledge of
the American aborigines could be materially advanced if such instruc-
tion were sent to diplomatic and consular representatives in Mexico,
Central America, South America, the Dominion of Canada, and New-
foundland, and if the data thus obtained were communicated to the
Smithsonian Institution 1t would be referred to the proper bureau
there and would be brought to the attention of scientific men.

I am informed that in Mexico and certain of the Central American
countries, where Government offices exist for the direction of antiqui-
ties, the securing of this information would be a comparatively simple
matter.

Very respectfully yours, S. P, Lane ry,
Secretary.
The SECRETARY OF STATE.

PUBLICATIONS.

It has been chiefly through the medium of its publications that the
Institution has aimed to fulfill the expressed wish of its founder for
‘*the diffusion of knowledge.”

The results of original researches have thus been made known by a
wide and general distribution of scientific works to libraries and insti- ©
tutions of learning throughout the world, every branch of human
knowledge being represented to a greater or less degree in the 250 or
more volumes published by the Institution and its bureaus during the
last fifty years, while as each year’s additions are made to the several
series of works they become more and more important as a library of
valued reference. Many of the earlier volumes are out of print, so that
it is impossible to comply with requests for the full series where new
libraries are added to the lists. The editions of each series have from
time to time been increased as far as the income of the. Institution or
the Government appropriation would permit; but the increase can not
keep pace with the growing demand for the publications. By a judi-
cious geographical distribution, the aim has been to place the books
in libraries where they may be accessible to all who desire to consult
them. :

During the year there have been added to the miscellaneous collec-
tions three works—a supplement to the Bibliography of Chemistry, an
index to the Literature of Thallium, and an index to the Literature of
Zirconium.

The Annual Reports of the Institution for 1896 and 1897, which had
been unavoidably delayed beyond the close of the last fiscal year by
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

necessary printing in connection with the war with Spain, were issued
during the current year, and some progress was made on the Report
for 1898.

The Museum volume of the 1896 Report of the Institution was
likewise distributed, and although much progress was made in the
1897 and 1898 volumes, it was not possible to complete them before
the close of the fiscal year.

Of publications of the National Museum there appeared volume
20 of the Proceedings and pamphlet copies of papers to comprise
volume 21 of that series. Two additional volumes, parts 2 and 3 of
Jordan and Evermann’s Fishes of North and Middle America, were
also published.

The Secretary, remembering that Congress in the fundamental act
had authorized him to call on heads of departments in the interests
of the Zoological Park, issued a pamphlet entitled ‘*Animals desired
for the National Zoological Park at Washington, D. C.,” which was
distributed chiefly to diplomatic and army and navy officers of the
United States, through the courtesy of the Secretaries of State, War,
and Navy. This, which will be spoken of more fully in another place,
promises very good results through the interest already shown in the
object by the officers in question.

The 1898 Report of the American Historical Association was trans-
mitted to Congress in the spring of 1899, and much of it was in type
before July 1.

In accordance with the act of incorporation of the National Society
of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Secretary transmitted
to Congress the first report of that society, and the work was printed
as a public document, no copies, however, being made available for
distribution by the Institution.

The manuscript of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory,
Volume I, was sent to the printer near the close of the year, and most
of the illustrations have been engraved.

The Institution aided in the preparation of an exhaustive bibliog-
raphy on the fossil vertebrates of North America by Mr. O. P. Hay,
but the manner of its publication has not been determined.

LIBRARY.

The number of volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts
added to the library has aggregated 36,663. A considerable number
of these were retained in the working libraries of the Institution and
the Museum, but the great majority were transferred to the Smith-
sonian deposit in the Library of Congress. The improved facilities for
reference and care of books in the new building make it possible to
send to the Library of Congress a much greater proportion of books
received than heretofore, and it is gratifying to report that most of
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the vast mass of Smithsonian material that had accumulated in the old
Library has now been arranged in a systematic manner, and is available
for study.

The east stack, in which the transactions of learned societies and
periodicals belonging to the Smithsonian deposit were placed, lacked
the necessary conveniences to enable scholars to consult these series
direct.

The Librarian of Congress has recognized the disadvantages of the
present situation, and proposes asking Congress to provide furniture
for several of the large halls, in order that these series may be made
available to the numerous scientific students desiring to consult them.
In this connection he also intends to ask provision for the proper cus-
tody of the collection. I sincerely trust that Congress may see its

ray clear to supporting these various measures of the Librarian for
making the library worthy of its new home and of the nation. ;

A special room is being fitted up in the Institution for the care of
engravings and works relating to the fine arts.

As in nearly every other line of Smithsonian activities, so in the
library, lack of sufficient room prevents the introduction of desired
improvements. The cataloguing and reading rooms, that seemed
ample for the growth of many years, have in a brief time become
greatly crowded, and additional quarters will soon be absolutely
necessary.

CORRESPONDENCE.

In accordance with the general plan which has been in vogue in the
Institution ever since its foundation, careful attention has been given
to all communications received, and it has been endeavored so far as
possible to furnish information called for. A considerable number of
letters contained inquiries haying no bearing on the activities of the
Institution, or on science in general, but even in such cases, where
data could be conveniently had, replies have been made. A large
number of communications have also been referred to other bureaus
or establishments of the Government having immediate supervision of
the matters to which they related.

Letters pertaining to matters of a special nature, or which on
account of their importance deserve special care in handling, with a
view to insuring attention are entered in a register kept especially
for the purpose, and 3,381 of these special entries have been made
during the year covered by this report. In accordance with the rule
observed with this correspondence, a record is made of each individual
step in the treatment of the letter untii it can be reported that it has
been completely attended to and placed on file.

It is gratifying to note that, owing to the careful manner in which
the routine has been established and systematized, there has been
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. a lif

little or no occasion during the year to add to or alter the rules goy-
erning the conduct of correspondence, and the wisdom of the plan of
filing has been demonstrated by the ability to find almost invariably
at a moment’s notice any papers relating to a subject called up for
attention. The card index, devised by my regretted friend William
C. Winlock and begun on January 1, 1893, of all letters received and
letters written within the parent Institution, as well as those pertaining
to the several bureaus which require under the rules to pass through
the Secretary’s office, has been kept current and has fully demon-
strated its eficiency. This index has, since it was first instituted, been
extended back to cover letters as early as January 1, 1892.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES.

International Congress of Zoology.—Prof. O. C. Marsh was, on July
14, 1898, nominated by the Institution and later was appointed by the
Secretary of State as United States delegate to an International Con-
gress of Zoology, held at Cambridge, England, August 23, 1898.

International Congress of Orientalists.—On December 9, 1898, the
Secretary designated Dr. Paul Haupt and Prof. Charles R. Lanman as
delegates of the Institution, and the Department of State accredited
them as delegates of the United States, to attend the Twelfth Inter-
national Congress of Orientalists at Rome, on October 2, 1899, and on
February 3, 1899, Professor Jastrow was recognized as Government
delegate to the same congress.

International Catalogue of Scientific Literature.—The Secretary and
the Librarian were appointed delegates to a Conference on an Inter-
national Catalogue of Scientific Literature to be held in London on
July 12, 1898, and postponed to October 11. By reason of this post-
ponement the Secretary was unable to attend the meeting, the United
States Government being represented by Dr. Adler, who presented
the following report to the Secretary of State:

WasuHineton, Vovember 15, 1898.

Sir: Having been appointed, together with Mr. 8. P. Langley, Sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution, a delegate on the part of the
United States to the Conference on an International Catalogue of Scei-
entific Literature, to be held at London on July 12, 1898, we proceeded
abroad on July 2.

The British Government found it expedient to postpone the confer-
ence until October 11. At the request of the Department, and with the
consent of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, I continued
abroad and attended the conference. Mr. Langley’s official duties
necessitated his return to the United States in September.

The deliberations were in continuation of those had at a previous
conference in 1896, at which this Government was also represented.
Satisfactory conclusions were reached, leaving only such questions as
can be definitely determined by an international committee, on which
the United States is represented by Mr. Langley.

sm 99——2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

I have the honor to transmit herewith the acta of the conference.
The procés verbal will be issued later, and a copy forwarded to the
Department.

I beg most respectfully to bring to your notice the report of the
delegates of the United States to the first conference (Prof. Simon
Newcomb and Dr. J. 8. Billings), to repeat the recommendations made
by them, and to further draw your attention to the recommendation of
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, all of which is contained
in Senate Document No. 43, Fifty-fourth Congress, second session, a
copy of which is herewith appended.

I have much pleasure in informing you that both in public and pri-
vately the delegates of the United Kingdom and of other powers
expressed a very generous appreciation of the scientific activity of the
United States, and I beg to be allowed to commend to the favorable
consideration of the Department the recommendation of such legisla-
tion as will enable the United States to worthily take its share in this
highly important international project.

I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,
Cyrus ADLER.
The SECRETARY OF STATE.

His reply is given herewith:

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
Washington, November 25, 1898.

Str: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th
instant in regard to the work of the Conference on an International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature which met at London on the 11th
ultimo and to which you were a delegate on the part of the United
States.

With reference to your suggestion-that such legislation be recom-
mended to Congress as will enable the United States to worthily take
its share in this highly useful and important international project, I
have to state that I had already, in the estimates for this Department
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, submitted an item of $10,000,
or so much thereof as may be necessary, for the purpose of carrying
out on the part’of the United States the recommendation of the Inter-
national Conference on a Catalogue of Scientific Literature, and for
the expense of clerk hire and for the other expenses of the work of
cataloguing the scientific publications of the United States, the same
to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, and pointed out that as the preparation of the catalogue is
to begin on January 1, 1900, it would be necessary for appropiate
action to be taken by Congress at its forthcoming session, if this Goy-
ernment is to participate therein.

In support of this recommendation, I inclosed as appendices a copy
of the Congressional document to which you refer and a copy of your
report on the conference of 1896. The estimates are now in print and
it is too late to have your present letter included therein; but I shall,
upon the assembling of Congress, communicate it to that body in
further support of the item.

Iam, sir, your obedient servant,
[L. s. | Joun Hay.
Prof. Cyrus ADLER,
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. £9

Since that date many difficulties have arisen over questions of classi-
fication and management of the catalogue, but I still hope that some
way may be found of bringing to a successful issue this worthy project.

EXPOSITIONS.

The several bureaus of the Institution participated in the Trans-
Mississippi Exposition at Omaha, which opened June 1, 1898, and
continued for five months. An account of the exhibits will be printed
elsewhere.

In an act of Congress approved March 3, 1899, the sum of $300,000
was appropriated for a Government exhibit in connection with the
Pan-American Exposition to be held at Buffalo in 1901, with $200,000
additional for the erection of a building. Dr. F. W. True has been
designated to represent the Smithsonian Institution and the National
Museum on the Government Board of Management, and Mr. W. V.
Cox as chief special agent.

On the date above mentioned an act was also approved allowing
similar amounts for a Government exhibit and building at the Ohio
Centennial Exposition to be held at Toledo in 1902 or 1903, as may
be determined upon hereafter. This appropriation is, however, con-
ditional upon a grant of $500,000 to the exposition by the legisla-
ture of the State of Ohio and the raising of an equal amount by
subscription.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Documentary history of the Institution.—The legislative history of
the Institution from 1877 to date, mentioned in the Secretary’s last
Report, has been extended and revised, but not yet published.

Gifts and bequests.—Among the important collections received by
the Institution during the year may be mentioned a large series of
medals gathered by Hon. Charles Francis Adams, United States min-
ister to England, and deposited with the Smithsonian Institution by
his son, Henry Adams; some Japanese masks received through Dr.
Alexander Graham Bell; a valuable early book on whales presented
by the British Museum; and a large number of very interesting his
torical objects pertaining to the war with Spain, transmitted by the
Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of War.

Foreign institutions.—TVhe relations of the Smithsonian Institution
with other institutions of learning throughout the world continue to
be most cordial. During the past year communications were received
inviting participation in the Centennial of the Russian Imperial Mili-
tary Academy of Medicine, the Gauss-Weber Memorial at Gottingen,
the Stokes Celebration at Cambridge, and the Centenary of the Royal
Institution of Great Britain.

Dr. W. L. Wilson, Regent, and the Secretary were appointed Smith-
sonian representatives at the Royal Society celebration and were made
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

honorary members of that important scientific body. Dr. Wilson was
unavoidably prevented from attendance; the Institution, however, par-
ticipated vicariously in the imposing ceremonies of the Centenary, and
at a banquet presided over by the Duke of Northumberland, and at
which the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Connaught were present,
its representative responded to the toast on behalf of the foreign
guests proposed by the Lord Chancellor.

The Secretary also attended the semicentennial celebration in honor
of Prof. William Stokes, held at Cambridge, and paid a visit to Pem-
broke College, at Oxford, at which James Smithson was graduated.
In a conspicuous place in the library of the college is the Smithson
memorial tablet, presented by the Institution a few years ago, and in
a special bookease suitably marked is a full set of the publications of
the Institution. The Secretary also visited Genoa and found the tab-
lets sent by the Regents had been properly placed on the tomb of
Smithson on the heights of San Benigno and in the English church in
the city.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Smithsonian Museum, or, as it is commonly called, the National
Museum, has grown to be the largest interest of the Institution, and
the future growth of this most important work is limited only by the
willingness of Congress to provide means for its extension and main-
tenance. Each year seems to be a phenomenal one in the increase of
the collections, and more and more imperative does it become that
greater space be provided for the display of the valuable contributions
constantly being received. The collections now comprise nearly four
and a half million specimens, illustrating practically every branch of
anthropology, biology, and geology. During the past year the acces-
sions numbered more than 200,000 specimens.

The new galleries have been of great benefit in relieving some of the
crowded halls, and additional storage quarters enable a better handling
of objects than heretofore, but a proper display of all the collections
will not be possible until a new building is erected, as the present one,
even with the aid just referred to, is in parts in a state of continued
congestion.

Among new accessions of special interest may be mentioned about
1,000 ethnological objects of exceptional value pertaining to the Indians
of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, archeological collections
made by Mr. Holmes in Mexico, collections by Mr. Beckwith in Puerto
Rico, and some electrical apparatus from the Boston fire department,
and from other sources, and also a large number of most valuable his-
torical objects relating to the war with Spain, secured through the
courtesy of the Navy Department, several of the bureau chiefs taking
a lively interest in collecting articles of special importance. There
were also received from the Society of Colonial Dames and the Society
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oi |

of Daughters of the American Revolution some very interesting his-
torical objects pertaining to colonial and Revolutionary war periods.
The most extensive additions to the biological collections were from
Puerto Rico. In the department of geology the Museum is enriched
by the addition of several large accessions transferred by the U. 8.
Geological Survey. These objects and others of importance are men-
tioned more in detail in the appendix to this Report.

The Museum continues to benefit greatly by the exchange of dupli-
cate specimens with foreign museums. some very valuable accessions
having recently been made in this way.

It became possible several years ago to arrange for the distribution
of duplicates of certain classes of objects to educational establishments,
and the extent to which this very valuable work can be carried on is
limited only by lack of adequate appropriations for assistance in the
preparation of the specimens. The total distribution during the year
included 25,000 specimens, consisting mainly of marine invertebrates,
rocks and ores, and casts of prehistoric stone implements.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Field operations and office studies have been continued by the Bureau
of American Ethnology under the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell. In
Maine, Florida, Arizona, California, Alaska, Patagonia, and other
regions explorations and researches were carried on which resulted in
the addition of much valuable material to the National Museum collec-
tions, and in the partial solution of important problems concerning the
aborigines of America. The details of the work of the bureau are
fully set forth by Major Powell in the appendix to this Report.

Under special authorization of the Secretary, Mr. Holmes and Mr.
McGee made somewhat exhaustive researches in California, gaining
considerable new knowledge of the archeology of the regions visited
and gathering a large number of very interesting prehistoric relics.

At the Omaha Exposition the Bureau of Ethnology cooperated in
an Indian Congress that created considerable popular interest. The
Indians lived in houses and lodges of their own construction. A spe-
cial object of interest was a Wichita grass house brought from Indian
Territory, and afterwards transferred to Washington City.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The Smithsonian Exchange Service was established to facilitate the
interchange of scientific publications between domestic and foreign
institutions and societies, and of public documents between the United
States and foreign countries, resulting in most valuable additions to
the Library of Congress either directly or by the deposit of exchanges
received by the Smithsonian Institution.
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It has constantly grown until it has carried the work of the Institu-
tion, and incidentally its own name, through every part of the world,
and it would be well to recall. the constantly growing number of its
correspondents, which at the close of the year had reached 31,000, of
whom 23,000 are outside the United States.

No portion of the work done by the Institution more justifies the
motto of its seal, ‘‘ PER ORBEM,” and possibly even the general reader
may care to look at the indications of the vast amount of correspond-
ence that 1s carried on as given in the report of the assistant in charge.

The weight of packages handled by the service during the past year
was 317,883 pounds and their total number was 97,835, representing
10,322 foreign societies, 13,378 foreign individuals, and 7,269 domestic
societies and individuals.

There were received from abroad and distributed to domestic
addresses 30,645 packages. The total number of correspondents at
the close of the year was 30,969, an increase of 1,511 over the previous
year. These are scattered over nearly every portion of the globe.

The new distributing agencies established in Vienna sb Budapest
have proved very beneficial and relieved the former severe pressure at
the Leipzig agency.

The small increase in the appropriation granted by Congress has
enabled the service to dispatch packages by more expeditious routes
than heretofore, and greater improvement still is expected during the
coming year

The thanks of the Institution are again due to those forwarding
agencies who for many years have granted special courtesies in facili-
tating the dispatch of exchanges.

The very complete record system practiced in the Service made it
possible to determine the contents, source, and destination of several
boxes lost by the foundering of two ocean steamers, and to arrange
for their duplication in nearly every instance.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

As the result of special effort a considerable number of valuable
animals have been added to the zoological park.

Through the courtesy of the Secretaries of State, War, and ee
an ilinstrated circular prepared by the Secretary and describing the
zoological park has been distributed to officers of the United States
throughout the world, and in this way the special wants of the park
have been made known and methods of caring for animals to be trans-
mitted have been explained. As one of the results of this effort, a
very interesting group of animals was forwarded by Commander Todd
of the U.S. 8. Wilmington, having been obtained while on a cruise up
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. De

the Amazon River, and other naval and army officers have called
attention to the probability of securing further important accessions.

Among other additions have been several secured in Japan by Dr.
Alexander Graham Bell. Though all of those who have thus aided in
developing the national collections have their contributions acknowl-
edged, the Secretary desires to take this opportunity of again express-
ing to them his thanks.

Improvements in the park buildings and roads have been made as
far as available appropriations permitted.

The most important work in road construction has been grading and
macadamizing the road to Klingle Ford entrance, at an annual expense
of $5,000, in compliance with the terms of the appropriation act.

An expensive yet necessary improvement, now that roadways lead-
ing to the park have been completed at established grades, is the con-
struction of a tight fence around the entire park, in order to prevent
the entrance of dogs and other predatory animals, and thus to allow
small game to runat large. There appears to be great need of grading
the precipitous banks on the eastern boundary of the park, a work,
however, which would require the expenditure of about $10,000.

The aquarium, of which I have already spoken to Congress, and
which is a feature of the highest popular interest, deserves a building,
and an estimate to cover the cost of commencement of one ample to
accommodate the immediate needs of the park has been included in the
general estimate for appropriations, though the item is not specifically
given.

A primary object for which Congress established the zoological
park was the preservation of fast vanishing species of American ani-
mals.

The same phenomenon which was noticeable in the western part of
of the country some years ago is now occurring in Alaska. With the
advent of the settler and the railroad in the West, the great herds of
animals which ranged over our western territory were practically
exterminated, though by strenuous efforts here and there small collec-
tions of the buffalo and other large interesting mammals, like those in
the National Zoological Park, have been kept alive. Whether a race
‘an be made to survive in this way is open to question, but the effort
at least should be made, and the Institution is trying to promote this
survival.

The United States still possesses at Kadiak Island, on the southeast
coast of Alaska, a few living specimens of the largest carniverous ani-
mal now in the wor/d—a monster bear—which has not, to my knowledge,
at any time been brought into captivity. I have been trying for two
years, through American companies on the island, to obtain live speci-
mens of this and other great mammals of Alaska with the hope of
preserving the species before the inevitable opening of all that distant

24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

territory of the United States to civilization and settlement will have
resulted in the extermination of its large fauna, but these efforts have
hitherto been wholly unsuccessful.

A secondary purpose of Congress in establishing the park was the
recreation of the people, and this purpose has certainly proved of great
public benefit, while the advantage of the zoological park as a means of
education has become interestingly manifest by the constantly increas-
ing number of school children who, with their teachers, visit the park
and there make a life study of the animals. Interesting illustrations
of this are given in the superintendent’s report.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The operations of the Astrophysical Observatory during the last
year have been of continued interest, although the work is done under
difficulties, owing to the excessively confined quarters, which were
originally intended only as temporary sheds for the instruments, and
which are shown in the accompanying illustration.

In my last Report attention was called to the remarkable periodic
changes in the absorption of water vapor in the air, as recently dis-
covered by inspection of the records of the Astrophysical Observatory.
This matter has been more carefully investigated this year, and it has
been found that these changes occur to a marked degree in the spring
and fall months each year, and occasionally at other times as well. It
would be a matter of great interest if these remarkable variations in
the atmospheric absorption could be traced simultaneously at different
latitudes and longitudes, and such a research might lead to results of
far-reaching importance.

Attention is again called to the announcement in the report of the
Aid Acting in Charge of a technical result of interest to the effect that
prisms can now be easily constructed in which indices of refraction
and wave lengths are, so far as can be seen, in as ‘*‘ constant” a relation
as exists between deviation and wave lengths in the grating.

The accuracy of the Observatory work, it will be remembered,
depends, strange as it may appear, on our increased knowledge of the
optical properties of rock salt. This year it has been shown that, so
far as the accuracy of the most painstaking measurements can go, these
indicate that rock-salt prisms, whether mined at one part or another of
the earth’s surface, have identical refractive indices, and thus the meas-
ures of 1897-98, which determined the exact positions of 700 Fraun-
hofer lines in the infra red spectrum of rock salt, may be regarded as
fixing ‘‘constants of nature.”

One of the pieces of work accomplished in this last year, however,
has been to-go further and redetermine the dispersion of rock salt in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

terms of wave lengths. The excellent facilities of the Observatory
have enabled this to be done with such great accuracy as to give the
wave lengths of the lines discovered to an average accuracy of 3 parts
in 10,000.

This brings up the analysis of the infra red solar spectrum to a point
closely corresponding with that reached by eye observations in the
visible spectrum prior to the use of photography and the concave
grating, and it is certainly calculated to excite a feeling of wonder to
know that it is possible to thus automatically obtain in the dark, by
means of the bolometer, results comparable in accuracy with those
reached by incomparably more pains through the eye itself.

Personal investigation into the phenomena of the Welsbach mantle
had interested me in their purely scientific aspect, but the records of my
early prolonged investigation being unfortunately inaccessible, I have
asked Mr. Abbot, Aid Acting in Charge, to repeat these experiments
with the aid of the completer bolometric apparatus, more recently
acquired by the Observatory. He has done so with marked success,
and pending still further investigation attention is called to the inter-
esting curves reproduced in his detailed report. An interesting thing
in connection with these curves is that they show, as I have elsewhere
remarked, that all artificial lights, even the best, are extravagantly
wasteful of energy, in that they lavish it in the infra-red and not in
the visible spectrum. Nature here as elsewhere does what we can not,
for the glowworm and the firefly are still able to confine their exertions
to the production of light with comparatively little heat, and to set us
an example which would add millions to the nation’s wealth if we could
imitate it successfully on a commercial scale.

I am gratified to say that the first extensive publication of the
Astrophysical Observatory is now in the hands of the Public Printer.

NECROLOGY.
JUSTIN SMITH MORRILL.

Senator Justin Smith Morrill was born in Strafford, Vermont, April
14, 1810, and died in Washington City December 28, 1898. He was
appointed regent February 21, 1883, and reappointed March 23, 1885,
December 15, 1891, and March 15, 1897.

The following most true as well as deeply felt tribute to the memory
of Senator Morrill was given by Mr. Henderson at the last meeting
of the Regents of the Institution :

I feel a personal loss in the death of Senator Morrill, whom I had
known somewhat intimately from 1862, and with whom I had been
associated, more or less, in public life when I was a young man.

Mr. Chancellor, the deceased statesman, Mr. Morrill, is now per-
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

fectly secure in his well-earned fame. It was said by one of the Latin
poets that no man should be esteemed happy before his funeral. In
this case the sad rites have been performed, and to the end of a most
useful life he kept the faith.

In his career we have an illustration of the beauty and excellency of
our republican institutions. His education was limited, but his honesty
and patriotism had no bounds. He did what conscience dictated to be
done and put his trust in those he served. He loved not license, but
liberty as defined by Cicero—**the power to do what the law permits.”
He was true to his constituents, and in return they gave him those
priceless gifts of freemen, their gratitude and fidelity.

He represented a State small in population and wealth, but rich in
the character of its people and rich in the long line of able, pure, and
distinguished statesmen she has given to the National Councils. The
horizon of his usefulness, like that of Collamer, Foote, and Edmunds,
extended beyond the State of Vermont. He was broad as the Union
itself.

From 1855 to 1867 he was a member of the House of Representa-
tives. In 1861 private industries had become prostrated and bank- ~
ruptey threatened the National Treasury. Secession had already
commenced the work of dissolution, when he prepared and pressed to
enactment the tariff laws of that year. Waiving the question of pro-
tection, the necessity for revenue alone demanded its passage, and the
. beneficent results gave national reputation to its author. He came to
the Senate in 1867, and continued a member of that body until the
date of his death, having received six successive elections by the legis-
lature of his State. In the Senate he stood at all times for a sound
currency. He had deplored the original issue of United States notes
in 1862, and, true to his convicticns of right, in after years he consist-
ently demanded the performance of the nation’s pledge that they be
redeemed and canceled. He believed with all his heart that the gold
dollar should measure values throughout the commercial world, and,
unmoved by the clamors of hard times, he persevered in his faith until
the fulfillment of his prophecies has broken the stubborn unbelief of
millions.

Through his efforts the statues of distinguished Americans now
adorn the old Representative hall of the Capitol, where his own so
well deserves to be placed.

Largely through his exertions came the building constructed for
the State, War, and Navy Departments; and the last legislative act of
his lite was to provide a building for the use of the Supreme Court
of the United States. To us who knew him so well it brings pro-
found pleasure that he lived to see the Library building completed,
which not only in its purposes but in the splendor of its architecture
does honor to the nation. somewhere within its walls a modest tablet
should at least connect his name with this magnificent structure. It
is no less a monument to his memory than is St. Paul’s Cathedral to
the memory of Sir Christopher Wren. ;

For the last eighteen years he was a regent of this Institution, ever
watchful of its interests and prompt to increase its usefulness. In
the grandeur of his country he felt the patriot’s pride. He sought to
make its capital city worthy of the people to whom it belonged; and
the Smithsonian Institution was regarded by him as a chief factor in
its future greatness and renown. :
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ye

My acquaintance with Mr. Morrill began in 1862. In my earlier
days I enjoyed his counsel and instruction in public affairs. He was,
in my judgment, the true American nobleman. Here, as elsewhere,
distinction imposes increased obligations—noblesse oblige. No books
of heraldry and no blazoned emblems are necessary to evidence the
rank of Senator Morrill. His patent of nobility is recorded in the
hearts of a grateful people.

Little can be added to Senator Henderson’s words, but the Secretary
asks to be permitted to record here his own sense of the loss of a
dear and honored friend.

Respectfully submitted.

S. P. Lane ey,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S -REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Sr: I have the honor to submit the following condensed report upon the present
condition of the National Museum and the progress made during the year ending
June 30, 1899:

In addition to the building, heating plant, and other equipment, the fixed prop-
erty of the Museum consists of collections, books, office furniture, and cases and other
receptacles for exhibiting and storing specimens.

The collections comprise nearly 4,400,000 specimens, including objects in all
branches of anthropology, biology, and geology.

Since July 1, 1898, the collections have been increased by the acquisition of about
211,000 specimens.

The cases used for exhibiting specimens number about 2,250, and those used for
storage purposes about 1,500.

The office furniture, including tables, desks, chairs, file cases, typewriters, book-
cases, and minor articles, comprises about 900 pieces. There are also some 500 chairs,
formerly used in the lecture room.

New furniture and fixtures have been acquired to the value of nearly $35,000,
more than half of this amount having been expended for cases for the new galleries.

The library contains about 12,000 volumes and 8,500 pamphlets, not including the
library of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode, which comprises about 2,900 volumes,
18,000 pamphlets, and 1,800 portraits, engravings, etc., and which was purchased
during the past year by special authorization of Congress. During the year covered
by this report 640 books, 965 pamphlets, and 5,196 parts of periodicals were catalogued.

Additional galleries have been erected, and steps have been taken toward the
construction of skylights, for which special provision was made by Congress. The
appropriation for these purposes was $10,000. Two of the old wooden floors in the
Museum building have been replaced by terrazzo pavements.

There have been no losses of property during the year.

The boilers connected with the heating plant in the Museum building have been
in use for nearly twenty years and are now practically worn out. They should be
replaced.

The Museum staff.—Dr. O. C. Marsh, professor of paleontology at Yale University,
and for many years connected with the staff of the National Museum in the capacity
of Honorary Curator of vertebrate fossils, died March 18, 1899.

Mr. E. A. Schwarz, who formerly had charge of the coleopterous larvee, has now
been placed in charge of the entire collection of coleoptera, and Mr. Nathan Banks
has been made Custodian of the collection of arachnida.

Mr. O. F. Cook, who has been connected with the Museum in the capacity of
Assistant Curator in the Division of Plants, has been on leave of absence for several
months. Having recently accepted a position in the Department of Agriculture, he
has now been made Honorary Assistant Curator in charge of the cryptogamic
collections.

Dr. George H. Girty has been appointed as Custodian of the carboniferous collec-
tions in the Section of Invertebrate Fossils. .

28
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

Mr. George C. Maynard, Custodian of the Electrical Collections, has also been
designated Aid in the Division of Technology.

Dr, A. C. Peale was appointed Aid in the Section of Paleobotany on July 25, 1898.

Explorations.—The explorations which have been carried on during the year have
been conducted for the most part by curators of the Museum and other members of
itsstaff. So far very little has been done toward making systematic collections in
the territory recently brought under the control of the United States. (Congress
was asked for a specific appropriation which would enable the Institution to carry
on work in this direction, but no funds were provided. )

The anthropological, explorations for the year have been fruitful of results. In
September, 1898, Mr. W. H. Holmes visited California in the interest of the Museum
and secured valuable collections illustrating both the ethnology and archeology of
that State. From the auriferous gravel region of Nevada, and from Calaveras and
Tuolumne counties, California, many stone implements, supposed to have a bearing
upon the occupation of those areas by Tertiary man, weresecured. The ancient soap-
stone quarries on Santa Catalina Island were visited, and explorations were made in
two prehistoric burial places._ From the latter a number of relics were obtained.
The most extensive collections made by Mr. Holmes represent the basketry, imple-
ments, etc., of the Pomo, Digger, and Tulare Indians.

In April, 1899, Mr. Holmes spent a month in Mexico, securing important collec-
tions from the ancient Aztec obsidian mines of the State of Hidalgo, besides various
relics from the ancient cities of San Juan, Teotihuacan, and Xochicalco.

In September, 1898, Mr. Paul Beckwith, representing the Division of History, was
sent to Cuba and Puerto Rico for the purpose of collecting for the Museum, especial
attention being given to gathering relics illustrating the war with Spain. Many
valuable objects were secured, and agencies were set at work, calculated to add
greatly to this interesting series of exhibits.

Mr. J. B. Hatcher, who has been carrying on extensive explorations in Patagonia
for Princeton University, has forwarded to the National Museum one valuable lot of
ethnological specimens, and important additions are expected at an early date.

Early in May, 1899, Dr. Walter Hough was detailed to carry on ethno-botanical
researches in Mexico, in connection with the explorations of the Division of Botany,
in charge of Dr. J. N. Rose.

Among the explorations yielding important results to the Department of Biology,
those conducted by the naturalists of the U. 8. Fish Commission and by Mr. A. B.
Baker, in Puerto Rico and yicinity, are worthy of particular mention. Of mollusks
the Museum received some 5,000 specimens, representing about 400 species, many of
them rare or undescribed. Large series of other marine and fresh-water inverte-
brates, about 180 birds, 200 specimens of reptiles and batrachians, and 200 bats were
collected. A large and important series of mammals from Sweden, Germany,
Switzerland, and Belgium was obtained for, and under the direction of, the Museum
by Mr. J. A. Loring, of Owego, New York. Mr. Dall de Weese visited Alaska during
the summer of 1898 and special arrangements were made with him for procuring
large mammals for the Museum. Hesecured seyeral specimens of the Alaskan moose,
and a large number of the wild white sheep of that Territory. Dr. E. A. Mearns,
U. 8. A., made collections of birds’ skins in Texas.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates has been enriched by material collected by
- Dr. T. H. Bean and Mr. B. A. Bean on Long Island; by Miss Mary J. Rathbun, at
Grand Manan, New Brunswick; by Messrs. William Palmer and Paul Bartsch, in the
Dismal Swamp, Virginia; by Mr. Harold Heath in Monterey Bay, California, and by
the Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York. As the result of explora-
tionsin the North Pacific, Alaska, Kamchatka, Lake Superior, and Florida, collections
of fishes were transferred to the Museum by the Fish Commission.
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Dr. J. N. Rose was engaged at the close of the fiscal year in explorations in Mexico,
where, it is believed, he will secure much valuable botanical material. He is
accompanied, as already stated, by Dr. Walter Hough, who is charged with the
collection of ethno-botanical specimens. Important botanical collections have been
made by Messrs. W. T. Swingle and D. G. Fairchild in Europe. Explorations con-
ducted by members of the Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture, have resulted
in the substantial enrichment of the herbarium. A series of Mexican plants, collected
by Mr. E. W. Nelson, was purchased by the Museum.

The fossil plants from the lower coal measures of Henry County, Missouri, and the
carboniferous fossils from Indian Territory, referred to elsewhere, were collected by
Messrs. W. P. Jenney, Gilbert Van Ingen, 8. A. Miller,and Dr. J. H. Britts, under
the auspices of the U. 8. Geological Survey. The explorations of Mr. H. E. Dickhaut,
of the Survey, in the vicinity of Lockport, New York, and of Mr. Paul Bartsch, of
the Museum staff, in Iowa, yielded important results. The former collected a valu-
able series of Medina and Niagara fossils, and the latter, Hamilton corals and Kinder-
hook fossils. Geological material obtained by Mr. F. W. Crosby in Europe, and by
Mr. Edward Palmer, in Mexico, has been added to the collections.

Accessions.—There was an increase of 55 in the number of accessions for the year,
the total being 1,497. Owing to the limitations of space, it is impossible to do more
than refer briefly in this place to some of the most important of them, under the
heads of anthropology, biology, and geology. The material obtained by special expe-
ditions has already been referred to.

Anthropology.—The collection of ethnological specimens from the Indian tribes of
the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, purchased from Mr. E. Granier, of Paris,
France, contains about 1,000 specimens, many of which are of exceptional value,
having been collected a number of years ago. They comprise articles of costume,
implements of many kinds, ceremonial objects, ete. The specimens of beadwork
and quill embroidery are especially notable.

A collection of great value illustrating Mexican ethnology and archeology was
obtained from Mr. E. W. Nelson. The number of specimens is not large, but they
have especial value to the Museum as coming from districts rarely visited by its
representatives.

From Dr. E. Palmer some additional Mexican material has been received, a feature
of especial interest being a native still of most primitive construction.

A second collection of stone implements and miscellaneous relics was purchased
from Dr. Roland Steiner during the month of June, but the specimens have not yet
been catalogued. The same may be said of a very important collection of Indian
basketry obtained from Dr. W. J. Hudson, of Ukiah, California.

Among the more important collections of electrical objects received during the
year is one deposited by Miss Sarah J. Farmer, of Eliot, Maine. It consists of
various pieces of apparatus devised and used by the late Moses G. Farmer in his
experimental work in the various branches of electrical science.

Other collections of interest, illustrating this branch, may be briefly mentioned:
Original fire alarm telegraph apparatus, deposited by the fire department of Bos-
ton, Massachusetts, through correspondence with Col. H. 8. Russell, fire commissioner;
a collection of insulated and uninsulated conductors used for the transmission of cur-
rents of electricity for lighting and power purposes, besides some telegraph and tele-
phone eables and trolley wires, lent by John A. Roebling’s Sons Company, of Trenton,
New Jersey; a pocket telegraph instrument made by J. D. Caton, Ottawa, Illinois,
and a Morse telegraph relay and sounder made of silver by 8. W. Chubbuck, Utica,
New York, and. deposited in the Museum by D. Wilmot Smith, of Breckinridge,
Minnesota.

Biology.—Mr. W. B. Moss, of Ashton-under-Lyne, England, presented a collection
of about 3,000 specimens of small shells, mostly marine gastropods, collected by the.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. bl

Rey. James Hadfield and Mrs. Hadfield at Lifou Island, Loyalty Group, central
Pacific Ocean. Most of these have but recently been described, and nearly all are
new to the collection. A number of valuable river mussels from the Southern States,
including a number of types of species described by Mr. B. H. Wright, of Penn Yan,
New York, have been received from the latter.

Large and valuable collections of hemiptera, hymenoptera, siphonaptera, and
mallophaga were presented by Prof. Carl F. Baker, of Auburn, Alabama. Mr. W. H.
Ashmead has presented his private collection of insects, which is especially rich in
type material and includes not less than 60,000 specimens. Prof. V. L. Kellogg, of
the Leland Stanford Junior University, gave 60 microscopical preparations of
mallophaga, mounted on glass slides.

Eighty species of brachyuran and anomuran crustaceans were received in exchange
from the Museum of Natural History, Paris; and 47 species of decapod crustaceans
were acquired from the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
in exchange.

Five skins of the California condor were obtained by purchase. Mr. Paul D.
Bergen, of Chefoo, China, sent 48 skins of Chinese birds in exchange. From the
Albany Museum, Grahamstown, South Africa, 29 bird skins were received, and
Prof. M. F. Colunga, Lima, Peru, transmitted 24 Peruvian skins in exchange for
other material. Skins from New Zealand, Colombia, and China were received,
respectively, from Messrs. L. T. Ayson, Masterton, New Zealand; Mr. Outram
Bangs, Boston, Massachusetts, and Mr. George D. Wilder, Pekin, China. One
hundred and eighty-four bird skins from various localities in the United States were
presented by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. A. Dr. W. L. Ralph contributed 207 birds’
eggs, and 127 eggs were received from Prof. C. F. Baker.

In the Division of Comparative Anatomy the most important accession was a small
collection of mounted skeletons of cartilaginous fishes purchased for use in connec-
tion with the exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, held in Omaha.

A series of fishes from northern and central Asia was received in exchange from
the Museum of Natural History, Paris; a specimen of Icosteus xnigmaticus was pre-
sented by Mr. John Chapman, San Diego, California, and a specimen of Rhamphocot-
tus, from the coast of Washington, by Mr. O. E. Shaffer, Port Townsend, Washing-
ton. Type specimens of several species of fishes were transmitted by the U.S. Fish
Commission.

A series of 1,049 specimens of plants, collected in Florida in 1843-1849, was received
from the British Museum (Natural History). Five hundred specimens of Samoan
plants, 674 Colorado plants, and about 2,500 Mexican plants were obtained by pur-
chase. Mr. J. G. Baker, London, England, presented a portion of his private her-
barium. Seven hundred plants from the Gulf coast were purchased and 300 specimens
from southern Florida were collected by Mr. C. L. Pollard.

A large number of reptiles and batrachians, collected in various parts of the world
by field parties of the Fish Commission, were transferred to the Museum. This col-
lection embraces much material valuable in connection with the study of geographical
distribution and individual variation. One’of the most interesting specimens was a
discoglossoid toad, described by Dr. Stejneger under the name Ascaphus truei. An
interesting collection of reptiles from Java, collected by Mr. D. G. Fairchild, was
received from the Department of Agriculture.

A collection consisting of 80 specimens of European bats, and another consisting
of 52 specimens of Norwegian mammals, were purchased. Baron E. de Selys-Long-
champs, of Liege, Belgium, presented 24 European mammals. An Asiatic elephant,
a lion, and numerous other mammals were received from the National Zoological
Park. :

Geology.—The largest accessions in the Division of Invertebrate Paleontology were
those from the U. 8. Geological Survey, comprising between six and seven thou-

sand specimens. Among the more valuable collections from this source is an exten-
sive series of Cambrian brachiopods, determined by Mr. C. D. Walcott, and certain
specimens of Lower Cretaceous fossils, figured in Bulletin No. 151 of the Survey.
An important collection of fossils from the Cincinnati group, consisting of about
4,000 specimens and including many pelecypods, was obtained by purchase. Three
valuable series of Post-Pliocene corals were received in exchange from the Geologi-
cal Museum, Leyden; the University Museum of Natural History, Turin, and the
British Museum of Natural History, respectively. Valuable specimens of Upper
Carboniferous fossils from Texas were acquired by purchase. About 900 Carbonif-
erous fossils, collected by Messrs. Taff and Richardson in Indian Territory, were
acquired from the Geological Survey. These have been described by Mr. David
White in the Nineteenth Annual Report of the Survey, which was in press at the
close of the year. Mr. R. D. Lacoe has made substantial additions to the collections
which bear his name, 30 boxes of Carboniferous plants having recently been
received from him.

The Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, transmitted a small series of
teeth of Paleozoic sharks. Mr. A. B. Baker collected some fossil fishes in Kansas.
A collection of skulls of mammals of the White River Miocene formation, obtained by
Mr. N. H. Darton, was received from the Geological Survey. Fossils of this formation
had not previously been discovered in the locality from which these were obtained.
A skull of a new species of bear (Ursus procerus) was purchased, and a fine skull of a
species of Hydracodon was presented by Mr. A. W. Barber, Washington, District of
Columbia.

Eighty-eight specimens from different localities were received from the Geological
Survey by the Division of Minerals. This collection includes specimens of cesium,
beryl, bixbyite (a new mineral), tysonite, a fine series of endlichite, specimens of
minium, tourmaline, chrysoberyl, martite, and wolframite. A specimen of parisite
from Missoula County, Montana, was presented by Mr. F. D. Smith, through the
U. 8S. Geological Survey. Mr. George F. Kunz, of Tiffany & Co., New York City,
presented a specimen of prosopite, a rare mineral. Six specimens of roscoelite on
auriferous quartz from Eldorado, California, were presented by Mr. G. W. Kimble,
through the U. 8. Geological Survey. Five specimens of native arsenic (crystallized)
and specimens of topaz and rhodochrosite from Japan were presented by K. Kato,
of Tokyo. Two specimens of the new mineral, wellsite, and other material were
transmitted by Mr. J. H. Pratt, of Chapelhill, North Carolina. Dr. L. T. Cham-
berlain presented to the Smithsonian Institution, for addition to the Lea collection,
two cut sapphires from Yogo Gulch, Montana, and an opal; also 21 cut sapphires of
assorted colors, 2 garnets (var. rhodolite), and 1 specimen of citrine quartz (cut).
Four cut opals were purchased from Messrs. Tiffany & Co.

A series of rocks illustrating the Pre-Cambrian geology of the Lake Superior
region was received from the Geological Survey. This material was obtained by Mr.
C. R. Van Hise. Geological material from Italy and Sicily was acquired by pur-
chase. Mr. Charles Burdett Hart, minister of the United States to Colombia, pre-
sented to the Smithsonian Institution specimens of ores from the Zancudo mines,
near Medellin, Colombia. Specimens of jointed sandstones from the Black Hills of
South Dakota, transmitted to the Geological Survey by Mr. N. H. Darton, Wash-
ington, District of Columbia, were transferred to the Museum. From Mr. James D.
Husted, Kansas City, Kansas, 3 slabs of onyx marble were received. The late
Prof. O. C. Marsh presented a series of 19 polished spheres of Japanese breccia.

Foreign exchanges.—Important exchanges were arranged with the following estab-
lishments and individuals: The British Museum, London, England; the Museum
of Natural History, Paris, France; the Geological-Paleontological Institute, Munich,
Germany; the Geological Survey of Canada, Ottawa; the Rijks Ethnographic
Museum, Leyden, Holland; the Public Gardens and Plantations, Botanical Depart-
ment, Kingston, Jamaica; the Museum Michoacana, Morelia, Mexico; the Albany

sity of Turin; Prof. M. F. Colunga, Lima, Peru; Mr. L. Y. Ayson, Masterton, Wel-
lington, New Zealand.

Distribution of specimens.—Nearly 25,000 specimens were distributed during the
year. A portion of these were sent in exchange for other material and the remainder
were distributed to educational establishments as gifts. In addition nearly 10,000
specimens were lent for study. The gifts consisted mainly of collections of marine
invertebrates, rocks, and ores, and casts of prehistoric stone implements.

Specimens received for determination.—As in past years, a very great deal of time has
been devoted to the identification of material transmitted by correspondents for
examination. Five hundred and eighteen lots of material have been reported upon
by the various curators during the year just ended. A small number of specimens,
desirable for addition to the’ Museum collections, have been retained, with the
consent of the senders, in exchange for the work of identification.

7isitors.— During the year 192,471 visitors were registered in the Museum building
and 116,912 in the Smithsonian building, making a total of 309,383, showing an
increase over the record of the preceding year of about 33,000.

Publications—The Annual Report of the National Museum for 1896 has been
issued and the papers in the appendix have also been published in separate form.
Volume 20 of the Proceedings was issued in August, 1898. Proceedings papers 1140
to 1178, inclusive, constituting volume 21, have been distributed since the beginning
of the last fiscal year. The editions of parts 2 and 3 of Bulletin 47, entitled ‘‘The
Fishes of North and Middle America,’’ by Drs. Jordan and Evermann, were received
from the Government Printing Office late in the fall of 1898, and have also been
distributed. The complete work will include an atlas of plates.

Expositions.—The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, which opened
at Omaha on June 1, 1898, continued for five months. The Report of the National
Museum for 1898 contains a brief reference to the various series of exhibits prepared
by the Museum. A more formal and extended account will probably appear else-
where. Congress has made provision for participation by the Museum in exposi-
tions to be held at Buffalo in 1901 and at Toledo in 1902 or 1903.

AppeENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN
ETHNOLOGY FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1899.

Sir: I have the honor to ask attention to the following report of operations of the
Bureau of American Ethnology for the year ending June 30, 1899. The operations
have been conducted in accordance with an act of Congress making provision ‘‘ for
continuing researches relating to the American Indians, under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution,’’ approved July 1, 1898.

The work has been carried forward in accordance with a plan-of operations sub-
mitted on June 18, 1898, and duly approved by the Secretary.

Field operations have been conducted in Arizona, California, Indian Territory,
Maine, Nebraska, New Brunswick, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, and Ontario,
while researches have been made by special agents in Alaska and Patagonia. The
office work has included the collection and preparation of material from Indian
tribes in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indian Territory, Iowa,
Nebraska, New Brunswick, New York, Oklahoma, Ontario, and in less quantity
from the several States and Territories, as well as from neighboring countries.

As heretofore, the work has been conducted in accordance with a classification of
ethnic science based largely on the special researches of the last two decades and
developed largely in this Bureau. This classification has been set forth at length in
previous reports and need not be repeated.

FIELD RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION.

Early in the fiscal year the Director resumed the study of shell mounds and earth-
works in Maine, and continued the comparison of aboriginal handiwork contained
in these accumulations with the handicraft of the partially accultured aborigines
still living in the adjacent forests and among the less frequented inlets and islands of
the coast. Some of the results were put in the form of a preliminary paper on
‘Technology, or the Science of Industries,’’ designed for further elaboration and
incorporation in the formal reports.

Under a special authorization from the Secretary, Mr. W J McGee and Mr. W. H.
Holmes, of the U. 8. National Museum, made an extended ethnologic and archeo-
logic reconnoissance in California during October, November, and December. The
districts examined comprised the western slopes and foothills of the Sierra Nevada,
including the Table Mountain region from Yuba River southward to Tule River; a
portion of the northern Coast Range region, centering about Ukiah; typical portions
of the Sacramento Valley, centering about Stockton, and the coastwise areas and
offshore islands of the southwestern region of the State. The primary purpose
was the collection of typical artifacts representing the aboriginal culture of the
peculiarly interesting Pacific coast province; a secondary purpose was the collection
of prehistoric relics, the comparison of these with the early historical period, and
the general study of the culture history of the region; and a satisfactory degree
of progress was made in the attainment of both purposes. The operations resulted
in substantial enrichment of the Museum through the acquisition of new and repre-
sentative material; indirectly the opportunities for local work led to the acquisition

34
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5)

of a highly useful collection of basketry—the Hudson collection,—which throws
much light on the aboriginal handicraft and motives of the California Indians.

In November Dr. J. Walter Fewkes repaired to Arizona for the purpose of con-
tinuing researches concerning the winter ceremonies of the Hopi Indians, but soon
after his arrival an epidemic of smallpox manifested itself in such severity as com-
pletely to demoralize the Indians and prevent them from carrying out their cere-
monial plans, and at the same time to place Dr. Fewkes in grave personal danger.
It accordingly became necessary to abandon the work for the season.

Early in the fiscal year an arrangement was effected with the managers of the
Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, at Omaha, under which Mr. James
Mooney cooperated, for the installation and conduct of an Indian congress. In car-
rying out the plan, Mr. Mooney visited Indian Territory and Oklahoma, and suc-
cessfully enlisted the sympathy and aid of representatives of various tribes, including
the Kiowa, with whom he was intimately acquainted. Portions of the aboriginal
material obtained in the field for the use of the congress were subsequently acquired
for the National Museum.

In August Dr. Albert 8. Gatschet revisited New Brunswick for the purpose of con-
tinuing the collection and analysis of Algonquian linguistic material. He sought new
aboriginal informants and was able to make satisfactory additions to the recorded
dialects of the measurably distinct portion of the great Algonquian stock occupying
the northern Atlantic coast.

In September Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt proceeded to various localities in New York
and Ontario for the purpose of obtaining additional material pertaining to both the
languages and the myths of the Iroquoian Indians, and the work, coupled with
efforts to obtain certain unique objects for the National Museum, occupied him in
the field until January.

During the autum Mr. J. B. Hatcher, who had previously brought from Patagonia
certain valuable ethnologic material for the Museum, returned to the field and
resumed collecting and the making of photographs illustrating the habits and hab-
itations of the Tehuelche tribe and the natives of Tierra del Fuego. His work was
not completed at the end of the year.

Dr. Willis E. Everett, acting as a special agent of the Bureau, visited various remote
districts in Alaska and contiguous British territory during the year, and obtained a
quantity of linguistic data of considerable use in classifying the aboriginess of a little-
known district.

OFFICE RESEARCH.

WORK IN ESTHETOLOGY.

Throughout much of the year the Director continued giving attention to the
synthesis of data in the Bureau archives and in published form, with the view of
organizing anthropic science, including ethnology in its several aspects. Among the
subjects considered in detail was that of the more spontaneous human activities,
normally pleasurable in character, which form the object-matter of esthetology.
The researches among the aborigines have thrown much light on this subject, since
the symbolic devices, sports, games, and ceremonies of the tribesmen are relatively
simple and little differentiated, and hence are readily perceived and synthesized—
indeed the synthesis of the esthetic and other activities rests primarily on the obser-
vations among the American natives, corroborated by critical observations on other
primitive peoples, and finally attested by the facts manifested among advanced
peoples. It is convenient to denote the primary activities comprised in the domain
of esthetology as pleasures, since they are largely physiologic in character, though,
like other activities, chiefly demotic (or collective) in their manifestations; and the
activities may be classed as ambrosial pleasures, decoration, athletic pleasures or
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sports, games, and fine arts. The definitions and the classification of esthetology
have been formulated and printed in such manner as to facilitate examination and
further discussion on the part of the collaborators of the Bureau and other students,
with a view to final revision and incorporation in a future report, embracing the
more systematic results of the researches.

In continuing his researches concerning the collections made in the Florida muck-
beds, Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing has been lec to comparative study of a wide
range of those products of primitive handicraft expressing symbolic ideas in form,
function, and decoration; and certain of his generalizations are of much importance
in that they afford a satisfactory basis for the classification and interpretation of many
of the protean artifacts of primitive origin. His researches indicate that the primi-
tive implement-maker is actuated by a few dominant ideas, influenced largely by
habit, and measurably controlled by simple associations; so that the products of his
handiwork, when arranged by function and motive, may readily be grouped in a
limited number of categories, which are, at the same time, convenient and significant.
The type of ideative association is exemplified by the tomahawk-calumet, which is
at once a war weapon and an appurtenance of peace, and hence serves as a symbolic
expression of willingness for war and readiness for peace, at the option of the other
party; the war concept is emphasized by decorative motives, usually derived from
strong and swift animals, while the peace concept is strengthened by emblems in the
form of feathers of small birds or other decorative symbols derived from gentle ani-
mals; and the antithetic symbolism serves to keep alive the opposing sentiments of
amity and enmity in the primitive mind. In this and other cases, the recognition of
motive on the part of the maker enables the student to reduce the chaos of protean
forms of primitive artifacts to definite order. Although his work has been somewhat
retarded by ill health, Mr. Cushing’s progress in researches has been satisfactory, and
some of his more important results are ready for publication.

When compelled to abandon fieldwork, for reasons already noted, Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes turned attention to the collections made during earlier seasons, and began
the preparation of a memoir on the decorative symbolism of Pueblo pottery. This
memoir was nearly ready for publication at the close of the fiscal year; it embraces
various new interpretations of importance, the account of which is reserved for a
future report.

WORK IN TECHNOLOGY.

As before noted, the Director made observations on the aboriginal technology
revealed in the contents of shell mounds and tumuli of Maine during the earlier part
of the fiscal year; and these observations, with other data, were subsequently utilized
in defining the science. The technical activities are intimately interrelated, and
combine to form a complex group, which is commonly assumed to be irresolvable
with scientific precision, but the relations of the activities are so well displayed in
primitive culture like that of the American aborigines as to suggest a convenient
arrangement for the use of investigators, and such an arrangement has been formu-
lated and placed within reach of the collaborators and others for subjection to the
test of actual use. In this arrangement, industries are classified as (1) simple pro-
duction or substantiation, (2) construction, (3) mechanics, (4) commerce, and (5)
the preservation, reconstruction, and improvement of the human body by a series
of processes conveniently connoted by the term medicine. Provision has been made
for completing and adding details to the outline already prepared, in a form suitable
for publication in a future report.

Mr. Cushing’s researches have served to illumine those early stages in the growth
of industries in which utility was but vaguely perceived, and in which processes were
largely ceremonial or symbolic, as when the hunter sought success by imitating the
attitude and actions, or by arming himself with the beak or claws of a raptorial
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. EE

tutelary. The researches conducted in the Bureau have already rendered it clear
that decoration, and indeed the greater portion of the fine arts, arises in symbolism
and develops through conventionism; and the researches of the year suggest a related
genesis for industries. The results of the work are in preparation for full publication.

While among the surviving aborigines of California, Mr. W J McGee was enabled
to make observations corroborating and extending generalizations already framed
with respect to those of the primitive industries involving the use of stoneas material
for implements. The several tribes studied may conveniently be classed as Acorn
Indians, since acorns form their principal source of food, and since their character-
istic industries are conditioned by this food supply. Some of the processes and
implements vary from tribe to tribe; e. g., in some tribes the acorns are cracked in
the teeth in order that the meats may be extracted, in others they are cracked with
spheroidal hammer-stones, and in still others an elongated pestle-like stone, grasped
by one hand and used in the fashion of a club or civilized hammer, is employed for
the same purpose. Other devices, such as those used for grinding the acorn meats,
are substantially alike from tribe to tribe; though it is noteworthy that in each tribe
there is a diversity growing out of the age of the apparatus, or the degree of develop-
ment by use. Thus it is found that the nether millstone, which may be either a ledge
or other mass in place of a portable bowlder, is, in the early stages of use, a flat or
slightly concave metate, which after more extended use becomes a deeply concave
metate, still later a shallow mortar, and at length a deep mortar which may event-
ually be worn through, if the original mass is not more than 9 to 15 inches in thick-
ness; while the grinding-stone concordantly changes from a simple roller or crusher
toa mano (or muller), and finally to a pestle, at first broad and short, but after-
wards long and slender. It follows that in this region the northerly device of the
mortar and the southerly device of the metate overlap; yet it is much more sig-
nificant that the overlapping is essentially genetic, and only incidentally geographic.
Not infrequently the genesis of an individual mill corresponds with the rise and
passing of a family; the young woman may begin life with a bowlder, flat on one
side, and a few river-worn cobbles as a mill, which is then used as a metate; gradu-
ally the mill develops into a mortar, with a well-rounded and polished pestle,
shaped chiefly by wear, perhaps supplemented by slight dressing, on which she
grinds vigorously in her old age for the support of her daughters and their hus-
bands, and the growing grandchildren; and on her death apparently the pestle is
broken and the bottom knocked out of the mortar. Neglecting the final act, the
individual growth of the primitive mill well epitomizes the phylogeny of its species,
and demonstrates that in general the mortar must be regarded as the differentiated
and eventually degraded offspring of a metate-like prototype, whence sprang also
the metate along one line and the quirn and its derivatives along another. It is par-
ticularly significant, too, that the milling apparatus still used by the Californian
natives consists initially of naturally-formed ledges or bowlders, with stream-worn
cobbles for grinders, and that both bowlder and cobble are, for the most part, shaped
gradually by wear, without definite recognition of the shaping on the part of the
operator—i. e., that the mills represent protolithiec culture, rather than the technoli-
thie art characterized by designs and models.

The plan for the Indian Congress at Omaha (mentioned in a preceding paragraph)
was formulated chiefly by Mr. James Mooney, in connection with Hon. Edward
Rosewater, president of the board of publicity and promotion of the exposition,
though conditions connected with administrative control and policing of the Indians
assembled on the grounds led to the assignment of a representative of the Indian
Bureau, Capt. W. A. Mercer, as officer in charge of the congress; but Mr. Mooney
cooperated in the installation and remained on the ground throughout the exposition.
In accordance with the plans of Messrs. Mooney and Rosewater, the Indians were
domiciled, so far as practicable, in houses or lodges of their own construction, and of
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

more or less strictly aboriginal type; accordingly the installation afforded an excel-
lent opportunity for the study of native house-building, and of the ceremonies con-
nected with the highly interesting house-cult of the native tribes. Among the lodges
were two Blackfeet skin tents, made and decorated in aboriginal fashion in every
respect, save that cow hides were substituted for buffalo hides. A lodge of special
nature was a Wichita grass house, which faithfully exemplified the aboriginal con-
struction, since the structure was an actual example, the oldest in the Wichita village
in Indian Territory, repaired, taken down, and reconstructed by aged men and women
conversant with the house-cult of the tribe. At the close of the exposition this spec-
imen was obtained for the National Museum. These and other structures erected at
Omaha and carefully studied by Mr. Mooney have added materially to the knowl-
edge of aboriginal houses.

The researches in California by Messrs. McGee and Holmes extended to basketry
and added materially to knowledge of the processes of basket making, especially
among the Pomo and Yokai tribes. The Hudson basketry collection comprises exam-
ples of twelve different weaves, which have been carefully studied by the collector,
Dr. J. W. Hudson, and are described fully in his catalogue; and, in addition, several
processes were critically studied in actual use by basket makers. The functions or
purposes of the baskets also received careful attention. In this region they form the
common utensils of the householders, taking the place sometimes filled by fictile ware
and serving various other purposes. They are used as cups, canteens, and other water
vessels, as pots for boiling acorn meal and meats (by means of heated stones), as
receptacles for stored foods and liquids, and especially as ceremonial and sacramental
objects. The researches concerning the aboriginal basketry of California promise
important results along different lines as the work proceeds.

WORK IN SOCIOLOGY.

The synthesis of activities by the Director extended into the domain of institutions
during the year, and the science was characterized and formulated in a preliminary
way; but, since the institutional activities are still more complex than the industrial
activities, and since the data available in the archives of the Bureau are exceedingly
voluminous, the formulation was not completed at the end of the fiscal year, and the
results are reserved for future presentation.

In the course of his researches among the California Indians, Mr. McGee obtained
certain data tending to explain the linguistic diversity which so strongly distinguishes
the Pacific coast province from the major portion of the continent—a diversity
expressed by the fact that four-fifths of the area of the continent are represented on
linguistic maps by only about one-fifth of the linguistic stocks, while the remaining
four-fifths of the stocks are concentrated in less than one-fifth of the area skirting
the Pacific coast. In the first place, various indications were found that the human
period in this region has been relatively short, or at least relatively uniform and
uneventiul; for, while most portions of the country reveal some evidences of culture
succession, the Californian region reveals but a single culture type in the relatively
rare artifacts scattered over the surface or still in use among the tribal remnants; so
that, on the whole, the region impresses the student as one of either short or slow,
and, in any event, relatively slight, demotic development. In the second place, it
was ascertained that the tongues of the several tribes are in exceptional degree held
as esoteric or sacred. It iscommon among all primitive peoples to surround personal
names and ceremonial terms with more or less secrecy or mystery, but it is not
common to similarly guard and sanctify ordinary speech; but the Californian tribes
subjected to study apparently hold as sacred not merely personal names, but the
name of the tribe and many if not all the common terms of their language—indeed,
it would appear that they regard language as forming the primary basis of their
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

social organization, or at least as a tangible and definite expression of consanguineal
relation. A third factor in the organization of the Californian aborigines grows out
of their industrial status. Sinee their chief food source is the acorn, and since the
oak trees never grow in continuous forests, but are somewhat sparsely distributed
among other trees or over the openings of the valleys, the native population was
necessarily sparse and scattered, and each tribe tended to remain permanently
attached to a definite range; and this sparse distribution permitted and promoted
the retention of tribal dialects corresponding to each range. A fourth factor appears
in ceremonial observances, apparently growing out of the industrial condition,
notably the affine taboo which prohibits communication between sons-in-law and
mothers-in-law, and among some of the tribes between daughters-in-law and fathers-
in-law and other connections by marriage. The linguistic and industrial ceremonial
factors all operate as repulsive forces tending to prevent aggregation of population
and intercommunication of tribes, and hence to retard cultural development; and it
would appear that the several factors, interacting with cumulative effect, have com-
bined to produce the singular concentration of linguistic stocks in the Pacific coast
region. The researches concerning this subject are not yet complete.

During the earlier part of the fiscal year Mr. Mooney continued researches relat-
ing to the Kiowa Indians, and noted as a conspicuous characteristic of the tribe the
apparent absence of a clan or gentile system; for, despite his intimate acquaintance
with and adoption into the tribe, he has never been able to discover unmistakable
traces of this commonly prominent feature of primitive social organization. This pecu-
liar characteristic has received attention by the Director and several of the collabora-
tors, and an apparently satisfactory explanation has been discovered: On reviewing
the tribal customs it became evident that the widely roving Kiowa enjoyed contact
with other tribes, and consequent acculturation in an exceptional if not unique
degree. Sometimes the association was amicable, when ideas and devices were freely
interchanged; not infrequently the contact was inimical, when the Kiowa were com-
monly enriched by the acquisition, not only of plunder, but of captives who were
subsequently adopted into the tribe; and the general effect of the wide association
was to extend the intellectual range and differentiate the blood of the Kiowa.
Especially important was the habitual adoption of captives, the effect of which is
always to introduce arbitrary relationships tending to break down the natural kin-
ship system; yet hardly less important were the oft-recurring excursions for hunting
and plunder, since they involved more or less arbitrary extensions of the consan-
guineal organization, somewhat analogous to those attending the development of
patriarchy among regularly nomadic peoples. Cotlectively, the consequences of the
roving and predatory habits of the Kiowa must have been to subordinate, in excep-
tional if not unique degree, the prevailing kinship organization characteristic of
primitive society and to gloss or even to replace it with the more strictly artificial
or demotic system corresponding to that of higher culture. The results of these
researches concerning the distinctive organization of the Kiowa will be incorporated
in Mr. Mooney’s memoir on the heraldic system of the tribe.

WORK IN PHILOLOGY.

Toward the end of the fiscal year the Director made some progress in systemizing
the rich linguistic collections in the archives of the Bureau, witha view to formulat-
ing plans for further research concerning the aboriginal tongues of America; but the
results are not yet ready for announcement.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt continued the collection of Iroquoian material, both linguistic
and mythologic, and has made satisfactory progress in preparing material for publi-
cation. His studies illustrate the importance of combining inquiries concerning prim-
itive myths with linguistic inquiries. Thus certain puzzling inflections introduced in
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

various terms eluded the best efforts toward analysis throughout the earlier portion
of the year; but, on studying the creation myths with the aid of native informants
in the course of his field operations, he ascertained that these obscure inflections
connote a characteristically primitive notion concerning individual activity or power;
e. g., the shaman is supposed to work magic by the sound of his rattle or drum, and
the witch to work her evil charms by the action of singing, both acquiring their
mystical powers only by and through the supposedly mystical exercise of function
in producing the sound, and it is the purpose of some of the obscure linguistic inflec-
tions to denote the mystical states recognized in the mythology. It is well known
that the aboriginal languages possess inflections for normal states, such as sitting,
standing, reclining, moving, ete., but the recent researches show that there are
inflections also for mystical states, and that some of these quite significantly corre-
spond with the inflections for singing or dancing. A preliminary announcement of
results has been made, and formal publication will follow so soon as the inquiry can
be considered complete.

Dr. Albert 8. Gatschet continued the preparation of the comparative vocabulary
of the Algonquian stock, and at the same time, according to custom, compiled
linguistic material for use in reply to numerous inquiries from correspondents for.
aboriginal terms to be applied to parks, vessels, villages, etc., and for the meaning
or etymology of aboriginal terms already in use. The field operations of the year
materially enriched the comparative vocabulary, which has already attained such
volume and completeness as to yield standards for classifying the tribes comprised
in the extensive stock to which it pertains.

Working under a small allotment, Dr. Franz Boas has continued the preparation
of linguistic material collected among the tribes of northwestern United States and
contiguous Canadian territory. The principal contributions of the year comprise a
complete Tsimshian vocabulary and a considerable collection of texts. The texts
are in form for publication, and will be transmitted with the next report.

During the year the Bureau was so fortunate as to obtain, through the courteous
offices of Dr. Edward Everett Hale, the vocabulary of the Massachusetts (Natick)
language laboriously prepared by the late J. Hammond Trumbull, and good progress
has been made in arranging the material for publication.

WORK IN SOPHIOLOGY.

Throughout the history of the Bureau, it has been the policy to organize the lines
of research in such manner as to permit comparative study of well-defined categories
of activities and activital products. The maintenance of this policy has been particu-
larly difficult in connection with the science of opinions, or sophiology, since the
object matter of the science is more elusive and complex than that of any other
branch of knowledge; yet fair progress has been made in the introduction of the
comparative method in even this branch of inquiry. During the year Mr. J. N. B.
Hewitt has made an important comparative study of the creation myths of several
Iroquoian tribes and of two or three Algonquian tribes. The results, which are of
much interest, are practically ready for publication. The comparative method has
been used with success also by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in the interpretation of the
symbolism depicted on the pottery of the Hopi and other Pueblo people, while the
results attained by Mr. Cushing in his technologie researches were made tangible
only by constant use of the comparative method in seeking the mystical motives of
the primitive artisans. Progress has been made by the director in formulating the
method for the guidance of future inquiries.

Although retarded by ill-health, Mrs. M. C. Stevenson made substantial progress
in her analysis and discussion of Zufi mythology during the year, and the portions
of her memoir already completed have been withheld from publication pending the
revision made necessary by further researches concerning certain of the ceremonies.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

Toward the close of the fiscal year Mr. McGee undertook an inquiry concerning
certain mystical symbols, such as that known as the swastika, so common among the
decorative devices of the American aborigines, and these graphic devices were com-
pared with the mystical number systems involved in the primitive cult of the quar-
ters. The investigation served to indicate that neither finger counting nor quinary
and decimal number systems are primitive, but are products of binary and quarter-
nary systems, modified through magnification of the ego in the manner described in
previous reports. The inquiry also afforded useful results bearing on the develop-
ment of right-handedness and on the orientation instinct which survives even in the
highest culture stages. A preliminary announcement is made, but the principal
results are reserved for incorporation in a report dealing with the time concept of the
Papago tribe.

Toward the close of the year Dr. Cyrus Thomas was also led to a comparison of the
number systems of the northern tribes with those revealed in the codices and other
aboriginal records of Mexico, and began the preparation of a memoir on the subject,
designed for incorporation in the next report.

After his return from Omaha, at the close of the Exposition, Mr. Mooney began
arranging for publication his extensive collections of Cherokee myths, and by the
end of the year he had the greater part of his voluminous data arranged in form for
publication, and was engaged in search for parallels in the records comprised in the
archives of the Bureau, as well as in the published literature. His memoir will be
incorporated in the next report submitted.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

Mr. F. W. Hodge continued supervision of the material for the Cyclopedia of Indian
Tribes and made such additions to the work as his duties in other directions permitted.
Dr. Cyrus Thomas spent the greater part of the year in reviewing and extending the
portion of the work relating to the tribes of the Siouan stock. His progress in exam-
ining the extensive literature involved and preparing the material for publication was
satisfactory. During a portion of the year Col. F. F. Hilder, ethnologic translator,
was occupied in translating archaic Spanish records of especial value in connection
with the Cyclopedia. One of these is a manuscript written in 1782, describing the
tribes of Texas with unequaled fulness. The manuscript is anonymous, but Colonel
Hilder has succeeded in identifying the author as Padre Morfi.

COLLECTIONS.

Among the special collections made during the year were those of Messrs. McGee
and Holmes in California, comprising stone artifacts in considerable number and
variety, basketry, etc., the collections being of special value in that they represent
typical prehistoric workmanship and typical modern workmanship combined, and in
that they were made on the ground by experts in archeologic and ethnologic research.
Another collection of special interest, though of somewhat limited extent, was made
in southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego by Mr. J. B. Hatcher; a portion of the
material was received during the year. A number of typical collections made by
correspondents of the Bureau and others were also acquired during the year. One of
these includes the Wichita house and house furniture obtained by Mr. Mooney, as
indicated elsewhere; another is the suit and regalia of Kahkenaquonaby (afterwards
called Dr. Peter Edward Jones), a member of the Messissauga tribe of the Ojibwa;
a third isa small but rare and significant lot, including a beautiful example of the
stone yoke, or ceremonial collar, obtained from Mexico through the ageney of Mr.
Holmes.
492 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
PROPERTY.

The property of the Bureau was classified and described in some detail in a pre-
vious report. During the past year a number of manuscripts have been added to
the archives, chiefly by contribution from correspondents, and others have been
produced. The collection of photographs of Indian subjects has been materially
enlarged, partly through photographing the individuals and groups of Indian del-
egations to Washington; while the library has increased at a normal rate, chiefly
through exchanges.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Library and publications—Mr. F. W. Hodge has remained in charge of the library,
and has also continued editorial work on the reports. During the year he outlined
a plan of library arrangement on the basis of the classification of anthropic science
set forth in this and preceding reports, thus preparing the way for a systematic cata-
logue for the use of the collaborators and the many visitors to the Bureau. The
editorial work of the year has been especially arduous by reason of the considerable
volume of matter in the hands of the printer and the number and elaborateness of ,
the accompanying illustrations; but his work has been performed with energy and
ability.

Translation.—During a considerable part of the year Col. F. F. Hilder has been
employed as ethnologice translator, and, in addition, has performed the duties of
chief clerk. One of his translations is noted in an earlier paragraph; others made
from time to time as needs arose have greatly facilitated the preparation of the Cyclo-
pedia of Indian Tribes, the researches concerning the Seri and Papago Indians, and
other lines of work.

Illustrations. —Mr. De Lancey W. Gill has remained in charge of the photographic
laboratory and of the preparation of illustrations by other than photographic means,
and the progress of his work has been highly satisfactory. The additions to the
photographic negatives representing Indian visitors to Washington and the work of
field parties have been unprecedented.

I have the honor to be, yours, with respect,
J. W. Powe tu, Director.

Mr. 8. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
SERVICE FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1899.

T have the honor to present herewith the report upon the operations of the Inter-
national Exchange Service for the year ending June 30, 1899.

This service continues to occupy the several rooms in the eastern basement of the
Smithsonian Institution which were prepared for its use about six years ago. As
the work conducted is chiefly clerical in character, these quarters are fitted up as
business offices, being furnished with the requisite desks, sorting tables and bins,
book shelves, filing cases for letters, invoices and receipt cards, typewriter, maps,
directories, etc. The property acquired during the year has consisted mainly of
expendable materials used in the shipment of exchanges and in connection with the
office work, such as packing boxes, lumber and hardware, wrapping paper, twine,
and stationery. All structural repairs are made by the Smithsonian Institution, but
asmall amount from the Exchange appropriation was expended for improving the
facilities for handling packages and for other necessary minor changes.

The only losses to be recorded for the year were of two shipments of exchanges.
One consisted of a case of United States Government documents destined for Uruguay,
damaged by the foundering of the steamship Bellova; the other of five cases of mis-
cellaneous exchanges which were lost by the sinking of the steamer La Bourgogne
through collision with the ship Cromartyshire on July 4, 1898. It has, fortunately,
been possible to obtain and forward duplicates of nearly all the publications so
destroyed.

As to the extent of'the operations of the service during the past twelve months, it
may be said that the total number of packages from all sources received and shipped
aggregated 97,835, being 13,627 in excess of the number handled the year before, an
increase of 16.18 per cent. The total weight of the shipments for 1899 was 317,883
pounds, an increase of 5.4 per cent as compared with 1898. Of the number of pack-
ages named, 58,640 were dispatched abroad from domestic sources, while 39,195 were
received from abroad, Departments and bureaus of the United States Government
furnished 33,001 of the former and received 16,554 of the latter.

A small increase in the appropriation permitted certain much-desired improve-
ments to be made in connection with ocean transportation, whereby greater dispatch
in forwarding and more frequent shipments were rendered possible. Much. still
remains to be accomplished in this direction, however, before the service can be
expected to reach the standard of efficiency expected of it, and at which the Insti-
tution has always aimed. It is pleasing, therefore, to note a second increase in the
appropriation, to become available on July 1, 1899, which will afford the means for
still further adyancement along the lines in question.

The number of separate shipments made during 1899 was 567, as against 219 for
1898. The additional labor which this involved was entirely performed by the reg-
ular force of clerks and packers, though not without its being severely overtaxed at
times.

Through the cooperation of the American minister to Athens exchange relations
with Greece, which had been suspended since the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish

43
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

war, were resumed in 1898, and on March 4 last the transmission of official
exchanges to Turkey, which had also been interrupted, was renewed. Negotiations
are in progress with China, Costa Rica, and Japan looking toward a more systematic
interchange of public documents with the two former countries and the perfecting
of means for the local distribution of miscellaneous publications in the latter.

Upon the outbreak of hostilities between Spain and the United States all trans-
missions between the two countries were necessarily suspended, the restriction
placed upon the postal service and the refusal on the part of steamship companies
to accept freight for Spanish ports making any other course impossible. Steps have
already been taken toward reestablishing this service, which, it is hoped, will soon
be in full operation. Exchanges for Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, formerly
sent through Madrid, are now forwarded directly to those islands.

In the last report mention was made of the establishment of agencies at Vienna,
Austria, and Budapest, Hungary. After a trial of nine months with the former and
of seventeen months with the latter, it is gratifying to report that the benefits have
been even greater than was anticipated.

Great Britain and Germany still occupy, in the order named, the foremost posi-
tions among the patrons of the Exchange Service, both as to the number of corre-
spondents and the quantity of their contributions. In each of these countries the
Smithsonian Institution has agents in its own employ, Messrs. William Wesley &
Son in London and Dr. Felix Fligel in Leipzig, whose long connection with the
service is a sufficient guaranty of their devotion to its interests.

The following improvements and repairs have been made: The building tempo-
rarily used as an aquarium has been more fully fitted with skylights at an expense
of $400; to secure a proper supply of water for the aquarium it was necessary to con-
struct two wells and to lay water pipe from them to the building; the expense of
this was $300; tin roofing was placed on portions of the animal house and of the
antelope house, at a cost of $450; the walls of the office building have been under-

Most of the deaths have been of small animals, birds and reptiles, many of them
dying from lack of suitable quarters.

The important losses were few, the principal ones being as follows: The elephant
Golddust, who, after an illness of some months, died of chronic enteritis. The ostrich
belonging to the park died from excessive feeding in hot weather, and three sea lions
and seven harbor seals died from the ill effects of the exceedingly muddy condition
of the water in their pond. An effort has been made to lessen this evil by cleaning
and graveling the bottom, but until some arrangement is made for filtering the water
flowing into the pond good results with these animals can not be expected. Two of
the prong-horn antelope died of a disorder very similar to, if not identical with, the
dreaded pest known as the ‘‘cattle and game disease,’’ that has made great ray-
ages in foreign zoological gardens. Fortunately, this did not spread to the other
herbivora.

Some important exchanges of animals have been effected during the year. Through
the kindness of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell the Director of the Zoological Garden
at Tokyo, Japan, Dr. Ishikawa, sent twelve beautiful mandarin ducks, which are a
valuable addition to the collection. In return six raccoons were sent, which have
arrived at their destination in good condition. The director of the Central Park
menagerie, Mr. John W. Smith, sent for exchange a nilgai and two zebus. Eight
harbor seals were received from Mr. J. H. Starin, the proprietor of Glen Island; a
camel from the board of public park commissioners, Baltimore, and a fine tigress and
ared kangaroo from Mr. William Bartels.

Two lionesses, two zebu cows, and a male axis deer were deposited by the proprie-
tor of the Barnum & Bailey Shows.

I wish to call attention to the advantage that has accrued to the park from the
temporary loan of animals. Eight lion cubs have been born, which, under the agree-
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ment made with the owners of the lionesses, became the property of the park.
When these young animals arrive at a suitable age they are readily exchanged for
other specimens, and thus form a valuable addition to the resources of the park.

In accordance with:a design long ago formed by the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, means were instituted during the year for interesting officers of the United
States stationed abroad in the objects and needs of the National Zoological Park. A
circular to officers was prepared showing a map of the park and illustrated with views
taken at various points within it. By permission of the Secretaries of State, of War,
and of the Navy, copies of this circular were sent to the principal officers on foreign
stations. It is expected that considerable accessions to the collection will be made
from this source. The circular is reprinted in subsequent pages.

In anticipation of this circular the Navy Department instructed Commander Todd,
U. S. N., the officer commanding the U. S. 8. Wilmington, who was about to make a
voyage up the Amazon River, to make such collections as were practicable for the
park. The result was most satisfactory. A considerable consignment of animals
was made from the Wilmington, including a fine male tapir, a harpy eagle, and a
number of monkeys, birds, and small mammals. An illustration of the eagle is
appended.

The sea-lion pond and the lower ford were materially injured by high water at fe
breaking up of the ice in the winter. Damage of this sort is certain to occur occa-
sionally, and may be very serious if not guarded against by riprapping the bank.
The elk inclosures and the pond for the pelicans just above the high bridge have
been greatly damaged by the wash of sand and dirt from the fresh-cut bank along
the eastern boundary. This bank, on the top of which is a newly constructed road-
way, known as Park Drive, will remain a cause of expense tothe park until steps are
taken to prevent this wash. This could be done by planting the banks thickly, but
to produce the best results and make a permanent improvement the bank should be
made less precipitous and the slope extended into the park itself. As this improve-
ment would benefit the park alone, it must be done, if ever, at public expense. The
cost would be about $10,000, and 1 would recommend that Congress be asked to
appropriate a sum for this purpose.

Now that roadways leading into the park have been completed at grades estab-
lished by the District authorities, it is desirable to surround the entire domain by a
tight fence which will keep out dogs and other predatory animals, and thus make it
possible to keep small game at Jarge in the park—pheasants, woodcock, grouse, and
quail, for instance. The estimated cost of such a fence with suitable gates at the
entrances is $20,000.

At the request of the Capital Traction Railway Company a new entrance to the
park has been made upon the south side to accommodate those who desire to enter
by the pathway laid out by this company from the railway ‘‘loop”’ at the eastern
end of the Cincinnati street bridge, where a freight station and waiting room have
been established. It is not, however, much used. It would be greatly to the con-
venience of the public if a right of way could be acquired by which foot passengers
could proceed from this ‘‘loop’’ across the grounds owned by the colored cemetery
association to the Adams Mill road within the park. The distance is not great, being
not more than 300 feet, and the descent is easy.

The improvement of access to the park has greatly increased its use by the general
public. It is found to be of special importance to schools, and groups of children
under charge of teachers may be observed almost any fine day during the school
season. There are herewith appended two illustrations showing such groups.

By the act of March 3, 1899, there was appropriated $5,000 to widen the Adams
Mill road from Columbia road to the park entrance, and steps have been taken to
carry out this provision. ;

I desire to recommend an increase in the forte of watchmen. The establishment
of the railway loop at the bridge near the park has largely increased the number of |

visitors after the hour when the buildings are closed and the keepers and day watch-
men have left. Heretofore one night watchman has been deemed sufficient, but
another is now necessary from 4 p. m. to 12.

The circular letter and ‘‘ Advice to collectors’? alluded to in a previous page is
reprinted below, omitting most of the illustrations.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, U. S. A., July 1, 1899.

The Secretary, on behalf of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and with
the permission of the honorable the Secretaries of State, of War, and of the Navy,
calls the attention of officers of the United States on foreign stations to the fact that
there is at the capital a National Zoological Park, established by an act of Congress
approved April 30, 1890, which provides—

‘“That the National Zoological Park is hereby placed under the direction of the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, who are authorized to transfer to it any liy-
ing specimens, whether of animals or plants now or hereafter in their charge, to
accept gifts for the park at their discretion, in the name of the United States, to make
exchanges of specimens, and to administer the said Zoological Park for the advance-
ment of science and the instruction and recreation of the people.

‘“That the heads of the Executive Departments of the Government are hereby
authorized and directed to cause to be rendered all necessary and practicable aid to
the said Regents in the acquisition of collections for the Zoological Park.’’

This park, of which some idea may be formed by the accompanying map and illus-
trations,! has been established in an unusually beautiful site near the city of Wash-
ington. It is intended to form here a representative national collection which, while
especially rich in our native American animals, shall also contain specimens from all
parts of the world, and shall be to America what the zoological gardens at London,
Paris, and Berlin are to their respective countries.

For several years Congress made no appropriation for the purchase of animals, and
the park is still largely dependent upon gifts to increase the collection, which is far
from adequate as an exhibit in a national institution.

li officers stationed abroad, who may be interested in animal life, would bear in
mind the necessities of the park, many additions could be made to the collection.
Almost any foreign animals would be gladly received.

Expenses of boxing and of land transportation, where necessary, will always be
paid by the Zoological Park.

Purchase of animals can be made only in exceptional cases, but if the opportunity
for any especially desirable acquisition arises, the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution would be pleased to be advised by letter, or in urgent cases by telegraph.
The Secretary would also be glad to correspond with officers who expect to visit
regions where interesting animals occur.

Public recognition of gifts is made, the names of donors being placed upon the
labels attached to the cages or pens, and a notice of the gifts with the names of the
donors is also made a part of the annual report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution.

A list of the most important animals that can be collected in different countries is
appended hereto, and concise directions for boxing, shipping, and feeding are given.

8. P. Lana ey, Secretary.

ADVICE TO COLLECTORS.
ANIMALS ESPECIALLY DESIRED.

The new possessions of the United States are comparatively poor in animals, but
it is especially desirable to have as full a representation of the fauna as possible.
While all will be valued, those whose names are italicized are particularly desirable.
_ Cuba and Puerto Rico afford the manatee, or sea cow, which frequents bays and
mouths of rivers; the flamingo, spoonbill, ibis, pelican, several species of parrots
and parrakeets, a variety of pigeons, the ani, and other interesting birds. Boas of
several kinds occur in these islands, and large lizards of different species are very
abundant. The agouta (Solenodon) and the hutia (Capromys), animals a little larger
than a common rat, and the crocodile are also found in Cuba, and an interesting
macaw occurs in the Isle of Pines.

In the Philipine Islands the most notable mammals are the ‘‘tamarau,’’ a small
wild buffalo found on Mindoro; several species of deer; the ‘‘ babui,’’ or wild hog;

58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

monkeys of two species, a small cat; two species of civet cat, or musang; fruit-eating
bats of different species, several peculiar large rats; the colugo, or flying lemur, and
the very remarkable and interesting tarsier, or ‘“‘magou.’’ Among these the last two
and the ‘‘tamarau’’ are especially important. Specimens of the domesticated buffalo
also are desired.

Of the birds the eagles, hornbills, cockatoos, parrakeets, the pheasants and
pigeons, the megapod, pelican, and the ground cuckoos are perhaps the most
important. Among these any hornbills or brilliant-plumaged cockatoos and parrakeets
would be specially valued, but specimens of all the larger birds, of both land and
water, are desired. The python and other snakes, large lizards, and turtles would
also be acceptable.

Below are mentioned a few of the more notable animals to be found in other
regions and those which are especially desired.

Central America.—Tapir, manatee, West Indian seal, jaguar, other cats (except the
puma), monkeys, sloth, anteater, coati-mundi, tayra, kinkajou, tree porcupine, and
other large rodents, curassows, parrots and macaws, king vulture, flamingo, spoonbill,
ibis, crocodiles, large snakes, iguanas and other large lizards.

South America.—From the great river valleys of the east and north the following
animals are desired:

Tapir, sloth, anteaters, great armadillo, jaguar, other cats (except the puma), otter,
raccoon, wild dogs and foxes, deer, white-lipped peccary, monkeys and marmosets,
capybara, viscacha, paca, coypu, porcupine and other large rodents, curassows. of
various species, guans, tinamous, toucans, parrots and macaws, harpy and other
eagles, king vulture, cariama, screamers, jabiru, flamingo, spoonbill, scarlet ibis, and
other large wading birds, caimans, large snakes, and large lizards.

Farther to the south occur the guanaco, the Patagonian cavy, the rhea, or Ameri-
can ostrich, the coscoroba and black-necked swans, and several species of geese and
penguins, and among the mountains of Chile, Peru, and Bolivia are found the alpaca
and vicuna, the chinchilla, the rare spectacled bear, and the condor.

Asia.—Southern Asia and the adjacent islands afford the rhinoceros (three species) ,
elephant (female only is desired), tapir, buffalo, gayal, gaur, antelopes, gazelles,
deer, chevrotains and muntjacs, wild swine, tiger, leopard, cheetah and smaller cats,
ichneumons, civet cats, bears, orang, gibbons, langurs and related species, proboscis
monkey, macaques of various species, black ape, lemurs, and fruit-eating bats; also
eagles, vultures, hornbills, pheasants, Jungle fowl, tragopans, fruit pigeons, etc., and
crocodiles, pythons, and large poisonous snakes.

On the highlands of the interior are found a number of rare and superb mountain
sheep and antelopes, several of which, as the argali or Pamir sheep, the serow, and
takin, have never as yet been on exhibition in any American or European zoological
garden. The same region affords the musk deer, ounce or snow leopard, yak (female
chiefly desired), and rare pheasants. The Bactrian camel and the wild ass also may
be had there. In Japan may be had the Japanese bear, a deer, a peculiar goat ante-
lope, an interesting monkey, the raccoon-like dog, otter, badger, wild swine, and
pheasants.

Africa.—No other region is so rich in animal life as this continent, from which
are desired the elephant, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, zebra, quagga, buffalo, giraffe,
antelopes of any species, gazelles, the Abyssinian ibex, the ‘‘beden’”’ or Egyptian
ibex, the Barbary sheep or ‘‘arui,’’? water chevrotain, the wart hog and river hog,
lion, leopard, cheetah and any smaller cats, zorilla, ratel, genets, ichneumons, suri-
cate, Cape hunting dog and aard wolf, jackals, foxes, hyenas, gorilla, chimpanzee,
the chacma baboon and vervet monkey of South Africa, the gelada and hamadryas
baboons of Abyssinia, the mandrill, drill, and other baboons, several species of

colobus and mangabey, the green monkey, diana, mona, pluto, and other nearly ~

related species of West Africa, the Barbary ape, lemurs, fruit-eating bats, coney, aard
vark, and pangolin, eagles, vultures, secretary bird, parrots and parrakeets, hornbills,
doves, fruit pigeons, touracous, francolins, guinea fowls, bustards, the larger wading
and water birds, etc.; also the ostriches of Somaliland and North Africa.,, etc. croco-
diles, large tortoises, pythons, vipers,and other poisonous snakes, monitors and other
large lizards. The gorilla has never yet been brought to America. Special care
would have to be taken in boxing, feeding, and caring fora specimen. The giraffe
has almost ceased to be found in any European or American collection. The true
zebra of southern Africa is almost extinct. This region affords nearly one hundred
species of antelopes and gazelles, and any of these would be especially valued. The
secretary bird, though not rare, would be interesting; but any of the above would
be acceptable. :

Madagascar affords a wonderful variety of lemurs, the strange and interesting aye-
aye, fruit-eating bats, a peculiar cat-like animal known as the fossa, civet cats, the
river hog, several large snakes, and a number of desirable birds.

Harpy EAGLE IN ZOOLOGICAL PARK.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

Australia and adjacent islands.—Kangaroos and wallabies of any species, koala or
native ‘‘ bear,’’ wombat, thylacine, dingo, ‘‘ Tasmanian devil,’’? phalangers or opos-
sums, bandicoots, echidna or ‘‘spiny ant eater,’’ and platypus; cassowaries, emeu,
lyre bird, parrots, parrakeets, and cockatoos, fruit pigeons, megapod, brush turkey,
black swan, birds of paradise, etc., and large snakes and lizards. The living platy-
pus, or duckbill, is not represented in any American collection. It is somewhat
difficult to procure and demands particular care as to quiet and special food in trans-
port, but hardly any animal would excite so general an interest or reflect more credit
on its collector.

New Zealand.—Kiwi or apteryx, owl parrot, parrots, and tuatara lizard.

‘
BOXING.

General instructions.—The larger animals, all adult flesh-eating animals, and most
other species that are not gregarious should each be given a separate box or compart-
ment. The smaller monkeys may be shipped together, but the adults of the larger
species are likely to be ill natured and should be shipped separately, as should also
antelope, deer, and sheep, even though young. The young of most other animals
may be shipped together.

An illustration of a large shipping box is given above, and detailed plans of the
same are shown upon the opposite plate. Similar boxes varying in size according to
the size of the animals to be transported can readily be made by any fairly good
carpenter and blacksmith. All boxes should be high enough to allow the animals
confined in them to stand erect. The inside should be smooth, all cleats, ete.,
required to strengthen the box being put on the outside. Care should be taken that
no nails project inside. Except in metal-lined boxes, holes for ventilation should be
bored in the upper part of the box. No cracks should be left near the bottom, as
the animals would be liable to get their feet caught in them.

The space in front, between the grating and the bottom of the box, should be kept
closed by a removable footboard, except when the animals are being fed or watered.
The rear door should be kept locked, all feeding and cleaning being done through
the other openings.

A plan is given in the same plate of an iron scraper, which is the handiest imple-
ment for cleaning out the cages. It should be of a size and weight to suit the cages
in which it is to be used, the handle to be several inches longer than the cage.

These directions and the accompanying plan call for some materials that can only
be had from a well-appointed hardware store. It is to be expected that in many
cases such materials can not be obtained, and that the plans will then be varied to
suit the occasion, stout bars of wood taking the place of iron rods, slats being used
instead of wire netting, ete.

Lions, leopards, and other large cats—The box should be a little longer than the
animal and wide enough to permit it to turn around. The front end should be
closed by a grating of 32-inch vertical iron bars, 3 inches apart. A space of 3 inches
should be left between this grating and the bottom of the box, so that a water pan
and food may be passed in. There should also be a frame covered with stout wire
netting to fit over the grating on the outside and prevent the animal from reaching
out. The rear end should have an opening the full height of the box and wide
enough to admit the animal. This should be fitted with a door sliding down from
above. A little straw or other like material should be put in the box for bedding.

Bears.—Boxes for bears should be of the same style as for the large cats, but they
should be stouter and have a lining of sheet iron.

Deer, antelope, sheep, and goats.—Boxes for animals having horns and hoofs should
be long enough to permit their stepping back and forth, and of a width suflicient to
permit them to stand comfortably, but not to turn around. The upper part of the
front end should be made of slats an inch apart, and at the bottom should be a slid-
ing door 6 inches high and the full width of the box. The sliding door at the back
should be the full width of the box and high enough to admit the animal. Inside,
across the bottom, thin cleats, to give secure footing, should be nailed about 6 inches

-apart. Sand should be scattered on the bottom, and over this a little straw. No
cracks should be left between the boards except in front, as the horns might be
caught in them.

Kangaroos may be boxed in much the same manner as antelope, but the boxes
should be wide enough to allow the animals to turn around easily, and the rear door
be only wide enough to admit the animal.

Hippopotamus and rhinoceros.—Boxes should be wide enough to allow the animal
to sway from side to side, but not to turn around. The front end should be closed
with a grating of 1-inch vertical bars, 5 inches apart. Two or three stout planks set
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vertically, with 4 or 5 inches space between, will answer if iron bars can not be had.
A space of 5 or 6 inches should be left between this grating and the bottom.of the
box. There should be a stout bar across the rear end, with 4 inches space between
it and the bottom for cleaning out. The rear door, sliding up, should fill the entire
space above this bar. Cleats should be nailed across the bottom inside, a little sand
should be scattered on it, and over this a good bedding of straw or similar material.

A box for a rhinoceros should have the top, over the animal’s head, lined with
heavy sheet iron.

Tapirs and swine.—Boxes for these animals should be similar to the last, only
lighter, and with bars 3 inches apart and with 3 inches space at bottom, in front and
back.

Monkeys. —Boxes should be large enough to allow the animals to move about. The
front may be of heavy wire netting or a grating of light bars, with a space of 2 inches
at the bottom for putting in water pan and food and for cleaning out. A piece of
burlap or blanket should be tacked across the top edge in front, to be let down when
the temperature is low or the box is bemg moved. A little bedding of straw or simi-
lar material should be put in.

Monkeys bear transportation best when several are sent together, but any that are
vicious must be shipped by themselves.

Rodents. —Boxes tor gnawing animals should be similar to those for monkeys, but
lined with tin or sheet iron. Of most species it will be safe to put several individuals
together. é

Small cats, weasels, etc.—Boxes should be of sufficient size to permit free movement.
Front should be closed with stout wire netting or light iron grating, a space being
left at the bottom for food and water.

Birds.—Boxes for birds should have tight back and bottom. For the other three
sides and top a frame covered with wire netting will answer, burlap or other cheap
material being put over this to protect the birds from drafts. The front may be kept
uncovered except when the box is being moved.

Boxes for long-billed birds should have a door in the front so that a pail or other
deep vessel for water may be set inside.

Parrots and macaws require metal cages, as they quickly destroy wood.

Boxes for ostriches, emues, and cassowaries should be tight to a height of about 6
inches above the level of the bird’s back. Above that point the sides, and also the
top, should be made of slats, with the space between them so narrow that the bird
can not put its head through. The sides of the box should be padded up to the level
of the bird’s breast.

There should be a sliding door in one end of the box sufficiently large to admit the
bird, and this will also answer for putting in pail for water and feed.

Hay is most satisfactory for bedding, but other dry material of similar character
will answer. This bedding material should be cut into short lengths; otherwise the
bird will get it twisted about its feet.

Reptiles. Snakes may be shipped in boxes having tight sides and bottom and top
covered with small-mesh wire netting. An old blanket or some soft, dry grass should
be put into the box, also a little sand.

Iguanas and other lizards requre the same style of box as snakes. Dry sand only
should be put in the bottom. ;

FEEDING AND CARE.

General vnstructions.—It is not expected that the directions for feeding, given
below, can always be closely followed. It may happen that the articles specified are
not obtainable, and that others not mentioned, but equally good, can be had in -
abundance.

Whenever the animals to be shipped have been for some time in captivity it will
be advisable to obtain full information regarding the manner of caring for them, and
the food to which they have been accustomed.

Care should be taken that animals are net overfed; if they do not eat all that is
given them the quantity should be reduced at once. :

Such animals as antelope, deer, hippopotamus, ete., that have been fed on hay and
grain, will relish fresh grass and other green food when it is obtainable, but it should
be given in small quantities at first.

The cages should be cleaned each day, and all remnants of food should be removed
as soon as the animals finish eating.

Water should be given twice a day. The pan should be taken out when the
animal is through drinking. The pan is best put into the cage empty, then tilled
from a common sprinkling pot which has had the ‘‘rose’’ removed.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

Any animals that die should of course be removed at once.

Flesh-eating animals.—An adult lion or tiger requires about 10 pounds of meat,
including bone, once a day; a leopard or panther about 5 pounds; an ocelot or wild
cat 2} pounds; smaller animals in proportion. The meat should be given ‘‘on the
bone’’ whenever possible, as this compels the animal to eat slowly.

The cheetah requires very careful feeding, and it will be best, before shipping, to
secure a supply of live chickens or other fowls for its food while in transit.

Bears are omnivorous, and may be fed dry bread, biscuits, boiled rice with sugar,
vegetables, and fruit. They do not require meat.

The civet cat, ichneumon, coati, and kinkajou require bread and milk, boiled
rice, and milk with sugar, fruit, and a little meat. Small birds and mice will be
relished.

Insect-eating animals.—Anteaters and armadillos should have boiled milk beaten up
with raw egg. The great anteater will take from two to three pints, with two eggs,
and the small species one pint and one egg. They should also have raw meat finely
minced and entirely free from long fibers.

Vegetable-eating animals.— Antelope, deer, etc., require hay, oats, or dry bran and
oats mixed, and a little green food can be used when obtainable.

Hippopotamus and rhinoceros should be given hay, fresh green food when obtain-
able, carrots, beets, and other roots. Mixed bran and oats should also be fed, to be
moistened for the rhinoceros and thoroughly wet for the hippopotamus.

Tapirs require great care in feeding. Hay, straw, beets, or carrots cut up and
mixed with bran may be fed, also boiled rice or potatoes, sweet potatoes or yams,
bread, biscuits, boiled Indian corn with grass, cabbage leaves, and small branches of
trees. Constant care and watchfulness will be required to arrange a diet upon which
the animal will thrive.

Sloths require fruit, such as bananas, figs, etc., lettuce and other green food; also
bread and milk.

Kangaroos may be fed on hay, with oats and bran, roots of all kinds, and apples;
also green food, such as grass, cabbage leaves, and beet tops.

Rodents will eat green food, roots of any kind, apples, bread, biscuit, ete.

Birds.—Parrots of the larger kinds will eat Indian corn, oats, buckwheat, dry bis-
cuits, apples, pears, grapes, and the various tropical fruits; also lettuce, cabbage
leaves, and other green food. The smaller kinds require the same sort of food,
except that millet, hemp, and canary seed should be used instead of the larger kinds.

Marsh and water birds will eat small fish, or larger fish cut into small strips; also
fresh meat cut into small pieces.

Eagles, owls, and other birds of prey should have fresh meat and fish cut into
strips. Live birds, mice, and ratsshould be given them occasionally when obtainable.

Ostriches, emeus, and cassowaries require beets, carrots, and other roots, cut into
small pieces, cabbage leaves, lettuce, ete.; also a small quantity of oats and a very
little corn. The food should be varied from day to day as much as possible.

Reptiles.—Some lizards are exclusively vegetable feeders, while others eat only
insects, and in many cases it will be necessary to try them with different kinds of
food in order to ascertain what they require. For the iguanas and others requiring
vegetable food, lettuce, leaves of cabbage, mangroye, etc., and various fruits may be
used. Many of the insectivorous species will eat cockroaches and ants. Eggs, both
raw and hard boiled (minced finely), should be tried.

It will not be necessary to feed snakes while in transit, as most of them are able to
go for a considerable time without food. It is well, however, where it can con-
veniently be done, to feed them just before shipping. They should be sprinkled
with water once in every two or three days, when this can be done without wetting
the blanket.

REPORT OF THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1899.

Str: I prefix to the usual report an approximate statement of the present condition
of the Astrophysical Observatory:

1. The character and value of property in the possession of the Observatory—

(qa), Buildings... ... 2.25 2sces Sete se oo ees ee ee $6, 300
(b), Apparatus .2...5.s-s2 ese cos. eee eee ee eee ee eee 27, 700
(c): Library and records:.522.- 2 26:52 jo3=ee ese ee eee ee ee ee 5, 200

Total value of Observatory propertyiaa-o eee see ee ee eee eee eee 39, 200

2. Accessions and improvements of property in the period covered by this report—

(a) Buildings.—A corner of the main building has been enlarged and fitted up to
form a more commodious office and library, and a new laboratory building consist-
ing of one story and basement has been built. These additions were made from last
year’s appropriation, in accordance with authorization of Congress, at the cost of
32,300. The fence surrounding the Observatory has been enlarged and entirely
repainted, at a cost of $100; and repairs to plumbing made, at a cost of $25. Total
for buildings and repairs, $2,425.

(b) Apparatus.—Expenditures for astronomical and physical apparatus, $800. The
cooling plant and the automatic temperature-regulating system have been extended,
at a cost of $500. Fire-extinguishing apparatus has been procured, at a cost of $100.
Miscellaneous expenditures for apparatus, $100. Total for apparatus, $1,500.

(c) Library.—Books, periodicals, and illustrations have been procured, at an
expenditure of $200. Total accessions to value of property,’ $4,000.

3. Losses of property—

These have been trifling, and consist in wear and tear and accidental breakage to
the extent of $50.

THE WorK OF THE OBSERVATORY.

The work which has occupied the staff of the Observatory during the past year
has been very varied. The observations made have been in new fields, though to
some extent subsidiary to those of previous years. Much attention has been given
to preparing results for publication, and it is gratifying to be able to state that Volume
Tof the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory is at last in the hands of the printer.

For convenience in describing the work in detail, it may be divided into three
categories, as follows:

A. Observations.

B. Preparation for publication.

C. Miscellaneous matters.

A.— OBSERVATIONS.

The observations themselves may be considered under two heads:
1. On the dispersion of rock salt.
2. On miscellaneous subjects.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

(1) On the dispersion of rock salt.

This subject has been investigated by several observers, first by yourself at Alle-
gheny about 1886, and since then by Julius, Paschen, Rubens and Snow, and others.
The object of making a further study of it was to very materially increase the accu-
racy of determination in the infra-red portion of the spectrum, with the hope of
establishing the wave-lengths of the infra-red solar absorption lines discovered at this
Observatory to a degree of accuracy corresponding with the accuracy of our knowl-
edge of their minimum deviations in the spectrum of our great salt prism. There
appeared to be strong grounds for hope of succeeding in this endeavor, in the con-
sideration of the extraordinary facilities of the Observatory for such a research.

Accordingly, the apparatus was made ready in July and August of 1898, and was
actually tried in the latter part of August. Active work was, however, deferred
until the latter part of December, and was done chiefly in January and February of
1899. While the method and results will be fully described in the forthcoming
publication, a brief statement will be appropriate here.

The radiations of the sun were used as the source of energy up to a wave-length
of 44, but from this point to 6.5 (where the research was stopped partly because
the grating used was no longer applicable, and partly because further progress was of
no particular interest) the radiations of an iron gauze mantle heated in a Kitson
lamp! were employed. The radiations, from whichever source, fell first upon a slit
10 centimeters high, then upon a concave diffraction grating, and then upon the slit
of the spectro-bolometer, which remained practically as used in taking solar bolo-
graphs. The grating apparatus being mounted according to Rowland’s well-known
device, radiations whose wave-lengths were multiples of each other fell upon the slit
of the spectro-bolometer, and passed through to have their prismatic deviations
determined. For instance, if the apparatus was adjusted so that the well-marked
line of wave-length 0.5616 in the fourth-order spectrum was found by visual obser-
vation falling at the center of the slit, then it would be certain that radiations of
the following multiples of this wave-length also fell there: 4/3, 4/2, and 4/1. The
two latter would be well within the infra-red.

Suppose, now, the driving clock of the spectro-bolographic apparatus to be started,
and a curve automatically produced just as a bolograph would be. The form of this
curve would bea straight line only broken by the minute accidental deflections of
the galvanometer, except where the narrow bands of radiation at the above wave-
lengths caused narrow, steep-sided elevations. If we suppose, still further, that either
before or after this curve was made the direct sunlight was reflected upon the slit of
the spectro-bolometer for several minutes, then a well-known portion of the solar
spectrum energy curve would appear in its proper relative position on the same plate,
and the positions of all the sharp elevations corresponding to known wave-lengths
could readily be measured on the comparator with reference to determined solar
absorption lines of the short bolographs. Thus the wave-lengths at as many points
as desired could be determined without any circle readings whatever.

Practically, this process (somewhat altered in details) was gone through with for
38 positions between wave lengths 0.76 and 6.5/4; and not only once, but several
tumes, with all the care for accuracy which could be taken. As a result, it may be
said that the wave lengths of the absorption lines in the infra-red solar spectrum
‘discovered at this observatory can be told with an accuracy of about 3 parts in
10,000, while previous to this determination 1 part in 100 would have been all that
could be claimed.

'This lamp, which burns vaporized petroleum oil, was very kindly placed by the
makers at the disposal of the Institution for the purpose.
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
(2) Observations on miscellaneous subjects.—Distribution of energy from terrestrial sources.

A number of energy curves, some of which are here given, were taken, in which the
Kitson lamp, provided with mantles of various kinds, was the source. Among the
maniles tried were the ordinary Welsbach (which consists of impure thorium oxide)
and others composed of pure thorium oxide, iron oxide, uranium oxide, ete.! The
distribution of energy between different wave lengths with these sources, so different
in illuminating power, is much less diversified than would be supposed, and goes
strongly to show the wastefulness even of the Welsbach light as a source of illumina-
tion. For the invisible infra-red in all cases includes by far the major portion of the
energy, and not the visible spectrum, as is the case with the sun and still more with
phosphorescent substances. However, by the employment of a second spectroscope,
or ‘‘ sifting train,’’ to exclude the stray infra-red radiations, we were able to determine
the distribution of the relatively small amount of energy in the visible spectra of
the various sources, and to show how far the ordinary Welsbach mantle outstripped
them all for light, especially in the red, orange, and yellow.

_ In these experiments a very considerable number (at least fifty) of absorption
bands were discovered at wave lengths beyond 4, which were most probably due
to the gases given off by the lamp in burning, and perhaps solely to carbon dioxide.

Absorption in the solar spectrum.—All the bolographic records, extending back to
1893, were carefully examined with regard to the changes in absorption noted in last
year’s report, and such changes were found to be more extensive and frequent than
had been supposed. The great decreases in absorption at Y and J were found to
occur every spring, and to a lesser extent every fall; but were occasionally found in
the winter also, but never in the summer. Such changes were found sometimes to
go through their whole cycle in a week, and the absorption here is found to largely
increase with declining sun.

The effect of water to absorb in this region was studied. Narrow cells of glass,
whose absorption was known, were filled with water and placed in the path of the
beam in taking bolographs of the solar spectrum. It was thus shown that ‘‘liquid”’
water absorbs most strongly at the particular regions where these annual variations
are noticed. A fraction of a millimeter thickness of water was found enough to
produce a great effect beyond the wave length 1.2“, and 2 millimeters thickness pro-
duced almost complete absorption of the solar rays beyond 1.24.

Constants of prisms.—In the course of the reduction of measures on bolographs the
exact index of refraction at the A line for the salt and fluorite prisms was required.
Several measurements of these quantities made at different times failing of satisfac-
tory agreement, several interesting things came out in finding the sources of error.

Rock salt prisms have not constant angles. It was shown that with a rising
temperature the faces of the prism, if at first flat, became convex, and all three
angles of the prism increase, unless they be determined at the centers of the faces.
After the discovery of the very appreciable value of this change with our great
prisms, it was at once found that their faces, when polished flat, are considerably
concave after coming to their constant temperature. This is because of the surface
heating caused by the friction of the polisher. It is now the practice to leave the
faces polished very slightly convex, to allow for this temperature change.

Effect of this on the accuracy of bolographs and on the determination of prism
angles. After a very considerable amount of analytical investigation it was shown
that such concavity of prism faces as was present when the bolographs were taken
need introduce no error of appreciable magnitude in the relative deviations of the
bolographs, provided the angle of the prism was determined to within 10 seconds of

are at a point a little nearer the back of the prism than the ceater of the faces, and
this was done in practice. However, in determining absolute quantities like the
index of refraction at A, it was found necessary to be far more particular.
Measurement of refractive indices at A.—Diaphragms just wide enough for visual

resolution of A were placed symmetrically on the faces, and the prism was so placed
on the prism table that exactly the same beam of light entered the diaphragm in one
position of the prism as in the other, in measuring both the angle and the minimum
deviation. In this way very excellent accord was obtained between several series of
measures, and the following constants were fixed for the refractive indices of rock
salt and fluorite in air at 20° C. and 760 mm. pressure. Average wave length of
radiations, 0.7604 se.

For rock salt n = 1.536818 + .000009

For fluorite = = 1.481020 + .000006

Do all rock-salt prisms have the same dispersion? We were led to believe the affirma-
tive upon this very important question by recorded results from many prisms, but
we have conclusive evidence in the following comparison of the dispersion of three
salt prisms, two from Russian and one from Bavarian salt, between wave lengths 0.4
and 4.0. The results indicated the affirmative, for the differences in the refractive
indices in all this range never exceeded the probable experimental error of determi-
nation. To be more precise, the results at A were as follows:

Prism Re B. n = 1.536818 + .000009
Prism R. B. Il. n= 1.536844 + .000006
Prism 8. P. L. T. 7» = 1.536812 + .000005

At other points the differences were of the same order of magnitude.

It follows then, as you have anticipated and elsewhere pointed out, that this most
interesting crystal, whose optical application from the time of Melloni to the com-
mencement of these observations has been chiefly qualitative as a transmitter of
special radiations, can now be used quantitatively with practical convenience in the
form of a 60° prism, as a standard of refraction to which all wave lengths may be
referred with the same order of precision as to the grating.

The temperature coefficient of refractive indices for rock-salt prisms.—Bolographs were
taken at low and high constant temperatures, and from these in connection with former
results the temperature coefficient for the whole range of radiations covered by our
bolographs was accurately determined.

Comparison of the efficiency of the bolometer and thermopile.—It will be recalled that
the thermopile has recently been made far more delicate and efficient by improve-
ments of Rubens, so that with him and with some others it has displaced the bolo-
meter for radiation work. A comparison made here between one of these instru-
ments and our bolometer, No. 20, shows the latter, though of only one-fifteenth the
surface, to give twice the deflection at the galvanometer when substituted for the
thermopile. The galvanometer was besides more free from ‘drift’? and ‘‘ wiggle”
with the bolometer, and there was no ‘‘creep’’ to the deflection with it, while such
‘““creep’’ lasted 5 or 10 seconds with the thermopile. The bolometer has besides the
advantage that it can be made more strictly linear and far narrower than the thermo-
pile, and is capable of exact setting in the spectrum. To offset these advantages, the
thermopile requires no battery or balancing coils, and costs but about one-thirtieth as
much as the bolonieter with its necessary accessories. Nevertheless, to make it equal
to the bolometer as regards ‘‘ wiggle’’ and ‘‘drift’’ and capacity for accurate setting
it would require a mounting at least a fourth as costly as the bolometer and its acces-
sories. On the whole the bolometer has the advantage, except in cost.
72 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

B.—PREPARATION FOR PUBLICATION.

Owing to the great addition in new matter, and to recent alterations in apparatus
and methods, much new copy had to be added to the manuscript previously prepared,
and all had to be revised.

Nearly 60,000 comparator measurements of various kinds were reduced through
various stages. Several large scale plots were made and used in connection with the
comparison of the dispersion of rock salt and fluorite, and with the determination of
wave lengths in the rock salt, fluorite, and glass prismatic spectra.

Illustrations consisting of bolographs, photographs, plots, and spectrum maps have
been gotten ready for reproduction, and the whole has been sent to the engraver.

C.—MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.

Apparalus.— Among the several pieces of new apparatus which have been procured
are two deserving of special attention. These are the new rock-salt prism ‘‘R B. LD’
and the new bolometer case.

The salt for this prism was obtained from the salt mines of Russia through the
efforts and courtesies of officers of both the Russian and United States Governments.
The prism was cut and polished by Brashear, and in its final form can not but be a
source of great gratification, for with the exception of a few tiny bubbles within, it is
clear of flaw or defect of any kind, and forms a great 60° prism, 15 centimeters on the
edge and 17.5 centimeters high, as clear and perfect as the mind could conceive.

The new bolometer case, in which every accessory of the bolometer but the battery
and galvanometer is combined in very moderate compass, required considerable shop-
work after its arrival, owing to the carelessness of the maker, but is now in a most
satisfactory condition and is a great advance on any previous form.

Proposed new galvanometer.—Despite the success of efforts to increase the sensitive-
ness of the bolometric apparatus, there still remains much to be desired, for we see
and photograph objects by radiations so feeble as to be still utterly beyond the
powers of even our latest heat-measuring apparatus. Experience suggests the possi-
bility that still further advances may be made by increasing the available sensitive-
ness of the bolometric apparatus. This will be understood when it is said that if our
present galvanometer were absolutely free from magnetic and mechanical disturb-
ances it could easily be made to indicate electric currents six hundred times as small
as could now be distinguished with certainty. Designs have been prepared and are
already nearly executed whereby this great improvement to the galvanometer is
hoped to be realized.

Renovation of apparatus.—The siderostat and other apparatus were thoroughly over-
hauled and renovated late in the year 1898.

The new building.—Great want of room has been felt at the Observatory, owing to
the introduction of constant-temperature chambers, cooling apparatus, and other
bulky impedimenta. The new building of one story and basement is designed to be
used for miscellaneous measurements before crowded out or done with great diffi-
culty for lack of room. A very stable pier is one of the features of this building.

Meeting of committee of astronomers and physicists—Much pleasure was felt in extend-
ing the use of the new library and office room to a committee which drafted the
constitution of the American Astronomical and Astrophysical Society, February 8,
1899. ;

Personnel.—No changes have occurred in the permanent Observatory staff. Mr.
C. E. Mendenhall closed his temporary connection with it September 1, 1899.

CONCLUSION.

In conclusion it may be said that the researches of the present year have well fin-
ished our investigation of the infra-red solar spectrum by the accurate determination

~
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. io

of the wave lengths involved. While our knowledge of the infra-red still remains
less complete than that of the visible spectrum, both in the number of absorption
lines mapped and in the accuracy of determination of their wave lengths, yet the
difference in the methods of observation must be recalled. On the one hand are the
most powerful gratings with all the advantages of direct photography, while on the
other is only a simple prism, in whose dark spectrum we grope for cold lines and
measure their wave lengths indirectly. The results of the latter process are 750 lines
determined in wave lengths to an accuracy of 3 parts in 10,000, and besides—what
photography does not give—an exact knowledge of the distribution of the sun’s
energy.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1899.

Sir: I have the honor to present herewith the report upon the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899.

The following statement shows the number of volumes, parts of volumes, pam-
phlets, and charts received between July 1, 1898, and June 30, 1899:

The accession numbers run from 390,914 to 413,772 in the record book.

The additions to the libraries of the Secretary, the office, and the Astrophysical
Observatory number 318 volumes and pamphlets and 1,985 parts of volumes, mak-
ing a total of 2,303 and a grand total of 36,663 accessions for the year.

In accordance with the general plan for the increase of the library 845 letters were
written for new exchanges and for completing series already in the library, as a
result 241 new periodicals and serials were added to the list and 408 defective series
were either completed or added to as far as the publishers could supply the missing
parts.

Since the removal of the Library of Congress to its new building, and the better
facilities therein for the care of books, it has been found possible to send a much
greater portion of the Smithsonian library to the Library of Congress than hereto-
fore, and this proportion may be expected to be increased in the future.

A special room has been set apart in the Institution for assembling prints and books
relating to the fine arts. It is hoped that this room will be suitably fitted up during
the coming year.

An account of the operations of the Museum library is presented in connection
with the reports of the Museum. This collection is constantly growing in value, but
in both buildings the space as well as the number of assistants are entirely inadequate
to meet the growth of recent years. ;

The small circulating library established for the employees of the Institution
has been catalogued and arranged and has been a source of much pleasure and
instruction.

I attended the second conference on an international catalogue of scientific litera-
ture held in London October 11-13, 1898, as the representative of the United States
Government.

Very respectfully,
: Cyrus ADLER, Librarian.
Mr. S. P. Laneciry,

APPENDIX VII.
REPORT OF THE EDITOR.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the publications of the
Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 1899:

The Institution proper publishes three series of works: The Contributions to
Knowledge, in quarto, and the Miscellaneous Collections and Annual Report, in
octavo. The Contributions and Collections are printed in limited editions, at the
expense of the Smithsonian fund, for distribution to the principal libraries and
learned institutions of the world, while the Report is printed by order of Congress
in large editions for general distribution. So great is the demand for the Report,
however, that it is impracticable to have an individual list of recipients, but the
volume is distributed to libraries in principal centers, and so widely scattered that
the books may be available to the greatest number of persons.

Under the general direction of the Institution are also published the Proceedings
and Bulletin of the National Museum, the Museum volume of the Smithsonian
Report, and the Annual Report and Bulletin of the Bureau of American Ethnology;
and through the Secretary of the Institution there are transmitted to Congress the
Annual Report of the American Historical Association and the Report of the
National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The Institution
has, however, no copies of either of the last two documents at its disposal, except
that a small number of the historical reports are available for exchange with his-
torical societies at home and abroad.

I. CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.
No memoir of the Contributions was completed during the year.
Il. MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

Three works in the series of collections were issued, entitled First Supplement
of Bibliography of Chemistry, Index to Literature of Thallium, and Index to Litera-
ture of Zirconium.

1170. A Select Bibliography of Chemistry, 1892-1897. By H. Carrington Bolton.
First Supplement. Octavo. 1x, 489 pages.

In the preface the author describes this work as follows:

The Select Bibliography of Chemistry, 1492-1892, was published in 1893; this
First Supplement includes works omitted in that volume and brings the literature
of chemistry down to the close of the year 1897. In the following pages the lines of
the original work have been followed, the term chemistry being taken in its fullest
significance, the range of topics will be seen in the Subject-Index and their distribu-
tion in the table on page vii. This supplement does not embrace academic disserta-
tions, a catalogue of which is nearly ready for the press.

As in the first volume, the titles are grouped in sections with a view to facilitating
reference: I, Bibliography; II, Dictionaries; III, History; IV, Biography; V,
Chemistry, Pure and Applied; VII, Periodicals. Section VI, Alchemy, has been
dropped. The scope of each section is explained in the first volume, and it need
only be here pointed out that in each (excepting those of biography and periodicals)
the titles are arranged alphabetically by authors, translations of each work following
the original in the alphabetical order of the English names of the languages. The

75
(6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

order is the same as in the table on page vii. In the Section of Biography the titles
are placed under the names of the persons described, with cross references from the
authors.

1171. Index to the Literature of Thallium, 1861-1896, by Martha Doan. Octavo
pamphlet of 26 pages. ;

Baskerville. Octayo pamphlet of 29 pages.

Ill. SMITHSONIAN ANNUAL REPORTS.

The Smithsonian Reports for 1896 and 1897, except the 1897 Museum yolume, were
distributed during this fiscal year, their completion having been unavoidably delayed.
The separate papers of the Smithsonian volume of the 1896 report were enumerated
in detail in the last report of the editor, as also were the general contents of the 1897
volume. Neither the 1898 Smithsonian volume nor the 1897 and 1898 Museum
volumes of the report had been completed at the close of the year.

REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITU-
TION AND NATIONAL MUSEUM, TRANS-MISSISSIPPI AND INTERNA-
TIONAL EXPOSITION, OMAHA, NEBRASKA, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the Trans-Mississippi and
International Exposition, held at Omaha, Nebr., from June 1 to October 31, 1898:

The act of Congress approved June 10, 1896, authorizing a display of the resources
of the Government at the exposition, provided for participation by the Smithsonian
Institution, and the sum of $24,088.81 was allotted by the Government board of
management for the expenees involved in the preparation, transportation, and
maintenance of the exhibit.

All dependencies of the Institution were represented by displays at the exposition,

The space assigned to the Institution was located in the central part of the Goy-
ernment building, and comprised about 4,000 square feet. The frontage on the main
aisle was about 84 feet and the depth 42 feet. The exhibit was planned to give a
general idea of the scope and character of the Institution and its several bureaus.
For obvious reasons, the activities of the National Museum were more thoroughly
illustrated than those of other bureaus.

Though the exhibits selected were as far as possible of interest intrinsically, the
main object was to illustrate methods of work rather than to display exhaustive col-
lections, which, indeed, would have been impossible in view of the limited space
available. The methods employed by the Institution in the classification, mount-
ing, and labeling, and general installation of objects of diverse kinds were fully
shown. The cases—with the exception of those specially built for the exhibit of the
Smithsonian Institution proper, and the stationary wall cases—were of uniform
dimensions (units), and finished in every instance in a substantial and attractive
style. A harmonious color scheme was maintained throughout the entire display.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION PROPER.

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution proper, occupying a quadrant under
the dome of the building, was as follows:

A complete set of the publications of the Institution and its bureaus. (In a special
upright case. )

A cast of the bronze tablet recently placed on the tomb of Smithson in Genoa,
Italy. (In front of the same case. )

Personal relics of Smithson: Photographic copies of the title pages of his more
important papers; the seal of the Institution. (In table cases. )

A picture of the Smithsonian building. (In a table case. )

Framed portraits of the Secretaries of the Smithsonian Institution: ae Henry
(1846-1878) , Spencer Fullerton Baird (1878-1887), Samuel Pierpont Langley (elected
1887).

Copies of the history of the first half century of the Smithsonian Institution in dif-
ferent bindings; title page and illustrations for the same. (In a table case. )

Objects and papers relating to the Hodgkins fund: Copies of publications; Hodg-
kins medals in silver and bronze (portrait of Thomas G. Hodgkins, who bequeathed
the fund to the Smithsonian Institution in 1891 for use in promoting researches on
atmospheric air). (In a table case. )

Two large photographs of the erodrome of Professor Langley.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution proper was selected, under the direc-
tion of the Secretary, by Assistant Secretary Richard Rathbun.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

This Bureau exhibited three large panels of illustrations selected from its annual
reports, showing the scope of the work. A set of the Bureau’s reports was included
in the case containing the publications of the Smithsonian Institution and its
dependencies.

The exhibit was assembled by Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge, under the
supervision of Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau.

At the Indian congress held in conjunction with the exposition a miniature Kiowa
Indian camping circle was exhibited by the Bureau, under the charge of Mr. James
Mooney, who collected the material for the same.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK,

The exhibit of the National Zoological Park consisted of a model of the park,
showing its topography, wooded areas, animal houses, and inclosures; water-color
and pen-and-ink sketches of the animal houses and of picturesque points in the
park, and transparencies from photographs of characteristic features of the park.
This exhibit was assembled by Dr. Frank Baker, superintendent of the park.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

This Bureau exhibited a map showing the distribution of its correspondents
throughout the world, and a large diagram indicating the growth of the service by
decades since the year 1850.

The exhibit was prepared by Mr. W. I. Adams, chief clerk of the Bureau, under
the direction of the assistant secretary of the Institution.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The exhibit of the Astrophysical Observatory was selected and prepared under the
direction of the Secretary of the Institution. The following objects were included:

Photographs of the exterior and interior of the Observatory building; the bolom-
eter, or electric thermometer, an instrument of extreme delicacy, the invention of
Professor Langley; photographs of other instruments in the Observatory, such as the
siderostat, galvanometer and spectrometer; and enlarged photographs of the spectrum
of the sun.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

In the organization of the exhibit of the National Museum two principal objects
were kept in view: First, to indicate the comprehensiveness of the scope of the
Museum; second, to represent the manner in which series of objects are arranged,
labeled, and displayed in the Museum halls at Washington.

In carrying out the first idea only an outline could be presented owing to lack of
space. As regards the second, it should be remarked that the cases, fittings, and
labels employed were for the most part from the regular stock of the Museum and
were of exactly the same style as those used in Washington. A few new methods
regarded as improvements were introduced.

The Museum is divided into three departments, each of which is again subdivided
into divisions and sections. The exhibits are here given by departments.

DepartMENr or ANTHROPOLOGY.—The exhibit of this department of the Museum
was planned and prepared by Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator, assisted by the
scientific staff.

The exhibit occupied nineteen cases nearest the rotunda of the Government build-
ing. The principal functions of this department of the Museum are to preserve and
84 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

study the varied phenomena of human culture and especially to present to the public
by means of exhibits the leading facts of human effort and progress.

Much attention was given to the native American peoples and culture, and to the
history of the United States, but a symmetrical presentation of race history calls for
illustrations from the whole field of anthropology, and all times and all races were
made to contribute.

The group of exhibits presented at the exposition was intended to illustrate the
achievements of the race along a few of the more important lines of activity. Each
series of objects epitomized the subject treated and presented the leading steps of
progress in the simplest possible manner.

The subjects illustrated were as follows:

Fire making and illumination.—The discovery of the use of fire and the making of
fire by artificial means was illustrated by a single series of objects. The story began
with the fire of voleanoes and lightning, followed by the kindling and keeping of
fire, and closed with the utilization of the electric spark. Illumination was repre-
sented by two series: (1) The torch, and (2) the lamp.

Tools of general use.—The tools and utensils employed by men in the various arts
were arranged in series, beginning with the simplest and ending with the highest
forms. Tools of general use were illustrated in eight series, as follows: The ham-
mer, the ax (American), the ax (European), the adz, the knife, the saw, the drill,
the scraper.

Weapons.—Weapons have performed an important part in the history of man
and culture, and the steps that lead up from the stone and club held in the hand
to the steel sword and the machine gun were illustrated by two series of objects:
(1) Weapons for use in the hand—piercing and slashing weapons; (2) projectile
weapons—the bow and arrow, the pistol and the gun. é

Exploitative arts.—Of the various exploitative or material-acquiring activities so
necessary to the sustenance of the race, only one group—the art of fishing—was
illustrated. The four series shown were as follows: (1) the dart, (2) the toggle, (3)
the hook, (4) the sinker.

Domestic arts.—The domestic arts were represented by one series illustrating the —
development of cooking arts, and by three series showing the table utensils employed —
in eating and drinking—the cup, the spoon, the knife, and fork. The developiieaa
of the tobacco pipe was shown in this connection. x

The great group of elaborative activities concerned in manufacture, was illustrated f
by three exhibits: the ceramic art, the textile art, and sculpture.

Ceramic art.—Ceramics included four series: (1) implements and devices employed
in manufacture: (2) the vase, (3) glass, (4) enamel.

Textile art.—Weaving had three series: (1) the spindle, (2) the shuttle, (3) the
loom.

Sculpture, stone-shaping.—Sculpture was represented by four series: (1) prehistoric
stone-shaping (Europe), (2) aboriginal American sculpture, (3) sculpture of civil-
ized nations, (4) implements employed in stone-shaping. j

The book.—A small series was devoted to the history of the book, and the method —
of assembling the s ts or writing sheets being the feature F
considered. :

Musical instruments.—Four series were devoted to the development. of as many —
varieties of musical instruments: (1) Wind instruments, (2) reed instruments, (3)
stringed instruments, (4) percussion instruments.

Photography.—Photography was represented by three interesting series, showing
steps of progress: (1) The camera, (2) the lens, (3) the picture. %

Transportation.—The history of water transportation was epitomized in four of its
leading features: (1) The development of the hull, (2) methods of hand propulsion,
(3) the wheel, (4) the screw propeller.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. . 85

The subject of land transportation was partially shown in three series: (1) The
burden bearer and the sliding and the rolling load, (2) the wheeled vehicle, (3) the
steam locomotive.

Electricity.— Electrical inventions, representing one of the youngest and most mar-
velous branches of activity, were shown in three series: (1) experimental apparatus,
(2) transmitting apparatus, (3) recording apparatus.

Groups of figures illustrating practice of primitive arts.—Associated with the develop-
ment of exhibits were a number of life-sized figures, modeled in plaster and appro-
priately costumed, intended to illustrate the practice of the arts in their primitive
stages. They give a vivid impression of primitive processes as contrasted with the
methods and machinery of advanced civilization. The subjects presented were as
follows:

_ The driller.—An Eskimo man in reindeer-skin costume using a bow drill for boring
ivory.

The flint flaker.—A Powhatan Indian roughing out stone implements.

The hominy huller.—A southern Indian woman pounding corn in a wooden mor-
tar. Figure in plaster with costume restored from drawings made in Colonial times.

The skin dresser.—Sioux woman using a scraping or graining tool.

The potter.—Papago Indian woman modeling an earthen vessel, simple process.

The metal worker.—A Navaho Indian making silver ornaments; process probably,
in part at least, introduced by whites.

The belt weaver.—A Zuni girl with primitive loom weaving a belt.

DEPARTMENT OF BroLtoGcy.—The exhibit of this department of the Museum was
planned and prepared by Dr. F. W. True, head curator, assisted by the scientific staff.

The department of biology covers the entire field of zoology and botany. In
selecting a topic for illustration in the small space available, two ideas were kept in
view: First, to present a series of objects significant in itself and at the same time
likely to be of especial interest to visitors to the exposition; and, second, to have this
series sufficiently diversified in character to show the various methods employed in
the Department.

The exhibit comprises the characteristic animals of the marine and fresh waters of
North America, from the lowest to the highest forms, and the principal types of
seaweeds.

Lower invertebrates.

Three cases were devoted to the lower invertebrates, such as
crustaceans, worms, star-fishes, and other echinoderms, jelly-fish, corals, and other
coelenterates, and foraminifera, and other protozoans. These were arranged in
zoological order, from the lower to the higher forms. The corals and other low forms
were in a special case near the side entrance.

Mollusks.—A floor case in the regular series was devoted to typical forms of North
American shells, chiefly marine.

Insects.—Aquatic and semiaquatic insects occupied the adjoining wall.

Fishes.—A series of painted casts representing the principal families of North
American fishes occupied one-half of a long wall-case. About seventy families in all
were represented. Included with the casts was a small series of skeletons of the
lowest forms of fishes.

Reptiles and batrachians.—The principal types of North American aquatic reptiles
and batrachians, such as the turtles, terrapin, water snakes, frogs, salamanders, etc.,
were exhibited in the wall-case. Casts of the larger sea turtles were exhibited on
the wall directly above the case. These were the leatherback turtle, the green
turtle, and the loggerhead.

Birds.—A large series included the principal aquatic birds of North America.
They were arranged in zoological order as nearly as circumstances permitted in the
wall-case.

Mammals.—The following porpoises were represented by full-sized casts from life.
The harbor porpoise (Phocaena phocaena), the black-fish (Globicephalus melas), the
grampus (Grampus griseus), and the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis).
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Seaweeds.—Aquatic plants were represented by seaweeds, a full series of the prin-
cipal American types of which were exhibited in two cases on the central aisle.

DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY.—The exhibit of this department was planned and
arranged by Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator, assisted by the scientific staff.

The exhibit was planned and arranged to convey an idea to the public of the
scope of the department. To this end the space was divided in equal portions
between the divisions of systematic geology, mineralogy, paleontology, and paleo-
botany.

Division of systematic and applied geology.—In this division were two cases filled
with examples of cave deposits and concretionary structures, and five cases contain-
ing minerals, rocks, and ores of economic value, including a characteristic series of
the iron ores of the United States, and a systematic series of ores of the minor metals,
including those of mercury, nickel, and cobalt, antimony, bismuth, and others of the
rarer metals. Also a collection of nonmetallic minerals of economic importance,
including various salts used in chemical manufacture, abrasives, fictile materials,
asbestus, mica, mineral pigments, graphite, coals, and other natural hydrocarbon
compounds.

Division of mineralogy.—The exhibit of this division treated of the systematic
arrangement and chemical classification of the several representatives of the mineral
kingdom.

The series was grouped under two classes—elements and compounds of elements.
The compounds of the elements were further divided in accordance with chemical
laws and grouped under certain prominent types according to, and which take their
names from, their more negative constituents, as follows: Compounds of the halogens,
fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and iodides; compounds of sulphur, selenium, and
tellurium; also arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, including sulphides, selenides, and
tellurides; arsenides, antimonides, and bismuthides, sulpharsenides, and sulphanti-
monides; also sulphosalts, oxygen compounds, including oxides and the oxygen salts,
borates, aluminates, chromites ferrites, manganites, selenites and tellurites, carbonates
and tantalates, nitrates, vanadates, phosphates, arsenates, selenates and tellurates,
chromates; molybates, tungstates, iodates, and uranadates. Each of these groups was
preceded by a descriptive label giving the name of the type and a brief description
of its more prominent character. Following the*descriptive label, arranged in order
from left to right, were several representatives of the type selected, so far as possible,
to illustrate the character of the group as a whole.

Section of invertebrate fossils. —In one case was shown the largest American ammonites,
a group of chambered shells related to the living Pearly Nautilus. Another case was
devoted to crinoids, a group of animals related to the starfishes. The following two

cases were occupied by trilobites, crustaceous animals which became extinct shortly —

after the great coal series of the Mississippi Valley had been formed. Still another
case was devoted to lampshells, or brachiopods. The interior structure of some of

skeleton for the support of the arms.

The crinoids, trilobites, and brachiopods were arranged in sytematic order, and
the series of specimens representing each general group was preceded by a descrip-
tive label. All these fossils were mounted on uniform buff-colored encaustic floor
tiles, a method of installation recently introduced into the National Museum.

Section of vertebrate fossils.—In this section was shown a series of specimens of
some of the earlier forms of fishes, and a series of teeth and spines of Carboniferous
sharks. These two series were accompanied by illustrations showing the forms of
fishes when restored, and the position of the spines and their relations to the fins.
Specimens of the fishes from the Eocene formation of Green River and of Mosasaur
reptiles from the chalk formation of western Kansas were also exhibited.

SMUETHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1899.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GennRAL. APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by col-
laborators of the Institution, and memoirs of a general character or
on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous corre-
spondents of the Institution.

It has heena prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to allattracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,

‘meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1899.

cok WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT: Its. INFLUENCE ON
MODERN PHYSICS.*

By A. Cornu.’

Our era is distinguished from preceding ages by wonderful utiliza-
tion of natural forces; man, that weak and defenseless being, has been
enabled by his genius to acquire an extraordinary power, and to bend
to his use those subtle yet dreadful agents whose very existence was
unknown to our ancestors. This marvelous increase of his material
power in modern times is due only to the patient and profound study
of natural phenomena, to the exact knowledge of the laws that gov
erned them, and to the skillful combining of their effects. But what

1Printed in Nature July 27, 1899, with the following notes: ‘‘We are glad to be
able to publish this week a translation of the Rede lecture delivered at Cambridge by
Prof. Alfred Cornu, professor of experimental physics in the Ecole polytechnique,
Paris, and a foreign member of the Royal Society, on the occasion of the recent cele-
bration of the jubilee of Sir George Stokes as Lucasian professor of mathematical
physics. Professor Cornu delivered the lecture in French, and we are indebted to
him for the translation of his brilliant discourse.”’

* Besides the interest presented by a glance on the progress and the influence of
optical science, this lecture offers the conclusions of a careful study on Newton’s
treatise of optics. It will be seen that the thought of the great physicist has been
singularly altered by a sort of legendary interpretation developed in the elementary
treatises where the emission-theory is expounded. In order to make the theory of
fits clearer, the commentators have imagined to materialize the luminous molecule
under the form of a rotating arrow offering now its head, now its side. This mode of
exposition has contributed to lead to the belief that the whole emission-theory was
comprehended in this rather childish image.

Nowhere in his treatise does Newton givea mechanical illustration of the luminous
molecule: he confines himself to the description of facts, and sums them up in an
empirical statement without any hypothetical explanation. Moreover, he denies the
opinion that he raises any theory, though he holds occasionally as very probable the
intervention of the waves excited in the ether.

So that the general impression resulting from the reading of the treatise, and
above all of the ‘‘queries’’ in the third book, is the following: Newton, far from
being the adversary of the Cartesian system, as he is commonly represented, looks,
on the contrary, very favorably at the principles of this system. Struck by the
resources which the undulatory hypothesis would offer for the explanation of the
luminous phenomena, he would have adopted it, if the grave objection concerning
the rectilinear propagation of light (only recently solved by Fresnel) had not pre-
vented him,

is peculiarly instructive is the disproportion between the primitive
phenomenon and the greatness of the effects which industry has drawn
from it. Thus, those formidable engines, based on electricity or steam,
grew neither from lightning nor the voleano; they had their birth from
scarcely perceptible phenomena which would have remained forever
hidden from the vulgar eye, but that penetrating observers were able
to recognize and appreciate. This humble origin of most of the great
discoveries which are to-day a benetit to the whole human race, shows
us plainly that the scientific spirit is at present the mainspring of the
life of nations, and that it is in the onward march of pure science that
we are to look for the secret of the growing power of the modern
world. Whence a series of questions which demand more and more
the attention of all. How did this taste toward the study of natural
philosophy, so dear to the ancient philosophers, abandoned for cen-
turies, again revive and grow? What are the phases of its advance?
How appeared the new notions which have so deeply modified our
ideas on the mechanism of nature’s forces? What paths, rich in dis-
coveries, lead us gradually unawares to those admirable generalizations
in accordance with the vast plan forseen by the founders of modern
physics? These are the questions which as a physicist I intend to
inquire into before you. The subject is rather abstract, I might say
severe. But no other has seemed more worthy of your attention
during the féte which the University of Cambridge celebrates to-day
in honor of the Lucasian Professorship Jubilee of Sir Geo. Gabriel
Stokes, who in his fine career has laid a master hand on the very prob-
lems which seemed to me the most conducive to the progress of natural
philosophy. The subject is all the more fitted here, as in citing the
names of those great minds to whom modern science is most indebted,
we found amongst those who most honored the University of Cam-
bridge—its professors and fellows—Sir Isaac Newton, Thomas Young,
George Green, Sir George Airy, Lord Kelvin, Clerk Maxwell, Lord
Rayleigh, and the memory of that glory which links to-day back
through the centuries would add luster to the present ceremony.

Let us then, in a rapid glance of the scientific revival, point out the
secret but mighty influence which has been the directing force of mod-
ern physics. Iam inclined to attribute to the study of light, and to the
attraction it has for the highest minds, one of the most effective causes
of the return of ideas toward natural philosophy, and consider optics
as having exercised on the advance of science an influence it would be
difficult to exaggerate. This influence, already clear at the dawn of
the experimental philosophy under Galileo, grew so rapidly that
to-day it is easy to foresee a vast synthesis of natural forces founded
on the principles of the wave theory of light. This influence is easy
to understand if we reflect that light is the way by which knowledge
of the exterior world reaches our intelligence. It is, in fact, to sight

ew ee eer

that we owe the quickest and most perfect notions of the objects
around us: our other senses, hearing, feeling, also bring their share
of learning, but sight alone affords us abundant means of simultaneous
information such as no other sense can. It is, therefore, not surpris-
ing that light, this lasting link between us and the outward world,
should intervene with the varied sources of its inner constitution to
render more precise the observation of natural phenomena. Thus
each discovery concerning new properties of light has had an imme-
diate effect on the other branches of human knowledge, and has indeed
determined the birth of new sciences by affording new means of inves-
tigation of unexpected power and delicacy.

Optics are really a modern science. The ancient philosophers had
no idea of the complexity of what is vulgarly called light; they con-
founded in the same name what is proper to man, and what is exterior.
They had, however, perceived one of the characteristic properties of
the link, which exists between the source of light and the eye, which
receives the impression, ‘‘ Light moves in a straight line.” Common
experience had revealed this axiom through the observation of the
shining trains that the sun throws across the skies, piercing misty
clouds, or penetrating into some dark space. Hence arises two empir-
ical notions—the definition of the ray of light, and that of the straight
line. The one became the basis of optics, the other that of geometry.

Very little remains to us of the ancient books upon optics. Yet we
are aware that they knew the reflection of the luminous rays on polished
surfaces and the geometrical explanation of the images formed by
mirrors.

We must wait many centuries until the scientific revival for a new
progress in optics (but then a very considerable one) opens the new
era; it is the invention of the telescope.

The new era begins with Galileo, Boyle, and Descartes, the founders
of experimental philosophy. All devote their life to meditations on
light, colors, and forces. Galileo lays the base of mechanics, and with
the refracting telescope that of astro-physics. Boyle improves experi-
mentation. As to Descartes, he embraces with his penetrating mind
the whole of natural philosophy; he throws away the occult causes
admitted by the scholastics, and proclaims as a principle that all phe-
nomena are governed by the laws of mechanics. In his system of the
universe, light plays a prominent part:' it is produced by the waves
excited in the subtle matter which, according to his view, pervades
space. This subtle matter (which represents what we call to-day the
ether) is considered by him as formed of particles in immediate con-
tact; it constitutes thus atthe same time the vehicle of the forces exist-
ing between the material bodies which are plunged in it. We recognize
the famous ‘*yortices of Descartes,” sometimes admired, sometimes

96 THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT.

baffled during the last centuries, but to which skillful contemporaneous
physicists have rendered the importance they deserve.

Whatever may be the opinions granted to the exactness a: the
deductions of this great philosopher, we must be struck by the bold-
ness with which he proclaims the connection of the great cosmical prob-
lems and foretells the solutions which actual generations did not yet
entirely accept, but drew insensibly to.

In Descartes’s view the mechanism of light and that of gravitation
are inseparable; the seat of corresponding phenomena is this subtle
matter which pervades the universe, and their propagation is per-
formed by waves around the acting centers.

This conception of the nature of light shocked the opinions in vogue;
it raised strong opposition. Since the oldest times it was the habit to
imagine the luminous ray as the trajectory of rapid projectiles thrown
by the radiant source. Their shock on the nerves of the eye produce
vision; their resistance or changes of speed, reflection or refraction.
The Cartesian theorv had, however, some seductive aspects which
brought defenders. The waves excited on the surface of still water
offer so. clear an image of a propagated motion around a disturbing
center! On the other hand, do not the sonorous impressions reach
our ear by waves? Our mind feels yet a real satisfaction in thinking
that our most sharp and delicate organs are both impressed by a
mechanism of the same nature.

Yet a serious difference arose. Sound does not necessarily travel
in straight lines as light does. It travels round any object opposed to
it, and will follow the most circuitous routes with scarcely any loss of
strength. Physicists were thus divided into two camps. In one the
partisans of emission, in the other those of the wave theory, each sys-
tem boasting itself superior, and indeed each being so in certain
respects. Other phenomena had to be examined in order to decide
between them.

The chance of discovery brought to view several phenomena which
ought to have decided in favor of wave theory, as was proved a century
later; but the simplest truth does not prevail without long endeavor.

A strange compromise was effected between the two systems, helped
on by a name great among the greatest, and for a century the theory
of emission triumphed.

The tale is a strange one. In 1661 a young scholar, full of eager-
ness and penetration, enters Trinity College, Cambridge; his name is
Isaac Newton. He has already in his village read Kepler’s Optics.
Almost immediately, and while following Barrow’s lectures upon
optics, he studies the geometry of Descartes with passionate care;
with his savings he buys a prism that he might examine the proper-
ties of color and meditate deeply on the causes of gravitation. Eight
years later his masters think him worthy to succeed Barrow in the

Lueasian professorship, and in his turn he also teaches optics. The
pupil soon becomes greater than his teacher, and he gives out this
great result: White light which seemed the type of pure light is not
homogeneous; it consists of rays of different refrangibility, and he
demonstrates it by the celebrated experiment of the solar spectrum, in
which a ray of white light is decomposed into a series of colored rays
like a rainbow; each shade of the color is simple, for the prism does not
decompose the shade. This is the origin of the spectral analysis.
This analysis of white light brought Newton to explain the colors of
the thin plates which are, for instance, observed in soap bubbles.
The fundamental experiment, that of Newton’s rings, is one of the
most instructive in optics, while the laws that govern it are of admir-
able simplicity.

The theory was expounded in a discourse addressed to the Royal
Society, with the title, ‘‘A new hypothesis concerning light and color.”

This discourse called forth from Hooke a sharp complaint. Hooke
also had already examined the color of thin plates, and endeavored to
explain them in the wave system. He had the merit, which Newton
himself readily granted, to substitute for the progressive wave of Des-
cartes a vibrating one—a new and extremely important notion. He
had even noticed the part of the two reflecting services of the thin
plate and the mutual action of the reflected waves. Consequently
Hooke should have been the very forerunner of the modern theory if
he had had, as Newton, the clear intelligence of the simple rays. But
his vague reasoning to explain the colors takes away all demonstrative

value from his theory.

Newton is very affected by this complaint of priority, and combats
the arguments of his adversary by remarking that the wave theory is
inadmissible because it does not explain the existence of the luminous
ray and of the shadows. He denies the opinion that he has raised a
theory; he certifies that he does not admit either the wave hypothesis
or the emission, but he says:

‘**He shall sometimes, to avoid circumlocution and to represent it
conveniently, speak of it asif he assumed it and propounded it to be
believed.”

And, really, in the Proposition XII (second book of his Optics)!
which constitutes what was since called the theory of fits, Newton
remains absolutely on the ground of facts. He says simply, the phe-

1Prop. XIJ.—Every ray of light in its passage through any refracting surface is
put into a certain transient constitution or state, which in the progress of the ray
returns at equal intervals, and disposes the ray at every return to be easily trans-
mitted through the next refracting surface, and between the returns to be easily
reflected by it. (Sir Isaac Newton, Opticks: or a Treatise of the Reflections, Refrac-
tions, Inflexions, and Colors of Light. London, 1718. Second edition, with addi-
tions, p. 293.)

nomena of thin plates prove that the luminous ray is put alternatively
in a certain state or fit of easy reflexion and of easy transmission. He
adds, however, that if an explanation of these alternative states is
required they can be attributed to the vibrations excited by the shock
of the corpuscles, and propagated under the form of a wave in ether.’

After all, notwithstanding his desire to remain on the firm ground
of facts, Newton can not help trying a rational explanation. He has
too carefully read the writings of Descartes not to be heartily, as
Huygens, a partisan of the universal mechanism and not to wish
secretly to find in the pure undulations the explanation of the beauti-
ful phenomena he has reduced to such simple laws. But his third
book on optics more especially proves his Cartesian aspirations, and,
above all, his perplexity. His famous Queries expose so forcibly his
argument in favor of the wave theory of light that Thomas Young will
later cite them as proof of the final conversion of Newton to the wave
theory. Newton would certainly have yielded to this secret inclination
had the inflexible logic of his mind allowed him to do so; but when
after enumerating the arguments the wave theory of light offers in
explanation of the intimate nature of light, when he arrived at the ©
last ‘‘queries” he stops, as if seized by a sudden remorse, and throws
it away. And the sole argument is that he does not see the possibility
of explaining the rectilinear transmission of light.” Viewed from this

'Sir Isaac Newton, Opticks: or a Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflexions,
and Colors of Light. London, 1718. Second edition, with additions, p. 299.

First, here is an extract from the Queries which prove the leaning of Newton’s
views toward the undulatory theory and the Cartesian ideas.

‘*Query 12: Do not the rays of light in falling upon the bottom of the eye excite
vibrations in the Tunica Retina? Which vibrations, being propagated along the
solid fibers of the optic nerves into the brain, cause the sense of seeing. * * *

‘Query 13: Do not several sorts of rays make vibrations of several bignesses,
which, according to their bignesses, excite sensations of several colors, much after
the manner that the vibrations of the air, according to their several bignesses, excite
sensation of several sounds? And particularly do not the most refrangible rays excite
the shortest vibrations for making a sensation of deep violet, the least refrangible
the largest for making a sensation of deep red, ete.2 * * *

“Query 18: * * * Isnot the heat of the warm room conveyed through the
vacuum by the vibrations of a much subtiler medium than the air, which, after the
air was drawn out remained in the vacuum [ether], and is not this medium the same
with that medium by which light is refracted and reflected, and by whose vibrations
light communicates heat to bodies, and is put into fits of easy reflection and easy
transmission? * * * And is not this medium exceedingly more rare and subtile
than the air, and exceedingly more elastic and active, and doth it not readily pervade
all bodies, and is it not (by its elastic force) expanded through all the heavens?

Newton, afterwards, considers the possible connection of this medium (ether) with
the gravitation and the transmission of the sensations and motion in living creatures
(queries 19 to 24).

The dissymmetrical properties of the two rays propagated in the Iceland spar, draw
equally his attention (query 25 to 26). ; ;

Here appears this sudden and unexpected going back, this sort of remorse from

THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT. S15,

standpoint the third book of Optics is no longer only an impartial
discussion of opposite systems; it appears as the painting of the suf-
fering of a mighty genius, worried by doubt, now led away by the
seductive suggestions of his imagination, now recalled by the impe-
rious requirements of logic. It is a drama: the everlasting struggle
between love and duty; and duty won.

Such, I take it, is the inner genesis of the theory of fits—a strange
mingling of two opposite systems. It was much admired, presented,

having too kindly expounded the resources of the Cartesian theory, based on the
plenum; he makes an apology as follows:

“Query 27: Are not all hypotheses erroneous which have hitherto been invented
for explaining the phenomena of light by new modifications of the rays? * * *

““Query 28: Are not all the hypotheses erroneous in which light is supposed to
consist in pression or motion, propagated through a fluid medium? * * * and if
it (light) consisted in pression or motion, propagated either in an instant or in time,
it would bend into shadow. For pression or motion can not be propagated ina fluid
in right lines beyond an obstacle which stops part of the motion, but will bend and
spread every way into the quiescent medium which lies beyond the obstacle. * * *
For a bell or a cannon may be heard beyond a hill which intercept the light of sound-
ing body, and sounds are propagated as readily through crooked pipes as through
straight ones. But light is never known to follow crooked passages nor to bend into
the shadow. * * *”

Stopping before this objection Newton is forced to come back to the corpuscular
theory.

“Query 29: Are not the rays of light very small bodies emitted from shining sub-
panicest * * ‘*

“Query 30: Are not gross bodies and light convertible into one another * * *?
The changing of bodies into light and light into bodies is very conformable to the
course of nature, which seems delighted with transmutations. * * *”

Logic urges him to go on with the old hypothesis of the yacuum and atoms, and
even to invoke the authority of the Greek and Pheenician philosophers in this mat-
ter (query 28, p. 343), therefore it is not surprising to see his perplexity expressed
by the following words:

‘Query 31, and the last: Have not the small particles of bodies certain powers,
virtues, or forces, by which they act at a distance, not only upon the rays of light for
reflecting, refracting, and inflecting them, but also upon one another for producing
a great part of the phenomena of nature? * * *”

But he perceives that he is going rather far and compromising himself, therefore
his secret tendency, developed in the foremost queries, reappear a little while:

«x * * How these attractions may be performed I do not here consider. What
I call attraction may be performed by impulse or by some other means unknown to
me. ee eI Be 2

Many other curious remarks could be made on the state of mind of the great
physicist, goemeter, and philosopher, which is artlessly revealed in those ‘‘ queries.”’
-The preceding short extracts are sufficient, I believe, to justify the conclusion which
I get from the study of the third book, namely, that Newton had not at all on the
mechanism of light the definite ideas which have been attributed to him as founder
of the emission theory. Really, he is hesitating between the two opposite systems,
perceiving clearly their insufficiency; and in this discussion he is endeavoring to go
away as little as possible from the facts. That is the reason for which he has stated
no dogmatic theory. It would be, therefore, unjust to make Newton responsible
for every consequence which the emission partisans have shelted under his authority.
100 THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT.

as it was, by the great mathematician, who had the glory of submit-
ting the motions of all celestial bodies to the one law of universal
gravitation.

To-day this theory is abandoned; it is condemned by the eaper/-
mentum crucis of Arago, realized by Fizeau and Foucault. One ought,
however, to acknowledge that it has constituted a real progress by the
precise and new notions which it contains. The ray of light, considered
up till then, was simply the trajectory of a particle in rectilinear
motion; the ray of light, such as Newton described it, possesses a reg-
ular periodic structure, and the period or interval of fits, characterizes
the color of the ray. This is an important result. It only requires a
more suitable interpretation to transform the luminous ray into a
vibratory wave; but we had to wait a century, and Dr. Thomas Young,
in L801, had the honor of discovering it.

Resuming the study of thin plates, Thomas Young shows that every-
thing is explained with extreme simplicity, if it be supposed that the
homogeneous luminous ray is analogous to the sonorous wave produced
by a musical sound; that the vibrations of ether ought to compose—
that is to say, to interfere—according to the expression that he pro-
poses as to their mutual actions.

Although Young had taken the clever precaution of supporting his
views by the authority of Newton,’ the hypothesis found no favor; his
principle of interference led to this singular result, that light added to
light could, in certain cases, produce darkness, a paradoxical result
contradicted by daily experience. The only verification that Young
brought forward was the existence of dark rings in Newton’s experi-
ment; darkness due, according to him, to the interference of waves
reflected on the two faces of the plate. But as the Newtonian theory
interpreted the fact in a different manner, the proof remained doubt-
ful, an experimentum crucis was wanting. Young did not have the

good success to obtain it.

The theory of waves relapsed then once more into the obscurity of
controversy, and the terrible argument of the rectilinear propagation
was raised afresh against it. The most skilled geometers of the
period—Laplace, Biot, Poisson—naturally leaned to the Newtonian
opinion; Laplace in particular, the celebrated author of the Mecanique
Celeste, had even taken the offensive. He was going to attack the
theory of waves in its most strongly fortified intrenchments, which
had been raised by the illustrious Huygens.

Huygens, indeed, in his ‘* Traité dela Lumiére,” had resolved a prob-
lem before which the theory of emission had remained mute; that is
to say, the explanation of the double refraction of Iceland spar. The
wave theory (on the contrary) reduced to the simplest geometrical

construction the path of the two rays, ordinary and extraordinary.
Experiment confirmed the results in every point. Laplace succeeded
in his turn (with the help of hypotheses of the constitution of lumi-
nous particles) to explain the path of these strange rays. The victory
of the theory of particles then appeared complete. A new phenome-
non arrived also appropriately to render it striking.

Malus discovered that a common ray of light reflected under a cer-
tain angle acquired unsymmetrical properties similar to those rays
from a crystal of Iceland spar. He explained this phenomenon by an
orientation of the luminous molecule, and, consequently, named this
light polarized light. This was a new success for emission.

The triumph was not of long duration. In 1816 a young engineer
scarcely out of the Ecole Pol teehee. Augustin Fresnel, confided
to Arago his doubts on the theory then in favor, and pointed out to
him the experiments which tended to overthrow it.

Supporting himself on the ideas of Huygens, he attacked the for-
midable question of rays and shadows, and had resolved it; all the
phenomena of diffraction were reduced to an analytical problem,
and observations verified calculation marvelously. He had, without
knowing it, rediscovered Young’s reasoning as well as the principle
of interference; but more fortunate than he, he brought the exper/-
mentum crucis—the two-mirror experiment; there, two rays, issuing
from the same source, free from any disturbance, produced when they
met, sometimes light, sometimes darkness. The illustrious Young
was the first to applaud the success of his young rival, and showed
him a kindness which never changed.

Thus, thanks to the use of the two-mirror experiment, the theory of
Dr. Young—that is to say, the complete analogy of the luminous ray
and the sound wave—is firmly established.

Moreover, Fresnel’s theory of diffraction shows the cause of their
dissimilarity; light is propagated in straight lines because the lumi-
nous waves are extremely small. On the contrary, sound is diffused
because the lengths of the sonorous waves are relatively very great.

Thus vanished the terrible objection which had so much tormented
the mind of great Newton.

But there remained still to explain another essential difference
between the luminous wave and the sonorous wave; the latter under-
goes no polarization. Why is the luminous wave polarized /

The answer to this question appeared so diflicult that Young declared
he would renounce seeking it. Fresnel worked more than five years
to discover it. The answer is as simple as unexpected. The sound wave
can not be polarized because the vibrations are longitudinal; light, on
the other hand, can be polarized because the vibrations are transv erse
that is to say, eepemnetias to the luminous ray.

Henceforth the nature of light is completely established. All the

phenomena presented as objections to the undulatory theory are
explained with marvelous facility, even down to the smallest details.

I would fain have traced by what an admirable suite of experiment
and reasoning Fresnel arrived at this discovery, one of the most
important of modern science; but time presses.

It has sufficed me to explain how very great the difficulties were
which he had to overcome in order to establish it.

I hasten to point out its consequences.

You saw, at starting, the purely physiological reasons which make
the study of light the necessary center of information gathered by
human intelligence. You judge now, by the march of this long devel-
opment of optical theories, what preoccupations it has always caused
to powerful minds interested in natural forces. Indeed, all the phe-
nomena which pass before our eyes involve a transmission to a distance
of force or movement; let the distance be infinitely great, as in celes-
tial space, or infinitely small, as in molecular intervals, the mystery is
the same. But light is the agent which brings us the movement of
luminous bodies. To fathom the mechanism of this transmission is to
fathom that of all others, and Descartes had the admirable intuition of
this when he comprehended all these problems in a single mechanical
conception. Here is the secret bond which has always attracted the
physicists and geometers toward the study of light. Looked at from
this point of view, the history of optics acquires a considerable philo-
sophical importance; it becomes the history of the successive progress
of our knowledge on the means that nature employs to transmit move-
ment and force to a distance.

The first idea which came to the mind of man (in the savage state)
to exercise his force beyond his reach is the throwing of a stone, of an
arrow, or of some projectile; this is the germ of the theory of emission.
This theory corresponds to a philosophical system which assumes an
empty space in which the projectile moves freely. At a more advanced
degree of culture, man having become a physicist, has had the more
delicate idea of the transmission of movement by waves, suggested at
first by the study of waves; afterwards by that of sound.

This second way supposes, on the other hand, that space is a plenum;
there is no longer here transport of matter; particles oscillate in the
direction of propagation, and it is by compression or rarefaction of a
continuous elastic medium that movement and force are transmitted.
Such has been the origin of the theory of luminous waves. Under this
form it could only represent a part of the phenomena. It was there-
fore insuflicient.

But geometers and physicists before Fresnel did not know of any
other undulatory mechanism in a continuous medium. :

The great discovery of Fresnel has been to reveal a third mode of

THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT. 103

transmission quite as natural as the preceding one, but which offers an
incomparable richness of resources. These are the waves of transverse
vibrations excited in an incompressible continuous medium; those
which explain all the properties of light.

In this undulatory mode the displacement of particles brings into

» play an elasticity of a special kind. This is the relative slipping of
strata concentric to the disturbance which transmits the movement
and the effort. The character of these waves is to impose on the
medium no variation of density as in the system of Descartes. The
richness of resource mentioned above depends upon the fact that the
form of the transverse vibration remains indeterminate, and thus con-
fers on waves an infinite variety of different properties.

The rectilinear, circular, and elliptical forms characterize precisely
the polarizations, so unexpected, which Fresnel discovered, and by the
aid of which he has so admirably explained the beautiful phenomena
of Arago produced by crystallized plates.

The possible existence of waves which are propagated without change
of density, has profoundly modified the mathematical theory of elas-
ticity. Geometers found again in their equations waves having trans-
verse vibrations which were unknown to them. They learned besides,
from Fresnel, the most general constitution of elastic media, of which
they had not dreamed.

It is in his admirable memoir on double refraction that this great
physicist set forth the idea that in crystals the elasticity of the ether
ought to vary with the direction, an unexpected condition and one of
extreme importance, which has transformed the fundamental bases of
molecular mechanics; the works of Cauchy and Green are the striking
proots of it. From this principle Fresnel concluded the most general
form of the surface of the luminous wave in crystals, and found (as a
particular case) the sphere and-ellipsoid that Huygens had assigned to
the Iceland spar crystal. This new, discovery éxcited universal admi-
ration among physicists and geometers. . When Arago came to expound
it before the Académie des Sciences, Laplace, who had been such a
long time hostile, declared himself convinced. Two years later Fres-
nel, unanimously elected a member of the Academy, was elected with
the same unanimity foreign member of the Royal Society of London.
Young himself transmitted to him the announcement of this distinction,
with personal testimony of his sincere admiration.

The definite foundation of the undulatory theory imposes the neces-
sity of admitting the existence of an elastic medium to transmit the
luminous movement. But does not all transmission to a distance of
movement or of force imply the same condition? To Faraday is due
the honor of having, like a true disciple of Descartes and Leibnitz,
proclaimed this principle, and of having resolutely attributed to reac-
104 THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT.

tions of surrounding media the apparent action at a distance of electrical
and magnetic systems. Faraday was recompensed for his boldness by
the discovery of induction.

And since induction acts even across a space void of ponderable
matter, one is forced to admit that the active medium is precisely that
which transmits the luminous wayes—the ether.

The transmission of a movement by an elastic medium can not be
instantaneous; if it is truly luminous ether that is the transmitting
medium, ought not the induction to be propagated with the velocity of
Juminous waves 4

The verification was difficult. Yon Helmholtz, who tried the direct
measurement of this velocity, found, as Galileo formerly, for the
velocity of light a value practically infinite.

But the attention of physicists was attracted by a singular numer-
ical coincidence. The relation between the unity of electrostatic quan-
tity to the electro-magnetic unit is represented by a number precisely
equal to the velocity of light.

The illustrious Clerk Maxwell, following the ideas of Faraday, did
not hesitate to see in the relationship the indirect measure of the
velocity of induction, and by a series of remarkable deductions he
built up this celebrated electro-magnetic theory of light, which identi-
fies in one mechanism three groups of phenomena completely distinct
in appearance—light, electricity, and magnetism.

But the abstract theories of natural phenomena are nothing without
the control of experiment.

The theory of Maxwell was submitted to proof, and the success sur-
passed all expectation. The results are too recent and too well known,
especially here, for it to be necessary to insist upon them.

A young German physicist, Henry Hertz, prematurely lost to sci-
ence, starting from the beautiful analysis of oscillatory discharges of
Von Helmholtz and Lord Kelvin, so perfectly produced electric and
electro-magnetic waves that these waves possess all the properties
of luminous waves. The only distinguishing peculiarity is that their
vibrations are less rapid than those of light.

It follows that one can reproduce with electric discharges the most
delicate experiments of modern optics—reflection, refraction, diffrac-
tion, rectilinear, circular, elliptic polarization, etc. But I must stop,
gentlemen. I feel that I have assumed too weighty a task in endeay-
oring to enumerate the whole wealth which waves of transverse vibra-
tions have to-day placed in our hands.

Isaid at the beginning that optics appeared to me to be the direct-
ing science in modern physics.

If any doubt can have arisen in your minds, I trust this impression
has been effaced to give place to a sentiment of surprise and admira-

THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT. 105

tion in seeing all that the study of light has brought of new ideas on
the mechanism of the forces of nature.

Tt has insensibly restored the Cartesian conception of a single medium
refilling space, the seat of electrical, magnetic, and luminous phe-
nomena. It allows us to foresee that this medium is the depositary of
the energy spread throughout the material world, the necessary vehicle
of every force, the origin even of universal gravitation.

Such is the work accomplished by optics. Itis perhaps the greatest
thing of the century!

The study of the properties of waves, viewed in every aspect, is
therefore, at the present moment, the most fertile study.

It is that which has been followed in the double capacity of geome-
ter and physicist by Sir George Stokes, to whom we are about to pay
so touching and deserveda-homage. All his beautiful researches, both
in hydrodynamics as well as in theoretical and practical optics, relate
precisely to those transformations which various media impose on
waves which traverse them.

In the many phenomena which he has discovered or analyzed, move-
ments of fluids, diffraction, interference, fluorescence, Réntgen rays,
the dominant idea which I pointed out to you is always visible. It is
that which makes the harmonious unity of the scientific life of Sir
George Stokes.

The University of Cambridge may be proud of the Lucasian chair
of mathematical physics, because from Sir Isaac Newton up to Sir
George Stokes it has contributed a glorious part toward the progress
of natural philosophy.
THE MOTION OF. A PERFECT LIQUID.’
By Prof. H. S. Hein-SHaw.

If we look across the surface of a river, we can not fail to observe
the difference of the movement at various points. Near one bank the
velocity may be much less than near the other, and generally, though
not always, it is greater in the middle than near either bank. If we
could look beneath the surface and see what was going on there, we
should find that the velocity was not so great near the bottom as at the
top, and was scarcely the same at any two points of the depth. The
more we study the matter, the more complex the motion appears to
be; small floating bodies are not only carried down at different speeds
and across each other’s paths, but are whirled round and round in
small whirlpools, sometimes even disappearing for a time beneath the
surface. By watching floating bodies we can sometimes realize these
complex movements, but they may take place without giving the
slightest evidence of their existence.

You are now looking at water flowing through a channel of varying
cross section, but there is very little evidence of any disturbance taking
place. By admitting color, although its effect is at once visible on the
water, it does not help us much to understand the character of the flow.
If, however, fine bubbles of air are admitted, we at once perceive (fig. 1)
the tumultuous conditions under which the water is moving and that
there is a strong whirlpool action. This may be intensified by closing
in two sides (fig. 2), so as to imitate the action of a sluice gate, through
the narrow opening of which the water has all to pass, the presence of
air making the disturbed behavior of the water very evident.

Now you will readily admit it is hopeless to begin to study the flow
of the water under such conditions, and we naturally ask, Are there not
_ cases in which the action is more simple? Such would be the case if

the water flowed very slowly in a perfectly smooth and parallel river
bed, when the particles would follow one another in lines called ‘* stream
lines,” and the flow would be like the march of a disciplined army

instead of like the movement of a disorderly crowd, in which free
fights taking place at various points may be supposed to resemble the
local disturbances of whirlpools or vortices.

The model (fig. 3) represents on a large scale a section of the channel
already shown, in which groups of particles of the water are indicated
by round balls, lines in the direction of flow of these groups (which, for
convenience, we may call particles) being colored alternately. When I
move these so that the lines are maintained, we imitate ‘‘stream-line ”
motion, and when, at any given point of the pipe, the succeeding par-
ticles always move at exactly the same velocity, we have what is under-
stood as **steady motion.”

As long as all the particles move in the straight portion of the chan-

nel their behavior is easy enough to understand. But as the channel

widens out it is clear that this model does not give us the proper dis-
tribution. In the model the wider portions are not filled up, as they
would be with the natural fluid; for it must be clearly understood that
the stream lines do not flow on as the balls along these wires, passing
through a mass of dead water, but redistribute themselves so that
every particle of water takes part in the flow. Perhaps you may think
that if these wires were removed, and the wooden balls allowed to find
their own positions, they would group themselves as with an actual
liquid. This is not the case; and, for reasons that you will see pres
ently, no model of this kind would give us the real conditions of actual
flow. By means of a model, however, we may be able to understand
why it is so absolutely essential we should realize the correct nature
of the grouping which occurs.

First look at the two diagrams (figs. 4 and 5), which you will see
represent channels of similar form to the experimental one. The
same number of particles enter and leave in each under apparently the
same conditions, so that the idea may naturally arise in your minds
that if the particles ultimately flow with the same speed, whatever their
grouping in the larger portion of the channel, it can not much matter
in what particular kind of formation they actually pass through that
wider portion. To understand that is really very important. Let us
consider a model (fig. 6) specially made for the purpose. You will see
that we have two lines of particles which we may consider stream
lines, those on the left colored white and those on the right colored
red. The first and last are now exactly 18 inches apart, there being
18 balls of 1 inch diameter in the row. If I move the red ones upward,
I cause them to enter a wider portion of the channel, where they will
have to arrange themselves so as to be three abreast (fig 7). It is quite
clear to you that as I do this their speed in the wider portion of the
channel is only one-third of that in the narrow portion, as you will see
from the relative positions of the marked particles. Now, directly the
first particle entered the wider channel, it commenced to move at a

reduced speed, with the result that the particles immediately behind it
must have run up against it, exactly in the same way that you have
often heard the trucks in a goods train run in succession upon the ones
in front when the speed of the engine is reduced; and you will doubt-
less have noticed that it was not necessary for the engine actually to
- stop in order that this might take place. Moreover, the force of the
impact depended largely upon the suddenness with which the speed of
those in front was reduced. Applying this illustration to the model,
you will see that the impact of these particles in the wider portion
would necessarily involye a greater pressure in that part. Turning
next to the white balls, I imitate, by means of the left-hand portion,
the flow which will occur in a channel six times as large as the original
one, and you now see (fig. 7) that as the particles have placed them-
selves six abreast, and the ‘first and last row are 3 inches apart instead
of 18 inches, the speed in the wider portion of the channel must have
been one-sixth of that in the narrow portion. Evidently, therefore,
the velocity of the particles has been reduced more rapidly than in the
previous case, and the pressure must consequently be correspondingly
greater.

We may now take it as perfectly clear and evident that the pressure
is greater in the wider portion and less in the narrower portion of the
channel. Turning now to the two diagrams, we see that the pressure
is in each case greater in every row of particles as in the wider por-
tions of the channel, but that instead of being suddenly increased, as
in the model, it is gradually increased. The width of the colored
bands, that is, rows of particles, or width apart of stream lines, is a
measure of the increased pressure. Thus you will now regard the
width of the bands, or, what is the same thing, the distance apart of
the stream lines, as a direct indication of pressure and the narrowness
or closeness of the stream lines as a direct indication of velocity.

Next notice the great difference between the two diagrams. In one
diagram (fig. 4) the change of width is uniform across the entire sec-
tion. In diagram (fig. 5), however, this is not the case. In the nar-
rowest portion of the channel in each diagram there are seven color
bands of little balls, each containing three abreast, but we find that in
one diagram (fig. +) they are equally spaced in the wider part six
abreast throughout. In the other diagram (fig. 5) the outer row is
spaced eight abreast, the second row rather more than six, and the
inner rows rather more than four abreast, and the middle row less than
four abreast, making in all forty-two in a row, as in the previous
case. One diagram (fig. 5), therefore, will represent an entirely dif-
ferent condition to the state represented by the other diagram (fig. 4),
the pressure in the wide part of the latter varying from a maximum
at the outside to a minimum in the middle, while the corresponding
velocity is greatest in the middle and least at the outside or borders,
110 THE MOTION OF A PERFECT LIQUID.

Now, when we know the pressure at every point of a liquid and also
the direction in which the particles are moving, together with their
velocity at every point, we really know all about its motion, and you
will see how important the question of grouping is, and that, in fact, it
really constitutes the whole point of my lecture to-night. How, then,
shall we ascertain which of the two groupings (fig. 4 or 5) is correct,
or whether possibly some grouping totally different from either does
not represent the real conditions of flow?

Now, the model does not help us very far, because there seems to be
no means of making the grouping follow any regular law which might
agree with fluid motion. In whatever way we improve such a model,
we can scarcely hope to imitate by merely mechanical means the motion
of an actual liquid, for reasons which I will now try to explain.

In the first place, apart from the particles having no distinguishing
characteristics, either when the liquid is opaque or transparent, they
are so small and their number so great as to be almost beyond our
powers of comprehension. Let me try, by means of a simple illustra-
tion, to give some idea of their number as arrived at by perfectly well
recognized methods of physical computation. Lord Kelvin has used
the illustration that, supposing a drop of water were magnified to the
size of the earth, the ultimate particles would appear to us between the
size of cricket balls and footballs. I venture to put the same fact in
another way that may perhaps strike you more forcibly. This tumbler
contains half a pint of water. I now close the top. Suppose that, by
means of a fine hole, I allow one and a half millions of millions
(4,500,000,000,000) of particles to flow out per second-—that is to say, an
exodus equal to about one thousand times the population of the world
in each second—the time required to empty the glass would be between
(for of course we can only give certain limits) seven million and forty-
seven million years.

In the next place, we have the particles interfering with each other’s
movements by what we call ‘‘ viscosity.”

Of course, the general idea of what is meant by a ‘‘ viscous” fluid is
familiar to everybody, as that quality which treacle and tar possess
ina marked degree, glycerin to a less extent, water to a less extent
than glycerin, and alcohol and spirits least of all. In liquids, the
property of viscosity resembles a certain positive ‘‘stickiness” of the
particles to themselves and to other bodies, and would be well repre-
sented in our model by coating over the various balls with some vis-
cous material, or by the clinging together which might take place by
the individuals of a crowd, as contrasted with the absence of this in
the case of no viscosity as represented by the evolutions of a body of
soldiers. It may be accounted for, to a certain extent, by supposing
the particles to possess an irregular shape, or to constantly move
across each other’s path, causing groups of particles to be whirled
round together,

THE MOTION OF A PERFECT LIQUID. LES

Whatever the real nature of viscosity is, it results in producing in
water the eddying motion which would be perfectly impossible if
viscosity were absent, and which makes the problem of the motion of
an imperfect liquid so difficult and perplexing.

Now, all scientific advance in discovering the laws of nature has
been made by first simplifying the problem and reducing it to certain
ideal conditions, and this is what mathematicians have done in study-
ing the motion of a liquid.

We have already seen what almost countless millions of particles
must exist in a very small space, and it does require a much greater
stretch of the imagination to consider their number altogether without
limit. If we then assume that a liquid has no viscosity, and that it is
incompressible, and that the number of particles is infinite, we arrive
at a state of things which would be represented in the case of the
model or the diagram on the wall, when the little globes were per-
fectly smooth, perfectly round, and perfectly hard, all of them in
contact with each other, and with an unlimited number occupying the
smallest part of one of the colored or clear bands. This agrees with
the mathematical conception of a perfect liquid, although the mathe-
matician has in his mind the idea of something of the nature of a jelly
consisting of such small particles, rather than of the separate particles
themselves. The solution of the problem of the grouping of the little
particles, upon which so much depends, and which may have at first
seemed so simple a matter, really represents, though as yet applied
to only a few simple cases, one of the most remarkable instances of
the power of higher mathematics, and one of the greatest achievements
of mathematical genius.

You will be as glad as Lam that it is not my business to-night to
explain the mathematical processes by which the behavior of a perfect
liquid has been, to a certain extent, investigated. You will also under-
stand why such models as we could actually make, or any analogy with
the things with which we are familiar, would not help us very much
in obtaining a mental picture of the behavior of a perfect liquid. If,
for instance, we try to make use of the idea of drilled soldiers, and
move the lines with that object in view, we see that instead of the
ordinary methods of drill, the middle rank soon gains on the others,
and enters again the parallel portion of the channel in a very different
relative position to the opposite lines, although the stream lines would
all have the same actual velocity when once again in the parallel por-
tion. Since, then, we can not use models or any simple analogy with
familiar things, or follow—at any rate this evening—the mathematical
methods of dealing with the problem, what way of understanding the
subject is left to us?

If we take two sheets of glass, and bring them nearly close together,
leaving only a space the thickness of a thin card or piece of paper, and
1 THE MOTION OF A PERFECT LIQUID.

then by suitable means cause liquid to flow under pressure between
them, the very property of viscosity, which, as before noted, is the
cause of the eddying motion in large bodies of water, in the present
‘ase greatly limits the freedom of motion of the fluid between the two
sheets of glass, and thus prevents, not only eddying or whirling motion,
but also counteracts the effect of inertia. Every particle is then com-
pelled by the pressure behind and around it to move onward without
whirling motion, following the path which corresponds exactly with
the stream lines in a perfect liquid.

If we now, by a suitable means, allow distinguishing bands of col-
ored liquid to take part in the general flow, we are able to imitate
exactly the conditions we are seeking to understand.

[Professor Hele-Shaw here gave demonstrations of the stream lines
in liquids flowing under the conditions of a gradually enlarging and
contracting channel. He proved that the condition of flow corre-
sponded closely with that shown in fig. 5 and not with that given in
fig. 4. The method of the experiments has already been described in
Nature, Vol. LVIIT, p. 34, though by using glycerin instead of water
much more perfect results were obtained than in those then described. |

But at this stage you may reasonably inquire how it is that we are
able to state with so much certainty that the artificial conditions of
flow with a viscous liquid are really giving us the stream-line motion
of a perfect one; and this brings me to the results which mathematicians
have obtained.

The view now shown represents a body of circular cross section,
past which a fluid of infinite extent is moving, and the lines are plotted
from mathematical investigation and represents the flow of particles.
This particular case gives us the means of most elaborate comparison.
Although we can not employ a fluid of infinite extent, we can prepare
the border of the channel to correspond with any one of the particular
stream lines and measure the exact positions of the lines inside.

By means of a second lantern the real flow of a viscous liquid for
this case is shown upon the second screen, and you will see that it
agrees with the calculated flow round a similar obstacle of a perfect
liquid. The diagram shown on the wall is the actual figure employed
for comparison and upon which the experimental case was projected.
By this means it was proved that the two were in absolute agreement.
If we start the impulses as before, in a row, we at once see how the
middle particles lag behind the outer ones, as indicated by the width
of the bands, showing that it is not necessarily the side stream lines
that move more slowly. It may be more interesting to you to see, in
addition to the foregoing case—in which, for convenience, and as quite
sufficient for measurement only, a semicylinder was employed—the
case of a complete cylinder (fig. 8). In this case two different colors
are used in alternate bands, and these bands are sent in, not steadily,

but impulsively, in order to illustrate what I haye just pointed out.
You will see how the greater width of the color bands before and
behind the cylinder indicates an increase of pressure in those regions.
This, in a ship-shape form, accounts for the standing bow and stern
waves, whereas the narrowing of the bands at the sides indicates an
increase of velocity and reduction of pressure, and accounts for the
depression of water level, with which you are doubtless familiar, at
the corresponding part of a ship.

I will now take a more striking case. If, instead of a circular body,
we had a flat plate, the turbulent nature of the flow is evidently very
great, as you will see from the view (fig. 9), which is a photograph of
the actual flow under these conditions, made visible by very fine air
bubbles, and showing water at rest in the clear space behind the obstacle.

We can, however, take steps to reduce this turbulence, and you now
see on the second screen the flow by means of apparatus which time
does not permit me to describe, but which gives a slow and steady
motion that it would be impossible to improve upon in actual con-
ditions of practice, or even, I am inclined to think, by any experimental
method. Instead of using air to make this flow clear, we now allow
color to stream behind the plate, and you will see that the water still
refuses to flow round to the back, and spreads on either side. We
have so slow a velocity as not to induce vortex motion, but the inertia
of the particles which strike the flat plate causes them to be deflected
to either side, exactly as tennis balls in striking against a wall obliquely.
The sheet of water is so thick—that is to say, the parallel glass plates
are so far apart—that they do not enable the viscosity of the water to
act as a sufficient drag to prevent this taking place.

Mathematicians, however, predicted with absolute certainty that
with stream-line motion, the water should flow round and meet at the
back, a state of things that, however slow we make the motion in the
present case, does not occur, owing to the effect of inertia. They have
drawn with equal confidence the lines along which this should take
place. We could either effect this result with the experiment you
have just seen, by using a much more viscous liquid, such as treacle,
or, what comes to the same thing, bringing the two sheets of glass
nearly close together; and the flow which you are now witnessing
(fig. 10) shows the result of doing this. The color bands in front of
the plate no longer mix at all with the general body of flow, or are
unsteady, as was the case in the last experiment, but flow round the
plate, and flow so steadily, that unless we jerk the flow of the color
bands, it is impossible to tell in which direction they are actually
moving. It is interesting to note that where the divided central color -
band reunites is clearly shown in the illustration.

While I have been dealing with the stream lines of a perfect liquid
your minds will doubtless have turned to the lines along which mag-

netic and electric forces appear to act. Weare possibly further from
realizing the actual nature of these forces than from a correct concep-
tion of the real nature of a liquid. We have long agreed to abandon
the old ideas of the electrical and magnetic fluids flowing along these
lines, and to substitute instead the idea that these lines represent
merely the directions in which the forces act. Now we can easily see
that this conception is quite a reasonable one, for in the case of the
model it is not necessary to have the row of balls actually moving in
order that the effect may be transmitted along the different lines they
occupy. If I attempt to raise the plate upon which they rest, the
pressure is instantly transmitted through the whole row to the top ball
along each line, whatever curve the line may take. In the same way,
you will remember that it was not necessary to have the color bands —
actually in motion, for, though apparently free to move in any direc-
tion, they retain their form for a considerable time, and the path along
which they would influence each other as soon as the tap is opened
would be along those lines in which the liquid was flowing before it
was brought to rest. Hence it is possible, with some suitable means,
to cause a viscous liquid to reproduce exactly the lines of magnetic
and electrical induction. In the case of magnetism and electricity it
is, of course, possible, by means of a small magnetic needle or a gal-
vanometer, by exploring the whole surface through which magnetic
induction or electrical flow is acting, to plot the lines of force for
innumerable cases, where we can work in air or on the surface of the
solid conductor.

But in this building it seems natural to take as an example the case—
first used by the great man to whom the conception of lines of mag-_
netic force is due, for the first reference I have been able to find to
such lines is in one of Faraday’s earliest papers on the indication of
electric currents Ne sa Researches in Electricity, Vol. I, p. 32),
in which he says:

a . ae oe

** By magnetic curves I mean the lines of magnetic forces, —
modified by the juxtaposition of poles, which would be depicted 4
iron filings, or those to which a very small magnetic needle would form
a tangent.”

You are all familiar with the way in which iron filings set themselves
when shaken over the north and south poles of a magnet. The mag-
netic lines are then nearly, but not quite, circular curves between the
two poles. Now, the mathematics of the subject tell us that if the
poles could be regarded as points, the lines of force between them
would be perfect circles.

You are now looking at the color bands, the edges, or indeed any
portion of which represent lines obtained by admitting colored liquid
from a series of small holes round a central small orifice which admits:
clear liquid and allows them to escape through another small orifice

(called, respectively, in hydromechanies a sowrce and sink), and I leave
it to you to judge how far these curves deviate from the ideal form.

My assistant is now allowing the color to flow, first steadily, and
then in a series of impulses, and the latter gives up the conception of
waves or impulses of magnetic force, though of course the magnetic
transmission force would be instantaneous. Regarded as a liquid, it
is here again clear how absolutely the truth of our views concern-
ing the slower movement in the wider portion is verified by this
experiment.

A last experiment shows the streams admitted, not from a source,
but from a row of orifices in what corresponds to the slowest moving
portion of the flow. The result is that the color bands are much nar-
rower, and although the circular forms of the curves are, as in the
previous experiment, preserved, the lines are so fine at the point of
exit, which, as before, corresponds to the South Pole, as to really
approximate to ideal stream lines.

The same method enables us to trace the lines of force through solid
conductors, for as long as we confine ourselves to two dimensions of
space we may have fat conductors of any shape whatever. But it
does something more, for by making the film rather deeper in some
places than others more particles arrange themselves there, and the
lines of flow will naturally tend in the direction of the deeper portion.
This will give the stream lines identically the same shape as the mag-
netic or electrical curves which encounter in their paths a body of less
resistance—for instance, a paramagnetic body.

If, on the other hand, at these points the film is made rather thinner,
less particles will be able to dispose of themselves in the shallow por-
tion of the film, and hence the lines of flow will be pushed away from
this portion, giving us exactly the same forms as magnetic lines of
force in a magnetic field in proximity to a diamagnetic body.

Here, again, mathematical methods have enabled lines of actual flow
to be predicted, and you may compare the actual flow for the case of
a cylindrical paramagnetic body which was worked out some years ago.

You will doubtless not be inclined to question the practical value of
stream lines in the subject which we have just been considering,
because, unlike the flow of an actual liquid, magnetic lines of force
can never be themselves seen, and because there is no doubt as to the
correspondence of the directions to the lines of a perfect liquid. It
was the conception of these lines in the mind of Faraday, and more
particularly their being cut by a moving wire, that enabled him to
realize the nature of the subject more clearly than any other man at
the time, and to do much toward the rapid development of electrical
science and its practical applications.

When we come to consider the relation of the study of the motion
of a perfect liquid with hydromechanics and naval architecture, it must

116 THE MOTION OF A PERFECT LIQUID.

be admitted that the matter is a difficult one. Probably one of the
most perplexing things in engineering science is the absence of all
apparent connection between higher treatises on hydrodynamics and
the vast array of works on practical hydraulics. The natural connec-
tion between the treatises of mathematicians and experimental
researches of engineers would appear to be obvious, but very little, if
any, such connection exists in reality, and while at every step electrical
applications owe much to the theories which are common to electricity
and hydromechanics, we look in vain for such applications in connection
with the actual flow of water.

Now the reason for this appears to be the immense difference between
the flow of an actual liquid and that of a perfect one owing to the
property of viscosity. A comparison of the various experiments which
you haye seen to some extent indicates this.

In the first place, let us consider for a moment some of the things
which would happen if water were a perfect liquid. In such a case,
a ship would experience a very different amount of resistance, because,
although waves would be raised, owing to the reasons which we have
already seen, the chief causes of resistance, viz, skin friction and eddy-
ing motion, would be entirely absent, and of course a submarine boat
at a certain depth would experience no resistance at all, since the pres-
sures fore and aft would be equal. On the other hand, there would
be no waves raised by the action of the wind, and there would be no
tidal flow, but to make up for this rivers would flow with incredible
velocity, since there would be no retarding forces owing to the fric-
tion of the banks. But the rivers themselves would soon cease to flow
because there would be no rainfall such as exists at present, since it is
due to viscosity that the rain is distributed, instead of falling upon the
earth in a solid mass when condensed. In a word, it may be said that
the absence of viscosity in water would result in changes which it is
impossible to realize.

We may now briefly try to consider the difference between practical
hydraulics and the mathematical treatment of a perfect liquid. The
sarliest attempts to investigate in a scientific way the flow of water
appears to have been made by a Roman engineer about eighteen hun-
dred years ago, an effort being made to find the law for the flow of
water from an orifice. For more than fifteen hundred years, however,
even the simple principle of flow according to which the velocity of
efflux varies as the square of the head, or what is the same thing, the
height of surface above the orifice varies as the square of velocity,
remained unknown. Torricelli, who discovered this, did so as the
result of observing that a jet of water rose nearly to the height of the

surface of the body of water from which it issued, and concluded there- |

fore that it obeyed the then recently discovered law of ail falling
bodies.

Though it was obvious that this law did not exactly hold, it was a
long time before it was realized that it was the friction or viscosity of
liquids that caused so marked a deviation from the simple theory.
- Since then problems in practical hydraulics, whether in connection
with the flow of rivers or pipes, or the resistance of ships, have largely
consisted in the determination of the amount of deviation from the
foregoing simple law.

About one hundred years ago it was discovered that the resistance
of friction varies nearly in accordance with the simple law of Torri-
celli, and also, although for a totally different reason, the resistances
due toa sudden contraction or enlargement of cross section of channel or
to any sudden obstructions appear to follow nearly the same law. Now
it is extremely convenient for reasons which will be understood by stu-
dents of hydraulics to treat all kinds of resistance as following the
same law, viz, square of velocity which the variation of head or height
of surface has shown to do. But this is far from being exact, and an
enormous amount of labor has consequently been expended in finding
for all conceivable conditions in actual work tables of coefficients or
empirical expressions which are required for calculations of various
practical questions. Such data are continually being accumulated in
connection with the flow of water in rivers and pipes for hydraulic
motors and naval architecture. This is the practical side of the ques
tion.

On the other hand, eminent mathematicians, since the days of New-
ton and the discovery of the method of the calculus, have been pursuing
the investigation of the behavior of a perfect liquid. The mathemat-
ical methods, which I have already alluded to as being so wonderful,
have, however, scarcely been brought to bear with any apparent result
upon the behavior of a viscous fluid. Indeed the mathematician has
not been really able to adopt the method of the practical investigator
and deal with useful forms of bodies such as those of actual ships, or
of liquid moving through ordinary channels of varying section, even
for the case of a perfect liquid, but he has had to take those cases, and
they are very few indeed, that he has been able to discoyer which fit in
with his mathematical powers of treatment.

This brief summary may possibly serve to indicate the nature of the
difficulties which I have pointed out, and will show you the yast field
there yet lies open for research in connection with the subject of hydro-
mechanics, and the great reception which awaits the discovery of a
theoretical method of completely dealing with viscous liquids, instead
of having recourse as at present principally to empirical formulas based
on the simple law already alluded to.

We may, however, console ourselves with the thought that in the
application of the laws of motion themselves to any terrestrial matters
the friction of bodies must always be taken into account, and renders
118 THE MOTION OF A PERFECT LIQUID.

it necessary that we should commence by studying the ideal conditions.
In this, as in other matters, the naval architect and engineer must
always endeavor, as far as possible, to base their considerations and
work upon the secure foundation of scientific knowledge, making allow-
ances for disturbing causes, which then cease to be the source of per-
plexity and confusion. From this point of view the study of the
behavior of a perfect liquid, even when no such form of matter appears
to exist, has an interest for the practical man in spite of the deviation
of actual liquids from such ideal conditions. If the truth must be told,
it is such a deviation from the simple and ideal conditions that really
constitutes the work of a professional man, and it is only practical
experience which, based upon sound technical knowledge, enables
50,000 tons of steel to be made to span the Firth of Forth, Niagara to
be harnessed to do the work of 100,000 horses, or an Oceanic to be slid
into the sea with as little misgiving as the launch of a fishing boat.

T have, I am afraid, brought you only to the threshold of a vast sub-
ject, and in doing so have possibly employed reasoning of too ele-
mentary a kind. After all, I may plead that I have followed the dictum
of Faraday, who said, ‘‘ If assumptions must be made, it is better to
assume as little as possible.” If I have assumed too little knowledge
on your part, it is because of the difficulties I have found in the subject
myself. If I have left more obscure than I have been able to make
clear, it is consoling to think how many centuries were required to
discover even what is known at the present time, and we may well be
forgiven if we can not grasp at once results which represent the life
work of some of the greatest men.
