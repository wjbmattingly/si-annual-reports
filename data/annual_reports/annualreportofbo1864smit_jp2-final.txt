PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION

' OF THE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 13, 1847.]

ENP OY torr PON:

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a Plan
of Organization.

1. Witu oF Suituson.. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, ‘‘to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.’’

2.The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government
of the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of
the testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently
supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and
perpetuate his name.

4. The objects of the Institution are, Ist, to increase, and 2d, to
diffuse knowledge among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.
The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition
of new truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus in-
creased, among men. |

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge ; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths ; and can be most exten-
sively diffused among men by means of the press,

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should
be such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of
increasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either
at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provi-
sionally ; can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or
be abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice’ of the funds.
8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time
occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution,
a considerable portion of the interest which has accrued should be
added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated,
the funds are small. Economy should, therefore, be consulted in the
construction of the building ; and not only the first cost of the edifice
should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in
repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected
with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-
ported by the Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined
by the plan of the organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be
benefited by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expen-
diture on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of
the act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a library,
a museum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal scale to
contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of Organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

To INCREASE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-
ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths ; and,

2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular
researches, under the direction of suitable persons.

To DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the
different branches of knowledge ; and,

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.

I. By stimulating researches.

1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all
branches of knowledge. :

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of vol-
umes, in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.

3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9

publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human
knowledge, resting on original research ; and all unverified specula-
tions to be rejected.

4. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for
examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in
the branch to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for
publication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.

5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution,
and the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless
a favorable decision be made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the Trans-
actions of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to
all the colleges and principal libraries, in this country. One part of
the remaining copies may be offered for sale ; and the other carefully
preserved, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand
from new institutions.

7. Anabstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs
to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to
Congress.

II. By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects
of research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The objects and the amount appropriated, to be recommended
by counsellors of the Institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different objects; so that
in course of time each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published,
with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge.

4, Kxamples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving
the problem of American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,
magnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the
formation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.

(5.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determina-
tion of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of
light ; chemical analyses of soils and plants ; collection and publica-
tion of scientific facts, accumulated in the offices of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches, and accurate surveys of places celebrated
in American history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the
different racesof men in North America; also, explorations and ac-
curate surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people
of our country.
10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I. By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new
discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year in
all branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally in-
teresting, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some
of the reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals,
as the income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of
knowledge may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the
different branches of knowledge. ‘

3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publi-
cations, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his
report ; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on
the title-page of the report.

4. The reports to be published in separate parts, so- that persons
interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it
without purchasing the whole.

5. These reports may be presented to Congress, for partial distri-
bution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific in-
stitutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in
the reports :*

I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,
and meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4. Application of science to arts.

II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,
antiquities, &c.

6. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.
8. A survey of the political events of the world ; penal reform, &c.

III. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

9. Modern literature.

10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.

12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.

Il. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs
translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the

*This part of the plan has been but partially carried out.
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 11

direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the
best exposition of a given subject.

2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission
of competent judges, previous to their publication.

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of
the present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in
the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of
the Board of Regents providing for the two modes of increasing and
diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated
the formation of a library and a museum; and the Board of Regents,
including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide
the incomé* into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge
by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme
before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation
of a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be re-
quired, consisting, Ist, of a complete collection of the transactions
and proceedings of all the learned societies in the world; 2d, of the
more important current periodical publications, and other works
necessary in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of
objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

6. Also, a collection of instruments of .research in all branches of
experimental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those
mentioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the
United States should be procured, in order that the valuable books
first purchased may be such as are not to be found in the United
States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of biblio-
graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any
work which he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase
by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-
vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary
to purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art
casts of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

12 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of
expense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other
similar societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of
antiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, be-
sides the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except
one, to act as librarian. ;

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to
the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,
keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and
keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents,
employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,
will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit
new objects of art. Distinguished individuals should also be invited
to give lectures on subjects of general interest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has be-
come the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change
is that expressed by the following resolutions, adopted January 15,
1855, viz:

Resolved, That the Tth resolution passed by the Board of Regents,
on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the
income between the active operations and the museum and library,
when the buildings are completed, be, and it is hereby, repealed.

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution, in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,
be necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-
ance and a compliance in good faith with the law.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN : The duty of presenting to you the annual report of
the operations and state of the Smithsonian Institution recurs, on
this occasion, under peculiar circumstances. On the 24th of last
month, the day before that designated for the annual meeting of the
Board, a fire occurred, of which an account is given in the Report
of a Special Committee. It destroyed the documents contained in
the Secretary’s office, and among these was the manuscript of the
annual report, which was ready for presentation. The destruction
of this involved the necessity of rewriting the whole article, and has
delayed its presentation until the present time.

Another circumstance which characterizes our present meeting is
that, for the first. time in the history of the Institution, not one of
those who constituted the original Board of Regents is now in attend-
ance. With the exception of a single member, (Professor Bache, )
_ who is seeking in a foreign country the restoration of his health,
an entire change has taken place in the personal composition of the
Board. This change has been much more rapid during the last four
years, or since the commencement of the war. Within that period,
death has repeatedly cast its shadow over the Institution. Indeed,
the number of those connected with the establishment who have
departed this life since the epoch mentioned exceeds the number in
all the years that preceded. The death of Judge Douglas, of Illinois,
of Senator Pearce, of Maryland, and that of Dr. Felton, of Cambridge,
all prominent members of the Board, were communicated at the last
and the preceding meetings; and I have now to add, as having oc-
curred since the last session, the death of General Totten, who was
one of the Regents named in the original act of Congress organizing
the Institution, and who continued during life to be an active member
of the Board, and by repeated election, one of the executive commit-
tee; that of Chief Justice Taney, who ever evinced a lively interest
in the welfare of the Institution, was one of the original members
of the Board, and for a long time held the office of its chairman; and,
lastly, that of Judge Dayton, whose decease, in the full enjoyment of

>
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the honors of his high position as the representative of his country
at the court of France, we have recently been called to mourn.
Though the latter was unable to attend the meetings of the Board,
he rendered good service to the Institution in extending its reputa-
tion and promoting its correspondence abroad. Besides this mortality
among the Regents, there have also occurred in the same period four
deaths among the assistants and employés of the establishment, and
two among the honorary members, making twelve in number thus
removed.

This rapidly recurring mortality has not failed to impress me pro-
foundly with the instability and uncertainty of life, and has led
me, in view of the late conflagration and the loss of the counsel of
those to whose generous and zealous co-operation I have been so long
indebted, to regard with more than usual solicitude the proper dis-
charge of the responsible duties which are intrusted to me as the
principal executive officer of the establishment.

Yet, however grieved at the loss occasioned by the fire, and sad-
dened by the departure of those to whom I have just referred, I have
not permitted myself for a moment to doubt that I shall continue to
find in the present members the same cordial co-operation and liberal
support which has characterized the guardians of the Institution for
the past twelve years. Whatever may have been the diversity of
views previous to that period, no difference of opinion has since been
expressed as to the propriety of the general policy which has gov-
erned the operations of the establishment, nor has a doubt been inti-
mated as to the value of the results produced or their strict conformity
with the intentions of Smithson. This harmony is, perhaps, more
worthy of remark, when it is remembered that in the choice of the
Regents they have been designedly selected by Congress from each
of the prominent political parties of the day. ‘Men of the most con-
flicting opinions meet here as on a common ground of friendly sym-
pathy, impressed with the feeling that rivalry and prejudice should
hold no sway in the presence of interests whose, universality and
permanency properly withdraw them from the sphere of popular and
temporary excitement. Hence my enforcement of the rule excluding
from the lecture-room of the Institution topics of a partisan and irri-
tating character has been fully sustained; while, at the same time,
the course which has been pursued of rendering the government in
its late trials every aid which could be supplied by scientific re-
search has been warmly approved.

As most persons are probably entirely ignorant of the services
, REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

really rendered to the government by the Institution, I may here state
the fact that a large share of my time—all, indeed, which could be
spared from official duties—has been devoted for the last four years to
investigations required by the public exigencies. Within this period
several hundred reports, requiring many experiments, and pertaining
either to proposals purporting to be of high national importance, or
relating to the quality of the multifarious articles offered in fulfilment
of legal contracts, have been rendered. The opinions advanced in
many of these reports not only cost much valuable time, but also in-
volved grave responsibilities. While, on the one hand, the rejection
of a proposition would be in contravention to the high importance
claimed for it by its author, on the other the approval of it would per-
haps incur the risk of the fruitless expenditure of a large amount of
public money. It is not necessary, I trust, to say that the labor thus
rendered was entirely gratuitous, or that in the judgment pronounced
in any case no regard was paid to the interested solicitations or per-
sonal influence of the parties concerned; on the contrary, it has in
some instances resulted from the examination of materials sold to the
government that attempted fraud has been exposed and the baffled
speculator received his due reward in condemnation and punishment.
These facts, it is thought, will be deemed a sufficient answer to
those who have seemed disposed to reproach the Institution with the
want of a more popular demonstration, but far less useful or efficient
aid in the support of the government.

At the close of 1864 the affairs of the Institution were in a highly
prosperous condition. It will be seen by a reference to the report
of the executive committee that—

First. The whole amount of money originally derived from the
bequest of Smithson is still in the treasury of the United States,
bearing interest at six per cent., paid semi-annually, and yielding
_ $30,910.

Second. Seventy-five thousand dollars of an extra fund are in
bonds of the State of Indiana, at five per cent. interest, also paid
semi-annually, yielding $3,750.

Third. Fifty-three thousand five hundred dollars of the same fund
are in bonds of the State of Virginia, twelve thousand in those of
Tennessee, and five hundred in those of Georgia, from which nothing
has been derived since the commencement of the war.

Fourth. A balance of upwards of $29,000 is now in the hands of
the treasurer of the Institution. The only difference in this state-
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ment and that of last year is that the balance now in the hands of
the treasurer is $2,500 less than before. This difference is mainly
due to the increase of prices and the consequent necessity of a greater
expenditure in carrying on the ordinary operations.

In view of the great expenditures of the government on account of
the war, the Institution did not at first claim, as it might reasonably
have done, to have the annual income from the original bequest paid
in specie, as all the older funded debts of the United States are paid.
But since a large outlay will be required to repair the damages caused
by the fire, the necessity could not be avoided of calling the atten-
tion of the Secretary of the Treasury to this measure. That this
claim is a just one was the unanimous opinion of the Board of
Regents, and among them of Chief Justice Chase, and in accordance
with the instructions of the Board I have presented this matter to
the department. It was referred by the Secretary to his legal ad-
viser, the Solicitor of the Treasury, who has decided that in accord-
ance with the usage of the government the Institution is entitled to
receive the interest from the original bequest of Smithson in coin.
The premium on this will therefore, in future, increase the balance
in the hands of the treasurer.*

It was mentioned in the last report that a part of the original be-
quest, amounting to £5,015, was left by Mr. Rush in England as the
principal to secure an annuity payable to the mother of Smithson’s
nephew. The annuitant having died, a power of attorney was sent
in November, 1862, to Messrs Fladgate, Clark and Finch, (the same
firm originally employed by Mr. Rush,) to collect the money. After
a considerable delay, arising principally from technical difficulties,
the money was obtained and deposited to the order of the Institution,
with George Peabody & Co., bankers, London. It was subsequently
drawn through the agency of the Secretary of the Treasury, and, in
accordance with the law of Congress directing that the money of the
Smithsonian bequest should be invested in United States securities,
it was expended in the purchase of government bonds, bearing in-
terest at the rate of 7,3; per cent. The amount realized in bonds of
this denomination, at par, was $54,150. It was at first supposed that
this money, or at least the interest upon it, could immediately be ap-
plied to the uses of the Institution, but from a critical examination
of the enactments of Congress in reference to the Smithsonian fund,

* The premium on the coin received since the presentation of the report, on account of the
interest due Ist January, was $7,472 70, which sum added to $29,484 08 gives $36,956 78
as the amount in the hands of the treasurer
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

it was found that the appropriation of the bequest by the act organ-
izing the establishment in 1846, related only to that part of the be-
quest which had already been received, and made no provision for
the disposition of the residuary legacy which has just become avail-
able. It can scarcely be doubted, however, but that Congress in-
tended to appropriate the whole of the bequest to the maintenance
of the establishment; still, for this purpose, a special act will be
required, and it is desirable that the sum recently received be de-
posited in the treasury on the same condition with the amount origi-
nally obtained, that the interest alone shall be subject to expenditure.
In this connexion it is proper to remark that Mr. Peabody, who
received the deposit of the fund, so far from claiming the usual com-
mission, allowed four per cent. on the money while it remained in his
hands.

It will be seen from what follows in this report that all parts of the
programme have been prosecuted during the past year with as much
energy as the means at our disposal would permit, and that although,
in some particulars, not as much has been accomplished as in pre-
vious years, the inequality will, it is hoped, be attributed, as it is
properly referable, to the difficulties under which the Institution, in
common with the whole country, has been laboring.

Publications.—The whole number of pages issued during the year
amount to 872 quarto and 1,657 octavo.

The thirteenth volume of the Contributions has been distributed to
public libraries, and the fourteenth is nearly completed, and will be
published in the course of a few months. It will consist of the fol-
lowing papers:

1. The third and fourth series or concluding parts of the discus-
sion of the magnetic and meteorological observations, made at the
Girard College observatory, Philadelphia, by Professor A. D. Bache,
Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey.

2. On the construction of a silvered glass telescope, 15} inches in
aperture, and its use in celestial photography, by Dr. Henry Dra-
per, of the University of New York.

3. A memoir on the palzontology of the Upper Missouri, by F.
B. Meek and F. V. Hayden.—Part 1.

4. A memoir on the cretaceous reptiles of the United States, by
Dr. Joseph Leidy, of the University of Pennsylvania.

It was intended that Dr. Dean’s paper on the medulla oblongata,

described in the last report, and partially distributed in separate num-
28
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

bers during the year, should form a part of this volume ; unfortu-
nately, however, the plates intended for its illustration were destroyed
in the fire, and its place in the volume has been supplied by the fourth
article, which has since been presented for publication.

In the reports for the last three years an account has been given
of a series of papers containing the deductions from the magnetic ob-
servations at Girard College, Philadelphia, by Professor A. D. Bache,
Superintendent United States Coast Survey. The whole of this series
of papers was divided into four sections, each containing three parts.
The object of the whole series is to present the results deduced from
the changes observed in the direction and intensity of the magnetic
force of the earth as apparently affected by the position of the sun
and moon relative to the earth and to each other.

The first section related to the disturbances in the line of the de-
clination, or of the fitful variation, as it is called, of the magnetic
needle, and to the regular variations of the declination.

The second section related to the variation in the intensity of the
magnetic force of the earth, estimated in a horizontal direction.

The third section related to the same force as estimated in a verti-
cal direction.

The fourth section relates to the perturbations or fitful changes in
the direction and intensity of the total magnetic force of the earth
as estimated in the direction of the dipping needle.

The first three of these sections have been described in previous
reports, and it now only remains to give an account of the fourth and
last.

The data for the deductions given in this section are the quantities
observed in the variations of the horizontal and vertical components
of the magnetic force, expressed in minute scale divisions corrected
for progressive changes in the magnetism of the bars and for changes
due to temperature. The object of the investigation was to deter-
-mine the law of the great disturbances to which the total intensity
and direction of the magnetic force of the earth is subjected. It is
well known that the intensity and direction of the magnetic force of
the earth do not remain the same from hour to hour, but are subject
to regular fluctuations connected with the day and the season, and
also to larger perturbations, which have until lately been considered
fitful, and have therefore received the name of magnetic storms. The
special object of investigation of the first part of the fourth series is
to ascertain the average character of the large disturbances, and to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

deduce, if possible, the law by which they are governed. This is
the most intricate part of the whole series, and is the final object to
which the preceding investigations were preparatory. From a care-
ful study of all the observations on the dip, it was found that 1,446
might be considered as giving abnormal values, and of the total force
of the earth’s magnetism 1,470 indicated abnormal changes, which
amounted to about one-fifteenth part of the whole number of obser-
‘vations. These abnormal disturbances were analyzed in relation to
their frequency during the hours of the day, the month of the year,
and successive years ; they were also studied as to their tendency to
exhibit an increase or diminution in their variations and the times of
the greatest and least action in relation to the periods above men-
tioned. This part ends with a table of the relative magnitude of the
disturbances and a comparison of those of Toronto and Philadelphia,
from which it appears that in some cases there is an agreement in
the character of the simultaneous changes in the two places, and at
others not.

The second part of the fourth section treats of the solar diurnal
and annual inequality of the dip and total force, that is, of the changes
due to the sun which take place in the dip and total force from
hour to hour and from month to month. In this investigation all the
greater perturbations are omitted and the laws of the simpler
or more normal changes are sought. The diurnal changes in the dip
are shown analytically and graphically for each month and for the
whole year. The general character of the curve exhibits a maxi-
mum at about 11 a. m. and a minimum atabout 5 a. m., with a range
of one minute and two-tenths—a quantity too minute to be recognized
by the ordinary dip circle, and which can only be observed by the
differential reflecting instrument. In summer the epochs occur ear-
lier, with a range of a minute and a half, while in winter they occur
later, with a range of only one minute. There is also a secondary
fluctuation of small magnitude. The diurnal deviation of the dip is
greatest about the time of the equinoxes, and of these maxima that
of the winter is the least. The diurnal changes in the total force as
deduced from the average of the year are represented by a single
crested curve, but from the average of the observations in winter
alone this assumes the form of a double curve. The principal maxi-
mum as deduced from the whole year coincides with the hour of
_ 2p. m., and in winter occurs about an hour and ahalf earlier. The
principal minimum coincides with 10 p. m., and occurs in winter about
two hours earlier. This part ends with an attempt to deduce from
the data the annual changes in dip and intensity. The result, how-
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ever, is not entirely satisfactory on account of the large disturbances
due to variations of temperature, changes of the magnetism and ad-
justment of the instrument.

The third part of the fourth section, or the twelfth part of the
entire series, contains the result of the observations made with a
portable dip circle constructed by Robinson, of London, the same
which had been previously used by Professor Bache in his magnetic
observations in Pennsylvania and adjacent States, and alsoin Europe.
The observations were made weekly during a period of nearly two
and a half years; the monthly and annual mean observations of the
dip were tabulated and were found to indicate an annual decrease of
one minute and two-tenths in this element. The same paper con-
tains a collection of observations on the dip at different points in
Philadelphia by different observers, from which a similar change in
the dip has been deduced. The least dip occurred in January, 1840,
and increased for several years after that date. It is probable, how-
ever, from some subsequent investigations by Mr. Schott of observa-
tions at other places, that the minimum obtained at Philadelphia,
above mentioned, was of a secondary character, and that a still
smaller dip will hereafter be observed. But this point will be cleared
up in a few years by observations now in process of collection. The
discussion of this part, and indeed the whole of the series, ends
with a table of magnetic constants for Girard College, namely: of
the declination, or variation, as it is sometimes called; of the dip;
of the horizontal, vertical, and total force, all expressed in absolute
measures, for five different epochs and for one mean epoch, that for
January, 1843, for which the declination is 3° 32’ W., the dip 71° 59’
N., the horizontal force 4.173, the vertical force 12.83, and the total
force 13.49, in units of one foot, one grain, and one second of mean
time.

From all the investigations on this subject up to the present time
we may infer, first, that the earth is a great magnet, having a natural,
and in one sense a permanent, polarity; second, that this polarity
is disturbed in intensity and direction by the varying effect of the
heat of the sun; third, that the magnetism of the earth is affected
by that of the sun and moon; and fourth, it is probable that magnetic
polarity is common to all the bodies of the solar system.

The second paper in the thirteenth volume of the Contributions-—
that on the silvered glass telescope—is fully described in an article
at the end of this report, copied from the ‘‘ Intellectual Observer,’’
of London.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AL

The third paper in the volume, on the palwontology of the Upper
Missouri, was described in the last report. It occupies 158 pages,
and is illustrated by five plates of figures engraved on stone.

A full account of the fourth paper, on the cretaceous reptiles of
the United States, as given by the author, is also appended at the
close of this report.

Miscellaneous Collections.—On account of the continued increase in
the price of printing and paper, and the unexpected length to which
some of the works were tending, I thought it advisable to suspend,
for the present, the general publication of this series. Of the list
of works it comprised, as given in previous reports, the only ones
published since the last session of the Board are the second part of
Binney’s Bibliography of American Conchology, Meek’s Check Lists
of Fossils, and the supplement to Loew’s Diptera.

The first of these contains an account of the writings of foreign
naturalists relative to American conchology, and also additions and
corrections of the first volume, with a copious index of authors and
names of species. It forms an octavo volume of 300 pages.

The second work consists of check lists of all the species of creta-
ceous, jurassic, and miocene invertebrate fossils of North America
which had been described up to the end of 1863. These constitute an
important aid in the labor of cataloguing and labelling collections.
The manuscript of another number of the same series, prepared by
Mr. Conrad, of Philadelphia, has been received. It gives a list of the
eocene invertebrate fossils, and, as the work is much wanted to assist
in the distribution of specimens, it will be put to. press immediately.

The other article of the Miscellaneous Collections published during
the past year is the supplement and completion of the second part
of the monograph of the Diptera of North America, by H. Loew.
A general account of the work on the diptera (comprising flies, mus-
quitoes, &c.) is given in the report for 1861. This order of insects
has perhaps a wider distribution than any other known, and, from
the variety and the minuteness of the specimens, is difficult of study
and classification. Before attempting to give a monograph of the
whole order, it was thought proper to print a catalogue of all the
genera which had been described, and this work (prepared by Baron
Osten Sacken) was published in 1858. The preparation of the mon-
ograph was intrusted to Dr. H. Loew, of Meseritz, Prussia, one of
the most eminent naturalists in this line now living.

In the first part of this work is an essay on the terminology of

/
3 - REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

diptera, a sketch of the systematic arrangement of the order, with
the genera found in North America. It occupies 221 pages, and is
illustrated by two plates. The second part is occupied with a mono-
graph of the American Dolichopodide. For a large portion of the
materials on which both parts of this work are based the Institution
is indebted to the liberal assistance of Baron Osten Sacken, though
some interesting species were communicated to Mr. Loew by Mr.
Le Baron, of Illinois, and by Professor Macklin, of Helsingfors, col-
lected by Mr. Sahlberg. The types of a collection were also lent to
him by the directors of the Hof Naturalien Kabinet, of Vienna.

Although the materials placed at the disposal of the author were
large, they did not reach the extent desired for the preparation of a
complete monograph. The hope is, therefore, expressed that ad-
ditional collections will be made to complete the work, and for this
purpose the request is earnestly urged on all North American col-
lectors who take an interest in this order of insects, to favor the
enterprise by sending specimens to the Institution, which may be
transmitted to Dr. Loew.

The fauna of North American Dolichopodide far exceeds the
European in the variety of forms and in the number of species.
A striking circemstance connected with this class of insects as found
in North America is their remarkable analogy to the remains of the
fossil fauna of the same family preserved in amber. In both there
is the same abundance of species of a particular genus, difficult to
distinguish on account of their close resemblance. It would appear
from this, that if there is a gradual variation of species under varying
conditions of existence, this variation has been less in regard to
American insects of this class than in those of Europe. It is import-
ant in the progress of science not ouly to trace the limits of different
faunas, but to compare those of a similar class in different countries.
At present, however, this cannot be done with any degree of pre-
cision, except in the case of the American and European insect
fauna. In this case it is distinctly perceived that the two approach
each other in the species of several genera, while in others the
species are identical, and again those which are identical in both are
very unequally represented in the two countries. Of the species
common to Hurope and North America, it is not improbable that
some of them should have been accidentally imported in ships from
the former. a

The second part, including the supplement, consists of 371 pages,
and is illustrated by five plates.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

_ Two other works of the same series were completed, and would
have been immediately published had the manuscripts not been de-
stroyed by the fire. The first of these was a monograph of the
Myriapoda, by Dr. H. C. Wood, and the other a monograph on the
Limnobina, by Baron Osten Sacken.

Reports.—The annual reports to Congress are printed at the expense
of the government as public documents, with the exception of the
wood-cuts, which are furnished by the Institution; and it is gratifying
to be able to state that for a number of years there has not been a
dissenting vote in Congress on the adoption of the order to print the
usual number of ten thousand extra copies of this work. The manu-
script of the report for 1863 was unfortunately mislaid at the Capitol,
and the public printer was therefore obliged to delay the publication
on account of other more pressing demands of the departments of the
government. Itis much to be regretted that at the recent fire at
the Institution all the copies of the reports on hand for general
distribution to individuals were destroyed, so that at present it
will be impossible to supply the many applications which are made
_ for copies of the back volumes of the series. The reports for 1861
and 1862 were stereotyped, and when the cost of press-work and
paper is reduced to its normal state, a new edition of these may be
struck off and disposed of at the mere price of production.

The report for 1863 contains in the appendix a course of lectures
on the principles of linguistic science, by Professor W. D. Whitney,
of Yale College; a eulogy of Beautemps-Beaupre, translated by C. A.
Alexander, esq., a continuation of the series of memoirs of distin-
guished members of the French Academy of Sciences; an account of
the origin and history of the Royal Society of London, prepared by
the same; an exposition of the modern theory of chemical types,
by Dr. Charles M. Wetherill; an original article on the method of
preserving Lepidoptera, with illustrations, by Titian R. Peale, esq.;
an account of a remarkable accumulation of bats at the residence, in
Maryland, of M. Figaniere, Portuguese minister; a number of articles
on ethnology, giving an account of ancient remains in various parts
of America and Europe. There are also a number of translations
made expressly for the Institution, viz: researches on the phenomena
which accompanied the propagation of electricity in highly rarefied
elastic fluids, by Professor de la Rive; report on the proceedings of
the Society of Physics and Natural History of Geneva, by Professor
Marcet; the commencement of Plateau’s researches on the figures of

equilibrium of a liquid mass withdrawn from the action of gravity;
an account of the history of discovery relative to magnetism; recent
researches relative to the nebule, by Professor Gautier; an article
from the annals of the Observatory at Madrid, by Miguel Merino, on
the investigations made to determine the form and volume of the
earth; Arago’s account of aeronautic voyages performed with a view
to the advancement of science, to which is added from an English
publication Mr. Glaisher’s account of his recent ascensions in Eng-
land; the first part of an interesting and valuable account of the ab-
original inhabitants of the Californian peninsula, by Baegert, a Jesuit
missionary who lived there seventeen years during the second half
of the last century; and an article from a German scientific periodical
on purple and azure dyeing in ancient and modern times. At the end
of the volume a few of the more important tables of weights and
measures, especially needed for reference in some of the preceding
articles, have been added.

Ethnology.—The publications of the Institution relative to eth-
nology during the past year are those given in the appendix to the
last report, the most important of which isa translation by Professor
Rau, of an account of the aboriginal inhabitants of the Californian
peninsula, by Baegert, a German Jesuit missionary. The book from
which this translation was made was published in Germany in 1773,
and is now very scarce and almost unknown in this country. It will be
considered, we doubt not, at this time, an interesting contribution to
the ethnology as wellas the early history of a part of the world which
has of late years occupied so much of the public attention. Mr. Rau
has not given a translation in the strict sense of the word, but a re-
production of the work only so far as it relates to ethnological matters,
his object being to rescue from oblivion facts relating to the history
of a portion of the American race. The second part of this work will
be published in the appendix to the present report.

There is a growing taste for the study of ethnology in this country,
and consequently a desire to form collections illustrating the condition
of the American aborigines in different parts of the continent. In
order to encourage this tendency, and to bring together for critical
study and comparison the scattered specimens which exist in this
country, the Institution has requested, either as a gift or a loan,
specimens of the arts and other remains found in mounds, excavations,
or on the surface of the ground; and with the assistance of Professor
Matile, formerly of the University of Neufchatel, commenced in 1863
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

the preparation of a series of moulds from which casts are made for
distribution and exchange. In carrying on this work we have been
favored with a large collection of specimens of Mexican art, principally
images and masks, by the American Philosophical Society, of Phila-
delphia, from which moulds have been taken. The prosecution of
this work has been temporarily suspended, but will be resumed as soon
as facilities and means for its prosecution can be provided. In this
connexion we would renew the request which we have made in pre-
vious reports, that descriptions of all mounds or aboriginal earthworks
which may be discovered may be sent to the Institution for the pur-
pose of furnishing the materials for a work at some future time on the
distribution and migration of the ancient inhabitants of this continent.
In order to preserve and render generally accessible the information
which may be obtained in this way, it will be published in the ap-
pendix to the next succeeding annual report after its reception.

Meteorology.—It has been mentioned in previous reports that the
second volume of the results of meteorological observations made under
the direction of the Smithsonian Institution and the Patent Office, from
the year 1854 to 1859, was in press, and that its completion was de-
layed by the unusual amount of printing required by the necessities
of the public service to be executed at the Government Printing
Office. It was thought best, therefore, to issue the portion already
printed, without waiting longer for the other material which it had
been intended to embrace in the volume. This portion, forming a
quarto volume of more than five hundred pages, was consequently
bound and distributed during the past year. It is divided into two
parts, each occupying about half the volume. The first relates to
the periodical phenomena of plants and animals from 1851 to 1859,
inclusive, embracing observations upon the foliation of eighty-seven
species, the blossoming of ninety-two, the ripening :of fruit of ten,
and the defoliation of eighteen species of plants, and upon the first
appearance of sixteen species of birds, one of reptiles, three of fishes,
and two of insects. These results have a direct application to me-
teorological science, by indicating the progress of the seasons in dif-
ferent localities, and their relative variability in different years. To
these have been added several tables of the opening and closing of
lakes, rivers, canals, and harbors, collected from various sources,
and tending to illustrate the same leading features of climate as the
records of organic phenomena. The materials were furnished chiefly
by the regular Smithsonian observers, and were arranged and pre-

pared for publication by Dr. Franklin B. Hough, of Albany, N. Y.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The latter half of the volume is occupied with materials for the
critical study of three storms in 1859, one of which occurred in March
and the other two in September, collected from the records of the In-
stitution, and prepared for publication by Professor J. H. Coffin, of
Lafayette College, Easton, Pennsylvania. One of the important ob-
jects aimed at in establishing the meteorological observations of the
Smithsonian Institution was the collection of data for the critical ex-
amination of the development and progress of the extended commo-
tions of the atmosphere which occur during the autumn, winter, and
spring, over the middle or temperate portions of North America. It
is well known that two hypotheses as to the direction and progress
of the wind in these storms have been advocated with an exhibition
of feeling unusual in the discussion of a problem of a purely scien-
tific character, and which, with sufficient available data, is readily
susceptible of a definite solution. According to one hypothesis the
motion of the air in these storms is gyratory; according to the other it
is in right lines toward a central point, or toward an irregular elon-
gated middle space. It is hoped that the data here given will be
considered of importance in settling, at least approximately, these
questions as to the general pheromena of American storms.

These two quarto volumes of meteorological results for the six
years 1854 to 1859 inclusive, embracing nearly two thousand pages,
together with a volume covering very nearly the same period of time
published by the War Department, probably form an unsurpassed
body of materials for the investigation of meteorological phenomena
over so wide an extent of country. The tables of the War Depart-
ment embrace nearly two hundred quarto pages of reductions for five
years, 1855 to 1859, inclusive, and form an appendix to the ‘‘statis-
tical report on the sickness and mortality in the army of the United
States,’’? published in 1860, compiled by Assistant Surgeon R. H.
Coolidge, under the direction of Dr. Lawson, Surgeon General United
States army. The original records, both in the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and War Department, from which the results contained in these
three volumes were deduced, are open to the examination of persons
who wish to make investigations more minute, or of a more extended
nature than can be embraced in general tables.

It is regretted that we have not the means at present of continuing
the reduction of all the records as received from the observers, and
of publishing the results. This want, however, is supplied to a
limited extent by the publication of the reductions of temperature and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

rain in the monthly report on the state of the crops and the weather,
issued by the Agricultural Department, between which and this In-
stitution the relations mentioned in the last report have been main-
tained through the past year. To save postage, the blank forms
have been sent out and the registers returned through the frank of
the office of the Commissioner of Agriculture. The monthly bulletin
above referred to, which is printed at the expense of the same de-
partment, continues to be received by the public with much favor ;
and, by means of its extensive distribution, presents the meteorolo-
gical tables to a much larger circle of readers than is comprised in
the list of our observers, awakening, to a corresponding extent, an
interest in the subject of meteorology. This branch of science is
receiving increased attention from year to year, and a larger number
of individuals are devoting time and talent to efforts for unfolding
the laws which control the formation and movement of vapor, winds,
and change of temperature in all parts of the world. Meteorology
has ceased to be a mere record of isolated facts. The special
characteristic of modern efforts in this line consists in extended co-
operation, and in determining the simultaneous condition of the
atmosphere over extended regions of country. It is only by this
means that the laws which govern the occurrence, motion, direction,
and propagation of the disturbances of the atmosphere can be ascer-
tained. By comparisons of this kind isolated observations of other-
‘wise little value become important, and afford an ample field in the
cultivation of which any person who will take the trouble to record
the direction of the wind, the beginning and ending of rain, snow,
hail, the time of blossoming of trees, appearance of birds, insects,
&c., may render valuable service.

The daily record of meteorological observations telegraphed to the
Imperial Observatory at Paris, and published in a lithographed sheet,
continues to increase in interest and importance under the active
and enlightened superintendence of M. Le Verrier, director of the
observatory. From being the medium simply for the circulation of
telegraphic notices of the weather, it has become, in addition, a
repository of valuable meteorological summaries, communications,
criticisms, and announcements. The outline chart of Europe, with
the curves of equal barometric pressure and direction of the wind at
the different stations on the day of publication, and also a table of
the estimated weather for the following day, continue to be inserted
inevery number. The title of the publication is now ‘‘ International
Bulletin of the Imperial Observatory of Paris.’’ It occupies more than
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

twelve hundred folio pages yearly, at a subscription price of thirty-six
francs.

The Institution has also received a similar meteorological bulletin
from the Royal Observatory at Palermo. In the first number of this,
a plan is proposed for distributing simultaneous meteorological obser-
vations similar to that which was adopted previous to the war by the
Smithsonian Institution, viz: that of furnishing the most important
telegraphic stations with meteorological instruments, and instructing
the principal telegraphist, or one of his assistants, in the process of
making observations. A thoroughly organized system of this kind
over the whole United States, with a series of directions for predict-
ing the weather at a given place from a knowledge of the condition
of the atmosphere at distant points, would be of vast importance to
the maritime and agricultural interests, particularly along the Atlan-
tic sea-board. It is hoped that as soon as order is restored and peace
fully re-established throughout the southern portion of the United
States, the system will be revived under still more favorable auspices.

An important addition to the means at the command of the Insti-
tution for this purpose has been furnished by the liberal action of
the North American Telegraphic Association, in giving the free use
of all its lines for the scientific objects of the Institution. The asso-
ciation embraces the Western Union, the American, the Montreal,
the Southwestern, and the Illinois and Mississippi Telegraph Com-
panies, covering the entire United States and Canada, including the
overland line to San Francisco, which, by its charter, is required to
transmit without charge scientific despatches for the Institution.
The telegraph companies on the Pacific coast have also liberally
granted the same privileges.

I am happy to state in this connexion that efforts have been made
to revive and complete the meteorological observations which were
collected by the Naval or National Observatory. The records from
the log-books of the commercial and naval marine collected under
the direction of the former superintendent, though imperfectly, and
in many cases erroneously interpreted, were valuable contributions
to the materials from which the true theory of the general motions
of the atmosphere are to be deduced.

The lake system of meteorology is still kept up under the new
superintendent, Col. Raynolds, though the Institution has not re-
ceived the copies of the registers for the past year.

The State Department has furnished the Institution with several
meteorological contributions forwarded to it by consuls in foreign
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

countries. Among them are observations made at Constantinople
for the year ending September, 1863; daily telegraphic reports of
the weather in Europe, communicated to the Central Physical Ob-
servatory at St. Petersburg, Russia, for the year ending September,
1864, translated and compiled by Mr. Edwin Phelps, United States
consul; meteorological review for the year 1864, from observations
at the Leprosy hospital of Lungeguard in the city of Bergen, Norway,
reduced by O. H. Dreutzer, United States consul; monthly tables
for a part of the year 1864, from the consul at Turk’s Island, West
Indies. If all the American consuls in foreign countries would
collect and send to the State Department local publications contain-
ing meteorological tables, many valuable additions might be furnished.

The Navy Department, as heretofore, has transmitted to the Insti-
tution monthly reports kept at the naval hospitals at Chelsea, New
York, and Philadelphia.

A circular and a chart of stars prepared by the Connecticut
Academy of Arts and Sciences was published by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and distributed to its observers for the purpose of obtaining
records of the meteors that might appear on the night of November
13-14, 1864, but the general cloudiness of the night prevented the
attainment of any valuable results.

The three rooms in which the meteorological records were kept
were destroyed by the fire on the 24th of January, 1865. Owing to
the great rapidity with which the fire progressed much valuable ma-
terial was lost, but fortunately the larger portion of the contents of
the rooms were saved. Among the articles lost were the principal
instruments used at the Institution for meteorological observations,
including the self-registering apparatus for recording the direction
and velocity of the wind, constructed by Dr. Smallwood, of Montreal,
and partially described in the Smithsonian reports for 1856 and 1860.
It had been in operation since 1858. All the records kept by it were
lost. As soon as a minute investigation can be made as to the miss-
ing sheets of the general records, a list of deficiencies will be
published, and it is hoped that a portion at least of these may be
restored by copies of the duplicates retained by the observers.

Laboratory—During the past year the laboratory has been in
charge of Dr. Charles M. Wetherill. The experiments mentioned in
the last report on materials for light-house illumination have been
continued, and a series of examinations has been made of different
substances submitted for that purpose by the government. The most
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

extended series of experiments, however, has been that which relates
to the condition of the air, and the mode of ventilation of the United
States Capitol. This subject was referred by Mr. Thomas U. Walter,

the architect of the Capitol, to the Secretary of this Institution.

The plan of the investigation having been determined, the experi-
ments have principally been made by Dr, Wetherill. The result of
this investigation, it is believed, will not only throw additional light
on the points for which it was instituted, but also form an interesting
addition to the subject of ventilation. The work in the laboratory,

also by Dr. Wetherill, comprised various researches upon subjects of
chemical science. Of these, three, viz.: ‘‘On the nature of the so-

called ammonium amalgam;’’ “On the crystallization of sulphur;’’ and
‘¢QOn the crystalline nature of glass,’’ will be published shortly in one

of the scientific journals of the country. The means for carrying on
physical research at the Institution have been materially diminished,

on account of the destruction by fire of the very valuable collection
of physical apparatus. Fortunately the conflagration did not extend
to the laboratory, and consequently the chemical apparatus was pre-
served.

Collections of specimens of natural history, &c.—The work of making
collections of specimens of natural history has been prosecuted as in
previous years. A very large collection of mammals, birds, eggs,
&c., made in the northern part of British America in 1863, princi-
pally by the officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company, has arrived at
Fort Garry, and is expected soon to be received in Washington.
Collections have also been received from Labrador, Puget’s sound,
and from various parts of the United States, Central America,
Mexico, and the West Indies, a detailed account of which is given in
the annexed report of Professor Baird. Advantage has been taken
of every exploring expedition which has been sent out by govern-
ment, and in many cases of the assistance offered by officers of the
army, particularly of the medical department, for adding new mate-
rials or duplicate specimens to the collections. The great object, as
has been frequently stated before, of this work, is to obtain the ma-
terials for an extended knowledge of the natural history of this con-
tinent, and to furnish ‘illustrations of type specimens to museums,
colleges, and other educational establishments.

The whole number of specimens catalogued during the last twelve
years is upwards of 100,000, and including duplicates, the whole
number collected will amount to five times that amount.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

The distribution of duplicates has been continued as rapidly as the
identification and labelling could be accomplished. In this distribu-
-tion regard has been had to the relative geographical positions of the
establishments to which the first sets of specimens have been sent as
well as to their importance as influential centres of higher education.
According to the statement of Professor Baird, it will be seen that
already upwards of 16,000 specimens have been distributed during
the year, and efforts will be made during the season to increase this
number. The importance of this branch of operations depends more
upon what the Institution is enabled to distribute than on what it
accumulates for permanent preservation.

Museum.—The type specimens of the museum have been gradually
increased during the past year, not only from the collections made
by the Institution, but also from donations received from abroad, par-
ticularly as regards rare birds, eggs, fossils, andanimals. The Euro-
pean specimens of ornithology were requested for the purpose of
enabling Professor Baird by comparison to prosecute his work on
American birds.

Previous to the fire the large room partly occupied by the Stanley
collection of Indian portraits had been fitted up with about two hun-
dred feet of cases around the walls, to receive the ethnological speci-
mens in possession of the Institution. While engaged in re-arranging
the pictures above these cases, the workmen, with a view to their own
comfort, unfortunately placed the pipe of a stove in a ventilating flue
which opened under the roof, and thus caused the conflagration which
destroyed the upper part of the main building. Fortunately none
of the ethnological articles had been placed in this room, and conse-
quently these specimens, with those of the museum and of the general
collections, have been preserved.

Exchanges. —The system of international literary and scientific ex-
changes has been continued during the past year with unabated
energy, and on the part of the Institution exclusively, several hun-
dred sets of its publications, each embracing 1,782 pages, have been
sent to foreign institutions.

According to the tabular statement given by Professor Baird it ap-
pears that, during the year 1864, there have been despatched to
foreign countries 1,011 packages, each containing a number of articles,
enclosed in sixty-three boxes, measuring 546 cubic feet and weighing
20,500 pounds. The number of packages received in return for
societies and individuals in this country was 2,482 (nearly twice as
many as in 1863) exclusive of those for the Smithsonian library.
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Inbrary.—The library has continued to increase, principally by
the addition of all the current transactions of societies and of scientific
journals. By exchanges there have been received 645 octavo, 153.
quarto, and 25 folio volumes, 2,754 pamphlets and parts of volumes,
and 109 maps and charts—total 3,686. In the appendix to this report
will be found a list of the foreign societies and individuals which have
made donations to the library of the Institution, with the number of
works received from 1860 to 1864.

Lectures. —Up to the occurrence of the fire no lectures had been
given this season; indeed, on account of the increased expenditures
incident to the advance of prices, it was thought advisable to diminish
the number of lectures, since this part of the operations of the estab-
lishment has not been considered of so much importance as other sec-
tions of the general plan of organization. It can scarcely be doubted
that the publication in the late annual reports of synopses of the
lectures has been of more service in the diffusion of knowledge than
their delivery in the hall of the Institution, and that their place may,
with equal advantage, be supplied by occasional and popular exposi-
tions of certain subjects in a similar form.

The foregoing is the substance of what was intended for presenta-
tion to the Board of Regents as an exposition of the staté of the In-
stitution at the close of 1864, and of what had been,accomplished
during that year in the way of carrying out the programme of organi-
zation. On account of the burning of the original draft of the report,
and of a large portion of the records of the establishment, the state-
ments are not as full in some particulars as they would have been
had they been prepared under more favorable circumstances, but the
deficiencies in this respect can be made up in the report for next
year.

The danger from fire at the Institution has been to me, from the
commencement of the occupancy of the building, a source of constant
and anxious solicitude. The combustible character of the two wings,
of the two connecting ranges, and of the interior of the towers,
together with the plan of heating originally adopted, rendered an
accident by fire far from improbable, and led me to enforce a system
of vigilance, the strict observance of which I hoped would insure
safety. The flame, however, was communicated at a point where
danger was least suspected, and through one of those contingencies
against which all circumspection is unavailing,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

But, although greatly to be regretted on account of the losses in-
curred, the accident is not without compensation in considerations of
a different nature ; thus, it has served to call forth the expression of
a large amount of kind feeling in regard to the Institution, to direct
the attention of Congress to the character and importance of its opera-
tions, and has thus, perhaps, furnished the opportunity of remedying
some of the defects in the original law of its organization, which were
the result of the novelty of the enterprise or the desire of reconciling
inconsistent propositions. Immediately after the fire, as is well
known to the Board, a committee of the two houses of Congress was
appointed to inquire into its origin, the loss sustained, the means
necessary to repair the building, and to collect such facts in connex-
ion with the whole subject as might be of public interest. This
committee, after adopting the report of the special committee of the
Board* as to the origin of the fire, called upon the Secretary for a
detailed statement of the origin and objects of the Institution and of
its operations from the beginning, in connexion with the policy of
the Regents and his own superintendence of its affairs.

In pursuance of this request I submitted to the committee a gen-
eral review of the more prominent facts connected with the adoption
of the plan of organization, and of what has been since accomplished
towards realizing the views of the founder and the wishes of the
friends of the Institution. Although this review may give facts
familiar to some of the members of the Board and to those who
have directed any special attention to the history of the estab-
lishment, it may weil be inferred from occasional remarks, not only
in the journals of the day, but on the floor of Congress, that there
is no little need of the repetition of statements tending to correct
misconceptions which arise, no doubt, much oftener from inattention
than from prejudice. It is for this reason, and to keep before the
public mind distinct ideas of the character and operations of the In-
stitution, that I append, as the concluding portion of this report, the
statement, somewhat expanded in the introduction, which I had the
honor of laying before the Joint Committee of Congress.

SKETCH OF THE ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF THE INSTITUTION.

The founder of this Institution, James Smithson, was a graduate of
the University of Oxford, devoted during a long life to the advance-
ment of science, and the author of a number of original contributions
to geology, chemistry, mineralogy, &c. He was well acquainted with

* See proceedings of the Board.

358
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

original research in the various branches of knowledge, and had doubt-
less a proper appreciation of the good which might be effected by
founding an institution especially adapted to advance this object.
He accordingly intrusted his property to the United States to found
an establishment ‘‘ under the name of the Smithsonian Institution for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.’’ He evidently did not
intend by these precise terms to found a library or a mere museum
for the diffusion of popular information to a limited community, but
a cosmopolitan establishment. to increase the swm of human knowledge
and to diffuse this to every part of the civilized world. No other
interpretation of the will is either in accordance with the terms em-
ployed or with the character and habits of the founder. The in-
crease of human knowledge, by which we must understand additions
to its sum, would be of but little value without its diffusion, and to
limit the latter to one city, or even to one country, would be an in-
vidious restriction of the term men. These views, so evident to
minds especially devoted to science, were not at once apparent to
those whose studies and pursuits had been chiefly confined to litera-
ture or public affairs. The first scheme which was presented in re-
gard to the character of the future institution proposed that it should
assume the form of a university, but this idea was shown to be er-
roneous by the Hon. J. Q. Adams, who pointed out the fact that the
object of a university was not to increase knowledge, but to diffuse
that which already exists. The next proposition, which had many
advocates, was that of a large library or museum; but these objects
are in a measure local in their influence and tend, like the former, to
promote rather the diffusion than the increase of knowledge.

From this diversity of opinion as to the character of the proposed
Institution, or from whatever other causes, the bequest was suffered
to remain inoperative for eight years. It was not until 1846 that
Congress passed the act of organization under which the Institution
has since continued in operation.

This act directs that provision be made for a library, museum, and
gallery of art, in a suitable building of plain and durable materials, and
after these and some other general indications of the views of the
legislature, leaves it discretionary with the Board of Regents to
adopt such further measures for promoting the common purpose as
might seem, in their judgment, best to comport with the terms of the
donation.

I may be permitted to state, without giving undue prominence to
my own part in the organization, that immediately after the passage
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

of this act Iwas requested by one of the Regents to prepare a sketch
of such an institution as I deemed that of Smithson ought to be, with
reference at once to the requirements of Congress, and the brief,
though comprehensive, phrases of the will. After devoting careful
attention to the expressions of the bequest, and being acquainted
with the character of the founder, I could not entertain the slightest
doubt that it was the intention of the latter to establish a cosmopel-
itan institution, which should be alike a monument of his own
fervent love of science, an efficient instrumentality for promoting
original researches and rendering a knowledge of their results
accessible to inquiring minds in every part and age of the world.
I accordingly advised the adoption of the plan set forth in the first
section of the programme presented to the board in my report for
1847,* a plan which is principally designed to increase knowledge
by instituting researches and assisting in various ways men of talents
and acquirements to make original investigations in all departments
of scientific inquiry, as well as to diffuse the knowledge thus obtained
by presenting, free of cost, to all the principal libraries and public
institutions of the world copies of a series of volumes containing the
results of the investigations instituted.

Previous to the presentation of these views, one of the Regents
had reported in favor of making immediate provision for a library, a
museum, a gallery of art, and other local objects, in connexion with
a system of lectures to be delivered in different parts of the country;
while another Regent had presented an eloquent appeal in favor of a
great library composed of books in all languages and on all subjects.

In reviewing these and other plans of organization which had been
previously advocated, it will scarcely be denied by an unprejudiced
mind that, for the most part, they were such as to exert a merely local
influence, and which, if they embraced means for the diffusion of
popular knowldge, neglected the first and essential condition of the
bequest, viz.: the increase of knowledge—in other words, the advance-
ment of science or the discovery and promulgation of new truths.
On the other hand, the plan of organization presented in the first
section of the report for 1847 is that of a living, active, progressive
system, limited in its operations only by the amount of the income;
calculated to affect the condition of man wherever literature and sci-
ence are cultivated, while it tends in this country to give an impulse to
original thought, which, amidst the strife of politics and the inordi-

nate pursuit of wealth, is, of all things, most desirable.

* See programme of organization, page 8 of this report.
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

These views, which have commanded the approval of unprejudiced
and reflecting persons generally, and especially of men of science, to
which class Smithson belonged, were fully shared from the first by
Professor Bache, General Totten, Gideon Hawley, esq., and in whole
or in part by other members of the board, and I was elected the
secretary or principal executive officer, to develop and carry into
practice, as I supposed, under the direction of the board, the plan I
had suggested.

The appointment was accepted with much and not causeless solici-
tude as to the result. I soon found that although a number of the
members of the board were in favor of the promotion of original
researches, or of what has since, by way of discrimination, been
called the active operations, neither a majority of the Regents nor
perhaps the community in general was prepared to favor a plan of
organization which should exclude the material representation of the
Institution in the form of an extensive architectural structure calcu-
lated to arrest the eye and embellish the national capital.

It was in vain tourge the fact that alarge and expensive building was
not only unnecessary to the realization of the purpose of Smithson, but
that it would tend to defeat that object by absorbing the income, con-
trolling the future policy of the Institution, and confining its influence
principally to a single locality; that it was not the estimated first cost
of the edifice which should alone be considered, but also the expense
of keeping it in repair and the maintenance of the corps of assistants
and employés which would be required in an establishment of this
kind; that the increase of the collections of a miscellaneous library and
public museum would, in time, require additional space; and that,
finally, all the revenue of the bequest would be absorbed in a statical
establishment, or in attempting to do that which can only be properly
accomplished, as in other countries, by means of the government.
Unfortunately the building committee had settled upon a design for
the building in the Lombard style, and Congress had presented to the
Institution the museum of the exploring expedition, then at the Patent
Office, and directed that provision should be made on a liberal scale for
its accommodation, neglecting, at the same time, to fill the blank in
the act of organization, by which the cost of the building was to have
been limited. It was this provision of the law which furnished a
fulcrum for the influence exerted by the citizens of Washington, and
persons pecuniarily interested, directly or indirectly, in contracts or
otherwise, in favor of the erection of the present structuse. Thus
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

re-enforced, the fascination of its architectural display as presented
on paper proved too strong to be resisted.

The adoption of this extensive and costly building was considered
so inauspicious a beginning that I had resolved to resign the office of
director, and make no further attempt to introduce the plan witha
view to the success of which I had accepted the position, when a
temporary compromise was proposed by which the several plans
might be brought to the test of experience, and an opportunity ap-
parently given for any modifications which might be found advisable.

In order to meet the large expenditure on the building, to provide
for the support of the establishment necessarily connected with it,
and to leave the greater part of the interest of the original bequest
free to be applied to its more legitimate objects, it was resolved to
create an extra fund, while gradually developing the plans of organi-
zation, and for this purpose the following course was adopted:

1. The building to be erected in parts, and its different portions
gradually brought into requisition, its completion being thus delayed
for a number of years.

2. The sum appropriated to the building, furniture, and grounds,
viz., $250,000, being mainly the interest which had accrued previous
to the organization, to be invested in United States treasury stock,
bearing interest.

3. The plan of organization to be gradually developed, and, instead
of expending upon it from the first the whole interest of the original
bequest, a part of this to be also invested in treasury bonds.

4, The remainder of the income to be divided between the active
operations on the one hand and the library and museum on the other.
The latter to be restricted principally to scientific books and to
type specimens.

This compromise was adopted, and has been so successfully and
steadily carried out financially, that at the commencement of the
war, after paying for the building, accumulating a very valuable
library, establishing and supporting a large museum, and carry-
ing on all the active operations of the establishment, an extra fund
had been created amounting to $140,000. In order to secure this
from the contingencies of any future expenditure on buildings or
loss from hazardous investment, a petition was preferred to Con-
gress to take it from the care of the Regents and deposit it with
the original principal in the treasury of the United States, sub-
ject to the same restriction, viz., that the interest alone could be
expended. This petition not having been acted upon, the Regents

This scheme has afforded an ample opportunity to compare the
relative advantages of the two principal plans of organization and to
verify the predictions which were originally made in regard to the
building. Though but a portion of the income has been devoted to
the active operations, they have produced results in the way of in-
creasing and diffusing knowledge abundantly sufficient to justify the
anticipations which were entertained in regard to them, and to con-
vince the most skeptical of their primary importance. As to the
building, it is now abundantly proved that a structure of one-fifth of
the cost would have been sufficient for the wants of the Institution,
and that two grave errors were committed in the adoption of the pres.
ent one: first, the plan was but little adapted to the uses to which the
edifice was to be applied ; second, the style of architecture required a
far greater expenditure than the amount to which the cost of the
building was limited. For the purpose of architectural effect the
interior was very inconveniently divided; the buttresses, turrets, and
towers, while they add very little to the accommodation of the build-
ing, greatly increased the cost. To have constructed the building
in a substantial and durable manner, in strict conformity with the
Lombard style of architecture which was adopted, would have re-
quired an expenditure of at least double the amount of the sum
appropriated for the purpose. It was, therefore, necessary, in order
that the exterior might be constructed in freestone, that the interior
should be finished in wood and stucco, and that thus recourse
should be had to the presentation of a falsehood to the eye in the
very inauguration of an enterprise for the advancement of truth.
The two wings and the two connecting ranges were completed in
this manner. The main building, which is 200 feet long and 50 wide,
embellished with six towers, was also in process of completion, the
framing of the interior having been finished, when the underpinning
gave way and the whole of the woodwork fell to the ground. After
the occurrence of this accident a commission of architects, appointed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39
to examine the building, reported that the exterior walls were well
built, both in regard to construction and materials, but that the plan
of finishing the interior in wood and stucco was improper for an edifice
intended to contain valuable articles; it was therefore recommended
that fire-proof materials should be employed for the portions of the
work which remained to be constructed. In conformity with this
recommendation the interior of the main building was completed in
iron, stone, and brick, with the exception of the roof, which, being
covered with slate and not supposed to be exposed to danger from
fire, was suffered to remain. It was this change, in the mode of con-
structing a portion of the edifice, which, during the late fire, saved
the contents of the whole from destruction. It, however, increased
the cost of the building to upwards of $300,000, leaving the remain-
ing parts of the interior of the structure in perishable materials.

It was hoped that, through the adoption of the compromise propo-
sitions, the importance of the active operations would speedily
become apparent, and that the plan of erecting an expensive
building would be abandoned before more than one of the wings
had been completed; but, though the construction of the edifice
was, in accordance with the agreement, extended over a number of
years, yet in anticipation of such an interference with its ultimate
completion, so large a portion of the lower story of the whole struc-
ture was commenced in the first two years that it was apparent no
successful opposition could be made to its further progress. Nor
can Congress be absolved of the charge of having indirectly con-
tributed to encumber the bequest with the cost and maintenance of
so extensive a building and so numerous a retinue: with more
justice, therefore, may it be invoked to relieve the Institution,.in
due time, from the burden imposed upon it. It should, however, be
remembered, on the other hand, that by repeated enactments Con-
gress has sanctioned the prominence which has been given to the
active operations, and acquiesced in the adoption of the special
character which has been impressed on the library and museum. It
has relieved the Institution from the care of the grounds, also of
the copyright books which were intended to swell the number of
volumes, and, so far from still considering the museum of the ex-
ploring expedition a desirable gift, it has granted for several years
past four thousand dollars annually to assist in bearing the expenses
of preserving and exhibiting the specimens.

It is to be regretted that Congress directed that provision should be
made on a large scale for a library and museum, since each tends to
cripple the other, and the whole to diminish the efficiency of the active
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

operations. A conscientious endeavor, however, has been made to
harmonize the whole scheme, by establishing a special library, con-
sisting of the transactions of learned societies and systematic works on
all branches of science, together with a limited museum of type speci-
mens, principally of the products of the American continent. And,
on the whole, it may be pronounced that, notwithstanding the inaus-
picious circumstances which attended the commencement of the In-
stitution, as before stated, and the difficulties with which it has’ had
to contend from time to time, the results it has produced have been
such as to commend it to the public generally throughout our own
country, and to make it favorably known to the cultivators of science
wherever found. It has identified itself with the history of almost
every branch of knowledge which receives attention at the present
day, and its transactions and proceedings are constantly referred to
as authoritative on all subjects to which they pertain. With no desire
to exaggerate its importance or advantages, the fact may be satisfac-
torily cited that the recognition of its services in behalf of science
exists in the contemporary works of all languages, that its publications
are found wherever letters are cultivated, and its specimens in all
the principal museums of the world. If it was the desire of the
founder to perpetuate the memory of his liberality, that desire has
been thus fully gratified; nor is the memorial of his enlightened and
comprehensive benevolence limited as to place or time, since it is
everywhere renewed with the yearly dissemination of the publica-
tions which bear his name.

The following brief sketch of the labors of the Institution up to the
present time will not only serve to show what it has done, but also
to illustrate the capability of the plan of active operations for pro-
ducing important results in the way of increasing and diffusing know-
ledge among men.

ACTIVE OPERATIONS.

Publications.—The Smithsonian Institution has established three
classes of publications, in which are contained the articles hereafter
to be mentioned. These are as follows:

1. A quarto series, entitled ‘‘Smithsonian Contributions to Know-
ledge,’’ issued in volumes, each embracing one or more separate
articles. Of these the fourteenth is nearly through the press.

2. An octavo series, entitled ‘‘Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions,’’ which in the aggregate make six large volumes.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

3. Another octavo series, consisting of the annual reports of the
Institution to Congress, called ‘‘ Smithsonian Reports,’’ of which
eleven volumes have been published.

The Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge include memoirs em-
bracing the records of extended original investigations and researches
resulting in what are believed to be new truths, and constituting
positive additions to the sum of human knowledge.

The series of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections contains reports
on the present state of our knowledge of particular branches of
science ; instructions for collecting and digesting facts and materials
for research ; lists and synopses of species of the organic and inor-
ganic world ; museum catalogues ; reports of explorations ; aids to
bibliographical investigations, &c,; generally prepared at the express
request of the Institution, and at its expense.

The Annual Reports include the official reports of the Secretary to
the Board of Regents of the operations and condition of the Institu-
tion ; the reports of committees of the board ; abstracts of lectures
delivered before the Institution; extracts from correspondence; origi-
nal or translated articles relating to the history and progress of
science, &c.

The following rules have been observed in the distribution of the
first and second series:

1. They are presented to all learned societies of the first class
which publish transactions, and give copies of these, in exchange,
to the Institution.

2. To all foreign libraries of the first class, provided they give in
exchange their catalogues and other publications, or an equivalent,
from their duplicate volumes.

3. To all the colleges in actual operation in this country, provided
they furnish, in return, meteorological observations, catalogues of
their libraries and of their students, and all other publications issued
by them relative to their organization and history.

4. To all States and Territories, provided they give, in return,
copies of all documents published under their authority.

5. To all incorporated public libraries in this country, not included
in any of the foregoing classes, now containing 10,000 volumes; and
to smaller libraries, where a whole State or large district would be
otherwise unsupplied.

Institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion of particular
branches of knowledge receive such articles published by the Insti-
tution as relate to their objects. Portions of the series are also given
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

to institutions of lesser grade not entitled, under the above rules, to
the full series, and also to the meteorclogical correspondents of the
Institution.

The reports are of a more popular character, and are presented—

1. To all the meteorological observers and other collaborators of the
Institution.

2. To donors to its library or museum.

3. To colleges and other educational establishments.

4. To public libraries and literary and scientific societies.

5. To teachers or individuals who are engaged in special studies,
and who make direct application for them.

Besides the works which have been published entirely at the ex-
pense of the Institution, aid has been furnished by subscription for
copies to be distributed to foreign libraries of a number of works
which fall within the class adopted by the programme. The princi-
pal works of this kind for which subscriptions have been made are as
follows : Agassiz’s Contributions to Natural History, Gould’s Astro-
nemical Journal, Shea’s American Linguistics, Runkle’s Mathematical
Monthly, Deane’s Fossil Footprints, Tuomey & Holmes’s Fossils of
South Carolina, Peirce’s Analytic Mechanics.

Meteorology.—The investigation of all questions relative to meteor-
ology has been an object to which the Institution has devoted special at-
tention, and one of its first efforts was to organize a voluntary system of
observation, which should extend as widely as possible over the whole
of the North American continent. It induced a skilful artisan, under
its direction, to commence the manufacture of carefully prepared and
accurately graduated instruments, now generally known as the Smith-
sonian standards. It prepared and furnished a series of instructions
for the use of the instruments and the observations of meteorological
phenomena ; also three series of blank forms as registers.

It next organized a body of intelligent observers, and in a compar-
atively short time brought the system into practical operation ; each
year the number of observers increased, and where one ceased his
connexion with the enterprise, several came forward to supply his
place. By an arrangement with the Surgeon General of the army,
the system of observations at the United States military posts in dif-
ferent parts of the country, and also that which had previously been
established by the State of New York, were remodelled so as to har-
monize with that of the Institution. Gentlemen interested in science,
residing in the British provinces, and at nearly all the posts of the Hud-
son’s Bay Company, also in Mexico, Central America, the West In-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

dies, and some places in South America, &c., joined in the enterprise;
and, with few exceptions, at the beginning of the war every dis-
trict of considerable size had in it at least one if not more observers.
All these contribute their services without compensation, their only
reward being the satisfaction of co-operating with each other and
the Institution in the effort to supply data and materials for investi-
gation. Any returns, indeed, which the Institution has in its power
to make are gladly rendered in a hearty acknowledgment of assist-
ance, and in copies of all the Smithsonian publications likely to be
of interest.

Besides the materials obtained directly from the observers of the
Institution, a large amount of other matter relative to the meteor-
ology of North America has been accumulated—such as copies of all
the known series of records for long periods which could be obtained;
series which have been compiled during explorations and surveys for
the government, those which have been the result of local associa-
tions, and of the system of observations established in connexion with
the survey of the great lakes, as well as of the common school system
of Canada, and many thousand notices of the weather at different
times and places, collected from newspapers and periodicals.

No other part of the world has offered such facilities for the col-
lection of meteorological data, the system extending over so large
a portion of the earth’s surface; the observers, with few exceptions,
all speaking the same’ language, and many of them being furnished
with full sets of compared standard instruments.

It is to be regretted that this system has been partially interrupted
during the war, and that the portion of the income of the Smithsonian
fund, which could be devoted to the reduction and discussion of the
material collected, has not been adequate to the labor of deducing
from so large a body of data all the valuable truths which they are
capable of affording. It has had assistance, however, from the agri-
cultural department of the Patent Office, by which the results of five
years’ observations of all the elements and a series of i isailiaiiin
for long periods have been prepared for publication.

From all the observations made up to 1860, isothermal charts were
constructed, presenting much more accurately than had ever been
done before, the distribution of temperature over the continent of
North America; a series of rain. charts, and also a large map exhibit-
ing the regions of original forest, of arable prairie and of desert in
the United States, have also been prepared.

The Institution has fully established the fact, which was previously
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

indicated in regard to storms, by the investigations of Mr. Espy and
others, in relation to the United States, namely, that all such meteoro-
logical phenomena, as variations in the pressure of the atmosphere,
sudden changes of temperature, either of unusually warm or cold
weather, thunder-storms, tornadoes, as well as storms of wind, rain,
&c., which occur within the temperate zones, travel from west to east.
The simultaneous system of observations established by the Institu-
tion furnished the means of placing this great law of meteorology in
prominent relief, and of first reducing it to practical utility.

As early as 1849 the Institution organized a system of telegraphic
despatches, by which information was received at Washington of the
condition of the weather at distant places in the southwest and north-
west, and from this, in accordance with the law before mentioned,
it was often enabled to predict, sometimes a day or two in advance,
the approach of any larger disturbances of the atmosphere. Subse-
quently the telegraphic despatches were daily exhibited at the
Institution on a map of the United States by means of a series of
movable cards of different colors, which indicated the meteorological
condition at various points, showing at a glance in what parts of the
country it might be clear or cloudy, raining or snowing; and by
arrows the existing direction of the wind. The returns were also
published in one of the evening papers. Unfortunately this enter-
prise was interrupted by the cessation of the observations in the
southwest, and by the constant use of the telegraph for the purposes
of the government.

The advantages possessed by the Smithsonian Institution for inves-
tigations of this kind will be evident, when it is recollected that a
large portion of its observers are stationed west of Washington, that
the phenomena approach it over a large extent of land, and can be
critically noted through every part of their passage eastward, while
the phenomena which are presented to the meteorologists of Hurope
traverse in reaching them a wide expanse of ocean, from which only
casual observations can be gleaned.

The publications of the Institution contain many memoirs which
have tended to advance the science of meteorology. Among these
may be mentioned the meteorological and physical tables prepared
at the expense of the Institution by Professor Guyot, and filling a
large octavo volume of the Miscellaneous Collections. No work extant
answers the same purpose with the one referred to, which has hence
become a general standard of reference, the constant demand for it

as well in Europe as America having required the printing of several
successive editions.

The results of the reductions for five years previous to 1860 have
been published in two volumes of nearly 2,000 quarto pages, con-
taining a mass of materials of great value in determining the average
temperature, fall of rain, barometrical pressure, moisture, direction
of the wind, and time of various periodical phenomena relative to
plants, animals, &c.

In addition to these large and important volumes, other works
have been published by the Institution which have had a marked
influence on the progress of meteorology. Among these may be
mentioned the works of Professor Coffin, on the winds of the northern
hemisphere; of Mr. Chappelsmith, on a tornado in Illinois; of Professor
Loomis, on a great storm which pervaded both America and Europe;
the reduced observations for twenty-eight years of Professor Caswell,
at Providence, Rhode Island; of Dr. Smith, for twenty years in
Arkansas; of Dr. Kane and Captain McClintock, in the arctic seas;
on the heat and light of the sun at different points, by Mr. Meech;
on the secular period of the aurora, by Professor Olmsted; the
occurrence of auroras in the arctic regions, by Mr. P. Force, &c.

Besides these, a series of meteorological essays embodying many of
the results obtained from the investigations at the Institution has
been prepared by the Secretary, and been published in the agricul-
tural reports of the Patent Office.

Astronomy.—The Institution has advanced the science of astronomy
both by its publications and the assistance rendered to observers.
To facilitate astronomical observations, it prepared and published for
Six years an annual list of occultations of the principal stars by the
moon, and printed and distributed a series of tables for determining
the perturbations of the planetary motions, the object of which de-
termination is to facilitate the calculation of the places of the heavenly
bodies. These tables have accomplished the desired end, saving to
the practical astronomer an immense amount of tedious and monoto-
nous labor.

The name of the Institution has been favorably connected with the
history of the interesting discovery of the planet Neptune. Froma
few of the first observations which had been made on this planet Mr.
Sears C. Walker calculated its approximate orbit, and by this means
tracing its path through its whole revolution of 166 years he was en-
abled to carry it backward until it fell among a cluster of stars, ace
curately mapped by Lalande, towards the close of the last century.
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

After minute inspection he was led to conclude that one of the stars
which had been observed by Lalande in 1795 was the planet Nep-
tune. He was thus supplied with the amount of its motion for up-
wards of fifty years, from which he deduced a much more perfect
orbit, and was enabled to construct an ephemeris giving the place of
the planet for several years in succession. These investigations, so
interesting to astronomy and honorable to this country, were prose-
cuted and published at the expense of the Institution, the name of
which will be further connected with the planet Neptune by the pub-
lication, now in press, of a new discussion of all the observations which
have been made on this body for the last fifteen years. This work,
which is by Professor Newcomb, of the United States navy, will
furnish not only the means of determining the exact position of Nep-
tune for years to come, but also the data for ascertaining whether it
is affected by other bodies than those now known to astronomers.

To render more generally accessible to practical astronomers in
this country the theory of the motion of the heavenly bodies hy the
celebrated Gauss, the Institution shared the expense of publishing a
translation of this treatise by Admiral C. H. Davis, U. S. N., from
the Latin. It furnishes a complete system of formulas for computing
the movements of a body in any of the curves belonging to the class
of conic sections, and a general method of determining the orbit of a
planet or a comet from three observations, as seen from the earth.

For a number of years aid was afforded to the publicatian of Gould’s
American Astronomical Journal, which rendered good service to the
science by making promptly known to foreign observers the results of
the labors of their contemporaries in America. It has also had re-
duced by Mr. Charles A. Schott, and published at its own expense,
the astronomical observations made by Dr. Kane in the arctic regions,
and has now in hand those which were made in the same regions by
Dr. Hayes.

Congress having authorized in 1849 an astronomical expedition
under Lieutenant Gilliss to the southern hemisphere for the purpose
of determining the parallax of the planets, and consequently their
distance from the sun, by observations on Venus and Mars, accident-
ally failed to make the appropriation for instruments. This omission
was supplied by the Institution, which was subsequently indemnified
for the expense by the Chilian government.

In the observation of all the larger solar eclipses which have hap-
pened since the date of its organization the Institution has actively
REPORT OF THE: SECRETARY. ATW

and efficiently co-operated by publishing projections of the phases and
times of their occurrence in different parts of America.

Under its auspices, and partly at its expense, an expedition was
inaugurated by Lieutenant Gilliss to observe the great eclipse of 1858
in Peru, from which data of value for the improvement of solar and
lunar tables were determined, besides facts of interest in regard to
the physical constitution of the sun.

Assistance was also rendered to the expeditions under the direction
of the Coast Survey to observe the eclipse of July 18, 1860, one of
which was sent to Labrador, under the charge of Professor 8. Alex-
ander, of New Jersey, and the other to Washington Territory, under
that of Lieutenant Gilliss.

To these may be added an account of an instrument invented by
Rev. T. Hill, president of Harvard College, for the projection of

eclipses.

Physics and chemistry.—The Institution has fostered these sciences
in many different ways; among others, by importing models of the
most improved articles of apparatus, and making them known to
scientific men through lectures and otherwise.

It has instituted an extensive series of experiments on building
materials, particularly in reference to those employed by the gov-
ernment in the construction of the Capitol and other public edifices;
also alike series on acoustics, as applied to public halls, and the prin-
ciples deduced from these were practically applied in the construction
of a model lecture-room. It has made a very extended series of ex-
periments on different substances employed for light-house illumina-
tion, from which has resulted the substitution of another material for
sperm oil, and the consequent annual saving of a large amount of
money to the government.

In compliance with requests made by different departments of the
governinent and of Congress, particularly since the war, it has con-
ducted various series of investigations, principally in relation to ques-
tions involving mechanical, chemical, and physical principles, and has
made reports on subjects of this kind amounting, in the aggregate,
to several hundred.

To facilitate researches, a laboratory has been established and kept
constantly in working condition, the privilege of using it having been
given to various competent persons for experimenting in different
branches of physical science. Just now it is occupied by Dr. Weth-
erill for the purpose of conducting a series of analyses of samples of
48 REPORT OF, TME SECRETARY.

air from the halls of Congress, &c., from which a report is to be
made, under the direction of the Institution, on the ventilation of the
public buildings of this city.

The most important publications under this head are the researches
relative to electric currents, by Professor Secchi; on the explosibility
of nitre, by Dr. Hare; on the ammonia-cobalt bases, by Drs. Gibbs
and Genth; and on astronomical photography, by Dr. Henry Draper.

A valuable report on recent improvements in the chemical arts by
Booth & Morfit was published in 1852, and there have been given in the
annual reports of the Institution a series of translations and articles
presenting a view of the progress of physics and chemistry from
year to year, since 1853, among which we may particularly notice
the translation of Miller on recent contributions to electricity, and
the reprint of Powell on Radiant Heat.

Terrestrial magnetism.—The subject of terrestrial magnetism has
been prosecuted simultaneously with that of meteorology, and an
observatory was erected in the Smithsonian grounds, fitted up with
the most approved instruments, and conducted under the joint
auspices of the Institution and of the Coast Survey. After remain-
ing in operation for several years, the instruments were transferred
to Key West, as a remote station where observations were still more
desirable. Instruments were also furnished an expedition to Mexico,
and used with much success by Mr. Sonntag, whose results were
published in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. Appa-
ratus was also furnished to Dr. Kane, Dr. Hayes, and other explorers,
by means of which valuable results were obtained.

Of the more important publications of the Institution, which have
tended to advance this science, may be mentioned the articles by
Dr. Locke, on the dip and intensity; the elaborate discussion, by
Professor Bache, of the magnetic observations made at Girard College
from 1841 to 1845; the report on magnetical observations in the
arctic seas by Dr. Kane, reduced at the expense of the Institution
by Mr. C. A. Schott, and those made in Pennsylvania and adjacent
States by Professor Bache, and in Mexico by Mr. Sonntag.

Explorations.—In the deficiency of means for more extended oper-
ations, as has been frequently represented in the annual reports, the
efforts of the Institution in the line of explorations and collections are
confined, as strictly as possible, to America; but within this limit
there are few regions which have not furnished scope, in some form,
to its activity. Arctic America, all the unknown portions of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49,

United States, Mexico, Central and South America, and the West:
Indies, have been laid under contribution for facts and materials by-
which to advance science.

An eminently useful influence has been exerted by the Institution.
through the aid it has afforded in the organization of the different.
government explorations by land and by sea. Whether by official
representations to the heads of departments, or personal influence:
with officers and employés, it has secured the engagement of indi-
viduals competent to collect facts and specimens; it has instructed
persons thus engaged, and others, in the details of observation ; it
has superintended the preparation, and, in some cases, borne the ex-
pense of the necessary outfits ; has furnished fresh supplies from time
to time to the collectors while in the field ; received the collections
made, and preserved them for future study, or at once consigned
them to the hands of competent persons, both at home and abroad,
for investigation; directing the execution of the necessary drawings
and engravings for the reports, and, finally, superintending the print-
ing and even the distribution of any available copies of the completed
works to institutions of science. Prior to the establishment of the
Institution but little had been done by our government in the way of
scientific explorations, with the exception of that under Captain
Wilkes. But since then nearly every United States expedition,
whether a survey for a Pacific railroad route, a boundary line between
the United States and regions north or south of it, or within its
borders, a wagon-road across the Rocky mountains, or an ordinary
topographical exploration, has been influenced and aided more or
less, as above stated.. A list of the expeditions has been, from time
to time, published in the annual reports, and it is sufficient here to
say that their total number up to the present time is about fifty.

Besides these, similar explorations have been carried on without
any reference to the government, and either entirely or in a great
measure at the expense of the Institution, and always at its sugges~
tion, or under its direction. Prominent among these may be men-
tioned the three years’ researches in the arctic regions, by Mr. Ken-
nicott, with the co-operation of gentlemen of the Hudson’s Bay Com-
pany; of Mr. Drexler, in the region of Hudson’s bay, and also in the-
Rocky mountains ; of Mr. Coues, in Labrador ; of Lieutenant Feilner,
in Nebraska and Northern California; of Mr. John Xantus, at Fort;
Tejon, Cape St. Lucas, and in Western Mexico; of Lieutenant Trow-
bridge, on the coast of California; of Drs. Cooper and Suekley, in
Western America generally; of Drs. Coues and Beers, in Kansas,

In addition to the collections which have been received from ex-
plorations organized under the direction of the Institution, large
numbers of duplicate specimens have been presented by the meteor-
ological observers and other Smithsonian collaborators, the whole
forming a body of material for the iliustration and study of the pro-
ducts of the American continent unequalled by any collection pre-
viously made. The explorations, however, as might be inferred,
have not been confined to the collecting of specimens, but have also

-furnished information relative to the topography, geology, physical
geography, ethnology, and the living fauna of the regions visited.

The results have been published by government, the Institution,
or other parties. The extent and importance of these publications
may be seen in the volumes of the reports of the Pacific rai‘road and
Mexican boundary surveys; of the United States astronomical expe-
dition to Chili, under the late lamented Captain Gilliss ; of Captain
Stansbury’s exploration of Utah; of Lieutenant Michler’s of the
Isthmus of Darien, &c., &c.; in the volumes of the Smithsonian pub-
lications, and in the transactions of nearly all the scientific institu-
tions in the United States.

In order to facilitate the operations of collectors, a series of gene-
ral directions have been prepared and widely distributed, free of
charge, for collecting, preserving, and transporting specimens of
natural history, and also special instructions for collecting nests, eggs,
shells, insects, &c.

Description and distribution of collections and specimens. —The object
of making these collections, in conformity with the policy of the In-
stitution, was not merely to supply a large museum in Washington
with permanent specimens or duplicates for exchange, but to furnish
the naturalists of the world with the materials for advancing the
science of the natural history of North America, and of facilitating
the study of its various branches by supplying museums both in the
United States and in Europe with sets of type specimens.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. |

In pursuance of this object, full sets of the specimens collected
have been submitted to a large number of naturalists, both in this
country and abroad, for critical study and description, and it is not
too much to say that scarcely a monographic investigation has been
conducted for ten years past in any branch of American zoology which
has not derived part or the whole of its material from the Smithsonian
collections. Duplicates of the specimens, when described, have been
made up into series for distribution, always accurately labelled, and
are usually types of some published investigation. The average of
such distribution has, for the last ten years, been at least ten thousand
specimens annually, while the distribution of 1864 amounted to nearly
five thousand species and seventeen thousand specimens. In this
way, besides supplying the principal museums of Europe with speci-
mens, all the older museums in this country as well as Canada have
been largely increased, and the foundation for several new establish-
ments of a similar kind has been furnished. As an illustration of
what has been done in the way last mentioned, I may cite the large
donation of labelled specimens which has been made to the museum
of the University of Michigan, and the co-operation which has been
afforded the liberal-minded citizens of Chicago in founding a museum
and establishing a society of natural history, which, under the direc-
tion of Mr. Kennicott and Dr. Stimpson, is diffusing a taste for the
study of nature in that city of unparalleled growth, which cannot be
otherwise than highly salutary in ameliorating the sensual effects of
great material prosperity.

The Institution has also done good service in promoting and assist-
ing the formation of local societies in rural districts for the collection
of specimens and the recording of natural phenomena. ‘To all socie-
ties of this kind, as well as to colleges and academies making special
application, Jabelled specimens have been presented.

This distribution of specimens is very different from the ordinary
exchanges conducted between institutions or individuals, which usually
involve the return of an equivalent. The question with the Smith-
sonian Institution is, not what can be had in return, but where a par-
ticular specimen or series of specimens can be placed so as best to
advance the cause of science, by being most accessible to the largest
number of students engaged in original investigations.

Paleontology, geology, physical geography, &c.—Appropriations have
been made for investigations of the surface formation of the Con-
necticut valley by Professor EH. Hitchcock, and for the collection of
materials for the illustration of the geology and paleontology of par-
52 ’ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ticular regions. Appropriation has also been made to Professor
Guyot for a barometrical survey of the different parts of the Al-
leghany mountains, and to other persons for collecting observations
on heights, as determined in different parts of the country by the
various canal and railway surveys.

The publications on these subjects, besides the papers of Professor
Hitchcock on surface geology, are as follows:

A memoir on Mosasaurus, by Dr. R. W. Gibbs.

On the extinct species of the fossil ox and sloth of North America,
and on the ancient Fauna of Nebraska, by Dr. Leidy.

On the Physical Geography of the Mississippi Valley, by Charles
Ellet.

On the Law of Deposit of Flood Tide, by Admiral Davis.

On the Fluctuations of the level of the great American Lakes, by
C. Whittlesey.

On the Paleontology of the Upper Missouri, and Check List of
miocene, cretaceous and jurassic Invertebrata, by F. B. Meek.

A memoir by Dr. Leidy, now in press, on the extinct reptiles of
the cretaceous period, will, it is believed, be a valuable manual of
reference.

The Institution has published a Check List of minerals, with their
symbols, prepared by Mr. Hegleston, with special reference to facili-
tating the labelling of the Smithsonian minerals and the exchange of
specimens, and it may be mentioned that extensive distribution has
been made of specimens of building stone employed by the govern-
ment.

Botany.—This branch of general natural history has been advanced
by the Institution, not only by means of the publication of original
memoirs, but also by explorations and collections made at the expense
of the Smithsonian fund. The most important work which has
been published is a large quarto volume, illustrated by expensive
colored plates, on the algae of the entire North American waters.
The work was written for the Institution by Dr. Harvey, of the
University of Dublin, and has been the means of rendering this
order of the vegetable kingdom more generally known. The Insti-
tution has also published several papers on the plants of New Mexico
and California, by Dr. Gray, of Cambridge, and Dr. Torrey, of New
York.

Duplicates of the specimens described have been presented to in-
stitutions at home and abroad. Considerable labor has also been ex-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

pended in the preparation of an original report on the forest trees of
America, by Dr. Gray. This work, however, has been interrupted
for some time, but will be resumed, it is expected, during the present
year.

General Zoology.—A large part of the collections made by the In-
stitution belong to the general class of zoology, intended to advance
the study of animal life upon the continent of America.

The ornithology of America has always been a speciality of the
Smithsonian Institution, more efforts having been made to perfect its
collection in this department than any other. The Institution has pub-
lished the first part of a work by Dr. T. M. Brewer, suitably illus-
trated, on the distribution and habits of North American birds during
the breeding season, with descriptions and figures of their eggs, the
materials being derived entirely from the collections of the Institution,
and mostly made at its special request. ‘This is the first separate
work on North American zoology ever prepared. A catalogue of
North American birds, prepared by Professor 8. F. Baird, has been
extensively used at home and abroad in labelling collections.

Professor Baird is now engaged in preparing a general report
on our knowledge of North American ornithology to the present
date, with the addition of the species of Central and South America
and the West Indies; the materials being derived almost entirely
from the specimens collected by the Institution, which have been in-
creased since the publication of the extensive work on the same sub-
ject by Professor Baird in the Pacific railroad report, from 12,000 to
35,000.

The collections which have been made by the Institution for the
illustration of mammalia have been very extensive, amounting to
6,000 specimens, and have not only included many duplicates of the
species previously known, but a very large number entirely new to
science. A catalogue of North American mammals, chiefly those
collected by the Institution, prepared by Professor Baird, has been
published and distributed to those interested in the study; also a
monograph of North American bats, prepared by Dr. H. Allen.
Materials are now in course of accumulation to complete the account
of the classes of mammals of North America which have not been in-
cluded in the publications of the Institution and Pacific railroad
reports.

As with all American vertebrata, the collections of reptiles and
fishes made by the Institution have been very extensive, and numer-
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ous monographs or articles have been published relative to them in
the Pacific railroad reports and the proceedings of different natural
history societies, the Institution having published a synopsis of the
serpents of North America, and a monograph of the Cottoids.

The Institution has materially aided the study of the entomology
of this country, not only by the collections in that branch, but by
preparing and publishing a series of works for the purpose of ex-
hibiting the state of knowledge on the subject and facilitating its
further advancement. It has published and distributed the follow-
ing under this head :

Instructions for collecting and preserving insects, and catalogues,
synopses, or monographs of the Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera,
and Neuroptera, prepared by the most competent authorities in Eu-
rope and America.

It has also in course of preparation works relative to the Hymen-
optera, Homoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, &. —

In the preparation of these publications the Institution is indebted

for gratuitous assistance to Dr. Jno. Leconte, Baron Osten Sacken,
and others.

Conchology.—A large collection of specimens of shells was received
from the United States exploring expedition, which has been much
increased by subsequent additions. All the shells of the west coast
of the United States, and those generally collected by the exploring
expedition, have been put into the hands of Mr. P. P. Carpenter, of
England, the new ones to be described for publication, and the dupli-
cates of the whole to be arranged for distribution to museums, col-
leges, and other establishments. This work is nearly completed,
and a large number of partial sets of the shells have been distributed
in accordance with the plan just mentioned. The publications on
this subject are lists of North American shells, circulars relative to
collecting, an elementary introduction to the study of conchology,
and an extensive work in two octavo volumes on the Bibliography
of North American Conchology, by W. G. Binney, and a monograph
of the Corbiculade, by Temple Prime. Besides these a number of
articles are in the press or in course of preparation.

Microscopy.—Encouragement has been given to this branch of
science by importing, as samples, simple formsof working microscopes,
and also by stimulating our native artists to greater exertion in the
construction of this instument, by ordering the best that could be
produced. Samples of microscopic organisms have been collected
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

and distributed to observers, and examinations and reports have
been made on a large number of this class of objects sent to the In-
stitution. The publications in regard to this subject are.a number
of papers by Professor Bailey, of West Point, and a very interesting
memoir by Dr. Leidy, of Philadelphia, on a fauna and flora within
living anunals.

Physiology.—No experiments on this subject have been made under
the immediate direction of the Institution, although it has furnished
the materials for investigation by other parties. The publications in
regard to it are chemical and physical researches concerning North
American vertebrata, by Dr. J. Jones ; researches upon the venom
of the rattlesnake, with an investigation of the anatomy and physi-
ology of the organs concerned, by Dr. S. W. Mitchell; on the
breathing organs of turtles, by Drs. Mitchell and Morehouse; on
the anatomy of the nervous system of rana pipiens, by Dr. J. Wy-
man; and on the medulla oblongata by Dr. John Dean.

Ethnology and Philology.—One of the earliest efforts on the part of
the Institution was directed to the advancement of the science of
American ethnology. Its first publication as well as introductory
volume to the series of Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, be-
ing the work of Squier and Davis, on the ancient monuments of the
Mississippi valley, remains the standard treatise on this subject.
This was followed by a similar work on the antiquities of New York,
by Mr. Squier ; and those of Wisconsin, by Mr. Lapham, of Ohio ;
and of Lake Superior, by Mr. Whittlesey ; a memoir on some anti-
quities of Mexico, by Brantz Mayer; and a general introduction to
the whole subject of American archeology, by Mr. Haven, besides
many articles of less extent in one cr another of the Smithsonian
series. Several pamphlets of instructions for making observations
and collections in this science have also been issued.

In the department of philology, also, the Institution, has evinced
its zeal and activity by the publication, among others, of the elaborate
work on the Dakota language, by Mr. Riggs; that on the Yoruba
language, by Mr. Bowen; and that on the Chinook jargon, by Mr.
Turner and Mr. Gibbs. To Mr. Shea, of New York, who is engaged
in the preparation of a library of American languages, annual appro-
priations from the funds of the Institution have been made in fur-
therance of the publication of linguistic memoirs furnished by its
correspondents.

Systematic efforts have been directed by the Tristan to the
collection of as perfect a series as possibleof the specimens of Ameri-
56 ' REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

can antiquities, and of those illustrative of the habits of the modern
native tribes. Already an extensive collection has been accumulated,
and the preparation and distribution of a series of colored casts of
the more interesting specimens of aboriginal art have been com-
menced. The former picture gallery had just been fitted up with
cases two hundred feet in length, for the reception of these, when the
disastrous fire occurred, which destroyed the upper part of the centre
building; fortunately, however, before any of these specimens had
been placed in the room.

Correspondence. —The Institution has constantly received a large
number of communications, asking information on a variety of sub-
jects, particularly in regard to the solution of scientific questions, the
names and characters of objects of natural history, and the analysis
of soils, minerals, and other materials which pertain to the industrial
resources of the country. Answers have in all cases been given to
these inquiries, either directly by the officers of the Institution or by
reports from the Smithsonian collaborators. A considerable portion
of the correspondence burned in the office of the Secretary was of this
character. The loss in this case is to be regretted, not only on
account of the valuable information the letters and answers contained,
but also on account of the illustration they afforded of the influence
of the Institution, and the condition of the public mind at a given
time. Every subject connected with science which strongly attracts
popular attention never fails to call forth a large number of inquiries
and suggestions.

International exchanges. —To facilitate the direct correspondence
between the learned institutions and scientific men of the two worlds,
and the free exchange of their publications, has, from the first, been
a special object of attainment with the Smithsonian Institution. Year
by year its plans for this purpose have been modified and improved,
until the system has become as nearly complete and satisfactory as
the funds and force at its disposal will allow. At the present day it
is the great medium of scientific intercommunication between the New
World and the Old; its benefits and services being recognized alike by
individuals, institutions, and governments. Its parcels pass all the
custom-houses without question or interference, while American and
foreign lines of transportation, with rare exceptions, vie with each
other in the extent of the privileges accorded it. To so great an
extent has its sphere of activity been enlarged, that it is no exaggera-
tion to say that a very large proportion of all international exchanges
of the kind referred to are now made through its instrumentality.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57

At the present time the Institution is prepared to receive, at periods
made known through its circulars, any books or pamphlets of scientific,
literary, or benevolent character which any institutions or individuals
in America may wish to present to a correspondent elsewhere, sub-
ject only to the condition of being delivered in Washington free of
cost, and of being accompanied by a separate list of the parcels sent.
Where any party may have special works to distribute, the Institu-
tion is always prepared to furnish a list of suitable recipients. In
many cases where works of value have been published by the United
States or State governments, likely to be of importance to students
abroad, application has been made by the Institution for copies, in
most cases with success. The articles and volumes, when received,
are assorted and combined into packages, and these, after being
properly addressed and enclosed in boxes, are despatched to the
agents of the Institution in London, Leipsic, Paris, and Amsterdam.
The boxes are there unpacked, and the contents distributed through
the proper channels ; the returns for these transmissions are received
by the same agents, and boxed, and forwarded to Washington, from
which point the parcels for other parties are sent to their proper
destination. All the expenses of packing, boxing, agencies, freights,
&c., are borne by the Institution, with the exception of the local
conveyance of single parcels by express or otherwise within the
United States.

LOCAL OBJECTS.

Under this head we have classed those parts of the programme
which were indicated by Congress, and which do not, so directly as
the objects we have already described, contribute to the advance of
knowledge. It will be seen, however, that they have been made as
far as possible to harmonize with the active operations, and to assist
in their progress.

Inbrary.—Although the act of Congress directed that provision
should be made for the »ccommodation of a ligrary, on a liberal scale,
it was soon seen, after the organization of the Institution, that it
would be impossible, from the income which could be devoted to it,
to establish a first-class general library. Even had this been practi-
cable, it would still have seemed superfluous to do so in the very
vicinity of the miscellaneous library of Congress, which is every
year increasing in extent under the liberal appropriations which are
annually made for the purchase of books. It was therefore deemed
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

preferable; and more consonant with the purposes of the Institution, —
to forma special library, which might constitute, as it were, a sup-

plement to the library of Congress, and-consist, for the most part,

of complete sets of the proceedings and transactions of all the learned

societies in the wdfld, and of other serials essential for reference by

students specially engaged in original scientific research. The efforts

of the Institution to carry out this plan, which has since been sanc-

tioned by Congress, have been eminently successful. Principally

through exchanges, and occasionally hy purchase, a more complete

collection of the works above mentioned has been procured than is

to be found in any library of the United States, or is easily met with

even in Europe. The Institution has been assisted in making this
collection by the liberality of many of the older libraries abroad, which,

on application, have furnished from their duplicates volumes and even
whole sets to complete series of works long since out of print, and
which, in some cases, could not have been obtained through any
other means. The library isalso quite rich in monographic or special

treatises in the physical and natural sciences, lacking as yet, it is true,

some of the more expensive volumes, but still affording the means of.
prosecuting almost any scientific investigation. One specialty con-

sists of the large number of maps end charts obtained by exchange

from geographical and hydrographical establishments, &c. This col-

lection is as complete as any in the country.

No effort is spared to render the library of the Institution condu-
cive to the advance of science. Two editions of the catalogue of
serial works have already been published, and a third is now in press;
this will probably fill four hundred octavo pages, and will be com-
pleted in the course of the present year, to be followed by a cata-
logue of the special works.

As in most libraries of special character, and, indeed, in most large
public libraries, the public are allowed free access to the library-room
during office hours, but are not generally permitted to take books
away. When, however, any applicant is known to be engaged in
the prosecution of original investigations, which promise to advance
science, and requires the assistance of books found in the Smithsonian

library, they are freely lent, even to persons in the remote portions of
the United States. Any losses which may occur by the adoption of
this course are more than compensated by the advantages derived
from it. ’

Congress had provided by the law of organization that a copy of
all copyright works should be presented to the library of this Institu
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

tion. This it was supposed would be the means of securing im-
portant additions to the library. It was found, however, in practice,
to impose a burden on the funds of the Institution for which no
adequate compensation accrued ; copies of the most valuable works
. were not presented, because there was no penalty imposed for the
neglect to comply with the requirement, and the expense of clerk-
hire in recording and furnishing certificates was greater than the
value of the articles received, consisting, as they did principally, of
sheets of music, labels of patent medicines, novels, and element-
ary works of instruction. The law was, therefore, on special appli-
cation, so modified that authors were required in future only to send
a copy of their works to the copyright bureau of the Department of
the Interior and to the Library of Congress.

A special library of the character above described, consisting of
serials, must of necessity constantly increase with the additions made
to the series of the existing associations which annually publish their
transactions. The Smithsonian library, therefore, comprises a prin-
ciple of indefinite augmentation, both as regards extent and value ;
and although this increase will result mainly from the exchanges
produced by the active operations, yet additional accommodations
will be constantly acquired. Hence it may become a matter of consid-
eration, hereafter, whether, since Congress has appropriated $160, 000
to the enlargement of the accommodation for its own library, it may
not be expedient to request that the Smithsonian collection be re-
ceived and arranged as one of its departments, while the free use and
general control of the same shall still be retained by the Institution.

Museum.—The same remarks which have been made in regard to
the library may, with little modification, be applied to the museum.
The portion of the funds of the Institution which it is practicable to
devote to the museum is not sufficient to support an establishment of
this kind worthy of the seat of government of the United States.
Indeed, it is generally now conceded by those who have critically ex-
amined the subject, that the accommodation and perpetual mainten-
ance Of a large collection of objects of nature and art intended for
popular exhibition, or even for educational purposes, ought not to have
been imposed upon the Smithsonian fund. It has been seen from the
foregoing statement how much can be done in the way of advancing
natural history independent of a costly edifice, and the support of
a popular museum in which are to be continually exhibited even
type specimens. It is true that specimens of this character ought
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to be preserved for study; but seeing that there are in the country a
number of special museums which would gladly become the custodians
of these objects, and that the hope is yet confidently entertained
that Congress will, in due time, establish a national museum which
shall rival those of other countries, it has been thought advisable
to restrict the collections which are retained in the Smithsonian
museum—first, to those made by the exploring expedition, the care
of which Congress has devolved upon the Institution ; and, second,
to such type specimens as are thought of special interest as illus-
trating the Smithsonian publications.

The museum has been’rendered particularly attractive to the visit-
ors and inhabitants of Washington by the large number of birds and
mammals which have been mounted for public exhibition, and in this
way it has undoubtedly contributed to the popularity, though it has
diminished the efficiency, of the Institution. The danger, however,
to be guarded against, is the constant tendency to expand the col-
lections, and hence gradually to absorb the income in their support.
It should be recollected that the building has borne upon the re-
sources of the Institution with a cost of more than $300,000, and that
at least an additional $100,000 will be necessary to repair the recent
damages, and this mainly to render the edifice better adapted for the
accommodation of the library and museum.

Little has been said in this sketch in regard to the gallery of art.
The impropriety of expending the income of the bequest in attempt-
ing to form a collection of articles in this line worthy of the country
has had no prominent advocates, even among artists; still, in con-
nexion with the museum, a collection has been formed which princi-
pally consists of plaster casts of distinguished individuals, and a few
pictures which have either been presented to the Institution or are
the property of the government. The only purchase in this line
which the Institution has made is that from Hon. George P. Marsh,
of a series of valuable engravings to illustrate the early history of
art.

Lectures. —As a part of the programme of organization. finally
adopted, courses of lectures were to be delivered, but:instead of at-
tempting to furnish popular instruction by this means to all parts of
the country, as was at first proposed, the lectures have been confined
to the city of Washington ; and in order to render them generally
useful, synopses of the more important ones have been published in
the annual reports. At the commencement of the Institution, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

before the plan of organization was generally understood, special
care was taken to invite as lecturers men of prominence in the line
of literature that they might have an opportunity to become familiar
with the plan adopted, and in this way many prejudices were re-
moved and much information diffused as to the character of the es-
tablishment.

The lectures were commenced before the building was erected, the
first course being in 1847, by the Rev. Dr. Scoresby, of England, on
the construction and use of the large telescope of Harl Rosse, and
have been continued every winter up to the present time. Until
within the last four years they were well attended, and no doubt
produced a beneficial effect ; but since the commencement of the war
and the introduction into the city of a large number of sources of
amusement, the audience has fallen off, or has been composed in a
large degree of persons seeking amusement rather than information,
The most important result produced by the lectures is that derived
from their publication. ‘

Nothing definite can be said at present as to the financial arrange-
ments for the repair of the building. The subject is still before Con-
gress, and although the idea has been confidently entertained that an
appropriation would be made for the purpose, yet from the discussion
- which took place in the meeting of the joint committee of the two
Houses appointed to consider this matter, I do not think a resolution
authorizing such an appropriation will be adopted. In view of the
impression produced by this discussion, at which I was invited to be
present, I suggested to the committee that if the members would
agree to recommend, an appropriation to pay the back premium on
coin for the last four years’ interest on the Smithsonian fund, and in
the event of the success of the recommendation, I thought the Regents
would have it in their power to finish the repairs by means of the
extra fund which has been accumulated.

Respectfully submitted,

62 ARTICLES REFERRED TO IN THE SECRETARY'S REPORT,

DRAPER’S TELESCOPE.

BY THE REV. T. W. WEBB, A.M., F.RJA.S.

From the ‘‘ Intellectual Obserzcr,’’ London.

It is gratifying to observe that, amidst all the calamities and distresses and
contusion of a most unhappy civil war, the studies of peace have not been
wholly lost to sight. A remarkable instance of this is afforded by the recent
appearance, among the publications of the American Smithsonian Institution,
of a very interesting and valuable memoir, “On the Construction of a Silvered
Glass Telescope, 154 inches in aperture, and its use in celestial photography,
by Henry Draper, M.D., Professor of Natural Science in the University of New
York.” <A copy of this, through the courtesy of the author, being now in my
hands, I have thought that some account of its contents might prove interesting,
especially at a time when silvered glass specula are attracting some attention in
England, and (unless we are much mistaken) are likely to be more generally
known and valued as most important aids to the progress of observation.

The opening sentence of this memoir requires, however, we venture to think,
a little qualification. “The construction of a reflecting telescope capable of
_ showing every celestial object now known,” Dr. Draper tells us, ‘“ is not a very
difficult task.” We should have no hesitation in expunging the negative here,
unless it were permitted to add, “when study, and labor, and ingenuity, and
perseverance have been brought to bear upon it, equal to those displayed by
Dr. Draper.” His subsequent remark is of more universal application: “The
cost of materials is but trifling compared with the result obtained; and I can
see no reason why silvered glass instruments should not come into general use
among amateurs. ‘The future hopes of astronomy lie in the multitude of ob-
servers, and in the concentration of the action of many minds.” His first idea
was derived from an examination, in 1857, of Lord Rosse’s great reflector, and
of the machinery by which it was perfected; and on his return home in the
following year, he resolved to construct a similar, though smaller instrument,
larger, however, than any in America, and adapted to celestial photography.
A metal speculum was first completed, but was split in two during the winter
of 1860 by the expansion of a few drops of water that became frozen in the
supporting case ; and his attention was then, at Sir John Herschel’s suggestion,
turned to silvered glass mirrors, as reflecting more than 90 per cent. of incident
light, with only gth of the weight of metal. The year 1861 was occupied in
overcoming the difficulties of grinding and polishing three 154-inch disks of
glass, as well as a variety of smaller pieces. Three similar mirrers were found
almost essential, as two would often be so much alike that a third was necessary
to ghin a further step in advance. One was made to acquire a parabolic figure,
(see INTELLECTUAL OBSERVER, iii, 213,) and bore a power of 1000. The
winter was spent in perfecting the art of silvering and studying photographie
DRAPER’'S TELESCOPE. 63

processes. <A large portion of 1862 was spent with a regiment in a campaign
in Virginia, but in the autumn sand-clocks and clepsydras of various kinds were
made, and the driving mechanism attained great excellence. During the wiater
the art of communicating the parabolic figure by Foucault's method was acquired,
and two 15-inch mirrors, and two of 9 inches, for enlarging photographs, were
completed. ‘The greater part of 1863 was spent in lunar and planetary pho-
tography and the enlargement of negatives, some of which were maguified to
three feet in diameter. T'wo specula of 154 inches were also completed, ground
to an oblique focus for front view. ‘This work,” he adds—and any one with
very little experience may judge of the immense amount of toil involved—* has
ail been accomplished in the intervals of professional labor.” Many of the
expedients adopted in the working, which are detailed at full length, are

”?

strikingly characteristic of ingenuity as well as perseverance. To avoid the
tediousness of grinding out defects in a metal surface, they were “stopped
out,” after the manner of engravers, and the uncovered space corroded away
by the action of nitro-hydrochloric acid. By a similar mode, the strength of
the acid being graduated in separate zones towards the edge, an increase of 15
inches in focal length was gained. The grinder and mirror were at another
time included in a voltaic circuit to abridge the grinding process, and an idea
Was entertained of saving much weight by electrotyping a brass mirror with
speculum metal. When he commenced operations with glass he had to polish
with his own hands more than one hundred mirrors of various sizes, from 19
inches to 4 inch, and to experience very frequent failures for three years before
he was able to produce large surfaces certainly and speedily. His labor would
have been much diminished, inasmuch as he would have been spared the cause-
less condemnation of many fine mirrors, as well as the working of some square
ones, had he become earlier aware of an important fact respecting the rigidity
of the material.* Generally speaking, a sheet of glass,even when very thick,
can hardly be set on edge without so much flexure as to render it optically
worthless ; but, fortunately, in every disk that he tried, there was one diameter
on either end of which it might stand without harm. On turning a disk of 154
inches, with a thickness of 14 inch, one quarter round, it could hardly be
realized that the surface was the same: 90° more restored it to its original
defining power ; and this effect was found to be independent of any irregularity
on the edge of the disk and of the mode of support. Dr. Draper refers it, with
great probability, to the structure of the glass, resulting from its having been
subjected to rolling pressure. A similar irregularity of structure is knewn to
obtain in many large object-glasses, and Dr. Draper specifies the great achromatic
by Cauchoix, presented by the late Duke of Northumberland to the University
of Cambridge, as having had its lenses turned round by Mr. Airy in monnting,
for this reason. Short’s Gregorian specula, too, were always marked on the
same account. The strange deformations of image produced by heat, even by

cerned, but I stopped short of Dr. Draper’s discovery of a regular axis of rigidity.

the warmth of the hand for a few seconds, are described and represented.
From such distortions the speculum would not recover in ten miuutes, and the
error would be rendered permanent by repolishing in that condition ; and so
injurious may such causes, even in a lesser degree, prove during the delicate
process of the final correction of the spherical error, that “a current of cold or
warm air, a gleam of sunlight, the close approach of some person, an unguarded
touch, the application of cold water injudiciously, will ruin the labor of days.”
He found it a matter of not unfrequent occurrence that a speculum would per-
form much better with rays of a certain amount of obliquity,* deviating from
2° to 3° from the axis. It is obvious that if this peculiar form could be pro-
duced at will, and to an adequate degree, it would render the Lemairean or
front view telescope perfect. Dr. D., however, found that the image was never
quite as fine as in the usual kind of mirrors. <A letter of Maskelyne subse-
quently came under his notice, in which he describes a very great improvement
effected in a 6-foot reflector by Short, by inclining the large speculum 24°, and
remarks, very reasonably, that “ probably it will be found that this circum-
stance is by no means peculiar to this telescope ;”’ a hint which may be worthy
of the consideration of the possessors of reflectors. Such surfaces require to be
reground, or “re-fined,” ¢.e., finished with the finest emery, to get rid of this
obliquity, as repolishing, though occasionally successful in a few minutes, wifl
not always effect it; the attempt failed in one instance, though continued for
133 hours.

The modes of forming the requisite tools, of preparing emery, of grinding,
polishing, testing, (by Foucault’s mode,) and silvering the surface, are somewhat
too technical to find a place here, but some interesting facts are worthy of being
referred to. Such is the effect produced by the removal from a cast-iron tool,
154 inches in diameter, divided into #-inch squares, like a chessboard, of every
alternate square, by an acid. Though the corrosion extended only to a very
slight depth, it flattened the curvature of the tool 72 inches. “This shows
what a state of tension and compression there must be in such a mass, when the
removal of a film of metal J;th of an inch thick, here and there, from one sur-
face, causes so great a change.” Another important remark is, how injurious
an atmospheric disturbance is set up by the intermixture of currents of warm
air from the observer’s person with the rays falling on or reflected from the
mirror—an observation which I made many years ago, and which any one may
test by directing a Newtonian to any bright object, and placing one hand beneath
the aperture, while an eye-piece held in the other hand, and applied to the eye,
is carried back a considerable distance, so as to obtain a very long focus, and
render the ascending currents more visible. It has not, I believe, been generally
remarked how prejudicial an effect this must have on definition in the front-
view reflector, and it would be a worthy object of attention to remove the evil
by the interposition of some non-conducting shield.

*T became acquainted with this fact many years ago, when working metals for a small
Newtonian reflector.

DRAPER’S TELESCOPE. 65

A full trial was given to no less than seven machines, on the principles
employed by Lord Rosse and Lassell, with modifications of his own. ‘The
prime mover, called the “ foot-power,’’ was avery ingenious contrivance, in
which very little force is lost in overcoming friction, and which is frequently
employed in America for dairy use. Dr. D. himself generally walked in his
own, and has travelled some days, during five hours, more than ten miles. It
consists of an endless band of short transverse boards or “ treads,’ interlocking
so as to form a platform to tread upon, which will not yield downwards on its
upper side, but hangs loose in the return half beneath, and passing over wheels
and rollers at either end. This succession of boards, having one end a little
higher than the other, rams downwards as soon as a weight is placed upon it,
and communicates motion to a large wheel on the axle of the one over which it
turns, and through it to any connected machinery. Being placed between a
handrail on either side, it offers the appearance of a little narrow bridge, as over
a ditch, composed of transverse boards, on which the mover may walk all day
without getting a step forward. It is, in fact, a species of treadmill, of a much
more pleasant construction.

The mode of giving a parabolic figure finally preferred by Dr. D. is that of
“‘loeal retouches,” in which the edge of a spherical mirror is flattened, or, which
he thinks preferable, the centre is bored out deeper, by appropriate polishers of
curvatures differing slightly from that of the original tool on which it was
wrought. This method, as invented by M. Léon Foucault, at Paris, was em-
ployed by hand, but has been practiced by Dr. D. with suitable machinery, and
with excellent results ; his great specula, thus finished, bearing a power of 1200,
and dividing the celebrated test-pair 7? Andromede; while so great is the
light-collecting power of 154 inches, that the companion of Wega can be per-
ceived even with the unsilvered surface; some portions of the moon are even
more visible than after silvering—a hint worth notice. When silvered, the
quantity of lunar light is so overpowering as to impair for a long time the vision
of an eye placed at the focus. Several modes of silvering were tried by Dr. D.,
some devised by himself. Foucault’s proved uncertain in its results; that of
Cimeg, with tartrate of potash and soda, for looking-glasses, modified so as to
fit the silver for being polished on the reverse side, he found superior to any,
and in using it “never on any occasion failed to secure bright, hard, and in
every respect perfect films.” Their thickness is about 559595 of an inch—nearly
the same with that of gold-leaf of equal transparency—the sun appearing
through the silver of a light-blue tint. Variations in its thickness are conse-
quently only small fractions of that fraction, and of no optical moment whatever.
It tarnishes quickly if exposed to sulphuretted hydrogen—a defect which has
been avoided in the English process—and it may be split up into fissures by
damp; but heat does not affect it, and it is generally very enduring. “I have
some,” the doctor says, “which have been used as diagonal reflectors in the
Newtonian, and have been exposed during a large part of the day to the heat of
the sun concentwated by the 15}-inch mirror. These small mirrors are never
covered, and yet the one now in the telescope has been there a year, and has

had the dusty film, like that which accumulates on glass, polished off it a dozen
times.”

Besides other interesting optical particulars, the memoir contains many direc-
tions for the successful practice of celestial photography, some of which might
be found equally valuable for terrestrial purposes ; and to these we may advert
on a future occasion, adopting for the present the author’s closing remarks :
“Tn concluding this account of a silvered glass telescope, I may answer an
inquiry which, doubtless, will be made by many of my readers, whether this
kind of reflector can ever rival in size and efficiency such great metallic specula
as those of Sir W. Herschel, the Earl of Rosse, and Mr. Lassell? My expe-
rience in the matter, strengthened by the recent successful attempt of M. Fou-
cault to figure such a surface more than thirty inches in diameter, assures me
that not only can the four and six feet telescopes of those astronomers be
equalled, but even excelled. Itis merely an affair of expense and patience. I
hope that the minute details I have given in this paper may lead some one to
make the effort.”

BRIEF REVIEW OF A MEMOIR ON THE CRETACEOUS REPTILES OF THE
UNITED STATES, PUBLISHED IN THE FOURTEENTH VOLUME OF THE
SMITHSONIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.

BY THE AUTHOR, JOSEPH LEIDY, M. D

THE cretaceous formations are so named from the Latin creta, chalk, from the
fact that the chalk of England forms the most striking rock of the series.
They underlie or immediately precede the tertiary formations, and contain a
great many fossils. Plants are rare because the cretaceous rocks are all of
marine origin, or consist of deposits which were formed at the bottom of the
ocean. ‘The remains of animals are numerous, but they are confined to the
lower orders, as no authentic traces of birds or mammals have yet been dis-
covered in them.

Cretaceous formations, as indicated by their contained fossils and relative
position to other rocks, are widely extended throughout the United States,
though they contain no true chalk. They are mainly composed of beds of
sand, clay, soft and compact limestones. Among the sandy layers are extensive |
deposits known as green-sand, which, under the name of marl, is much em-
ployed as a fertilizing material.

The cretaceous formations extend in a large tract through New Jersey,
Maryland, and Delaware, and appear in isolated patches in North and South
Carolina and Georgia. From the western part of the latter State they curve
in a wide crescent-like tract through Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, to
the mouth of the Ohio river. Thence passing in a narrow band through
Arkansas, they expand so as to occupy a great portion of the region between
CRETACEOUS REPTILES OF THE UNITED STATES. 67

the Mississippi river and the Rocky mountains, reaching north into British
America, and south into Mexico. In New Jersey they are estimated to have
a thickness of from four to five hundred feet; in the region of the Upper
Missouri, from two to two thousand five hundred feet.

Multitudes of fossils are found in the American cretaceous formations, though
the species appear not to be so numerous as in those of Kurope. The mollusks
are particularly abundant, and among them are a great many species of cham-
bered shells. A species of ammonite is found on the Upper Missouri as large
as an ordinary fore-wheel of a wagon. Remains of fishes are Tikewise numerous,
but generally they are found in a very fragmentary condition. Scales, vertebree,
and teeth, are usually the fossils which represent them. ‘The teeth of sharks
are especially numerous. Bones of reptiles are also abundant, and their remains
form the subject of the author’s memoir. As in the European cretaceous
formations, no evidences have yet been discovered of the existence of birds or
mammals in those of the United States.

Most of ‘the reptilian remains described by the author have been derived
from New Jersey, where they are constantly being discovered in the digging
of marl for agricultural purposes. Various genera and species of the crocodile
family existed during the cretaceous period, as indicated by their remains.
Some of these had the skeleton constructed after the same pattern as those now
living, while others were peculiar, or have no near representatives in existence.

All living crocodiles, under which term we include the gavials and alligators,
have the vertebre or bones of the spinal column, with their bodies concave in
front and convex behind, so that they are firmly jointed in a ball and socket-
like manner. Several species of extinct crocodiles, having the spinal column
constructed in the same manner, have been discovered in the cretaccous lime-
stone and green-sand of New Jersey and Delaware. One of the latter species,
named Thoracosaurus neocesariensis, signifying the armor-covered saurian of
New Jersey, resembled in its form and size the modern long-snouted gavial, or
crocodile of the Ganges. A nearly entire skull of this animal was discovered
imbedded in limestone on the farm of General William Irick, near Vincenttown,
Burlington county, New Jersey, and is now preserved in the museum of the
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Fragments of jaws and long,
curved, conical teeth of the same species have been found in other localities of
the State, as the highlands of Neversink, the vicinity of Blackwoodtown, Cam-
den county, Big Timber creek, Gloucester county, and in Burlington county.
Vertebre and other bones, including specimens of the strong osseous plates of
the skin, have likewise been discovered in Burlington county.

The skull of this crocodile, when perfect, has measured over a yard in length,
and the whole animal about twenty-five feet.

A species of the same genus, the Thoracosaurus macrorhynchus has been
discovered in a cretaceous formation of France, and a fine skull of it is pre-
served in the museum of the Jardin des Plantes, at Paris.

Another extinct crocodile, named Bottosaurus Harlani, after Dr. Harlan, who
68 ARTICLES REFERRED TO IN THE SECRETARY'S REPORT.

first noticed the species in 1824, is yet only known from several fragments of
jaws, a few teeth, and vertebree, found in the green-sand of Burlington county,
New Jersey. The specimens indicate this crocodile to have resembled in its
construction and size the alligator of the Mississippi, or the crocodile of the Nile,
more nearly than the Gangetic gavial. Several smaller species of crocodiles,
with concavo-convex vertebree, or vertebrae of the same construction of those
of living crocodiles, are indicated by specimens of vertebree and other bones
found in the green-sand of New Jersey and Delaware.

Another crocodilian reptile, the remains of which have been found in the
ereen-sand of New Jersey, is the Hyposaurus Rogersti, named by Professor
Owen, of London, after Professor Rogers, who submitted several vertebrae of
the animal to his inspection about fifteen years ago. This crocodile belongs to
a more ancient type of structure than the former ones, and has no near living
representative. The vertebra have their bodies dished at both extremities, or
biconcave, as in fishes, though in a much less degree. No considerable portion
of the skeleton of this species has yet been discovered, and its remains are
usually in an exceedingly friable condition. The author has had the oppor-
tunity of observing specimens of vertebra, fragments of bones of the limbs,
and teeth of about eight different individuals. The teeth are long, narrow.
and curved conical like those of the Gangetic gavial, but are more or less com-
pressed, so as to present anterior and posterior trenchant or cutting borders,
The animal did not exceed in size the alligator of the Mississippi.

Another crocodilian reptile, much larger than any of the preceding, and con-
structed after a different type, has been named Discosaurus vetustus. Only
vertebrae and some of the small bones of the limbs of the species have as yet
been found. The bodies of the vertebra have their articular ends flat, or nearly
so, and they bear a general resemblance with the corresponding portions of the
vertebre of the living cetaceous, or animals of the dolphin and whale order.
The genus is named from the articular ends of the vertebral bodies appearing
as distinct disks or plates implanted on the latter. Remains of six different in-
dividuals have been observed by the author from the green-sand of New Jersey
and from other cretaceous formations of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. A ’
few bones of a foot of this reptile from New Jersey indicate the limbs to have
been constructed as fins, so that the animal was more eminently aquatic than
the true crocodiles.

An equally large crocodilian reptile with the one last indicated, and closely
allied to it, as proved by the construction of the vertebrx, has been named
Cimoliasaurus magnus, the generic term signifying its contemporaneous age
with the chalk. The remains of this animal, consisting of a number of verte-
bre, have as yet only been discovered in the green-sand of Burlington and
Monmouth counties, New Jersey.

To conclude with the American cretaceous crocodiles, a large tooth, belong-
ing to the museum of the Smithsonian Institution, from a deposit of the Red
siver of the North, indicates a peculiar species, to which the name of Pirato-
raurus plicatus has been given. The specimen was found in association with
a number of shark teeth, of species evidently of the cretaceous epoch.
CRETACEOUS REPTILES OF THE UNITED STATES. 69

One of the most extraordinary reptiles which existed during the erctaceous
period, both in Europe and America, is the Mosasaurus, or lizard of the Meuss.
It was of gigantic size, and is most nearly related, among living reptiles, to the
comparatively puny lacertians and monitors.

A nearly entire skull, including the jaws and teeth, of the Mosasaurus cam-
peri, was discovered in 1780 in one of the subterraneous quarries of St. Peter’s
Mount at Maestricht. When found, the quarrymen gave notice of its discovery
to Dr. Hoffman, a surgeon of Maestricht, who collected fossils. Dr. Hoffman
succeeded in safely removing the skull from its position in the quarry, imbedded
in a large block of stone, and had it conveyed to his residence. The remarka-
ble specimen having attracted much attention, its fame reached the ears of a
reverend canon who owned the ground above the quarry from whence the skull
had been obtained. The canon laid claim to the specimen and applied to law
for its possession. After a troublesome suit he obtained it, much to the cost
and chagrin of Dr. Hoffman. In 1795 the army of the French republic laid
siege to Maestricht and bombarded Fort St. Peter, near which was the country
residence of the canon, where the fossil skull was preserved. The general of
the French having been informed of the circumstances relating to the fossil,
gave orders that the artillerists should avoid that particular quarter. The
canon suspecting the object of this exemption, had the skull conveyed toa place
of safety in the city. After the army obtained possession of the latter, Freicine,
the representative of the people, promised a reward of six hundred bottles of
wine for the recovery of the skull, which had the desired effect, for the follow-
ing day a dozen grenadiers bore the specimen in triumph to his house. It was
subsequently conveyed to Paris, and now forms part of the collection of the
museum of the Jardin des Plantes. The skull of the Maestricht Mosasaurus, or
Maestricht monitor, as it is also called, was nearly four feet long; the lower
jaw three feet and three-quarters. The jaws were occupied by fifty-six teeth,
besides which there were sixteen at the entrance of the throat on the ptemygoid
bones. The teeth are large; have curved conical crowns, with the surfaces sub-
divided into narrow planes; and have remarkably robust fangs inserted into
deep sockets of the jaws, with which they became firmly co-ossified.

Cuvier estimated the number of vertebrae to have been one hundred and
thirty-three, and their bodies are concavo-convex, as in living crocodiles. The
tail vertebrae are especially remarkable from their construction, being provided,
as in fishes, with a co-ossified arch and spine below the bodies as well as above.
The character of these caudal vertebree indicates the tail to have been laterally
flattened and of great comparative depth, and thus well adapted to the aquatic
habits of the animal.

Remains of a species of Mosasaurus, equally huge with the Maestricht moni-
tor, are frequently found in New Jersey in the digging of green-sand for agri-
cultural purposes, but they are usually in a very fragmentary condition. Nev-
ertheless, not a year has passed within the last thirty that isolated teeth,
vertebral fragments of jaws, and other bones, have not been turned up in the

diggings of the marl. Some of the specimens of teeth exceed six inches in
length, but generally they are smaller.

The teeth present considerable variety, generally having curved conical or
pyramidal crowns, frequently more or less compressed, with the surfaces in
different degrees subdivided into narrow planes or nearly or quite devoid of
them. The root or fang is cylindrical and several times the bulk of' the crown,
and is inserted in a deep socket witl which it is usually observed firmly co-os-
sified, though it may also be loose, depending on the age or state of development
of the tooth. New teeth were incessantly developed as those in use were
worn away. They made their appearance at the back part internally of the
fangs of the latter, and their fangs were gradully hollowed to accommodate
the growth of the new teeth. The crowns of the old ones were then shed to
allow the new ones to occupy their place, and after the full growth of the new
teeth their fangs co-ossified with their containing sockets. A constant succes-
sion of teeth in this manner took place during the life of the Mosasaurus.

The remains of the New Jersey Mosasaurus have been referred to a species
named M. Mitchilli, in honor of Dr. S. L. Mitchill, of New York, who first
directed attention to their existence in this country in 1818. A few fossils,
apparently of the same species, have been found in North and South Carolina.
Remains of Mosasaurus, probably of a different species from the former, have
been discovered on the Upper Missouri, of which a notice was first given by Dr.
R. Harlan, in 1834. The greater part of a skeleton was subsequently found
by Major O’Fallon, imbedded in a rock in the vicinity of Big Bend, and was
presented by him to Maximillian, Prince of Wied, who was then travelling in
western America. The prince had the specimen conveyed to Europe and pre-
sented to the Academy of Naturalists at Bonn, in the museum of which it is
now preserved. Dr. Goldfuss, who described the specimen, estimated the num-
ber of vertebree to have been one hundred and fifty-seven. We have but little
certain knowledge of the bones of the limbs of Mosasaurus; but the more
authentic specimens which have been found go to show that the animal was
provided with fins adapted to swimming.

Remains apparently of a comparatively small species of Mosasaurus, or of
a closely allied genus, have been discovered in the cretaceous formations of
Alabama and Mississippi.

Some isolated vertebre of large size, from the green-sand of New Jersey, are
supposed by Professor Owen, of London, to indicate a saurian distinct from
Mosasaurus, though allied to it, to which he has given the name of Macrosaurus
levis. Similar vertebree have been found in North Carolina. <A long, narrow,
conical tooth crown, with the surfaces subdivided into planes, from the green-
sand of Burlington county, New Jersey, and an exactly similar one from the
shores of Cape Fear river, North Carolina, indicate another reptile, probably
allied to Mosasaurus, which have been named Polygonodon vetus.

Perhaps the most extraordinary reptile yet discovered in the American creta-
ceous formations is an enormous herbivorous lizard, the Hadrosaurus Foulki.
A gentleman of Philadelphia, W. Parker Foulke, while passing the warm season
CRETACEOUS REPTILES OF THE UNITED STATES. 71

of 1858 in the pleasant little village of Haddonfield, Camden county, New
Jersey, was informed by a neighbor, Mr. J. E. Hopkins, that som2 remarkable
bones of huge size had been discovered while digging marl upon his farm about
twenty years previously. The specimens first found had been all given away
or lost. Under the expectation of finding others, Mr. Foulke employed men
to dig in the position of the old excavation, which was in a ravine through
which flowed a branch of Cooper’s creek. At the depth of nine feet numerous
bones were found in a bed of tenacious blue clay, mingled with a multitude of
fossil shells. The bones, though fractured, were otherwise well preserved, and
exhibited no appearance of being water-rolled. Indeed, the most delicate of the
accompanying shells, though decomposed, had preserved their forms so per-
fectly that it was evident the animal remains had originally rested on the soft
mud at the bottom cf a quiet sea. The bones which were obtained consisted
of twenty-eight vertebra, part of the pelvis, most of the bones of the left fore
and hinder extremities, some small fragments of jaws, and nine teeth.

The vertebrze of the neck and forepart of the dorsal region have their bodies
convex in front and concave behind, the reverse of the condition in the living
crocodiles, and in the extinct Mosasaurus. The degree of convexity and con-
cavity declines in the posterior dorsal vertebra, and in the vertebree of the loins
and tail the bodies are biconcave. The anterior caudal vertebree are the largest
of the spinal column, though not so long as most of the others. A perfect speci-
men indicates the tail to have been of enormous size—near the root about a foot
and a half in vertical diameter, and eight inches transversely. The humerus or
arm: bone is twenty-two and a half inches long, and nearly seven inches broad
at the upper part. ‘The bones of the forearm have about the same length. The
hones of the hinder extremity are especially remarkable for their huge propor-
tions, whether viewed independently or in relation with those of the fore ex-
tremity. The femur, or thigh-bone, is forty-one inches anda half long and
fifteen inches in circumference near the middle. The tibia, or shin-bone, is over
three feet long, and nearly a foot in circumference about the middle. Both the
. humerus and femur contain large medullary cavities.

The remains of Hadrosaurus exhibit a close relationship of the reptile with
the Jguanodon, a lizard of equally huge proportions and like habits, discovered
by Dr. Mantell in the next oldest formation to the cretaceous, known as the
wealden of Europe. The specimens of the Iguanodon Mantelli now form part
of the magnificent collection of the British Museum.

Hadrosaurus and Iguanodon, in proportions and habits, held the same rela-
tionship with other great extinct lizards that the bulky herbivorous pachy.
derms do among ordinary mammals. They might be viewed as the oxen
among the tigers, and insect eaters of lizards.

Among living lizards, the Iguanas of South America, and the marine
Amblyrhynchus of the Galipagos islands, are th only ones which are vege-
table feeders, and in these the sharp, serrated teeth are only adapted to cutting
the softer kinds, such as fruits, flowers, sea-weed, &c., and are not at all fit for
mastication or grinding the food,
72 ARTICLES REFERRED TO IN THE SECRETARY'S REPORT.

When Dr. Mantell first exhibited teeth of the Iguanodon, no one would
believe that they belonged to a reptile, and even Cuvier pronounced a worn
specimen to be the tooth of a rhinoceros.

The teeth of Hadrosaurus have the same general constitution as those of
Iguanodon, being adapted to the trituration of vegetable food. They are
exceedingly small in relation with the size of the animal, measuring only a
little over an inch in length, but they were numerous, and appear to have been
arranged so closely together as to form a continuous pavement at the border of
the jaws, well adapted to the crushing and comminution of vegetable sub-
stances. As the tecth in use were worn away, they were incessantly followed
by others, which also appear to have been arranged in close apposition with
one another.

Hadrosaurus was probably an amphibious reptile. Its huge, laterally flat-
tened tail was evidently adapted to swimming. The large hollows in the
interior of the arms and thigh bones would indicate a partially terrestrial habit.
The great disproportion between the fore and back parts of the body has led
to the view that when not swimming the huge reptile supported itself in a frog-
like position, though it had an additional prop in the huge tail.

Teeth nearly like those of Hadrosaurus, but referred to another reptile,
named Trachodcn, have been discovered by Dr. F. V. Hayden, in a formation
of unascertained age, though probably cretaceous, in the bad lands of the
Judith river, a tributary of the Missouri, near its source.

Other huge bones of reptiles have been discovered in the New Jersey green-
sand, of uncertain reference, but most probably of species allied to Hadrosaurus.
Several bones, from Burlington county, of a reptile of comparatively small size
with the latter, though also probably allied to it, are remarkable for their hol-
lowness, almost approaching in this respect the condition of the bones of birds.
They have been referred to a genus under the name of Celosaurus, the term
referring to the hollowness of the skeleton.

Several teeth of a large reptile, discovered in a eretaceous formation near
Bladensburg, Maryland, have been referred by Dr. Johnson, of Baltimore, to a
peculiar genus, under the name of Astrodon.

A large tooth, mingled with a number of others of sharks, from the green-
sand of Mullica Hill, Lancaster county, New J ersey, indicates a carnivorous
reptile, to which the name of Tomodon horrificus is applied. 'The tooth re-
sembles a large shark tooth, being broad, flattened conical, with sharp, cutting
borders minutely serrated. The original possessor of the tooth was no doubt
a fierce and sanguinary cotemporary of the peaceful, herb-eating Hadrosaurus.

Of turtles, the green-sand of New Jersey has furnished the fossil remains of
a number of genera and species. The fossils are, however, generally in a very
imperfect state, usually consisting of fragments of a few plates of the bony
shell. ‘The remains observed by the author appear to indicate eight species
of five genera. Of these, two are referred to Chelone, three to Emys, one to
Platemys, one to Trionyzx, and one to a peculiar genus—Bothremys. The latter
is rematkable from the jaws being provided with large funnel shaped pits, one

CRETACEOUS REPTILES OF THE UNITED STATES. 3

on each side, those of the upper jaw being opposed ,to the lower ones. It is
difficult to conjecture the use of these pits, though the author has suspected
that probably these sprung from the tooth-like processes of the horny beaks
with which the jaws of turtles are furnished. A skull, the only part yet dis-
covered which is distinctly referrible to the genus, was obtained from the green-
sand near Barnsboro’, Gloucester county, New Jersey. It bears a resemblance,
among living turtles, most nearly to the great Amazon turtle, Podocnemys.
The species is named Bothremys Cookii, in honor of Professor George H.
Cook, of Rutger’s college, New Brunswick, New Jersey, who greatly assisted
the author in procuring gpecimens for his examination, which form part of the
raaterial of the memoir.

Prof. JoserpH Henry, LL.D.,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

EXCHANGES AND TRANSPORTATION.

The distribution of publications of the year included volume xiii of the
Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, of 558 pages and seven plates;
volume v of Miscellaneous Collections, of 774 pages; and the Annual Report
of the Institution for 1862, of 450 pages ; making an aggregate of 1,782 pages
and seven plates.

As heretofore, the packages transmitted and received included all the ex-
changes between the learned institutions and men of science generally of
America and other parts of the world, the details of which are shown in the
accompanying tables. As in previous years, the Institution has to make its
grateful acknowledgments for services rendered in connexion with these opera-
tions by the Cunard, the Bremen, the Hamburg, and the Pacific Mail Steam-
ship lines; the Panama Railroad Company, the Adams Express Company,
the Hudson’s Bay Company, &e. Privileges similar to those granted heretofore
by the Adams Express Company have, during the year, been also extended
by the Harnden and the American Express Companies.

To Messrs. Hiram Barney and Simeon Draper, collectors of the port of New
York, and Mr. George Hillier, of the custom-house ; and to Mr. Samuel Hub-
bard, of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, in San Francisco, the Institu-
tion continues to be under many obligations for important aid extended in con-
nexion with its system of exchanges and transportation. Its thanks are also
due to Messrs. F. Probst & Co. of New York, and their correspondents in
Vera Cruz, Messrs. Lefimann and Gutheil, for valuable assistance in the ex-
changes with Mexico.

The regular foreign agents of the Institution—Dr. Felix Fligel, of Leipsic;
Messrs. Gustave Bossange & Co., of Paris; Mr. William Wesley, of London;
and Mr. Frederick Miiller, of Amsterdam—have continued to discharge their
duties to the full satisfaction of the Institution. |

MUSEUM AND COLLECTIONS.

Although the additions to the collections have not been as numerous as in
some preceding years, their value has been considerable, as consisting princi-
pally of new material from comparatively little known portions of America.
A detailed list of donations and additions to the museum will be found at the
end of the present report. The following are the principal regions and sources
from which collections have been received. i

Arctic America.—Very large collections of mammals, birds, eggs, &c., made
in the northern parts of British America during 1863 and 1864, and filling
29 cases, reached Fort Garry iu September last, and were forwarded to St. Paul,
but arrived there after navigation had closed. ‘They are now on their way to
Washington by wagon and railroad, and are expected to arrive in a few weeks.
They embrace many species not previously received from the north, and were
collected principally by Messrs. MacFarlane, Lockhart, Jones, Sibbiston, Gau-
det, Flett, Reid, Mactavish, Gunn, &c., already well known from repeated men-
tion in previous reports. A full account of the collection will, it is hoped, be
presented in the report for 1865.

82 REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

From Labrador small but interesting and instructive collections of birds, with
some eges, were received from Mr. Henry Connolly and Mr. B. Smith; and
from Moose Factory, from Mr. John MacKenzie, all of the Hudson’s Bay service.

Pacific coast of the United Staies—My. J. G. Swan, of Puget sound, has
continued his important transmissions illustrating the zodlogy and ethnology of
that region. Professor Whitney, of the geological-survey of California, has
also sent tothe Institution many specimens collected by Dr. J. G. Cooper,
zodlogist of the survey, to be identified by comparison with the Smithsonian
types.

Interior region of the United States—Assistant Surgeon Elliot Coues and
Acting Assistant Surgeon J. A. Beers, having been ordered to report to the
military commander of New Mexico for duty, left early in the spring for Santa
¥é. During their journey they made valuable collections of birds, which were
received in good condition. On reaching Santa Fé, Dr. Coues was ordered to
Fort Whipple, near Prescott, the newly established capital of Arizona, which
he reached in August, and where he has been diligently engaged, in the inter-
vals of his official duties, in exploring the natural history of that interesting
and little-known region. The results of his labors up to the beginning of No-
vember, filling three boxes, have reached San Francisco, and have been ship-
ped to the Institution, where they may be expected shortly to arrive. Dr. Beers
has been stationed at Fort: Goodwin, on the Gila, and is also making collections
there, none of which, however. have yet been received.

In April last, Acting Assistant Surgeon R. Hitz left Washington for Fort
Laramie, to serve as surgeon to a projected western expedition from that post,
under Colonel Collins. During his term of service. Dr. Hitz made large col-
lections of specimens, principally on Laramie Peak, which have not yet arrived,
owing to the freezing up, in the Missouri river, of the steamboat upon which
they had been shipped.

In May last, Captain John Feilner, 1st United States cavalry, was detailed
to accompany the expedition of General Sully, fitted out to control the Sioux
Indians of the Upper Missouri, and during his stay at Sioux City, in the month
of May, collected and forwarded a valuable collection of birds. He then pro-
ceeded to Fort Rice, a new post at the mouth of Cannon-ball river, and after-
wards started with the command on the westward expedition. On the 30th of
June, when about 100 miles from Fort Rice, Captain Feilner was ambushed
by hostile Indians and mortally wounded, surviving only afew hours. In this
untimely death of Captain Feilner the Institution loses one of its most valued
correspondents. Many previous Reports bear testimony to the services he has
rendered to science by his numerous collections of specimens in natural history,
prepared with unusual skill, and made in the—till then—unknown regions
about Fort Crook, California.

Eastern United States —Extensive collections of eggs have been received
from Dr. William Wood, of Connecticut, Mr. J. W. Tolman, of Illinois, and
Dr. Hoy, of Wisconsin. Dr. I’. V. Hayden and Dr. Craven have furnished
series illustrating the invertebrate fauna of the coast of South Carolina. Cap-
tain William Holden, of the quartermaster’s department, supplied a large num-
ber of serpents and other reptiles from the vicinity of Newbern, North Carolina.

Meaico—The most important collections received from Mexico, during the
year, have been those of Mr. Xantus. Mention was made in a previous report
of his operations about Colima and Manzanillo and vicinity, and of specimens
received from him. ‘The remainder of the collections of 1863 were received in
1864, and filled 28 boxes, (two others still deficient,) consisting of a general
assortment of the land and aquatic animals, numerous minerals, and a few
plants of the region investigated, and embracing much that is new to science.

These collections were due early in the year, but were detained several
months in Manzanillo by the blockade of the port by the French; and were

finally brought to Panama on the United States steamer Narragansett, and de-
livered to the Panama Railroad Company, by the kindness of Commander 8. E.
Woodworth, United States navy.

Several collections of birds and their eggs from the vicinity of Mazatlan
have been presented by Colonel A. J. Grayson, an old correspondent of the
Institution. These have provedof muchinterest, as showing an extension nortk-
ward, along the coast, of the Central American fauna, of much greater extent
than formerly supposed. Colonel Grayson is at present engaged in exploring
the ornithology of the large islands, Three Marias, &c., off the coast of Mexico,
and will doubtless make some interesting discoveries.

Additional collections of birds and other animals, as well as of plants, have
been received from Dr. Charles Sartorius, of Mirador, a gentleman to whom the
Institution already owes so much material relative to the natural history of
Mexico. Collections of birds, mammals and reptiles, in continuation of pre-
vious ones, have also been presented by Dr. Sumichrast, of Orizaba.

Dr. H. Berendt, long resident in Tabasco, visited the United States early in
the year, bringing with him valuable collections of natural history for the In-
stitution. These consisted principally of reptiles, among them a complete
series of the Chelonia, found near ‘Tabasco.

At the present time, an extensive exploration of the physical and natural
history of Yucatan is in progress, of which the Institution expects some of the
results. It is under the direction of Seftor Salazar y Llarregui, well known as
former Mexican commissioner of the United States and Mexican boundary
survey. Dr. Arthur Schott, of whom frequent mention has been made in pre-
vious reports, as naturalist of the United States and Mexican boundary survey,
Lieutenant Michler’s survey of the Atrato river, &c., has been attached, in a
similar capacity, to the Yucatan survey.

Central America—An extensive and most important series of birds of Gua-
temala has been received from Mr. Osbert Salvin, of London, types of the
report made on the Guatemalan collections by himself and Mr. F. Godman.
A valuable collection of Costa Rican birds has keen received from Dr. A. von
Frantzius, already referred to in previous reports; and many specimens, also,
from Mr. J. Carmiol; the two series embracing an unusual proportion of new
and rare species.

From Captain J. M. Dow additional collections of birds of the coast region
of Central America have been received ; and several collections made by Mr.
Frederick Hicks have been submitted to my examination.

South America —Specimens of birds from Bogota have been presented by
Mr. J. Krider, Mr. J. Akhurst, and Mr. J. H. Roome. Additional cellections
of birds of Ecuador, of much value, have been received from Hen. J. B.
Buckalew and Prof. W. Jameson; and, also, quite 2 number from Mr. Akhurst.
A collection of birds from the vicinity*of La Paz, Bolivia, made and presented
by Hon. D. K. Cartter, has proved of the greatest interest, embracing, among
other novelties, two new hummingbirds. A collection of woods from Surinans
has been received from Mr. Henry Sawyer.

West Indies —Additional collections from Mr. W.'T. March, of Jamaica, and
from Mr. Charles Wright, Mr. N. H. Bishop, and Dr. F. Gundlach, of Cuba,
have tended to make the Smithsonian series of birds from these islands still
more complete than heretofore. A valuable collection of shells of Jamaica has
also been received from Mr. March, and of Cuba from Mr. Wright.

A series of birds of Nassau, New Providence, presented by Lieutenant Fitz-
gerald, of the British army, included several species new to the collection.

In addition to the collections of birds referred to above, as received from
particular regions, Mr. Ed. Verreaux, of Paris, has presented, through the
instrumentality of Mr. Jules P. Verreaux, the eminent ornithologist, a large
number of species from Mexico, Central and South America, embracing many
84 REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

valuable types, and of inestimable service in prosecuting the study of Middle
and South American birds, only equalled in this respect by the donations of
Mr. Salvin.

As might be expected from the plan of operations of the Institution, the
collections received from Europe and the rest of the Old World, during the year,
are much inferior in number and extent to those from America. Among these,
however, should be especially mentioned a series of Scandinavian Ptarmigans
and of rare northern birds, from Prof, ©. Sundevall, of Stockholm; and of rare
European eges, from the Royal Artillery Institution, of Woolwich; Prof. Hai-
dinger and Prof. Hérnes, on the part of the K. K. Geologische Reichsanstalt, in
eonjunction with the Imperial Mineralogical Museum of Vienna, have presented
an extensive series of fossils of the tertiary basin of Vienna. The K. Ober-
Bergamt, of Breslau, has contributed a very useful series of minerals and mining
products, illustrating the metallurgy of the royal mining establishment of Silesia.

INVESTIGATION, IDENTIFICATION, AND ENTERING OF COLLECTIONS.

Steady progress has been made, during the year, in the determination and
labelling of the collections of the Institution, and the setting aside of the
duplicates, by the different gentlemen to whom specimens have been intrusted
for the purpose. I have, myself, been engaged, at moments not otherwise
occupied, in reviewing the entire collection of birds of America, both north
and south, in charge of the Institution, and in preparing a descriptive catalogue
for publication in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. Of this review
about one hundred and fifty pages have been printed, and an additional por-
tion is in press. I am indebted to several gentlemen for important aid in ear-
rying out this undertaking, by the loan of specimens necessary for comparison ;
especially to Mr. George N. Lawrence, of New York; Mr. John Cassin, of
Philadelphia; Dr. Samuel Cabot, jr., of Boston; and Messrs. Edward and
Alfred Newton and Mr. O. Salvin, of England.

Mr. W. S. Morgan, of Washington, has been systematically engaged in
making a series of drawings of all the varieties of authenticated species of
North American eggs in the collection, to be used in preparing the illustrations
to Dr. Brewer’s work on North American Odlogy.

The following table shows the amount of work done, during the year, in the
way of registering the collections.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 85

If to the above we add the mollusea catalogued, by Mr. Carpenter, the record
of which, filling an entire volume, is still in his hands, it will bring the total
number of entries fully up to 100,000. As in all departments, excepting those
of mammals, birds, and osteology, each entry may include a large number of
specimens, it is a fair allowance to estimate an average throughout of five te
each number, making half a million of objects catalogued (probably many
more) and marked by permanent labels or figures. 'The average number of
entries for the twelve years during which the system has been continued will
thus exceed 8,000.

DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES.

A very large number of specimens have been issued from the duplicate stores
of the Institution, in 1864, both to public museums at home and abroad, and
to gentlemen requiring them for special investigations. The following table
exhibits the statistics of distribution as far as they could be reduced te

The estimate, although somewhat approximate, is under the true amount
of material distributed, rather than in excess. Mvery specimen included in it
was carefully and authentically labelled before being issued. Of the birds
referred to, 360 were mounted duplicates of the United States Exploring Hx-
pedition, supplied to the Boston Society of Natural History and the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE MUSEUM.

The specimens exhibited in the museum are all, apparently, in good condi-
tion, free from insects, and nearly all properly identified and labelled. The
series of fishes has been removed from the rooms under the art-gallery and
placed in the northwest gallery of the museum hall, arranged for their recep-
tion. A series of casts of interesting Mexican masks and other antiquities, from
originals in the museum of the American Philosophical Society, has been
placed in the eastern end of the northeast gallery.

A large portion of the collections of the exploring expedision and Western
American shells, intrusted to Mr. Carpenter for determination, has been re-
turned by him, but they remain in the cases in which they arrived until the
rest shall have been received, by request of Mr. Carpenter.

From the foregoing it will be seen that the whole ineome during the year
1864 was $34,666 14, and that the expenditures during the same period were
$37,535 96, exhibiting for the first time, in the account of the current opera-
tions, an excess of the latter over the former of $2,869 82.

According to the statement of the Secretary, the cause of this excess of the
expenditure was the constant increase in prices of all the articles used in the
operations of the Institution, particularly in printing and paper, and the pur-
chase of gold to defray the expense of the foreign agencies.

To meet contingencies of this kind, however, as well as to carry on all the
operations for cash, there had been accumulated in the hands of the treasurer at
the beginning of the year the sum of $32,353 90. The unexpended balance,
therefore, now in the hands of the treasurer is $29,484 08.

The appropriation by Congress for the preservation of the collections of the
exploring and surveying expeditions of the United States has been expended
as heretofore, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in assisting to
pay the expenses of extra assistants in the museum, and the cost of arranging
and preserving the specimens. The articles intrusted to the care of the Insti-
tution by government are in good condition, and the distribution of the duplicate
specimens belonging to government, as well as those of the Institution, has been
industriously prosecuted during the year.

From the examination made by the committee it appears that the affairs of
the Institution are in a prosperous condition; that all the operations have been

continued with unabated energy ; that notwithstanding the depreciation of the
value of the income, the expenditures have but little exceeded the current re-
ceipts, and that provision had been made even for this contingency by the pre-
vious accumulations in the hands of the treasurer.

The Executive Committee are informed by the Secretary that the remainder
of the legacy of Smithson, amounting to about $26,000, has been received in
coin, and deposited with the Treasurer of the United States.

In conclusion, it may be stated that the whole amount of the Smithsonian
fund, including the original legacy and the additions which have since been
made to it, together with the balance in the hands of the treasurer, and the State
stocks estimated at their present market value, amounts to about $690,000.

The committee agree with the Secretary in opinion that, as far as possible, the
active operations of the Institution should be continued, and the curtailments
rendered necessary by the depreciation of the currency be made in expenditures
for those objects which can most readily be postponed. For the year 1865 the
same estimates are submitted as those for 1864, with such diminution as the
Secretary may deem it advisable to make.

The committee have carefully examined the accounts of the Institution and
the books as posted by Mr. Randolph for the past year, and find them to be
correct.

Respectfully submitted.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

OF

PER BOAR: Di Oak Ree Nase

WASHINGTON, January 9, 1865.

A special meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day at 7} o’clock
p: m. in the hall of the Institution. Present: Hon. H. Hamlin, Hon. 5S. P.
Chase, Hon. L. Trumbull, Hon. G. Davis, Hon. 8. S. Cox, Hon. J. W. Patter-
son, Professor L. Agassiz, and the Secretary, Professor Henry.

Mr. Hamlin was called to the chair. is

The Secretary stated that this meeting had been called in accordance with
a provision of the law of Congress authorizing a meeting at any time, at the
request of three members of the Board. That the objects of this meeting were—

First. To announee officially the death of Chief Justice Taney and General
Totten, both members of the Board from the beginning of the Institution, and
who had ever evinced a lively interest in its prosperity, and had faithfully dis-
charged their duties as guardians of the trust.

Second. To elect a Chancellor or President of the Board in place of Chief
Justice Taney.

Third. To consider the disposition to be made of the remainder of the legacy
of Smithson, which was now deposited with Messrs. Peabody & Co., of London,
subject to the order of the Institution; and,

Fourth. To consider the report of the committee appointed at the last session
of the Board, relative to the suggestions of Professor Agassiz as to the separate
maintenance of the museum, &c.

On motion of Mr. Cox, it was resolved that the proper expression of sympathy
be tendered to the families of the Regents whose deaths have been announced,
and that provision be made for the preparation of an account of their lives and
labors for the annual report to Congress.

On motion of Mr. Cox, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase was unanimously
elected Chancellor of the Institution.

On motion of Mr. Chase, the Secretary was instructed to draw the money now
in England, and to deposit it with the Treasurer of the United States.

Professor Agassiz, as chairman of the special committee, appointed at the
meeting held March 15, 1864, to report suggestions for extending the active
operations of the Institution, and for the separate maintenance of the collections,
at the expense of the government, submitted a report.*

* This report was lost in the fire, and the absence of Professor Agassiz from the country
has rendered it impossible to obtain another copy in time for insertion in this journal.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 115

The opinion was expressed by several members of the Board that the views
of Professor Agassiz were highly important, and believed to be such as were
entertained generally by the scientific men of the country, but in consideration
of the financial condition of the government, the present time was not favorable
for action in regard to them.

On motion of Mr. Trumbull, the consideration of the subject was postponed
to the annual session to be held in January, 1866.

The Secretary stated that the question had arisen at a previous meeting ‘of
the Board as to whether the interest on the Smithsonian fund, permanently in
the treasury of the United States, ought not to be paid in coin, in common with
the interest on other trust funds in charge of the government; that he had
addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury on this subject, but on
account of the large demands on the government for the prosecution of the war,
he had not pressed a decision of the question.

On motion of Mr. Chase, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to renew the application to the
Treasury Department, in behalf of the Board, for the payment of the interest
in coin.

The meeting then adjourned.

WASHINGTON, January 19, 1865.
In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, fixing the time of beginning of their annual session on the third
Wednesday of January in each year, a meeting was called for this day.
No quoruni being present, and the Secretary having stated that the book-
keeper had not yet been able to make up the annual accounts, the Board
adjourned, to meet at the call of the Secretary.

WASHINGTON, January 28, 1865.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held at 3 o’clock p. m. in the east
wing of the Smithsonian building. Present: Hon. S. P. Chase, Hon. H. Ham-
lin, Hon. L. Trumbull, Hon. J. W. Patterson, Hon. R. Wallach, Mr. Seaton,
treasurer, and Professor Henry, Secretary.

The Chancellor, Chief Justice Chase, took the chair.

The Secretary stated that the principal object of this meeting was to officially
inform the Regents that, on the afternoon of Tuesday, January 24, a fire broke
out in the roof of the main building of the Smithsonian Institution, which de-
stroyed the principal part of the contents of the rooms in the upper story of the
building and the adjoining towers. ‘The loss, however, did not include the large
library, the museum, with the government collections and those of the Institu-
tion, the duplicate specimens intended for distribution, and the meteorological
records. The accident would not, therefore, materially affect the essential opera-
tions of the Institution, which would be continued as usual.
116 PRUCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Secretary stated that, immediately after the occurrence of the accident,
he had applied to the Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton, for aid in constructing a
temporary roof to protect the building and its contents from the weather. The
Secretary of War expressed his willingness to grant this, provided the Presi-
dent gave his sanction, and the expense should be refunded to the department.
The latter was promised on the part of the Institution by the Secretary, after
consultation with the Chancellor. The President readily gave his consent to
the proposition, and General Rucker, of the Quartermaster’s Department,
furnished the materials, and detailed a large force of carpenters and laborers,
under the direction of Mr. E. Clark, to erect a temporary roof, which would be
sufficient to protect the building from storms, and would not interfere with the
construction of a permanent covering.

4 *
At the suggestion of the Chancellor, it was

Resolved, That the measures which had been taken by the Secretary be

approved.

Mr. Patterson informed the Board that the House of Representatives had
adopted, on the motion of Hon. Mr. Rice, a resolution directing the Committee
ou Publie Buildings and Grounds to inquire into the origin of the fire, the ap-
proximate loss to the government and private persons, the means necessary to
preserve the remaining portions, &c.

‘he Chancellor remarked that it would be proper that a joint committee
should be appointed, to be composed of members of the Senate, of the House of
Representatives, and of this Board, to take the whole subject into consideration.

in anticipation of this, however, it was thought advisable that a special com-
mittee should be appointed to report directly to the Board; and, on motion of
My. Wallach, it was '

Resolved, 'That a committee be appointed to inquire into the origin of the fire,
to ascertain the extent and character of the loss sustained, and to make sugges-

tions as to what.measures should be adopted for the repair and improvement of
the building.

The Chancellor appointed the mover of the resolution Mr. Wallach, and the
Secretary, as the committee. ;

The Board having examined the building, adjourned, to meet on Thursday
evening at 74 o’clock p. m.

WASHINGTON, February 2, 1865.

A meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution was held
at 8 o’clock p. m. at the residence of one of the Regents, Hon. R. Wallach,
Mayor of Washington. Present: Hon. H. Hamlin, Hon. G. Davis, Hon. J.
W. Patterson, Hon. 8. 8. Cox, Hon. R. Wallach, and the Secretary, Professor

Henry, and, by invitation, Hon. J. H. Rice, chairman of the Committee on
Public Buildings of the House of Representatives.

Mr Hamlin was called to the chair.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. LEG

The minutes of the meetings held on the 9th, 19th, and 28th of January
were read and approved.

Mr. Wallach presented the report of the Executive Committee for the year 1864,
which was read and adopted.

The Secretary stated that, in accordance with the instructions of the Board;
he had renewed the inquiry to the Secretary of the Treasury whether the interest
of the Smithsonian fund ought not to be paid in coin or its equivalent, but had
not yet received a reply, it having been referred to the Solicitor of the Treasury
for a legal opinion. ;

On motion of Mr. Davis, it was

Resolved, That if the Secretary of the Institution should ascertain that the
legal opinion of the Solicitor would be adverse to the application, that he should
request the Secretary of the Treasury to submit the question to Congress for
its action. | ,

Professor Henry presented the question as to the disposition of the residuary
legacy of Smithson which had been received from England, and was now ons
deposit with the Treasurer of the United States.

On motion of Mr. Patterson, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to invest the money now on de-
posit with the Treasurer of the United States, derived from the residuary legacy
of James Smithson, in United States bonds bearing 7,3; per cent. interest.

Mr. Wallach presented the following report from the special committee ap-
pointed at the last meeting to inquire into the origin of the fire, &c., which was
read and adopted:

REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION RELATIVE TO THE FIRE.

The special committee appointed by the Board at its meeting on January 28,
1865, to inquire into the origin of the fire at the Smithsonian Institution, to
ascertain the extent and character of the loss sustained, and to make sugges-
tions as to what measures should be adopted for the repair and improvement
of the building, respectfully report that they have performed the duty assigned
them, so far as the time and their means of information would permit.

I.—THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE.

The testimony has been taken of all persons connected with the establish-
ment that had any knowledge of the occurrence, and a written account of the
whole is herewith submitted ; also a report from Colonel B.S. Alexander, United
States army, who superiutended the fire-prooting of the main building, of his
examination of the flues connected with the accident.

It is evident, from the concurrent testimony thus obtained, that the fire com-
menced in the southwest part of the roof of the main building in the wood-
work immediately under the slate covering, and that it was kindled by the
heated air or sparks from a sfove which had been temporarily placed in the
room immediately below. ‘The pipe of this stove had been inserted, by mistake,
into a brick furring-space resembling a flue, which opened under the rafters in-
stead of into the chimney flue, within a few inches of the latter. By whom
the hole into which the pipe was inserted was originally made is not known,
but it is remembered that a stove-pipe was put into it as far back as 1854, at the
time of the exhibition held by the Mechanics’ Institute in the building. No

fire, however, had been in this room for ten years previous to Monday, 15th
January, when the mechanist and carpenter of the Institution were engaged,
with several other of the employés, in rearranging the pictures of the gallery,
the weather at the time being unusually cold. These persons, for temporary
convenience, set up the stove above mentioned, intending to remove it as soon
as their task was finished. <A coal fire, kindled with wood, had been burning
in this stove for eight days previous to the conflagration, yet it appears from the
testimony that no evidence of combustion was observed by a person who passed
through the loft six hours before the breaking out of the flames. It is probable,
however, that the wood had been undergoing a process of charring for several
days. :

On account of the very expensive style of architecture selected for the build-
ing, and the limited means at the command of the Board, the pfan had been at
first adopted of finishing the interior of the whole edifice with wood and plaster.
A large portion, however, of the interior woodwork of the main building, after
the roof and exterior had been finished, gave way and fell; whereupon the Re-
gents ordered the removal of the woodwork and its place to be supplied with
incombustible materials. ‘Thus the main building was rendered fire-proof, with
the exception of the supports of the roof, which being covered with slate was
assumed to be safe. The only danger of the occurrence of fire was supposed
to exist in the two wings and the towers, and to guard against this contingency
especial precautions were constantly observed, viz: 1. No smoking was_al-
lowed in any part of the building at any time. 2. No lights were allowed to
be carried from one part of the building to another except in lanterns. 3.
Three coils of large hose were depesited, ready for use, one in the upper story
and the other two on the first floor of the building ; and there were water-pipes
in the basement with faucets. 4. Barrels and buckets, kept constantly filled
with water, were placed at different points of the building. 5. The rule was
observed of cleaning the flues every autumn before the commencement of fires.
6. A watchman was employed each night, who made every hour the rounds of
all the rooms in the building, giving special attention to those in which fire had
been kindled during the day, including the apartments occupied by the family
of the Secretary.

These precautions, however, as it has proved, were insufficient—the fire hav-
ing occurred at a point where no danger was apprehended, and to which access
could with difficulty be obtained.

1].—THE CHARACTER AND EXTENT OF THE LOSS SUSTAINED.

The loss to the Institution was as follows:

1. The contents of the Secretary’s office, consisting of the official, scientific, and
miscellaneous correspondence, embracing 35,000 pages of copied letters which
had been sent, at least 30,000 of which were the composition of the Secretary,
and 50,000 pages of letters received by the Institution. Here, moreover, were
lost the receipts for publications and specimens; reports on various subjects
which have been referred to the Institution; the records of experiments
instituted by the Secretary for the government; four manuscripts of original
investigations, which had been adopted by the Institution for publication;
the manuscript material of the report of the Secretary for 1864; a large number
of papers and scientific notes of the Secretary; a series of diaries and memo-
randum books, and a duplicate set of account books, prepared during the last
twelve years, with great labor, by Mr. Rhees, the chief clerk; also, about one
hundred volumes of valuable works kept at hand for constant reference.

2. In the apparatus room, the large collection of scientific instruments, in-
cluding the donation of the late Dr. Hare.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS 119

3. A part of the contents of the Regents’ room, including the personal effects
of Smithson, with the exception of his portrait and library.

4. The contents of the rooms in the towers, including the meteorological
instruments, the workshop, containing a lathe and a large number of valuable
tools, nearly all the stock on hand of the duplicate copies of the annual reports,
and many other public documents and books intended for distribution to libra-
ries, as well as a quantity of stationery, hardware, &c.

5. The wood-cuts of the illustrations contained in the Smithsonian publi-
cations.

The loss to other parties was as follows :

1st. The contents of what was called the Picture Gallery, viz: a. About two
hundred portraits, nearly all of life size, painted and principally owned by Mr.
J. M. Stanley, formerly of this city, and now of Detroit, Michigan, and which
were on deposit in the institution. 6. A number of half-size Indian portraits,
painted by Mr. King for the government. c. A copy, in Carrera marble, of the
antique statue known as the ‘ Dying Gladiator,” by John Gott, and owned by
Mr. J. C. McGuire, of this city.

2. A number of surveying instruments belonging to the government.

3. The clothing, books, and private effects of several of the persons connected
with the Institution, and of those engaged in scientific studies.

4. The library removed from Beaufort, South Carolina, by the army, and
also that of Bishop Johns, from Fairfax Theological Seminary, given in charge
to the Institution by the Secretary of War for safe-keeping, which libraries were
stored in an upper room in the south tower.

Independent of injury to the building, the‘loss to the Institution, as far as it
may be estimated and can be restored by money, may be stated at about $20,000,
and to individuals $26,000, viz: To Mr. J. M. Stanley, $20,000; Mr. J.C.
McGuire, $1,000; Professor Joseph Henry, $1,500; Mr. W. J. Rhees, $1,200;
Mr. W. DeBeust, $1,300; and all others, $1,000.

Although the loss which the Institution and individuals have sustained is
much to be regretted, yet it is a source of consolation that by far the greater ~
part of the valuable contents of the building have escaped without injury. The
valuable library of the Institution, the most extensive, in regard to the transac-
tions of learned societies and scientific books, in this country; the museum, in-
cluding the collection of the exploring expedition and those of the Institution ;
the large stock of many thousand duplicate specimens for. distribution to all
parts of the world; the records of the museum; a large portion of the corre-
spondence relative to natural history; nearly all the records of meteorological
observations which have been accumulated during the last fifteen years; the
sets of Smithsonian publications (except the annual reports) which have been
reserved to supply new institutions, and the stereotype plates of all the works
which have been published during the last four or five years, have been saved.
All the original vouchers of the payments made by the Institution, the ledger
in which they were posted, and the daybook from 1858, were also preserved,
having been deposited in a safe in the Regents’ room. 'The contents of the con-
necting range between the library and the museum are uninjured; this includes
a series of plaster casts and portraits of distinguished men, among the latter a
life-size portrait of Guizot, by Healy; an original full-length figure of Wash-
ington, by the elder Peale; and also a valuable series of rare engravings illus-
trative of the history of the art, purchased from the Hon. George P. Marsh.

All the important acts of the Regents from the beginning, and an account of
the operations of the Institution, having been published from year to year in the |
several reports to Congress, a continued record of the history of the establish-
ment from the beginning is, therefore, still in existence. As these reports have
been widely distributed, they are generally accessible to the public.

The burning of the roof of the building can scarcely in itself be considered
120 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

a calamity, since it probably would have occurred at some future time when a
much larger‘accumulation of valuable articles might have been destroyed, and
since the arrangement of the building can now be improved, and the repairs
made with fire-proof materials. ‘The fire-proofing, as far as it was carried, was
well done, and it is to this circumstance that the preservation of the most valu-
able objects of the establishment is due.

IIl.—SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE.
)

There can be no hesitation in adopting the conclusion that steps should be
immediately taken not only to repair the injury, but to improve the condition of
the building.

1. The main edifice should be provided with a metallic roof.

2. For the wooden conical terminations of the towers should be substituted
metallic coverings.

3. All valuable articles belonging to the Institution or deposited in it, including
the library, should be placed in the main building, which should be cut off from
the wings by iron doors. '

4. Provision should be made for a thorough heating of the whole building by

steam or hot water.

5. Suggestions should be requested from competent architects and engineers

as to the work to be done, and those which are adopted should be embodied in
working plans and drawings.

6. A building committee of the Board should be appointed to have charge of
the work.

No very exact estimate can as yet be made as to the cost of the repairs, &c.,
for it has not been possible, without erecting a scaffolding, to determine whether
it will be necessary to take down the high northern tower. Colonel Alexander,
of the engineer corps, however, has informed the committee that he thinks
$100,000 will be required to make the necessary repairs and improvements.

The committee cannot conclude without adding that, in their opinion, the
occurrence of the fire ought not to be allowed to interfere with the active ope-
rations of the Institution, on which essentially depends the reputation it has
established throughout the world, and its efficiency as an instrument for “ the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” ‘T’o the support and exten-
sion of these operations, therefore, the annual interest from the original fund
should, as far as possible, continue as heretofore to be conscientiously applied.

Respectfully submitted :
RICHARD WALLACH,
JOSEPH HENRY,
Special Committee.
WASHINGTON, February, 1865.

The question was then discussed as to the measures to be taken for procuring
the means for the repair and improvement of the building; and the Regents
present connected with Congress, as well as Hon. Mr. Rice, expressed the
opinion that it was probable an appropriation would be made by Congress for
the purpose, without opposition.

On motion of Mr. Cox, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary prepare a statement of the amount necessary to
reconstruct the building; the legislation necessary to place the residuary legacy
of Smithson, with the original amount, permanently in the treasury of the
United States; and the action requisite to secure the payment ef the interest on
the fund in coin, to be furnished to the joint committee of Congress which has
been appointed with reference to the Smithsonian Institution.

WEDNESDAY, March 1, 1865.

A meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution was held
this day in the room of the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
at the United States Capitol, at 10 o’clock a,m. Present: Hon. L. Trumbull,
Hon. G. Davis, Hon. 8. S. Cox, Hon. J. W. Patterson, Hon. R. Wallach, and
the Secretary, Professor Henry.

The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.

In the absence of the Chancellor, Mr. Trumbull was called to the chair.

The Secretary announced the election of General Richard Delafield, United
States army, by joint resolution of the United States Senate and House of
Representatives, as a Regent for the term of six years, to fill the vacancy ocea-
sioned by the death of General Totten.

The Secretary stated that intelligence had recently been received of the sud-
den death of the Hon. Witutam L, Dayton, one of the Regents, while repre-
senting our government in France; that, although Mr. Dayton had not been
able to be present at the meetings of the Board, he had rendered good services
to the Institution by attention to its interests abroad.

On motion of Mr. Cox, it was

Resolved, That the Hon. J. W. Patterson be requested to prepare a eulogy
on Mr. Dayton; that Hon. Henry Winter Davis be requested to prepare a
eulogy on Chief Justice Taney; and Professor Henry one on General Totten,
to be presented at the next meeting of the Board.

The Secretary mentioned the death of Mr. John Varden, for many years the
curator of the government museum while it was in the Patent Office, and who,
since its removal to the Institution, had assisted in the care of the specimens.
He was a very worthy citizen, and faithfully discharged his duties in connexion
with this establishment.

The Secretary also stated that one of the employés, John Connor, who had
been connected with the Institution for upwards of fifteen years, died suddenly
122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS

last summer, leaving a family of daughters in a destitute condition; that he had
given the widow permission to sell articles of refreshment, exclusive of intox-
icating liquors, to the visitors of the museum, and that he thought, in considera-
tion of the long and faithful service of the deceased, the expenses of his funeral
should be paid from the Smithsonian fund.

On motion of Mr. Wallach, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to pay the funeral expenses of
John Connor.

On motion of Mr. Patterson, the vacancy in the Executive Committee was
filled by the election of General Delafield.

On motion of Mr. Trumbull, it was

Resolved, That the annual salary of the Secretary of the Institution be in-
creased one thousand dollars, that of the Assistant Secretary five hundred dol-

lars, and of the Chief Clerk three hundred and fifty dollars, and that the said
increase take effect from the Ist of January, 1865. F
The Secretary stated what measures had been taken in regard to the preser-
vation of the Smithsonian building, and that Mr. A. Cluss, architect, had been
employed to prepare plans and estimates.
On motion of Mr. Cox, it was

Resolved, That the whole subject of the repairs and reconstruction of the
building, and the disposal of the stocks held by the Institution, be intrusted to
the Chancellor, Secretary, and the Executive Committee.

The Board then adjourned sine die.

MEMOIR OF DELAMBRE.,

BY JOSEPH FOURIER, PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES:

’
TRANSLATED FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BY C. A. ALEXANDER,

To have acquired, from his early youth, a familiar knowledge of the great
works of antiquity, and of the languages and literature of modern times; to
have dedicated himself to the study of the heavens, and identified his name
with an enterprise of wide renown and eminent utility; to have written with
ability the history of ancient science, as well as of the most recent discoveries ;
and with these proofs of mental superiority to have united the noblest qualities
of the heart—in these sentences may be summed up the entire life of the dis-
tinguished man whose character and labors I propose to retrace. Few will fail,
in the traits thus given, to recognize Delambre, or to feel in the review a re-
newal of the regrets occasioned by his recent loss.

Delambre was born at Amiens, the 19th of September, 1749. The abbé
Delille, a distinguished professor of letters in the college of that city, soon re-
cognized in his youthful pupil a union of the gentlest manners with surprising
powers of memory and an early familiarity with the ancient languages. In
developing these first germs of talent and taste, the abbé succeeded in inspiring
a passion for continued and unremitting application, the indispensable prerequi-
site of all permanent success. A friendship was thus cemented between these
two celebrated individuals which continued to the end, with equal disinterested-
ness and constancy on the part of both.

To continue in the capital a course of study thus auspiciously commenced
was beyond the means of Delambre’s family, already burdened with a ‘numerous
charge. Fortunately, however, a gratuitous scholarship had been founded at
some former period by one of the members of that family, in the University of
Paris, and being at the disposal of the city of Amiens, was now conferred on
the young Delambre. The benefaction thus reverted towards its source, nor
could a destination more just or worthy have been given it. The recipient,
already digtinguished in every path of literary study, was destined one day to
reflect on his country the lustre of imperishable labors. While completing the
course of studies which bears the name of philosophy, he still recurred, with
unwearied assiduity, to that ancient literature which had shaped the culture of
his earlier years, and which the pupil of the abbé Delille could scarcely fail
to prosecute with brilliant success.

The time allotted to the appointment he held had passed away, and his
family, seemingly persuaded that talent ought to suffice for everything, left him
to provide for his own establishment. More than a year thus elapsed in vague
expectation, during which time the most extraordinary privations were endured,
not merely with constancy, but indifference. It would be difficult to believe,
had we not Delambre’s own word for it, to what an extent this restriction of
his expenses was carried. Absorbed in literary and historical studies, he
scarcely regarded as desirable what others would have considered indispensable.
Silently laying the foundation of his future labors, he engaged at this time in
extensive translations from the Latin, Greek, Italian, and English, and com-
menced also the study of mathematics ; the whole not with any view to profit,
126 MEMOIR OF DELAMBRE.

though he might easily have obtained it, but with the sole purpose of prefect-
ing his own knowledge. a

Living thus apart and unnoticed, yet free and happy, he knew or indulged
no passion but that for study. His time, the only property he could call his
own, was secured to him; no importunate visitor appropriated his leisure; his
talents gathered strength and expansion daily for the future service of astronomy
and letters. Solitude may thus become an inspiration for genius; it exalts
the thoughts, dissipates the desire for sudden and vulgar notoriety, and prepares
the way for works worthy to be the admiration of after ages. ;

The extraordinary merit of Delambre, the habitual mildness of his character,
the determination with which he applied himself to a revisal of his whole pre-
vious course of study, at length attracted attention. As he had beea advised
to give some years to teaching, he repaired with this purpose to Compicegne, but
remained there only a short time. ‘The resources of the capital had become
indispensab e to his plan of study, and returning to Paris, he entered on the
same course of life as before; this time, indeed, with some additional advantages
which he could no longer decline with prudence, and which soon secured him a
settled and independent position. It was now that Delambre first felt himself
irresistibly impelled to a scientific career. Without neglecting literature and
history, he explored the theories of mathematics, and applied himself assiduously
to the study of astronomy and physics. A fidelity to his purpose formed at all
times a distinctive characteristic of his genius. No one ever threw into his
pursuits more of the spirit of sequence, or traversed with more constancy the
vast field of human attainments.

When he presented himself at the college of France to hear the lessons of
Lalande, he had already studied the works of that astronomer, and had even
written commentaries upon them. Here he first attracted notice by reciting, on
an occasion which casually offered itself, an entire passage from the Greek poet
Aratus, which he illustrated by the criticisms of various annotators. Lalande
naturally felt curious to know in what manner his own treatise of astronomy
had been annotated by so accomplished a student, nor could he long remain
in doubt as to the value of this new acquisition to the interests of science. From

that time he regarded Delambre as a fellow-laborer; dissuaded him from a use- »

less attendance on the public lessons, and associating him with his own private
labors, confided to him the most difficult astronomical calculations. He induced
Mon. Dassy, whose son had previously received lessons from Delambre, to
establish a private observatory at his hotel. Here, being provided with the
necessary instruments, Delambre entered on a course of the most extensive
observation and research ; digested a plan for reforming all the astronomical
tables, and may be said to have conseerated his life to the study and description
of the heavens. ‘This destination had presented itself to his mind at Compiégne,
and was originally suggested by a physician of that place—a man of learning,
who was the confidant of Delambre’s studies, and had remarked his extraordi-
nary turn for earnest and continuous occupation. Lalande, who knew no dis-
tinction between his own interests and those of the science he cultivated, sought
the acquaintance of the individual who had given this judicious advice, and
thanked him in terms to which no personal obligation could have imparted
greater warmth.*

It remains now to indicate the important researches to which Delambre ap-
plied himself, and which constituted his title to a placein the Academy of Sciences.
Herschel, about this time, had observed on the extreme confines of the planetary
world an orb till then unknown—a brilliant discovery, which afforded a new
proof of the truth of the modern theories of physics. ‘This planet was found to

tomed boasting!y to style the latter his best work. —TRANSLATOR.

be subjected to the mathematical laws of gravitation ; its course and the places
which it had occupied in the heavens were susceptible of demonstration. It
was thus ascertained that it had been before observed by different astronomers,
who had not, however, distinguished it from the fixed stars. Delambre under-
took the preparation of tables respecting its movements, and published them
without delay, presenting with great exactness all the observations which had
been made up to that time. The Academy of Sciences had proposed this sub-
ject for one of its annual prizes, and bestowed its suffrage on the work of De-
lambre. <A striking attestation was herein afforded to the precision of the new
astronomical methods; for though Herschel’s planet had described but a tenth
part of its course since its discovery, its movements were determined with as
much exactness as those of other planets, our knowledge of which ascends to
periods of remote antiquity.

To Delambre we owe also those tables of the sun which were published at
the same time ; as likewise those of Jupiter and Saturn. He undertook further
to construct ecliptic tables of the satellites of Jupiter, and completed this arduous
and immense labor in a few years.

The object of astronomical tables is to represent the actual state of the heavens
at a given moment. They proceed upon the general principle of the stability
of natural laws, and from the past enable us to attain a knowledge of the future.
These researches are guided by geometry, which was said by Plato to have its
abode in the heavens. They are controlled also by other mathematical theories
which the moderns have invented, and which have served to detect the causes
and the laws of celestial movements.

The most general phenomena, it was first perceived, were necessary conse-
quences of the mathematical laws of gravitation ; still later, more precise observa-
tions indicated irregularities in the course of certain heavenly bodies, which did
not appear to result from the general laws. It was asked if the resistance of
an etherial medium might not affect the planetary movements; if gravitation
was as simple in its action as had been supposed ; if the transmission of its force
was instantaneous or progressive, like that of light. These doubts no longer
exist, and it was in the bosom of this Academy that they were resolved. The
inequalities which seemed inexplicable are necessary results of a mutual action
between the celestial bodies ; they are no exceptions to the mathematical laws
of gravity, which, on the contrary, they serve to confirm. The planctary world
ozcillates between limits which it cannot transcend; it contains within itself
principles of stability and duration which suftice to govern and preserve it. It
was the imperfection of knowledge alone which led astronomers to have recourse
to occasional compensatory causes. ‘The more the universe has been studied,
the more admirable have appeared the unity and simplicity of its laws. Never
have the sciences attained perfection without evincing the immutable order which
an infinite wisdom has impressed on all its works.

All these momentuous questicns respecting the system of the world were under
discussion when Delambre gave himself with characteristic ardor to the study
of astronomy. He assisted at the sitting of the Academy when Laplace com-
municated his important discoveries on the respective inequalities of Jupiter and
Saturn, and at once conceived the design of applying the results of that profound
analysis to perfect the tables of those two planets.

To collect and discuss all the observations which have been taken, so as to
render them comparable with one another and with the results of scientific
theory; to distinguish, by this means, the elements proper to be employed, and
to assign to those elements the value due to them in reconciling the theorems of
analysis with the observed facts; such is, in general, the succession of steps to
be followed in the construction of astronomical tables.

Delambre applied himself especially to those of the sateilites of Jupiter—an
undertaking so arduous, and of such vast extent, that nothing i-ss than the two
128 MEMOIR OF DELAMBRE.

powerful motives of public utility and the grandeur of the subject could have
sustained him in its prosecution. The satellites which accompany Jupiter, and
which disappear when they enter into his shadow, were the first celestial bodies
revealed to us by the telescope. ‘Their eclipses, so entirely analogous to those
of the moon, recur much more frequently than the latter; for a single one of
these bodies is obscured four times in the space of seven days. Galileo, who
first contemplated these singular phenomena, quickly inferred that observations
of this kind might be rendered eminently subservient to the promotion of geo-
graphical science. In fact, it required but a knowledge of the courses of these
satellites, and their reduction into tables of sufficient exactness, to rectify a
multitude of enormous errors in the determination of longitude, especially in
regard to the eastern portions of the Old Continent. It is true, indeed, that
many causes concur to limit the use and precision of this method, but it cannot
the less be looked upon as an invaluable source of discovery, and in its conse-
quences as one of the most fortunate of modern inventions; for even at this day
the navigator derives the easiest means of ascertaining the proximity of Jand
and the relative position of the places he is approaching from a group of celes-
tial objects, whose minute size seemed to withdraw them forever from human
observation. Nor is this the only consideration by which this world of Jupiter
is recommended to our admiration, and invested with an interest not inferior to
that of any other portion of the heavens. To an attentive observation of the
eclipses of his satellites we owe our knowledge of the fact that the action of light
is not instantaneous; and from the same source has been derived the precise
measure of the time which is required for its propagation from the sun to our
globe—a capital discovery, made by Reaumer at the observatory of Paris, and
which a subsequent theory has fully confirmed.

» The system composed of Jupiter and his four satellites is a world apart, whose
rapid revolutions mirror to us those which are taking place in the general system
of the sun aud planets. Hence, the study of the inequalities of those satellites
may be said to economize astronomic time, as they present to our view a class
of phenomena which will require an immense series of ages for their development
in the planetary system.

The three first satellites of Jupiter are subjected, by their mutual action and
that of the planet, to two very remarkable laws, not less simple or constant than
those of Kepler. There is a reciprocal dependence between their movements
and their positions, so that the place of two of them being known, that of the
third is thereby determined; and as one consequence of this state of things, they
can never be all three eclipsed at the same time. Laplace had discovered these
laws, and had demonstrated that they are necessary results from the mutual
action of the satellites, and that the same cause tends to perpetuate their opera-
tion. All observation affording subsistent proof of the truth of these laws,
Delambre made those admirable theorems of Laplace the basis of his researches.
He had occupied several years in the composition of ecliptic tables founded upon
them, when the Academy of Sciences proposed the same inquiries as the subject
of a prize. This was awarded to Delambre. As he had before obtained this
distinction on account of the planet Herschel, he now a second time earned it
on account of those of Galileo. A short time before this he had been elected a
member of the Academy.

About this time the execution of a grand and difficult project was set on foot
in France—a project whose importance had attracted the interest of all en-
lightened nations, its object being to establish a uniform system of measures
founded on some natural and invariable base. As the chief element of the
French metrical system, a determinate portion of the terrestrial meridian was
fixed upon, and a fortunate opportunity was thus offered of renewing those im-
portant geodesic operations which have carried to probably the highest attain-
able degree of precision our knowledge of the figure and dimensions of the

a

globe. To Delambre and Mechain was confided the task of measuring an are
of the meridian from Dunkirk as far as Barcelona—a vast undertaking, whose
character, progress, and difficulties it is impossible here to detail. Suffice it to
say, that its success was principally due to Delambre; he has written its his-
tory, and it is to his works we must resort if we would acquire a just and
accurate knowledge of the care which it exacted and the results which it
produced.

To trace this meridional line of more than two hundred leagues in length,
and actually to measure it in its whole extent, is what could never have been
proposed : it is the office of geometry to supply the place of immediate measure-
ment. But what a multitude of obstacles does the execution present! The
temperature of the air and of solid bodies is continually changing; the atmos-
phere, whose state is so variable, deflects light from a direct course ; the unequal
height of the points to be observed, the difficulty of selecting, placing, and
maintaining signals, all conspire against the exactness of results, which may
be varied also by the attraction of mountains and influenced by inequalities in
the figure or mass of the globe. Physics, astronomy, and mathematical analysis
must combine their lights to dissipate these causes of uncertainty and error,
and to enable the operator to distinguish among the various species of proof
that which is applicable to his immediate object.

We must restrict ourselves here to citing one remarkable instance of verifi-
cation which occurred in comparing the two bases of Perpignan and Melun,
each in extent about three leagues. Delambre had taken the length of both by
actual measurement. Now, one only of these measurements was necessary, for
the two bases being comprised in a common chain of consecutive triangles, the
one could be deduced from the other by calculation. Having submitted the
operations to this singular proof, the more decisive from the fact that the twe
bases are about two hundred and ‘twenty leagues distant from one another, it
was found that there was not the difference of the third of a metre between the
result of the calculation and that of the measurement. Thus was determined,
by a trigonometrical operation, a line of about three leagues in length from a
distance of more than two hundred leagues, and the error was less than a foot,
that is to say, the thirty-sixth thousandth part of the line calculated. I will
not say that Delambre was surprised at this coincidence; but he was at least
highly gratified, for it was the result alike of his own assiduity and of the
astonishing accuracy of the instruments. Those used for the measurement of
angles, as well as for taking astronomical observations, were the repeating circles
of Borda, whose advantage especially consists in the distribution of any one
error over a multitude of observations. ‘The process adopted for measuring the
bases, which is likewise due to the same great physicist, consists in the right
application of a measure formed of platina, which serves at the same time as a
measure and a thermometer.

Thus far we have spoken only of difficulties incident to geodesic operations
in general, but‘the conductors of the grand work we are considering were often
impeded by obstacles of a different nature. Their progress was beset not only
with keen anxieties, but injurious suspicions and personal annoyance. Mechain,
who has left us a great number of highly valuable observations, was subjected
to quite a long imprisonment, and suffered much from the effects of unremitting
fatigue. ‘The principal operation, however, was finished, and, as he had always
designed, Mechain wished to carry the measurement as far as the Balearic
islands, but died in a foreign land before the results of his painful labors were
laid before the public. Delambre, to whose share shad fallen a much more ex-
tensive portion of the work, collected all the elements of it, and published them
in a leading work which must be regarded as one of the noblest monuments
of science. He had quitted Paris in the last days of the month of June,
1792. It is easy to judge how little favorable the political condition of France

at the time, and the violent passions which inflamed all the parties of the realm,
must have been to a scientific enterprise whose advantages could only be appre-
ciated by enlightened minds.

Suspicions accordingly were soon excited by the arrangements which it was
necessary to make, especially during the night, and by the employment of in-
comprehensible signals and instruments. The villagers flocked together; they
questioned the astronomers, and demanded the instructions under which they
acted, and which seemed to those ignorant minds the cover to some guilty mys-
tery. Delambre, who always believed that good faith, patience, and the desire
of being useful, would triumph over all obstacles, showed the instruments, ex-
plained their use, and, to employ his own expressions, undertook to give lessons
in geodesic astronomy on the public squares of Lagny, Epinay, and St. Denis.
By this means he succeeded in convincing some of his auditors. But the re-
newal of these annoying and perilous interruptions made a suspension of the
work unavoidable. And although this first obstruction was not of any long
duration, and Delambre was allowed after a while to prosecute his original
operations, yet he was called shortly after to endure a persecution still more
odious and protracted. Under the most frivolous pretexts he was excluded
from the commission for determining the new system of measures. ‘The record
of this decision may still be consulted, and we there see that it was the modera-
tion of his opinions, which was imputed to him as a crime, and which led to his
being forbidden even to take part in the measurement of the meridian, The
same order excludes Borda, Delambre, Coulomb, Laplace, and Lavoisier; it
bears the signatures of Robespierre, Billaud-Varenne, Couthon, and Collot-d’-
Herbois. How significant this apposition of names, the most illustrious and
the most odious. But I shall not detain your attention on those unhappy
times which are already far removed from us; the history of science delights
only in the recollections of a state of public harmony and concord.

Delambre might well entertain disquieting apprehensions, and he accordingly
did all in his power to cause himself to be forgotten. Restored to his seden-
tary occupations, he divided his time between science and letters. The Muses
a second time embellished his retreat; they had animated his youth ; they con-
soled his manhood. The Muses are beneficent and hospitable; they offer an
asylum to every misfortune; they welcome outraged merit and lift it above the
injustice of cotemporaries ; they smile upon those who have no patrimony but’
their time and fill their solitude with charms; to all conditions of life they
whisper consoling hopes and inspire noble sentiments.

After an interruption of two years, Delambre, who had carefully preserved
all the results of his labors, found it practicable to renew his exclusive attention
to them. He resumed them at first under a different title, but after no long
time arrangements for continuing the measurement of the meridian were fully
restored. With his usual constancy, Delambre prosecuted all the details of the
vast undertaking, which was completed before the last year of the century.
The results obtained were calculated according to different methods, several of
which were proposed by Delambre. A remarkable theorem of Legendre’s was
also employed in these calculations and evinced its peculiar adaptation to the
uses of geodesic mensuration,

When the importance of the subject is considered, the questions of astronomy,
geometry, and physics, which it was necessary to resolve, the celebrated names
of French or foreign savants, who lent their co-operation to the inquiry, and
the weighty and durable consequences of its result, it is not too much to say
that no other application of science is to be compared with this as regards its
character of exactness, utility and magnitude. Such was the judgment passed
upon it by all the academies of Europe, and the opinion of the ‘Institute of
France was formally expressed when called upon to designate the most import-
ant application of mathematical or physical science which had occurred within
MEMOIR OF DELAMBRE. 131

ten years. With entire unanimity of suffrages the prize was assigned to the
author of the base of the metrical system.

The length of a determinate part of the meridian was at last known with ex-
traordinary precision, and upon this result, together with that of the memorable
experiments of Lefevre-Gineau, has been founded the established system of
French measures.

‘This great work comprehends all the experiments which have been made in
different places on the length of the pendulum. conformably to the processes
invented by Borda; as well as all the observations made with the design of
prolonging the are of the meridian to Fromentera, and also towards the north,
where it unites the geodesic labors of France with those of Great Britain.

One of the most remarkable results of modern science is that which relates
to the elliptical form of the terrestrial globe. The flattening of the regions
around the poles, as determined by the revolution of the globe upon its axis, is
demonstrated by all our geodesic measurements, as it is also by a comparison
of the lengths of the pendulum; and, what must be regarded as one of the most
astonishing attestations to the perfection of our astronomic theories, the measure
of this ellipticity is deducible with great exactness from an attentive observa-
tion of the movements of the moon. In the course of that planet, irregularities.
have been discovered which are owing to the action of the earth, and which
could not exist if the earth were an exact sphere. Even the amount of the
flattening has been deduced from these irregularities with more precision than:
was attainable by immediate measurements carried on successively in different.
regions of the globe,

In this we see a striking proof of the progress of science, for not a century
has elapsed since the elliptical figure of the earth was still a problem. Not
only was the depression of the polar region disputed within the walls of acade-
mies, but a theory directly the contrary of this had been proposed and obsti-
nately maintained. In our day all doubts are resoived. Geodesic operations
in France, England, Equatorial America, and the British possessions in India;
a comparison of the length of the seconds pendulum as observed in different
climates; and, as already remarked, the theory of the lunar inequalities—all
concur in giving the same value as the measure of terrestrial ellipticity. But
this question of the figure of the earth, so prolific of important results, can never
be discussed without reference to that great system of operations for which we
are mainly indebted to Delambre. Already an associate of most foreign acade-
mies, and member of the bureau of longitudes in France, he was elected by the
Institute perpetual secretary for the class of mathematical sciences.

We must now advert to the happy union which he contracted with a party
every way worthy of him, the mother of a youth named De Pommard, who had:
accompanied him in all his geodesic expeditions. Under the tuition of this
mother, the young man had acquired, in addition to correct principles of literary
taste, a familiar acquaintance with the finest productions of foreign literature..
Delambre attached himself more and more to this companion of his labors,.
developed his talents, and enlightened him by his counsels and example. The
mother appreciated justly the value of such a friendship, and it is not difficult
to imagine how much her heart was touched by the advantages which resulted
from it. Having become a widow, Madame de Pommard espoused the friend.
and protector of her son—the man whose talents and character were honored
by the whole of scientifie Europe. She honored them herself, for no one could.
better appreciate high endowments of the heart and intellect. The motives
which brought about this union rendered it fortunate ; but the family thus ten-
derly united was not destined to a durable happiness. It was smitten by the
unexpected and deplorable loss of the son, who had been the object of so many
vows, anxieties, and hopes. His mother found at least as much consolation as:
the calamity admitted of in the tender affection of Delambre. Thus eighteen
132 MEMOIR OF DELAMBRE.

\
years passed away in the bosom of friendship, confidence, and peace; in con
genial occupations, and the exercise of mutual kindness. In the mean time
Delambre had succeeded Lalande in the chair of astronomy at the College of
France, and was appointed one of the principal te¢ularies of the ‘university.
For twenty years that he exercised in one of the classes of the Institute and
in the Royal Academy of Sciences the function bestowed on him by the suf-
frages of his colleagues, he cannot be said to have ever once swerved from the
line of strict impartiality and equity ; and though fidelity to such duties be but
the acquittal of an obligation, and no proper subject for formal eulogy, yet it
can never be useless to cite as an example that earnestness of purpose which
always animated him, or that considerate indulgence which was so much a part
of his nature that no personal motive or even injustice could affect it. In his
annual reports, in the historic eulogies which he gave to the public, and in his
delineations of the progress of science, we everywhere trace the consummate
erudition which distinguished him, and recognize a talent for writing formed
upon the noblest models. Above all, we would signalize that peculiar tempera-
ment which made it for him an agreeable and easy ofiice to exhibit the preduc-
tions of others in the most favorable light, while at the same time he did not
permit himself the slightest deviation from the truth of history.

His literary and scientific labors were 80 numerous and extensive that we can
scarcely be expected to recount them, or even distinctly to explain their objects.
Sufiice it to say that, besides all the works or memoirs which he published separ-
ately, or inserted in the academic collections of Paris, Berlin, and ‘Turin, and in
that known as “La Connaissance des Temps,” [we have from his hand a com-
plete historical series, comprising “ The History of Ancient Astronomy,” in 2
vols. 4to., 1817; “The History of the Astronomy of the Middle Ages,” 1 vol.
4to., 1819; “The History of Modern Astronomy,” 2 vols. 4to., 1821; ‘ The
History of Astronomy in the Eighteenth Century,” and “ The History of the
Measurement of the Earth,” the two latter having been published since his death;
of which works it has been justly said “that no other country has produced
anything of the same kind of equal extent and value.”] The enumeration of
such labors would constitute the most unequivocal title to literary merit, as being
calculated to display it in all its brilliancy without effort or exaggeration. If
this test were applied to the works of Delambre we could not be deceived as to
the rank they must occupy in the history of the sciences. Before him astro-
nomical calculations were founded on numerical processes, which were at once
indirect and irregular. These he has changed throughout, or ingeniously re-
modelled. Most of those which astronomers use at the present time belong to
him, having been deduced from analytic formulas, which, in their application,
have been found alike sure, uniform, and manageable. The new tables which
he has given us of the sun, of Jupiter, of Saturn, of Uranus, and of the satellites
of Jupiter, at least some of them, may have been considerably improved by re-
cent labors founded on a greater number of exact observations ; yet, in the pre-
sent state of astronomy, and up to this day, the tables of Delambre just mentioned
are those employed in the calculations made for the “‘Connaissance des Temps”
and for the nautical and astronomical ephemerides of most nations. In addition,
the geodetic operation, for which we are chiefly indebted to him, and of which
he bore the greatest share, is the most perfect and extensive which has been
executed in any country. It has served as the model of all enterprises of the
kind which have been since projected.

That the labors of Delambre should have had this influence on the method
of astronomy is the more remarkable, considering the somewhat advanced age
at which he came to the cultivation of the science. He was more than thirty-
five when he began to practice observations. The history of the sciences, how-
ever, is not without such examples. Newton, it is true, was in possession of all
his great mathematical discoveries at an age which Leibnitz had not yet attained
MEMOIR OF DELAMBRE. 135

when he first devoted himself to such studies, yet Leibnitz, but a few years
later, was one of the inventors of the infinitesimal analysis. But it is to be re-
membered that both Leibnitz and Delambre had been diligent students from
their earliest youth ; they had acquired, so to say, the literary habit ; their minds
had been disciplined to long research. In the works of Delambre we possess
an almost complete astronomical library; in his ‘Treatise on Astronomy every
known method is reviewed and compared; while his histories of the science
furnish a complete deduction of its progress through every stage, from the most
remote epochs to the year 1822. The latter portions of this work, unpublished
during his life, have received the superintending care of M. Mathieu, an asso-
ciate of the institute and a former pupil and friend of the deceased.

We will not here recall the questions which have been raised respecting the
origin of astronomical knowledge among the ancients. Such a discussion would
involve an attentive study of all extant monuments, and the solution of many
difficult questions in spherical geometry ; it implies, also, a critical examination
of the most ancient sources of historical information. ‘Those sources are all in-
dicated in Delambre’s work, and his learned analysis can never be dispensed
with, whatever be the opinion we may form on the general subject. What, more
than all, distinguishes his history of ancient astronomy from the works which
preceded it having the same object, is the care which the author has taken to
give a clear explanation of the methods pursued by each successive astronomer.
These he has rendered by means of the signs employed in modern analysis; and
it is remarkable that in rendering he has in almost every instance suggested
some improvement in the method.

The long and persevering labors which engrossed him to the last, and from
which nothing could divert him—which knew, indeed, no interruption but the
few hours of sleep he allowed himself, began to tell more and more upon his
health during the last years of his life. The malady through which his services
were at last lost to science declared itself in July, 1822; and from the first a
fatal issue was foreshadowed by long and frequent faintings and a total loss of
strength. He seemed, himself, to foresee the event, preserving to the last in-
stant his unalterable evenness of temper and serenity of mind; so that when the
scene finally closed on the 19th of August, 1822, it might be truly said that,
though he had suffered much, he had given utterance to no complaint.

Were this the place to recall those scenes of regret and sorrow which followed,
what could be added to the noble and touching words pronounced at his obse-
quies? What tribute of honor to his memory could hope to vie with that in
which his illustrious colleague, the witness of his labors and his virtues, embod-
ied the regrets and valedictigns of this Academy ?*

A sketch has been thus given of the most remarkable incidents in the life of
Delambre. If happiness consist in ennobling occupations for the mind; in the
exercise of benevolent affections, and the mastery and possession of one’s self,
what destiny could be happier than his? He enjoyed no exemption from the
passing annoyances of lite, but its most lasting and desirable blessings were
secured to him as the result of assiduous study, disinterested friendship, and
inflexible integrity. The consistency of his character was maintained in every
situation, as well by the moderation of his desires when deprived of the advan-
tages of fortune, as by the use which he made of those advantages when he
possessed them. From earliest youth he had imbibed at its very source a fa-
miliarity with all that antiquity has left us of the true and the sublime; and his
maturer life was passed in a contemplation of the phenomena of the universe,
and in an intimate association with the most celebrated of his cotemporaries.
No feelings of hate, no bitter regrets, no ambitious desires troubled his spirit ;

offence he offered to none, and envy itself respected his repose. How few are
the distinguished men to whom such a lot was granted; and how easily could
this reflection be made more striking by a recital of some of the exalted names
which preceded him. How melancholy the contrast which is presented in the
exile of Tycho, the indigence of Kepler, the illustrious misfortunes of Galileo.
Delambre has left works whose extent and nature place him in the first rank of
the promoters of science. Both poetry and friendship have been exerted in his
praise; and if anything is wanting to his memory, it is a successor who might
more worthily have executed the present attempt to do justice to his character
and genius. But history, with its eloquent and faithful voice, will redress even
this disadvantage in perpetuating to after ages the recollection of so many useful

and noble labors.
ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

BY M. DELAUNAY, OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.

TRANSLATED FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BY ALFRED M. MAYER, PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS, PENN-
SYLVANIA COLLEGE, GETTYSBURG.

Tue precise determination of the velocity with which light traverses space,
first accomplished by the aid of astronomical observations, and then reduced
to the proportions of a simple experiment of physics, made in a laboratory of
small dimensions, constitutes certainly one of the wonders of modern science.
We propose to exhibit in this essay the different phases through which the
problem has passed, and the various methods which have been successively
employed to arrive at its solution.

We will first endeavor to convey a clear idea of what is understood by the
velocity of light.

In order to account for the various phenomena of optics, physicists have
imagined two systems* in reference to the ultimate nature of light. According
to one, every luminous body throws out contjnually and in all directions into
space corpuscles of an extreme tenuity, which in penetrating our eye there
produce the sensation called light; this is the system of emission. According
to the other, light is the vibratory motion of an excessively rare fluid existing
in all space, and known under the name of ether ; a luminous body only pro-
duces and keeps up around itself this vibratory movement which is progres-
sively propagated to an indefinite distance ; this constitutes the system of undu-
lation. Can we certainly say that either system is a true expression of what
exists? We cannot. Fora long time one system as well as the other ac-
counted for all known optical phenomena; now we know that certain phe-_
nomena that we have succeeded in producing cannot be explained by the sys-
tem of emission, whilst the system of undulation logically embraces them;
the latter, therefore, of the two can alone be the true expression of the facts.
But it may happen that at some future day we will discover new phenomena
which will be no more explicable by the system of undulation than those men-
tioned can be by the system of emission. But however that may be, it is
necessary, in order to give clearness and precision to our reasoning, to represent
the phenomena as taking place according to one or the other system, provided
we do not absolutely give our mental consent to such a system as being a true
expression of existing facts.

In the system of emission the luminous corpuscles thrown out in all diree-
tions are in reality projectiles which move uniformly and in straight lines,
provided they are not submitted to causes of change of motion, such as those
which result from the meeting of ponderable or gross matter. ‘The velocity
with which these projectiles move in space is what we call the velocity of light.

* The word system is used by the author in this essay to designate a body of doctrine, and,
therefore, may mean either theory or hypothesis. See Prof. J. Henry’s Syllabus of Lectures
on Physics for the true meaning of these words, which, unfortunately, are so generally mis-
understood and thoughtlessly used. An hypothesis may be defined as an assumed law,
whereas a theory is ‘‘ the exact expression of the law of a class of facts,” and may be termed
a vindicated hypothesis.— Translator.
136 ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

According to the system of undulation light is produced by a succession of
vibratory motions of the ether which emanate from the luminous body and are
propagated indefinitely around it into space. We can arrive at a clear idea of
such propagation by observing the circular waves which dilate from a centre
of agitation on a smooth liquid surface, such, for example, as are produced when
we cast a stone into a calm lake. ‘The luminous waves are spherical, and have
for common centre the source of the light; they expand as they move forward,
like the circular waves formed on the surface of the water. If we imagine a
straight line drawn from the centre of vibration and extended indefinitely into
space, each luminous wave will reach the different points of that line along
which it uniformly progresses ; the velocity of the light is the length the wave
runs over on that line in the unit of time. But we can also have a clear idea
of the velocity of light without adopting any hypothesis in reference to the
manner in which it is produced. If a source of light, a candle for example, is
lighted or extinguished suddenly, this instantaneous phenomenon will not be
perceived at the same instant at all points of the space from which we can
observe it. If we are quite near to the light we will perceive it immediately ;
if we are far off there will be a certain amount of time between the production
of the phenomenon and its perception by the eye, and this time will be so much
the longer as the distance between the source of light and the eye is greater.
The phenomenon of which we have just spoken takes, therefore, a certain time
to run over the distance which separates the place of its production from the
eye of the observer, and it is natural to admit that it takes equal times to run
over equal portions of that distance; that is to say, that it progresses in any direc-
tion whatever, like a moving body animated with a uniform velocity. ‘The
velocity of light is the velocity with which a phenomenon of light is thus
propagated to a distance; or, in other terms, it is the distance at which the
eye ought to be placed trom the point where the phenomenon is produced, in
order that a unit of time may elapse between the instant of its production and
the instant of its perception by the eye.

After what has been said, nothing can be easier than to invent the means to
determine the velocity of light. It will suflice to proceed as we always do
when we desire to measure the velocity of a mass moving uniformly. If we
wish to determine, for example, the velocity of a train on a railroad, we place
ourselves in one of the ears, and, furnished with a second-watch, we observe
how many seconds elapse between the instant of passing one mile-post and the
instant of passing the next post following; if we thus find 2 minutes or 120
seconds, we divide the distance of 1 mile or 5,280 feet by 120, and the quotient
44 shows that the train runs over 44 feet in 1 second. In general, we observe
the time employed by the body to move over a known distance, and then we
divide the distance by the time expressed in seconds, and the quotient is the
velocity in one second of time.

In order to apply this method to the measure of the velocity of light, let us
imagine two sources of light, A and B, two lamps with reflectors, for example,
placed several thousand yards apart. If we suddenly place just before the
lamp A a screen, the observer at B will not at that instant see the light at A
disappear; he will see it disappear only after the time employed by the light
to run over the distance between the two lamps. If at the very instant that
the observer at B sees the light A disappear he screens, in his turn, the light B,
the observer at A will not see the light B disappear until a short time after it
-has been screened, on account of the time the light occupies to run over the
distance between the two lamps. The interval of time comprised between the
instant the lamp A was screened and the instant when the observer stationed ~
at that lamp perceived the disappearance of the lamp B, is, therefore, the time
employed by the light to run over twice the distance A B; if we measure this

, ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 137
time by any means whatsoever, we have only to divide double the distance A B
by the time found in order to obtain the velocity of the light.

In proceeding as we have just indicated, no matter how great may be the
distance of the two lamps A and B placed on the surface of the earth so that
either may be seen from the place where the other is stationed, we always find
that the time elapsed between the instant the screen is placed before the light
A and the instant when the light B disappears to the observer stationed at A is
absolutely inappreciable. It appears as if the extinction of the light of each
of the two lamps was perceived at the same instant, without any delay, at
the station of the other lamp; that is to say, as if the velocity of light was
infinitely great. This happens because the velocity of light, although not
infinitely great, yet is of a very high value; light going over in one second
about three hundred thousand kilometres, (about 190,000 miles,*) or 74 times
the circumference of the earth; it therefore does not employ, in the experi-
ments we have just explained, to go from one lamp to the other but a fraction
of a second, absolutely inappreciable by the ordinary means of observation.

Every one has observed that sound requires a certain length of time to come
from a distance. If we observe afar off a wood-cutter strike with his axe the
trunk of a tree, we see each blow some time hefore we hear the sound which
it occasions. On account of the extremely high velocity of light we can say
that we perceive the blow at the very instant it is given by the wood-cutter;
the interval of time which elapses between the instant when we see the blow
and the instant when we hear it, is therefore the time employed by the sound
to come from the tree to the place we occupy. This time, which is very appre-
ciable, is so much the longer as we are at a greater distance from the wood-
cutter. If we remove ourselves to such a distance that the interval is exactly
one second, then we will have but to measure the distance to the tree in order
to have the velocity of the sound. Instead of that, we can proceed as we indi-
cated for light, by replacing the lamps A and B by cannon whose discharge
we can instantly bring about. It is in operating thus that we have found that
sound runs over 333 metres in one second of time.t There is the greatest
analogy between the progressive transmission of light to adistance and the
progressive transmission of sound through the atmosphere; only light is propa-
gated with a velocity incomparably greater than sound. The clear conception
of the progressive transmission of sound to a distance which we have arrived
at from the preceding considerations renders it very easy to conceive the pro-
gressive transmission of light; and in order to understand clearly all we are
going to say of this last phenomenon we cannot do better than refer to the
analogous phenomenon of sound, which is directly accessible to our senses.

*Tn reducing the French measures of length to English, we have adopted Captain Kater’s
value of the'metre, the French unit of length, as equal to 39.37079 English inches, or 3.280899
English feet, or 0.6214 of an English mile. The brass scale made by Troughton for the
United States Coast Survey has been declared the standard of the United States, and the
value of the metre expressed in United States standard inches is given in the Coast Survey
Report, far 1853, as equal to 39. 36850535 United States standard inches, or 3.28070878
United States feet. Prof. Bache, in 1856, found that the Britisk bronze standard yard, No.
11, is shorter than the American yard by 0.00087 inch.— Translator.

+ It may be stated, in round numbers, that sound, in dry air and at the freezing tempera-
ture, travels at the rate of 1,090 feet, or 363 yards, per second, and every additional degree
of atmospheric temperature. on Fahrenheit’s scale, adds 1.14 foot to that velocity, so that at
62° Fahrenheit (which is the standard temperature of the British metrical system) it runs |
over 9,000 feet in’8 seconds, 122 British miles in a minute, or 765 miles in an hour, which
is about three-fourths of the diurnal velocity of the earth’s equator. Hence, in latitude 424,
if a gun be fired at the momenta star passes the meridian of any station, the sound will
teach any other station exactly west of it at the precise instant of the same star’s arriving on
tts meridian.—Sir J, Herschel.
138 ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGH?.

DISCOVERY OF THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT, BY ROBMER.

During a long period we had no knowledge of the velocity of light. On ac-
count of the extreme greatness of that velocity, the phenomena of light pro-
duced on the earth being perceived immediately at considerable distances on
the surface of the globe, it was usual to consider the passage of light through
space as absolutely instantaneous.* The honor of the discovery of the pro-_
gressive transmission of light and the determination of the value of its velocity
is due to Roémer, a Danish astronomer who was induced by Picard to settle in
France in 1672. He made the important discovery by examining and discuss-
ing with care the observations on the eclipse of the first satellite of Jupiter.

It is well known that Jupiter, the greatest of the planets which, like the earth,
circulates around the sun, is accompanied by four moons or satellites. These
satellites move around the planet in the same manner as the planets move
around the sun, conformably to the laws of Kepler; their elliptical orbits are
in planes slightly inclined to the plane of the orbit of Jupiter. The planets
and their satellites have not a light of their own, and we can only see them
when they are illuminated by the sun. If any obstacle prevents the light from
falling on one of these bodies, it becomes invisible, or, in other words, it is
eclipsed. This is what happens frequently to each of the satellites of Jupiter.
The satellite in circulating around its planet comes to a portion of its orbit which,
relatively to the sun, is behind Jupiter; the planet intercepting the rays of the
sun, the satellite is eclipsed for a certain time: this is a phenomenon entirely
simidar to the eclipses of the moon which we from time to time have the oppor-
tunity of observing. If we imagine a cone enveloping at the same time the
sun and Jupiter, so that the surface of the cone is tangential to the two spheres,
the light of the sun cannot reach any point of the space situate within the cone
and beyond Jupiter; this space is what we call the wmbra or umbral cone of
the planet. A satellite is eclipsed every time that in circulating around the
planet it penetrates this umbral cone; and the eclipse ceases the instant it has
traversed it. On account of the large transverse dimensions of the umbral
cone of Jupiter due to the size of the planet, and also on account of the slight
inclination of the orbits of its satellites to the orbit the planet describes around
the sun, these satellites penctrate at each of their revolutions the umbral cone;
there is an exception alone for the fourth satellite, (that which is the furthest
from the planet,) which passes sometimes above or below the umbral cone with-
out penetrating it, when it passes in the parts of its orbit the most distant from
the plane of the orbit of Jupiter.

The eclipses of the first satellite of Jupiter (that which is nearest to the
planet) are much more frequent than those of the other satellites, on account
of the rapidity with which it describes its orbit. These eclipses are repeated
at intervals of about forty-two hours and a half. Also the eccentricity of the
orbit of this satellite being insensible, its movement around the planet is circular
and uniform: there necessarily results a great regularity in the occurrence of
the successive eclipses. ‘Ihese phenomena are easily observed from the earth,

* The experiment of the lights explained above was made by Galileo, and did not give any
result. Subsequently, Descartes thought of a celestial phenomenon which he imagined would
be affected by the progressive transmission of light. He saw that if light occupies a certain
time to traverse the distance which separates us from the moon, then that satellite, at the
moment it is eclipsed by the interposition of the earth between the sun and the moon, should
not appear to occupy in the heavens a position diametrically opposite to the sun; it should,
on the contrary, appear notably distant from that position. Observation did not show any-
thing similar, and he concluded that light was transmitted instantaneously through space.
These negative results only prove that the velocity of light is too great to produce, in these
circumstances, effects appreciable by the means of observation employed. They can, at the
most, as Huyghens remarks, furnish an inferior limit to the velocity of light, and do not at
all prove that this velocity is infinite.

ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 139

even with telescopes of rather low power, which suffice to render the satellites
of Jupiter very distinct when they are not eclipsed. We ought, however, to
remark that it is never possible to observe the beginning and the end of the
same eclipse of the first satellite, because, as we only see the umbral cone ob-
liquely, a good portion of this cone, at the distance of the first satellite, is hidden
from us by the planet itself. If we observe the satellite when it enters the
umbral cone, it passes soon behind the planet, which prevents us from seeing it
go out of the cone. If at other times we observe it when it comes out of the
umbral cone, a short time before, and especially at the moment it enters the
cone, it is hidden from us by the planet. When Jupiter is to the west of the
sun, the umbral cone, which is always on the side away from the sun, is situate
to the west of the planet; we therefore see the first satellite enter the umbral
cone, but we do not see it go out, or, to use the language of astronomers, we
see the zmmersion of the satellite, but we do not see the emersion. When
Jupiter is to the east of the sun, it is the contrary that happens: the umbral
cone is projected to the east of the planet, and we can observe the emersion
whilst the immersion is invisible.

Whilst in Padua, in 1610, Galileo discovered the satellites of Jupiter. The
rapidity of the displacement of these little spheres to one side and to the other
of the planet, the frequency of their extinction and of their reillumination,
naturally excited the curiosity of astronomers, who accumulated observations
on them. It was in studying these observations on the immersions and the
emersions of the first satellite, in order to arrive at the means of predicting
their eclipses, that Roémer made the capital discovery which we now propose
to discuss.

In order to fully comprehend the influence of the progressive transmission of
light through space on the observations of the eclipses of the first satellite of
Jupiter, and clearly to understand the manner in which Roémer was enabled
to deduce the value of the velocity of light from the numerous observations of
this phenomenon which had up to that period been tabulated, let us take an
example relative to the progressive transmission of sound in our atmosphere.
Suppose that the same sound is repeated regularly at equal intervals during
any given time; this sound is produced, for example, by a wood-cutter who
strikes with his axe a tree, or by a blacksmith who strikes with a hammer a
piece of iron on his anvil. If we are quite near to the spot where the sound
is produced we hear and see atthe same instant each blow. If we remove to
a distance we no longer hear the blows at the same time we see them, and
the interval of time which elapses between seeing and hearing the same blow
becomes greater as the distance is increased. If, when far otf, we come near,
then go off again, and then come near, and so on, the interval of time between
seeing and hearing the same blow increases as we increase the distance, dimin-
ishes as we diminish the distance, increases again with the distance, and so on:
it thence results that, notwithstanding the regularity with which the blows of
the axe or hammer are given, the successive sounds which we hear have not
equal intervals, since the sounds which follow the blows which produce them
are at intervals of time which alternately increase and diminish. When we
walk towards the wood-cutter or the blacksmith, the sounds which we succes-
sively hear are at shorter intervals of time than the blows of the axe or
hammer, and the sounds are at greater intervals than the blows when we walk
away from the wood-cutter. In walking with a regular step the circumference
of a circle in the neighborhood of the place where the wood-cutter or the black-
smith works, we will be sometimes further off and sometimes nearer to the place;
and while we observe the blows succeed each other with great regularity, we
hear the sounds occasioned by these blows succeed each other sometimes with
diminishing intervals, and at other times with increasing intervals. ‘The irregu-
larity in the succession of the sounds is rendered very sensible by the continuous
140 ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

variation in the time comprised between seeing and hearing each blow; but
even when we only hear the blows without seeing them, that irregularity is
always detected by the attentive consideration of the successive sounds; it
seems as if the sounds experienced a periodic perturbation—that they take place
now before, now after the instants at which we ought to hear them so that they
would follow each other regularly. An observer placed in the conditions
which we have supposed, and ignorant of the conditions of the progressive*
transmission of sound, and who would thus hear the sounds of the axe or ham-
mer succeed each other now with rapidity, now with slowness, as he walked
round his circular path, might well imagine, at first, that the blows themselves
had this irregularity; but in thinking of the manner in which the blows are
produced, he would have reason to think that such a periodie irregularity in
their production was not very probable; and especially as he would remark that
the retardation and acceleration of the successive blows coincided always with
his going away from or his approach to the place where they originated, he
would naturally be led to attribute the irregularity of the succession of sounds
to his own change of position, and would thus be led to the discovery of the
progressive transmission of sound.

It was in exactly similar conditions that Roémer found himself when he
examined and discussed with care the observations of the eclipses of the first
satellite of Jupiter. This satellite, in entering the umbral cone of Jupiter,
suddenly loses its light, and in coming out of the umbral cone it instantly
regains it. There is, therefore, in the successive immersions and emersions of
that satellite, a series of phenomena of light which are reproduced as regularly
as the blows of the hammer of which we have spoken above. ‘The astronomer
who observes these phenomena is carried by the earth each year over an orbit
which differs little from a circle having the sun as a centre. It is true that
Jupiter moves at the same time around the sun, so that the place where the
eclipse of its first satellite takes place is displaced continually round that cen-
tral body ; but the time of the revolution of the earth around the sun being
much shorter than that of Jupiter, the distance of the observer from that
planet and from its satellite experiences the same-alternative increase and dimi-
nution of distance as if Jupiter were stationary. ‘The period of the returns of
the observer to the same distance from Jupiter is alone modified; it is about
399 days instead of only one year. If, therefore, light is not imstantaneously
transmitted to all distances, if it requires an appreciable time to run over a
length such as the diameter of the orbit of the earth, we ought to find the
effects in the observations of the eclipses of which we have just spoken. If
from observations continued through several years we deduce the mean interval
of time which separates two consecutive eclipses, we ought to find that the
time is greater than the interval really observed between two consecutive
eclipses while the earth is approaching Jupiter than the interval observed
while the earth is going away from Jupiter. If, in using the value of this
mean interval of time which elapses between one eclipse and the following and
setting out from an eclipse observed when the earth is at its mean distance ;
from Jupiter, we wish to predict the return of future eclipses, it happens that |
the instants when the eclipses are really observed are sometimes in advance of
and sometimes in retard of the predicted epochs, aceording as the earth is
nearer to or further from Jupiter than at the moment of departure from the
point of mean distance. ‘The times furnished by the observations for the com-
mencement or the ending of the different eclipses will therefore appear sub-
mitted to a periodic perturbation agreeing with the period of variation of the
distance of the earth from Jupiter. ‘This is precisely what Roémer found in
discussing the numerous*observations which he had in his possession of the
eclipses of Jupiter’s first satellite; he thus found that light employs 22
minutes to run over the diameter of the orbit of the earth around the sun, and

ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 141

consequently 11 minutes to run over the distance which separates us from that
body. He published his discovery in a memoir presented to the Academy of
Sciences of Paris in 1675, to which he had been elected a member a short time
after his arrival in France. The following is the account given in the Histoire
de l’ Académie, t. i, p. 213, année 1676 :

“Tt was only from this vast mass of observations that we commenced to see a truth of
physics hitherto unknown to all philosophers, and so ignored that the contrary was almost a
fixed principle.

‘‘4 great number of very exact calculations having been made of the revolutions of the
first satellite of Jupiter, and consequently of all its eclipses caused by the umbra-of Jupiter,
he found that at certain times, it came out of the shadow a few minutes too late, and at other
times sooner than it should have done, and he could not account for that variation by known
principles. In comparing these times with each other, M. Roémer saw that the satellite
came too late from the shadow always when the earth, in its annual movement, was going
away from Jupiter, and too soon when it was approaching the planet. From these facts M.
Roémer began to form the ingenious conjecture that light requires an appreciabie time to
traverse space. That granted, if the satellite appeared to come out of the shadow too late
when we were furthest off from it, it did not follow that it really did emerge too late, but its
light took longer to come to us, for, so to speak, we had run away from it. On the contrary,
when we went to meet it, the time of the satellite in the shadow should appear shorter.

“*To test the truth of this idea, he calculated what differences in the emersions of the satel-
lite corresponded to different distances of the earth, and he found that the light was retarded
eleven minutes for a length equal to the distance of the earth from thesun. From that datum
he announced to the Academy, in the beginning of September, that if his supposition was
correct, an emersion of the fwst satellite, which would take place on the 16th of November
following, would happen ten minutes later than it should according to the ordinary cal-
culation.

‘*The event agreed with the prediction of M. Roémer. Notwithstanding this success, as
the idea was very new, it was not at first generally received. The savans were cautious not
to be led astray by the charms of novelty. The satellite has not for the centre of its motion
the centre of Jupiter. Moreover, its revolutions are more rapid when it is nearer the sun,
and this should produce irregularities in its motion. But these irregularities do not exactly
follow those just mentioned. They even imagined another astronomical hypothesis, which
would fulfil all the conditions, but it was too unlike anything hitherto known of the heavens.
It might satisfy the calculation, but it had not that probability which could satisfy the minds

*“We must, therefore, admit the retardation of light as probable, according to physics,
even though not proved by astronomy.”’

The admirable discovery of Roémer was made known in an article pub-
lished in the Journal des Savants of Mouday, December 7, 1676, under the
title of Demonstration touchant le mouvement de la lumiere trouvé, par M.
Roémer, del’ Academie Royale des Sciences. ‘This article, accompanied by a
figure, gives a clear and sufficiently detailed explanation of the influence of
the progressive transmission of light on the observations of the eclipses of
Jupiter’s satellites.

CONFIRMATION OF THE IDEAS OF ROEMER BY THE DISCOVERY OF THE ABER-
RATION OF LIGHT, BY BRADLEY.

The ideas of Roémer on the progressive transmission of light through space,
and the explanation that he had thence deduced of the alternate delays and
accelerations in the immersions and emersions of the first satellite of Jupiter,
although generally admitted by savans, were not, however, accepted without
dispute. ‘The point in consideration was the periodic perturbation in the move-
ment of a single celestial body—the satellit.e -According to the observations
this body was sometimes in advance of and sometimes behind the position it
ought to occupy according to the preconceived ideas of the nature of its
motion; instead of attributing these delays and accelerations to the change of
position of the observer and to the progressive transmission of light, could it
not be regarded as indicating a real perturbation in the movement of the satel-
lite, due to a cause not yet discovered? The ideas of Roémer required, there-
fore, a confirmation which would entirely relieve them of doubt. This con-
firmation was given in a remarkable manner some time after. It was fur-

nished by the discovery of aberration, made fifty years later by the celebrated
English astronomer Bradley.

This phenomenon of aberration consists in an apparent displacement which
all ‘the stars and planets experience on account of the combination of the
velocity of the earth with the velocity of light. In order to explain this we
will take another example from among familiar things, and with which we are
all acquainted.

Suppose that we are in a railroad car during a rain, without wind, so that
the drops falls vertically. When the train stops we see the rain-drops moving,
as they really do, each in a vertical line. But when the train runs on the rails,
things are completely changed. The drops now seem to fall obliquely, as if a
strong wind blew in a direction contrary to that of the train’s motion, and
obliged the vertical lines, naturally described by the rain-drops, to be inelined
in the direction of its action. It is easy to explain this. From the interior of
the car we observe what passes outside through the rectangular opening of the
window. Let us consider specially a drop of rain which we perceive near the
upper angle or corner of the window on the side in the direction of the motion.
If the car was stationary we would see the drop descend along the vertical
side of the window of which that corner is the upper extremity. But the car
moves at the same time as the rain-drop, and at the moment it arrives at the
bottom edge of the window sash it is appreciably behind the vertical edge;
the quantity it is behind is exactly the distance run over by the car while the
rain-drop was descending the whole height of the window-sash. The rain-
drop seems to run over a straight line which joins the point where it enters
the space of the window-pane and the point where it goes out; and as this
straight line has necessarily a certain obliquity, the rain-drop appears to descend
obliquely ; and all the other drops of rain moving absolutely the same as the
one we have just considered, seemed also to move in this oblique line, which
is but an appearance caused by our own motion while we look at the falling
rain. If, for example, the car progressed exactly the breadth of the window
while the rain-drop fell through a distance equal to its height, a drop appearing
in the upper corner of the window would seem to run over the diagonal drawn
to the opposite lower corner of the pane.

We will remark, in passing, that if we measure the apparent obliquity of the
rain, we can thence deduce the ratio of the velocity of the rain-drops to that
of the train, since we know the lengths of the paths run over in the same time
by the drops and by the car; and if we know one of these velocities, for
example that of the train, we can calculate the other, that of the rain. This
method, entirely practical, was proposed several years ago as furnishing the
means of accurately measuring the velocity of falling rain.

Thus from the simple fact that the observer is in motion, the bodies which
move in his neighborhood do not appear to have the motion which they have
in reality, the direction of their motion being altered by this circumstance, and
that so much the more as the velocity of the observer is greater. |

Keeping always our illustration of vertically falling rain, observed from
the interior of a railroad car in motion, suppose that the train gradually
changes its direction, and from running north to south it changes to run from
east to west. On account of the motion of the car the rain appears driven
against the train by a wind blowing from west to east. If the railroad is built
in the form of a circumference of a circle, so that the train in running over its
whole length comes again to the point of departure, the rain which really falls
vertically appears from the interior of the car to fall obliquely under the action
of a wind blowing successively from all points of the horizon.

Similar circumstances are presented when the rain, instead of falling verti-
cally, falls with a certain obliquity, caused by a wind blowing regularly. If
the wind throws the rain in a direction contrary to that of the car, the motion

een
ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 143

of the car causes the rain to appear to fall more obliquely than it really does;
if the wind blows the rain in a direction with that of the car, the obliquity
with which it really falls appears diminished, and may, according to the
circumstances, be annulled or even changed in direction; if the wind makes
any angle whatsoever with the railroad, the drops of rain will always appear
to fall behind the positions they would have if the car were at rest. In a word,
the direétion according to which the observer seated in the car sees the rain
fall is more than the real direction of the rain modified as it would be if blown
by a wind in a direction contrary to the motion of the train. If the car runs
over acircular road the influence of its movement on the apparent direction of
the fall of the rain-drops changes progressively, so that the rain seems suc-
cessively to come from different points of the heaven situate all round the
point from which it really falls.

If what has just been said is clearly understood, it will not be difficult also
to understand the phenomenon of aberration discovered by Bradley, a phe-
nomenon which presents the closest analogy with the apparent change in direc-
tion of the rain-drops of which we have just spoken. Replace the rain by the
light which comes from the stars, and the car moving on the circular railroad
by the earth which annually moves around the sun in an orbit which differs
little from a circle. The observer who perceives the light coming from the
stars, and who is carried by the earth in its annual movement around the sun,
receives that light from positions in space which differ from the directions in
which it would come to him if he were at rest. so that to allow the light to
traverse the axis of his telescope he is obliged to give it a direction different
from what it would have if lhe were not himself translated with a certain
velocity. In the example of the rain-drops observed from the interior of the
moving car, if we placed near the window a tube so directed that a drop of
rain entering the top would pass through the tube without touching the sides,
that tube would have the direction of the lines the rain appears to describe;
on the contrary, we would have to give it the true direction of the falling rain
if the car did not move. This tube stands in the place of the telescope, which
the observer so directs that the light coming from a star traverses its whole
length to arrive at his eye placed at the other end behind the eye-piece. If
the earth did not move, the telescope ought to point in the real path of the light
coming from the star—that is to say, in the straight line drawn from the
observer to the star; but the earth being in motion, the telescope has to be
directed in the,apparent path of the light, a line which indefinitely prolonged
into space would not pass through the star, but considerably in advance of it,
when we refer its position to the motion of the earth. We therefore see the
star in a point'where it does not exist, and that apparent deviation, which is
but an illusion arising from the motion of the observer in space, changes
gradually in direction as the earth moves over the different parts of its annual
orbit, so that it returns to exactly the same conditions in the course of a year.
Each star, therefore, seems to revolve around its real position, which point we
do not see; and the angular distance which separates it from that real position
depends not upon the distance which exists between us and it, but solely on
the ratio which exists between the velocity of light and the velocity of the
earth. If the two velocities were comparable, that is to say, if the ratio of the
greater to the smaller was not a very large number of units, which is the case
with the velocity of falling rain compared to the velocity of the train, the
apparent deviation of which we have spoken would be very considerable, like
the deviation we observe in the falling rain when we are in a ear, which from
a state of rest commences to run rapidly over the rail. If, on the contrary,
the velocity of light were incomparably greater than that of the earth, and as
infinity compared with the latter, the apparent deviation of the rays of light,
due to the velocity of the earth, would be extremely small, and might, on
144 ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

account of its minuteness, escape our investigations, notwithstanding the pre-
cision of the means of observation employed by modern astronomy. But
neither of these cases is presented for our consideration; it is true that the
velocity of the earth is very small compared to that of light, but not so small
that the apparent deviation due to the velocity of displacement of the observer
is insensible: this deviation, for its maximum, is about 20 seconds of a degree,
a quantity not only appreciable, but also even measurable with great precision
by the aid of the instruments which now exist in observatories. ion

It is in this apparent deviation of each star, a deviation which changes in diree-
tion from one period of the year to another, so that the star appears to revolve
annually around its real position, that consists the phenomenon of aberration
discovered by Bradley. We will content ourselves with having given in what
precedes a general idea of the cause of the phenomenon, and we will not en-
deavor to show how by setting out from the causes indicated we can find the
laws it follows during the different times of the year. We will simply state
that the total apparent motion which results to each star takes place in an
ellipse whose greater axis, as it is for all the stars, is seen under an angle of
about forty seconds of a degree; this greater axis is always directed parallel
to the ecliptic. As to the smaller axis of the ellipse, it varies from one star to
another, and it is so much the smaller as the star is nearer the ecliptic: equal
to the greater axis for a star situate at the pole of the ecliptic, reduced to zero
for a star situate directly on the ecliptic. The ellipse of aberration, therefore,
corresponds with a circle at the pole of the ecliptic, and in going from that pole
it becomes more and more flattened as the star to which it corresponds is found
nearer to the ecliptic, so as to be reduced to a simple straight line of a length
equal to the greater axis for each star situate on this great circle of the sphere.

As it often happens in the science of observation, Bradley discovered aberra-
tion without seeking for it. Molyneux had placed at Kew, near London, an
instrument constructed with the greatest care by the celebrated Graham, and
destined to observe with all possible precision the passage of stars near the
zenith. 'The object that astronomers had in view was to arrive at some precise
data of the annual parallax of the stars. We know that the annual parallax
of the stars is the displacement with respect to each other which the different
stars ought to appear to us to have at different periods of the year, because we
successively see them from different points of the orbit of the earth, so that,
in going from some and in approaching others, we see them under different
aspects as the earth carries us in its motion around the sun. Since the
general adoption of the system of Copernicus, astronomers were desirous to
prove the existence of that annual parallax which is a necessary consequence,
and which would be regarded as an incontestable proof of the truth of this
system. With the instrument of Molyneux were made the first observations
which led to the discovery of aberration. The following is his account of the
discovery, given in a letter to Halley :*

‘*Mr. Molyneux’s apparatus was completed and fitted for observing about the end of
November, 1725, and on the 3d day of December following the bright star in the head of
Draco (marked y by Bayer) was for the first time observed as it passed near the zenith, and
its situation carefully taken with the instrument. The like observations were made on the

Sth, lith, and 12th days of the same month, and there appearing no material difference in -

the place of the star, a further repetition of them at this season seemed needless, it being a
part of the year wherein no sensible alteration of parallax in this star could soon be expected.
it was chiefly, therefore, curiosity that tempted me (being then at Kew, where the instrument
was fixed) to prepare for observing the star on December 17, when, having adjusted the
instrument as usual, I perceived that it passed a little more southerly this day than when it
was observed before. Not suspecting any other cause of this appearance, we first concluded

that it was owing to the uncertainty of the observations, and that either this or the foregoing
were not so exact as we had before supposed, for which reason we purposed to repeat the
observation again, in order to ‘determine from whence this difference proceeded, and upon
doing it, on December 20, I found that the star passed still more southerly than on the former
observations. This sensible alteration the more surprised us, in that it was the contrary way
from what it would have been had it proceeded from an annual parallax of the star; but
being now, pretty well satisfied that it could not be entirely owing to the want of exactness
in the observations, and having no notion of anything else that could cause such an appa-
rent motion as this in the star, we began to think that some change in the materials, &c., of
the instrument itself might have occasioned it. Under these apprehensions we remained
some time, but being at length fully convinced, by several trials, of the great exactnoss of
the instrument, and finding, by the gradual increase of the star’s distance from the pole, that
there must be some recular cause that produced it, we took care to examine nicely, at the
time of each observation, how much it was, and about the beginning of March, 1726, the star
was found to be twenty seconds more southerly than at the time of tho first observation. It
now seemed to have arrived at its utmost limit southward, because, in several trials made
about this time, no sensible difference was observed in its situation. By the middle of April
it appeared to be returning back again towards the north, and about the beginning of June
it passed at the same distance from the zenith as it had done in December, when it was first
observed.

‘From the quick alteration of this star’s declination about this time, (it increased a second
in three days, ) it was concluded that it would now proceed northward, as it before had gone
southward, of its present situation; and it happened as was conjectured, for the star con-
tinued to move northward till September following, when it again became stationary, being
then near twenty seconds more northerly than in June, and no less than thirty-nine secouds
more northerly than it was in March. From September the star returned towards the south,
till it arrived, in December, to the same situation it was in at that time twelve months, allow-
ing for the differenco of declination on account of the precession of the equinox.

‘«This was a sufficient proof that the instrument had not been the cause of this apparent
motion of the star, and to find one adequate to an effect seemed a difficulty. A mutation of
the earth’s axis was one of the first things that offered itself upon this occasion, but it was
soon found to be insufiicient; for though it might have accounted for the change of declina-
tion in y Draconis, yet it would not at the same time agree with the phenomena in other stars,
particularly in a small one almost opposite, in right ascension, to y Draconis, at about the
same distance from the north pole of the equator; for though this star seemed to move the
sameway, as a mutation of the earth's axis would have made it, yet (it changing its decli-
nation but about half as much as y Draconis in the same time, as appeared upon comparing
the observations of both, made upon the same days, at different seasons of the year) this
plainly proved that the apparent motion of the stars was not occasioned by a real mutation,
since, if that had been the cause, the alteration in both stars would have been nearly equal.

“The great regularity of the observations left no room to doubt but that there was some
regular cause that produced this unexpected motion, which did not depend on the uncertainty
or variety of the seasons of the year. Upon comparing the observations with each other, it
was discovered that in both the before-mentioned stars the apparent difference of declination
from the maxima was always nearly proportional to the versed sine* of the sun’s distance
from the equinoctial points. This was an inducement to think that the cause, whatever it
was, had some relation to the sun’s situation with respect to these. points. But not being
able to frame any hypothesis, at that time, sufficient to solve all the phenomena, and being
very desirous to search a little further into this matter, I began to think of erecting an instru-
ment for myself at Wansted, that, having it always at band, I might, with the more ease and
certainty, inquire into the laws of this new motion. The consideration, likewise, of being
able, by another instrument, to confirm the truth of the observations hitherto made with Mr.
Molyneux’s was no small inducement to me; but the chief cause of all was the opportunity
L should thereby have of trying in what manner other stars were affected by the same cause,
whatever it was; for Mr. Molyneux’s instrument being originally designed for observing y
Draconis, (in order, as I said before, to try whether it had any sensible parallax,) was so
contrived as to be capable of but little alteration in its direction—not above seven or eight
minutes of a degree—and there being few stars within half that distance from the zenith of
Kew bright enough to be well observed, he could not, with his instrument, thoroughly ex-
amino how this cause affected stars differently situated with respect to the equinoctial and
solstitial points of the ecliptic.

‘* These considerations determined me; and by the contrivance and direction of the same
ingenious person, Mr. Graham, my instrument was fixed up August 19, 1727. As I had no
convenient place where I could make use of so long a telescope as Mr. Molyneux’s, I con
tented myself with one of but little more than half the length of his, (viz: of about 124 feet,

his being 241,) judging, from the experience which I already had, that this radius would be
long enough to adjust the instrument to a sufficient degree of exactness, and I have had no
reason since to change my opinion, for, from all the trials I have yet made, I am very well
satisfied that, when it is carefully rectified, its situation may be securely depended upon to
half a second. As the place where my instrument was to be hung in some measure deter-
mined its radius, so did it also the length of the arch, or limb, on which the divisions were
made to adjust it, for the arch could not conveniently be extended further than to reach to
about six and one-fourth degrees on each side my zenith. This, indeed, was sufficient, since
it gave me an opportunity of making choice of several stars, very different both in magnitude
and situation, there being more than two huadred inserted in the British catalogue that may
be observed with it. I needed not to have extended the limb so far, but that I was willing
to take in Capella, the only star of the first magnitude that comes so near my zenith.

‘‘ My instrument being fixed, I immediately began to observe such stars as I judged most
proper to give me light into the cause of the motion already mentioned. There was variety
enough of small ones, and not less than twelve that I could observe through all seasons of
the year, they being bright enough to be seen in the day-time, when nearest the sun.”

Bradley here enters into some details on the results which he obtained in the
observations on different stars. He then adds:

‘‘When the year was completed I began to examine and compare my observations, and
having pretty well satisfied myself as to the general laws of the phenomena, I then endea-
vored to find out the cause of them. I was already convinced that the apparent motion of
the stars was not owing to a mutation of the earth’s axis. The next thing that offered itself
was an alteration in the direction of the plumb-line with which the instrument was constantly
rectified; but this, upon trial, proved insufficient. Then I considered what refraction might
do; but here, also, nothing satisfactory occurred. At last I conjectured that all the pheno-
mena hitherto mentioned proceeded from the progressive motion of light and the earth’s annual
motion in its orbit, for I perceived that, if light was propagated in time, the apparent place
of a fixed object would not be the same when the eye is at rest as when it is moving in any
other direction than that of the line passing through the eye and object, and that when the
eye is moving in different directions the apparent place of the object would be different.”’

Bradley examines then, in detail, the apparent positions which the stars
should have from the combination of the velocity of the earth with the velocity
of the propagation of light through space, and he finds a perfect agreement
between the results thus arrived at and those furnished by observation. ‘This
change in position of the stars which he had studied with such care was there-
fore explained, and he was enabled also, from the magnitude of these changes
of position, to determine the ratio of the velocity of light to the velocity of
translation of the earth. In making this determination from the data given by
his observations on the various stars he had studied, he arrives at very con-
cordant results, whence he concludes that the greater axis of the ellipse of aber-
ration, which is the same for all the stars, has an amplitude of forty and a half
seconds. It follows that the velocity of light is 10,188 times greater than the
velocity of the earth, (the mean velocity being understood,) so that the light
ought to take eight minutes and thirteen seconds to come from the sun to us.
Bradley, referring here to the discovery of Roémer, says:

“Tt is well known that Mr. Roémer, who first attempted to account for an apparent
inequality in the times of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites by the hypothesis of the progres-
sive motion of light, supposed that it spent about eleven minutes of time in its passage from
the sun to us, but it hath since been concluded by others, from the like eclipses, that it is
propagated as far in about seven minutes. The velocity of light, therefore, deduced from
the foregoing hypothesis, is, as it were, a mean betwixt what had at different times been
determined from the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites.”

After the discovery .of Bradley, the progressive transmission of light became
an incontestable fact. Here we do not consider merely the perturbation affeet-
ing the position of a single star as in the phenomenon discovered by Roémer,
a perturbation that we might, in truth, regard as really existing in the motion
of the satellite, although we might not be able to give the ultimate cause. But
in the new phenomenon discovered by Bradley we observe all the stars sub-
jected to a perturbation of the same nature, all following the same laws, and
not varying from each other, but by reason of their different positions relatively
to the ecliptic. This general perturbation, evidently owing to a single general

‘cause, irrespective of each individual star, is explained most satisfactorily by
the hypothesis of the progressive transmission of light, and the result is in per-
feet accord with the deductions of Roémer, from the observations of the eclipses
of Jupiter’s satellites. Such an agreement of circumstances does not allow of
the least doubt as to the truth of Roémer’s conception. ;

We will remark, in passing, that aberration, which is a result due to the com-
bination of the velocity of light with the velocity of the earth, in its annual
movement around the sun, furnished at the same time a proof in favor of the
system of Copernicus—a proof which had, up to that period, been vainly sought
in the annual parallax of the stars.

‘This phenomenon, discovered, studied, and so well explained by Bradley,
had not remained entirely unknown before his time. In fact, in the work of
Picard, entitled Voyage d’ Uranibourg, speaking cf the different values which
Tycho had found, for the height of the pole at his observatory of Uranibourg,
we read the following passage:

‘* Besides that, there is an obstacle in the way of the use of the polar star, (for determining
the height of the pole,) which, from one season to another, experiences certain variations
which l'yeho had not remarked, and which I observed nearly ten years ago, which consists
in this—that, although the polar star approaches continually the pole* by about twenty
seconds, it nevertheless happens that towards the month of April the inferior meridian height
of that star becomes less, by several seconds, than it appeared at the preceding winter sol-
stice, instead of which it should have been greater by five seconds, and, consequently, in the
months of August and September its superior meridian height is found to be nearly that which
it was observed to have in winter, and sometimes even greater, although it ought to have
diminished from ten to fifteen seconds; but, finally, towards the end of the year all is com-
aig td so that the polar star appears nearer to the pole by about twenty seconds than it
was before.

There is no denying that we have here the annual change of position due to
aberration. Picard adds, a little further on:

‘“To tell the truth, I have not as yet been able to imagine any explanation that satisties
me.”

Delambre, who cites these passages in his Histoire de l’ Astronomie Moderne,
t. ii, page 616, accompanies them with the following reflection :

“When Roémer, brought into 'rance by Picard, measured the velocity of light, he little
imagined, notwithstanding the identity of the annual period, that his discovery had anything
in common with those variations which had for so long troubled Picard, who, no doubt, had
often spoken of them.”

In the two phenemena, of which we have successively spoken, the progres-
sive transmission of light does not play the same part. If the observations of
the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites unveiled to Roémer a periodic perturbation,
agreeing with the successive augmentations and diminutions of the distance of
Jupiter from the earth, that is owing to the time the light employs to traverse
the earth’s orbit; the velocity of the earth has nothing to do with the ampli-
tude of the phenomenon, which depends entirely on the dimensions of its orbit.
_In the phenomenon of aberration, on the contrary, it is the velocity of the earth
which is principally concerned ; and it is of little consequence whether its orbit
be small or large. If we transport ourselves in thought to the planet Mars,
which describes an orbit of larger dimensions than the earth, but which at the
same time moves with a less velocity, we will sec that the two phenomena of
which we speak will vary as to their magnitude in an inverse manner: the
eclipses of the first satcllite of Jupiter will appear to experience a greater per-
turbation, and the aberration of the stars will be less. The contrary will happen
if we place ourselves on the planet Venus, which has a greater velocity of
translation than the earth, and runs over a smaller orbit: the aberration of the

‘stars will be augmented, and the eclipses of the first satellite of Jupiter will
present in their succession a smaller perturbation.

The observations of the immersions of Jupiter’s satellites present some un-
‘certainty, as these bodies traverse the penumbra of Jupiter before entering the
pure umbra; so that in their movement around the planet, the latter screens them
gradually from the sun’s rays until they are completely cut off; so that the
light of a satellite in eclipsing, insensibly decreases to total extinetion. ‘The
time of the satellite’s eclipse may therefore vary, according as we make use of
‘a telescope of greater or less power, and as the atmosphere is more or less
transparent. ‘The same remarks apply to the emersions of the satellites. On
the other hand, in supposing that the times of immersions and of emersions
have been exactly observed, it is further necessary, in the irregularities which
the succession of these phenomena present, to eliminate what is due to the eccen-
tricity of the orbit of the satellite, and to the perturbations with which it is
really affected, from what is but an appearance arising from the progressive
transmission of light. It is for these reasons that the first satellite is selected
as the most proper to furnish the data for the determination of the velocity of
light; the greater velocity of its motion and the small depth of the penumbra
*at the point where it crosses it, causes it to lose its light more rapidly than the
other satellites; also the almost entire absence of eccentricity in its orbit renders
its motion more regular, and thus gives more prominence to the irregularity due
to the time that the light takes to traverse the orbit of the earth. But we can
never arrive at but a rough approximation of the velocity of light as deduced
from the observations of the eclipses of this satellite, as Bradley has shown in
the last paragraph cited from his letter; since the results arrived at by this
means, for the time employed by the light to come from the sun to the earth,
varies from seven to eleven minutes.

The phenomena of aberration furnish far more precise data for the determin-
ation of the velocity of light. As all the stars are affected by aberration, we
ean multiply at will observations which have a great degree of precision.
Bradley estimates that the error in hig determination of eight minutes and thir-
teen seconds for the light to travel from the sun to the earth cannot exceed
ten seconds.

Employing the most exact means of modern science, Mr. W. Struve, director
of the Central Russian Observatory, near St. Petersburg, made numerous ob-
servations during three years (from April, 1840, to the end of 1842) to obtain
the exact value of aberration. In discussing these observations, he found that
the half of the greater axis of aberration, which is the same for all stars, has
an amplitude of 20.45 seconds; whence it results that the velocity of light is
10,089 times greater than the mean velocity of the earth in its orbit.

The earth employing 365} days to run over its orbit, light takes 10,089 times

less, namely 52 minutes and 8 seconds, to go over a line of the same length;

and regarding that orbit as the cireumference of a circle, we have but to divide
52 minutes 8 seconds by twice the ratio of the circumference to the diameter
(3.1416,) to have the time employed in traversing its radius—that is to say, the
mean distance of the sun from the earth. We thus find 8 minutes 18 seconds
the number which is now adopted by all astronomers.

The observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s first satellite, and those of the
phenomena of aberration, lead directly, as we have just seen, although with a
different degree of approximation, to the determination of the time light occupies
to run over the mean distance of the sun from the earth. ''o deduce from this
the absolute value of the velocity of light referred to our ordinary units of
length, the metre, (the foot or the mile,) we must know how many metres (miles)
are contained in the distance from the sun to the earth. ‘The value of this
distance is found by means of the parallax of the sun; we designate thus the
angle under which, being at the sun’s centre, we would see the radius of the

ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF ‘LIGHT. 149

earth. ‘The sun’s parallax, calculated from the observations of the last transit
of Venus over the disk of the sun in 1769, is fixed at 8.57 seconds; hence the
distance of the sun from the earth is equal to 24,109 times the radius of the
earth, or to 153,500,000 kilometres (or to 95,384,900 miles.) As this length
is run over by the light in 8 minutes 18 seconds or in 498 seconds, we conclude
that the velocity of light is 308,000 kilometres (or 191,391 miles) in one second.
However, for some years several circumstances have conspireu to make us
believe that the determination of 8.57 seconds given as the value of the sun’s
parallax is too small, and that the parallax ought to be augmented by 2 quan-
tity not less than the thirtieth of its value, which would elevate it to about 8.9
seconds. From this increase in parallax:results a diminution in the earth’s dis-
tance from the sun, and consequently in the distance gone over in 8 minutes
18 seconds by the light; the velocity of light will therefore be reduced to a little
less than 300,000 kilometres (or 186,420 miles) in a second. 'The next transit
of Venus,* which will happen in 1874, cannot fail to set at rest all doubts which

‘may yet remain on this point.

THE EXPERIMENT PROJECTED BY ARAGO TO DETERMINE THE VELOCITY OF
LIGHT. t

The velocity of light, diseovered and determined by the labors of which we
have just spoken, was entered as an established fact among the truths of sci-
ence. Turther researches could at most only lead to a oveater precision in its
determination, already approximated so closely by Bradley. The magnitude
of that velocity, so great that in one second it runs over more than seven and a
half times the circumference of the earth, would cause us to consider the
dimensions of the earth as far too small to serve as a basis for an experimental
determination of its value; the incomparably greater dimension of the earth’s
annual orbit was not more than sufficient to reveal to Roémer, from his obser
vations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s first satellite, that prodigious velocity, aie
we would naturally think that the measure of the velocity of light, which.
from its nature, really belongs to the province of experimental phy: sies, would
never depart from the domain of pleted Nevertheless, as we will soon
see, this recently did take place in the most brilliant manner

The first step in this direction was the most difficult to waned: and it required
all the daring of genius to attempt it. We find it in an experiment projected
by Arago, and communicated to the Academy of Sciences of Paris during its
mecting on the 3d of December, 1838. In the project it was not as yet pro-
posed to measure the velocity of light, but simply to compare the velocities
with which light moves in air, or in a liquid such as water, or bisulphide of
carbon; it was proposed to find by experiment which of these two velocities
was the greater, which would decide in an irrefutable manner st tae the two

systems imagined by physicists to explain optical phenomena, viz: the system

.

* The observation ol the transit of the planet Venus across the disk of the sun is by far the
most precise means that we can employ to determine the value of the parallax of the sun.

t Before proceeding further in the perusal of the essay of M. Delaunay, it is necessary
that all who have not given especial attention to the study of recent optical research, and
who desire to appreciate the beauty and importance of the remainder of this essay, should
understand wlty light should move faster in water than in air according to the emission
theory, and slower in water than in air according to the undulatory theory. This is not
explained by the author, and without this knowl ledge it is impossible to appreciate the
excellence of these classical experiments of Arago, of b'izeau, and of Foucault.

We would advise the above class of readers to study the points here spoken of in the
‘*Lectures on the Undulating Theory of Light,” by Professor Barnard, Smithsonian R eport

cf emission and that of vibration or undulation. We cannot do better than
here allow Arago to speak for himself. ‘The following is what he says in the
notice printed in the proceedings of the mecting :*

‘*T propose to show in this communication how it is possible to decide, unequivocally,
whether light be composed of little particles emanating trom radiating bodies, as Newton
supposes, and as the greater part of modern geometers admit; or whether it is simply the
result of the undulations of a very rare and very elastic medium which physicists have
agreed to call ether. The system of experiments which I am about to describe will no
longer permit, it seems to me, to hesitate between these two rival theories. It will decide
mathematically, (L use designedly this expression ;) it will decide mathematically cne of the
grandest and most debated questions of natural philosophy.

‘‘ Besides, my communication is the fuifilling of a sort of engagement to the Academy I
accepted at one of its last secret sittings. piel omelet

“fT discussed the admirable method, by the aid of which Mr. Wheatstone attempted the
solution of the problem of the velocity of electricity over metallic conductors. I had hardly
terminated the enumeration of the important results obtained by that ingenious physicist,
when several of our members, whose names are authority in such matters, stated that my
report was far too approbative. ‘In supposing it well determined, the inferior limit assigned
by Mr. Wheatstone to the velocity of electricity will not have,’ said one, ‘any marked
influence on the progress of the sciences; besides, limits of the same order, and even more
extensive, can be deduced indirectly from various electric or magnetic phenomena, As to
che method of the revolving mirrors, it does not seem to be susceptible of application, but to
the simple questions already studied by the inventor.’ I tried to refute this last opinion. I
believed myself that the new instrument, suitably modified, would lead to results that Mr.
Wheatstone was not aware of. I already foresaw that, even in supposing it enclosed in
the narrow limits of a small room, it could serve to measure the comparative velocities of
light moving through air and through a liquid. I was not slow in learning, and without
hhaving hardly the right to be astonished or to complain that my assertion had been received
with incredulity. Nevertheless, I intend to vindicate it to-day in all its parts.

‘‘Principle of the method: Let a ray of light fall upon a plane polished mirror; it will
be reflected, as every one knows, in forming with the surface of the mirror an angle of
reflection exactly equal to the angle of incidence.

‘*Let us now suppose that the mirror turns through an are @ around the point of its
surface from which the reflection takes place. If this motion, for example, increases by the
quantity a, the original angle of incidence, it will diminish as much the original angle of
reflection. The latter will, therefore, after the displacement of the mirror, be smaller than
the first by the quantity 2a; thus it must be increased 2a to render it equal to the new angle
of incidence; hence that angle increased 2a will give the direction of the reflected ray in the
second position or the mirror; and thus the incident ray remaining the same, an angular
motion @ of the mirror occasions a double angular motion in the reflected ray.

‘This mode of reasoning applies as well to the case where the motion of the mirror,
acting in a contrary direction, would diminish the first angle of incidence. The principle
is, therefore, general; and it is also that of all reflecting nautical instruments.

‘The redection from the plane mirrors can serve to project the luminous rays in all parts of
space, without, however, altering the relative positions; two rays parallel before reflection
will be parallel after their reflection; those at first inclined to cach other 1 minute, 10
minutes, or 20 minutes, &c., will form precisely the same angle after the reflection has
deviated them. ‘

‘‘ Instead of a single ray, let us consider two horizontal rays setting out from two neigh-
boring points situate in the same vertical. Admit that they strike on two points of the
median line (also vertical) of a plane vertical mirror. Suppose that this mirror revolves on
itself uniformly and in a continuous manner around a vertical axis whose prolongation
coincides with the median line just mentioned, the direction in which the twe horizontal
lines will be reflected will depeud evidently upon the moment they may reach the mirror,
since we have supposed that it turns. If the two rays have set out simultancously from the
two contiguous radiating points, they will also reach simultaneously the mirror. ‘Their
reflection will take place at the same instant; consequently in the same position of the
turning surface; consequentiy as if that surface was stationary with respect to them.
Therefore their primitive paraliclism will not be changed.

“Tn order that the rays which primitively were parallel may diverge after their reflection,
it is necessary that one of them should arrive at the mirror later than the other. It is
necessary that in its course from the radiating point to the reflecting and turning surface,
the velocity of the ray should be accelerated, or what will be precisely the same thing, it is
necessary (the velocity of the tirst ray remaining constant) that that of the second should
experience a diminution. It is necessary, finally, that the two rays should be reflected one
after the other; and, consequently, from two distinct positions of the muror. forming with
each other a sensible angle.

** According to the theory of emission, light moves in water notably faster than in air.
According to the wave theory, it is precisely the opposite which takes place: the light
moves faster in air than in water. Suppose that one of the rays (the upper ray, for example)
has to traverse a tube filled with water before it strikes the mirror. If the theory of emission
be true, the wpper ray will be accelerated in its progress; it will reach the mirror first; it
will be reflected before the lower ray; it will make with it a certain angle, and the direction
of the deviation will be such that the lower ray will appear in advance of the other, that it
will appear to have been deviated more by the turning mirror.

‘‘Circumstances remaining the same, let us admit fora moment the truth of the wave
system. The tube of water will retard the progress of the upper ray; the ray will arrive at
the reflecting mirror after the lower ray; it will be reflected not the first, as in the former
case, but the second in order, and from a position of the polished reflecting face in advance
of the position it had when it reflected the upper ray a moment before; these two rays will
make with each other the same angie as in the other hypothesis, except (and we should well
remark it) the deviation will take place precisely in an opposite direction; the upper ray
will now be in advance, always indicating thus the direction in which the mirror revolves.

“To recapitulate: two radiating points, placed near each other on the same vertical line,
flash instantaneously before a revolving mirror. The rays from the upper point cannot reach
the mirror until atier traversing a tube filled with water; the rays from the second point
arrive at the mirror without meeting in their course any other medium than the air. ‘lo be
more definite, we will suppose that the mirror, seen from the position the observer occupies,
turns from the right to the left. Well, if the theory of emission be true; if light be material,
the upper point will appear to the left of the lower point. It will appear to tis right, on the
contrary, ii light results from the vibrations of an ethereal medium. ~

*‘Instead of two isolated radiating points, suppose that we instantaneously present to the
mirror a vertical lunrinous line. The image of the upper part of this line-will be formed by
rays which have traversed the water; the image of the lower part will result from the rays
which have throughout their whole course traversed the air. In the reyolving mirror the
image of the singie line will appear broken; it will be composed of two vertical luminous
lines, of two lines, which will not be prelongations of each other.

‘‘ The upper rectilinear image, is it behind the one below! Does it appear to its left?

““ Light is « body.

*“* Does the contrary take place? The upper image, does it show itself to the right?

“Light ts an undulation.

** All that precedes is theoretically, or rather speculatively exact. Now, (and here is the
delicate point, ) it remains to prove that, notwithstanding the prodigious velocity of light,
that notwithstanding a velocity of 190,000 miles a second, that notwithstanding the small
length that we will be obliged to give to the tube filled with liquid, that notwithstanding the
limited velocities of rotation that the mirrors will have, the comparative deviations of the
two images, towards the right or towards the left, of which I have demonstrated the exist-
ence, will be perceptible in our instruments.”

Arago then enters into the most minute details of all the parts of the experi-
ment: the velocity of rotation that can be given to a mirror, the visibility of
the image formed by light after having traversed the necessary length of liquid,
the possibility of reducing that length of liquid, or the velocity of rotation of
the mirror by employing simultaneously several rotating mirrors from which
the light would be successively reflected, and also in substituting for water
bisulphide of carbon, which acts more powerfully on the velocity of the light,
are, on his part, the objects of a thorough examination. He then terminates
thus:

‘* Suppose in the experiment that I propose to execute we make use of electric sparks, or
of lights successively screened and unscreened by the use of rotating disks, as their emis-

sions should only last during a tew thousandths of a second, it may happen that an observer,

looking in the mirror from a given direction, and with a telescope of limited field, will only
by chance perceive the light. To this I immediately reply that in renewing very often the
apparitions of light—every second, for example—that if, instead of a single mirror, we rotate
a vertical prism of eight or of ten facets, that with the concurrence of several observers,
placed in different directions, and each with his telescope, we cannot fail to have numerous
and clear apparitions of the reflected rays. But these are details on which I shall not dweli
to-day. I will reserve for another communication the exposition of the system of experi-
ments in which we will render sensible, and in which we will measure, to a certain degree,
the absolute velocity of light without having recourse to celestial phenomena.”

After the publication of’ this remarkable notice we could not doubt the suc-

cess of the experiment it detailed. But, not to interrupt the chronological order,
we should speak first of an entircly different experiment, by which the direct

measure of the velocity of light was first accomplished on the surface of the
earth.
MEASURE OF THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT, BY M. FIZEAU,.

If we refer to the first pages of this essay we will there see indicated a very
simple means that was first mentioned as suitable for the determination of the
velocity of light, a method which would certainly have long ago furnished the
value of that velocity if the transmission of light in space was not effected
with such amazing velocity. Itis this method, barely modified, that M. Fizeau
has put into practice, and which he has rendered completely successful by
employing a process as simple as ingenious for measuring the excessively short
time that the light takes in running over a distance of several kilometres, or a
few miles.

We have supposed that two lamps, A and B, were placed at a distance of
several kilometres from each other, and that we shut off suddenly the light of
A by means of a screen, then the very instant that the disappearance of the
light of the lamp A was perceived at B, we screened B likewise, the interval
of time which elapsed between the instant that the lamp A was screened and
that when the disappearance of the light of lamp B was perceived at A is
evidently the time employed by the light to run over twice the distance which
separates the lamps. M. Fizeau replaced the lamp B by a mirror destined to
receive and to reflect perpendicularly to its surface the light of the other lamp.
In this manner the observer stationed near the lamp <A, and looking at the
mirror just spoken of, ought to see the image of the lamp A; if this lamp is
suddenly screened he should see its image disappear in the mirror, not imme-
diately, but after a certain interval of time—that which the light takes to run
over double the distance of the lamp from the mirror.

To measure the interval of time spoken of M. Fizeau made use of a disk
toothed at its circumference like a cog-wheel, so that this disk presented on its
periphery a succession of equal intervals alternately open and closed. If we
rapidly turn such a disk in its plane and around its centre, the closed and
open spaces formed by the cogs and the intervening openings will pass suc-
cessively before the same point in space, and the time employed by each tooth
or by each opening to come to the place previously occupied by a tooth or by
an opening can easily be reduced to a very small fraction of a second. In
placing the apparatus so that the teeth of the turning disk pass in succession
before the light of the lamp near the observer, these teeth will act like screens —
which periodically intercept the light. If the time employed by each opening
to come to the place occupied by the next preceding cog or tooth is precisely
that required by the light to go from the lamp to the mirror and from the mir-
ror back again to the lamp, the observer, stationed quite near to this lamp and
looking through the openings of the turning disk as they pass before his eye,
ought to see through each epening the extinction of light caused by the
passage of the preceding tooth before the lamp. This eclipse of the lamp,
produced during the whole time of the passage of the tooth before its light, is
perceived by the observer during the whole time of the transit of the following
opening ; and as the light of the lamp wheu it passes through an opening of
the disk, after its reflection from the mirror, meets the tooth which is now in
the place of this opening, it follows that the observer does not perceive at all
the image of the lamp in the mirror during all the time that the disk revolves
with the special velocity with which we have supposed it endowed.

After what has just been said it is easily understood what will happen when,
the apparatus adjusted, we commence by giving to the disk a gradually in-
creasing velocity of rotation. The disk first turning with an extreme slowness,
the observer, who has his eye quite near the side of the lamp and who looks
in the direction of the mirror, sees the teeth and the openings of the disk sue,

ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 153

cessively pass before him; when an opening passes, the light of the lamp
passes through, falls on the mirror, and comes back to the eye in passing
through the same opening which has hardly been displaced during its passage ;
soon a tooth presents itself, the light of the lamp is intercepted, and the eye
sees nothing more; a new opening follows the tooth, and the eye receives the
light reflected from the mirror, and so on continuously ; the eye, therefore, re-
eeives the light in an interrupted manner, with a series of extinctions caused
by the passage of the teeth of the disk. If we increase the velocity of rota-
tion of the disk these successive apparitions of the light are brought nearer
and nearer to each other, and as the impression caused by the light on the
retina lasts some time, about the tenth of a second, after the light has ceased
to penetrate the eye, when the velocity of the disk is so great that each tooth
takes less than one-tenth of a second to pass before the eye, the sensation pro-
duced by the light which has passed an opening has not yet vanished when
the following opening arrives and renews it; therefore there is no interruption
in the sensation, and the eye sees the light of the lamp reflected from the mir-
ror without any intermission; only the intensity of that permanent light which
it perceives is notably weaker than it would be if the teeth of the disk did not
pass before the lamp, since the half of the light which it emits in the direction
of the mirror is intercepted by the teeth which pass successively before it.
When this continuity in the light is obtained by a sufficient velocity of the
disk, we are yet far from the particular condition indicated above as giving the
experiment which can serve to determine the velocity of light; the light which
passes from the lamp through an opening of the disk can be reflected from the
mirror almost without loss, and return to strike the eye after having passed the
same opening; the last portion of this light, that which is emitted when the
following tooth is on the point of passing before the eye, can alone be inter-
cepted by this tooth when they return from the mirror to the eye. If we still
continue gradually to increase the velocity of the disk, these last portions of
the total light emitted through an opening which are intercepted in their return
by the following tooth, increase little by little in importance relatively to that
total quantity of light, and in consequence the intensity of the light received
by the eye gradually decreases. Finally, when the velocity of the disk has
so increased that the time employed by its circumference to progress a distance
equal to the breadth of an opening or of a tooth equals the time the light
employs to go from the lamp to the mirror and back again to the lamp, the cye
perceives nothing at all. The light sent by the lamp in the direction of the
mirror is completely intercepted by the teeth of the disk, as follows: half by
the anterior faces of these teeth as they pass before the lamp, and the other
half by the posterior faces of these same teeth after the light, having traversed
the openings, is reflected back by the mirror. If we increase yet more the
velocity of rotation of the disk, each tooth passes too rapidly to intercept the
whole of the returning light which passed through the preceding opening and
was sent back by the mirror; a portion of that light can therefore pass through
the opening which follows that tovth and strike the eye, which begins again
to perceive feebly the image of the lamp in the mirror. 'The velocity of the
disk still increasing, the intensity of the image increases also until the disk
turns twice as rapidly as it did the moment the eye perceived no light. Now,
in fact, all the light which has passed through an opening meets on its return
from the mirror the following opening which has taken the position of the first,
and it can enter the eye without the disk intercepting the smallest portion. It
is easy to sce that, by still adding to the velocity of the disk, the image of the
lamp, seen by reflection in the mirror, again commences to become faint, again
to be totally eclipsed, to reappear again, and so on as far as it is possible to
give increased velocities to the disk. If we observe with care the instant when
the first of these successive eclipses is completely produced, and if we then
154 ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

measure the velocity of rotation of the disk, we can easily calculate the time
required by a tooth to take the same position as was just before occupied by.
the next preceding opening ; and, as this time is precisely that employed by
the light to run over twice the distance of the mirror from the lamp, it is easy
thence to deduce the value of the velocity of light. Such is, in principle, the
mode of arrangement of the apparatus of M. Fizeau. We will now give such
an account of the details as will convey a clear idea of this apparatus.

In the explanation which precedes, we have supposed that the cye of the
observer is placed very near the lamp and looks in the direction in which the
lamp sends its light to the mirror, so that the incident ray, setting out from the
lamp, and the reflected ray, coming back from the mirror, to strike the eye, follow
one and the same path. Such conditions seem very difficult to obtain; but all
difficulty disappears by using a transparent glass plate, which, being inclined
45 degrees on the direction of the luminous rays, reflects to a right angle a
part of these rays from its surface, whilst the remaining portion traverses it:
without change of direction. Such a glass plate being placed before the eye,
with an inclination of 45 degrees on the line drawn from the eye to the mirror,
the lamp can be placed laterally, so as to send its light on the glass perpen-
dicularly to that line; the glass reflects towards the mirror a portion of the
light it thus receives from the lamp; that light, after being reflected, returns
to the glass plate, part of which passes through it to reach the eye.

Rays of light which emanate from a luminous source diverge to all points
around their place of origin; it follows that the further a given surface is from
the source of light, the less it must receive. If we therefore do not adopt some
particular means in the experiment we are engaged in, the mirror, placed at
several kilometres from the lamp, will receive only an insignificant quantity of
light ; moreover, only a very small part of that light will come back to strike
on the eye, so that we would really perceive nothing. In order that the light
may not thus be lost in surrounding space by the divergence of its rays, we
employ converging lenses placed one near the source of light and the other
near the mirror. ‘These lenses are so disposed that the rays radiating from
the lamp, after having traversed the first lens, become parallel and form a
beam which falls without loss upon the second lens; after having passed
through the second lens and converged towards its focus, where is placed the
mirror, they are reflected, come back to the lens, which renders them anew
parallel for their return to the point of departure; then they pass through the
first lens, which causes them again to converge, and finally they are viewed
by the eye aided with an ocular. In fact, the two converging lenses of which
we speak are objectives of two telescopes placed at the two extremities of the
distance over which the light travels, and directed towards each other so that
the image formed by the objective of the one is seen at the focus of the other.
It is in the interior of the first telescope, between the focus and the oceular,
that is placed the transparent glass plate inclined 45 degrees, of which we
spoke above, to receive and to reflect along the axis of the telescope the light
of a lamp placed on the side. As to the mirror which sends back the light
to its point of departure, we place it exactly at the focus of the second tele-
scope. M. Fizcau, in his notice read before the Academy of Sciences, (meeting
of July 23, 1849,) says:

“This arrangement succeeds very well, even when the telescopes are separated by con-
siderable distances. With telescopes of 6 centimetres (234; inches) aperture, the distance can
be 8 kilometres (nearly 5 miles) without the light becoming too feeble. We thus see a
duminous point like a star, and formed by the light, which, setting out from this point, has
traversed a distance of 16 kilometres, (nearly 10 miles,) then returned and passed exactly
through the same point to reach the eye. °

“It is exactly at this point that the teeth of the revolving disk must pass to produce the

effects spoken of. ‘The experiment succeeds very well, and we observe that, according to the
greater or less velocity of rotation, the luminous point shines brilliantly or is totally eclipsed.

ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 155

In the circumstances in which the experiment was made, the first eclipse was produced in
about twelve turns and siz-tenths of a turn in one second. With double the velocity the star
shines again; with a triple velocity a second eclipse takes place: for a quadrupie velocity

the point shines again, and so on.
‘The first telescope was placed on the terrace of a house at Suresnes, near Paris; the

second on the heights of Montmartre, at an approximate distance of 8,633 metres, (28,516

feet, or 5.3645 miles.)
“The.disk, carrying 720 teeth, was attached to wheel-work moved by weights, and con-
structed by M. Froment; a register gave the number of revolutions. The light was obtained

from a lamp so disposed as to give a very bright beam.”

M. Fizeau, by repeating several times his experiment, found for the velocity
of light a value which differed but little from that previously deduced from
astronomical phenomena; the mean of twenty-eight observations gave him a
velocity of 70,948 leagues of 25 to the degree, or of about 315,000 kilometres
(195,741 miles) in one second of time.

The publication of this magnificent experiment was an event in science.
The project developed by Arago before the Academy, in 1838, had shown the
possibility of rendering appreciable the progressive transmission of light in
space»and demonstrated that it would have to run over but a very short dis-
tance on the earth’s surface to determine thus its velocity. The experiment
of M. Fizeau, formed on an entirely different plan, realized for the first time
so daring an idea, and furnished at the same time a determination of the ve-
locity of light, whose agreement with that which astronomers had arrived at
from sidereal observations was as satisfactory as one could desire for a first
attempt of the kind.*

REALIZATION OF THE EXPERIMENT OF ARAGO, ON ONE HAND BY M. FOUCAULT,
ON THE OTHER BY MM. FIZEAU AND BREGUET.

For nearly eleven years the proposed experiment of Arago had remained as
fo)

an ingenious suggestion when the labors of M. Fizeau awakened the interest

of the learned world in problems of this nature. Some months later (meeting
of April 29, 1850) Arago again requested for it the attention of the Academy.
After having referred to the object of the notice printed in the Comte Rendu,
of the meeting of December 3. 1838. he added:

‘*That communication established that, according to readily admitted hypotheses as to
the angular deviations susceptible of being observed in an ordinary telescope, it would not
be impossible to determine the comparative velocity of light in bisulphide of carbon and in
air, without having recourse to an extreme length of tube, or to a mirror, making more than
1,000 turns in a second.. But the mirror which M. Wheatstone used made only 800 turns in
the same interval of time.

“It was evident that in this method of observation, and for a given angular deviation, the
length of tube containing the liquid ought to be so much the shorter, as the movement of
rotation of the mirror is more rapid. This is the reason I propose to add to this deviating
motion of rotation, which cannot surpass certain limits, 2 cumbination of several revolving
mirrors.

‘“'The two rays (one having traversed the liquid, the other the air) strike the first mirror,
and form a certain angle; this angle is doubled when the rays fall upon a second mirror
turning in the same direction with the same velocity; the angle is tripled if these rays are
reflected from a third revolving mirror, and soon. We can thus, by the multiplication of
the revolving mirrors, arrive at the same result given by a single mirror turning with a
double, triple, &c., velocity of that which it is possible to obtain with the certainty of not
destroying the teeth of the wheel, or of overheating the axis,

‘* My triend, M. Bréguet, jr., undertook to accoiuplish this end by means of a mechanism,
in which the communication of motion was given by wheel-work. He executed a special
arrangement of cog-wheels, the invention of which is due to White. At one of the former
industrial exhibitions could be seen the system of these movements.

* Tt was for this experiment of Suresnes that the Institute of France awarded to M. Fizeau,
at its annual meeting of 1856, the triennial prize of thirty thousand francs, founded by the
Emperor for the work or the discovery which, in the opinion of the five academies of the Insti-
tute, has done most honor ard service to the country.
156 ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

‘Tn observing the image reflected by the mirror attached to the third piece of wheel-work,
the effects observed should be identical with those which should be given by a revolving
mirror making 3,000 turns per second. From this moment the success ef the projected
experiment was placed beyond doubt. It was only to be regretted that, by the three suc-
cessive reflections from three different mirrors, the light necessarily experienced a considera-
ble loss in intensity. Jt was, therefore, desirable to arrive at the result by a single reflection;
and it is to this that the expenments which I am going to relate seem to lead.

“Tn his investigations into the causes which prevented us revoiving a mirror more than
1,000 turns per second, M. Bréguet proposed to relieve the last axis of the weight of the
mirror with which it was charged, to turn the axis alone; and he succeeded, not without
surprise, in giving to this axis 8,000 turns per second. ‘The obstacle which prevented us
giving the same axis, when it carried the murror, a velocity greater than 1,0U0 tarns per

second appeared evident. It was, one would think, the resistance of the air. I myself.

thought of the existence of that cause, and all our though s were directed to the means of
revolving the mirror ina vacuum. We immediately constructed a metallic receiver destined
io hold the revolving apparatus. This receiver had several apertures, of which one was to
give entrance to the rays of light after having traversed the two columns of air and of liquid.
Before the others were to be the ebjectives of the telescopes, with which to observe the
rays reflected by the rotating mirror, the necessary communications were established by
means of stufling-boxes between the apparatus and the driving weight. A special tube put
the interior of the receiver in-communicaion with an air-pump.

‘All was arranged and placed upon a stone column in the meridian room of the observa-
tory. It only remained to make the observation. * 4 si et rs > * (The

the air. This circumstance again showed the truth of the proverb, ‘‘ Le mieux est ’ennemi
du bien:” (Better is the enemy of good enough.) It was necessary to think of return-
ing to the first apparatus composed of three pieces of wheel-work and of three separate
mirrors, the apparatus which Lt had given up only to obtain a greater intensity in the
reflected ray.

“‘T was convinced of: the necessity of going back to the first method of experiment at the
time when my enteebled sight would not allow me to undertake it. My pretensions, there-
fore, ought to be limited to having proposed the problem, and of having given the certain
means of solving it. These means may, during its accomplishment, experience modifica-
tions, which will render them applicable, with more or less facility, without changing their
essential character.”

After some details, which it is useless to give here, Arago adds :

‘*As to myself, if I have delayed a long time the realization of that which I had announced
that has been owing in large part to the obligations which M. Bréguet, my collaborator, had
contracted with the government for the supply of electric telegraphs, and to the desire that I
had to operate, as I have already said, with a mirror making 8,0U0 turns per second.

‘* Probably, also, I may remain content with the thought that no one will execute, with-
out my authorization, an experiment founded on principles and methods of execution which
J have exposed to the world in their most minute details.

**M. Bessel, after my publication in the Compie fendu, announced to me that he had
thought of a modification of my apparatus composed of three successive pieces of wheel-
work, each carrying a mirror. He receives the image reflected by the first rotating mirror
not upon a second revolving mirror, but upon a fixed mirror, which sends the ray back to
the first mirror. After this second reflection, the rays fall again upon a fixed mirror, from
which they are reflected a third time to the turning mirror, &c. It is after the last reflection
from the single revolving mirror that M. Bessel proposes to measure the angular departure
of the ray. This method, more simple than the one i proposed, in so far as it required only
one piece of wheel-work, had the very grave inconvenience of diminishing much more the
light, since he had more reflections from the mirrors than in the other method. * * *

*“M. Silbermann, without knowledge of the prior communication of M. Bessel, made me
a proposition similar to that of the illustrious observer of Koenigsberg.

« * ¥ * ‘a * * a * * # *

‘Things were in this state when M. Fizeau determined by his so ingenious experiment
the velocity of light in the atmosphere. Thet experiment was not indicated in my memoir.
‘The author, therefore, had the right to make it without exposing himself to the slightest
reproach for want of due consideration of the rights of others.

“As to the experiment on the comparative velocity of light in a liquid and in air, the
author wrote to me: ‘I have not yet made any attempt in that direction, and I will not
occupy myself with it but on your formal invitation, ‘his loyal reserve could only add to
the esteem with which the character and the works of M. Fizeau had inspired me, and I
willingly authorized M. Bréguet to lend him one or several of my rotating mirrors.

‘““M. Foucault, whose inventive genius is well known to the Academy, came also to
inform me of the desire he had to submit to the test of experiment a modification which he
had devised in my apparatus, ,

ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 157

‘I can only, in the present condition of my sight, accompany with my good wishes the
experimenters who desire to follow my ideas, and to add a new proof in favor of the wave
system to that which I have deduced from a phenomenon of interierence teo well known to
physicists to need recalling here.”

The communication of Arago, of which we have here given the principal parts,
was hardly printed in the Compte Rendu, of the meeting of April 29, 1850,
when the Academy received, at the following meeting, (May 6.) two important
communications on this subject, one of M. Foucault, the other of MM. Fizeau
and Bréguet. M. Foucault announced that he had realized with entire success
the beautiful experiment projected by Arago ;* he made known at the same
time the modifications he had given to the mode of arrangement indicated by
the illustrious perpetual secretary of the Academy, a modification which had
allowed him to arrive at this important result, which gave entire evidence of
the truth of the theory of undulation as opposed to that of emission. MM.
Fizeau and Bréguet had not progressed so far; they announced to the Academy
that their apparatus was adjusted and ready to work, and also showed in what
this apparatus differed from the original arrangement of Arago. Finally, a
few weeks later, June 17, they returned to announce to the Academy that
they likewise on their part had made this remarkable experiment; the result,
agreeing with that of M. Foucault, was in favor of the theory: of undulation.

Two important modifications had been made by M. Foucault in the arrange-
ment of Arago’s apparatus. ‘The first of these changes had for its object to
render the realization of the experiment incomparably easier. It is remem-
bered that, in the experiment of Arago, the light had to set out, so to say,
instantaneously from two luminous points, or rather from a luminous line
shining only during an excessively short time; that one beam of that light,
after having travelled in the air, and the other beam in a liquid, were to fall
upon a mirror endowed with an excessively rapid movement of rotation; that,
finally, after being reflected from this turning mirror, they should arrive at the
eye of the observer, furnished for that purpose with a good telescope. The
direction of the ray could very easily be determined in advance, since it was
that of a line going from the source of light to the mirror; but it is not the
same with the direction of the reflected rays which depend essentially upon
the position occupied by the mirror at the instant the reflection takes place, and
as the motion of the mirror and the reflection of the luminous rays from its
surface are independent of cach other, it is only by chance that the mirror
would be found in such and such a position; the observer, therefore, cannot
know in what direction he should place his telescope in order to receive the
luminous rays after their reflection. To obviate that difficulty Arago supposed
thatthe observer, being stationed anywhere in the space the reflected rays
could reach, and having directed his telescope towards the revolving mirror,
would successively repeat a great number of times the instantaneous emission
of light towards the rotating mirror, so that the rays from each of these emis-
sions being reflected from the mirror when in different positions, theré necessa-
rily would be some which would fall upon the objective of the telescope and
thus reach the eye of the observer. It was therefore a fugitive phonomenon
which the revolving mirror projected at each instant into the surrounding
space, sometimes in one direction, sometimes in another, and which by chance,
from time to time, would strike the telescope of the observer. It was to mul-
tiply the chances of observation of this fugitive phenomenon that Arago, at
the end of his communication of 1838, spoke of substituting for the single
mirror a vertical prism of eight or ten facets, and to employ at the same time
several observers placed in different positions, and each provided with a

*See, at the end of this essay, the article published by M. Foucault, in the Journal des
Débats, of May 4, 1850.
158 ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

telescope. Instead of that, M. Foucault modified the instrument so that the
reflected rays which should reach the eye of the observer quitted the revolving
mirror in one direction, determined beforehand, so that the observer could sta-
tion himself so as to receive conveniently all the reflected rays without leaving
anything to chance. To accomplish this the light from the luminous object
fell upon the revolving mirror, not in an intermittent manner, but continuously,
so that it was reflected in all directions around its axis; in one of these direc-
tions the reflected light met a fixed mirror on which it fell perpendicularly,
and which caused it to return over its path in sending it again to the rotating
mirror; there it experienced a new reflection which sent it to the luminous
object whence it set out. It was, therefore, near that object that the observer
placed his eye to receive the reflected rays, rays which, for convenience, M.
Foucault turned to one side by means of a transparent plate of glass inclined
45 degrees, similar to that which M. Fizeau had employed in his experiment
of Suresnes. The following are the words of M. Foucault in describing his
apparatus :

‘*A direct ray of light, penetrating a square opening, meets, very near the aperture, a reti-
cule of eleven vertical wires of platinum to the millimetre, (.03937 of an inch ; ) thence it
passes towards an excellent achromatic lens of long focus, placed at a distance from the
reticule less than double the principal focal distance. The image of the reticule of greater
or less dimensions would be formed on the other side, but, after having traversed the lens,
the pencil, before its convergence at the focus, falls upon the surface of the revolving mirror,
and, animated with an angular motion double that of the mirror, it forms in space an image
of the vertical wires, which is disp'aced with great rapidity. During a small portion of its
revolution this image meets the sutace of a concave mirror, whose centre of curvature coin-
cides with the centre of figure and the axis of rotation of the revolving mirror, and, during
all the time it passes over its surface, the light which has concurred to form it retraces its
path and falls upon the reticule itself, producing there its image, equal to it insize. In order
to observe this image without shuiting out the original beam, we place obliquely to the beam
of light, near the reticule, between it and the object glass, a glass plate, and we observe with
a powerful ocular the image thrown to one side. * * * The mirror, in revolving, causes
this image to reappear at each revolution, and, if the velocity of the motion of rotation is
uniform, it remains immovable in space. For velocities which do not surpass thirty turns
per second, its successive apparitions are more or less distinct, but over thirty turns give a
persistence to the impressions on the eye, and the image appears absolutely fixed.

‘*It is easy to demonstrate that the mirror, in revolving with greater or less rapidity, will
displace this image in the direction of the motion of rotation. In fact, the light which passes
between the wires of the reticule does not return to the wires until it has received from the
revolving mirror two reflections, separated by the time it takes to run over double the path
from the revolving mirror to the concave mirror. But, if he mirror revolves very fast, this
time taken by the liglit to go and come back, even over the small length of 4 metres, (13.12
feet, ) cannot be regarded as inappreciable, and the mirror has had the time to change sen-
sibly its position, which is shown by the change of position in the image formed by the re-
turning beam. Rigorously speaking, this effect takes place as soon as the mirror turns, even
slowly ; but it cannot be observed until the mirror has acquired a certain velocity, and only
when we employ certain precautions in the experiment. All my efforts have tended to render
this deviation as apparent as possible.

**The principal obstacle to surmount is that, in so complicated a path, the light cannot
converge to the focus in a neat, clear image. ‘The deadening which the pencil experiences,
in being reflected twice from a turning mirror of small surface, necessarily destroys the nicety
of the image, and produces in its contour an unavoidable mistiness. It is for this reason that
we have chosen for source of light the equi-distant linear spaces between the wires of a very
fine net. Although the image obtained is never clear, yet it is presented under the form of a
system of white and black stripes, similar to colorless diffraction bands, each having a well-
defined maximum and a minimum of light. Like the wires of the net, these luminous or
obscure spaces are distant from each other one-cleventh of a millimetre, (a millimetre equals
-03937 of an inch, ) and if, to observe them, we place in the occular a micrometer divided into.
tenths of a millimetre, the two systems ef lines will operate, by their relative displacements,
as a vernier, and will permit us to measure in the image, with certainty, a displacement of
the one hundredth of a millimetre. :

‘After the known velocity of light, with an objective of 2 metres (6.56 feet) focus, and in
using the double path of 4 metres, (13.12 feet,) we find that we need not give to the mirror
an extreme velocity (six or eight hundred revolutions per second) in order to obtain displace-
ments of two and three-tenths of a millimetre. Fé = - S * ~

‘Such is the construction of the optical apparatus which has permitted me to show the
successive propagation of luminous rays. My first attempts succeeded in the air with a
ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 159°

mirror which made only twenty-five to thirty turns per second, the length of the double path:
being four metres.

‘* In order to make the experiment with water, we have only to place between the revolving
mirror and the concave mirror a column of this liquid, held between two parallel plates of
giass in a conical metallic tube, varnished inside with copal, so that the water would remain.
clear, to take the necessary precautions that the terminal plates are not strained in their frames,
and to obviate the inconvenience of the change of focus by the interposition of a liquid layer
of 3 metres (9.84 feet) thickness, having paral.el surfaces. Jn the end we succeeded in easily
obtaining, with the feeble and green ray which has traversed the water, an image as distinct
as that which is formed withou: the interposition of the liquid. Therefore it is required but
to turn the mirror and to measure with precision its velocity of rotation if we desire to deduce:
the absolute velocities in air and in water, or to operate simultaneously on these two media
if we wish to know only the character and difference of these velocities.”

The second modification introduced by M. Foucault, in the arrangement of
the apparatus Arago proposed to employ, was in reference to the means of giving:
to the revolving mirror an extremely rapid movement of rotation and of keep-
ing up this motion a sufficient length of time. In the apparatus of Arago, M.
Bréguet produced this movement of rotation by means of wheels with oblique
teeth revolving under the action of a weight. M. Foucault substituted the
direct action of steam, evolved at a certain pressure from a steam-boiler, on a.
little turbine fitted to the axis carrying the mirror. The much greater simpli-
city of this rotating mechanism offered very notable advantages in the execution:
of the experiments.

In his communication to the Academy, M. Foucault thus announced the re-
sults he had already obtained :

‘In confining myself to the determinations of the velocity (of the mirror) by the sound,
(produced by the action of the steam on the little turbine, ) as I have already proved by two
successive observations that the deviation of the image after the passage of the light through
the uir is less than after its passage through the water, I have also made another confirmatory
experiment, which consists in observing the image formed in part by the light which has
traversed the air, and in part by the light which has traversed the water. During low
velocities the stripes of the compound image were sensibly the continuations of cach other,
and, by the acceleration of the movement of rotation, the image is carried to one side, and the
stripes are broken at the boundary line, at the junction of the air image with the water image,
the stripes of the latter being in advance in the direction of the common deviation. Moreover.
in taking into account the lengths of air and water traversed, the deviations were seen to be-
proportional to the indices of refraction. ‘These results demonstrate a velocity of light less in
water than in air, and fully confirm, according to the views of Arago, the indications of the
theory of undulations.”

M. Fizeau, on his part, made to the Academy of Sciences, in the same meet-
ing of the 6th of May, the point to which he and M. Bréguet had arrived in
their attempts to attain the same result. We reproduce here his communication
in full, taken from the Compte rendu of the meeting:

‘*We have undertaken to realize the important experiment of which M. Arago spoke to:
the Academy at its last meeting, and which he is not able to undertake at this moment on
account of the feeble condition of his sight.

“The rotary apparatus of M. Bréguet carries a small mirror of 12 millimetres (.472 of an
inch) in diameter, to which can be given a velocity of nearly 2,000 turns per second, and
which easily makes 1,200 or 1,500 revolutions.

‘**The optical arrangement that we employ is founded on the return of the rays on them-
selyes, produced by means of a perpendicular reflection: this is the arrangement which I
described in a preceding work.

‘*The light emanating from a luminous image, formed at the focus of the telescope,
traverses the objective, meets the revolving mirror, and is reflected normally trom a fixed.
mirror; then comes back to the revolving mirror, traverses the object glass, and returns
finally to the focus.

‘Tbe phenomenon produced by the rotation consists in the deviation of the return-image,
which is a permanent image resulting from the very rapid succession af instantaneous super-
posed images; the deviation results from the angular movement made by the revolving
mirror, whilst the light runs over double the distance which separates it from the fixed
mirror. After having observed the deviations in air for distances which were varied, so as
to obtain the greatest intensity of light and the best definition possible, we arranged the-
experiment so as to observe simultaneously the corresponding deviations of water and of air..
160 ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGUT.

For equal lengths of the two media the ratio of the two deviations should be, after one or the
other of the theories of light, either $ or 3. “s

“But, instead of taking equal lengths, we can take them so that they will be for the
water and for the air in the ratio of 4 to 3. According to the theory of emission, these
lengths are equivalent, or are run over in equal times, and the deviations should be equal.
According to the theory of undulations, on the contrary, these lengths should be run over in
very different times, which are for water and for air in the ratio of 16 to 9, and the deviations

should be in the same ratio - ;

“We have, therefore, adopted for water a length of 3 metres, (9 feet 10.11 inches, ) and
for air a length of 2.25 metres, (7 feet 4.53 inches. )

‘« The experiment made simultaneously on the two media becomes a very delicate differen-
tial experiment, in which it is not necessary to know exactly the velocity of rotation of the
mirror. We have only to compare the simultaneous deviations of the two images.

‘The apparatus is entirely constructed, but the condition of the atmosphere has not yet
allowed us to make the observation, and these experiments require so intense a light that it
is not possible to substitute for the sun’s rays artificial light. If the sky had been cloudless
yesterday or to-day, we would have been able to have presented to-day the result to the
Academy. If our experiments are not yet accomplished, it is because we waited until M.
Arago should authorize us to engage in researches which belong to him.”

Six weeks later, as we have already said, MM. Fizeau and Bréguet announced
to the Academy (meeting of 17th June, 1850) the complete success of their
experiment. ‘They obtained very neat results; the phenomena observed were
altogether in accord with the theory of undulation, and evidently opposed to
the theory of emission.

Thus the beautiful experiment of Arago was doubly realized. That which
had specially facilitated the success of this experiment, and given a great pre-
cision to the observation of the phenomena produced, was the modification of
the original arrangement as indicated by Arago, a modification which had for
its object to replace the fugitive image observed only by chance in a given
direction, by a permanent image produced in a determinate place, where we
can observe it with precision and at our ease. M. Foucault rightly attached a
great importance to that modification, and in the communication to the Academy,
the Gth May, 1850, he claimed its invention in these terms:

‘This memoir has also for its ebject to fix the date of a series of applications of the new
method, which consists essentially a the observation of the fixed image of a moving unage.”

But we may see in the communication of M. Fizeau, which we are about to
reproduce, that, in the apparatus which he had devised with M. Bréguet for
the execution of the experiment, the same modification is found introduced.
We there read in fact :

‘“'The optical arrangement ~* if ‘i ti iy *  -* is founded on the return
of the rays on themselnes, produced by means of a perpendicular reficction.”

And further on :

‘The phenomenon produced by the rotation consists in the deviation of the image in its
return, which is a@ permanent image resulting from the very rapid succession of instantaneous
superposed images.”

M. Fizeau even refers this modification to the arrangement he kad adopted in
his beautiful experiment of Suresnes, for in speaking of the return of the rays
on themselves, produced by means of a perpendicular reflection, he adds: “ This
is the arrangement which I have described in a preceding work.’* ‘The ecom-
munication of the notices of MM. Foucault and Fizeau, at the same academic
meeting, constitutes a simultaneous publication which does not allow the slightest
priority to be established between them on this subject; but M. Moucault took
care to assure that priority in publishing two days in advance, in a political
journal, the detailed description of his apparatus.* That which belongs essen-

tially to M. Foucault is the substitution of the steam turbine in place of the
wheel-work employed by M. Bréguet to rapidly turn the mirrow, and that modi-
fication has also a great importance on account of the facility it gives to vary
the velocity of the mirror, to regulate it, and to maintain it at a uniform velocity
during as long a time as we wish.

MEASURE OF THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT, BY M. FOUCAULT.

The apparatus which served M. Foucault to determine that light moves faster
in air than in water was not devised solely for that comparative experiment;
its principal object was to furnish the absolute value of the velocity of light.
It was in this point of view that M. Foucault brought it forward in 1850, in
indicating in a precise manner the means which he proposed to employ in order
to arrive at a certain precision in that measure.

We have seen that in this apparatus the return of the rays upon themselves
gives place to the formation of a permanent image which is displaced trans-
versely by a quantity so much the greater as the revolving mirror turns more
rapidly. The measure of this displacement of the image can make known the
quantity the mirror has turned during the interval of two successive reflections
of light from its surface in going and in returning—that is to say, while the light
had run over twice the distance of the revolving mirror from the fixed mirror;
it is therefore sufficient to know exactly the velocity of rotation of the mirror
in order to deduce the time elapsed between these two successive reflections—
that is to say, the time employed by the light to make double the journey from
the turning to the fixed mirror, and consequently the value of the velocity of
light.

"The following is the very ingenious method by which M. Foucault was
enavied to determine exactly this velocity of rotation, or rather so to adjust the
motion that the mirror can be made to turn with a velocity determined before-
hand.

A wheel-work mechanism gives a uniform movement of rotation to a disk,
toothed like a circular saw. ‘his disk makes exactly one turn in one second.
The teeth-which arm its contour, and which are accurately cut equidistant, are
to the number of 400; so that the time employed by one of these teeth to take
the place of the one which has preceded it is exactly the ;35th part of a second.
We so place the wheel that its border cuts the plane of the field of view of the
microscope with which we observe the return-image from the mirror. If this
field were continuously illuminated, the teeth of the disk would appear to pass
before the eye with the velocity of their motion; but itis not thus. The light
only comes to the field of the microscope at the instant a reflection takes place
from the revolving mirror ; this field, and consequently the border of the toothed
disk, are only illuminated by successive flashes of light, and those: flashes are
governed by the rotation of the mirror, which at each revolution sends rays
into the interior of the microscopes. If the mirror makes exactly 400 turns
per second, then the interval between two successive iluminations of the field
of the microscope is exactly equal to the time employed by each tooth to take
the place of that which preceded it; so that at the moment of the successive
illuntinations we always see a tooth of the disk in the same point of the field
of view: the disk appears absolutely immovable. Suppose now that the mir-
ror makes a little dess than 400 turns per second; whilst it makes a revolution,
each tooth of the disk goes a little further than it ought in order to take exactly
the place of the preceding tooth; at the moment of the successive illumina-
tions the teeth which replace cach other do not appear any longer exactly at
the same point in the field of view of the microscope; they appear little by little
in advance in the direction of the motion of the rotating disk, so that the disk
appears to have a slow movement of rotation in the direction of its real motion.

ll s
BGP? ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

If, on the contrary, the mirror makes alittle move than 400 turns per second, the
teeth of the disk at the moment they are illuminated appear more and more
behind a fixed position, and the disk seems to turn slowly in a direction the
reverse of its real motion. When we have so adjusted the velocity of rotation
of the mirror that the appearance of the border of the toothed disk which we
see in the field of microscopé appears immovable, we are certain that the mir-
ror makes exactly one turn while the circumference of the disk progresses one
division, and consequently whilst the mirror makes exactly 400 turns per second.
It was by adding this improvement or complement to his apparatus of 1850,
by substituting compressed air (evolved from the blowing-machine of constant
pressure of M. Cavaillé-Coll) for steam as the motive power of the little turbine
attached to the axis of the mirror, by increasing the length of the path of the
light between the two reflections from the revolving mirror from 4 to 20 metres
(from 13 feet 1.48 inches to 65 feet 7.4 inches) by means of successive reflec-
tions from intermediate fixed mirrors, by taking every possible precaution to
measure the displacement of a few tenths of a millimetre given by the revolving
mirror to the position of the image in its return, that M. Foucault, in September
1862, succeeded in determining with a certain precision the velocity of light in
air. He thus founda velocity of 298,000 kilometres (185,177 miles) per second,
a velocity a little below that of 308,000 kilometres, (191,391 miles,) which re-
sult from the value of aberration (20.45 seconds) deduced by M. Struve, from
very exact astronomical observations, combined with the value (8.57 seconds)
adopted up to this period for the parallax of the sun.

Let us recapitulate the series of labors which has led to so remarkable a
result :

Mr. Wheatstone (1834-’36) devised the use of a rapidly revolving mirror, to
render appreciable excessively small intervals of time.

Arago showed (1838) how, with the aid of such a revolving mirror, we would
be able to determine the difference of velocities with which light traverses air
and a liquid.

In the mean while M. Fizeau succeeded (1849) in being the first to render
evident the progressive transmission of light and to measure its velocity, by
means of an experiment made on the surface of the earth, in the space of a few
kilometres, and adopted an altogether different method from that proposed by
Arago.

An important modificatien, introduced (May, 1850) in the arrangement de-
vised by Arago, rendered incomparably easier the observation of the effect due
to the difference of velocity of light in air and in a liquid.

Owing to this modification the experiment of Arago was executed nearly at
the same time (May and June, 1850,) first by M. Foucault, and thea by MM.
FPizeau and Bréguet.

Finally, M. Foucault, perfecting his apparatus, measured (in 1862) the velocity
of light in operating entirely in the interior of a laboratory of moderate dimen-
sions.

An admirable experiment in physics, in which, by the power of intellect and
manual skill, we have succeeded not only in rendering sensible, but even
measurable, the time employed by light to rua overa path of 20 metres, (65 feet
7.4 inches ) although this time barely equals the psga/ogqgth of a second! and
which, if we repeat it so as to vary its elements, and thus make evident the
constant causes of error wh.ch affect the result, appears capable of giving a
determination of the velocity of light altogether as precise as that which is de-
duced from astronomical phenomena!

We would be unjust if we did not mention that the success of the experi-
ment of M. Foucault was greatly indebted to M. Froment, the able constructor
of the different parts of the apparatus. The clock-work which gave to the

ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 163

toothed disk a uniform motion of one revolution per second, and the revolving
mirror put in motion by the little air-turbine, or siréne, ought to take rank
among the numerous mechanical wonders which have proceeded from his hands.
The most ingenious conceptions remain unrealized if they do not find an artist
capable of execufing them. Thus history has taken the care to treasure the
memory of eminent mechanicians, to whom are due the delicate constructions
which have given important progress to science. ‘The name of the illustrious
Inglish clock-maker, Graham, remains forever associated with the discovery of
aberration and of nutation, made by Bradley, with an instrument constructed
by that artist; in the same manner the name of M. Froment will remain in-
separable from the beautiful and refined experiment of which we have just
spoken, and for which he executed the important and ingenious improvements
added by M. Foucault to the original apparatus devised by Arago.

Thus science is in possession of two methods, essentially different from each
other, to effect the measure of the velocity of light on the surface of the earth.

The first of these two methods, invented by M. Fizeau, was employed by
him in his memorable experiment of Suresnes; but although the number that
he thus obtained was very satisfactory from its close agreement with that
which is deduced from astronomical observations, still we should only regard
this experiment as having established the possibility of measwaing the velocity
of light by employing this method. As soon as the success of this method
was made known the Academy of Sciences, on the proposition of a commission
of which Arago was a member, determined to construct at its expense an appa-
ratus of large dimensions to turn the toothed disk destined to measure the
velocity of light by the method of M. Fizeau, in using every possible precau-
tion to give to that measure all the precision of which it was susceptible. The
apparatus ordered of M. Froment was finished, but its adjustment on the ter-
race of the Observatory was prevented; all the details of the observation to
be made between this terrace and a distant station, such as Mont-Valérien or
the tour of Montlhéry, had been studied; it was determined to employ tele-
scopes of large aperture, in order to increase the luminous intensity of the
observed image, and thus give all the desirable distinctness to the successive
eclipses occasioned by the increasing velocity of the disk; it was proposed
thus to produce twelve or more successive eclipses, &c., when the death of
Arago postponed the execution of this important operation. Let us hope that
the postponement will not be indefinite, and that the realization of an experi-
ment which promises such chances of great success will not be delayed.

The second method is that of M. Foucault, who has also obtained by its
means a value for the velocity of light which is not far removed from that
given by astronomical observation, and agreeing even still closer with it if we
adopt the increase which it seems we should give to the value of the parallax
of the sun. ‘This method, much more delicate than that of M. Fizeau, ap-
pears, on account of its very refinement, more exposed than the latter to the
influence of constant causes of error capable of falsifying the result. Let us
also hope that M. Foucault will not delay to complete his labors, by studying
the influence of these causes of error, so as to deduce a value for the velocity
of light the most precise that this method can furnish. The simultaneous use
of these two methods of measurement, whose results mutually control each
other, is not too much in order to determine with all the exactitude possible
the value of an element so important’as that of the velocity of the propagation
of light through space.

ARTICLE PUBLISHED BY M. FOUCAULT, IN THE ‘‘ JOURNAL DES DEBATS,”
ON THE REALIZATION OF THE EXPERIMENT OF ARAGO.

[Number of Tuesday, April 30, 1850. ]

To THE Eprror—Sir: I will not wait for the expiration of the fortnight
to give you an account of what most occupied the Academy of Sciences during
their meeting of yesterday. All knew that M. Arago was to continue the
account of his beautiful researches of polarization and of photometry. The
attendance was large, and the Academy recorded at its session a foreign asso-
ciate and two corresponding members—Mr. David Brewster, Lord Brougham,
and M. de la Rive, of Geneva. But what was not expected was, that M. Arago
recalled attention to one of the most beautiful projected experiments that the
genius of a savant has ever produced, and he declared that, after having con-
ceived it, he had left to the young generation the care and the honor of per-
forming it. ‘T'his experiment has more than once occupied the attention of the
Academy; it proposes to decide, by means of a revolving mirror, whether
light moves faster in air than in water, and to seek, in the probable result of
this experiment, the confirmation of the theory at present adopted to explain
all optical phenomena. You may judge, sir, of the emotion with which I
heard this generous declaration; I, who for several days had in my hands the
experimental solution of this great problem! Nevertheless I thought it proper
to postpone to the next meeting the reading of the paper in which I have
recorded my results. In the mean time permit me, sir, to announce, in a few
words, the results which I have observed.

Light employs more time to run over the same path in water than in air, and
the time which it takes to traverse these two different media is shown by the
deviation of the ray which is reflected at a given moment from a mirror re-
volving with a great velocity. All things remaining equal, the deviations were
found to be proportional to the indices of refraction of air and of water. It is
not possible to entertain the least doubt as to the reality of these results; they
have been obtained by two different methods. The two deviations were first
observed successively and found unequal for the same velocity of the mirror.
They were then observed simultaneously, which cendered the observation still
more certain. ;

Permit me to limit myself to the rather technical expression of these new
results. When the columns of the Journal are unoccupied I shall enter into
such developments as will render these propositions more intelligible to your
readers.

Receive, sir, &e., &e.

LEON FOUCAULT.

[Number of Saturday, May 4, 1850.]

We published last Tuesday a letter of M. Foucault announcing the success
of an optical experiment originally devised by M. Arago, and which, in giving
the relative velocities of light in air and in water, accomplished the overthrow
of the emission theory in favor of the theory of undulation. The sun haying
appeared during the few days past, they have been able to repeat several times
the experiment in presence of a certain number of French and foreign savants,
and already the methods which have insured success are generally known to
the public. In waiting for the communication which will be given at the
meeting of the Academy next Monday, we will concisely indicate the funda-
mental parts of the experiment. ,

A beam of sunlight reflected from a heliostat in a fixed direction penctrates
horizontally a dark room; it first passes through a small opening of 2 milli-
metres (.0797 of an inch) square, then a,reticule extended behind this opening,
ESSAY ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 165

and formed of eleven platinum to the millimetre. Passing through this reticule,
the beam of light meets an objective of a focus of two metres placed at a dis-
tance from the reticule less than the double of its principal focal length, and it
tends to form beyond a magnified image of the reticule. But before the forma-
tion of this image the converging pencil is reflected from a small mirror which,
capable of rapidly revolving around a vertical axis, we will call the revolving
mirror. After its reflection, the converging beam will form an image before the
mirror at a distance of 4 metres, and when the mirror turns, this image moves
in space, describing circles double of the number of the turns of the mirror
supposed to-reflect from its two faces. In sweeping through space this image
meets a concave mirror whose centre of curvature corresponds with the centre
of figure of the revolving mirror and with the centre of the axis of rotation;
it thence results that during all the time that the image of the reticule falls on
the concave mirror the light is thrown back to its point of departure by the
revolving mirror and returns to form at the reticule its image of natural size.
This image coincides exactly with the reticule, when the revolving mirror being
at rest is placed at the proper angle of incidence; but as soon as it moves, the
image is deviated and deflected in the direction of the motion. In order conve-
niently to observe this deviation we place obliquely to the path of the entering
beam a glass plate which throws this image to one side. ‘This image appears like
colorless diffraction bands, striped with vertical lines, distant from each other
the eleventh of a millimetre; they are examined with a powerful ocular,
having at its focus a micrometer divided into tenths of a millimetre. ‘The
stripes of the image bear the relation to the divisions of the micrometer as a
scale to its vernier, so that deviations to the one-hundredth of a millimetre can
be read off. Calculation shows that a deviation should be observed for thirty
turns of the mirror in a second; and in fact it is seen for that velocity ; for
_greater velocities the deviation is measurable. If we wish to measure the
velocity of light in water we place between the revolving mirror and the con-
cave mirror a tube three metres long, filled with perfectly clear water, and its
ends closed by plates of glass of parallel surfaces. All things remaining the
same, the deviation observed when we interpose the tube of water is always
. greater than when this tube is not placed between the revolving and the con-
eave mirror. But it is better, to operate simultaneously in the air and in the
_ water, to employ two concave mirrors of the same radius of curvature and both
facing the revolving mirror; one destined to receive and send the rays through
the water, and the other through the air only. The mirror in revolving causes
the two images, corresponding to the two reflections, alternately to appear, but
the rapid succession of their apparitions makes them appear superposed ; to
distinguish them from each other we cover a good part of the height of the
concave mirror which reflects the image through the air, which reduces the light
of the brighter image; the remainder of the field is occupied by the image
which has traversed the water. The vertical stripes of these two images should
_ correspond, and indeed do correspond, for low velocities of the revolving mirror.
~ But as the velocity of rotation increases, the two rays are deflected unequally,
the stripes break at the line of junction, and the deviation is greater for the
' dull and green image which has traversed the water than for the luminous and
~ white image which has progressed only through the air. This last experiment,
although difficult to repeat with apparatus improvised in a hurry, has the ad-
“vantage to appeal directly to the eyes; it has been repeated before several dis-
“tinguished savants, who, in reference to it, no longer retain the least doubt.
‘lo give to the mirrors rapid and constant velocities M. Foucault uses a
“small steam-turbine, which was constructed with the greatest care by M. Iro-
_ ment. We cannot at present enter into the details of its construction. It wil)
_ be noticed hereafter, as well as the applications of this new method of expevri-
menting. when the paper in which it is described has been presented to the
Academy of Sciences.
OZONE AND ANTOZONE.

BY CHARLES M. WETHERILL, PH. D., M. D.

ScHOFNBEIN, in the year 1840, called attention to the existence of a substance
which he named from one of its most striking characteristics, ozone, (ofw, I
smell.) he peculiar odor in the neighborhood of a good electrical machine
when in action, and especially when the electricity issues from a point upon
the prime conductor, or is drawn from it as a spark, had been well known.
A similar odor had also been perceived accompanying thé fall of the thunderbolt.*
This phenomenon had been characterized as a phosphoric or a sulphur smell.

Schoenbein called attention to the fact that a similar smell is perceived during
the decomposition of water by the voltaic pile, and is observed accompanying
the oxygen which appears at the positive pole when the gases are collected
separately, and that it is also experienced in many chemical processes, espe-
cially in those involving a slow combustion. In explaining the odor of the
active electrical machine, it had been assumed that the sensation is due solely
to a peculiar action of the electricity upon the organs of smell, and not to the
presence of a material substance; but Schoeubein discovered, in the cases
alluded to, the existence of & body having the chemical properties of active
oxygen—that is, of this gas in its condition of entering most readily into chemi-
eal combination, to which he attributed the phenomenon in question, and to
which he assigned a characteristic name.

During.the twenty-five years which have elapsed since Schoenbein’s dis-
covery, this difficult subject has been investigated by many scientists, and
especially by Schoenbein himself, by Marignac, De la Rive, Fremy, Erdmann,
Berzelius, Williamson, Becquerel, Baumert, and others equally well known in
research. While there are few subjects which present a wider field for investi-
gation, or which are more important in their relations to a knowledge of animal
Jife, and to some interesting practical questions in technology, there are few which
require a greater patience, or a greater degree of skill in manipulation for their
research. It is in consequence of these difficulties that our knowledge of
ozone is so limited, notwithstanding the time and labor which have been be-
stowed upon it. It is the object of the present article to give a bricf sketch
of what is known respecting this substance, on the authority of the article ozone
in Poggendorff’s Dictionary, and from the essays of experimentors in various
scientitic periodicals.

Some time elapsed after its discovery before very definite views were held
as to the true nature of ozone. Schoenbein, who for a long time denied
that ozone is an allotropic form of oxygen, at first supposed that it was
a new body which, in union with oxygen, or perhaps with hydrogen, con-
stituted nitrogen, to which he attributed a compound character. De la Rive
imagined that the peculiar smell was due to the action upon the organ, of

* Homer notices the smell of the thunderbolt. Mohrin Pogs. Ann., xci, 625. Thus, in
the Odyssey, book xii, verse 417, and xiv, 307, Jupiter strikes a ship with a thunderbolt,
ev de Seevov TANTO, ‘* quite full of sulphurous odor”’ In the Iliad, viii, 135, Jove hurls a
bolt, ‘‘ with the flame of the burning sulphur,” into the ground before Diomede’s chariot.
In the same poem, xiv, 415, Ajax huris a rock at Heetor, who falls ‘‘jike a mountain oak
struck by lightning, which lies uprooted, and from which the fearful smell (odu7) of smoking
sulphur rises.”

OZONE AND ANTOZONE. 167

very finely divided metallic dust of platinum, or of gold, which was separated
from the conductors by the electric current, and converted into oxides of the
metals ; but Schoenbein proved this explanation to be untenable by the experi-
ment of employing hot points for the issuing of the electric charge into the air.
Under such circumstances the hypothetical separation of metallic particles and
their oxidation should be increased; but, upon the contrary, there was no
smell of ozone at all perceptible. Besides this, ozonized air, when shaken in
a bottle with water, does not lose its peculiar smell. Hence it is a gas, not
absorbable by water, but altered in its character by heat. Marignaec and De
la Rive subsequently performed experiments which seemed to show that ozone
is pure oxygen. As Marignac was unable to obtain ozone by electricity with
oxygen unless moisture was present, it was possible that the substance might
be peroxide of hydrogen, and this hypothesis became highly probable by the
extended and careful research upon this point by Dr. Williamson. This chem-
ist prepared ozone by the electrolysis of sulphate of copper, dried it by passage
over chloride of calcium, and passed it through a tube containing copper turn-
ings, heated to redness, which had been first oxidized and then reduced in a
current of carbonic oxide. By the experiment, oxide of copper and water
resulted. Schoenbein now adopted this hypothesis, having been fortified
by experiments of his own. At first he regarded ozone as a higher oxide
(HO;) than Thenard’s peroxide (HO2) of hydrogen; but at last retained the
latter formula. Schoenbein defended this view pertinaciously, supporting it
by experiments and by arguments against that of De la Rive, Marignac, Mar-
chand, Erdmann, Berzelius, Fremy, and Becquerel, who prepared ozone with
pure oxygen, (obtained from chlorate of potassa, the gas being washed and per-
fectly dried,) either by the electrical machine or by an induction current. Ma-
rignac, by acting with ozone upon pure powder of metallic silver, obtained
nothing but the peroxide of that metal. Hence the conclusion was warranted
that ozone is oxygen in an allotropic form. Schoenbein’s opinion was based
upon his view of the halogen bodies, which, like Berthollet, he believed to be
peroxides of unknown radicals, and from the analogy of ozone, in its chemical
behavior, to chlorine. He also assumed that no element is known which has
an action upon the olfactory nerves to call forth the sensation of smell; chlo-
rine, iodine, and bromine being, as he believes, compounds, while phosphorus
and arsenie act upon this sense by reason of their passage into the condition
of oxides.

Baumert contended that the odorous gas evolved by electrolytic action is
essentially different from ozone obtained by the electric spark. Its constitution,
according to this chemist, is HO3; it yields no water to anhydrous phosphoric acid
until it has first passed through a tube heated to redness, which he supposed
decomposes the HO;. Baumert, however, in subsequent experiments, acceded
to the opinion (derived from iheir investigations) of De la Rive, Erdmann,
Marignac, Marchand, Fremy, and Becquerel, that ozone is an allotropic condi-
tion of oxygen.

Schenbein, in 1858, discovered that if to diluted peroxide of hydrogen a
few drops of solution of acetate of lead be added, or that if ozonized oil of tur-
pentine be shaken with the same lead salt, peroxide of lead is formed. ‘The
same reaction takes place when ozonized oxygen acts upon basic acetate of lead.
When the peroxide of lead thus formed remains in contact with the peroxide

-of hydrogen, both are reduced; the result being water, protoxide of lead, and
oxygen. From this reaction, Schoenbein assumed that the oxygen in the perox-
ides of hydrogen and of lead exists in an opposite condition of polarity, thus:

+ —~
HOO and PbOO, and that by the union of these molecules of oxygen the ordi-
nary inactive oxygen results. Clausius and De la Rive also imagined a simi-
lar molecular condition for oxygen.
168 OZONE AND ANTOZONE.

Schoenbein designated those bodies containing negatively active oxygen,
(orO ), ozonides ; such are permanganic (Mn, 0, Os) and chromic acids (Cr2 03 Os),
and the peroxides of manganese, (Mn 0,0), silver, (Ag 0,0), and lead, (BR 0,0). )
He named antozonides ; peroxides of hydrogen, (HOO), barium, (Ba OO), and

+
all bodies which contain oxygen in a positively active condition, (O), and this
form of oxygen he called antozone.

+ i
This chemist succeeded in obtaining antozone (O) by projecting finely pow- .

ok

dered peroxide of barium (Ba OQ) into cold monohydrated sulphuric acid. A
gas is evolved which both Houzeau and Schoenbein formerly supposed to be
ozone, but which has different properties. It blues iodide of potassium starch
paper, and smells somewhat like ozone; but when agitated with a little water
it loses its odor completely, and forms peroxide of hydrogen, which reaction
ozone does not produce. <A slip of filter-paper saturated with a mixture of
dilute solution of ferricyanide of potassium and a persalt of iron is speedily
turned blue in antozone gas, but in ozone behaves as in atmospheric air. A
very small portion of the gas evolved by this reaction in antozone. ‘This is
due to the elevation of temperature, which transforms the antozone into ordi-
nary oxygen.

Another means of distinguishing ozone from antozone consists in a slip of
paper imbued with solution of sulphate of protoxide of manganese, which
speedily becomes brown in ozone, from the formation of peroxide of manga-
nese. In antozone, not only does this reaction not take place, but papers
browned by ozone are bleached by antozone.

A distinguishing test may also be found in the behavior of the two gases
with permaganie acid, which antozone decolorizes and ozone browns.

Dr. G. Meissner discovered that, if well dried electrified air be passed through
water, (which may or may not contain air,) it forms, upon issuing into the at-
mosphere, a more or less dense cloud or mist. ‘The same phenomenon takes place
when electrified air issues into a moist atmosphere.

This cloud is formed by the electrifying’ of either pure oxygen or of air; but
not by pure hydrogen, or nitrogen. It occurs, whether the gas contains ozone
or not, but in the latter case to a less degree.

By contact with drying substances, as concentrated sulphuric acid, chloride
of calcium, and even concentrated solutions of certain salts, the mist may be
caused to disappear; but it forms again by the addition of aqueous vapor.
The air left to itself gradually loses this mist-producing property, and if the
antozone cloud be confined, the water is, after a while, precipitated upon the
sides of the vessel, and can no more be produced by the action of vapor, unless
the air be electrified again.

Ozoniferous moist air retains its cloud-compelling property longer than that _
which does not contain ozone; and, on the-other hand, dry ozonized air pre-
serves this property still longer. Meissner satisfied himself, by numerous ex-
periments, that this phenomenon of mist is due to antozone, and that electrified
air contains both ozone and antozone, the former element being absorbed, and
the latter not absorbable by iodide of potassium, or pyrogallic acid. He dis-
covered, also, that antozone prepared by electricity is identical with that obtained
by the decomposition of peroxide of barium, as the former, when brought fresh
and dry in contact with water, generates a proportion of peroxide of hydrogen.
Meissner regards peroxide of hydrogen as a chemical compound of antozone
and water; but cloud or mist as a physical aggregate of antozone and vapor
of water, in which the chemical affinity of the two bodies is very much weak-
ened. Von Babo supposes the antozone cloud to be in most cases peroxide of

OZONE AND ANTOZONE. 169

hydrogen, and that it may be formed by the action of ozone also; its disap-
pearance he explains by the gradual precipitation, or decomposition of the
peroxide.

Meissner regards the formation of ozone and antozone possible simultane-
ously by the action of either positive or negative electricity upon ordinary
exygen; but Von Babo believes that only ozone is formed by the current. The
latter chemist found that ozonized air experienced no diminution of ozone upon
its passage through a solution of permanganic acid, but that this took place
immediately if the air came first in contact with substances capable of forming
peroxide of hydrogen; also, that ozonized oxygen, free from nitrogen, gen-
erated with water neither cloud nor peroxide of hydrogen.

According to Meissner, antozone is formed by all processes of oxidation and
combustion in oxygen; and, since the ozone enters chiefly, during combustion,
into the oxide thus generated, that the result is principally antozone (or peroxide
of hydrogen) in the free state. Antozone is, therefore, according to Meissner,
the cause of the cloud in tobacco smoke, the smoke of chimneys, of gunpowder,
fogs, and aerial clouds. Meissner found that the fumes of phosphorus in the
air are antozone clouds, and not nitrate of ammonia, the greater portion of the

zone generated by the reaction being absorbed by the phosphorus.

Meissner discovered that air saturated with moisture gives a cloud, upon sud-
den rarefaction, until the barometric pressure is reduced to eight inches. "This
corresponds to an elevation of 27,000 feet. By the observations of Kamtz, the
average altitude of the lightest and highest clouds, the cirrhi, is 20,000 feet,
and their greatest height 24,000 feet.

According to Meissner, water condensed from air or oxygen has the form of
vesicles, while, when it is separated from other gases, the moisture condenses
in the form of rain or solid drops.

A most curious occurrence of antozone presents itself in the fluor spar of
Wolsendorf, in Bavaria. This mineral has a peculiar smell, due to antozone,
which Schoenbein found in the proportion of =945 of the weight of the spar,
because five grammes, when rubbed with water, yielded 2.125 milligrammes of
peroxide of hydrogen. Since antozone is contained in powder-smoke, it may
be surmised that the copious rains which follow great battles are due, in a mca-
sure, to this body, the decomposition of the cloud of antozone-water being either
a cause or an effect of the electrical excitement in the atmosphere.

Having prepared antozone from an antozonide, Schoenbein sought to obtain
ozone from an ozonide, and selected permanganate of potassa for that purpose.
Bertazzi had already (Cimento ii, 291) shown that by the action of dilute
sulphuric acid, at a low temperature, upon this salt, a gas was generated which
had the properties of ozone. Schoenbein, upon a further investigation of the
subject, found that peroxide of barium projected into the olive-green solution of
permanganate of potassa, and oil of vitriol, of 1.85 specific gravity, evolves a gas
which has the smell and chemical properties of ozone. It acts strongly upon
the mucous membrane, polarizes platinum negatively with great power, and
destroys organic coloring matter and pyrogallic acid at the ordinary temperature.
R. Boettger, in calling attention to this experiment, states that he had two
years previously described the effect of oil of vitriol and permanganate of po-
tassa in producing a long-continued evolution of ozone. He considers the addi-
tion of peroxide of barium superfluous, and, for the development of ozone,
adds two parts of dry powdered permanganate of potassa to three of hydrate
of sulphuric acid in a bottle. By this reaction a strong ozone smell is at once
perceived, and all of the characters of the gas may be established by the proper
reagents.

Schoenbein has determined that antozone has a density less than hydrogen,
and that it liouefies at a pressure of 150 atmospheres. Ozone and antozone,
170 OZONE AND ANTOZONE.

exposed to the dark rays of the spectrum, unite, with explosion, and yield
ordinary oxygen.

Schoenbein considers that oxygen undergoes chemical polarization in the
body when respired, and accounts thus for the rapid changes which take place
in the tissues. He has found peroxide of hydrogen in the urine, and has dis-
covered that the blood corpuscules instantly decompose this compound. Ie
has given the following test for the peroxide of hydrogen. ‘To water, supposed
to contain the peroxide, he adds one or two drops of a solution of a salt of
bismuth, nickel, cobalt, thallium, &c., and then just enough of potassa to pre-
cipitate the hydrated oxide of the metal. He then adds a little iodide of po-
tassium and starch, and lastly one or two drops of acetic or dilute sulphuric
acid. If the merest trace of peroxide of hydrogen be present, the liquid is
instantly colored blue.

The following is Schoenbein’s method of determining quantitatively the de-
composition of oxygen into ozone and antozone. During the slow oxidation
of metals, according to this chemist, the oxygen is chemically polarized; one
of its atoms (ozone) unites with the metal or oxidizable matter, while the other
atom (antozone) combines with water to form peroxide of hydrogen. Schoen-
bein agitates an amalgam containing five per cent. of lead, with very dilute
sulphuric acid of known strength, in a large bottle partially filled with air or
oxygen. After a few moments of agitation, a quantity of sulphate of lead is
produced, and peroxide of hydrogen is found in the acidulated water. He
ascertains the oxygen which has combined with the lead, by determining the
amount of uncombined acid, thus calculating the sulphate of lead formed, and
consequently its oxygen. He determines the peroxide of hydrogen in another
portion of the water by a standard solution of permanganate of potassa, and
finds the quantity of oxygen in this peroxide to be very nearly the same as
that contained in the oxide of lead. ,

Different chemists have determined the diminution of volume experienced by
air or oxygen during ozonization.

Andrews and Tait placed pure dry oxygen ina tube and discharged elec-
tricity through the gas. With still discharges a diminution took place, which
was at first rapid and then slow until a maximum was reached, yielding a
diminution equal to 4, of the original volume. When, now, a few sparks were
passed through the gas it expauded 3 of the former diminution, but did not
attain its original volume. With rapid or spark discharges, oxygen experiences
a, diminution of volume, although less than by still discharges. Oxygen, con-
tracted by the formation of ozone, when left to itself at the ordinary tempera-
ture, expands again gradually. At 100° Centigrade it expands more rapidly,
and at 270° it regains its original volume and loses all of the characteristics of
ozone. At this temperature, therefore, ozone is destroyed. Andrews and
Tait found that, by still discharges, oxygen cannot lose more than +5 of its
volume, unless the ozone be removed as fast as it is generated, in which case
the diminution may proceed indefinitely. ‘They determined 60 for the density
of ozone compared with oxygen, which makes it six times lighter than lithium.
They were unable to condense it to a liquid at ordinary pressures by a freezing
mixture of solid carbonie acid and ether. ,

Ozone may be prepared for examination most readily by dropping, in small
quantities, dry permanganate of potassa in a bottle containing a little oil of
vitriol, or by placing a stick of phosphorus, scraped clean under Water, in
the bottom of a capacious vessel containing enough lukewarm water to half
submerge the phosphorus. In either of these cases a slip of iodide of potas-
sium starch-paper becomes instantly blue when immersed in the air of the ves-
sel, and the different ozone reactions may be readily perceived by employing
the appropriate tests. ‘The gas may also be investigated with the above starch-
paper in the neighborhood of a point upon the prime conductor of an elee-

OZONE AND ANTOZONE. 171

trical machine, from which still discharges are issuing. It may be obtained by
the inductive current of the Ruhmkorff coil, or by the electrolysis of water,
using a powerful Bunsen or Grove battery, and employing gold or platina for
the positive electrode, from which proceeds a current of oxygen, laden with
ozone. The hydrogen gas, issuing from the negative electrode, possesses no
odor of ozone, but this smell is perceived when the two gases are collected
together. The antozone, formed here by the polarization of the oxygen, unites
with the water to peroxide of hydrogen. If the water thus electrolized con-
tain substances capable of union with oxygen, as hydrochloric, hydriodic acids,
and their salts, also sulphurous acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, coal, iron filings,
&ec., or if the liquid or electrodes be heated, no ozone smell is perceived.

There is no process for obtaining pure and isolated ozone, although a con-
stant current of air laden with this gas may be procured for a certain time by
the action of sulphuric acid upon permanganate of potassa, or by passing
moist air through a tube containing pure phosphorus, and washing the gas with
water. The generation of ozone by the electric discharge is so slow that Bau-
mert, by passing 500,000 sparks in an hour, obtained only enough of this gas
to liberate one milligramme of iodine from its potassium salt.

Circumstances influence the production of ozone by the electrical discharge.
Under the same conditions, sparks of 25 millimetres in length generate twice
as much ozone as sparks of 4 to 5 sa en long.

Employing poenencly sealed tubes of 5 : millimetres diameter and 70 mil-
limetres long, 2 of the oxygen can be ee into ozone; but by continuing
the discharges the ozone diminishes, so that in 24 hours it equals only 4 of the
original oxygen.

By the electrolysis of water, containing 7g of sulphuric acid, Baumert ob-
tained only one milligramme of ozone in 150 litres of the mixed gases; but
when the water contained chromic acid instead of sulphuric, he found the same
quantity of ozone in 10 litres of the mixed gases.

Ozone is generated by means of phosphorus only in a moist air, containing
oxygen ata medium temperature. When the atmosphere is deprived gradually
of its oxygen, by means of ignited oxide of copper, the production of ozone
diminishes, and ceases entirely when there is no longer any, oxygen present.

Ozone is not formed in pure carbonic acid or hydrogen gases. With
volume of oxygen and 4 of carbonic acid, the formation of ozone is easy. In
an explosive mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, the generation of ozone is pow-
erful; the phosphorus shines vividly, and can acquire heat sufficient to kindle
and explode the mixture of gases. In pure oxygen, at the ordinary pressure
of the atmosphere, phosphorus, by the presence of water, does not produce
ozone until the temperature is raised from 75.2° to 86° Fahrenheit. At this
temperature the phosphorus begins to emit light, and the illumination and
ozone generation are powerful at 96.8° Fahrenheit.

Oxygen expanded to four times its volume, by the air-pump, yields ozone, by
phosphorus, at the ordinary temperature; but at 32° Fahrenheit there is no
production of ozone. In dry air phosphorus generates ozone slowly, as the
phosphorus soon becomes coated, which prevents the action of the air. There
is a connexion between the shining of phosphorus and its generation of ozone,
so that this production exists iu proportion to the intensity of the illumination;
but we are ignoraut of the cause of this connexion.

If we well wash air ozonized by phosphorus and place in it a piece of car-
bonate of ammonia, so that the gas reacts alkaline, and wash the gas again, it
still vives all of the characteristic reactions of ozone.

According to Schoenbein’s experiments, 1,000 grammes of phosphorus are
capable of converting 1,720 of oxygen into ozoue. By another trial he gives
0.43 gramme as the yield of ozone by 1 gramme of phosphorus. By hanging

ts)
silver leaf in a vitriol carboy filled with ozonized air, he could deozonize the
EG. OZONE AND ANTOZONE.

same in four hours; and, by repeating the process for several weeks, he was
able to prepare as much as 20 grammes of the peroxide of silver. Ozone
results also from the slow oxidation of pure ether, effected by the means of a
platinum spiral heated to redness and placed in the vapor of the ether. Accord-
ing to Schoenbein the combustion of hydrogen, carbide of hydrogen, and of
kindred gases, produces ozone.

The odor of ozone is so powerful that air containing only one millionth of it
has a decided smell of the gas. Ozonized air raised to the temperature of
482° to 572° Fahrenheit, is deprived instantly of this body.

A very characteristic action of ozone consists in its polarizing effects upon
the metals, particularly upon platinum, gold, and, to a less extent, edpper. An
ozoniferous atmosphere behaves like one containing chlorine or bromine. If a
slip of gold or platinum is immersed in an ozone atmosphere, it acquires a mega-
tive polarity in a few seconds. When sucha slip is united with an ordinary
one and the pair is plunged in acidulated water, a current is generated which
acts powerfully upon the needle of the galvanometer. Antozone, also, polaxizes

platinum negatively, but less so than ozone.
Inthe preparation of ozone by phosphorus, an odor characterized as “ garlic”
is first perceived. Gold or platinum, immersed in such air, is polarized post-
tively, and this condition may remain for a considerable time if the tempera-
ture be low. Presently, with a temperature of 53.6° to 60.8° Fahrenheit, the
gas exchanges its “ garlic” for an ozone smell; and, at the same time, the metal,
after quickly passing Volta’s point of indifference, acquires a negative polarity.
The least moisture deposited upon the metal, also an elevated temperature, pre-
vent, or, if present, destroy this polarization. It is also lost in the air gradu-
ally, and immediately in hydrogen gas, which even communicates a positive

polarity.
-- Ozone is absorbed neither by water, caustic ammonia, nor baryta, sulphuric
acid, or dry chloride of calcium.

Schoenbein attributes many of the reactions of oxidation by the “ nascent
state’ of the gas to the presence of ozone.

Dr. Phipson has given many of such examples of polarization explanatory
of the “ status nasvens’ in a prize essay which is contained in the Smithsonian
Report for 1862.

A paper saturated with a solution of iodine is quickly bleached in an ozone
atmosphere; the product, however, does not react acid, and in contact with
oxidizable bodies, such as sulphurous acid, sulphide of hydrogen, phosphorus,
hydriodic acid, metals like zine and tin, or protoxides like those of tin or lead,
the paper becomes brown again from iodine.

Solutions of chlorine and bromine act in the same manner; and it is this
fact, together with the chemical analogies existing between ozone and the
halides, which led Schoenbein to assign to ozone a similar nature.

In the presence of strong bases, such as hydrates of lime or potassa, the
nitrogen of the air may be oxidized to nitre by the action of ozone. ‘Three
thousand litres of ozonized air, agitated with milk of lime, furnish 5 grammes
of saltpetre. Ozone liberates iodine from the iodide of potassium more freely
in the sun than in the daylight; but when starch is present, the blue iodide of
starch is bleached by the light. By renewed action of ozone it becomes blue
again, and the bleaching and bluing may be repeated until the iodide of potas-
sium is transformed completely into iodate of potassa; when ozone is no longer
capable of producing the blue tinge. According to Baumert, the first effect
of ozone upon this salt is the decomposition to caustic potassa and iodine,
which react to form iodate of potassa and iodide of potassium. ‘The. ozone
acts upon this iodide as before, until at length the halide is completely oxidized
to iodate of potassa.

The yellow prussiate of potassa is converted quickly into the red prussiate

by ozone. <A crystal of the former salt placed in an ozone atmosphere be-
comes gradually red, the color proceeding from the outside to the inside, and
the solution of ferrocyanide of potassium experiences this change very readily
when agitated with ozone.

The metals arsenic, antimony, iron, zine, tin, lead, bismuth, silver, and mer-
cury, are oxidized instantly by ozone, and deprive thereby any atmosphere con-
taining that gas.

The metals are not oxidized with equal facility. Thus arsenic is oxidized
much more readily than antimony, which affords an additional means of dis-
tinguishing between these bodies in judicial inquiries. An arsenic spot ina
strong ozone atmosphere is converted instantly to arsenic acid, while an anti-
mony mirror requires several days for its disappearance. Dry mercury, or that
covered with water, does not absorb ozone; if the metal be merely moistened,
it takes up ozone readily, becoming yellowish upon the surface.

Silver, in the state of leaf or sponge, absorbs ozone quickly, as has been
stated already. This metal may be employed for separating ozone from ordi-
nary oxygen.

The more readily oxidized metals, as protoxides of manganese, iron, tin, &c.,
as well as those which, like protoxides of silver and lead, are not so easily
changed to a higher state of oxidation, are peroxidized by ozone.

A solution of the sulphate of the protoxide of manganese is browned in-
stantly in ozone from the above cause, and, according to Schoenbein, this reac-
tion is perceptible in a dilute solution of sulphate of zinc, which contains as
an impurity only ;,5,5 of manganese. If hydrated oxide of lead be spread
upon paper, or if basic acetate of lead be employed, ozone will communicate
to the paper first a yellow, then a red, and finally a brown coloration from the
peroxidation. .

If the lead paper be blackened by means of sulphide of hydrogen, it may
be bleached in ozone, which is due to the production of the white sulphate of
lead.

Organic bodies are very readily oxidixed in ozone, as shown by the experi-
ments of Schoenbein, Baumert, Gorup von Besanez, &c. Thus wood, straw,
cork, starch, humus, vegetable colors, caoutchouc—pure and vulcanized—the
fats and fatty acids, alcohol, albumen, blood, &c., have been found to be all
acted upon by this agent. Ozone bleaches litmus without first reddening it.
Certain fungi become blue in:the air, and the cut surface of an apple becomes
brown by the action of ozone.

Gum guiacum, which becomes gradually blue in the air, owes this change to
ozone, as was first shown by Schoenbein, who employed this substance as a
reagent for ozone. ‘To prepare guiacum papers, one part of the gum is dis-
solved in thirty parts of 90 per cent. alcohol. One gramme of ordinary alco-
hol is charged with a few drops of this solution, and the paper slips are dipped
therein and dried. ‘he papers are blued rapidly in an ozone atmosphere.
‘They lose this color when exposed to the air, but regain it in ozone, and the
process may be repeated until the guiacum is fully oxidized. Certain metals
and other bodies, especially nitrous acid, chlorine, bromine, peroxides of man-
ganese, and lead, &c., will blue guiacum tincture.

The following is Schoenbein’s method of determining ozone quantitatively
in a mixture from its bleaching effect upon the solution of indigo: The ordi-
nary solution is diluted with sufficient water to be just opaque blue. One hun-
dred grammes of this solution receive an equal weight of hydrochloric acid,
and are then boiled. The heated liquid is treated with a solution containing
xia of chlorate of potassa until the blue color is exchanged for a brownish
yellow. If, now, for the destruction of the 100 grammes of indigo solution,
100 milligrammes of chlorate of potassa (which contain 39 milligrammes
174 - OZONE AND ANTOZONE.

of oxygen) were employed, then 1 milligramme of oxygen would destroy
199 —2,564 grammes of indigo solution. Now, to this last quantity of the
original indigo solution, containing hydrochloric acid, enough water must be
added to dilute it to 10 grammes,* in order to obtain a normal solution of
which 10 grammes will represent 1 milligramme of oxygen or ozone. One
part of the above normal solution may be further diluted with 9 parts of water
to yield =, normal test, in which 10 grammes will indicate ;/5 milligrammes of
OZone.

The analysis is performed as follows, for example, upon a bottle of air
ozonized by phosphorus: A little of the normal indigo solution is agitated
with the air in the bottle for afew minutes, and the air is then tested for ozone
by iodide of potassium starch, and the process is repeated until no ozone is

indicated even by a slightly elevated temperature. Then, for every 10.

grammes of the normal indigo solution employed, 1 milligramme of ozone is
present, and for every 10 grammes of the 75 normal solution, 75 of a milli-
gramme of ozone has been found.

Schoenbein discovered the remarkable bleaching properties upon indigo and
other plant colors of certain bodies which appear to absorb ozone, without
combining with it, and thus are in a position to yield the ozone again to other
substances. These bodies have been ealled “ ozone carriers.” They are oil
of turpentine, linseed oil, oil of lemons, tartaric and citric acids, ether, plati-
num sponge and black, powder of silver, gold, and platinum, also metallic mer-
cury. ‘These substances, shaken with solutions of indigo, litmus, cochenille, &e.,
discharge the color; with tincture of guiacum they yield a blue tinge, and give
the same color with iodide of potassium starch. One of the most remarkable
of the ozone carriers is the blood corpuseule. Ozonized oil of turpentine,
shaken with indigo solution, bleaches it after a while, but if blood corpuscules
are added, the decoloration is instantaneous, Platinum black is also very active
in its bleaching effects.

One of the best known ozone carriers is the oil of turpentine. If a bottle
be 4 filled with this body, exposed to the sun, and frequently shaken with air,
removing the stopper from time to time to renew the air, the oil is speedily laden
with ozone. After a time the oxidizing or bleaching effect of this oil is lost,
probably from its ozone entering into combination with it. Its bleaching
effect may be ascertained quantitatively by means of a solution of indigo.
Schoenbein prepared an oil of which 1 gramme possessed the same bleaching
power as 2 grammes of the best bleaching powder, (hypochlorite of lime.)
The ozonized oil bleaches most rapidly when warm, but its absolute decolor-

izing power is then less. All turpentine kept with access of air becomes”

ozonized, as may be seen from the bleached and corroded corks employed in
closing the vessels containing it. Upon the animal organism ozonized oil of
turpentine acts more energetically than oil not ozonized. According to Seitz,
5 drops of ozonized oil throws into convulsions and kills a frog and destroys
other small animals, while 20 drops of the pure oil produce no such effect.
Not long since a statement prevailed that the disease called painter’s colic is
’ due, not to the lead absorbed, but to the oil of turpentine. If this be so, the
ozonization of the turpentine may be the active agent for mischief, although
the lead may also be hurtful.

The existence of ozone in the atmosphere has been known since the discovery,
of the body ; but the conditions which govern its presence, as well as the actual
quantity of the gas, are yet undetermined. This arises from the small amount of
ozone in the air, from the readiness with which this active oxidant is destroyed
by the presence of bodies upon which it may act, and also for the want of a re-

liable quantitative test. The largest proportion with which the air has been
artificially loaded with this substance amounts to too Of its volume.

Ozone may be determined quantitatively by ascertaining the amount of
iodine liberated from iodide of potassium; by determining the quantity of pe-
roxide of silver which it produces; or by finding the proportion of indigo solu-
tion which it decolorizes. But this kind of test has never been applied toa
great extent in determining the atmospheric ozone in long series of observa-
tions, owing to the difiiculty and labor of applying it.

A large volume of air brought slowly to act upon a small proportion of the
reagent is necessary for this purpose. In aspirating twenty-four litres of external
air ue a period of two and a half hours, poacepirating its action upon a
circle 3), of an inch in diameter on a delicate iodide of potassium starch paper,
I was unable to detect the slightest ozone reaction, although a slip of similar
paper exposed all day to the free atmosphere was colored sensibly.

The ordinary mode of observing ozone in the atmosphere consists in ascer-
taining the amount of color produced upon paper containing iodide of potas-
sium and starch, using precautions against the bleaching effect of the light
upon the iodide of starch developed by the ozone. A scale of shades of color
is employed for determining, by comparison, the proportion of the gas in ques-
tion present in the atmosphere. Boehm found that this test, prepared from
the same recipe by different persons, gave varied results. According to Osann’s
formula, thirty-two grains of starch are rubbed in a mortar, with the same
_ quantity of cold water ; three grains of iodide of potassium are then dissolved in
four ounces of boiling water, and the solution is added to the starch and well
incorporated with it. After boiling once more, the test is cooled and placed in
a bottle for use. When reagent paper is required, slips of Swedish filtering
paper are shaken up with the starch liquid, and then dried. ‘This paper is in-
stantly colored of a deep shade of blue when exposed to the ozonized air of a
bottle containing phosphorus and a little water. Exposed during the night to
the atmosphere, the coloration by ozone ig very decided.

In the ordinary atmospheric ozone observations the velocity of the air-cur-
rent which traverses the reagent paper intluences the result by bringing a greater
proportion of ozone upon the test ina given time. ‘The determinations which
have been hitherto made are very vague, unsatisfactory, and yield but rude
comparative results as to the subject in question.

Notwithstanding this difficulty, theories have not been wanting as to the in-
fluence of ozone upon the health. The oxidizing action of ozone upon organic
substances as shown by Gorup von Besanez, the phenomena of ozone carriers,

such as oil of turpentine, platinum sponge, and the blood corpuscules, have
facilitated the formation of such theories.

Dr. Smallwood, in a long series of observations upon the atmosphere of Can-
ada during the prevalence of the cholera and at other times, favored the in-
ference of a deficiency of ozone during the epidemic.

Dr. Moffatt concluded, from a large number of observations in England, that
the ozone in the atmosphere plays an important part in controlling or prevent-
ing epidemics, which it effects by removing the infectious matter from the air.
During the prevalence of the cholera at Newcastle, in 1853, this gas was at
its minimum. From August 24 to September 11, 1854, when the disease was
at its height in London, ozone was observed only once, and then in but small
quantity. On the 10th September a south wind prevailed, by which the ozone
was found to increase, and the cholera cases diminished. During the Crimean
war the surgeons of the I’rench army established the following facts :

1. In proportion as the ozonoscopic papers were more colored in the air, the
more numerous were the sick taken to each of the hospitals.

2. When the temperature was higher, there were fewer sick and fewer deaths.
176 OZONE AND ANTOZONE.

3. At the three observatories the curves designating the proportion of ozone
were essentially the same.

4, The curves for temperature were also identical.

5. At observatory No. 1 the quantity of ozone was znversely proportional
to the number of deaths, while in observatory No.2 this proportion was a
direct one.

Bineau detected ozone but seldom in the air of Lyons, although he observed
it always in the air of the neighboring country. He attributes the deficiency in
the city to the action of organic matter in the air.

Pless and Pierre discovered 0.02 millegramme of ozone in 255 litres of at-
mospheric air.

Zenger found in twelve experiments from 0.002 to 0.01 milligramme of this
body in 100 litres of air.

R. Angus Smith ascertained that the air of Manchester did not react with
ozonoscopic paper, nor was there any reaction in the country when the air had
first traversed the city; which he attributes to the absorption of ozone by the
products of combustion, (antozone ?) arising from the large amount of coal burned
in the city.

C. Kosmann ascertained that in Strasburg, and at a short distance from the
city, there was more ozone in the air of the country than in that of the city.
In the city, the ozone maximum occurred in the daytime; in the country, at
night. He found also, by the action upon Schoenbein’s test paper, that the
green portions of all plants exhale ozone.

Mr. Carey Lea discovered that the growth of plants is retarded in an atmo-
sphere strongly impregnated with ozone.

A. Poey found that in the city of Havana the ozone reaction diminished
with the elevation, while in the country the reverse was observed. He also
discovered that the moisture of the atmosphere influenced the amount of ozone.

I ascertained that the air of the public grounds in Washington yieided, at
night, abundant evidence of ozone, while the atmosphere of the streets of the
city, observed at the same time, indicated an absence of this gaz.

Dr. W. B. Rogers found that the air passing over Boston was deprived of
its ozone by the emanations from the city.

M. Hozeau, of Rouen, inferred, from a series of observations which extended
over four years, that the atmospheric ozone is least in February, begins to in-
crease in March, and reaches its maximum in May and June, after which month
it diminishes to its minimum in February.

J. Boehm has given the results of four years of regular observations of ozone,
made in the city and environs of Prague. His ozonoscopic paper was observed
and changed at 7 a. m. and 7 p. m., the proportion of ozone being determined
by the depth of shade of the color produced. He found that the ozone bears
no relation to the relative humidity, rain or thunder storms, clouds, &c., but is
intimately connected with the force and direction of the wind, which was gen-
erally from the west when the phenomenon of color was observed. The reason
of this fact is the relative position of the observatory to the city of Prague, so
that all easterly winds passed over a thickly-settled portion cf the town, by the
emanations of which they were deprived of their ozone.

in the country and suburbs, Boehm found ozone constantly present. With-
out expressing a decided opinion upon the relation of ozone to health, this
physicist calls attention to the fact that in Koenigstadt, a place not particu-
larly noted for its salubrity, he obtained as decided reactions of ozone as upon
the healthiest mountain, and that the coloration of the test paper is more de-
cided in Vienna, a city noted tor its lung and typhoid fevers, than in Prague,
which is ranked justly with the healthiest towns.

Irom what is known at present respecting “antozone,” it would seem that
this body plays an important part in depriving the atmosphere of ozone.

OZONE AND ANTOZONE. 177

.. In judging from the reaction upon iodide of potassium starch paper, ozone is
always in the free atmosphere in variable, but small, quantity. Such test pa-
pers are not blued when closed in a bottle, and scarcely so, if at all, in a room.
By exposure to the external atmosphere the effect upon them is extremely va-
riable. Sometimes in cities it is imperceptible. According to Osann, the color-
ation is greater by night than by day, and is more decided towards sunrise, at
the time when the atmospheric moisture is precipitated. It is greater in winter
than in summer, stronger with clouded than with clear sky, and is especially
powerful with snow clouds. Every flake of snow falling upon the test paper
produces a blue stain. By atmospheric electrical discharges ozone is, as might
be expected, very prevalent. Schoenbein calls attention to the fact that the
odor in the neighborhood of places struck by lightning is exactly that of ozone.

The whole subject of ozone, whether in its physical or physiological rela-
tions, is intensely interesting, and promises, when understood, to be the means
of solving many problems in the sciences now so ditheult to be comprehended.
No field of research appears to promise so rich a harvest to the skilled and
patient observer.

VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE.

BY J. JAMIN.

TRANSLATED FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION FROM THE ‘REVUE DES DEUX MONDES.”

Persons who are not devoted to the physical sciences will, perhaps, pardon
me if I take the liberty of recalling to them that the air in the midst of which
animals and plants live is a mixture of two very different gases. ‘I'he one,
almost inert and without appreciable influence in the phenomena of nature, is
called azote; the other, on the contrary, possesses the most active properties
and performs the most important part in the support of life on the globe; this
is oxygen. Among other properties it possesses that of uniting with carbon
or charcoal, and while this union, or, to apply the scientific term, this combi-
nation is taking place a considerable quantity of heat and light is disengaged.
The carbon is said to burn, and it was thought at first, without reflection, to
be annihilated; it is, however, merely. transformed into a gas which mingles
with the atmosphere, from which the chemist can recover not only all the car-
bon which has been burned, but all the oxygen which united with it. In order
to recall to the memory the origin and composition of this compound gas it
has received the name of carbonic acid.

Wood, which is essentially composed of carbon and water, burns in the same
manner as carbon, expelling the water in the form of vapor and transforming
the carbon, by its union with the oxygen of the air, into carbonic acid. Fruit,
herbs, bread, and all our aliments, having a chemical composition analogous to
that of wood, may, like it, be burned in a furnace, and Lavoisier has taught us
that the substance of these aliments undergo a real but slow combustion in the
respiratory system of the animals which eat them. Every animal is therefore
a furnace, every aliment a combustible; the oxygen of the air is absorbed in
respiration, is replaced by carbonic acid, and the water ejected by the natural
outiets or by exhalation.

Since carbonic acid is necessarily produced by animal life it must form an
integral part of our atmosphere. Chemists, in effect, detect it there, but in the
‘minute proportion of four or five parts of the acid in ten thousand of air. It is
a gas which can neither support life nor combustion, since it is, on the contrary,
the product of these processes. Hence all animals confined under glass bells,
‘ filled with air, rapidly exhaust the oxygen, replace it by carbonic acid, and
soon die, not from a poisonous effect of the gas, but from a want of respiratory
sustenance.

Having recalled these facts, I shall describe a celebrated experiment which
vegetables themselves are continually performing in our midst without our
having consciousness of it, though it is accomplished on an immense scale, and
may be justly considered one of the most essential phenomena of the world;
an experiment, moreover, so simple that any one may repeat it at pleasure. In
order to success, it is necessary to take a healthy and fresh branch, in full
foliage, of one of those aquatic plants which grow immersed in ponds or rivers ;
introduce it into a glass jar, which is then filled with spring water, or, still
better, with what is called mineral water, which contains, as we know, a large
proportion of free carbonic acid; having closed the mouth of the jar when

VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE. 179

full, we invert it in a basin filled with water; if we then open the mouth the
water will retain its elevation and continue to fill the inverted jar. The appa-
ratus being thus arranged is to be carried to an open place where it can receive
the direct rays of the sun. As soon as the light strikes the leaves of the im-
mersed plant we see them become covered with a multitude of bubbles, which
rapidly enlarge, unite and rise to the upper part of the jar, where they accu-
mulate. Whenever the light is intereepted by the intervention of an opaque
screen the disengagement of bubbles stops, and we can, at will, and even at a
distance, by alternately intercepting the light and permitting it to strike the
leaves, arrest or restore the production of the bubbles. At the end of some
hours of continuous action the jar will be filled with gas, which resembles in
ordinary appearance atmospheric air, but has not its properties, for if we intro-
duce suddenly into the interior of the jar a small taper which has just- been
extinguished, but which still retains at the extremity of its wick a few glowing
points, it again instantly kindles and continues to burn with unwonted brillianey.
The gas is not air, but oxygen. -In this form and with aquatic plants the
experiment is striking, because the production of the gas in this case is rapid,
and we assist, as it were, at the birth of the oxygen. We can produce the
same effect, perhaps less rapidly, with all plants; and in grder not to change
their ordinary condition we may expose them to the sun, under glass bells, pre-
viously filled with carbonic acid; after the lapse of a day the carbonic acid gas
will have disappeared and its place be supplied with nearly pure oxygen.
Whatever may be the plant, or whatever be the experimental process employed,
the action remains always the same. ‘The explanation of the tact is easy. The
green part of the vegetable decomposes the carbonic acid, extracts the carbon,
which it appropriates to itself, and abandons the oxygen to the atmosphere.
In the dark, and during the night, the part performed is changed; then, in-
stead of absorbing carbonic acid, the plant gives it off; but the nocturnal re-
action being inferior to that of the day, the plant performs a part on the whole
which is opposite to that of the animal—it absorbs the carbonic acid which the
latter exhales, and returns to the atmosphere the oxygen which the animal
consumed.

Seeing the experiment so clearly, and its explanation so simple, it is difficult
_ to conceive that they were not seen at the first glance. We find it difficult sto
believe that this was not the case; but every great discovery is made at a cost
to humanity. At the beginning all is obscurity and perplexity, and it is only
after long research and after much hesitation that we settle upon a few scat-
tered truths, and when a clear and steady light illuminates all the previous
obscurity it is only after the labors of several generations are collected and the
efforts of a succession of men of genius have been devoted to the object. The
history of great discovery is not without interest, and I purpose in the follow-
ing pages to retrace the several steps which have led to the establishment of
the relations which exist between plants and the atmosphere, including in the
sketch some of the results of the more recent investigations. »

Charles Bonnet, a Genevese physician, was the first who experimentally un-
dertook, about the middle of the eighteenth century, the problem which occupies
us. It was the perusal of a once celebrated work, The Spectacle of Nature,
which had decided his vocation. His attention was first directed to the subject
of spontaneous generation, a question agitated even at that period, and the inter-
est of which has but augmented with the progress of time. He relinquished this
subject to consider another whose fertility he did not perhaps altogether antici-
pate; it was the inquiry, Of what use are leaves? and he made two experiments
which have acquired a certain classic character. By the first, he proved that
180 VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE.

light exerts over the green portions of vegetables so strong an attraction that,
if placed in the dark, they direct themselves towards the smallest openings
which convey it to them. The second showed that when plunged in water,
plants disengage in sunlight a large quantity of azr ; but there Bonnet stopped:
he knew not what that air was, nor could he know it, since at that epoch the
first principles of modern chemistry were known to none.

Priestley, who was the rival and in some respects the predecessor of Lavoi-
sier, was led by the results of his discoveries to study the action of plants on
the atmosphere. He had just succeeded in isolating the remarkable gas which
energetically supports the combustion of a lamp and the respiration of animals,
and had for this reason called it vital air. He had ascertained, moreover, that
small animals confined in this air or in atmospheric air soon changed its proper-
ties to such an extent that the animals died and the flame was extinguished.
_ It is true, Priestley did not know the real nature of oxygen, and through a blind
feeling of rivalry refused to the end to adopt the theory of respiration just an-
nounced by Lavoisier ; but he knew, nevertheless, how to deduce from his experi-
ments a logical consequence which was of the greatest importance. Perceiving
that these little animals vitiated the confined air by their exhalations, he com-
prehended that all the individuals of the animal kingdom produce the same ‘ef-
fect continually on the entire atmosphere, and that they must infallibly die, if
there were not in the action of natural forces some inverse action constantly
tending to restore to the air its purity, in proportion as this was destroyed by
animal respiration. He proceeded to seek for this counterpoise, this regenera-
tive action, and he found it in vegetables.

He placed in the air confined under a glass bell an animal anda plant. The
former corrupted the air and died; but atter the lapse of a certain time, Priest-
ley discovered that the latter had restored to the air the vital property or the
purity necessary to support life. This was one of the most important facts of
the mechanism of our world. From this moment, it was known, though not
yet in its details, that vegetables and animals execute antagonistic functions,
these rendering the air untit for the support of life, those repairing the mischief.
The Royal Society of London conferred on Priestley, in 1773, the Copley
medal, and in presenting it, the president of that celebrated company thus
characterized the discovery of Priestley:

‘¢Plants do not grow in vain; each individual in the vegetable kingdom, from the oak of
the forest to the grass of the field, is useful to the human race. All plants contribute to
maintain our atmosphere in the degree of purity necessary to animal life. The forests, even,
of the most remote countries contribute to our preservation, while deriving nourishment from
the exhalations of our bodies which have become injurious to ourselves.”

This glory of Priestley, however, was to be overclouded. After such success-
fut labors, such grand and comprehensive views, such rewards and public honors,
Priestley desired to repeat his former experiments, and obtained wholly oppo-
site results; plants, instead of purifying the air, now appeared to him to pollute
it. Surprised at this inexplicable contradiction between the past and the pres-
ent, he multiplied and varied his experiments, and all that he could substan-
tiate was, that vegetables possess the property at one time of purifying, at
another of vitiating the air. he law which had won for him the Copley medal
was therefore not general, and the consequences he had drawn from it not in-
contestable. A refugee in America, after a life agitated by religious discussions,
Priestley died in 1804, having made in chemistry brilliant discoveries which he
did not comprehend, and in vegetable physiology contradictory experiments
which he was not able to reconcile.

Yet Priestley was deceived in nothing; plants do in fact alternately perform
the two functions which he had assigned to them, and the only thing which he
had not diseovered was the condition which determines, frequently the restora-
tive, occasionally the deleterious action, a condition which Bonnet had caught

_

sight of, and which Ingenhousz was soon to place in open day. Ingenhousz was
born at Breda, in 1730; he was a physician, and came to England to observe
the process of inoculation for the small-pox, which was then beginning to be
practiced. It was during this visit that he became acquainted with the labors
of Priestley, and resolved to explain their contradictions; this he succeeded in
doing in 1779, and he has himself recorded his discovery in these words:

“*Searcely had I entered upon these researches, when the most interesting views presented
themselves. I observed that plants not only possess the faculty of correcting impure air in
six or more days, as the experiments of M. Priestiey seem to indicate; but that they accom-
plish this important office, in the most complete manner, in the course of a few hours; that
this surprising operation is by nu means owing to vegetation, but to the influence of the
light of the sun upon the plants; that it commences only after the sun has for some time
risen above the horizon, and that it is completely suspended during the darkness of the
night; that plants shaded by tall buildings, or by other plants, do not perform this function—
that is, they do not purify the air, but, on the contrary, exhale a deleterious air, and diffuse a
real poison through the atmosphere which surrounds us; that the production of healthy air
grows languid towards the close of day, and entirely ceases at sunset; that all plants cor-
rupt the ambient atmosphere during the night; that all parts of the plant are not engaged in
purifying the air, but only the leaves and green branches; that bitter, ill-smelling, and even
poisonous plants perform this office equally with those which difluse the sweetest scents and
are most salutary, &c.”’ *

Ingenhousz had thus succeeded in discovering the force which occasions the
respiration of plants. That force which had not before been suspected is from
the sun, is ight. It diffuses itself over the leaves, which absorb it, and fulfils
the vast work of regenerating the atmosphere. Thus far the most important,
as also the most ditlcult part of the task was achieved; but there remained
yet quite as much to be done. The sciences resemble the sieve of the Danaides ;
each one tries to fill it; no one succeeds, because every discovery discloses a
new horizon and presents a more remote goal which is never attained. After
Ingenhousz, it still remained to be asked in what consisted that alteration of the
air which animals occasion, and the remedy which vegetables supply. It be-
longed to chemistry to answer, and Lavoisier, though not specially operating
with that yiew, furnished the solution of this new problem. He furnished it on
that day when he showed that animals absorb oxygen, burn slowly the organic

materials with which they are nourished and return by expiration a quantity

of carbonic acid containing all the carbon which they have consumed. “The

' vitiated or corrupted air, as Priestley and Ingenhousz called it, was consequently

air deprived of oxygen and charged with carbonic acid, and, since plants purify
it, this clearly indicates that they decompose that carbonic acid, retaining the
carbon and restoring the oxygen to the atmosphere.

Considering the then existing state of chemistry, it might be thought that
every one would have divined and proclaimed this explanation. It was not so,
however, and new experiments were needed to discover it. It was a Genevese
who had commenced this long train of deductions, and it was another Genevese
who had the honor of completing it. His name was Sennebier; he had been
the friend of Charles Bonnet, and to his example owed pursuit of the sciences
as well as the councils which determined him to the study of the relations of
plants and the air. He ascertained that vegetables placed in boiled water dis-
engage no gas in the sun, but that they develop oxygen in abundance when
the water has been previously charged with carbonic acid. He thence con-
cluded that this gas is necessary to the respiration of plants, that it is decom-
posed by them, and thus had the honor of announcing the law already prepared
and discovered by his predecessors. The question might have now been justly
considered as solved; but during these labors, which had occupied more than half
a century, many errors had become mingled with the truths obtained, and con-
tradictory assertions threw doubt upon different points of detail. A review of

all these phenomena was necessary ; it was Thomas de Saussure who under-
took to supply this, and who, without adding any capital fact to the cluster of
previous observations, succeeded in giving them an experimental confirmation
which has not since been contested. After these celebrated experiments, there
was a long period of rest. Physicists and naturalists seem to have considered
the question as exhausted, and transferred their inquiries to subjects which
they thought more fertile. Nevertheless, the more recent labors of MM. Dau-
beny, Draper, Cloés, and Gratiolet, and above all of M. Boussingault, have suc-
cessively intervened to raise difficulties which to this day remain in suspense ;
but I prefer to leave out of view whatever does not possess the interest of the
general theory, and shall speak neither of the azote which vegetables seem al-
ways to disengage at the same time with oxygen, nor of certain deleterious
gases, such as the oxide of carbon and carbonated hydrogen, which M. Boussin-
galt has recently detected among the products of their exhalations ; nor, lastly,
of the attempts made without much success to appreciate the special influence
of the different solar rays. What I wish to show is, that after the first investi-
gations above recounted, we find ourselves confronted by a second class, far
more extensive and complex, with which it is now necessary to deal. It is
necessary to inquire what becomes of the carbon which remains in vegetables
after the decomposition of carbonic acid.

TE:

While the atmosphere furnishes carbon to the leaves, the boughs bring them
water, which has been drawn from the soil, and it is natural to think that these
two bodies, in meeting, pass mutually into combination; they, in effect, do
combine and in very variable proportions ; we will cite some examples: if 12
molecules of carbon unite with 20 moletules of water they are enabled to form
either cellulose, which constitutes at once the vessels and entire skeleton of
the plant, or fecula, which is known by everybody, or lastly dextrine, which
is soluble and of which sirups are sometimes made; but, according jo cireum-
stances and the organs, the proportion of the two bodies may change, and with
it the chemical products which take place. ‘Thus 12 molecules of carbon com-
bined with 14 molecules of water constitute glucose, or the sugar contained in
ripe grapes; and if from this glucose we retrench two molecules of water, it
is the sugar of the cane or the beet which would be formed. In fine, by pro-
cesses which are unknown to us, water and carbon meeting in the leaves com-
bine chemically, and produce an infinite number of compounds, differing ac-
cording to the place, the organs, the nature, the age and the external conditions
of the vegetable.

Besides the substances just spoken of, and which are compounds of carbon
and water, plants give rise to still another class of substances which are char-
acterized by an excess of hydrogen. ‘These are the gums, oils, wax, balsams,
essences, &c. Whence comes this hydrogen? ‘They form also substances
in which a fourth element, azote, makes its appearance. Does this come from
the atmosphere? is it derived from the humus! These are questions which
directly concern agriculture and for which it must consult chemistry. M.
Boussingault is he who has treated of them first and best, and he has been
placed in the most favorable circumstances for doing so, being at the same time
at the head of a great agricultural enterprise, and habituated to the most deli-
cate procedures of chemical analysis. ‘lhe method he employs is proper to
himself; it is sufficiently general and flexible to adapt itself to the demands of
all special cases. It consists as follows: In a soil previously analyzed is sown
a small number of grains whose chemical composition has been determined,
and pure water is applied. This last disappears almost wholly by evaporation,

and a small portion only becomes fixed. ‘lhe plant grows, gains in weight, .

VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE. 183

because it draws nourishment from the air, and also because it seeks some in
the soil. At the end of a certain period of vegetation it is gathered, and then
we ascertain by new chemical analyses, first, how much carbon, oxygen, hy-
drogen, and azote it has gained; secondly, how much of those substances the
soil has lost—that is, how much it has given up to the plant. The difference
is due either to the air or to the water. That settles the account, and event-
ually the balance of profits and losses.

The application of this method, as rigorous in its conception as dificult in
its practice, has disclosed a first fact of the same order as the decomposition of
carbonic acid. All the plants have acquired an excess of hydrogen which
comes to them not from the soil or the air, neither of which contains any ; it
has; therefore, of necessity, been derived from the water. Plants, then, do not
limit their action to separating oxygen from carbon; they also divorce hydro-
gen and oxygen, retaining the first, expelling the second. The water was hy-
drogen burned, as the carbonic acid was carbon consumed; in both cases the
plants have destroyed the effects of the combustion by delivering up the com-
bustible bodies in the state in which they were before they were burnt. In
verifying this action, finally exerted on the water, it has not been ascertained
when it is effected or in what organs accomplished.

A second consequence flows from the analyses of M. Boussingault, namely,
that every plant arrived at maturity has gained azote, which is deposited chiefly
in its seeds ; and as this azote may come either from the air which contains it
in a free state, or from manures which have communicated it to the soil, it was
necessary to institute special experiments to determine its origin. M. Boussin-
gault proceeded as follows: he first sowed trefoil (clover) ina soil formed ex-
clusively of calcined sand, which could only furnish to the plant mineral sub-
stances and the pure water with which it was moistened ; as to azote, it con-
tained none. Under these exceptional conditions the trefoil still completed all
the phases of its vegetation, and in the end it had acquired a small but positive
proportion of azote, which necessarily came from the air. The Jerusalem arti-
choke gave the same result with greater distinctness. After having matured, it
. contained twice as much azote as the seed from which it sprang; but when the
attempt was made to reproduce the experiment with cereals, and above ail
with wheat, it was found that the azote of the grain was carefully preserved,
but had in no degree augmented.

In all these cases the vegetation of the plants was extremely embarrassed,
none of them having the aspect of healthiness which is witnessed in rich soils;
the artichoke, however, suffered less than the trefoil, and this less than the
wheat, which could not advance so far as to mature its grains. 'The reason of
this is evident—azote was wanting; all plants need it, the cereals exact it, and
when they do not find it in the soil they languish and often die. In order to
confirm this conclusion M. Boussingault submitted to a comparative trial three
plants of Aelcanthus placed in three exactly similar pots, filled with pure sand
and moistened with pure water. The first received no manuring, but to the
second were supplied eight centigrammes, and to the third sixteen centi-
grammes of azotate of potash. From the first days the plants exhibited the
difference of the tre:tment to which they were subjected. The first languished
and died; the second vegetated, but remained sickly; the third was remarka-
ble for its fine health. At maturity, the second had borrowed from the soil
four centigrammes of azotate of potash, and the third eight. But what was
chiefly remarkable was, that duriug its progress the last decomposed twice as
much carbonic acid as the second. The azote thus performed the part of ex-
citing the other functions and of giving to the subject which receives it, or of
taking away from that which is deprived of it, the vitality without which it
could not act upon the atmosphere.

’
184 VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE.

Now, be it remarked, a plant contains more than the half of its weight of
carbon and only some thousandths of azote. For what, then, does this sub-
stauce serve in vegetation, which is so necessary to it, although introduced in
so weak a proportion? M. Payen will téach us. According to this skilful
chemist, all the organs of vegetables commence by an azotized matter analo-
gous to fibrine, to which are added by little and little the cellular and fibrous
tissues which, in expanding, produce the entire plant. This fibrine is never
destroyed, is found in all its organs, and is thus the rudiment of all the parts
of the plant, which cannot be developed without it, and consequently without
the azote, which is its essential base. In fine, plants are composed of carbon,
water and hydrogen in excess; they contain besides a fourth simple body,
azote, which occurs in a very minute proportion, but whose presence is essen-
tial to life. The atmosphere furnishes carbon in abundance; water, that is to
say oxygen and hydrogen, is given by the rains; azote is required from the
soil, and as it is rare therein we introduce it under the form of manure. It is
the great care of the agriculturist; it is the heaviest, the most indispensable,
and the host productive of his expenditures.

Ill.

Notwithstanding the important knowledge which we possess on the subject
under consideration, it is still impossible not to recognize on many points the
insufficiency of our information. That which is most inexplicable in our world,
that which should most awaken our curiosity and invite our researches, is the
great physiological fact of which I have related the discovery. The chemists
have assiduously studied carbonic acid; they know all the properties it pos-
sesses: they can foresee all the reactions which it occasions or undergoes in
the conditions in which it pleases them to place it; they are ignorant of none
of the circumstances which produce it or destroy it; but they have never seen
it steadily decomposing under the influence of light in the presence of some
inorganic matter, and yet, what they cannot effect, the smallest leaf shone upon
by the sun produces instantly with a rapidity and abundance which the
naturalist regards with admiration. In ten hours an aquatic plant yields fifteen
times its own volume of oxygen; a single leaf of the water-lily diffuses 300
litres during each summer; and M. Boussingault having directed into a vase
filled with vine leaves, in the sun, a current of carbonic acid, received on its
exit only pure oxygen. Now we are obliged to acknowledge that this fact, so
common, so easily accomplished by the leaves at every hour of the day, chem-
istry can neither comprehend nor imitate.

If we cannot understand and imitate the conditions of a fact relatively so
simple and so definite, what must not be our embarrassment when we would
analyze the chemical and physiological phenomena which ensue from it? We
seé in effect three simple bodies, and rarely four, combine in relations indefi-
nitely variable in order to give rise to the most numerous and different com-
pounds—wood, starch, sugars, oils, wax, balsams, essences, both fragrant and
offensive, delicious fruits and violent poisons, acids like vinegar, and alkalis
like quinine or strychnine, coloring or colorless substances—in a word, products
whose infinite variety transcends the dreams of imagination. Not without dis-
may must we measure the depth of our ignorance in the presence of phenomena
so multiplied, and whose mechanism escapes us so absolutely.

There are, however, ill-disciplined minds which wish to explain everything,
especially what they are most ignorant of. It has been said that plants proba-
bly contained compounds of carbonic acid and of azote, formed at night and de-
composed in the light during the day; it has been also said that there exists
in green leaves a sort of fermentation deriving its activity from the sun, and

whose function it is to decompose carbonic acid. These explanations have not
only the defect of being illusory and conjectural, they are demonstrably false,

‘for the pounded leaves, which preserve the same composition, ought then to

continue the same functions, which is not true. There is also a whole school
of naturalists who content themselves with ascribing the functions of vegeta-
bles to what they call life—a kind of unapproachable foree which suffices to
explain everything by the sole virtue of its name; these appear to me to re-
nounce all of scientitic progress, like the ignorant devotees who explain all
phenomena by saying that God produces them. It is God, beyond a doubt,
who has ordered the world, but he permits us sometimes to inspect the me-
chanism. Without doubt, also, it is life which disposes the functions of beings,
but before proposing it as the final cause and ultimate explanation of facts, it
behooves to know a little what life is, and of what contrivances it makes nse.
We see to what weakness we are reduced as soon as the basis of experiment
fails us, when, in order to fill up the gaps of our knowledge, we strive to grap-
ple ourselves to hypotheses, to unexplained forces which explain nothing. Let
us honestly avow our ignorance, and gird up our loins and seek.

T’o console ourselves for this avowal, which may possibly hurt our self-love,
and to find encouragement for the labors of to-morrow, let us measure, with a
view to their consequences, the importance of the facts which we know to-day.
If plants give out oxygen, animals absorb it, and a compensation is established
between these inverse functions. We can demonstrate it experimentally by
confining under a glass bell an animal anda plant. Separated, each of them
would die—the first by being suffocated in the carbonic acid it exhales, the
second because it would be deprived of this gas which nourishes it. United
in the dark, the animal and the vegetable would injure instead of aiding one
another; but in the light of the sun the life of the one supports that of the
other; the animal, burning his aliments, furnishes carbonic acid to the plant,
and the latter restores to the animal the oxygen which is necessary to it. This
experiment would be in little the image of the world, and it is thus that Priestley

- conceived the eternal equilibrium of it. Nothing can be more grand and

beautiful than this thought, but it is necessary to complete it. If the bell of
which we have just spoken were very small, the least excess which might occur
in the respiration of the animal, or the least interruption in the action of the
sun, would exaggerate the quantity of carbonic acid and cause first the animal
to perish, and then the vegetable. Are we, then, exposed on the earth to alike
danger, and are plants so necessary to us that we must cease to live as soon as
they should cease to act? Believe it not, for we shall demonstrate that this
fear would be -vain. The human population of the globe may be approxi-
mately rated at a thousand millions of individuals, and we shall not be far
from the truth in assuming that all other animals taken together exert upon
the atmosphere, by their respiration, an effect equal to that of three thousand
millions of adult men. This makes for the whole animal kingdom a population
equivalent to four thousand millions of human beings. Now, as the mean
quantity of oxygen which an adult human being consumes in a day has been
measured, we can calculate that of the total population of the globe. It is
very great, no doubt, but, on the other hand, the provision of oxygen in the
atmosphere is greater still. It is so much greater than the consumption of
animals that it would require eight thousand millions of years to exhaust it.
In eight centuries it would fail but a millionth part, and if the vegetables
ceased their action, it would require at least two thousand years before the
nicest chemical analysis could avail to detect a change in the composition of
the air. The service that vegetables render us is therefore much less imme-
diate than Priestley thought; it is a service of distant reversion, and we may
without ingratitude relegate our acknowledgments to posterity.
.

186 VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE.

But the earth is quite old, and it is not impossible that its atmosphere has
undergone, since the creation, progressive changes which have become very
considerable through the lapse of so many ages. We have here a very curious °
question, which has been considered by M. Brougniart, and which we will
proceed to study with him. The earth covers enormous, we might say inex-
haustible, masses of carbon under the form of coal, anthracite, lignite and peat,
and it cannot. be doubted for an ‘instant that these deposits are not the accumu-
lated fossil remains of innumerable vegetables. Now there is for a plant but
one single mode of acquiring carbon—to imbibe it in the form of carbonic acid
from the air, and consequently all those masses of coal which cover Belgium,
England, a large portion of America, and which are found at all points of
the globe, were once diffused in a gaseous state through the atmosphere;
they were there combined with oxygen, and the globe in the beginning was
involved in an aeriform envelope which contained azote, a great deal of car-
bonic acid, little or no oxygen. If we add that, at the moment, the earth was
incandescent, we see that all the carbon must in effect at that temperature
have been burned on contact with oxygen.

Thus constituted, the earth cooled down; but the composition of its atmo-
sphere rendered it uninhabitable for animals, since they had need of oxygen
and there was none, since they would have been suffocated in the carbonic
acid and azote which prevailed at the moment. Hence the first strata of sedi-
mentary deposits contain no animals. In return, the earth was as favorably
prepared for the production of plants as it was unfit for the nourishment of
animals; it was soon, therefore, covered with luxuriant forests, whose remains,
in accumulating, formed coal. We find therein all the species then living.
There were gigantic eguisetums, arborescent ferns comparable to our oaks, and
palms which towered above everything that the vegetable kingdom now offers
us. And while these immense deposits were forming, oxygen, perpetually dis-
engaged by the action of the sun, was gradually impregnating the atmosphere
-and preparing it for the advent of the animal tribes. Of these, in due time,
the first creations made their appearance, having since varied from age to age.
At the epoch of the coal formations the forests were tenanted by huge reptiles,
cold-blooded animals, for which little oxygen sufficed ; but it was not till after
the nearly total disappearance of the carbonic acid that the earth witnessed
the arrival of the mammifers, which had awaited a richer atmosphere.

There are those at once timorous and ignorant who seriously ask what will
become of the earth and themselves when mankind have burnt up all the coal.
I will tell you, honest folks, what will become of us. The coal will have
again been converted into carbonic acid, oxygen will have disappeared, and
the creat vegetable tribes will return; but-if it is true, as they would persuade
us, that the animal species, by growing gradually more perfect, have advanced
from the primitive forms up to man, the return of the elements to their point
of departure would bring man back to his origin by an inverted degenerescence.
To have had crocodiles among our ancestors, be it so; but to see in perspec-
tive a posterity composed of ichthyosauri, this certainly is the most disheart-
ening of metempsychoses !

But to return to serious matters: if we are ignorant of the mechanism of
the living organs, at least we know the functions they fulfil, and can express
clearly the part which they play in the physical world. With the water and
azotized substances which they take from the soil, with a gas which they col-
lect in the air, vegetables compose organic matter, which they accumulate in
their tissues and which they hold in reserve for the use of animals. The vege-
table kingdom seems to be only a great laboratory, an atelier of production
where every plant has the same function—that of forming materials as varied
in their composition as are the forms of each one of them.. To this common

VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE. 187

character it is necessary to add another, which is that receiving as primary
material carbonic acid and water, substances burnt, plants have the faculty of
expelling the oxygen and of extracting from them the carbon and hydrogen,
to which they restore the property of being susceptible of being burnt anew.
These chemical actions take place within their organs, but these organs are
only the seat of them; the cause of these actions is without; it proceeds from
the sun. :

The animal has received a diametrically opposite mission. It creates not,
it destroys; in place of solidifying the liquids and gases, it separates them and
restores them to the atmosphere; in fine, far from bringing back bodies to the
combustible state, it burns them. The herbivorous animal derives all his nour-
ishment from plants; he transforms a part of them into water and carbonic
acid, he accumulates the rest in appropriate organs. ‘The carnivorous profits
of these reserves, and finishes by restoring to the atmosphere what vegetables
have extracted from it ; what the herbivores have preserved of it, and whatever
the class to which it appertains, every animal rejects by the natural ducts an
abundant provision of azotized matter which it deposits on the soil. It is pre-
cisely this matter which vegetables take up again, without which they cannot
live, which they possess the power of elaborating, transforming, accumulating,
and which they return to animals after having restored to it the nutritive quali-
ties which it had lost. Thus is closed that admirable circle of opposite trans-
formations and of mutual services where we see the animal and the vegetable
eternally exchange the same matter; this, which receives it gaseous, disoxi-
dizing and solidifying it; that, which receives it combustible, again dispersing
anew after having burnt it. Priestley saw in plants predestined servitors whose
office it is to purify the air; but they have another function much more imme-
diate and render us a service quite otherwise indispensable, that, namely, of
extracting and prgparing our aliments. Their action on the air would only be
sensible after a long succession of ages; but if a single year drought annihi-
lated the fruits of the earth, a frightful famine would destroy in a short time
all the animals which the globe nourishes.

From the sun it is that daily nourishment, life, force, and all our power is
derived. The light, the chemical emanations, all the rays which that orb sends
us, are extremely rapid vibrations, analogous to those produced by sound ;
there is movement, there is force; as soon as it reaches the plant that force is
absorbed, it disappears, it is extinguished. But no force is extinguished ex-
cept on the condition of having produced an effect, performed a work which is
its equivalent. Now the work performed by the light which the leaves absorb
is decomposing the carbonic acid. So, too, let it not be forgotten, there is
needed a given amount of force to disunite a given quantity of oxygen and car-
bon; it is the sun which every hour of the day furnishes it gratuitously.

If now we place in presence of one another this oxygen and carbon, and,
by an inverse operation, combine them by burning this carbon, they will pro-
duce, in uniting anew, all the force which it had been necessary to expend in
order to separate them; that is to say, all which the sun had furnished. There
will be heat and light, as experience shows, and there will be force also, which
may be collected by means of calorific machinery and employed in our service.
And we shall do well to reflect that it is the sun which has prepared for us
that heat, that light, and that foree; which has furnished to the carboniferous
forests at an epoch when man as yet: was not, what man recovers and disposes
of to-day.

And what is true of our inanimate furnaces will! be found to be repeated in
those living furnaces which we call animals. They likewise burn organic
material, produce heat which elevates their temperature, and develop force and
movement: a force which they do not create, which they owe to that very com-
188 VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE.

bustion, and upon the same terms as do steam-machines; a force previously in-
fused by the sun into plants, absorbed by them, virtually preserved in their
products which are our sustenance, which we disengage by respiration and
which our muscles apply under the direction of our wants and our will. This
whole grand generalization of the phenomena of the world is the work of mod.
ern chemists and physicists. It was MM. Dumas and Boussingault who first
disengaged it; the mechanical theory of heat completed and demonstrated it;
but it already existed entire in the conception of Lavoisier when he wrote:

“Organization, spontaneous movement, life, exist only on the surface of the earth in
places exposed to the light. It might be said that the fable of the torch of Prometheus was
the expression of a philosophical truth which had not escaped the ancients. Without light
nature would be without life—it would be dead and inanimate. A beneficent God, in sup-
plying light, has spread over the surface of the earth organization, sentiment, and thought.”

TY.

If during the regular course of its existence, a vegetable accumulates organic
matter, there are nevertheless two moments when it loses this essential character
and comports itself like the animals: it is at the commencement and the end of
its life, when it germinates and when it reproduces itself. very seed, besides
the embryo which for long years preserves the principle of life, encloses a pro-
vision of organic matter destined for the first nourishment of the springing plant.
Cast on a warm and humid soil, it germinates; its radicle seeks in the soil a
point of support and liquids; the germen rises upward; the seminal leaves or
cotyledons are developed, and the rudimentary plant is established in virtue.of
intrinsic and transmitted life. Now, during this first period, the provision of
accumulated matter is divided into two parts: one is burnt by a sort of respira-
tion, the other, undergoing complicated chemical actions, is transported into the
organs and there becomes fixed inconstituting them. Everything occurs nearly
as in an animal and without any intervention of light; but after this primitive
phase, when the respiratory organs have received their first development, the
plant waits for the rays of the sun to continue its evolution, and, as soon as
these reach it, it inclines towards them as if eagerly to collect them, it becomes
green, and commences, only to desist at its death, that decomposition of car-
bonie acid and that accumulation of matter which is its function and its pre-
destination.

In order better to study this period of intrinsic life in the seed, M. Boussin-
gault conceived the happy idea of prolonging it by indefinitely retarding the
action of the light. The experiment was made with peas, in a soil without
manure. After having germinated, they continued to grow, giving forth a pale,
siender, creeping stem which at length perished without having borne seeds.
During this whole period the peas continued to work up the organic material
originally contained in the seed, and in proportion as their life was laboriously
prolonged, they dispensed it by little and little in order to sustain it. At last,
each plant had lost more than half the carbon which the seed had originally
provided. While this experiment was going on in darkness, other peas, sowed
at the same time, were successively transferred into the light. From that
moment everything became changed; real life was developed, and the plant,
being now able to avail itself of the nourishment contained in the air, gained
each day, in the sun, very nearly as much carbon as it had previously con-
sumed in darkness.

In nature all things touch upon one another: vegetables in the seed, animals
in the egg, appear to accomplish the same acts and exist in the same conditions.
In both cases, a mass of organic matter accompanies the germ; the egg and
the seed may preserve for an indeterminate length of time the virtual principle
of life. A little heat will commence the evolution, and from that moment the

VEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE. 189

organic matter, absorbed by the nascent tissues, transported by the vessels which
are forming, takes its place in the organs into whose constitution it enters. Dur-
ing this whole period, the plant and animal subsist on their own resources,
drawing nothing from without, and to complete the analogy, they burn a por-
tion of their own substance. By and by, when all is exhausted, the animal,
already formed, is prepared to live, as the plant, already delineated, is prepared
to vegetate, anda common want displays itself at the same moment in both
existences: that of finding external nourishment. From this point all analogy
ceases, and the separation of the two kingdoms commences. The vegetable
ereates and reduces, the animal destroys and oxydizes.

Let us pursue these analogies. In every flower that opens, botany of late
has shown us the organs of two opposite sexes which concur, each after its
character, in the fecundation of the germs. Now, at this moment, when the
flower seems to borrow that sexual.function of reproduction which we might
think to be the exclusive privilege of animals, it again imitates them in burning
the organic material by an active respiration. ‘ All flowers,” said Priestley,
“invariably exhale a deadly air during the day and during the night, in light
and in darkness.”’ Daily experience confirms this assertion, and De Saussure
has shown that this poisonous gas is carbonic acid. At last one of our most
justly celebrated chemists, M. Cahours, has given us the results of a recent and
complete study of this respiration of flowers and fruits under all circumstances.

If itis true that this combustion of organic matter, that this expenditure
and loss of force, be necessary in itself to accomplish the act of fecandation, it
is in the sexual organs especially that it should be present. Tixperiment in
effect has confirmed this conjecture, and it has even been ascertained that it is
the stamen, the male organ, which dispenses the most. Nor does this fact stop
there. All combustion disengages heat: it is to their respiration that animals
owe their high temperature, and it is of course necessary that the stamens and
pistils should develop heat since they respire. The question was to find ther-
mometers sufficiently sensitive and a suitable plant. ‘The first vegetable which
has allowed the verification of a rise of temperature is one which would never
have been suspected of so much ardor, the pumpkin. Its flowers are large,
and admit of the introduction of the air-thermometer; some of them are male
and others female, and the latter have evinced a greater degree of coolness than
the former.

Still the gourds, melons, and pumpkins grow warm in but a slight degree,
and so, it might be said, resemble.the cold-blooded animals. ‘There are plants
‘which resemble the warm-blooded animals, and these are the Arums. One of
them, the Arum maculatum, which is found abundant in hedges, is enveloped
in a rolled leaf which encloses the flower in a chamber, and which prevents the
heat from being dissipated in space. Observe now the singular phenomenon
which has been perceived by Lamarck, Sennebier, Bory de Saint Vincent, and
by De Saussure himself. Habitually the Arum is cold, but at a given moment,
which must be watched and skilfully improved, the temperature of the plant
raised from 7 to 8 degrees above that of the atmosphere. Hubert, a truly sa- —
gacious observer, succeeded in introducing a small and very sensitive thermome-
ter, sometimes among the stamens, which became heated to 22 degrees, some-
times among the pistils, which produced an action one-half less. The other
parts of the plant manifested no special action. By care and watchfulness, De
Saussure surprised four Arums at the moment of calefaction, and placed them
under a glass bell filled with air. The glass was immediately covered with a
moisture which attached itself to the surface, a great absorption of oxygen took
place, and a correspondent production of carbonic acid. In its chemical acti n
and the energy of that action, the plant was comparable to a smallanimal. At
another time De Saussure decomposed the plant into different parts, which he

studied separately: the sexual organs consumed 132 measures of oxygen, and
the rest of the flower only 30. . ~

After fecundation, the fruit begins to be developed and the plant to nourish
it. Not only does the plant furnish it with the matter accumulated in its own
tissues, but with a quantity greater still, which it burns by a respiration proper
to it. The whole lite of the vegetable seems then exclusively devoted to the
accomplishment of this last duty of nourishing the fruit. In this task it im-
poverishes itself; the beet and the cane dispense all the sugar they possessed,
every plant exhausts the provisions which it had accumulated in the period of
its youth, and when the fruit is mature, the vegetable, if it is annual, is reduced
to a dry skeleton, and if it is perennial, sinks into the repose of winter, to re-
cover its forees and recommence, the following year, its providential function.

The subject under consideration, besides the questions of detail which I pro-
posed to examine, contains a great truth with which I shall conclude, namely,
that our world does not suffice for itself, because it is deficient in force; but it
receives this from the sun, diffused upon it in the form of rays. And it is by
virtue of this:action that life on the globe is transmitted under two antagonis-
tie forms—vegetable life, which accumulates force by creating organic matter,
and animal lite, which consumes and dissipates that which the sun furnishes,
that which vegetables absorb and treasure up.

EXTRACT OF A MEMOIR

ON THE

PRESERVATION OF COPPER AND IRON IN SALT WATER,

BY M. BECQUEREL.

BUREAU OF NAVIGATION, Navy DEPARTMENT,
8 Washington, Aprtl 20, 1865.
Dear Sir: The protection of the bottoms of iron vessels from corrosion by sea water, and
from fouling with animal and vegetable matter, is one of the subjects referred by this Depart-
ment to the National Academy of Sciences for examination and report. I need not enlarge
upon its paramount importance. A memoir by M Becquerel, on this subject, in the first
number of the fifty-ninth volume of the Comptes Rendus, has recently attracted my notice,
and I think the publication of it in English may be serviceable by calling the attention of

' professed chemists and other systematic experimentalists to the strictly scientific treatment

of the question.
I have the pleasure, therefore, to send you the accompanying translation, which I should
be happy to see preserved and widely circulated in the pages of your valuable reports.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
C. H. DAVIS,
Rear-Admiral, and Chief of Bureau of Navigation.

Tue preservation of metals at sea, especially of copper and iron, has in our
time become a vital question on account of the transformation of the navies of
all nations; a transformation suited to bring about a change in their mutual

.relations. Since this question falls within the province of the physico-chemical

sciences, I have considered it my duty to give it particular attention, with
the hope of adding by my own eflorts some new data in aid of its solution to
those which we already possess.

This question presents great difficulties, proceeding from numerous causes
which contribute to the alteration of metals. All these causes, whether me-
chanical, physical, or chemical, exercise an influence over chemical action, and
consequently over the production of electricity, which gives rise to isolated
voltaic couples. They can only be effectually controlled by the closest investi-
gation and by contending, so to speak, with each of them singly.

Finding it impossible to communicate the whole of my labors to the Academy,
I shall confine myself to laying before it a concise abstract of the principal results
of my investigations, in order that it may get an idea of their whole scope; but,
before doing so, I will cite those results which have already been obtained on the
same subject, and thus make the Academy acquainted with my point of departure.

In a lecture delivered January 22, 1824, before the Royal Society, ( Annales
de Chime et de Physique, t. xxvi, p. 24,) Davy informed his audience that
the rapid change in the copper-sheathing of vessels-of-war, and its unequal
durability, had excited the particular attention of the lords of the admiralty,
who employed him to investigate the means of preserving the sheathing; and
that he immediately undertook a series of researches which led him to the dis-
covery of an important principle, according to which a metal which is electro-
positive in salt water, being converted into an electro-negative, is preserved
from all alteration, at least within certain limits.
192 THE PRESERVATION OF

Davy admitted the theory of contact, that is, the production of electricity
by the contact of two metals, resulting from mutual action, Chemical action,
according to him, only served for the transmission of electricity from one body
to another. This view prevented him from deducing from his discovery con-
sequences which naturally flow from it. His first statement was, that a piece
of zinc of the size of a pea, or of the point of an iron nail, was quite sufficient
to preserve from 40 to 50 square inches of copper wherever placed, and that a
little piece of zine having been fixed on top of a piece of copper, and a much
larger bit of iron below it, and the whole immersed in salt water, the cop-
per not only was preserved on both sides, but the iron also, which, after a
fortnight, had kept its brightness equally as well as the other metal. He con-
cluded from this, at once, that small quantities of zinc, of iron, or of cast-iron,
when placed in contact with the copper-sheathing of vessels, prevented its cor-
rosion. He added, besides, that, since negative electricity could not be regarded
as favorable to animal or vegetable life, because it caused the precipitation of
magnesia upon copper, a substance very prejudicial to land plants, this elee-
tricity ought to help to keep the bottoms of vessels clean.

The lords of the admiralty having furnished him with the means of experi-
menting on a large scale with his mode of preserving the copper-sheathing of
-vessels at Chatham and Portsmouth, he established the following facts :* Sheets
of copper in contact with zine, iron or cast-iron, over 25 or gq/oq part of their
surface, having been exposed for several weeks in the harbor of Portsmouth to
the action of the tide, and their weights having been determined before and
after the experiment, Davy found that when the metallic protector covered a
surface of from =}, to ;4,5 of the copper, neither corrosion nor diminution of the
latter metal took place, but when the ratio was from 5345 to zi the copper under-
went a loss of weight greater in proportion as the protection was smaller. He
considered cast-iron, a substance so readily and cheaply found everywhere, as
the best and the most appropriate for the protection of copper, and as lasting
as long as iron and zine.

The sheets of copper of two small vessels, thus protected, were kept per-
fectly clean for several weeks, as long as the metallic surface of the copper
had remained uncovered; but as soon as the metal was covered with carbonate
of lime and magnesia, plants and insects collected there.

Again, we find the following facts in the Philosophical Transactions of Lon-
don tor 1825, pp. 340 et seq.:

‘*The first experiment of this kind was tried on the Sammarang, of 238 guns, in March,
1824, and which had been coppered three years before in India. When she came into dock
at that time, before she was protected, she was covered with thick green carbonate and sub-
muriate of copper, and with a number of long weeds, principally fuci, and a quantity of
zodphites, adhering to different’ parts of the bottom. For the purpose of protection, Davy
employed cast-iron, equal in surface to about 75 of that of the copper, which was applied in
four masses, two near the stern, two on the bows. She made a voyage to Nova Scotia, and
returned in January, 1825. When she was again brought into dock, there was not the
smallest weed or shell-fish upon the whole of the bottom from a few feet round the stern-pro-
tectors to the lead on her bow. Round the stern-protectors there was a slight adhesion of
rust of iron, and upen this there were some zoéphites of the capillary kind, of an inch and
a half or two inches in length, and a number of minute barnacles, both Lepas unatifera and
Balanus tintinnabulum. Jor a considerable space round the protectors, both on the stern
and bow, the eopper was bight; but the color became green towards the central parts of
the ship; yet even here the rust or verdigris was a light powder, and only small in quan-
tity, and did not adhere, or come off, in scales, and there had been evidently little copper
lost in the voyage.

“The yacht Elizabeth was protected by about +45 part of malleable iron placed in two
masses in the stern. She had been occasionally employed in sailing, and had been some-
times in harbor, during six months. When Davy saw her, at the end of this time, she was
periectly clean, and the copper apparently untouched. Her owner informed him that there

* Philosophical Transactions, 1824; Annales de Chimie et de Physique, t. xxix, p. 187.

COPPER AND IRON IN SALT WATER. 193

never had been the slightest adhesion of either weed or shell-fish to her copper, but that a
few small barnacles had once appeared on the loose oxide of iron in the neighborhood of the
protectors, which, however, were immediately and easily washed off.

‘¢ The Canebrea Castle, a large vessel of upwards of 650 tons, was furnished with four
protectors, two on the stern and two on the bow, equal together to about 7)z of the surface
of the copper. She had been protected more than twelve months, and had made a voyage
to Caleutta and back. She came into the river perfectly bright, and when examined in the
dry dock was found entirely free from any adhesion, ard offered a beautiful and almost pol-
ished surface, and there seemed to be no greater wear of copper than could be accounted for
from mechanical causes.”

It follows from the preceding facts that, whether in sea water or the salt
water of the laboratory, the copper sheets which are at rest in salt water in-
crease in weight by becoming covered with earthy or alkaline deposits when
they are protected by a proportion of iron below +35; and if this proportion be
contained between ;1, and 7,455, the surface seems to be preserved without
receiving either deposits or zodphytes or shells.

It appears that Davy devoted himself to determining the limits on the sur-
face within which the protection takes place, but not at all in the thickness.
He neither takes into account the layer of oxychloride of zine nor of copper,
oxychloride mixed with particles of one of these two metals, which, by op-
posing the reaction of salt water, stops the protection. The whole question
lies there, and Davy studied only the theory of contact. ;

Although several of the preceding experiments have furnished favorable
results, nevertheless the process of protection was not adopted; the reason
assigned for it was the negative condition of cepper, which favored the deposit
of marine bodies to such an extent as to diminish the rate of sailing.

We shall see presently that the deposit of marine bodies was not to be
attributed to this cause, since the major part of the protection had disappeared.
It has been remarked, however, that in order to preserve the copper the pro-
tecting metal must be oxidized. He had such a strong belief in this theory
that he asserted that a piece of zinc of the size of a pea, or the point of an iron
nail, was suflicient to protect copper plates of 256 to 320 square centimetres of
surface, immersed in sea water; this preservation could last only for a short
period, as the piece of zinc, or the point of a small iron nail, was rapidly de-
stroyed. There is, withal, in this nothing to inform us whether, in the means
of preservation employed at sea, a thought was given to the disadvantages
resulting from the destruction of the oxidable metal; it is not, therefore, aston-
ishing that the copper-sheathing became foul, to use the seaman’s phrase, and
was covered with organic bodies. In addition to the above, it is the same with
regard to the production of electricity for preserving copper or iron at sea as
with regard to the production of heat; in the latter case it is necessary to keep
up the supply of the combustible material, and in the former to provide for the
replacement of the oxidable metal according as it is destroyed; this is an indis-
pensable precaution to secure its preservation.

The causes of change in metals are numerous. We will cite particularly the
heterogeneousness of parts : the difference in the mode of aggregation of particles,
the presence of any bodies whatever on the surface of metals, of grains of sand
for example, or spots of rust, strokes of the hammer falling here or there, pres-
sure, a simple fold or corrugation, &c., are so many causes which give rise to
voltaic couples on the surface, and which destroy a protection otherwise suitably
selected. The friction of water must still be added, as M. Ed. Becquerel has
shown in the interesting experiments which he repeated at Toulon, while aiding
me in my investigations.

From this it may be seen why it is that metals like iron, that are forged,
wrought, and hammered, present so many causes of change, which are removed
by means of protectors, arranged according to electro-chemical principles. This
explains, what experiment proves, why it is that the electrical condition of the
protected metal does not always follow a regular law.

18 s
194 THE PRESERVATION OF

IT have been guided in my researches by an important consideration, which T
will here mention: it has been discovered, that in order to decompose one mil-
ligramme of water, it was necessary to employ in the form of a current a quan-
tity of free electricity equal to that of 20,000 batteries, each of one square metre
of surface, and charged in such a way as to give out sparks flying more than
one centimetre in length. This is the quantity supposed to be combined with
the substance and which becomes free on the decomposition of one milligramme
of water, or which experiences some kind of transformation, either by becom-
ing heat or by being changed into a vis-viva, of which I have tried to deter-
mine the effects in the cases under consideration. This much is certain, that but
an exceedingly small portion of the enormous quantity of the electricity capable
of producing the effects of thunder is collected ; but before arriving at this de-
termination I have investigated with the utmost minuteness, by means of the
compass of sines and suitably arranged apparatus, the electro-motive force of
zine as well as that of iron, of copper, of lead, and their alloy, plunged in sea-
water, which forces beara relation to the developed affinities and naturally serve
as starting points for finding the protecting metal or alloy; this latter acting
only with etliciency when the negative condition of the protected metal, which
is derived, is superior to that which it assumes when it is attacked by salt
water. I subsequently determined the electrical condition of all the compo-
nents of a protected metal in order to see what became of the vis-viva, of which
I have just spoken, and to discover the laws upon which it will be necessary
to rely to secure protection. My mode of proceeding was as follows:

When a copper plate 5 metres in length and 6 centimetres in width, con-
taining a surface of 3,000 square centimetres, and armed at one of its extremi-
ties with a very small band of zinc one centimetre square, and furnished at short
distances with vertical rods of the same metal and other details, is plunged into
sea water, it will be found that from the zinc to the other extremity of the plate
the electrical condition of each point of the latter gradually diminishes, and
if the curve of the intensities be traced, by taking for the axis of the ab-
scissas a line which represents the electro-motive force of copper, for the abscis-
sas themselves the distances to the zinc, and for ordinates the corresponding
electrical conditions, this curve will appear to have the axis of the abscissas
for its asymptote, showing that it cannot be determined how far the protection
extends. ‘I'he whole surface of the copper retains its brightness, with the ex-
ception of the part on the side of the zinc to a distance of about one or one and
a half metres, which becomes covered with earthy metallic deposits when the salt
water is not pure. In another experiment made at sea, the law has been veri-
fied to about fourteen metres. It is evident, therefore, that in the oxidation of
the zinc the electricity which ceases to be united with the substance, and which
is enormous in amount, acts as a living force, when it is transmitted to the eop-
per at distances the precise limits of which are not known. We must not for-
get here to observe that there are in circulation over the whole metallic surface,
by means of the liquid which moistens it, derived currents which produce elec-
tro-chemical decompositions, and which are created at the expense of the elec-
tricity disengaged in the oxidation of the zine.

‘Hence we pereeive, that if we wish to protect a copper surface in sucha
manner as to avoid electro-chemical deposits, we must arm the surface with a
metallic protector having an electro-motive force equal to that of the point where
these deposits begin to be insensible; this is an important condition to fulfil in
order to prevent deposits of shells and other marine bodies, which seem to be
formed on parts already covered with limestone, magnesia, and other substances.

Copper plates armed with iron, and iron plates protected by zinc, present
similar effects, with the slight difference that the sphere of electric action is less,
it being understood that its extent depends on the difference between the elec-
tro-motive forces of the protecting and the protected metal.

COPPER AND IRON IN SALT WATER. 195.

One can hardly form an idea of the slight space which it is sufficient to give to
the zine and to the iron in order to produce on the metals which they are pro-
tecting the effects we have just mentioned; thus the quantity of metal needed
to protect the iron of an armed vessel becomes insignificant.

The protecting alloys of zine and copper, of zine and lead, &c., act, in pro-
* portion to the more oxidable metal which enters into their composition, with
certain conditions of hardness, to which regard is to be paid. With an alloy
of copper and zinc, the protecting power diminishes, according as this last metal
is oxidized and carried off, when there remains finally nothing but a copper
sponge, which is soon changed into oxychloride; the greater the hardness of
the alloy the slower the production of the effects here mentioned.

The experiments of which the principal results have been stated had to be
repeated in the open sea. The minister of marine, fully appreciating their im-
portance, was kind enough to put at my disposal in the harbor of 'Toulon all
the necessary means for making these experiments. I cannot sufficiently thank
him, as well as M. Dupuy de Léme, the latter particularly, on account of the
useful information which he so kindly furnished me in respect to what con-
cerns the applications of my experiments. I also thank MM. the naval engi-
neers for their co-operation, and M. de Mouy, sub-engineer, who, having followed
my experiments with attention, will be able to repeat them. The experiments
have been made on a large scale and have not left any doubt as to the accuracy
of the results obtained in the laboratory, and have enabled me moreover to
make new observations, which are of interest in applying the experiments. I must
mention here some observations which ought to be taken into consideration.

Whenever the iron plating is covered with several coats of red lead, it is
preserved as long as the paint lasts; but as soon as it is partially removed,
either by friction or by the dissolving action of the sea, which is slow, the
metal begins to be attacked at different places; those parts which have lost paint
are negatived relatively to those which preserve less of it, or none at all; so that
these last suffer more than the others. rom the above causes spring those local
changes seattered occasionally over the surface of the plating, which will be easily
avoided by the employment of protectors, disposed according to principles here
laid down—protectors which will not come into use until the paint is carried off.

The copper sheathing of the bottom which is not painted, being in the same
condition as that of the old vessels, will be exposed to the same disadvantages,
unless it be protected not only with a view to its preservation, but still more
for preventing deposits of earths and other matters, which seem to favor deposits
of shells, mollusks, and marine plants, which it is said do not occur as long as
the surface continues bright.

All the parts constituting the sheathing and the armor have been so well ad-
justed by M. Dupuy de Lome, that it will be quite easy without disturbing
anything to apply the protectors in such a manner as to clean the former or
change them as need be.

It will even be possible, when the vessel is on the point of leaving the basin
to enter the harbor, with the aid of apparatus I constructed for this purpose, to
see if all metallic parts are completely protected, or in case they are not, to
discover the amount of change. ;

Such are the general results arrived at during the long investigations con-
ducted either in the laboratory or in sea water upon the means to be used for
preserving the metals employed for the plating and sheathing of iron-clads, and
for preventing deposits of shells and other marine bodies. .

It is quite impossible for me in this extract to enter into details concerning
the measures to be taken for the preservation of metals, an account of which
is given in this memoir; it is sufficient for me to say, that the general principles
appear to be well established, and that the only questions still waiting their
solution are those which relate to the application of these principles in detail.
PRESERVATION OF WOOD.

TRANSLATED FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BY C. A. ALEXANDER, FROM THE LEIPZIG “‘AUS DER ~
NATUR. U. S. W.”

TE increased consumption of wood, more especially in the construction of
railroads, has rendered the question of a future supply one of no little interest.
Its importance, however, results not so much from the quantity employed in con-
struction, great as that certainly is, as from the rapid decay of the sills of rail-
roads and the consequent necessity of frequent renewal. A resort to the harder
kinds of wood in place of the softer was an obvious and early expedient; but
little is thereby gained, for the former also harbor within themselves the germ
of destruction, and under the influences of the atmosphere pass speedily through
the stages of decomposition. _ :

Of course this process is more rapid in certain kinds of wood, and is the
effect of a greater proportion of cellular tissue containing nitrogen. It is to
this that wood, exposed alternately to moisture and dryness, owes its decay,
because the proteine substances, as the nitrogenous combinations are called, pass
into fermentation, develop carbonic acid, and thus produce the gradual decom-
position of the mass, although the secoud chief constituent of wood, the so-
called cellulose, is in itself unalterable, and resists all destructive influences.
The more proteine, therefore, contained in the wood, the more easily and earlier
does it undergo decomposition.

Railroad sills of oak were found to last longer than those of softer wood, yet
even these, though chosen with care, sufficed but for some ten years’ service, and
then for the most part required to be renewed. But through the exclusive use of
oak for this purpose, it was soon observed that the forests were becoming thinned
beyond all hope of restoration, and that the price of this wood had advanced to
a most inconvenient extent. These annually increasing disadvantages have had
the effect of directing inquiry to the practicability of replacing, for many differ-
ent purposes, the use of wood by that of other materials, chiefly stone and iron;
but for the sills of railroads this substitution has not been found toanswer. Here,
therefore, it was necessary to think of other means for prolonging the duration
of wood, or at least for communicating to the soft woods, of which our forests
are chiefly composed, a degree of durability which should qualify them to supply
the place of the harder kinds.

Plans for the conservation of wood are just as little as the wasting of the
forests an incident of yesterday or to-day. As early as the reign of Charles
II, of England, Lord Caernarvon had said, “ Wood is an outgrowth of the earth
which nature provided for the payment of our debts,” and the first proposal for
the preservation of wood by chemical means dates from that period. Of this
the celebrated Dutch chemist, Glauber, was the author. ‘'T'wo other proposed
methods date from the last century, and since the beginning of the present a
great number have been brought forward. All those heretofore devised, and
which have had in view chiefly the preservation of railroad sills, depend—

1. On the abstraction of water from the wood before using it;

2. On the elimination of the ingredients of the sap;

3. On the chemical alteration of those ingredients;

4. On the mineralization of the wood.

Of the various proposals for this purpose we can here notice only those which

PRESERVATION OF WOOD. 197

have obtained a certain notoriety. Among these may be classed that of Kyan,
who proposed to steep the wood in a solution of chloride of mercury, or to press
the latter into it. So strongly had this method been recommended that the
building of the Leipsic-Dresden railroad was deemed a suitable occasion for put-
ting it to the proof. 'The superstructure of this road was formed, after the former
' American system, of long wooden sills, strengthened by cross-ties, with iron
rails attached, and these sills it was proposed to protect from decay by treating
them in Kyan’s much-extolled manner, with an infusion of chloride ef mercury.
The experiment, however, yielded a most unfavorable result. In the tirst place,
the cost exceeded all expectation, amounting in the case of hard wood to $1,500
per mile, and in that of soft to as much again. Moreover, the solution had
penetrated the hard wood to the depth of but two or three lines, and hence the
protection was highly problematical. It is true that by frequent treatment or
by pressure a complete penetration of the wood might have been effected, but
in that case the expense would have certainly countervailed every advantage.
In England the same experiment has been tried with several railroads, and also
with the pins used in the wooden pavements of London. 'Thesills of the London
and Birmingham railroad were entirely decayed in three years, while those of the
Great Western road, after six years, were still fresh and sound. These different
results are attributable to the different modes of impregnation and to the con-
tents of the respective liquids. The pins of the London pavement were found,
after forty-six months, to be totally decayed.

Dr. Boucherie, of Paris, has acquired much repute for his method of preserv-
ing wood by means of copper vitriol, an expedient to which he was determined
by long and sedulous experiment. So favorable were the results that, in 1856,
after seven years’ experience, large contracts were made with him for the im-
pregnation of the sills of railroads and posts of telegraphs. In considera-
tion of important public services thus rendered, the jury of the great industrial
exhibition of Paris, in 1855, on the concurrent recommendation of two sections,
awarded to Dr. Boucherie a large medal, while the public authorities, on the
same grounds, extended his patent five years beyond the limited time. The
basis, as well as the scientific principle of his procedure, is supplied by the as-
sumption of the circulation of the vegetable sap, the existence of the cellular
tissue, and of tubes within the plank through which this cireulation is conducted.
The second postulate is the possibility of displacing the sap and substituting a
fluid possessing preservative properties.

In 1838, Dr. Boucherie obtained a patent for a process which depended en-
tirely on the circulation of the sap. Upon this first system, a tree with its full
garniture of boughs and leaves was sawed off, and its lower end sunk perpen-
dicularly in the fluid, which thus ascended with the sap to the top of the tree.
This process, though satisfactory in a scientific point of view, was not adapted
to practical use. It remained to discover some means of causing the conserva-
tive fluid to penetrate intu the felled tree without recourse to the natural cireu-
lation of the sap. Repeated experiments showed that it was practicable, by a
high pressure, to expel completely the watery particles which remain for some
time in the cells of felled trees, and to replace them by some other fluid. The
problem was thus narrowed to the determination of a suitable fluid, and the
application of a cheap and practical method of expelling the sap and introdu-
cing its substitute. é

After employing, experimentally, various antiseptic substances, Dr. Boucherie
obtained the most satisfactory results with a solution of the sulphate of copper
(copper vitriol) in water. This substance, when introduced, is destined to a
two-told purpose—to expelthe sap, which is the cause of decomposition, and to
fix itself in the wood.

A small portion of the sap adhering to the inner walls of the cells is required
for the fixation of the sulphate of copper; a combination of the two forms a
covering which withstands external action, whether in the air, the earth, or the
198 PRESERVATION OF WOOD.

water. Of this fact ocular proof may be had, if, by means of strong hy-
draulic pressure, we drive the albuminous substances from a stick of wood and
prepare it after the prescribed manner. The vitriolic solution which is received
at the end of the wood, where it flows out, possesses the same properties as atits
introduction; there has been, therefore, little or no intermediate action. For
every sort of wood there is a certain degree of pressure under which the prep-

aration yields the best results. Nor is the strength of the vitriolic solution of
~ Jess consequence than the force of the pressure: too weak, the effects are cor-
respondent, unless much time is allowed for the preparation; by to> great con-
centration, on the other hand, we injure the absorbing vessels of the cellular
tissue, and the preparation becomes difficult, if not impossible ; the wood in this
case may be said to be scorched and corroded by the acids. The proportion
recommended is a solution of one pound of the sulphate of copper in one hun-
dred pounds of water. The water to be used for this purpose must be pure
and as free as possible from calcareous salts.

All kinds of wood are not suitable for this impregnation. Certain kinds
have isolated parts, where the sap is arrested, and no passage is allowed for
the solution. In the oak, for example, the sap only is penetrable, while the
pith resists penetration. The beech even, which is highly adapted to impreg-
nation, often shows, near the pith, a red portion, in which the sap becomes in-
spissated and allows no passage. The birch and yoke elm admit of easy and
thorough preparation, provided the age of the former be not more than forty
nor that of the latter more than one hundred years. The pine, the linden, the
plane, the service tree, the elm, and the aspen are well adapted to this purpose.
In all trees the sap is the part most susceptible of impregnation, and this part,
which is usually considered as unserviceable in constructions, the process of
Dr. Boucherie renders fit for employment. The same is the case with many
kinds of wood which grow in wet grounds, whose affluence in albuminous sub-
stances would, without such preparation, subject them to rapid decay.

For the success of the proposed method, it is indispensable that the juices of
the tree should possess their full degree of fluidity, so as to yield readily to the
pressure by which the preservative liquid is introduced. From the 1st of Sep-
tember, in many countries, but in general from the 15th of that month onward,
the vegetable activity diminishes, the leaf changes color and soon falls. * At
this period the sap becomes thinner, circulates with more facility, and yields so
much the more readily to the antiseptic liquid. Trees felled in September,
October, and November may await preparation for a longer time, in proportion
as they were later cut. ‘he more advanced the season, the less is the tendency
of the sap to coagulate and obstruct the vessels of the cellular tissue. In trees
felled in October this condition scarcely supervenes before the end of November,
while in those severed in January, February, and March, provided the boughs
be left entire, the fluidity of the sap continues till the end of May. In general
the sap of standing trees attains its highest degree of tenacity from the middle
of April to the beginning of June; trees felled at this season, which is the most
unfavorable, admit only of difficult and imperfect preparation. During the
following months of June, July, and August the process should be applied
within eight days from the felling of the tree, else the dryness, which promotes
coagulation in the still otherwise tenacious sap, will tend to embarrass the upe-
ration and in some cases render it very impertect. As a general rule it may be
assumed that the most favorable epoch for the impregnation of wood is that in
which the felling is generally considered as advantageous.

At whatever time the impregnation may be undertaken, it is always of great
importance to select the soundest and straightest timber, and such generally as
had not begun to decay and is free from clefts. The antiseptic liquid, on its
introduction into the wood, will take the course where it meets with least
obstruction, and if faults like those mentioned exist, will find through the
yielding or divided parts a channel of escape.

iT.

The measures above recommended must be observed if the subsequent steps
are expected to result in success. We proceed now to describe the arrange-
ments for conducting the process, which are very simple, and shall confine our-
selves in the main to those intended for the preparation of railroad sills, merely
noticing any differences which may exist in the case of materials intended for
other purposes.

All the logs designed for sills should be cut into pieces whose length so far
exceeds that of a double sill as to admit of the renewal, at the time of the
operation, of the surfaces at the ends of the pieces where the sap soonest grows
dense and obstructs the passage of the injected fluid. For this excess a length
of 30’ is enough if the tree, especially in hot weather, be felled but few days
before the preparation. ‘To arrange the place of operation, we lay on a surface
properly levelled four beams parallel to one another, with an inclination of
za in the direction of their length, which length should be such that at least
twenty logs may be placed across the beams at an average distance of 2’ 6 from
one another.

Along the outer beams channelled logs or troughs should be laid for the pur-
pose of receiving the liquid as it escapes from the ends of the sill-pieces; and
the two inner beams must be placed at such a distance from the middle line
of the whole construction as to leave between them sufficient room for a channel
destined to receive a leaden pipe, which connects with the vessel containing the
vitriolic solution. ‘This pipe is furnished with copper taps at distances of 2’ 6”,
corresponding with the middle of the sills which are to be impregnated. The
fluid, which passes through the sills and falls into the channels provided for
that purpose, is conveyed by them into a receptacle below the level of the gen-
eral stage of operations, whence it may be drawn by a pump, and, if needed
for further use, filtered and restored to its original strength.

The impregnating fluid is contained in three vessels, which are stationed on
a platform, at least 25’ high in the middle of the works, and which are furnished
with faucets, issuing a little above the bottom of the vessels, in order that im-
purities may have room to settle below the vent. Each of these faucets com-
municates by means of an India-rubber tube with the leaden pipe, which ter-
minates at the sides of the vessels in three branches. Near at hand is a pump
to supply the water required for the solution. Of the three vessels, one is de-
signed to feed the leaden distributing pipe; the second receives the water raised
by the pump, or the fluid that has been already once used; in the third, the
prepared fluid is allowed to rest, that impurities may be deposited. This last
vessel is connected with the distributing pipe as soon as the first is emptied.

The logs to be impregnated are laid upon the beams and wedged, so that
their ends shall be perpendicular over the channelled logs or troughs, and their
direction at right angles with the beams, Whatever may have been the lapse
of time since the felling of the trees, the end surfaces of the logs should be re-
newed, that the injected fluid may more readily pass through, besides that the
requisite length may thus be given to the material. Everything being thus
arranged, an incision is made with a saw in the middle of each log to the depth
of ;*, of the vertical section in soft, and still deeper in hard woods. By means
of a jack-screw the middle of each logis then slightly raised, whereby the incision
will be opened, and not far from this incision, in each half of the log, a hole is
bored obliquely from the external surface of the log through the face of the in-
cision, which must be carefully freed from any chips or saw-dust. In the inci-
sion we now lay a ring of cord or rope, the outer circumference of which must
exactly correspond with that of the log; but, while thus preparing to close the
opening, care should be taken that the ring do sot descend too deep into the
200 PRESERVATION OF WOOD.

wood and obstruct unnecessarily some of the tubes destined to convey the anti-
septic fluid.

The screw by which the middle of the log was raised being now withdrawn,
the log of course sinks, the two side walls of the incision approach, pressing
together the included cordage, the circuit of the opening is completely closed,
and thus an artificial reservoir is formed in the midst of the piece which is to
be impregnated.

Into the hole, bored as above directed, a tube of hard wood is driven, and is
fastened to one of India-rubber which has been previously adjusted to the cop-
per taps of the leaden pipe, thus establishing a communication between the
small reservoir in the middle of the log and the distributing apparatus. During
the preliminary steps, the India-rubber tube is closely compressed by means of
a hand-serew, but when, at the commencement of the process, this is removed,
the impregnating fluid flows into the reservoir prepared for it in the log, and

‘drives the sap before it through the pressure exerted by the fluid in the vessel
which feeds the supply tube. Under favorable circumstances this effect is
instantaneously manifested by an exudation at the end of the log, which pres-
ently changes into drops, and falls into the channel provided for it. ‘To remove
any included air which might interfere with the process, a small hole should be
made with a copper pin through the cord enveloping the incision, which must
be closed with the stroke of a hammer as soon as the fluid begins to issue. It
will also greatly promote success, if in the course of the operation the incision
be occasionally well cleansed, and again closed with the same care as at first.

The sap, which at first issues pure, becomes more and more mixed with the
vitriolic solution as the process approaches its termination. When this mix-
ture shows 3° (its normal strength being 1°) the penetration of the wood may
be regarded as complete, and for pieces of the length of a railroad sill, the time
in which this result is reached may vary from 48 to 100 hours; all pieces
which, after the lapse of the latter period, do not exhibit in the centre of the
end-surface a readily distinguishable impregnation, must be turned, and the
operation conducted in the opposite direction.

For the preparation of longer pieces, such as telegraph poles, building ma-
terials, &c., in which the difficulties are greater, it will be useful to observe the
operation conducted in the opposite direction.
