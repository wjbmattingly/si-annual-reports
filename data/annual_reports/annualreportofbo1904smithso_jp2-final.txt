APPENDIX TO PROCEEDINGS OF REGENTS.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON THE TRANSFER OF THE REMAINS OF JAMES
SMITHSON TO THE UNITED STATES.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: As the committee charged with the duty of bringing
to the United States the mortal remains of James Smithson, the
founder of the Smithsonian Institution, I beg to report the successful
accomplishment of my mission; and the remains were handed over
to the Smithsonian Institution last Monday, the 25th of January,
1904.

I reached Genoa, Italy, on the 25th of December, 1903, and next
day presented my credentials to the American consul, Mr. William
Henry Bishop, and to Mr. Noel Lees, for the committee of the
British Burial Ground Fund Association.

On the 29th of December I made formal application for the
remains of James Smithson, and on the 3ist of December they were
delivered into my custody. In accordance with the expressed wish
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. X XI

of the Regents, the exhumation was effected quietly and privately,
only the American Consul and six other witnesses being present in
addition to the workmen employed.

I have the honor of submitting the following certificate from the
American consul describing the exhumation :

THE CONSULATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Genoa, Italy.
'To whom it may concern :

I, William Henry Bishop, consul of the United States of America, do hereby
certify that on Thursday, December 31, 1903, at about 11 o’clock in the morn-
ing, I was present at the opening of the grave known without doubt or question
to be that of James Smithson, in the old English cemetery of San Benigno at
Genoa, said James Smithson having died at Genoa in the year 1829, and having
been buried till now in the said cemetery. That on the opening of the grave
the remains, consisting of little more than the skeleton, were seen clearly
exposed. to view, since no earth had been thrown upon the body, and the wooden
coffin that contained it had entirely fallen to decay; that said remains were
reverently removed from the grave and pliced in a metal casket prepared to
receive them; that the said metal casket was thereupon sealed up securely
and put in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery, as in the custody of Dr. Alex-
ander Graham Bell, to await his convenience in conveying it to America.

I further certify that there were present with me, and witnesses of all the
circumstances of the above-described exhumation, the following persons: Dr.
Alexander Graham Bell, Washington, ID. C., especially commissioned by the
Smithsonian Institution to convey the remains of James Smithson to the United
States; Mrs. Alexander Graham Bell, his wife, Washington, D. C.; Noel Lees,
esq., Genoa, Italy, official representative of the British Burial Ground Fund
Association, in which the proprietorship of the said cemetery of San Benigno
is vested; Gino Coppede, Genoa, architect and engineer, charged with the work
of opening the tomb and grave of the said James Smithson, and of removing
all the belongings of the said cemetery to the new site to which it is to be
transferred; Giovanni Battista Firpo, Genoa, gardener by profession and paid
custodian for many years past of the said cemetery and of the grave of James
Smithson, having succeeded his father in the same office; Federico Guarini,
the municipal guard deputed by the bureau of hygiene to be present on the occa-
sion; Paolo Parodi, metal worker and chief undertaker, in transferring the
remains to the casket and soldering up the same.

That the above-mentioned persons are all personally known, to me, and known
to fill the various functions respectively assigned to them above. That they
have consented to be sworn as to the matters herein alleged, and that each has
appended his signature hereunto as making oath to the truth of the statements,
so far as each one individually is concerned, above set forth.

In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and affixed my seal of

[ SEAL. ] WILLIAM Henry BISHOP,
Consul of the United States of America at Genoa, Italy.
Xxit PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The above certificate of the American consul was signed by the
witnesses named in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery after the
casket had been soldered up in their presence. The witnesses named
and the workmen employed then stood around with uncovered heads
while the consul of the United States placed over the remains of
James Smithson the American flag.

The casket was left in the mortuary chapel to await my convenience
in transporting it to America; and Giovanni Battista Firpo, the
gardener employed by the Smithsonian Institution as the custodian
of the grave of James Smithson, was left in charge—he agreeing to
remain in the mortuary chapel night and day until the removal of the
remains.

On Saturday, the 2d of January, 1904, the foregoing witnesses
again assembled in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery, and in their
presence the metallic casket was placed within a coffin of strong wood.

Before the lid of the coffin was screwed down our consul, Mr.
Bishop, placed upon the casket the seal of the consulate of the United
States and covered the casket with an American flag. Mrs. Bell then
placed within the coffin a wreath of leaves from the grave of Smith-
son, and all the witnesses contributed flowers.

Immediately before the removal of the remains from the mortuary
chapel the following addresses were made:

REMARKS OF WILLIAM HENRY BISHOP, UNITED STATES CONSUL.

[On the occasion of the removal of the remains of James Smithson from the mortuary
chapel of the cemetery of San Benigno, January 2, 1904.]

Dr. ALEXANDER GRAHAM Bett: You arrived here, my dear Dr. Graham Bell,
charged by the Smithsonian Institution with the mission of removing to Wash-
ington the remains of the founder of that Institution, James Smithson, who has
been buried till new in the cemetery where we stand, since his death at Genoa
in the year 1829. Having been invited by you and by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution to aid you to what extent I might be able in this object, it has been a
matter of great pride and pleasure to me that I have been allowed to do so.

All the steps necessary to such removal have now been taken. We have
received the authorization of the governmental heads of the province, the city,
and the British Burial Ground Fund, in which latter the title to the cemetery
and the custody of the grave of James Smithson is vested, and all of these have
kindly cooperated with us in the work.

The body of James Smithson has now been reverently raised from the earth;
it has been placed in A case securely sealed, and this case stands ready to pass
into the charge of the steamship company which will convey it to New York.

T assure you that it is with a feeling of real emotion that IT have just now
east the American flag over the body of this illustrious man, this noble but as
yet little known benefactor, as it is on the verge of beginning its journey to the
United States. The flag adopts him already, as it were, in the substance, for
our country, to which he has so long belonged in the spirit. He is now about
to receive there a portion of the outward veneration and homage he so supremely
ynerits, and which, owing to the modest circumstances of his life, and his inter-
ment here in some sense almost forgotten, he has never had.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XXITI

Shal! I admit that on taking possession of my post as consul at Genoa, I
did not even know who,James Smithson was? I may say that I was surprised
to learn that he was buried* at Genoa; more surprised still that he was an
Englishman, whe had never even set foot in America. He left his great bequest
to the United States, then ‘in its infancy, through admiring confidence in our
future. It is likely that many, or even most, Americans ave in the same condi-
tion as was I myself; for occasion has rarely arisen for taking thought as to
the personality of the man. Happily this unenlightened condition of mind is
about to cease.

Dr. Graham Bell, I wish you a hearty godspeed across the ocean with your
precious freight. The American people will receive it with general gratification,
and, through the Smithsonian Institution, will soon delight to pay it great honor.

REMARKS OF ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE.

Mr. Consun: It is with feelings of deep emotion that I undertake the trans-
portation of the remains of James Smithson from the cemetery where they have
so long reposed to their Jast resting place in the United States.

On behalf of the Smithsonian Institution allow me to thank you, Mr. Consul,
for the unwearied zeal and care with which, you have given me your assistance.
Without your active cooperation and without your personal sympathy it would
have been difficult indeed for me to have accomplished the object of my mission
here,

On behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, IT beg to thank you, too, Mr. Noel
Lees, for your courtesy and attention; and trust that you will convey to His
British Majesty’s consul-general and to the committee of the British Church
Burial Ground Fund my thanks and the thanks of the Institution I represent
for their ready assistance in furthering my mission.

The United States of America will provide in Washington, D. C., a suitable
and permanent resting place for the remains of her great benefactor, James
Smithson, through tle instrumentality of the Smithsonian Institution—the
establishment created by the Government to perpetuate his name.

REMARKS OF NOEL LEES, ESQ.
[On behalf of the British Burial Ground Fund Committee. ]

Dr. GRAHAM Bett: I beg to thank you heartily for the words you have said
with regard to the aid you have received from the burial board and myself.
Although we regret to lose the remains of James Smithson, we at the same
time feel that in the country to which he left his money, with such charitable
intent, his remains will receive the honor and glory which have so long been
due to them, and we must understand that our loss is America’s gain. ‘To us
it will always remain a pleasant memory that, from the date of his burial
to the present day, we have had in our custody in this picturesque little
churchyard the remains of a man whose foresight and kindness have enabled
so many in the New World to benetit.

Upon the conclusion of these remarks the remains of James Smith-
son were transported to the North German Lloyd steamship Princess
Trene, accompanied by the American consul and myself. The steamer
left Genoa for New York on the 7th of January, 1904, touching at
Naples and Gibraltar on the way. The American consul at Naples,
General Byington, contributed an American flag to cover the wooden
coffin containing the remains.

‘
XXIV PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Not knowing the nature of the reception arrangements that were
being made in the United States, I telegraphed from Gibraltar to my
son-in-law, Mr. Gilbert H. Grosvenor, expressing the hope that the
remains of James Smithson would be received with as much honor as
those of John Howard Payne.

After conferring with the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, Mr. Grosvenor laid the substance of my telegram before the
President of the United States, who immediately responded by
requesting the Secretary of the Navy to detail the U. S. dispateh-
boat Dolphin to meet the Princess [rene on her arrival at quarantine,
escort her to the pier at Hoboken, N. J., and then bring the remains
to Washington.

At the request of Mr. Grosvenor a squadron of United States cay-
alry was also detailed to escort the remains from the navy-yard to
their resting place here. Mr. Grosvenor has made a report to me of
the correspondence which resulted in this cooperation of the United
States Government, which will be found in the appendix.

As your committee charged with the duty of bringing the remains
to the Smithsonian Institution, I have expressed to the President
and to the Secretary of the Navy and to the Secretary of War my
sincere appreciation of these acts of courtesy, which have given a
national character to the reception accorded to the remains of James
Smithson on their arrival in the United States.

On Monday, the 25th of January, 1904, I handed over, at the
Smithsonian Institution, to Senator Frye, as the representative of
the Board of Regents. the remains of this great benefactor of the
United States.

IT have the honor to present as an appendix to this report the fol-
lowing documents:

A. Copy of the application of your committee to the committee of the British
3urial Ground Fund Association for the custody of the remains of James Smith-
son, with the reply.

B. Copy of the application of your committee to the prefect of the province of
Genoa for permission to remove the remains of James Smithson to the United
States, with a copy of the decree permitting such removal.

C. Copy of a certificate made by the British consul-general at Genoa, at the
request of the municipal bureau of hygiene, stating that no objection existed on
the part of the British consulate-general to the removal of the remains of James
Smithson.

I may say that it is entirely due to the ability and energy of our
consul at Genoa that the transfer of tlfe remains to the United States
was effected at all. Without his earnest and intelligent assistance it
would have been difficult indeed, if not impossible, for me to have
accomplished the object of my mission abroad. No less than five dis-
tinct permits had to be obtained from different government officials
in Italy, besides a certificate from the British consul-general and per-
mission from the British Burial Ground Fund Association. In addi-
tion to the official permits required special difficulties were encoun-
tered which at first sight seemed insurmountable, but which were
successfully overcome by the tact and ability of our consul at Genoa.

Respectfully submitted.

DEAR Str: IT have the honor to request that the remains of James Smithson,
now resting in the old cemetery on the heights of San Benigno, be delivered to
me for transportation to the United States.

By the will of James Smithson the United States of America became his heir.
The Government of the United States accepted the bequest; and, in conformity
with the terms of the will created in Washington, D. C., an establishment for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men under the title of “ The Smith-
sonian Institution.”

It appears that an immediate necessity exists for the removal of the remains
of this great benefactor of the United States from the cemetery where they have

so long reposed; and it seems peculiarly appropriate that the body of Smithson

Sir: 1. I have the honor to inform you that the Navy Department has ordered
the Dolphin to escort the Princess Irene to her pier at Hoboken, after which she
is to receive the remains of the late James Smithson.

2. The commandant of the navy-yard, New York, will send a tug alongside
the Princess Irene after she arrives at her pier, and has made the necessary
arrangements with the health and custom authorities so that there will be no
delay in-transferring the remains to the Dolphin.

3. The Dolphin will anchor off the Battery and remain there until early day-
light of the next day after the remains have been received on board when she
will sail for Washington, D. C. In case you wish to accompany the remains to
Washington I am authorized to offer vou a passage on the Dolphin. It was the
intention of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Professor Langley, to
write to you in regard to this matter, so that you would receive the letter off
quarantine.

4. In case there are to be any passengers for the trip to Washington it is
requested that they be on board by midnight of the day on which the steamer

to Senator Frye as the representative of the Board of Regents, together with
the reply of Senator I’rye.

REMARKS OF A. G. BELL.

Mr. SENATOR: I have the honor of handing over to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution the mortal remains of its founder, James Smithson, fellow of the Royal
Society of London, England, who died in Genoa, Italy, on the 26th of June, 1829.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. X XIX

For nearly seventy-five years the body of Smithson has lain in an almost
forgotten grave in the picturesque little British cemetery on the heights of San
Benigno, in Genoa. City improvements have now rendered necessary the expro-
priation of the cemetery andthe removal of the remains; and at the last meet-
ing of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution | was appointed a
committee to arrange for the transfer of the body of Smithson to the United
States.

Upon my arrival in Genoa - was afforded every possible facility for the
accomplishment of my mission by the provincial and municipal authorities, by
His British Majesty’s consul-general (Mir. Keene), and by the committee of the
sritish Burial Ground Fund Association, in which is vested the ownership of
the cemetery, as well as by our own consul, Mr. William Henry Bishop, to
whom I am indebted for invaluable assistance.

On the 31st of December, 1903, the tomb of Smithson was opened in my
presence as the representative of the Smitbsonian Institution, and in the
presence of the American consul, Mr. Bishop, and six other witnesses. The
remains of James Smithson were reverently raised from the grave and placed
in a metallic casket, over which the consul of the United States cast the Ameri-
can flag, while the witnesses stood around with uncovered heads.

The casket was left in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery—securely sealed
and under guard—until the 2d day of January, 1904, when it was placed in a
coffin of strong wood, as required by Italian law, and was then removed to the
North German Lloyd steamship Princess Trene, accompanied by the American
consul and myself.

The steamer Jeft Genoa on the Tth of January; and upon arrival in the
United States the remains of James Smithson were received with national
honors by direction of the President and of the Secretary of the Navy and the
Secretary of War.

The remains were transported to Washington op the U. S. dispatch boat
Dolphin, and have been escorted to the Smithsonian Institution by United
States cavalry.

And now, Mr. Senator, my mission is ended, and I deliver into your hands, as
the representative of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Tnstitution, the
remains of this great benefactor of the United States.

REMARKS OF SENATOR FRYE.

Sir: The Smithsonian Institution receives with profound gratitude the
remains of its distinguished founder. Providence, every now and then, seems
to place in the world a man and inspires him with a purpose to elevate his
fellow-men. Such a man was Mr. Smithson, the founder of this Institution.
The spirit, sir, which prompted you to such earnest endeavor, resulting as it
did in taking these remains from their resting place in a country foreign to
him and foreign to us, and bringing them here, where for so many years we
have enjoyed the rich fruits of his splendid benefaction, your countrymen will
appreciate. His grave here will be an incentive to earnest, faithful, wise, and
discreet endeavor to carry out his lofty purposes, and, sir, it will be to our
people a sacred spot while the Republic endures.

APPENDIX H.—feport of Mr. Gilbert H. Grosvenor, M. A., coneerning the cor-
respondence which resulted in the cooperation of the United Ntates Govern-
ment in transporting the remains of James Smithson from New York to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

Wursarp MrMorIAL HALL,
Washington, D. C., January 23, 1904.

Dear Mr. Bett: I beg to submit the following report on arrangements for
the reception of James Smithson. On January 7 I received the following cable-
gram from you:

“GENOA, January 7, 1904.
“ GILBERT GROSVENOR,
“Memorial Building, Sixteenth and AW, Washington, D.C.

“We bring Smithson’s remains steamship Princess Irene, touching Naples
and Gibraltar. See Henderson, Hitt, Langley about formalities of landing and
transfer to Washington.

“GRAHAM BELL.”

‘
XXX PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

I thereupon consulted with Mr. Langley who assured me that all formalities
were being arranged so that the remains might be admitted into this country
without delay. On Sunday, January 10, I cabled to you at Gibraltar as
tollows:

“BELL, Princess Irene, Gibraltar.
* Congratulations. Formalities arranged.
“ GILBERT GROSVENOR.”

On Monday, January 11, I received the following cablegram from you:

* GIBRALTAR, January 11, 1904.
“ GILBERT GROSVENOR, Washington. D. C.

“ Hope Smithson’s remains will be received with as much honor as those of
John Howard Payne. Notify me at quarantine what to expect.
“GRAHAM BELL.”

Upon receipt of this message I called upon Dr. S. P. Langley and expressed
your desire that suitable honors be rendered James Smithson upon the arrival
of the remains in this country. I then addressed the following letter to the
President of the United States, Hon. Theodore Roosevelt :

“ HUBBARD MEMORIAL HALL,
“Washington, D. C., January 11, 1904.

“Sir: The remains of James Smithson, the founder of.the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, are now being brought to the United States by Dr. Alexander Graham
sell, one of the Regents of the Institution. The remains left Gibraltar this
morning on the steamer Princess Irene, and are due in New York about the 20th
instant. Dr. Graham Bell has cabled me urging that. the remains be received
with as much honor as those of John Howard Payne. It would seem most
appropriate that a Government vessel, a ship of war, a revenue cutter, or even
a tug, be detailed to meet the Princess Irene when she enters the harbor of New
York and receive Smithson’s remains. This official tribute from the American
nation seems due a man who bequeathed his entire fortune to a people whom he
had never seen. As the time is urgent I take the liberty of addressing you
directly, rather than through oflicial channels. I would respectfully beg, in
case your honor does not deem it fitting to order detailed a vessel to welcome
Smithson in the harbor of New York, that I be so informed at once, in order
that private plans for paying honor to this illustrious benefactor may then be
carried out.

“T beg to remain, most respectfully,
“ GILBERT H. GROSVENOR.

* Hon. THEODORE ROOSEVELT,

“ President of the United States.”

On Tuesday, January 12, I received word from the Secretary of the Navy that
my request for a war ship had been approved by the President, and I was asked
to send a formal application for the detail of the Dolphin. I thereupon for-
warded the following application :

“ JANUARY 12, 1904.

“Sir: Pursuant to the request from the Secretary of the Navy, I beg herewith
formally and respectfully to petition that the Dolphin be detailed to receive the
remains of James Smithson, the founder of the Smithsonian Institution, in New
York Harbor and convey them to Washington. I beg to remain,

“Most respectfully,
“ GILBERT H. GROSVENOR.

“TIon. ‘THEODORE ROOSEVELT,

“President of the United States, Washington.”

The Dolphin was thereupon detailed and ordered to New York.

On January 18 I called upon the Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Adna R. Chaffee,
and requested a military escort to receive the remains of James Smithson when
they reached this city, and on January 19 forwarded the following formal
application :

“ JANUARY 18, 1904.

“Sir: The remains of James Smithson, the founder of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, will reach Washington on Friday or Saturday of this week, The remains

are to be brought from New York on the Dolphin, which was especially detailed
by the Secretary of the Navy _to proceed to New York. receive them from the
Princess Irene, when the latter ship arrived from Genoa, and bring them to
Washington. When the Dolphin veaches this city the remains will be conveyed
without ceremony to Oak Hill Cemetery, where they will be deposited until
action is taken as to their final disposition. It would seem most appropriate
that an escort of 50 or 100 cavalrymen be detailed to accompany the remains
from the dock to the cemetery. I have the honor to respectfully request,
therefore, that an escort be detailed for this purpose. For your information I
heg to inclose a copy of the letter addressed to the President, which was
approved by him and led to the detail of the Dolphin.
“Very respectfully,
* GILBERT HH. GROSVENOR.
“Lieut. Gen. ADNA R. CHAFFEE, U. S. Army.
“War Department, Washington, D.C.”

On January 20 the following letter was received from General Chaffee, stat-
ing that the military escort had been detailed :
“ JANUARY 19, 1904.
“Sra: I have just received your note of January 19, requesting an escort of
cavalry for the remains of Mr. James Smithson, the founder of the Smith-
sonian Institution, which are to arrive, as you say, on Friday or Saturday of

Myer to hold in readiness an escort of 50 men, properly officered, and an
urtillery caisson to convey the remains. In order to give further direction in
this matter to avoid delay and to insure promptness, it will be necessary for
you to advise me of the time and place the escort should be directed to report
to receive the remains. Will you please make certain that I am informed of
this matter at least twelve hours in advance?

Ata meeting of the Board of Regents held March 12, 1903, the fol-
lowing resolution was adopted:

** Resolved, That in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the
fourth Wednesday in January, regular meetings of the Board shall be
held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in December and on the
6th day of March, unless that date falls on Sunday, when the follow-
ing Monday shall be substituted.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

In accordance with, the above resolution the Board met on Decem-
ber 8, 1903, January 27, 1904, and March 7, L904.

The following is an abstract of its proceedings, which latter will be
found in the annual report of the Board to Congress:

Regular meeting of December 8, 1903.

Senator Platt and the Chancellor made statements with regard to the
new building for the National Museum, and the Secretary read a report
which showed that with the advice and consent of the Chancellor and
the chairman of the executive committee, as required by the resolution
of the Board adopted March 12, 1903, a contract had been made, under
date of May 18, 1903, with Messrs. Hornblower & Marshall, architects,
of Washington, D. C., for the necessary architectural services.

With regard to the special report of the executive committee as sub-
mitted by Doctor Bell, and the report of the special committee which was
read at length by the Chancellor, the Board, after discussion, adopted
resolutions providing for the printing of these reports and their dis-
tribution to the members of the Board.

The Secretary presented the compilation of laws which had been
prepared in accordance with a resolution offered by Senator Cockrell
at the meeting of March 12, 1903, and the manuscript was referred to
Senator Cockrell for his examination and decision as to printing.

The Secretary read letters from the Hon. William Henry Bishop,
United States consul at Genoa, Italy, and from the committee of the
British burial ground fund, explaining the urgency of action with
regard to the removal of the remains of James Smithson.

ier Bell renewed the proposition which he made at the last
meeting that the remains of Smithson be brought to this country
at his expense, and after discussion the Board adopted the following
resolutions:

* Resolved, That Dr. A. Graham Bell be appointed as a committee
to take charge of the matter of the removal of the remains of James
Smithson from Genoa to W ashington, with the request that the nego-
tiations and removal be conducted quietly and privately.

‘* Resolved, That upon the conclusion of this duty all expenses in-
volved by it be reimbursed to Doctor Bell from the funds of the
Institution.”

ANNUAL MEETING OF JANUARY 27, 1904.

The ey announced that on January 12 the Speaker of the
House had reappointed Representatives Hitt, Adams, and Dinsmore as
Regents for two years; and also that Senator Henderson and Dr. A.
Graham Bell had been reappointed’ for a term of six years by joint
resolution approved by the President January 27, 1904.

The usual resolution relative to income and expenditure was adopted,
and the Secretary presented his annual report of the operations of the
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Institution and its several dependencies for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1903.

The Board adopted the annual report of the executive committee to
the same date, showing in detail the financial condition of the Institu-
tion.

Senator Henderson, chairman of the permanent committee, made
statements in regard to the proposed bequests of Addison T. Reid and
Joseph White Sprague; also concerning the willof Wallace C. Andrews,
and the present status of the Hodgkins and Avery funds. He further
reported upon the expenditures incurred by the Secretary since the
last annual meeting, in continuing his experiments in mechanical
flight under the authority of the Board.

The Secretary made a statement concerning the publications in
preparation by the Institution and also with regard to aerodromic
experiments carried on by him.

He reported that Congress, under a clause of the sundry civil act,
approved March 3, 1903, had authorized the erection of a new build-
ing for the National Museum at a cost not to exceed $3,500,000.

He spoke of the work of the Bureau of American Ethnology and of
his efforts to place the Bureau upon a sound administrative footing.
He recalled previous efforts to secure a law for the protection of
antiquities on the public domain, and urged present action. The
Board thereupon adopted a resolution to that effect.

The Secretary reported upon the work of the International
Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astrophysical
Observatory.

‘The report of the special committee to consider the question of
defining the duties of the executive committee was submitted by the
Chancellor, but action thereupon was deferred until the meeting of
March 7.

At the evening session of this meeting Dr. A. Graham Bell sub-
mitted in full his report upon the removal of James Smithson’s
remains from Genoa to Washington, which is on file with the records
of the Board and a lengthy abstract of which will be found on page 7.

After remarks, the Board adopted the following resolutions:

* Resolved, That the Board of Regents desire to record in the min-
utes of the Institution their profound appreciation of the voluntary
service of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell in personally going to Genoa
and returning with the remains of James Smithson that they might
find a resting place in the grounds of the Institution he so nobly
founded ‘for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.’

** Resolved, That the Chanceilor and the Secretary, with the members
of the executive committee, be appointed a committee upon the ques-
tion of the final disposition of the remains of James Smithson and of

the monument to be erected to him, with power to act in the entire
matter,”
or

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
REGULAR MEETING OF MARCH 7, 1904.

The Chancellor read in “full the report of the special committee
appointed to consider the question of defining the powers of the
executive committee, which was very fully discussed and adopted.

Doctor Bell then read the special report of the executive committee
as presented by him at the meeting of December 8, 1903. After dis-
cussion the Board adopted Senator Cullom’s motion that action on the
report be indefinitely postponed.

The report of the special committee on the disposition of the remains
of James Smithson, in which it was recommended that a fitting tomb
should be erected in the grounds of the Institution and that Congress
be requested to make an adequate appropriation for it, was submitted.
After remarks the report was adopted with the understanding that the
committee was to pursue the subject still further.

The Secretary brought before the Board the matter of the will of
the late Harriet Lane Johnston, who left a number of paintings to the

Jorcoran Gallery of Art until a national gallery of art should be estab-

lished by the Government. The Corcoran Gallery had declined the
pictures under these conditions, and the Secretary had been addressed
with regard to the probability of the Government establishing such
a gallery of art under the Smithsonian Institution. The matter was
referred to the executive committee.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The Institution has been for more than half a century one of the
most important agencies in the intellectual life of the American people.
It has furnished a center for workers in every department of scientific
and educational activity, and it has been the chief agency for the free
exchange of books, apparatus of research, and of scientific intelligence
between this and other countries. Its publications, which include
more than 250 volumes, are to be found in all of the important libraries
of the world, and some of them on the work table of every scientific
investigator. Its library constitutes an important part of the Library
of Congress, and its museum is the rarest in existence in many branches
of the natural history and ethnology of the New World.

For nearly sixty years it has been in constant cooperation with the
Government, with public institutions, and with individuals in every
enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed its advice, support,
oraid. ‘The appreciation of the work of the Institution by the Ameri-
can people is best testified by their representatives in Congress. This
has been clearly demonstrated through many successive terms regard-
less of political change; by the judgment with which their representa-
tives upon the Board of Regents are selected; by the care by which
they protect the Institution in its freedom from political entangle-
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ments; by the discrimination with which the reports are distributed,
and by numerous evidences of interest and liberality.

The objects of the Institution were defined by the founder in the
broadest possible terms, and interpreted by its first Secretary, Joseph
Henry, in the words ‘‘to assist men of science in making original
researches, to publish them in a series of volumes, and to give a copy
of them to every first-class library on the face of the earth.” While
the field has been of necessity narrowed from time to time, or diverted
in first one direction and then another, the breadth of scope has never
been narrowed. That many of the efforts have grown so large as to
require either direct support of the Government by the establishment
of independent bureaus, finally coming under the direction of the
Executive Departments, or aid to agencies which continue under the
direction of the Institution, though sustained by Congressional appro-
priation, is but a further evidence of the fact that the charter of the
Institution has been adhered to both in the spirit and in the letter.
The United States Weather Bureau, the Geological Survey, the Fish
Commission, and the National Herbarium grew out of its earlier activi
ties, and the National Museum, the International Exchanges, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the Zoological Park, and the Astro-
physical Observatory are still directed by it. It led the way in the
organization of library work in the United States; it took the initial
steps and continues to support schemes for international cataloguing,
and it maintains a benevolent relation with the American Historical
Association and the National Society of the Daughters of the Ameri-
can Revolution.

Sixty years ago it was relatively the best endowed scientific institu-
tion in the United States and one of two or three of national scope.
The magnificent endowments in this time of so many universities and
colleges have changed this relationship to one of pecuniary inferiority,
yet without changing the nature of the Institution’s relations to these.
To the organizations aiding in the scientific advancement of the
country, which advancement has in large measure contributed to the
material welfare of the United States, the interests benefited thereby
have in return made large endowments for original research either
through the great universities and societies of the land or by the
establishment of new academies, institutions, and museums. ‘To all
of these the Smithsonian Institution holds out a friendly cooperation,
its aim being, while continuing its own work upon its accepted lines
and adapting them to new needs as occasion arises, to continue along
the established policy of preventing rivalries, promoting wise cooper-
ation, diminishing waste, and furthering the search for knowledge,
the recording of discovered truth, and its dissemination among the
people.

It must at no time be forgotten, however, that the Institution, of
which the Government is trustee, was not limited either by the founder
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

or by Congress to the people of the United States, but was designed
for allmen. The spreading abroad of the work done by scientific men
in this country, the bringing to the knowledge of our own workers
the researches of men of other lands, the aiding in international con-
eresses which take place from time to time in various countries, the
promotion, in short, of friendly relations and useful cooperation
among’ scientific men the world over, and the advice and support to
our Government in such relations wherever possible, may be counted
in no small measure among the important works which the Institution
is carrying on.

THE REMOVAL OF THE REMAINS OF JAMES SMITHSON.

The remains of James Smithson, founder of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, who died June 27, 1829, at Genoa, Italy, were deposited in the
little cemetery belonging to the English church, on the heights of San
Benigno, a solitary spot planted with cypress trees, and looking down
upon the Gulf of Genoa. In 1891 the Secretary of the Institution
visited the grave, and, with the approval of the regents, deposited with
the secretary of the English church fund a small sum to invest in Italian
5 per cent rents, for its perpetual care. It was visited on two later
occasions by the Secretary, who placed a bronze tablet containing a
bas-relief of Smithson, in the English church, and one also at the
tomb, whence it was subsequently stolen.

In previous reports mention has been made of the suggested removal
of the remains of Mr. Smithson to America, in view of the probability
that before many years the site of the cemetery might be required by
the Italian authorities. In accordance with the resolution of the
Regents adopted December 8, 1903 (see p. 3), appointing him a com-
mittee to take charge of the removal of the the remains from Genoa
to Washington, Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, accompanied by Mrs.
Bell, sailed on the 15th of December for the port of Cherbourg in
France, and going thence to Genoa, commenced at once the arrange-
ments for the transfer of the remains, arrangements which would have
occupied a quite indefinite time and incurred a corresponding delay
except for the aid given by the United States consul, Mr. William
Henry Bishop, which Dr. Bell gladly acknowledges.

On opening the tomb in the presence of Dr. Bell, the United States
consul, Noel Lees, esq. (official representative of the British Burial
Ground Fund Association), and other witnesses, it was found that the
remains of Smithson, represented by the skeleton, were in fair preser-
ration, although the wooden coffin in which they had been ineclosed
had molded away. ‘The remains were placed in a metal casket and
deposited in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery, where they rested
until January 2, when the casket was inclosed in a coflin of strong

“

wood and covered with the American flag by Consul Bishop. On this

occasion Doctor Bell, Mr. Bishop, and the other witnesses again
assembled and the following remarks were made:

REMARKS BY WILLIAM HENRY BISHOP, ESQ., UNITED STATES CONSUL.

Dr. ALEXANDER GRAHAM Bei: You arrived here, my dear Dr. Graham Bell,
charged by the Smithsonian Institution with the mission of removing to Washington
the remains of the founder of that Institution, James Smithson, who has been buried
till now in the cemetery where we stand since his death at Genoa in the year 1829.
Having been invited by you and by the Smithsonian Institution to aid you, to what
extent I might be able, in this object, it has been a matter of great pride and pleas-
ure to me that I have been allowed to do so.

All the steps necessary to such removal have now been taken. We have received
the authorization of the governmental heads of the province, the city, and the British
Burial Ground Fund, in which latter'the title to the cemetery and the custody of the
grave of James Smithson are vested, and all of these have kindly cooperated with us
in the work.

The body of James Smithson has now been reverently raised from the earth; it
has been placed in a case securely sealed, and this case stands ready to pass into the
charge of the Steamship company which will convey it to New York.

I assure you that it is with a feeling of real emotion that I have just now cast the
American flag over the body of this illustrious man, this noble but as yet little
known benefactor, as it is on the verge of beginning its journey to the United States.
The flag adopts him already, as it were, in the substance, for our country, to which
he has so long belonged in the spirit. He is now about to receive there a portion of
the outward veneration and homage he so supremely merits, and which, owing to
the modest circumstances of his life, and his interment here in some sense almost
forgotten, he has never had.

Shall I admit that on taking possession of my post as consul at Genoa I did not
even know who James Smithson was? I may say that I was surprised to learn that
he was buried at Genoa; more surprised still that he was an Englishman, who had
never even set foot in America. He left his great bequest to the United States, then
in its infancy, through admiring confidence in our future. It is likely that many, or
even most, Americans are in the same condition as was I myself; for occasion has
rarely arisen for taking thought as to the personality of the man. Happily this unen-
lightened condition of mind is about to cease.

Dr. Graham Bell, I wish you a hearty God-speed across the ocean with your
precious freight. The American people will receive it with general gratification,
and, through the Smithsonian Institution, will soon delight to pay it great honor.

RESPONSE BY DR. ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL.

Mr. Consut: It is with feelings of deep emotion that I undertake the transporta-
tion of the remains of James Smithson from the cemetery where they have so long
reposed to their last resting place in the United States.

On behalf of the Smithsonian Institution allow me to thank you, Mr. Consul, for
the unwearied zeal and care with which you haye given me your assistance. With-
out your active cooperation and without your personal sympathy it would have been
difficult, indeed, for me to have accomplished the object of my mission here.

On behalf of the Smithsonian Institution I beg to thank you, too, Mr. Noel Lees,
for your courtesy and attention, and trust that you will convey to His British
Majesty’s consul-general and to the committee of the British Burial Ground Fund
my thanks, and the thanks of the Institution I represent, for their ready assistance
in furthering my mission.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. )

The United States of America will provide, in Washington, D. C., a suitable and
permanent resting place for the remains of her great benefactor, James Smithson,
through the instrumentality of the Smithsonian Institution, the establishment
created by the Government to perpetuate his name.

REMARKS BY NOEL LEES, ESQ.

Dr. GranamM Bett: I beg to thank you heartily for the words you have said with
regard to the aid you have received from the burial board and myself. Although
we regret to lose the remains of James Smithson, we at the same time feel that in the
country to which he left his money, with such charitable intent, his remains will
receive the honor and glory which have so long been due to them, and we must
understand that our loss is America’s gain. To us it will always remain a pleasant
memory that, from the date of his burial to the present day, we have had in our cus-
tody in this picturesque little churchyard, the remains of a man whose foresight and
kindness have enabled so many in the New World to benetit.

On the conclusion of these remarks the remains were placed on
board the steamer Princess Irene, of the North German Lloyd Com-
pany, which brought them to America in the personal charge of Dr.
Bell, the vessel reaching New York on the morning of January 20,
By direction of the President of the United States, the U.S. S. Dol-
phin met the Princess [rene in the lower bay and escorted her up the
harbor.

In the presence of Dr. Bell and the Secretary of the Institution, the
remains were transferred to a naval tug and conveyed to the Dolphin,
and in the continued charge of Dr. Bell were brought to Washington,
arriving at the Navy-Yard on Saturday, January 23.

On Monday the 25th the remains were transported by the naval
authorities, with suitable ceremonies, to the navy-yard gate, where
they were taken in charge by a cavalry escort furnished by the War
Department, and, accompanied by Assistant Secretary of State Loomis,
representing the President, by the British ambassador, the Regents
and the Secretary of the Institution, and the president of the Board of
Commissioners of the District of Columbia, they were conveyed to
the Smithsonian Institution, where the coftin, draped in the American
and. British flags, was deposited in the center of the main hall of the
building.

Dr. Bell, addressing Senator Frye in behalf of the Regents, said:

Mr. Senator: I have the honor to hand over to the Smithsonian Institution the
mortal remains of its founder, James Smithson, a Fellow of the Royal Society of
London, England, who died in Genoa, Italy, on the 27th of June, 1829.

For nearly seventy-five years the body of Smithson has reposed in an almost for-
gotten grave in the picturesque little British cemetery on the heights of San Beningo,
in Genoa. City improvements have led to the expropriation of this cemetery and
removal of the remains, and at the last meeting of the board of regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution I was appointed a committee to arrange for the transfer of the
remains of Smithson to this country. On my arrival in Genoa every facility was
afforded me for the accomplishment of my mission by the provincial and municipal
authorities, by His British Majesty’s consul-general, Mr. Keene; by the committee
of the British Burial Fund Association, in which is vested the ownership of the
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cemetery, as well as by our own consul, Mr. William Henry Bishop, to whom I am
much indebted for his yalued services.

On the 31st of December, 1903, the tomb of Smithson was opened in my presence,
as the representative of the Smithsonian Institution, and in the presence of the
American consul and six other witnesses. The remains of Smithson were reverently
raised from the grave and placed in a metallic casket, over which the consul of the
United States cast the American flag, while the witnesses stood around with uncov-
ered heads. The casket was then left in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery,
securely sealed and under guard, until the 2d of January, when it was placed in a
coffin of strong wood, as demanded by Italian law, and was then transported to the
North German Lloyd steamship Princess Irene, accompanied by the American consul
and myself.

The steamer sailed from Genoa on the 7th of January, and upon arrival in the
United States, the remains of Smithson were received with national honors by diree-
tion of the President, and of the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of War.

The remains were brought to Washington on board the U. 8. dispatch boat Dol-
phin, and have been escorted to the Smithsonian Institution by United States cavalry.

And now, Mr. Senator, my mission is ended, and I deliver into your hands, as the
representative of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, the remains
of this great benefactor of the United States.

Senator Frye replied:

Sir: The Smithsonian Institution receives with profound gratitude the remains of
its distinguished founder. Providence, every now and then, seems to place in the
world a man and inspires him with a purpose to elevate his fellow men. Such a
man was Mr. Smithson, the founder of this Institution. The spirit, sir, which
prompted you to such earnest endeavor, resulting as it did in taking these remains
from their resting place in a country foreign to him and foreign to us, and bringing
them here where for so many years we have enjoyed the rich fruits of his splendid
benefaction, your countrymen will appreciate. His grave here will be an incentive
to earnest, faithful, wise, and discreet endeavor to carry. out his lofty purposes, and,
sir, it will be to our people a sacred spot while the Republie endures.

The brief but impressive ceremonies of the occasion concluded with
the following prayer, offered by the Rev. Dr. Randolph H. McKim:

Almighty God, eternal source of light and truth, by whose wise providence all
things in heaven and earth are governed, we give thee thanks that thou didst put
into the heart of thy servant whose dust we receive with reverence here to-day, to
lay the foundation of this school of science, and we pray thee that it may more and
more be instrumental in the true interpretation of the laws of nature, and in unveil-
ing to the mind of man the glory of God in the work of his hands, to the end that
for all the generations to come this Institution may bea beacon light of truth and of
progress, to the glory of God and to the good of mankind. All this we beg through
Him by whom all things were made, Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

The remains rest temporarily in a room which contains the few per-
sonal relics of Smithson, until their final disposal by the Regents.

ADMINISTRATION.

In view of the ever-increasing responsibilities imposed upon the
Institution, both by the administration of its own fund and the several
dependencies placed by Congress under its direction, a system has
been from year to year carefully worked out, which, while retaining
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

in a central office under the Secretary’s supervision, the general plan
of the whole Institution, has rendered it practicable to leave the carry-
ing out of details to those in immediate charge of the work of the
bureaus. I record with gratitude the ever-increasing aid rendered me
by the Regents, as evidenced not only through the increased amount
of time given to the policy of the Institution, but by their advice and
help in all matters, whether of policy or administration, in which their
aid has been sought.
BUILDINGS.

The ceiling of the large anthropological hall in the main Smithsonian
building has been practically reconstructed and the hall has been
painted and decorated anew. There has thus been practically made
available for use the largest single exhibition hall in the building, and
it is expected that the valuable archeological collections of the Institu-
tion will be seen to better advantage than ever before. It is to be
regretted that the uncomfortable tread of the steps and the absence of
an elevator may deter many persons from visiting this very attractive
room.

The repairs to the roof of the main Smithsonian building have been
completed, and much-needed repairs were also made to the roof of the
Museum building.

The above fund is deposited in the Treasury of the United States
and bears interest at 6 per cent per annum under the provisions of the
act organizing the Institution and act of Congress approved March 12,
1894. In addition to the permanent fund, the Regents hold certain
approved railroad bonds which form part of the fund established by
Mr. Hodgkins for investigations into the properties of atmospheric air.

At the beginning. of the fiscal year, July 1, 1903, the balance, as
stated in my last report, was $55,507.67. During the year the total
receipts by the Institution were $68,435.56. Of this sum, $57,754.17
was derived from the interest and the remaining $10,681.39 was
received from,miscellaneous sources.
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The disbursements during the year amounted to $77,294.90, the
details of which are given in the report of the executive committee.
The balance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1904,
for the expenses of the Institution was $46,648.33. A considerable
part of this balance is held against certain contingent obligations which
may be expected to mature as a result of various scientific investiga-
tions and publications in progress.

During the fiscal year 1904, the Institution was charged by Con-
gress with the disbursement of the following appropriations:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. io

, RESEARCH.

It was a part of the original plan of the Institution that its Secretary
should not give his time wholly to administrative duties, but should
directly aid in its scientific investigations.

Research work in various fields of science has been continued by the
Institution and its dependencies.

I have made some progress toward the solution of the problem of
mechanical flight, and have been carrying on, with the consent of the
Regents, some experiments for the War Department, at its expense,
and have added other experiments, partly at the expense of the
Institution. Owing to an accident to the launching apparatus it was
not possible to make a satisfactory test of the srodrome, and the
exhaustion of available funds has compelled the abandonment, at least
temporarily, of the experiments.

In the Astrophysical Observatory I have continued work believed
to be important, and inaugurated some experiments of novel interest,
which are referred to later.

Through the Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology the
Institution has been enabled to carry on various biological, geological,
and ethnological researches, which will be found fully described else-
where in this report and need not be repeated here.

HODGKINS FUND.

Series of experiments conducted with the aid of grants from the
Hodgkins fund of the Institution are still in progress. Among those
sufficiently advanced to permit publication, the investigations of Dr.
Carl Barus may be mentioned. two memoirs detailing the earlier
results of these experiments have already been issued in the Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge, and a third report is now
awaited, which will record experiments on the ionization and nuclea-
tion of air in contact with phosphorus and with water nuclei. Other
interesting data in regard to the diffusion of vapor into nucleated air,
periodic color distribution in coronas, ete., will be given in this
memoir, which will probably be issued during the present year.

Dr. E. W. Scripture, of Yale University, to whom a grant was
awarded for the construction of a ‘* vowel organ,” has been prosecut-
ing his researches for the last year in Berlin. He reports numerous
interesting experiments in the construction of resonators of various
materials with which he has succeeded in producing the different vowel

« Resolved, That the Secretary continue his researches in physical science, and pre-

sent such facts and principles as may be developed for publication in the Smithsonian
contributions. (Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents January 26, 1847. )

sounds. Doctor Scripture says the problem now before him is to
replace the material used in the artificial glottis he has constructed, by
a substance which can be more perfectly adapted to his purpose in some
essentials than any he has hitherto availed himself of. When this
object is attained, he expects to be able to construct an organ which
can sing the vowels, or a vowel register which, attached to a pipe
organ, may be effectively used in church music.

The memoir of Dr. Victor Schumann, of Leipzig, on the ‘* Absorp-
tion and Emission of the Gases of Atmospheric Air in the Ultra- Violet
Spectrum,” mentioned in my last report as in course of publication,
has now been issued in Volume XXIX of the Smithsonian Contribu-
tions to Knowledge. The special apparatus, devised and constructed
by the author, is shown by plates in the memoir, and the method of
using it described. Although Doctor Schumann considers this investi-
gation but preliminary to further research in this region of the spec-
trum, specialists recognize that a notable step in advance has been
made by the persevering and able work described in this memoir.

Photographs of the apparatus used by Prof. William Hallock in his
Hodgkins research on the composition of vowel sounds, together with
the curves drawn by the synthetic analyzer, have been submitted with
a detailed description of the same. Although unexpected difficulties
have been encountered in transferring the records to the magnetic
wire, the investigation is reported as progressing, on the whole, satis-
factorily, and sound records, secured by means of the complicated and
ingenious apparatus made use of, are to be submitted.

A memoir summarizing the research of Dr. M. W. Travers, ‘‘On
the Attainment of Very Low Temperatures,” has now been issued as
No. 1441 of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. The investi-
gations of Doctor Travers, who has recently been appointed to the
chair of chemistry in University College, Bristol, England, which have
been temporarily suspended while awaiting the reconstruction of some
parts of the apparatus essential to the investigation, are soon to be
resumed, when further progress will be reported to the Institution.

Dr. R. von Lendenfeld, of the University of Prague, who was aided
in 1900 by a grant from the Hodgkins fund for a study of the motion
of birds in actual free flight, has recently submitted a paper on the
structure of bird’s wing feathers, written by Dr. E. Mascha, with
the aid and under the supervision of Doctor von Lendenfeld. This
paper, which treats of the morphology and physiology of flight feath-
ers (vemiges), studied microscopically, is of interest in connection with
the Hodgkins research of Doctor von Lendenfeld, which I have men-
tioned in former reports.

The subscription of the Institution to the Journal of Terrestrial
Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity has been again continued, the
copies thus secured being distributed, as before, to domestic and for-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

eign libraries and establishments especially interested in the subjects
treated of by the journal. -

A grant has been approyed on behalf of Dr. A. F. Zahm, professor
of physical science in the Catholic University of America, in Wash-
ington City, for a series of experiments: on the laws of atmospheric
resistance to moving bodies. This research, which is still in progress,
will be reported on later.

The experiments of Mr. Alexander Larsen, of Chicago, on lightning
flashes and fluorescence, carried on by means of simple mechanism
adapted and arranged by himself, have been aided by a moderate grant
from the Hodgkins fund. These experiments, which are now in prog-
ress, are expected to yield results of scientific value.

In view of the numerous inquiries received from investigators and
specialists, it may be again stated that the Hodgkins prize competition
of the Institution was definitely closed December 31, 1894, and that no
further competition on any subject is at present proposed by the Insti-
tution. A recent circular stating the conditions which, in accordance
with the will of the donor, govern the administration of the Hodgkins
fund, including also a mention of the Hodgkins medal, which may be
awarded for important contributions to our knowledge of the nature
and properties of atmospheric air, and stating the conditions g@overn-
ing the award of grants which are occasionally approved, is sent to
those requesting it. A brief history of the Hodgkins foundation, not-
ing the medals and prizes awarded, and mentioning the investigations
which have been furthered by the fund, has been published in the
Quarterly Issue of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

NAPLES TABLE.

The question of the renewal of the lease of a table in the Naples
Zoological Station, which was held under advisement for some months,
was finally decided in the affirmative, and the contract renewed on
behalf of the Institution for three years from January 1, 1904.

Since this action, applications for the seat have been received, and
that of Prof. J. B. Johnston, head of the Department of Zoology in
the University of West Virginia, which had been submitted a second
time, in compliance with the rule of action observed in the interest of
all candidates, was approved for six months from September 1, 1904.
Doctor Johnston is the author of several important papers on the com-
parative anatomy of the brain and cranial nerves of the lower verte-
brates, and his session will afford undoubted advantages for his study
of the problems of vertebrate morphology and the evolution of the
nervous system.

The additions to the buildings at the Naples Station now in progress
‘will ada much to the space available for research, and this, together
with the larger number of tables now supported by scientific institu-

tions in the United States, will tend to obviate the not infrequent
application by several students at the same time for the Smithsonian
seat, a matter of regret, as In such a case some applicants must be dis-
appointed, since an excess of workers at the same table is a source of
inconvenience to Doctor Dohrn, the courteous director of the Station.
It is, however, desired in the interest of science that the Smithsonian
table should be continuously occupied during the months available for
study at Naples, and all applications for the seat receive immediate
consideration. A brief account of the administration of the Smithso-
nian table in the Naples Station, embodying the data which is likely to
be of use to applicants, has recently been published in the Quarterly
Issue of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

It is a pleasure to state that the advisory committee remains
unchanged, and to express thanks for the helpful attention given to
all questions referred to the committee for consideration.

EXPLORATIONS.

The Institution has this year made explorations through its private
funds, such as the Alaskan mammoth expedition, and that to the
Canadian glaciers, mentioned below, in addition to the customary
biological, geological, and ethnological ones through the National
Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology.

Alaskan mammoth expedition.—About the middle of May the Insti-
tution dispatched an expedition to Alaska under the direction of Mr.
A.G. Maddren. The most important work sought to be accomplished
is the collecting of remains of the mammoth and other large mammals,
which have been reported as abundant in various regions, one place
being known as the ‘*‘ Bone Yard,” another as Elephant Point, along
the south shore of Kotzebue Sound.

Exploration of Canadian glaciers.—An exploration of some of the
glaciers of British Columbia has been undertaken by Dr. W. H.
Sherzer, of Michigan, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, for the purpose of gathering definite information regarding
glacial phenomena, such as the nature and cause of the ice flow, the
temperature of the ice at various depths, and its relation to air tem-
peratures, the amount of surface melting, and the possible transfer-
ence of material from the surface to lower portions. The special
field of study will be the five most accessible glaciers along the line of
the Canadian Pacific Railway, including the Victoria glacier at Lake
Louise, the Wapta glacier in the Joho Valley, and the Asulkan, and
Illecillewalt glaciers near Glacier House.

PUBLICATIONS.

The Institution distributed during the year a total of 45,705 vol-
umes or parts of volumes of the series of Smithsonian Contributions,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. We

Miscellaneous Collections, Reports and publications not included in
the regular series.) L

In the publications of the Institution the double aim of its founder is
represented, in that it should exist both for the ‘‘increase” and the
‘diffusion’ of knowledge.

The recording of results of original researches, the *‘ increase” of
knowledge, is chiefly through the Contribution to Knowledge, a quarto
series begun in 1848, and in which 145 memoirs, collected in 33 vol-
umes, have so far been published.

Three memoirs have been added to this series, one on the moon, one
on reflecting telescopes, and one on whalebone whales.

The moon memoir, by Prof. N.S. Shaler, entitled **A Comparison
‘of the Features of the Earth and Moon,” is a work of 79 pages of text,
with 25 full page illustrations, each of them accompanied by a descrip-
tion of the principal objects shown.

As stated in my last report, I have for more than twelve years past
been preparing the material for the publication of a work, on the part
of the Smithsonian Institution, which it was hoped would consist essen-
tially of photographic views of the moon, so complete and, it was
expected (with the advance of photography), so minute, that the fea-
tures of our satellite might be studied in them by the geologists and
the selenographer, nearly as well as by the astronomer at the telescope.
This hope has only been partially fulfilled, for photography, which
has made such eminent advances in the reproduction of nebule and
like celestial features, has indeed progressed in lunar work, but not to
the same extent asin other fields. The expectation that such a com-
plete work could be advantageously published for this purpose has,
then, been laid aside for the present.

It was decided to draw from the material prepared for this larger
work, some photographs taken at the Lick Observatory and_ the
Paris Observatory, and particularly some recently obtained by Pro-
fessor Ritchey at the Yerkes Observatory, for which I have to express
the thanks of the Institution. These illustrations are attached to the
present paper by Professor Shaler, and may, then, be considered to be
a separate contribution by the Institution to the study of selenography.

Professor Shaler’s memoir gives the results of personal studies car-
ried on for a third of a century. He has devoted about one hundred
nights to telescopic study of the moon with the Mertz equatorial of
Harvard College Observatory, his later researches having been chiefly
by means of photographs at Harvard University, with which he has so
Jong been connected.

A memoir of 106 pages, with 13 full-page illustrations and many
text figures, consists of a reprint of a work by Professor Draper on

the construction of a silvered glass telescope, accompanied by a paper
by Prof. G. W. Ritchey on the modern reflecting telescope and the
making and testing of optical mirrors.

For few papers published by the institution has there been a more
constant demand than for this memoir by Prof. Henry Draper, entitled
‘*On the Construction of a Silvered Glass Telescope,” originally issued
forty years ago, in 1864. The paper is of remarkable merit as a sum-
mary of, and an addition to, the knowledge existing at the time, but
during the long interval which has elapsed, progress has been made
in various directions and by various hands. On the occasion of a new
edition of this classic memoir, it was sought to give an account of the
latest knowledge on the subject, and I was gratified to be able to obtain
from Mr. Ritchey, whose labors in this direction are so well known,
an account of the processes which he has employed for making the
great mirrors that have been so effective at the Yerkes Observatory,
and it has been decided to republish, with the original Draper memoir,
but as an entirely independent contribution to the subject, the present
article by Mr. Ritchey. The great refracting instruments which have
been produced in recent years have not superseded the use of the
reflector, which, on the contrary, is occupying a more and more impor-
tant place. The reader is here presented with the most recent methods
and results needed in the construction of great mirrors for modern
reflecting telescopes.

The work on whales is by Dr. Frederick W. True, head curator of
Biology in the National Museum, and treats in an exhaustive manner
of the whalebone whales of the western North Atlantic compared with
those occurring in European waters, with some observations on the
species of the North Pacific. It makes a volume of 337 pages, with
50 full-page illustrations and 97 text figures.

Doctor True has here brought together extensive original data rela-
tive to the external and osteological characters of the large whales of
the western North Atlantic, for the purpose of determining whether the
species are the same on both sides of that ocean. The facts have been
derived from a study of fresh specimens at the Newfoundland whaling
stations, the collection of the United States National Museum, and the
skeletons in other large museums of the United States. Special study
was given to the type specimens of American species proposed by
Prof. E. D. Cope and Capt. C. M. Scammon, all of which, with one
exception, were examined by the author.

The investigation is preparatory to a study of the geographical dis-
tribution and migrations of the larger cetaceans in the North Atlantic,
which could not be undertaken until the identity of the species them-
selves was determined. Numerous facts, however, relating to the
occurrence of whales at different points off the coasts of North
America and the seasons of their appearance and disappearance, have
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ee

been assembled. The results of the investigation show that several
American species which have been proposed are quite certainly nomi-
nal, and that, as a wholé, the species of the Atlantic coast of North
America can not be distinguished from those of European waters.
Some attention has been paid to the whales of the North Pacific. The
information previously recorded has been brought together in orderly
sequence and yarious new facts added, but the amount of material at
present available is insufficient to serve as a basis for discrimination
of closely allied species. It is certain, however, that the whales of
the North Pacific, with one exception, bear an extremely close resem-
blance to those of the North Atlantic. The California Gray whale,
Rhachianectes glaueus, has no counterpart in the Atlantic. One well
known European species, the Pollack whale, Balenopiera borealis, not
previously known in North American waters, was observed at the New-
foundland whaling stations while this volume was passing through the
press. The illustrations include views of the type specimens of the
species proposed by Cope and Scammon; also numerous representa-
tions of the different individuals of the Common Finback and the
Sulphurbottom, from photographs taken by the author at the New-
foundland whaling stations. The latter are of special value for the
study of individual variation in these huge animals.

The series of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections is intended to
include all the publications issued directly by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in octavo form, excepting the Annual Report, which is a Con-
gressional document. In the Collections are included reports on the
present state of our knowledge of particular branches of science;
instructions for collecting and digesting facts and materials for
research; lists and synopses of species of the organic and inorganic
world; Museum catalogues; reports of explorations; aids to biblio-
graphical investigations, etc., generally prepared at the express request

of the Institution and at its expense.
A NEW QUARTERLY ISSUE.

Since 1862, when the series of Miscellaneous Collections was begun,
there have been published +45 volumes, made up of several hundred
individual papers.

In order to afford a medium for the early publication of the results
of researches conducted by the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus,
and especially for the publication of reports of a preliminary nature,
I have decided during the past year to establish a quarterly issue of
the Miscellaneous Collections, which shall not supersede the regular
series, but be a part of it. Each number of the quarterly is planned
to consist of about 144 pages of text and to be suitably illustrated.
The first volume has been completed, and makes a book of 463 pages,

.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

including 28 papers, with 103 plates and 45 text figures, as enumerated
by the editor in the appendix to this report.

To the regular series of Miscellaneous Collections the following
papers have been added:

The Literature of Thorium, by Dr. Cavalier H. Joiiet; Phylogeny of
Fusus and its Allies, by Prof. A. W. Grabau; Researches on the
Attainment of Very Low Temperatures, by Prof. Morris W. Travers,
and a Select Bibliography of Chemistry (Second Supplement), by Dr.
H. C. Bolton.¢

There was in press at the close of the year a Catalogue of Diptera,
by Prof. J. M. Aldrich, and Researches in Helminthology and Parasit-
ology, by Dr. Joseph Leidy.

The Smithsonian Report is printed as a Congressional document and
is its only publication of which the edition is large enough to permit
even a limited distribution to individuals. In the general appendix to
the report it has been my especial aim to include, as heretofore, papers
of scientific importance, treated in a way to be understood by the lay
student. The Report for 1903 has been put in type, but had not been
delivered by the printer at the close of the fiscal year. The volume
contains the Secretary’s report to the Regents for the year ending
June 30, 1903, the proceedings of the Regents’ meeting of January 28,
1903, and the report of the Executive Committee dated January 25,
1904, besides the general appendix of about 50 papers on scientific
subjects relating chiefly to the calendar year 1903.

Among the many manuscripts left unfinished by the late Dr. G.
Brown Goode, there is a group of chapters dealing with the progress
of science in America. In accordance with the author’s liberal inter-
pretation of the meaning of science, the work does not confine itself
to the physical and natural sciences, but contains notes on anthropology,
philology, bibliography, and kindred subjects. As Doctor Goode was
eminently the historian of American science, it seems especially fitting
that the Smithsonian Institution should undertake the publication of
these memoirs, even if incomplete. The manuscript is now being
worked over and I hope that in the near future these notes will in
book form serve as a foundation for and a stimulus to further work in
the same direction.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Con
cress during the year aggregated 2,286 volumes, 21,467 parts of vol-
umes and pamphlets, and 215 charts, making a total of 23,968 cata-
logue entries, equivalent to nearly 15,000 octavo volumes. Additions

aggregating 7,893 entries have been made to the libraries of the Secre-
tary. Office, Astrophysical Observatory, the National Zoological
Park, and the National Museum. In the Museum library there are
now 20,548 bound volumes and 35,950 unbound papers.

General de Peyster continues to add many valuable volumes to the
Watts de Peyster Collection Napoléon Buonaparte, and there have also
been received from him several oil paintings, and many historical
relics of the American colonial period.

International Cataloque of Scientific Literature.—The Institution
has continued the work of indexing scientific publications, the total
number of references sent to the central bureau at London during the
year aggregating 21,213, or an increase of 50 per cent over the pre-
vious year, which was made possible by an addition to the allotment
from the Smithsonian fund for this work. The first annual issue of
the catalogue has now been published and distributed, and also several
volumes of the second annual issue.

CORRESPONDENCE.

As in former years, a great many inquiries on almost every known
subject have been received by the Institution, and although many of
these did not relate directly to its operations, it has, in accordance with
the purpose of its foundation—* the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge ”—cheerfully furnished the information, as far as practicable, in
each case, notwithstanding the fact that this frequently required the
expenditure of considerable time by the members of its staff.

All correspondence in any way affecting the policy of the Institution
or its bureaus has, as heretofore, received the Secretary’s personal
attention, while letters relating to the work of the National Museum,
the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the National Zoological Park,
not included in the above class, have been acted on directly by the
Assistant Secretary in charge of the Museum, the Chief of the Bureau,
and the Superintendent of the park.

During the year many plans and descriptions of devices of various
kinds have been submitted to the Institution for an expression of opin-
ion as to their merits. These requests the Secretary has been compelled
to decline by reason of the decision of the Board of Regents, made
during the early years of the Institution, which prohibits him from
expressing an opinion upon the merits of any patentable invention.

No important changes have been made in the system of conducting
correspondence, which was inaugurated in 1890, and which has con-
tinued to be found an effective means of preventing any unnecessary
delay in its dispatch.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

INTERNATIONAL AMERICAN ARCHZOLOGICAL COMMISSION.

At the Second International Conference of the American Republics,
held in the City of Mexico on January 29, 1902, a resolution was
adopted recommending that an—

‘* International American Archeological Commission be formed through
the appointment by the President of each of the American Republics

of one or more members of such commission; * * * that the first
meeting for the organization of the commission, the election of officers,
and adoption of rules shall occur in the city of Washinetons, 27
within two years from this date; that the commission shall have power
to appoint subcommissions, w hich shall be charged specially with the
explorations or other work ‘committed to its care; that subcommissions
may be appointed which shall cause the cleaning and preservation of
the ruins of the pr incipal prehistoric cities, establishing at each of them
a museum to contain objects of interest found in the locality, and, at
such exhumed cities, to establish conveniences for the visiting public;
that the commission endeavor to establish an American International
Museum which is to become the center of all the investigations and inter-
pretations, and that it be established in the city selected by the majority
of the Republics acquiescing in this recommendation.” * *

The attention of the Smithsonian Institution was called to this pro-
posed commission through a letter from the secretary of the confer-
ence, dated May 26, 1902, asking for suggestions as to the best
Eetiede to be pursued to bring about the early establishment of the
commission and its effective organization.

A preliminary meeting of representatives appointed by some of the
Republics to consider the proposed commission was held at the
Department of State on April 15, 1903, and adjourned to the third
Monday of December.

On May 15, 1903, the Secretary of State submitted to me for con-
sideration, ol an expression of views thereon, a proposed plan of
organization of the commission.

On December 21, 1903, a meeting of the diplomatic representatives
of the American Republics was held at the Department of State in the
interest of the organization of the International Archeological Com-
mission, when representatives of the Smithsonian Institution were
invited to state to those present the position of the Institution in
regard to the work of the proposed commission, and to submit such
views in writing, to be printed in the proceedings of the meeting, for
the information of the several Republics, and adjournment was had
until the third Monday in December, 1904.

On February 16, 1904, in response to a request from the Secretary
of State, the following letter was submitted:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, U. S. A., February 16, 1904.

Sir: In reply to the communication of the Department of the 8th instant, request-

ing the presentation of ‘‘the formal views and constructive criticisms of the Smith-

submitted to the diplomatic representatives of the American Republics,’’ I have the
honor to say that no copy of the. proceedings of that meeting has been laid before
me. I understand that a project Was submitted at a previous meeting, and that
practically no action was taken at the last meeting alluded to. I have, in accordance
with the request of the Department, caused the accompanying memorandum to be
prepared. I beg at the same time to refer you to my previous letter to the Depart-
nent, of December 12.

{Inclosure.]

MEMORANDUM CONCERNING THE PROPOSED COOPERATION AMONG THE AMERICAN REPUB-
LICS FOR THE PROMOTION OF ARCHEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH.

The Smithsonian Institution strongly favors international cooperation in the
furthering of scientific work. It initiated and is at present engaged in the interna-
tional exchange of scientific publications, having agencies throughout the world,
besides acting on behalf of the United States Government for the exchange of public
documents. It is also acting as the representative of the United States in the
compilation of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature.

There is especial force in such cooperation among the American Republics for the
promotion of archeological and ethnological research, and, for that matter, among
all the countries upon the American continent and the adjacent islands, since the
problems, so far as they relate to the aboriginal populations, are not defined by
present political boundaries. British, Dutch, French, or other foreign possessions
on the American continent or in the West Indies could with advantage be included
in the project.

This cooperation can be best furthered in the first instance by the stimulation of
the organizations already in existence for these studies in the yarious countries. The
work is in almost all of the American countries carried on at present by the national
museums. In the United States it is carried on by the National Museum and the
Bureau of American Ethnology. Wherever such exist it is desirable that they should
have the opportunity of an exchange of views and the comparison of work to be
undertaken in order that the great problem, which can only be solved by coordina-
tion of research, shall be taken up with the greatest efficiency and economy. An
organization of the heads of museums and scientific government bureaus haying to
do with archeology or ethnology could be effeeted through the Bureau of American
Republics, an existing organization.

To further stimulate archeological work each American Republic or other State
willing to adhere to the scheme might undertake to secure the passage of laws
declaring archeeological and historical objects of unusual interest reserved, and that
excavations thereon should be undertaken only by properly organized museums and
all waste of archeeological objects should be prevented.

The director of the national museum in each country, the head of a bureau or
department devoted to the study of archzeology and ethnology, or, where there are
none such, some other official duly appointed, should, in executing the law for the
protection of antiquities, have a recording officer who should secure a list of all
objects taken from the ground.

The passage of laws prohibiting the manufacture of spurious antiguities is also
desirable. Such laws, being national laws, would necessarily be executed by
national authorities, and each republic or other country or province would be
autonomous in this respect.

.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

An archeeological survey of America, undertaken by the various States systematic-
ally, and upon a well-defined plan, would render an important service to the progress
of archeological science, and is a preliminary to systematic research.

Whenever a museum or scientific establishment exists now undertaking archeo-
logical and ethnological work this should remain the representation of the specific
country for such work. The interchange of duplicates among American museums,
which is already being carried on to a considerable extent, should be continued and
increased, in order that each American national museum should finally have as good a
series as is obtainable of all American archzelogical objects of interest. Care should be
taken, however, not to let this idea interfere in the proper exchange of specimens
between museums on this continent and elsewhere, since most museums, while sup-
ported by nations, are really international in character, and it is to the interest of
American museums that they shall exchange American material for foreign material,
as it is to the interest of foreign museums that they shall have material representing
American archeology. It is only by securing archzeological and ethnological series
from all countries that comparative studies can be successfully entered upon.

While uniformity is not sought, the American museums should exchange with each
other plans of cases, information with regard to methods of installation and kinds of
labels, and regulations concerning the preservation of type specimens, and the lend-
ing of specimens from one museum to the other for study or other purposes, in order
that each national museum may have all methods before it to assist in adopting such
as are best suited to its own peculiar needs.

The existence of a unique object, manuscript, or codex, without its reproduction
by cast, photograph, or other mechanical means, renders it possible in the event of
fire or other disaster that all the knowledge represented by these objects will be lost
to the world. The copying by mechanical. means of such specimens and their
exchange among the various countries is suggested as one of the most important
pieces of work that could be undertaken by international cooperation.

The projects originally presented to the conference of the American Republics at
the City of Mexico, in so far as these are practicable, can best be carried out in the
following manner: That the directors of the national museums of the American
Republics and States, or, in case where there be none, then other.representatives of
these countries, be constituted as a body, with wholly advisory functions, to meet
once every three years, or oftener should occasion arise, to consider archzeological
and ethnological interests. The meetings and deliberations of this body should be
conducted under the auspices of the Bureau of American Republics, which might
publish such reports as might be approved by a proper committee of the meeting.
The organization here suggested to carry out the purposes of the project could be
effected with slight expense to the States adhering to the plan.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES AND EXPOSITIONS.

The Institution was called upon during the year to designate dele-
gates to an unusual number of international scientific congresses, and
several more were under consideration at the close of the fiscal year.

Congress of Americanists.—Mr. William H. Holmes, Chief of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, was appointed delegate of the Insti-
tution to the Fourteenth International Congress of Americanists to be
held at Stuttgart, August 18-23, 1904, and upon nomination by the
Institution the following persons were accredited by the Department
of State as United States delegates to the same congress: Dr. Franz
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

Boas, of the American Museum of Natural History; Mr. Marshall H.
Saville, of the Columbia University; Dr. George H. Dorsey, of the
Field Columbian Museum, and Doctor Currier, of ‘the Catholic
University of America’

Congress of Zoology.—Messrs. Leonhard Stejneger and Gerrit 5.
Miller, jr., of the United States National Museum, were appointed
representatives of the Institution and the Museum at the Sixth Inter-
national Congress on Zoology, to be held at Berne, Switzerland,
August 14-19.

Congress of Hducation.—Dr. Cyrus Adler was appointed delegate
of the Smithsonian Institution to the International Congress of Edu-
eation, held in St. Louis June 28 to July 1, 1904, but finding it impos-
sible to attend he was represented by Dr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., of the
National Museum.

Congress of Orientalists.—Prof. Paul Haupt, honorary curator of
the Division of Historie Archeology in the United States National
Museum, was appointed representative of the Smithsonian Institution
and the National Museum at the Fourteenth International Congress of
Orientalists, to be held at Algiers in April, 1905.

Congress of Geology.—Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the National
Museum, was appointed delegate of the Institution to the Ninth Inter-
national Geological Congress held at Vienna, August 20-29 1903. He
reports that there were 355 members in attendance, including 22 from
the United States. The standard of the papers presented was high.
One day was occupied by 7 speakers from various parts of the world
in presenting a synopsis of present knowledge of crystalline rocks.
Another day was devoted to ‘* Faults and Clefts,” and a third day was
given toa presentation of the geology of the Balkan Peninsula and
the Orient.

Archeological Congress. —Dr. Franz Boas was appointed United
States delegate to the Congress of the Archeological and Historical
Federation of Belgium, to be held at Mons in July and August, 1904,

Louisiana Purchase Krposition.—By an act of Congress approved
March 38, 1901, liberal provision was made for an exhibit at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition by the Executive Departments, the
Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, the Fish Commission,
and the Department of Labor, ‘of such articles and objects as illus-
trate the functions and administrative faculty of the Government in
time of peace and its resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate
the nature of our institutions and their adaptation to the wants of the
people.” The preparation of this exhibit was placed in charge of a
Government board upon which Dr. Frederick W. True, head curator
of the department of biology in the National Museum, was appointed
as representative of the Smithsonian Institution. The exposition was
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

postponed from 1903 to 1904, and opportunity was thus offered for the
preparation of an adequate display that might illustrate the functions
of the Institution and its dependencies.

The Smithsonian exhibit proper is installed in the Government build-
ing in a pavilion which overlooks the space assigned to its various
bureaus. It contains memorials and a portrait of the founder, James
Smithson, and a complete series of the several hundred publications of
the Institution, which represents one of the chief means adopted for
‘arrying out his purpose ** The increase and diffusion of knowledge.”
Portraits of the chancellors and secretaries of the Institution are also
shown, as well as that of Mr. Thomas George Hodgkins, the donor of
the Hodgkins fund. Printed matter, setting forth the objects to which
this fund is devoted and the reports of important original researches
which it has aided by means of grants, are also exhibited, with repro-
ductions of the Hodgkins gold medal, which is awarded biennially for
noteworthy investigations regarding the nature of atmospheric air in
connection with the welfare of man. One of the features of the
exhibit is a quarter-size model of the large aerodrome with which
experiments were conducted during the summer and autumn of 1903,
a model, driven by a gasoline engine, which itself has flown a distance
of nearly a quarter of a mile. The steam-driven model with which
experiments were successfully made in 1896 is also exhibited.

The work of the Astrophysical Observatory is illustrated in a
graphic manner by the installation of the great coelostat, arranged to
throw a beam of sunlight into a darkened room where there is shown
a solar image about a yard in diameter, thrown up by a 6-inch tele-
scope, and the solar spectrum is formed upon the walls by a large
concave grating. Bolometric apparatus is in actual operation, while
a display of transparencies illustrates the apparatus and results of
researches by the Observatory.

Charts and other objects are displayed explanatory of the useful
work carried on by the International Exchanges in distributing scien-
tific publications throughout the world.

The various departments of the National Museum are fully repre-
sented. Among some of the objects displayed I may mention a resto-
ration of the extinct reptile known as the Stegasaur, about 25 feet

long, which is not unlike a large horned toad, with a double row of

2,
large, flat spines along the tail; a collection of meteorites and casts of
some of the largest meteorites known, one of them exceeding 20 feet
in length and weighing many tons; a collection of some of the most
beautiful kinds of minerals from all parts of the world; the model of a
whale 80 feet long as showing the appearance of the greatest of all
living animals; groups of game birds, the wonderful birds of paradise,
the gorgeous pheasants, and birds of prey; and a remarkably perfect
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 97

egg of the gigantic bird of Madagascar, the Aepyornis, the egg meas-
uring about a foot long. -

The Children’s Room in the, Institution is reproduced in full size,
together with its cases, aquaria, bird cages, decorations, and as many
of the objects as could be duplicated. There is thus shown a lillipu-
tian museum which has proved very attractive to the older as well as
younger visitors to the Exposition.

A gigantic bird cage, in which many species of birds have almost as
much freedom of movement as if they were without restraint by bars
and nets, illustrates the National Zoological Park.

The collections are mentioned with somewhat more detail in the
Appendix, and in the report by Doctor True, to be published later in
another volume, full details will be given of these exhibits as well as
descriptions of some great models of Mayan temples of Yucatan,
shown by the Bureau of American Ethnology.

Lewis and Clark Exposition.—Congress during the past year made
provision for a Government exhibit at an exposition to be opened at
Portland, Oreg., in May, 1905, to commemorate the centennial of the
Lewis and Clark Expedition to the Northwest, and Dr. F. W. ‘True
has been designated as representative of the Institution to prepare a
suitable Smithsonian exhibit.

MISCELLANEOUS.

University of Wisconsin.—Dr. James B. Angeil, president of the
University of Michigan and Regent of the Smithsonian Institution,
represented the Institution at the celebration of the fiftieth anniver-
sary of the first commencement of the University of Wisconsin, held
at Madison during the week beginning June 5, 1904, and presented
the congratulations, signed by the Secretary, in the fodowing form:

The Smithsonian Institution extends to the president, the regents, and the faculty
of the University of Wisconsin its congratulations on the occasion of the fiftieth anni-
versary of the first commencement of the university. It felicitates the university on
the important work accomplished by it for learning and education in the State of
Wisconsin, and, recognizing its influence also in sister institutions of learning, sends
heartiest wishes for its continued prosperity and usefulness.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The most notable event of the year was that on June 15, 1904,
ground was broken for the new Museum building which was author-
ized by act of Congress approved March 3, 1903, the first sod being
turned by mein the presence of the architects, the superintendent of
construction, and the officers and employees of the Institution and
its dependencies. The new structure will be erected on the north-
ern side of the Smithsonian Park and will be about 551 feet long

‘
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and 318 feet wide, giving a floor area of about 9} acres in its four
stories.

The year which sees this most important material accession has been
one in which the Museum’s most important possession, in the men of
science who have devoted themselves to its work with a disinterested
zeal, has suffered a loss in the resignation of a number of its staff,
from the lack of appreciation by Congress which would permit it to retain
their services. The time in the Museum’s history has come, anticipated
in my previous reports, when the staff so slowly gathered, and which
is to occupy this new building, is beginning to decline. I feel com-
pelled here at the outset to call attention to the inadequate salaries
paid to the scientific and clerical staff of the Museum, a circumstance
that during the past year has caused the resignation of several of the
curators, who have accepted similar positions offering greater com-
pensation in other cities. An increase in the Museum appropriation
has been asked of Congress, since under the present appropriation it
is impossible to maintain a proper staff of efficient scientific assistants
or clerical help.

Good progress has been made in the regular operations of the
Museum, although much time of the scientific staff has been devoted
to the preparation of exhibits for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.

The new accessions aggregated 241,547 specimens, making the pres-
ent total census of collections 5,891,000 objects. Important new
accessions in the anthropological, biological, and geological depart-
ments are enumerated by the Assistant Secretary in the appendix to
this report.

I may mention here the continued interest in the National Collec-
tions manifested by Dr. W. L. Abbott, who each year presents to the
Museum many objects collected by him during his anthropological
and natural history researches in the Far East, the specimens received
during the last year consisting chiefly of ethnological objects from the
Malay Peninsula and northern Sumatra. Ethnological specimens col-
lected in the Philippine Islands by Drs. E. A. Mearns and R. B. Grubb, of
the United States Army, and objects of interest collected in Alaska by
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, of the United States Navy, evidence the pres-
ent interest of many Government officials in the work of the National
Museum. The Bureau of Ordnance of the War Department has
deposited 615 varieties of firearms of historical value.

The National Museum acquires its collections mainly through Gov-
ernment surveys, by gift and by exchange, but, depending upon these
means alone, its collections can never be made complete in any par-
ticular. Provision should be made for filling at least the more
important gaps by purchase. The objects to be obtained in this man-
ner are generally such as find their way into the hands of individuals
who have been at greater or less expense in obtaining them, and who,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

therefore, can not be expected to part with them except by sale.
About four years ago a specific item for purchase was agreed to by
Congress, and while the sum. allowed was altogether inadequate to
meet the requirements of the Museum, yet through it many important
objects were secured. In the appropriation bill for the past year this
item was omitted by Congress, and many objects which should have
come into the possession of the Government have been obtained by
other museums. This is especially the case in connection with the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, where excéptional opportunities were
presented for enriching the National Collections with needed material.

When the Museum building was erected, the need of a working
library actually at hand was felt, and through the generosity of Pro-
fessor Baird, who presented his entire private collection of scientific
publications to the National Museum, the nucleus for such a library
was established. In the years following, the Library of Congress
became so overcrowded that it was glad to have retained at the Museum
as much of the Smithsonian Library as was useful, and to send down
for indefinite deposit as many of the Smithsonian books as were
required. This condition no longer obtains, however, and an enlarged
working library for the Museum has become absolutely essential, if
the provisions of Congressional enactments for the classification and
arrangement of its collections are to be carried into effect. The sums
of money heretofore available have not sufficed even for the purchase
of all such books needed in the work as were not contained in the col-
lection of the Library of Congress or in the Smithsonian deposit, and
the increase requested is a low estimate for the actual requirements of
the Museum.

The National Museum is open to the public only on week days, from
9a.m. to 4.30 p. m., and its important educational features are restricted
to persons having leisure only during official hours. It has long been
urged that means be granted for so extending the hours of opening
that no one shall be deprived of the advantages which it offers for
instruction and enlightenment. Such an arrangement has been in suc-
cessful operation at the Library of Congress for several years, and a
similar course has long been followed by the larger museums elsewhere
in this country and in most European capitals. The National Museum
has recently been provided with a complete installation of electric
wires and lamps, and could, therefore, be opened both evenings and Sun-
days at the mere cost of the necessary additional supplies and help. The
Smithsonian building, however, has not yet been furnished with the
means for lighting the public halls, but could be opened on Sundays.
The expense involved is that needed for obtaining the extra amount of
coal and of electric current required, and for the employment of a few
additional persons to supplement the night and Sunday watch force,

.
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which is very small. Three plans are suggested for the extension of
the hours of opening. ‘The first includes every week-day evening and
Sundays; the second, three evenings during each week and every Sun-
day; the third, Sundays only. The first plan most strongly commends
itself.

The progress of the work of classifying and arranging the collee-
tions both for exhibition and for study has been greatly retarded, as
during many years past, by lack of space and by reason of the insufli-
cient force provided. The difficulty in regard to space will cease with
the completion of the new building authorized by Congress in 1903,
but that completion is still years distant. I can not too strongly urge
that when the building is ready an adequate staff of scientific men can
not be improvised, but that such an one must be largely gathered in
the time which now offers for preparation if one is to be provided
adequate to the demand.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The past year’s work of the Bureau has continued mainly along the
usual lines, and in a number of directions is making rapid progress
toward final results.

The research work among the aborigines has been carried forward
in four widely distributed regions—among: the Haida tribes of the
Queen Charlotte Islands and southern Alaska; among the Pueblo
Indians of New Mexico; among a number of tribes of the great plains
in Oklahoma and Indian Territory, and in the West Indies where the
interesting and obscure problems of the ancient remains and tribal
remnants are receiving deserved attention. The studies in these sev-
eral fields are now gradually approaching completion, and monographs
embodying the results are in hand.

In the field of linguistics much attention has been given to the col-
lection of data from the tribes and the preparation of a handbook of
the American languages, which is expected to mark a very decided
advance in the knowledge of primitive tongues.

An important feature of the year’s work was the preparation and
installation of an exhibit intended to illustrate at the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition certain phases of the Bureau’s work, and special
studies were pursued and collections made for this purpose.

A measure for the preservation of our national antiquities was intro
duced in the Senate by Senator Cullom, and a similar measure was
offered in the House of Representatives by. Mr. Hitt. Since other
legislation along the same lines has been proposed to Congress and the

subject is still under discussion, no final action having been taken, it
is not desired to say more here than that the Institution, through the
Bureau of American Ethnology, is deeply interested in the proposed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

plan for preserving the antiquities of our country and awaits the com-
mands of Congress in the matter.

I have continued to take much interest in the preparation of the
Dictionary of Indian Tribes, not only for its value as a scientific
memoir, but especially for its hoped-for utility in bringing before
Congress the past, present, and future work of the Bureau. I stated
in my last year’s report that the work contemplates the publication of
two octavo volumes, embodying in compact form information gath-
ered by the Bureau during the past years regarding Ametican races,
the first of which volumes, it was then believed, would be ready for
the press at the close of the year. The distribution of this important
work has been delayed beyond the time anticipated, owing to the desire
of those engaged in it to have it represent the latest views of ethnolo-
gists on the subjects treated, as well as a history of the past work of
the Bureau, and to the fact that the means at disposal have not per-
mitted that provision of skilled assistants which would haye enabled
the work to be completed at the time at first confidently expected. It
is now believed that the first volume of the dictionary will be ready
for the printer before the appearance of the present report, though it
may yet be some time before it is received from the press, owing to
the time actually required for the printing of the volume.

The printing of the annual reports and bulletins, including various
scientific papers, is progressing favorably, and matter for the Twenty-
fourth Annual volume, that for 1904, is practically ready for the press.

It is believed that important results would be derived from a study
of the languages, manners, and customs of the natives of Hawaii and
Tutuila, and Congress has been asked to approve the extension of the
activities of the Bureau to these islands.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service has for many years been the
medium of exchanging the official publications of the United States
Government with those of foreign countries and a like interchange of
the publications of the Smithsonian Institution and of the principal
scientific societies of this country with those of scientific bodies
throughout the world. A new exchange list of foreign institutions
was published during the year numbering 12,720 addresses, an increase
of 3,306 addresses of such institutions since the publication of the last
list in 1897. The total number of foreign and domestic correspond-
ents Is now 48,072, an increase of 4,060 correspondents during the past
year. Of this number 16,721 are classed as institutions and 31,351 as
individuals, the United States patrons of the service including 5,464
institutions and 6,450 individuals. The operations of the service dur-
ing the last fiscal year show a gain of 8,766 in the number of packages
oz REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

handled, the total for the year being 158,983, having an aggregate
weight of 481,410 pounds.

The chief clerk of the service, Mr. W. Irving Adams, visited
Europe during the year and was successful in promoting a more gen-
eral interest in the interchange of books with several countries, as
well as inaugurating many improvements in the prompt transmission
of packages.

Dr. Carl Felix Alfred Fliigel, who had served as agent of the Insti-
tution at Leipzig for forty-nine years, died on February 6, 1904, and
was succeeded by Mr. Karl W. Hiersemann, of the same Gee

Some progress has been made toward the reestablishment of exchange
relations with China, and in general the condition of the ‘t‘ Exchanges”
is one to cause satisfaction to those who are laboring for its advance.

YATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Under the. care of the Regents the National Zoological Park con-
tinues to fulfill the objects of Congress in its foundation so effectively
that perhaps no department of the Government service gives such
widespread benefit in health and pleasure to the inhabitants of the
District. As a consequence the nwuber of visitors constantly con-
tinues to increase, there having been considerably more than a million
during the past year.

The number of animals exhibited and meaner in the park has
gradually augmented year by year, the net increase during the past
season amounting to more than 10 per cent of the total on hand at the
beginning of that period. This has necessarily occasioned a crowding,
which is not conducive to the welfare of the animals. In order to
relieve this in some degree, it was decided to build a new house which
should serve as quarters for some of the more important ones and in
which they would be under more wholesome conditions of tempera-
ture. This house will be a substantial stone structure, not unduly
conspicuous, but harmonizing with the group in which it stands. At
the present time only the walls of this building are completed. The
cost of construction will be defrayed from the general appropriation
for the park, which necessarily prevents any considerable expenditure
of funds for other objects than the maintenance and care of the collec-
tion. A plan of the building is given in the superintendent’s report
(Appendix IV).

I have in previous reports during the past ten years urged the
desirability—even the imperative necessity—of provision for the pres-
ervation of our vanishing races of animals, if they were to be saved
from extinction. Repeated experience has demonstrated the fact that
some of the largest of our native herbivorous animals will not thrive
when closely confined. Even the American bison, it appears, can not
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

long be successfully bred except where given extended range. Herds
kept on restricted areas may do well for a time, but eventually their
vitality becomes impaired, the birth rate diminishes, and it is only by
the addition of new animals bred in comparative freedom that the con
tinued propagation of the species under such conditions can be secured.
The recommendations made to Congress in previous years for the
establishment of preserves and other measures to insure the continued
existence of some of these notable animals have not secured favorable
action. I fear that already this matter is passing beyond control, for
no power can recall a vanished race.

The varied topography of the park, presenting as it does a succes-
sion of valleys and hillsides of unusual beauty, makes it eminently
adapted to such treatment as would protect indigenous flowers and
trees and maintain them in the best conditions attainable. What is
known to landscape gardeners as a ** wild garden”—that is to say, a plan-
tation of indigenous plants allowed to grow with freedom, yet arranged
so as to produce unobtrusive artistic effects—can be applied to many
portions of the park with excellent results. Something of this kind
will probably be attempted on a small scale should the appropriation
permit. All such attempts, however, should and will be made subor-
dinate to the prime object of the park, namely, that of maintaining a
zoological collection.

The policy of encouraging wild animals and birds to make the park
their home has been increasingly followed, and were it practicable to
employ sufficient force to thoroughly police the park and its entrances,
herds of Virgina deer and perhaps of the American antelope might be
allowed to run free within it. The principal difficulty experienced in
caring for animals and birds thus running wild lies in their tendency
to stray away and get into the more extensive woods in the Rock
Creek Park or its neighborhood, where they are often killed. It
would be an advantage if the killing of game animals could be abso-
lutely prohibited in the District of Columbia, for if such prohibition
were made it would be possible within a few years to have a consider-
able collection of animals and birds living in perfectly natural condi-
tions and with but little fear of man. I shall gladly aid in procuring
any legislation to this end.

In order to bring to the notice of the general public the aims and
objects of the National Zoological Park, it was thought desirable to
make at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition a more significant exhibit
than has heretofore been shown. Accordingly application was made
fora large ‘*flying-cage” in which to exhibit birds in conditions as nearly
natural as possible. The United States Government Board considered
the matter favorably, and an exhibit of this character was accordingly
installed, and at the close of the year was in successful operation. I

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

have been pleased to learn that no part of the Government exhibits has
excited more popular interest there.

Congress at its last session took up the important question of the
definitive arrangement of streets in the vicinity of the Zoological Park,
and established, by law, two such thoroughfares, one on the south-
eastern, the other on the western side of the park. Two comparatively
narrow strips are thus left between these roads and the park boundary,
and it would be of great advantage if these strips could be added to
the park. Attention has been called to this matter in previous reports,
and I have again submitted to Congress an estimate of the sum required
to effect the necessary purchase.

I can, in conclusion, repeat my statement that the park is fulfilling
more amply than ever the objects for which Congress founded it,
**the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the
people.”

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

In my last year’s report I stated that it was probable that the radia-
tion of the sun after absorption by the earth’s atmosphere as received
at Washington, appeared to have fallen off by 10 per cent, and I added
that there had possibly been a decrease of the solar radiation itself
since the early part of the year 1903. I observed in this connection
that there seemed renewed promise of progress toward thesforetelling
by such means of the remoter changes of weather which affect harvests,
which was one of the great aims had in view in the foundation of the
observatory.

With the aid of the large horizontal telescope and the apparatus
for obtaining distinct vision introduced by me and described in my
last report, and more fully in that for the present year, I have con-
tinued these investigations, particularly with reference to the increase
or diminution of the original solar radiation, apart from that absorbed
by the earth’s atmosphere, and by means which are unaffected by that —
absorption. These observations, independent of any theory upon the
subject, indicated that at the time of the observation in the last report
this radiation fell off at the source of energy in the sun, and that
changes in the transmissibility of the solar atmosphere were a possible
cause of at least a part of the effect observed on the earth. The amount
by which this solar radiation was diminished, as determined at the
source in the sun itself, appears to be in general accord with the state-
ments of meteorological observatories as to the changed temperature
at the earth’s surface. I do not, however, venture to make the state-
ment that the diminution was unquestionably due to a change in the
solar envelope as an established fact, until further observations have
been made, while I still call attention to the high importance of addi-
tional study of the question.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

NECROLOGY.
DR. CARL *LFRED FELIX FLUGEL.

In the death of Doctor Fliigel, which occurred in Leipzig, February
6, 1904, the Smithsonian Institution lost a loyal assistant and an intel-
ligent and capable representative. Doctor Fliigel was appointed agent
of the International Exchange Service of the Institution for Germany,
Austria, and the adjacent countries in 1855, a position he filled for the
remaining nearly fifty years of his life. He was the official successor
of his father, Dr. Johann Gottfried Fligel, who was made agent of
the Smithsonian Exchange Service, at the time of its organization in
1847, by Prof. Joseph Henry, tirst Secretary of the Institution, he also
having filled the position until his death in 1854. The son succeeded
his father as United States vice-consul in Leipzig also, this position
under the Government proving likewise a life appointment in the case
of both father and son.

Dr. Felix Fliigel was scholarly in his tastes and occupations by both
inheritance and training, the father having been the first lecturer in
English in the University of Leipzig, where he received his doctor’s
degree in 1824, publishing in the same year a Grammar of the English
Language, which remains a noteworthy record of the earlier period of
English philology in Germany. Both father and son were persever-
ing and laborious students in English, each publishing pamphlets and
critical essays on the language, and each being the author of an English
and German dictionary, that of the son having become a standard
work, which reached its fifteenth edition in 1891.

The long tenure of office of Dr. Felix Fliigel gave him an excep-
tional opportunity to further the exchange work of the Smithsonian
Institution throughout central Europe, and believing that the system
was an important medium of scientific intercourse between the United
States and Europe, he labored untiringly for its development along
practical lines, at the same time adding to exact business methods the
charm of a personal courtesy and kindness which won many friends.

It would be difficult to overestimate the intelligent and faithful serv-
ice rendered to the Institution for so many years by Doctor Fliigel,
and the appreciation of his character expressed by those officials whose
fortune it was to know him personally is a sincere tribute to his
capability and worth.

DR. HENRY CARRINGTON BOLTON.

Doctor Bolton, who died on November 19, 1903, was an earnest worker
in the field of chemical bibliography. He unselfishly devoted many
years of patient personal toil to the preparation of reference books
of much value to all interested in the study of chemistry. He also

ry
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

compiled a catalogue of scientific periodicals of the world. Many of
the results of his labors were by him freely presented to the Smith-
sonian Institution and were published in the series of Miscellaneous
Collections.

Doctor Bolton was born in New York City January 28, 1843. He
graduated from Columbia College in 1862, and during the next four
years studied at Heidelberg and Berlin, in 1866 receiving the degree
of Ph. D. at Géttingen. In 1875 he was assistant in the laboratory
of the Columbia School of Mines, in 1875 professor of chemistry at
the Woman’s College of the New York Infirmary, from 1877 to 1887
professor of chemistry at Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., when he
retired from teaching and devoted the remaining years of his life
chiefly to literary pursuits and to travel. For several years his winter
home was in Washington City. He was a member of the New York
Academy of Science (its president in 1893), of the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science, and one of the founders of the
American Folk Lore Society. In 1897 he was president of the Library
Association of Washington City; was president of the American
Chemical Society in 1900, and was also a member of many other
learned bodies in Europe and the United States, being a frequent
contributor to their literary exercises and published transactions.

His varied contributions td contemporary literature cover more
than 200 titles, among which may be mentioned The Scientific Corre-
spondence of Joseph Priestley; Counting-Out Rhymes of Children;
Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 1665-1897, and
Select Bibliography of Chemistry, 1492-1902.

APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.

REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Srr: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the condition and oper-
ations of the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1904.

Ground was broken on June 15, 1904, for the new Museum building authorized by
Congress in 1903, the first sod being turned by the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution in the presence of the architects, the superintendent of construction, and
the officers and employees of the Institution and its Bureaus. The excavation for
the foundation and basement was well under way at the close of the fiscal year, and
it is hoped that nothing will arise to interfere with the speedy construction of the
building. This additional home for the National Collections will be about 551
feet long and 318 feet wide, exclusive of projections, thus exceeding in these dimen-
sions all other buildings in the city of Washington except the Capitol. Its faces will
be of light-colored granite, and its four stories will afford a floor area of about 93
acres.

It is gratifying to be able to state that notwithstanding the great pressure of work
in the scientific departments, caused by the preparation of exhibits for the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition, very satisfactory progress has been made in all of the operations
of the Museum.

The number of accessions received during the year was 1,703, or 60 more than in
1903, and comprise a total of 241,547 specimens. Profitable exchanges have been
made with other institutions and with private collectors, the number of duplicate
specimens utilized for this purpose exceeding 9,000.

The number of publications issued has been somewhat larger than usual, and their
distribution, together with a large increase in the extent of the correspondence, has
taxed to the utmost the office charged with these matters.

The reserve or study collections have been extensively used by investigators and
students both in Washington and elsewhere, and more than 20,000 specimens have
been sent to specialists for examination and report. The number of lots of speci-
mens received for identification has been 975.

Buildings.—The roofs on the Museum building, and especially those covered with
slate, have fora long period been ina very unsatisfactory condition, resulting mainly
from the fact that they were constructed too cheaply in the beginning, and there-
fore not as substantially as they should have been. Through the contraction and
expansion of the iron supports by changes in temperature, the slate coverings have
never been kept tight, and in other parts there has been greater or less trouble in
regard to leakage, which has caused a constant defacement of the inner walls and
some injury to the contents of the building. It is now realized that the only proper
remedy would be to substitute a new roof for the present one, but as this can not be
done at present, an effort is being made to institute more substantial repairs than
heretofore, though at the best they can only be considered as temporary. The tin

. 37

coverings, gutters, ete., do not present serious difficulties, though requiring exten-
sive renovation. Experiments on the slate, however, have led to the trial of a coy-
ering of asphalt, burlap, and slag, which has thus far resulted so favorably that it is
now proposed to treat all the slate roofs in this manner.

The archeological exhibition hall, the large upper room in the Smithsonian build-
ing, which has been closed for some time on account of the extensive loosening and
fall of plaster, has been entirely repaired and painted during the past year, but its
opening to the public must be deferred for a while longer, or until its collections
have been reinstalled. Many other repairs in both buildings have been made during
the year, but they have been chiefly of a minor character.

The number of specimen cases constructed has amounted to 212, and of specimen
drawers to 3,378, mainly to accommodate the extensive accessions of the year, derived
in greater part from Government scientific surveys. The fittings of all kinds for the
cases and for the mounting of specimens have called for a large amount of labor and
material.

The pair of high-pressure steam boilers installed in the summer of 1901 for the
heating of the two main buildings and the smaller adjacent buildings has continued
to give entire satisfaction. The efficiency of the fire-protective system has been
thoroughly tested during the year, with the result that some of the extinguishers of
old pattern have been replaced by others of more modern make.

Organization and staff.—A tew changes in the organization of the Museum have
been made as follows:

The title of the ‘‘ Division of Religions’’ has been changed to ‘‘ Division of Historic
Religions,’’ with Dr. Cyrus Adler as honorary curator, and the former ‘Section of
Historic Religious Ceremonials’’ has been abolished. That of the ‘‘ Division of His-
tory and Biography’’ has been changed to ‘‘ Division of History,’’ with Mr. A.
Howard Clark as honorary curator and Mr. Paul E. Beckwith as assistant curator,
the ‘Section of American History’’ being omitted. The ‘‘Section of Electricity”
has been abolished.

Mr. William H. Holmes, formerly head curator of the Department of Anthropology,
but now Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, has accepted the position of
honorary curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology, and Mr. J. D. McGuire
that of collaborator in the same division. Other appointments have been as follows:
Dr. Edward L. Greene, formerly professor of botany in the Catholic University of
America, as associate in botany; Mr. Paul Brockett as custodian of the Section of
Graphic Arts; Mr. Walter L. Hahn as aid in the Division of Mammals, and Mr, J. S.
Goldsmith as superintendent of construction and labor, being a part of the service
performed by the late Dr. J. E. Watkins, whose lamented death occurred on August
11, 1903,

A number of members of the scientific staff have severed their connection with the
Museum, all at their own volition, to accept positions at higher compensation else-
where. Among these were Mr. F. A. Lucas, curator of Comparative Anatomy, who
has become curator in chief of the museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and
Sciences; Mr. Louis Pollard, assistant curator in the Division of Plants; Mr. Rolla P.
Currie, aid in the Division of Insects; and Mr. W. C. Phalen, aid, and Mr. R.8. Bassler
and Mr. Alvan Stewart, preparators, in the Department of Geology.

It may also be mentioned in this connection that Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant
curator of Stratigraphic Paleontology, attended the Ninth International Geological
Congress, held at Vienna from August 20 to 27, 1903, as the representative of the
Smithsonian Institution and the Museum; while in the same capacity Mr. Leonhard
Stejneger, curator of Reptiles, Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., assistant curator of Mammals,
and Dr. C. W. Stiles, custodian of Helminthological Collections, will be present at
the Sixth International Congress of Zoology at Berne during August of this year,
and Mr. William H. Holmes at the Congress of Americanists to be held at Stuttgart
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

during the same month, Messrs. Stejneger, Miller, Stiles, and Holmes have also been
designated by the Department of State as official representatives of the Government
on the two occasions named: od

Additions to the collections.The number of separate lots of material received during
the year was 1,703, comprising 241,547 specimens in all, or 5,000 more than the pre-
vious year. The total number of specimens recorded in all departments of the Museum
is now 5,894,620 specimens, of which more than 4,100,000 belong to the Department
of Biology, nearly 975,000 to the Department of Anthropology, and about 730,000 to
the Department of Geology.

Collections sent by Dr. W. L. Abbott from the Malay peninsula, northern Sumatra,
and the adjacent archipelago contain the most interesting additions in Anthropology,
and in conjunction with his previous contributions from the same and other parts of
Asia constitute an exceedingly valuable and unique feature of the ethnological
exhibits. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. 8S. Army, who has continued his scientific work in
the Philippine Islands, presented collections of special interest obtained by himself
during the campaign against the Moros. Another Moro collection, consisting of
edged weapons, spears, and costumes, was received from Dr. R. B. Grubb, also of
the United States Army. The very valuable collection of archeological objects
obtained in Cuba, Trinidad, Grenada, Barbados, Dominica, Porto Rico, and other
West Indian islands by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
during the winter of 1903, has been transferred to the keeping of the Museum. — It
contains a very large variety of objects which will probably aid materially in solving
the problem of the ancient relations between North and South America. The same
Bureau has also deposited a large series of specimens recently taken from caverns,
rock shelters, and village sites in the Ozark region of Missouri and Arkansas. A
number of Tlinkit house posts and totem poles was obtained from Dr. George A.
Dorsey, of the Field Columbian Museum, and a valuable lot of art objects from south-
western Alaska, consisting of carved clubs, knives, embroidered blankets, ete., from
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U. 8. Navy. Some curious earthenware vessels from aboriginal
graves in Argentina were presented by Mr. Felix F. Outes, of Buenos Aires, and
several knives with handles and blades in one piece, as well as flint implements,
from the temple of Osiris, Abydos, were contributed by the Egypt exploration fund.

The collections in prehistoric archeology have been enriched by a series of Egyptian
stone implements presented by Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr, of England, and representing
a type peculiar to the Fayum district, as well as by a large series of specimens chiefly
from a few localities in the Miami Valley, and forming part of the bequest of the
late I. H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio. The latter contribution also includes a
typical series of earthenware vessels from mounds near Charleston, Mo.

To the recently established Division of Physical Anthropology have been added
more than 2,000 crania and skeletons by transfer from the Army Medical Museum,
11 crania of Wasco Indians from the Fred Harvey collection, and other desirable
specimens.

The additions to the historical collections have included a valuable series of relies
presented by Gen. John Watts de Peyster, who has also made several contributions
of important historical works; the gilt dress sword presented to Gen. Jacob Brown,
by the State of New York, for valuable services during the Revolutionary war,
donated by his grandson, Mr. Nathan Brown Chase; an oil portrait of George Catlin,
painted by W. H. Fisk, R. A., in 1849, deposited by his daughter, Mrs. Louise
Catlin Kinney; numerous relics deposited by the National Society of the Daughters
of the American Revolution, and the sword and epaulettes worn a Gen. Alex.
McComb, U. 8. Army.

The technological exhibits have been materially increased; among the accessions
of special interest being a collection of rifles, muskets, and other firearms of his-
torical value, 615 in number, deposited by the Bureau of Ordnance of the War
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Department; a collection of Morse telegraph keys, insulators, and other electrical
apparatus, presented by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company; a collection illustrat-
ing the development of the hand camera, by the Eastman Kodak Company; a
collection of sporting rifles of the kind used in this country prior to 1850, lent by
Mr. Herman Hollerith, and a rare form of flintlock pistol with folding bayonet,
presented by Mr. Paul Beckwith.

The accessions to the Departme. t of Biology embraced 151,000 specimens, or nearly
41,000 more than the previous year. The collection of insects was increased by
about 59,000 specimens, the herbarium by about 43,000, while the remaining 49,000
specimens were divided among the other divisions.

The most extensive of the zoological collections, in point of number of specimens,
consisted of about 40,000 insects obtained in British Columbia by Dr. Harrison G.
Dyar, assisted by Mr. Rolla P. Currie and Mr. A. N. Caudell. The Bureau of Fish-
eries transmitted large collections of land and fresh-water shells, reptiles, and crus-
taceans from Indiana and other States; a valuable series of marine mollusks, chiefly
from Alaska; the types of recently described fishes from Japan, the Hawaiian
Islands, ete.; fishes, crustaceans, and corals secured in connection with the Alaskan
salmon-fisheries investigation of 1903, and 461 plants from Alaska and Oregon.

Especially worthy of mention are the important zoological contributions from the
Mentawei Archipelago, Sumatra, and various islands off the eastern coast of Sumatra,
obtained and presented by Dr. William L. Abbott. Thirty-one new forms of mam-
mals and several new species of birds are represented in the collection from the
archipelago, while those from eastern Sumatra also contain very valuable material,
including numerous forms of birds and reptiles not previously received. Several
valuable lots of zoological specimens from Minnesota and the Philippine Islands
were donated by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. Army. <A large number of mammals,
birds, reptiles, and fishes from the Bahama Islands were secured as the result of the
expedition sent to those islands by the Baltimore Geographical Society, and of
which Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley, of the Museum staff, were members.
A valuable collection of birds’ eggs and reptiles from Texas was transmitted by the
Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture.

Noteworthy among the mammals received were a specimen of a remarkable species
of bat, Huderma maculatum, presented by Mr. E. O. Wooton, of Mesilla Park, N. Mex.;
the first authentic specimen of a jaguar from the United States; a rare mouse-deer,
Tragulus stanleyanus, obtained from M. Emile Deschamps; a collection of Old World
mammals, obtained from W. Schliter; a collection of Japanese mammals from
Mr. T. Tsuchida; some rare forms of bats from the British Museum, and a collection
of Colombian mammals from the American Museum of Natural History.

An interesting series of birds of the Philippine Islands was secured by exchange
with the Museum in Manila. Mr. Homer Davenport, of East Orange, N. J., pre-
sented a number of young pheasants, and Mr. N. C. Brown, of Portland, Me., a well-
prepared series of the birds of North Carolina. Four species of birds of paradise,
new to the collection, were purchased. Dr. W. L. Ralph, of the Museum staff, and
Gen. J. W. Barlow made generous contributions to the collection of birds’ eggs, and
series of rare Mexican eggs and of the eggs of the Hoactzin were purchased.

A collection of Japanese reptiles was presented by Dr. Hugh M. Smith, and some
rare reptiles of southern Florida by Mr. E. J. Brown, of Lemon City, Fla. The
Division of Fishes has received a large number of Japanese species from the Leland
Stanford Junior University, and a well-prepared series of specimens from Puget
Sound, donated by Dr. J. C. Thompson, U. 8. Navy. A specimen of the Japanese
shark, Mitsukuria owstoni, was purchased.

Hawaiian land shells and other invertebrates were received from Mr. H. W. Hen-
shaw, of Hilo, Hawaii; Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, honorary associate in zoology, now
residing in Los Angeles, Cal., presented an extensive series of west American shells,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

and Mr. H. N. Lowe and Mrs. Blanche Trask, several lots of Californian shells; Mr.
E. J. Court, of Washington, .B. C., donated a representative series of the land shells
of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia; Dr. Dwight Blaney about 300
shells dredged near Mount Desert, Me., and Mr. C. A. Davis, many Bermuda shells,
including several cotypes. Among the specimens obtained by purchase was a large
collection of Japanese land and marine mollusks, and land shells from the Pacific
coast and the islands off California.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates received a collection of Mexican fresh-water
crabs from the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture; crustaceans from
Catalina and San Clemente Islands, presented by Mr. H. N. Lowe; cotypes of a
species of shrimp and of a stomatopod crustacean from the National Museum of
Brazil; several beautiful specimens of the Japanese precious coral from Dr. Kk.
Kishinouye; and a collection of sea urchins, chiefly from the Gulf of Siam, from the
Zoological Museum in Copenhagen.

The additions to the Division of Insects were numerous and valuable. Among
those of greatest importance may be noted two lots of over 6,000 specimens from the
Department of Agriculture; an extensive collection of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, ete.,
made by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, in Texas; several lots of Philippine insects from Rey.
W. A. Stanton, of Manila, and one from Mr. R. C. McGregor, of the Philippine
Museum; a large miscellaneous collection from the grounds of the Washington Biol-
ogists’s Field Club at Plummer’s Island; and a valuable collection of Lepidoptera,
from Mr. E. M. Anderson, of the Provincial Museum at Victoria, British Columbia.
From foreign sources the following collections were received as gifts: Indian Hymen-
optera from Maj. C. G. Nurse; Indian spiders from Prof. N. Jambunathan; Venezu-
elan beetles from Mr. Edward A. Klages; Peruvian insects from Mr. M. J. Pusey;
and Norwegian Lepidoptera from Sir George Hampson, of the British Museum.

Of 555 accessions to the Division of Plants, the most valuable was the deposit made
by Dr. E. L. Greene, of his collection of about 60,000 sheets of plants, and his entire
botanical library. Next in importance was the gift by Mrs. T. A. Williams, of Mem-
phis, Nebr., of about 15,000 piants from various parts of the United States. Mr. C.
V. Piper, of Pullman, Wash., presented more than 600 plants from that State, and
Mr. E. W. D. Holway, of Minneapolis, Minn., an interesting collection of Mexican
plants. Important exchanges were made with the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture,
the New York Botanical Garden, and the Royal Gardens at Kew, England. Sixty-
eight botanical accessions were received from the Department of Agriculture, the
most important comprising specimens obtained in Texas by Mr. Arthur Howell,
in New Mexico and Oklahoma by Mr. Fred. G. Plummer, and in New Mexico by
Mr. Vernon Bailey. Plants from Australia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and
from several of the States were acquired by purchase.

The most extensive additions to the geological collections were, as usual, received
from the United States GeMogical Survey, prominent among them having been about
40,000 invertebrate fossils, mostly named and including a large amount of material
on which Dr. William H. Dall and his assistants have been working for several years.
The Survey also transmitted a series of 1,932 tertiary insects, assembled by Dr. Samuel
H. Scudder, together with a number of original drawings. The acquisition of this
material is believed to make the Museum collection of fossil insects the largest in the
United States, if not in the world.

A collection of platiniferous rocks from the Demidoff mines in Russia was pre-
sented by Juarez Sponville; a series of rocks illustrating the occurrence and associa-
tion of diamonds at the De Beers consolidated mines in South Africa, by Mr. Gardner
F. Williams, manager of the mines; a rich nugget of native silver, by A. L. Pellegrin,
of Nogales, Ariz., and a specimen of diamond-bearing gravel from Minas Geraes,
Brazil, to which a small diamond was attached, by Dr. O. A. Derby, of Sao. Paulo.

ny
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A fine mass of amethystine quartz, weighing about 400 pounds, was obtained from
Ward’s Natural Science Establishment, Rochester, N. Y.

The Division of Minerals was enriched by a large collection illustrating the occur-
rence and association of the zeolites and siliceous minerals of New Jersey, obtained
through the assistance of Dr. W. S. Disbrow, of Newark, N.J., who also transmitted
one of the first known crystals of American spodumene. Other important gifts were
a specimen of pink spodumene, from Mr. F. M. Sickler; a series of artificial stones
used in the gem trade, from Mr. Oscar T. Jonassohn; a cut turquoise from North
Carolina, from Mr. Eugene A. Smith, and some fine specimens of smoky quartz from
Messrs. A. P. Pohndorf and J. R. Wharton.

For the meteorite collection specimens illustrating the Trenzano fall, the France-
ville iron, the Mukerop iron, and the Finnmarken pallasite have been acquired.

Of invertebrate fossils, the accession next in importance to that transferred by the
United States Geological Survey was the last portion of the E. O. Ulrich collection,
containing about 15,000 specimens, besides 500 lots of original types or of specimens
that have been used for illustration. A series of Lower Silurian fossils, selected by
Mr. Charles Schuchert while in Russia, was presented by the Imperial Academy of
Sciences, of St. Petersburg, through the cooperation of Dr. Frederich von Schmidt,
and a valuable donation consisting of nearly 600 specimens of Hamilton brachiopods
was received from the Yale University Museum. By exchange with the Zoological
Museum of the University of Copenhagen, more than a hundred specimens of
identified European mesozoic and tertiary bryozoans were obtained.

To the collection of fossil vertebrates were added fine specimens of pterodactyl,
ichthyosaurus, and teleosaurus; some fishes from the lithographic limestone, and a
fossil skull of Bison Alleni from a placer deposit of frozen gravel, 25 feet below the
surface. The object last mentioned was presented by Messrs. McLain and Ballou, of
Rampart City, Alaska, and is especially noteworthy as being the first specimen of the
species discovered in Alaska.

One hundred and thirty-two fossil plants collected in the Iowa anthracite beds
were donated by Mr. C. W. Unger, of Pottsville, Pa., and 190 specimens of fossil
plants from Illinois, Ohio, and other localities, forming part of the Carl Rominger
collection, were also obtained.

Explorations.—But few explorations were carried on last year by members of the
Museum staff, owing to the lack of funds. Dr. Walter Hough spent some time in
Arizona and New Mexico, where he made a large collection of ethnological and
archeological objects. The expedition sent to the Bahamas during the summer of
1903 by the Baltimore Geographical Society and Johns Hopkins University, under
the direction of Dr. G. B. Shattuck, was accompanied by Mr. Barton A. Bean and
Mr. J. H. Riley, who took an active part in the work of collecting and observation.
Dr. Harrison G. Dyar and Mr. Rolla P. Currie were members of a party sent to
British Columbia by the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburg. “During a trip to Europe Mr.
Charles Schuchert collected some valuable fossils, and while seeking material for the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition Dr. George P. Merrill obtained many geological
specimens for the Museum on the Pacific coast and in Canada and western Mexico.

Having been designated by the State Department and the Smithsonian Institution
as delegates to the International Congress of Zoology at Berne, Switzerland, during
the summer of 1904, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger and Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., left Wash-
ington in May with the object also of making collections of mammals and reptiles in
Kurope, and of studying the specimens of these groups in the principal European
museums. Short collecting trips, not necessary to mention here, were also made by
other members of the staff.

There have been many explorations through which the Museum has profited, by
private individuals and by other Government bureaus, of which a few may be noted.
Dr. William L. Abbot has continued his field work in Sumatra, the Mentawei Archi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

pelago, and along the coast and on the islands east of Sumatra. In connection with
the investigations of the Bureau of Fisheries, Dr. Hugh M. Smith has visited Japan,
and Dr. B. W. Evermann, Prof. Charles H. Gilbert, and Prof. O. P. Jenkins have
made extensive explorations‘in Hawaii. The natural history bureaus of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and especially the Biological Survey, have made important col-
lections in different parts of the United States.

Field work under the Bureau of American Ethnology, productive of collections,
has been carried on by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, in the West Indies, and by Mr. James
Mooney, Mr. Gerard Fowke, Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, and Mr. J. R. Swanton, in the
West. Reference should also be made to the important work conducted in the Phil-
ippine Islands by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. 8. Army, one of the most frequent contribu-
tors to the Museum collections.

Researches. —Ot the material which reaches the Museum, a part has previously been
studied and a part not, but the proportion either way would be difficult to state and
varies from year to year. The act founding the establishment provides that the
collections shall be arranged and classified, and therefore in selecting the caretakers,
persons skilled in the various branches represented are chosen to the extent of the
funds available. It is recognized that their first obligation is to look out for the
safety of the specimens in their charge, and as the technical staff under pay is rela-
tively small, attention to this duty consumes the greater part of their time. About
one-half of the scientific staff, moreover, consists of volunteers, on whom the same
demands can not be made, though some of these are equally attentive to the routine
work. The scientific results accomplished each year by the Museum staff as a whole
is, nevertheless, relatively extensive, comprising mainly the identification, labeling
and description of specimens, and their classified arrangement in cases and drawers,
so as to make them convenient for reference.

For a large part of the scientific work, however, assistance must be obtained from
experts connected with other establishments. Entire groups of specimens may be
assigned to individuals for working up, or advantage may be taken of researches in
progress elsewhere to have material of greater or less extent identified, and visiting
scientific men areoften willing to spend some time upon such parts of the collections
as come within their knowledge. It is impossible within the limits of this report to
account for all the work of this character carried on during the past year, but the
number of persons concerned, not including those on the Museum staff, was in the
neighborhood of 200, and over 20,000 specimens were sent away for study. The coop-
eration with persons living elsewhere is far greatest in connection with the Depart-
ment of Biology, whose varied collections have long attracted widespread interest,
and have led to many extensive and important investigations.

Exchanges.—Many exchanges of duplicate specimens with other institutions and
with individuals have been made with satisfactory results for the Museum. The
establishments abroad with which such transactions were most extensively carried
on were the Albany Museum at Grahamstown, South Africa; the K. K. Naturhis-
torisches Hofmuseum at Vienna; the Zoological Institute of the Imperial University
at Vienna; the Botanical Museum at Berlin; the Museum of Natural History at
Paris; the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen; the Royal Frederick
University of Christiania, and the Royal Botanic Garden at Sibpur, Calcutta.

The distribution of duplicates to colleges and other educational institutions through-
out the country has been limited during the year to fishes, marine invertebrates, and
geological specimens illustrating rock weathering and soil formation, of which 97 sets
have been sent out. Some duplicate sets of fossils are now being prepared for the
same purpose. The applications for such material to aid in the teaching of natural
history are far more numerous than can be supplied, the assistants qualified to select
and label the specimens being generally too busily occupied in other ways. The

.
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

present crowded condition of the Museum also interferes with the overhauling of the
collections, which is necessary in picking out the duplicates.

The exhibition halls.—A\though no increase in the amount of exhibition space is
possible in the present building, yet by resorting to various expedients and removing
specimens to storage a little more room may be obtained here and there for the dis-
play of exhibits or single objects which it is thought may prove of greater interest to
the public.

In the Department of Anthropology a few cases have been added in the northwest
court gallery for an exhibit of Indian baskets, this subject having gained special
prominence through the publication of Prof. O. T. Mason’s recent paper. Space has
also been provided for a portion of the splendid Malaysian collection received from
Dr. William L. Abbott. A collection of lamps, a typical series of guns, and three
table-cases containing revolvers and pistols of various dates and makes have been
arranged in the east hall, and a number of ethnological objects from the Philippine
Islands in the gallery of the northwest court. The collection of musical instruments
has been partly reinstalled. Among the technological objects has been placed the
cylinder of the Hornblower engine, the first steam engine put together on the western
continent, having been imported from England in 1753.

The groups of ethnological lay figures returned from recent expositions have been
installed wherever a place could be found for them, some having been arranged in
the lecture hall.

But little was done toward preparing new exhibits in the Department of Biology,
as other and more urgent work has interfered. Some of the more valuable birds
have been remounted, and four-groups of game birds have been installed in two new
cases at the entrance to the Smithsonian building. The unoccupied cases in the
southeast range set apart for casts of fishes will soon be filled by new preparations
now in course of making. A beginning has been made toward the installation of a
series of specimens illustrating the mollusk fauna of the District of Columbia, one
case having already been completed.

To the display collection in the Department of Geology have been added the skulls
of a new genus of Ceratopsia, and of Diplodocus and Trachodon, and also a mounted
skeleton of Syornis casuarinus from New Zealand. The Claosaurus, mentioned in
last year’s report, is exhibited near the south wall of the southeast court.

Visitors.—The number of persons who visited the Museum building during the
year was 220,778, and the Smithsonian building, 143,988, being an approximate daily
average of 705 for the former and of 460 for the latter. The decrease as compared
with the previous year was a result of the large attendance at the time of the encamp-
ment of the Grand Army of the Republic in October, 1902. Since the first occupa-
tion of the Museum building in 1881, the total number of visitors recorded has been
over 8,000,000.

Meetings and lectures.—On February 20 and 27, and March 5, 12, and 19, a series of
lectures was given in the lecture hall under the auspices of the Biological Society of
Washington by Mr. Charles H. Townsend, Mr. Gifford Pinchot, Mr. E. W. Nelson,
Prof. Henry F. Osborn, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, the average attendance having
been about 1,000. The closing exercises of the Naval Medical School and the Army
Medical School were held in the same place on March 21 and April 5, respectively.
The American Oriental Society had its annual meeting in the lecture hall on April
7 and 8, and the National Academy of Sciences from April 19 to 21. On June 13 an
illustrated lecture entitled ‘‘ Botanical Tramps with a Camera’’ was delivered by Dr.
C. KE. Waters, of Johns Hopkins University, under the auspices of the Wild Flower
Preservation Society of America.

Publications.—The publications issued during the year comprised 6 volumes and 59
technical Proceedings papers, being an increase over previous years, due partly to
delays in completing volumes belonging to 1903. The 6 volumes referred to were
Nos. 25, 26, and 27 of the Proceedings, the Annual Reports for 1901 and 1902, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

Prof. C. C. Nutting’s monograph on the Sertularian hydroids, forming part 2 of
Special Bulletin No.-4.

The three volumes of Proceedings contained in all 110 papers, of which 39 relate
to fishes, 19 to insects, 18 to marine invertebrates, 10 to birds, and the remainder to
mammals, mollusks, plants, reptiles, fossils, and meteorites.

The Appendix to the Report for 1901 was made up of five papers, as follows:
“Report on the Exhibit of the United States National Museum at the Pan-American
Exposition, Buffalo, N. Y., 1901;’’ ‘‘ Flint Implements and Fossil Remains from a
Sulphur Spring at Afton, Ind. T.,’’ and ‘‘ Classification and Arrangement of the
Exhibits of an Anthropological Museum,” by Mr. William H. Holmes; ‘‘Archeolog-
ical Field Work in Northeastern Arizona,’ by Dr. Walter Hough, and ‘“ Narrative
of a Visit to Indian Tribes of the Purus River, Brazil,’’ by Prof. J. B. Steere.

The Report for 1902 contained an elaborate paper by Prof. O. T. Mason on ‘‘Abo-
riginal American Basketry: Studies in a Textile Art without Machinery ’’; one by
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, entitled ‘‘The Herpetology of Porto Rico’’; and one by Mr.
F. V. Coville, entitled ‘‘ Wokas—Primitive Food of the Klamath Indians.’’

Several papers by members of the Museum staff on material contained in the
Museum were, by permission of the Secretary, printed in various journals, and a
number were also published in the quarterly issue of the Miscellaneous Collections
of the Smithsonian Institution. ‘

The Annual Report for 1903, now ready to go to press, will have a paper by the
Assistant Secretary on the buildings occupied by the National Collections, and a
translation of the three papers by Dr. A. B. Meyer, director of the Royal Zoological
Anthropological-Ethnographical museums in Dresden, on the principal museums of
New York State, Chicago, and several European countries.

Tibrary.—The library of the National Museum has received asa gift from Prof.
Otis T. Mason, in addition to one made some years ago, about 2,000 pamphlets, sepa-
rates, and bound quarto volumes mostly on anthropological subjects, for which a
special bookplate has been provided. The Museum has also received from Dr.
Edward L. Greene his entire botanical library, which has been placed on deposit
for a period of ten years in connection with his botanical collections.

The aggregate of additions to the Museum library for the year amounted to 1,504
books, 3,187 pamphlets, and 700 parts of volumes.

Expositions.—The exhibits prepared by the Museum for the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition were properly arranged before the opening day, and the zeal and activity
displayed by the curators, preparators and others engaged in their preparation,
shipment, and installation are highly commendable. The collections are grouped
under the three general heads of anthropology, biology, and geology. A_ brief
account of them will be found in the Museum report for this year, while the official
- report of Dr. F. W. True, representative of the Institution and the National Museum,
will be published later.

Congress at its last session made provision for the celebration of the one hundredth
anniversary of the exploration of the Oregon region by Capts. Meriwether Lewis
and William Clark, including a Government exhibit, for which the sum of $200,000
was appropriated, besides $250,000 for a suitable building. The bill S. 276, intro-
duced by Senator John H. Mitchell on November 11, 1903, was approved by the
President on April 13, 1904.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the operations of the
Bureau of American Ethnology for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress making provisions for continuing researches
relating to the American Indians under the direction of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. The work has been carried out, with some minor modifications, in accordance
with plans of operations submitted, the first on June 11 and the second on Septem-
ber 26, and duly approved by the Secretary. The first plan provided for the month
of July only. The Smithsonian Institution was engaged in an examination into the
affairs of the Bureau, and until this was brought to a conclusion it was not regarded
as feasible to formulate plans for the year. The plan for July was extended to the
months of August and September, and on the 1st of October a plan of operations for
the remaining nine months of the year was submitted and duly approved by the
Secretary.

On July 31 Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge, tendered his resignation, which
was accepted, and the position of ethnologist in charge was discontinued.

The research work has been carried forward by a permanent force of eight
, scientific employees, and a number of temporary assistants have been engaged for
periods of varying lengths, both in the office and among the tribes. Field operations
were interfered with to some extent during the early months of the year, the presence
of the various ethnologists being required in the office in connection with the exami-
nation referred to above.

During the year five members of the staff prosecuted systematic researches in the
field, and the sections of the country visited by these and by special assistants include
Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Indian
Territory, and the West Indies. Mr. James Mooney was in the field eleven months,
Mrs. M. C. Stevenson nearly six months, Dr. J. W. Fewkes five months, Dr. John
R. Swanton six months, and Mr. H. H. St. Clair, 2nd, four months—a total of
thirty-two months.

The researches have dealt more or less directly with a large part of the anthropolog-
ical field, and more especially with the history and archeology of the pre-Columbian
tribes of the West Indies; with the social, religious, and esthetic activities of the
tribes of the Great Plains; with the mythology, social institutions, ceremonies, and
art of the Pueblo Indians; with the languages, mythology, and art of the Alaskan
tribes, and with the languages of certain vanishing tribal remnants dwelling in
northern California. The collecting of ethnological and archeological specimens
and of data relating thereto, especially in the field of symbolism as embodied in art,
has received special attention from the field workers.

The scientific researches and work carried on in the office were of exceptional
importance, particularly in connection with the preparation of a-cyclopedia of the
Indian tribes, the writing of a handbook of American languages, the compilation of
an archeological map of the United States, the study of visiting delegations of Indians,
and the preparation of exhibits for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The edi-
torial and library work, the cataloguing of manuscripts, the preparation of illustra-
tions, and the general clerical work have been carried forward in the usual manner.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

It was found impracticable, on account of the restricted resources of the Bureau, to
provide for all the branches of work referred to in the plan of operations for the
year. The transcription of the Motul Dictionary was not taken up, and the catalogu-
ing of books and photographic negatives*has not received the attention it deserves.
The lack ofa permanent force sufficient to cover all the ground was, however, com-
pensated for in part by the temporary employment of special expert help in direc-
tions where such help could be made most effective.

EXPOSITION WORK.

The preparation of an exhibit for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, begun dur-
ing the preceding year, was continued, and completed shortly after the opening of
the exposition in May. This work was under the personal supervision of the Chief,
who at the same time had charge of the preparation of an extensive exhibit for the
Department of Anthropology of the United States National Museum. The allot-
ment of $2,000, made by the Government Board for the Bureau exhibit, was too
small to warrant the assemblage of an extensive display; moreover, the space
assigned was extremely scant, and it was decided to confine the exhibit to illustra-
tions of the present field researches of the ethnological corps of the Bureau.

Seeking a subject that would be well within the range of the Bureau’s legitimate
field and yet susceptible of effective presentation by means of objective material, it
was decided to take up and illustrate as the chief topic the mythie symbolism of
various tribes as embodied in their decorative arts. Prominent among the concepts
thus embodied are the various forms of animal and plant life, clouds, lightning,
rain, sun, moon, and stars, as well as various monsters existing only in the imagina-
tion. These motives are interwoven with the thought and life of the people, and are
introduced freely into their various arts. The forms taken by them are exceedingly
varied, undergoing modifications with the different peoples, and taking distinct
forms in each art according to the nature and form of the object, the method
employed in execution, and the purpose in view.

In selecting the exhibits only the most important symbolic concepts of the tribes
represented were chosen, and for each of these concepts a group of exhibits was
assembled, consisting of a limited number of specimens of native workmanship in
carving, modeling, painting, and engraving, and a series of the native designs drawn
out in colors on a flat surface and associated with the specimens in the exhibit as a
means of further elucidating the strange modifications everywhere displayed.

The series of motives selected to illustrate the symbolic decoration of the Zunis
include the bird, the butterfly, the cornflower insect, the dragon fly, the serpent, the
frog and the tadpole, and the mountain lion; the human form and various monsters;
vegetable forms; and sundry cosmic phenomena, such as clouds, lightning, rain, sun,
moon, stars, and the planets. Doctor Swanton selected from the art of the Northwest
coast tribes a series of very interesting subjects, including the killer whale, the hawk,
the eagle, the thunderbird, and other monsters of the land and the sea. Doctor
Fewkes presented the very artistic symbolism of the ancient tribes of Tusayan in
series of illustrations, including the human form, the serpent, the mountain lion, the
frog and tadpole, the butterfly, the bird, the sunflower, and the heavenly bodies.

These exhibits were supplemented by a series of designs and objects selected by
Dr. Franz Boas to illustrate the varied symbolism associated with a given motive or
design by different tribes and peoples.

In addition to these systematic exhibits, two other important collections were pre-
sented. The archeological researches of Doctor Fewkes in the West Indies were
represented by a large series of typical relics of art in stone, bone, shell, wood, and
clay, selected from the extensive collections made during three winters’ research
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

among the islands. This series is without question the most complete yet brought
together to represent the pre-Columbian culture of the Carib and Arawak peoples,
who were practically exterminated by the Spanish invaders. Mr. Mooney, who is
engaged in the study of the heraldry system of the Great Plains tribes, undertook to
prepare a series of exhibits illustrating this heretofore undeveloped branch of
research. The exhibit consists of shields and models of shields and tipis embel-
lished with the heraldic symbols of the native owners, skins showing elaborate
designs in brilliant colors executed by native artists, and numerous other specimens
having a bearing on this phase of the culture of the Great Plains tribes.

The preparation of an extended exhibit for the National Museum gave the Chief
the opportunity of assembling a large series of exhibits illustrating the higher
achievements of the American race in various branches of art, including architecture,
sculpture, plastic art, carving, basketry, featherwork, and weaving. A leading fea-
ture of the work consisted of restorations of a number of the great ruined buildings
of Mexico and Yucatan. Five models of buildings were made: One on a scale of
one-twelfth, one on a scale of one-eighteenth, and three on a scale of one twenty-
fourth, and much time and research were expended in collecting data and in deter-
mining the details of construction and embellishment. Working plans for use in
the building of these models were prepared by Mr. De Lancey Gill, and the models
-were constructed by Mr. H. W. Hendley and Mr. W. H. Gill.

FIELD WORK.

Mr. James Mooney, ethnologist, remained in the field during nearly the entire fis-
cal year, dividing his time between the Kiowa and the Cheyenne, with their asso-
ciated tribes in western Oklahoma, in accordance with the existing joint agreement
between the Bureau and the Field Columbian Museum. The two tribes referred to
occupy adjoining reservations recently opened to white settlement, with agencies
about 100 miles apart.

During July, 1908, Mr. Mooney was operating chiefly in the Cheyenne camp,
spending a week in attendance at the great annual sun dance, where he succeeded
in obtaining the first photographs ever made of the skull-dragging ceremony, and
obtained for the National Museum the sacred buffalo skull used on the altar of
the dance. Shortly afterward he was recalled to Washington, where he remained
until October, returning to the field in time to witness the tomahawk dance of the
Arapaho—an interesting ceremony held only at intervals of several years on the
occasion of the promotion of the young men of a certain military society from a
lower to a higher degree. Headquarters having been temporarily established at
Darlington, the Cheyenne-Arapaho Agency, the winter months were spent in gath-
ering additional Cheyenne information and in putting the final touches on a series
of Kiowa models to be included in the Bureau’s exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. Early in March Mr. Mooney removed to his permanent headquarters
at Mount Scott, in the Kiowa country. Work was continued on the exposition
exhibit, which was shipped to St. Louis before the close of the month. About the
middle of June he was instructed to proceed to St. Louis to complete the installation
of this material; and, after spending a number of days 1n the study of the aboriginal
exhibits of the exposition, he returned to the Kiowa country to continue his
researches there.

Dr. J. W. Fewkes, ethnologist, remained in Washington during the first half of
the year, engaged in the completion of his report on the previous winter’s field work
in Porto Rico and Santo Domingo, and in January, 1904, he again proceeded to the
West Indies with instructions to make a reconnaissance of the great chain of islands
connecting Florida with the eastern shore of Venezuela for the purpose of obtaining
a general view of the antiquities and remaining tribal remnants. In January Doctor
Fewkes reached Cuba, where he spent six weeks examining local collections, espe-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

cially those in Havana and Santiago; he also visited Matanzas, Santa Clara, and Puerto
Principe, and made excursions from the city of Santiago to settlements where a few
Indians still lived. The small collections of prehistoric objects obtained in eastern
Cuba were found to resemble those of the neighboring island of Santo Domingo, but
to differ distinctly from those of the western extremity of the island. From Santiago
he proceeded by the way of Jamaica to Trinidad, where he remained three weeks
and gathered a small collection of archeological and ethnological objects and obtained
data regarding the former inhabitants of the island and the present condition of sur-
vivors now living in the town of Arima. Here he obtained some information regard-
ing the ‘‘fire walk,’’ or the ‘‘fire pass,’’ of the cooly residents of the island. From
Trinidad he proceeded along the Lesser Antilles to Porto Rico, remaining, respec-
tively, one or more days at Barbados, Grenada, St. Vincent, and St. Thomas, and
obtaining prehistoric objects at several of these islands.

March and April were mainly spent by Doctor Fewkes on the southern side of the
island of Porto Rico, visiting caves and shell heaps and other sites of prehistoric
occupation. Extensive shell heaps were found at Cayito, near Salinas, and at the
Coamo baths on the estate of Sefior Usera. Several caves showing evidence of former
occupation were found near Ponce. He purchased in Ponce the important collection
of Sefor Neumann, containing several stone collars, rare idols, complete pieces of pot-
tery, and other objects. The whole collection made by Doctor Fewkes, including
ethnological and archeological objects, numbers 630 specimens.

Since his return to Washington in May, Doctor Fewkes has been occupied with
the preparation of a final report of his expeditions to the West Indies during the last
three years.

Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, ethnologist, was engaged during the first six months of the year
in completing her monograph of the Zuni Indians and in preparing it for the press.
In January she set out for New Mexico with the view of continuing her researches
in certain directions, especially with respect to the relation of the Zuni people to
other tribes of the general region. Chief attention was given to the mythological
system and to the ceremonial dances, which followed in quick succession during the
late winter and the early spring months.

Mrs. Stevenson found the people of Zui much changed in recent years. The
former gentleness of character and the marked courtesy of the primitive aborigines
has entirely disappeared, save with a few of the older men and women, the desire
of sordid gain engendered by contact with the whites outweighing every other
motive.

Mrs. Stevenson was commissioned to collect material illustrative of her researches
in Zuni, to form part of the Bureau’s exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,
the special topic being the religious symbolism embodied in the various arts, such
as pottery, textiles, basketry, in costumes, altars, images, and other ceremonial objects.
Her study of this subject, heretofore much neglected, was thorough, and the signifi-
cance of nearly every symbol now used by the Zuni was obtained. She observed
that, while the officers of the secret fraternities have a thorough understanding of the
symbolism associated with their altars, few persons know the meanings of the designs
employed in pottery and the other useful arts, the artists themselves having little
appreciation of the poetic imagery associated with the various figures. Mrs. Steven-
son believes that the original significance of the decorative motives of the Zuni
people will soon be lost by them.

Aside from her systematic researches, a number of special subjects were investi-
gated by Mrs. Stevenson, including the irrigating system of the Zuni at Ojo Caliente,
the manufacture and use of the native dyeing materials, the preparation of pig-
ments, ete.

Karly in August Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, handed in a typewritten copy
of the Haida texts obtained at Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands, during the winter

sm 1904——4
5O REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of 1900-1901, with accompanying translations. Subsequently he was engaged in
copying and translating a second set of texts obtained at Masset, Queen Charlotte
Islands, during the same expedition.

On December 16 Doctor Swanton returned to the Northwest to engage in field work,
particularly among the Tlingit Indians of the Alaskan coast. From January 9 to
March 21 he was at Sitka among the northern Tlingit, and from then until May 5
among the southern members of that family. On the way thither he engaged in
some incidental work among the Haida, and during the season he collected about
one hundred Tlingit myths, as well as much ethnologic material in other branches.
One of Doctor Swanton’s main objects in this expedition was to define the relations
between the Haida and Tlingit peoples, looking to the possibility of a genetic rela-
tionship between them. A final conclusion on this point can not yet be given, but
it was discovered that many of the resemblances noted between the two languages
are due to an early residence of the Tlingit opposite the Haida on the coast now occu-
pied by the Tsimshian. This fact, aiready partially recognized, and now practically
demonstrated by Doctor Swanton, results in limiting the origin of much of the culture
on this coast to the immediate neighborhood of Hecate Strait, northern British
Columbia. An important contribution to the general subject of clan organization
was made by the discovery of a small Tlingit group which practiced marriage with
either of the two great clans.

Since his return to the office Doctor Swanton has been engaged, first, in revising
the Tlingit material for the Cyclopedia of Indian Tribes in the light of the fresh
information gained during his recent trip; and, second, in copying the texts taken
among the Tlingit.

Mr. H. H. St. Clair, 2nd, special assistant in Philology, visited northern California
and southern Oregon early in the year for the purpose of collecting data among the
Rogue River, Coos, and other small tribal remnants, of which a few individuals sur-
vive in that region, and a number of valuable vocabularies were secured.

OFFICE WORK.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, has continued the preparation and proof-reading
of part 1 of hismonograph on Iroquoian cosmology, which is to appear in the Twenty-
first Annual Report. The reading of the galleys of the interlinear translation and
the free translations into English of the Onondaga, the Seneca, and the Mohawk
versions of this cosmology occupied a large part of his time during the year. Exten-
sive revision was required on account of the premature transmission of the manuscript
to the printer in 1902. This caused much delay, but it was considered advisable
to permit the delay rather than to have the paper published in a form unsatisfactory
to the author.

As custodian of linguistic manuscripts, Mr. Hewitt, assisted by Miss Smedes, con-
tinued the work of revising and bringing up to date the card- catalogue of the lin-
guistic and other manuscripts in the archives of the Bureau. This card catalogue
was originally prepared in 1896-97 by Mr. Hewitt, with the assistance of the late
Rey. J. Owen Dorsey, and in this work the manuscripts were classified under three
main heads: First, the author or collector; second, the tribe or band-village; and
third, linguistic steck—all under one alphabet. The cross-reference catalogue of
the names of tribes and villages noted in the manuscripts is of very great use for
the purpose of comparison and research and for determining the number and distri-
bution of these manuscripts among the various stocks. In the present revision
the work consists in making a duplicate copy of the card descriptive of the manu-
script, which duplicate is pasted on the jacket or package containing the manuscript.
A number is affixed to the original card, to the duplicate, and to the manuscript
itself for the purpose of ready identification. New cards are being made for manu-
scripts acquired since the completion of the original catalogue in 1807. This scheme
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

has been applied to the manuscripts belonging to the Algonquian, the Athapascan,
and the Iroquoian stocks. The work on these stocks is far advanced. AI] the cards
of the original catalogue have been thus copied in duplicate.

Previous to the death of Maj. J. W. Powell, the late Director of this Bureau, the
linguistic material, chiefly Shoshonean, which was collected personally by him in the
field, was not placed in the archives of the office; but since that time this material
has been incorporated with that already contained in the archives. A part of this
material is still uneatalogued.

Mr. Hewitt has been called upon to do considerable work on the Iroquoian stock
for the Dictionary of Indian Tribes, and much of the correspondence of the Bureau
relating to linguistics has been placed in his hands.

During the year Dr. Cyrus Thomas, ethnologist, was engaged mainly on the Dic-
tionary of Indian Tribes, under the direction of Mr. F. W. Hodge. The work con-
sisted in preparing for final editing some of the families not finished at the com-
mencement of the year, in reexamining the cards which had been previously passed
over (to N) for the purpose of inserting any omitted titles and cross references, and in
taking general care of the Dictionary cards. During the early part of the year con-
siderable time was devoted by Doctor Thomas to the reading of final proofs of his
second paper on the Maya calendar systems, which is to appear in the Twenty-first
Annual Report.

Dr. A. S. Gatschet was engaged during the year in his linguistic work, mainly on
his Algonquian texts, and some advance has been made in the compilation of his
dictionary and grammar of the Peoria language. In addition, Doctor Gatschet has
been called upon for information in his particular field for correspondents of the
Bureau.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES AND WORK.

Under the direction of Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist of the Bureau, consid-
erable progress has been made in the preparation of the Handbook of American Lan-
guages. Doctor Boas has not been able to devote any great portion of his own time
to the work during the year, but it has been fully outlined, and a number of collabo-
rators have begun the preparation of special papers. The introductory chapters of
the work are assigned to Doctor Boas.

Mr. F. W. Hodge, of the Smithsonian Institution, has continued in charge of the
Cyclopedia of Indian Tribes, and substantial progress has been made in its compila-
tion. Much time has been consumed in revising and verifying the work of former
years and in bringing the whole up to a uniform standard of excellence. Mr. Hodge
has been assisted by Dr. Cyrus Thomas, ethnologist; Mr. Frank Huntington, edito-
rial assistant, and Mrs. Nichols, typewriter, and has received contributions from
numerous authors, including members of the Bureau and others intrusted with the
treatment of special topics. The Cyclopedia work has been delayed by the lack of
sufficient funds for the employment of skilled assistants.

Dr. Stewart Culin, of the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Artsand Sciences, has
completed and handed in his monograph on American Indian games, and this great
work was placed in the hands of the editor of the Bureau at the close of the year.

The plan of operations for the year included the provision that the Bureau should
undertake the preparation of a measure for the preservation of our national antiqui-
ties, for submission to Congress. The Institution had previously interested itself in
this subject, and in order that it might be prepared with a knowledge of what Gov-
ernments of other countries had done in this direction, it was determined to make a
study of the entire subject, and Mr. J. D. McGuire was temporarily employed to
make investigations and formulate a measure. This step was taken, and the measure
was in due course presented in the House and Senate. In prosecuting this work
translations were made of the laws of various countries, including Mexico, France,
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Germany, Italy, Sweden, Egypt, and Turkey, and others were thoroughly studied.
Mr. McGuire also compiled much material relating to governmental support of
anthropologic science in various countries. Later he took up and made much prog-
ress in the preparation of an archeological map of the United States, devoting his
attention chiefly to the middle Atlantic coast section.

Each year, especially during the winter season when Congress is in session, numer-
ous delegations of Indians visit Washington. It has been customary to have photo-
graphs made of members of these delegations in the Bureau laboratory, but hereto-
fore the work has not been systematized. As proposed in the plan of operations,
careful attention was given to this subject during the year. Mr. Andrew John, an
Iroquois Indian, resident in the city, was employed to interview and make the
acquaintance of all delegations on their arrival, with the view of conducting them to
the laboratories of the Bureau and the National Museum, where arrangements were
made to have measurements and photographs taken, and plaster masks also made
of all who were willing to submit to the process. In the absence of proper labora-
tories in the Bureau for all save the photographic work, the delegations were in the
main conducted to the laboratories of the National Museum, where every facility was
afforded. The results of the year’s work have been most satisfactory: One hundred
and ten 8 by 10 negatives were made by Mr. Smillie and his assistants; measurements
of 32 individuals were taken by Dr. AleS Hrdli¢ka in the Physical Laboratory; and
masks of 20 individuals were made by Mr. William Palmer. The following is a list
of the principal delegations, with the numbers conducted to the laboratories in each
case:

COLLECTIONS.

The collections of ethnological and archeological specimens made during the year
are exceptionally important. A special effort was made to obtain material for the
purpose of illustrating the researches of the Bureau at the Louisiana Purchase Exposi-
tion. Valuable additions along this line were obtained by Doctor Fewkes in the West
Indies, by Mrs. Stevenson in the Pueblo country, by Doctor Swanton in Alaska and
British Columbia, and by Mr. Mooney in Oklahoma and Indian Territory. Seven
hundred and seventy-eight specimens have been transferred to the National Museum,
and such of these as were required for the purpose were sent to the exposition.
Other collections were forwarded directly to the exposition and have not been
transferred.

In order that collections made by the Bureau may receive immediate attention
with respect to preservation from moths and other insects, and with the view of
having them properly and promptly catalogued, they are, on arrival in Washington,
placed in the hands of the head curator of anthropology of the National Museum,
who has at hand all necessary facilities for preservation and record. It is understood,
however, that these collections are at all times to be at the disposal of the Bureau for
purposes of study and illustration. In all, about 1,000 specimens, mostly of excep-
tional value, have been acquired during the year.

ILLUSTRATIONS,

The work of the illustrations division remained in charge of Mr. De Lancey Gill.
Illustrations for two annual reports—the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth—and for
Bulletin 28 were edited and prepared for transmittal to the Public Printer; 137
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Bae

drawings for the illustration of these volumes were made, and 900 engravings for the
same were examined and necessary corrections indicated. In the photographic

branch of the work, wherein Mr. Gill was assisted, as heretofore, by Mr. Henry

Walther, 166 negatives were taken, 132 films exposed in the field were developed,
and 1,373 prints were made.

Mr. Gill was also called upon to assist in preparing exhibits for the Louisiana Pur-
chase Exposition, and made during the year detailed plans required in the construc-
tion of models of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque, and the Castillo at Chiche-
nitza, and also of two models illustrating in actual dimensions the remarkable
sculptural embellishments characteristic of the ancient Mayan architecture.

PUBLICATIONS.

The Twentieth Annual Report and Part I of the Twenty-second have been issued
during the year, the former in March and the latter in May, 1904. The Twenty-first
and Part II of the Twenty-second are in press. The Twenty-third was submitted
for publication on February 23, and Bulletin 28 was sent to the Public Printer on
March 31, 1904.

Publications are sent to two classes of recipients: First, regularly, without special
request, to working anthropologists, public libraries, scientific societies, institutions
of learning, and to other persons or institutions able to contribute to the work of the
Bureau publications, ethnologic specimens, or desirable data; second, to other per-
sons or institutions in response to special requests, usually indorsed by members
of Congress. During the year 1,946 copies of the Twentieth Annual Report have
been sent to regular recipients, and 2,500 miscellaneous volumes and pamphlets have
been distributed in response to about an equal number of special requests. More
than 250 of these requests have come through Congressmen, and about 500 volumes
have been sent in response. One hundred and fifteen copies of Part I of the, Twenty-
second Annual Report have been sent out.

EDITORIAL WORK.

Mr. Herbert 8. Wood has had charge of the editorial work during the year, being
assisted in several instances by Dr. Elbert J. Benton, Mr. E. G. Farrell (courteously
detailed for the work by the Government Printing Office), and Mr. William Bar-
num. The editorial work for the year has consisted chiefly in the reading of proofs
of the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Annual Reports, and the preparation for
printing of the Twenty-third Annual Report.

LIBRARY.

At the time of the removal of the Bureau of American Ethnology from the United
States Geological Survey building in 1893, the volumes belonging to the Bureau num-
bered about 2,500. Through exchange and purchase the growth of the library has
been, on the whole, satisfactory. The library now contains 12,165 bound volumes,
about 6,500 pamphlets, and a large number of periodicals. In the purchase of books
care has been used to add only such works as bear on the subject of anthropology
with special reference to the American Indians, although volumes relating to kin-
dred subjects are received through exchange.

The accessions for the year number 302 bound volumes, about 500 pamphlets, and
the regular issues of more than 500 periodicals.

CLERICAL WORK.

The clerical work of the Bureau has been intrusted largely to Mr. J. B. Clayton,
who on June 1, 1904, with the approval of the Civil Service Commission, received
the designation of head clerk. Mr. Clayton has had personal charge of the financial
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

work of the Bureau, including the purchase of supplies and the preparation of
accounts.

The clerica! work during the year included the registration and cataloguing of
letters, the preparation of replies to letters, and the keeping of miscellaneous records.
The method described in the report for the previous year as having been adopted
has been employed during this year, and the clerical work of the Bureau is kept
up to date. Aga rule, letters are answered the same day that they are received, and
it is only where technical information is called for that there is any delay what-
ever. The letters in regard to publications, finances, field work, and miscellaneous
information cover 2,835 pages in the press-copy letter books.

Miss E. R. Smedes has given excellent service in connection with the general cor-
respondence of the Bureau. The clerical work in the Library has been satisfactorily
attended to by Miss Ella Leary.

The very considerable work involved in the care and distribution of publications
has been in charge of Miss May 8S. Clark, who has efficiently met the Bureau’s needs
in this direction.

Mrs. F. 8. Nichols was certified by the Civil Service Commission for temporary
work in connection with the Dictionary of Indian Tribes, and Misses Postley, Stratton,
and Taliaferro were employed for brief periods in the same work.

PROPERTY.

The property of the Bureau is comprised in seven classes, as follows:

Office furniture and appliances.

Field outfits.

Ethnological manuscripts and other documents.

Photographs, drawings, paintings, and engravings.

A working library.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
SERVICE.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report relating to the operations of
the International Exchange Service during the year ending June 30, 1904:

The term ‘‘International Exchanges’? has been applied by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution almost since its foundation to the interchange of its publications for those of
scientific societies and establishments in foreign countries. A liberal distribution of
the works published at the expense of the Smithson fund was one of the principal
means adopted in the early plans of the Institution for administering that part of
the bequest of its founder relating to the ‘‘diffusion of knowledge among men.”’

In order to carry out a systematic exchange of large quantities of books it was nec-
essary to enlist the cooperation of institutions and individuals in the populous centers
of the world, and as it became known that such arrangement existed, first one then
another society and finally the United States Government asked the Smithsonian
Institution to perform a similar service in exchanging its publications, until the
expense became a heavy tax on the income of the Institution.

In 1881 Congress made a small appropriation to the Smithsonian Institution in aid
of the Exchange Service, and has since continued to make an annual appropriation,
though at no time has it been sufficient to cover the extire expense of the service,
consequently the Institution has been obliged to request a partial reimbursement of
the pro rata expense from Federal and State institutions.

Nearly 159,000 packages were dispatched during the yearended June 30, 1904, each
of which was credited to the contributor and debited to the recipient. A recapitula-
tion was also made, showing the aggregate contributions and receipts by each country.
This necessary detail, in addition to the routine work of receiving and dispatching
parcels, requires the continuous service of fifteen employees. The work requires the
exclusive use of five rooms, which are arranged along the south basement of the Smith-
sonian building. These rooms, though originally remodeled and arranged expressly
for the exchange service, have since been enlarged to some extent, but at times, when
exchanges are received in unusual quantities, it is necessary temporarily to occupy
adjoining rooms and hallways.

Aside from packing materials the supplies required are those necessary to a well-
regulated office and for the greater part are procured under annual Government
contracts.

Two instances have been reported during the year of loss or damage to exchange
parcels in transit. One case, No. 414, for China, was subjected to the process of
‘general average’’ on account of damage to the steamship St. Bede, but a full report
has not yet been submitted.

A case containing United States Government documents (designated as No. 90 of
the official set), destined for the Parliamentary Library, Hobart, Tasmania, was
destroyed while en route from London to Hobart, but most of the publications were
fortunately duplicated.

The following tables describe the operations of the service during the year, and in
comparison with the preceding year show a gain of 8,766 packages, or a total of
158,983, being an increase of 6,183 in the number sent abroad and an increase of 2,583
received from other countries. On the other hand, the total weight of exchanges

transmitted was less by 14 per cent. This inconsistency in figures was due to a pre-
ponderance of unusually large packages forwarded abroad during the year ended
June 30, 1903, but the greater number of parcels during the last year shows an
increased interest in the service and has resulted in adding several thousand names
to the list of correspondents.

It is gratifying to note that of the weight of exchanges handled during the year
ended June 30, 1904, 75 per cent was from domestic sources and 25 per cent from
abroad, while during the previous year the proportions were 73.8 per cent and 26,2
per cent, respectively.

In July, 1897, an exchange list of foreign institutions was published which con-
tained 9,414 addresses. The necessity for a revised list arising, a new edition was
published in September, 1903, containing 12,720 addresses. This list, printed in
limited edition at the expense of the Smithsonian Institution, is intended as a work-
ing guide for the United States International Exchange Service and its distributing
agencies throughout the world, rather than for general distribution.

EXCHANGE OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.

(eda |

The following table represents the exchange transmissions for the several Depart-
ments and Bureaus of the Government during the year, showing a total of 16,235
packages received from abroad, and 74,863 packages sent to other countries, being
an increase over the previous year of 29.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively.

Although still so far less than this Government’s contributions, the receipts from
abroad during the year show a substantial increase and it is believed mark the
beginning of new activity on the part of other governments in reciprocating for
the donations which have been made for so many years through the Smithsonian

Institution.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

In the main the same arrangements for distributing exchanges in other countries
have continued during the year as have existed in the past. But one change requires
special notice. I refer to the death at Leipzig-Gohlis, on February 6, 1904, of Dr.
Jarl Felix Alired Fliigel, in his eighty-fourth year.

Doctor Fligel succeeded his father in 1855 as agent of the Smithsonian Institution
for the kingdoms and principalities which now constitute the German Empire, and
continued in that capacity until his death, a continuous service of forty-nine years.

His long term of office gave Doctor Fligel an exceptional opportunity to further
the work of the International Exchange Service throughout central Europe, of which
he never failed to take advantage.

Doctor Fligel published numerous pamphlets and critical essays on the English
language, and was the author of the standard work extensively known as Fligel’s
Dictionary of the English and German languages, which reached its fifteenth edition
in1891. The Institution deeply regrets his loss.

Mr. W. Irving Adams, chief clerk of the International Exchange Service, was in
Leipzig on official business at the time of the death of Doctor Flugel and took imme-
diate steps to recommend the selection of his successor in order that the work of the
agency should suffer as little inconvenience as possible. The long and_ faithful
service, the scholarly attainments, and wide acquaintance of Doctor Fliigel made the
selection of a suitable person a not inconsiderable task; but after careful inquiry Mr.
Adams selected Mr. Karl W. Hiersemann, the bookseller of Leipzig, as Doctor
Fliigel’s successor, and on March 8, 1904, the Secretary approved the selection by
tendering Mr. Hiersemann the appointment. The central location of Mr. Hierse-
mann’s establishment and his efficient clerical staff have already shown the selection
to have been a fortunate one.

The progress of diplomatic negotiations between the United States and China with
a view of establishing mutual exchange relations have frequently been referred to in
the annual reports of the Exchange Service, and I am now pleased to announce that
the matter has been referred by the Chinese department of foreign affairs to the
superintendent of trade for the south (Nanking viceroy), with authority to deal with
it. It would therefore seem that official exchange relations with China more nearly
approach consummation than ever before. Meanwhile only occasional publications
are received from China by mail, and no provision exists for sending exchanges from
the United States to China except to addresses in Shanghai.

The indirect method of forwarding parcels to the West Indies through the Crown
agents for the colonies in London has been abolished, and the services of colonial
officers and educational institutions in several of the islands have been enlisted
instead. In the near future it is hoped that similar arrangements will be perfected
with other British colonies.

The department of foreign affairs, Bangkok, Siam, has accepted the invitation of
the Institution to enter into a mutual arrangement for an exchange of publications,
both governmental and scientific.

Following is a list of correspondents abroad through which the distribution of
exchanges is accomplished. Those in the larger and in many of the smaller coun-
tries forward to the Smithsonian Institution reciprocal contributions for distribution
in the United States.

68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

As new countries are constantly being added, the sets for the depositories desig-
nated under the last resolution are not forwarded simultaneously with those originally
provided, but are delivered to the Institution from the Library of Congress and are
dispatched with the next succeeding consignments of miscellaneous exchanges.

Messrs. William Wesley & Son and Dr. Joseph yon Kordsy continue to represent
the Institution in Great Britain and Hungary, respectively, but, as above mentioned,
a new agent, in the person of Mr. Karl W. Hiersemann, has been appointed to suc-
ceed the late Doctor Fliigel in Germany. To these gentlemen, who are compensated
by the Institution for their services, to the many individuals and institutions who
render valuable aid in the promotion of the exchange service at large, and to Mr.
Charles A. King, deputy collector of the port of New York, the grateful acknowledg-
ments of the Smithsonian Institution are due.

Mr. W. Irving Adams, chief clerk of the International Exchange Service, returned
on May 30, 1904, from a journey to Europe, undertaken for the purpose of promoting
the interest of the service. It gives me pleasure to say that his observations will
result in enlarging the scope of the Exchange Service and in inaugurating many
improvements.

Permit me to commend the efficient manner in which the work of the Exchanges
has been conducted by the office force under the immediate supervision of Mr. Adams,
and, in his absence, under Mr. F. V. Berry. The increased work of the service,
brought about by its growing usefulness, has sometimes been almost overwhelming,
nevertheless there has been no undue delay in the transmission and distribution of
the many thousands of packages handled and recorded during the year.

Respectfully submitted.

F. W. Hones,
Acting Curator of Exchanges.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The cost for purchase, collection, and transportation of these accessions has been
$4,500.

The appropriation for the general service of the park was made in the following
terms:

‘For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage
and drainage; and for grading, planting, and otherwise improving the grounds;
erecting and repairing buildings and inclosures; care, subsistence, purchase, and
transportation of animals, including salaries or compensation of all necessary employ-
ees, the purchase of necessary books and periodicals, the printing and publishing of
operations, not exceeding one thousand five hundred copies, and general incidental
expenses not otherwise provided for, ninety-five thousand dollars.’’

70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

For some years past the want of sufficient accommodations for the animals at the
park has been severely felt. This need seemed during the past season so urgent that
all other objects not imperatively necessary for the maintenance of the collection
were deferred, and the available resources were applied to the erection of a new
house for mammals.

After consultation with Mr. F. L. Olmsted a site for the structure was selected
near the principal animal house, in the situation shown in the accompanying plat
(Pl. 1). It was decided to build it of stone, using the same gray gneiss, found in the
region of Rock Creek, that was used in building the principal house. A plan of the
main floor of the structure is shown herewith (Pl. II). Its dimensions are as follows:

On reference to the accompanying plan it will be seen that the cages for the ani-
mals are arranged so as to be accessible from both front and rear. Small movable
passageways will connect these inner cages with those to be constructed about the
exterior of the building, stretching in each case across the service passage in the
rear. The building will be lighted almost wholly by skylights, situated over the
‘ages, so that the animals are in full light while the public is in comparative
obscurity.

A contract was made for the walls of this building February 5, 1904. These walls
were completed June 15, 1904, at a cost of $6,578. Other contracts have been made
as follows:

Korithe structuraliironworkeses =o ee see ee eee ees $7, 662
For thie stile sroo bese Sa re ea ek re a en ere 4, 495

It is hoped that the iron work will be completed by October 31, 1904, and the
tiling about a month later.

It is estimated that the total cost of the building will be about $40,000.

Fitttng up old elephant house.—To supply temporarily the accommodations so
badly needed for small mammals, the barn formerly occupied by the elephant was
repaired and fitted up for this class of animals. It furnishes 23 cages. This cost $500.

New boiler in antelope house-—The heating boiler in the antelope house was one
which had previously served for some years in the Smithsonian Institution building.
At the close of the winter of 1902-3 it was found to be so badly corroded that it could
no longer be used. A new vertical boiler was put in at a cost of $250.

New inclosure for buffaloes.—The buffalo paddocks on the steep northeastern slope
of the narrow valley of Rock Creek were not sanitary. Asa herd from Messrs. Cody
and Bailey was accepted on deposit, it was necessary to construct a new inclosure on
the hill near the Connecticut Avenue entrance. This was fenced with the posts and
woven-wire fencing from the old paddocks, the cost of the paddock and shelter being
$500.

New raccoon tree.—The large tulip poplar, which had been occupied by the raccoons
for a number of years, finally died. It was not in good condition when the park was
established, and a heavy fill of earth had been made oyer its roots. To replace this
a large oak was moved during the winter, and a new fence was built. This cost $500.

Repair and alteration of Adams Mill road.—The portion of Adams Mill road from the
foot of the hill to the log bridge was in bad shape from irregular settling. During

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 71

the summer of 1903 the crown was reformed and a new surface dressing of crushed
limestone was put on at a cost of $450. (This section of road is still in almost perfect
condition, a good example of the ease with which a comparatively level road can be
kept in repair as against one on a steep grade. )

This road was also widened at the entrance and reshaped to conform to the new
lines of the highway approach outside. Cost, $260.

Repairing log bridge.—It was found that the floods in the creek had cut into and
undermined the north abutment of this bridge, and additional concrete was put in
and faced with stone slabs. The trend of the current against the abutment was pre-
vented for the future by removing a gravel bank and burying a few logs in the edge
of the stream to turn the water toward the center and prevent scouring. Cost, $250.

Water supply from the inain on Connecticut avenue extended.—The water supply for
the entire park had been furnished by a 6-inch main, laid at the expense of the park,
down Quarry road from Columbia road. The supply in the higher parts of the park,
on the west side, was not satisfactory, and it was impossible to maintain sufficient
pressure when water was being used in the lower levels. A new pipe to supply the
western part of the park was laid from the main on Connecticut avenue extended,
at a cost of $250.

Bookcases for office.—Reference books and bookcases for the superintendent’s
office were purchased during the year at a cost of $200.

Noteworthy accessions.—A young male lion, presented to the President by King
Menelik, of Abyssinia, was deposited in the park by the President. A spotted hyena,
presented by N. E. Skinner, special envoy to King Menelik. Twelve American bison
were loaned by Messrs. Bailey and Cody. One phalanger and 2 bridled wallabies
were received from Dr. F. W. Goding, United States consul at Newcastle, New South
Wales. Four coyotes were presented by Major Pitcher, acting superintendent, Yel-
lowstone National Park. Nine wandering tree ducks were presented by Carl Hagen-
beck. One Himalayan bear was received from the New York Zoological Park in
exchange.

Purchases.—A Kodiak bear. (This species is the largest carnivorous land animal
now in existence; one killed at English Bay, Kodiak Island, weighed 1,756 pounds. )
In this connection it is of interest to note that the male of Ursus dalli gyas, now-in
the park, which weighed in June, 1903, 450 pounds, had attained a weight, January
18, 1904, of 625 pounds. A Mexican mountain sheep. <A pair of yearling moose
obtained in Manitoba. A pair of jaguars. A male Bactrian camel, procured as a
mate for the female already in the collection. A California condor. A female black
bear, from the Province of Quebec; an unusually fine specimen, weighing 380 pounds.

Births.—Kight wild turkeys hatched in the park. Brown pelican, sandhill crane,
and Canada goose also nested, and the emu laid two eggs.

Important losses.—Two American bison, gastro-enteritis. One pair moose. One
American antelope. Mule deer—3 from disease, 2 from fright by buffalo, 1 female
killed by amale. Two jaguars—intense catarrhal inflammation throughout intestinal
tract; virulent colon germs found, pathogenic to rabbits and guineapigs. One puma.
Black bear—pneumonia, 2; gastro-enteritis from Ascaris transfuga, 2. One grizzly
bear, gastro-enteritis with nephritis; in the collection since June, 1888. One sun
bear, from gastro-enteritis. One Japanese bear, shock from cutting claws. Four
Arctic foxes, no intestinal worms found; they were found in subsequent cases. Two
European flamingoes, Tropidocerca (a nematode worm found in subsequent cases)
producing fatal inflammation of the digestive tract. One cassowary from serous
pericarditis.

A considerable number of monkeys, birds (parrots, ete.), and snakes died from
results of overcrowding or lack of proper quarters.

The post-mortem examinations were made by the Bureau of Animal Industry, to
whose courtesy the thanks of the park are due.

72 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Exchange with New Zealand government.—The New Zealand government arranged,
through the President, to obtain elk from the herd in the National Zoological Park
in exchange for other animals. Ten elk are to be sent, and will be forwarded in the
autumn of 1904, after the horns are hard and the young have been weaned.

Readjustment of boundaries.—The desirability of having the park bordered by high-
ways along the eastern and western sides has been urged at various times and brought
to the attention of Congress. A bill for the establishment of highways adjacent to
the park was submitted by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia during the
session of 1903-4, and passed as given below:

“AN ACT For the opening of connecting highways on the east and west sides of the zoological park,
District of Columbia.

‘*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, That within six months after the passage of this act the Com-
missioners of the District of Columbia be, and they are hereby, authorized and
directed to institute in the supreme court of the District of Columbia, sitting as a
district court, by petition, particularly describing the lands to be taken, a proceeding
in rem to condeinn the land that may be necessary for connecting the north end of
Adams Mill road in Lanier Heights with south end of Park road in Ingleside by a
highway fifty feet wide along or near the eastern boundary of the zoological park,
also for connecting Cathedral avenue with Klingle road by a highway fifty feet wide
along or near the western boundary of the zoological park, all in accordance with
plans on file in the office of the Engineer Commissioner, District of Columbia.’’? Public
act, April 28, 1904.

The estimates for the park for the year 1904-5, as submitted to Congress, contained
the following item:

‘‘Readjustment of boundaries, National Zoological Park: Acquirement of the
tract of land lying between the present eastern boundary of the National Zoological
Park and the new highway to be established by the District of Columbia from
Adams Mill road to Kenesaw avenue, and also of the tract lying between the present
western boundary of said park and ‘the new highway to be established by the Dis-
trict of Columbia from Cathedral avenue to Klingle road, sixty thousand dollars;
and said land, when acquired, to becomea part of the National Zoological Park.”’

Congress took no action upon this estimate.

Exhibit at Louisiana Purchase Exposition.—In view of the importance of bringing
before the general public the aims and objects of the park it was thought proper to
prepare an exhibit of some extent for the Louisiana Purehase Exposition. This
consisted of a display of living birds confined in a flying cage occupying a ground
space of 84 by 228 feet, and from 50 to 55 feet in height. It was constructed by the
St. Paul Foundry Company, according a plans prepared by the Supervising Architect
of the Treasury Department after preliminary sketches furnished by the park. The
cost of the cage was about $15,000. Its frame consists of light steel arches, covered
by a wire netting with three-fourths-inch mesh. A longitudinal partition divides
the cage into two parts, and a passage for the public 14 feet wide extends from end
to end.

One side is occupied mainly by marsh and water birds and has two swimming pools,
each from 50 to 60 feet long. The other side is occupied mainly by song birds and
small species noted for bright plumage, and has two smaller pools with a streamlet
of water trickling from one to the other, a distance of 90 feet, through a series of
small, shallow basins that afford drinking and bathing places for the little birds.
This side includes several moderate-sized growing trees which were left in their
natural situation. Besides these, many small trees and shrubs were planted and the
surface was sodded. The cage was located in a natural grove of trees not far from
the Government building in the exposition grounds. All ground improvements,
including water supply, ete., were furnished by the exposition company at its own
expense.

The cost of stocking and maintaining the cage was defrayed from the Government

exhibit fund. Birds were purchased from dealers and collectors, but, as it was
desirable to have as many as possible already accustomed to such confinement, a
considerable number were supplied from the stock in the National Zoological Park.
A head keeper and one underkeeper were employed during the month of May and
another underkeeper during June.

It is expected that at the close of the exposition the cage will be brought to Wash-
ington and ultimately erected in the National Zoological Park.

APPENDIX V.

REPORT OF THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1904.

Sir: The kinds and amounts of Observatory property are approximately as follows:

Buildings oie s =. i.e oles Sens phe ee ne ore $6, 300
A PParatui so 2 joes ico ad sears Sees Scere ere a era ee ert She eee ee 41, 400

Potall. 22,005 sca ctros.cen ee hee es Se ee ee ee ee 54, 500

During the past year the acquisitions of property have been as follows:

(a) Apparatus.—Astronomical and physical apparatus has been purchased at an
expenditure of $4,500. The most important pieces comprise a new spectrobolometric
outfit, to be used in the study of the great solar image of the 140-foot focus horizon-
tal telescope, and also for a proposed expedition to some elevated station for the
determination of the solar constant. Of the sum expended for apparatus, $2,430 was
chargeable to the appropriations of 1901-2 and 1902-3. Shelters for the great hori-
zontal telescope and apparatus for the research on the solar constant have been
ordered, at an estimated expenditure of $1,280. A ground plan of the Observatory
enclosure, including the new shelters, is shown in Plate Y.

(b) Library and records.—The usual periodicals have been continued, and a few
books of reference purchased. Three new cases have been procured for storage of
books and periodicals. The total expenditure for these purposes is $340.

The Observatory buildings have been repainted at a cost of $195. No losses of
property worthy of note have occurred during the year.

THE WORK OF THE OBSERVATORY.

For convenience the work may be classified as follows:
1. Publications and miscellaneous matters.

2. Improvements of apparatus.

3. Investigations.

1. Publications and miscellaneous matters.

Eclipse report.—The report of the solar eclipse expedition to Wadesboro, N. C., of
May, 1900, referred to in my last year’s report, has been distributed, and has been
favorably noticed both in this country and abroad.

St. Louis Exposition.—A far more elaborate exhibition of the Observatory work
than usual has been prepared and installed for the St. Louis Exposition under your
instructions. The great coelostat, mentioned in my last year’s report, is arranged to
throw a beam of sunlight into a darkened portion of the room occupied by the
Observatory exhibit, where a solar image about a yard in diameter is thrown up by
a 6-inch telescope, and the solar spectrum is formed upon the walls of the room by a
large concave grating.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

A display of transparencies showing apparatus, buildings, and results of observa-
tion isa prominent object to visitors as they enter the room, and thence they pass
through the darkened chamber above mentioned and get a view of the solar spec-
trum and of such sun spots as are visible. As they leave the darkened chamber they
come upon a group of bolometric apparatus in actual operation and sensitive enough
to give 100 or more scale divisions deflection when the visitor holds his hand in
front of the bolometer. Charts and reports illustrative of the work of the Observa-
tory are found upon the walls. A large number of copies of a pamphlet descriptive
of the Observatory and its studies have been freely distributed.

2. Improvements of apparatus.

Bolometer.—The bolometer and its adjuncts had reached so high a state of perfec-
tion, as described in my last year’s report, that further improvement could hardly be
expected, but in order to make it practicable to set up so sensitive an instrument at
the St. Louis Exposition and leave it without expert attention for months, it was felt
desirable to combine in compact form the most approved methods of construction,
having special reference to simplicity of manipulation, so that the instrument could
be safely left in unskilled hands. Accordingly the bolometric apparatus, shown in
Plate VI, was designed at the Observatory and constructed in the Observatory shop.

Asin the form shown in Plate XII A of Volume I of the Annals of the Astro-
physical Observatory, all the adjuncts to the bolometer, excepting the battery and
galvanometer, are combined ina single case, adjusted mechanically from outside, but
in this new form the adjusting slide wires are straight, instead of spiral, and no
clamping mechanism is required, so that the construction is much simplified and can
hardly get out of order. At the same time five slide wires are provided of differing
sensitiveness of adjustment, so that by merely turning cranks on the outside of the
case any adjustment from 45 to spoodoo00 1M the relative resistances of the balancing
arms of the bolometric circuit can be easily effected. It is a principal advantage of
this arrangement that all the electrical circuit is in such compact quarters that
changes of temperature affect all parts almost alike. These have been the great causes
of disturbance of the deflections of the needle in the past, and the great obstacle to
an automatic registry. Their bad effects are so nearly eliminated now that apart
from the occasional need of a uniformity in the temperature of the prism, the
elaborate arrangements for keeping a uniform temperature in the observing room are
no longer needed. No difficulty from drift or any disorder has ever been experienced
with this adjunct to the bolometric apparatus, and it is so much superior to any
earlier form that a duplicate piece has since been constructed for use in a research
on the radiation of the stars. Both were made at the Observatory shop and worked
perfectly from the very first trial, and they reflect great credit on Mr. Kramer, the
instrument maker.

Pyrheliometer.—Reference was made in last year’s report to the new form of absolute
pyrheliometer then being developed, consisting of a hollow chamber or ‘‘absolutely
black body” in which the radiation is absorbed and from which the heat is continu-
ously removed by a liquid circulating about’ the walls of the chamber. This instru-
ment has been tried so successfully in an experimental form that steps are now being
taken to provide one for continuous automatic registration of the rate of solar radia-
tion. Its principal advantage as an absolute instrument depends on the fact that it
may be demonstrated that its indications are correct, for if a known quantity of heat
is supplied electrically to a coil within the chamber, this heat will reach the walls by
convection and radiation, and being then removed by the flowing liquid its amount
may be measured and compared with the known heating actually produced in the
coil. But it is obvious that the heat of solar rays, absorbed almost wholly upon the
wall of the chamber as they fall upon it, is much more likely to be accurately meas-
ured than the heat of the coil, which must first be chiefly communicated to the air

and thence to the wall of the chamber by convection. Accordingly, if the measured
heating from the coil agrees closely with the known heating apy lied to the coil,
much more closely will the measured heating from the solar rays represent the actual
rate of solar radiation.

Repeated trials have showed that the new form of pyrheliometer is capable of
accurate measurement of the heating of the coil, so that confidence is felt in its meas-
ures of the more advantageously applied solar radiation. Preliminary comparisons
with the new instrument seem to indicate that the mercury pyrheliometer hereto-
fore used as a standard at this Observatory reads somewhat too high.

Horizontal telescope.—Tests have been made to determine how completely the defects
of bad seeing are removed by churning the air column in the great horizontal tele-
scope, according to the plan initiated by you and mentioned in my last year’s report.
It has been found that though the churning is of great advantage, and generally indis-
pensable to any work whatever on the solar image, yet the definition of an artificial
star, whose beam travels twice through the whole tube, is far from perfect even with
churning. Much of the disturbed seeing is found to be caused by the heating of the
poorly protected tube in the sun, and a ventilated canvas tent has been ordered to
screen the tube thoroughly. . Plans are also formed for making additional tests on
other methods of churning the air in the tube. Recalling the more perfect results
secured in experiments on a smaller scale in 1902, and the evident improvement of
definition obtained in the present large tube with the churning device now installed,
no doubt is felt that bad seeing within the tube itself may at length be wholly
removed.

A second serious defect in definition was found to be caused by warping of the
large plane mirrors of the coelostat, one of which is inclined forward and was at first
supported by a ring in front, while the other mirror, made originally for much less
severe work, was too thin to keep flat with an ordinary system of support. Both
mirrors have been almost entirely cured of these defects by the introduction of the
Ritchey supporting system composed of numerous balanced plates. For the mirror
which is inclined forward, Mr. Ritchey’s original design had to be somewhat modi-
fied because the mirror must be stuck to the plates instead of resting on them by its
weight as in mirrors supported face up. We have heretofore employed here ground
brass plates to which the mirror is stuck with rubber cement, but it would probably
be better to make the plates slightly concave and connect them by flexible tubes to
a large reservoir from which the air is partially exhausted, so that the mirror would
be held to the plates by suction. But even as we have used it, the Ritchey system
has wonderfully improved the definition secured on the solar image. All the work
on these support systems was done in the Observatory shop.

A third serious defect in the definition of the horizontal telescope is due to the
tremor of the mirrors continually kept up by the city traffic, notwithstanding the
costly and massive piers on which the apparatus rests. Very great improvement in
steadiness has come from placing 14-inch rubber blocks under the coelostat and
under the concave mirrors.

Before the improvements noted, the solar focal image, 40 cm. in diameter, was an
ill-defined circle at a focal distance varying often 10 feet during a single day, and with
the sides at different focal distances from the top and bottom. Now the image is
pretty sharply defined, comes to focus on all sides in the same plane, and stays within
less than a foot of the same focus all day; while its wanderings rarely reach much
over a millimeter in amplitude. It is now possible to observe the absorption in the
solar envelope with accuracy at within 1 or 2 per cent of the radius from the sun’s
limb. But further improvements of the horizontal telescope are in progress, notably
the provision of well-protected shelters over the coelostat, the concave mirror, and

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81

the spectro-bolometric apparatus, in place of the canvas shelters thus far used, and
with these, the improved churning device proposed, and the tent to shelter the tube
already ordered, it is confidently expected to have the horizontal telescope in very
satisfactory condition during the coming fiscal year.

3. Investigations.

Sun’s possible variability. —Notable progress has been made with the researches you
have initiated on the amount of solar radiation and its absorption in the solar envel-
ope and in our atmosphere. Within the last seventeen months three independent
kinds of evidence have been collected here, pointing toward the conclusion that the
radiation supplied by the sun may perhaps fluctuate within intervals of a few months
through ranges of nearly or quite 10 per cent, and ‘that these fluctuations of solar
radiation may cause changes of temperature of several degrees centigrade nearly
simultaneously over the great continental areas of the world. Further evidence
must, however, be awaited to verify this important conclusion.

The three kinds of evidence referred to are as follows: First, on all favorable days
the ‘‘solar constant’’ of radiation outside our atmosphere has been determined here,
and changes of about 10 per cent in the values obtained have been found which can
not be attributed to known causes. Second, the solar image formed by the horizon-
tal telescope has been examined with the spectro-bolometer to determine the absorp-
tion of radiation within the solar enyelope itself. If we grant for argument’s sake
that the rate of solar radiation outside our atmosphere fluctuates rapidly from time
to time, then as you have observed, the cause of this fluctuation can not reasonably
be a variability of the temperature of so immense a body as the sun itself, but must
rather be in a change in the absorption of a more or less opaque envelope surrounding
thesun. Accordingly the two researches I have mentioned are intimately associated,
for if we find a considerable increase in the rate of solar radiation outside our atmos-
phere we ought to find a corresponding decrease in the absorbing power of the solar
envelope.

Such is in fact one of the most notable results of the year’s work. In August,
September, and October, 1903, the observations of the ‘‘ solar constant’’ of radiation
indicated that the rate of radiation was about 10 per cent below that observed in
February, 1904. On the other hand measurements of the absorption of the solar
envelope indicated considerably less absorption in February, 1904, than in Septem-
ber, 1903.

The third kind of evidence of change in solar radiation is based on a study of the
temperature of the North Temperate Zone, as indicated by the Internationaler Deka-
denberichte published by the Kaiserliche Marine Deutsche Seewarte, and received
at the Observatory through the kindness of the Librarian of the United States
Weather Bureau. This publication gives the mean temperature at 8 a. m. for each
ten days at each one of about one hundred stations distributed over the principal
land areas of the North Temperate Zone, and for about ninety of these stations there
is also given the normal temperatures for the same ten-day periods, representing the
mean of many years. From these data there have been computed here the temper-
ature departures from the normal since January 1, 1903, and these are compared
graphically in the accompanying chart, Plate VII,“ with the measures of the solar
constant made in 1903. It will be seen that shortly after the observed fall of solar
radiation in March, 1903, a general fall of temperature occurred, which would bea
natural result of such a change. It has been shown here, in accordance with the
known laws of radiation, that 10 per cent fall in the solar radiation could not pro-
duce more than 7°.5 C, fall in terrestrial temperatures, and that several causes, notably

)

sm 1904——6
82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the presence of the oceans, would prevent so great a change of temperature as this
resulting from a temporary diminution of solar radiation of only a few months’ dura-
tion. The observed fall of about 2°.5 C. in the mean temperature of the land areas
of the North Temperature Zone during April, 1903, seems to be therefore in good
accord with the observations of solar radiation.

Owing to the uncommon cloudiness of the first six months of 1904 few measures of
the ‘‘solar constant’? worthy to be compared with the series of 1903 have been
obtained, but taking the best of the measures it appears that high values of solar
radiation in February, 1904, and lower ones in the subsequent months are indicated,
as shown in Table 2, given below. This appears to be in general accord with the
mean temperatures observed over the North Temperate Zone, except that it seems
probable that the solar radiation was high in January as well as February, but the
lack of good observing weather prevented our recognition of it.

Forecasts of temperature.—If subsequent research shall confirm these indications
of a general parallelism between measures of solar radiation and terrestrial temper-
atures, we are now entering upon a new field of climate forecasting. But if such fore-
casts had to depend on measures of the solar radiation outside our atmosphere the
observing station should be remoyed from Washington to a more favorable situation,
for the experience of the last two years has shown that hardly a score of days in a
year are uniformly clear enough to allow even relatively good ‘‘solar constant”’
values to be obtained, and these good days are very unevenly distributed. Fortu-
nately, the distinct work which you have planned on the absorption of the solar
envelope, already mentioned, seems to promise a far easier method of forecasting,
which requires much less of constancy in the atmospheric conditions. Owing to the
preliminary nature of the installation of the great horizontal telescope as thus far
used, and to the fact that the great coelostat has been sent to the exposition at St.
Louis, only the single instance above mentioned of a comparison of the radiation
outside our atmosphere with solar absorption has yet been made; but if future work
shall confirm the general agreement between the indications afforded by the study
of the absorption of the solar envelope and those afforded by the measures of total
solar radiation, the significance of the result will be very great, for the bolometric
investigation of the solar image can be made at any time when the sun shines clear
for five minutes, by a method practically independent of the disturbances of our
own atmosphere, whereas the measures of total radiation require three hours of
unvarying transparency of the air. Accordingly the former measurements may be
made almost daily, and will, it is hoped, prove of great service in temperature
forecasts.

The effects of changes of the transparency of our own atmosphere are, perhaps, of
equal importance in temperature forecasts, and the recognition of these of course
depends on such spectro-bolometric measures as are involved in determinations of
the ‘‘solar constant.’’ Referring to my last year’s report, it will be remembered
that the earlier months of 1903 were found distinguished by more than the average
absorption of light in our atmosphere. In September, 1903, there was a marked
increase in transparency, so that in the latter months of the year the clearness was
almost as great as that of 1901-2. Of course as these studies are made only at Wash-
ington no general conclusions as to the transparency of the air at other stations can
safely be drawn. But if the clearing above mentioned was general it might perhaps
explain the upward tendency during the last months of 1903 of the curve of average
temperatures shown in Plate VII.

I venture to think the importance of studies of atmospheric absorption at other
stations would warrant observers elsewhere in taking up the spectro-bolometric work
involved in measures of the ‘‘solar constant.’’ Measures of the absorption of the
solar envelope, on the other hand, which require the provision of a great solar image,
would not necessarily be duplicated elsewhere.

RESULTS IN DETAIL.

Referring to my report of last year and to your recent publication @ on ‘‘A possible
variation of solar radiation’’ for further information, the following three tables sum-
marize the detailed results of the work already broadly discussed. Tables 1 and 2
are given in continuation of similar tables in last year’s report, and perhaps it needs
only to remark concerning them that the first six months of 1904 have proved uncom-
monly unfavorable to such studies as are here set forth, by reason of unusual cloudi-
ness. Owing to the bad atmospheric conditions there have been no days when
results as satisfactory as many of those of 1903 have been secured, and only two days’
work of 1904, February 11 and May 28, are regarded here as worthy of much confi-
dence. Taking the whole series together and comparing with the results of 1902-3,
it appears probable, however, that excepting during the month of February, the solar
radiation thus far in 1904 has been below the normal, although not so low as during
the latter half of 1903. The atmospheric transmission of 1903-4 seems to be generally
below that of 1902.

Mean value of direct atmospheric transmission.—Since Table 2 was prepared, which
was done without any reference to the subject of the present paragraph, at your
request the numbers in the fifth column have been corrected to represent the solar
radiation at the earth’s surface for zenith sun, and those in the sixth column to
actual rather than mean solar distance. The ratio of the amount of heat which
reaches the earth’s surface for zenith sun to that outside the atmosphere is then
obtained by dividing the former values by the latter, and the mean result is 68 per
cent; whence the average absorption in our atmosphere is found to be 32 per cent,
which is the amount by which the sun’s radiation is diminished in a vertical trans-
mission to the surface of the earth. In this connection attention may be invited to
a paper published by you in the American Journal of Science, as long since as Sep-
tember, 1884, in which you have stated that observations made up to that time by
the best authorities gave a value of absorption for the zenith sun of about 20 per cent,
and that owing chiefly to the neglect of selective absorption, this nearly unanimous
value is nevertheless far inferior to the truth. The value just deduced from selective
absorption methods may be consided as a confirmation of your then statement.

You have elsewhere stated that the solar constant values obtained from high and
low sun measures at a low altitude station are likely to be below rather than above
the truth, and it may at least be admitted that there is a certain direct reflection of
radiation in passing from outer space into our atmosphere, differing as it does from
space in its optical density, and that a portion of radiation is here lost which car not
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. &5

be measured at any single station high or low. Accordingly we must suppose that
our solar constant values are diminished from one or both the above causes, and
hence that the atmospheric abserption here estimated is too little rather than too
much. “8

Turning now to Table 3, which purports to give the vertical transmission for dif-
ferent wave lengths in the solar envelope, this depends but little on our own atmos-
phere, and much is hoped from a continuation of the work with the great horizontal
telescope on which these results rest. As this work is but newly developed here, a
short description of the procedure and assumptions involved in estimating the trans-
mission of the solar envelope will not be out of place. A spectro-bolometer, provided
with a slit only about 5 millimeters high, is set so that rays of a certain known wave
length reach the bolometer from the slit. Then with the prism stationary, but with
the automatic recording plate moving before the galvanometer as usual, the solar
image is allowed to drift by the earth’s diurnal motion across the sht of the spectro-
bolometer. Thus is produced a curve like those shown in Plate VIII, in which hori-
zontal distances from the center of the figure are proportional to distances along the
radius of the solar disc, and the height of the curve is proportional to the intensity of
the radiation of the given wave length at the corresponding point on the solar dise.
Apparently the figure would be ‘ flat-topped,’’ if there was no absorption of the rays
by the solar envelope, and the curvature of the figure gives a rough indication of the
amount of the absorption.¢ If the curve for a given day’s observation has steeper
sides than that of another, greater absorption would be indicated for the former day,
and such was the case for the two days’ work represented in Table 3.

But in order to estimate quantitatively the change in absorption in the solar
envelope, it is necessary to make two assumptions whose truth can as yet only be
verified by the accuracy with which they represent the experimental results. First,
it may be supposed that the radiation of the absorbing envelope is negligible com-
pared with that of the photosphere, and that the absorption is, like that of the
earth’s atmosphere, represented by such an exponential formula as would apply to a
homogeneous atmosphere. Second, the thickness of the absorbing layer being
unknown, its relative thickness compared with the solar radius must be assumed in
order to compute the exponent of the formula.

In the first computations made here it was assumed that the thickness of the
absorbing envelope was very small as compared with the sun’s radius. Upon this

“ You have suggested the possibility that owing to a columnar structure of the solar
surface we might find the limb of the sun brighter than the center of the disc in the
absence of an absorbing envelope, by reason of our seeing near the limb only the
supposedly brighter tops of the columns. No allowance for this is made in these
preliminary computations.

‘
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

basis logarithmic plots¢ prepared from the observed results showed great departures
from straight lines for all wave lengths, so that either the absorbing layer is not so
thin as first assumed, or the phenomenon is not a simple one of absorption. Acting
on the former supposition, it was found that when the absorption was assumed to
take place in a homogeneous stratum of about 45,000 miles thickness outside the
photosphere, or in other words, a rather thick stratum, yet well within the thick-
ness of the brighter part of the solar corona, very little curvature was exhibited in
the logarithmic plots at any wave lengths, or for any distance less than 99 per cent of
a radius from the center of the disc, or on either day of observation. Evidently the
assumption of homogeneity is a very strained one, hardly perhaps to be tolerated
even in a preliminary computation. I have, however, given the transmission coefli-
cients found in this way in Table 3. Estimates have been prepared of the amount
by which the total radiation of the sun would be increased were this envelope
wholly removed, but these are so far dependent upon the assumption referred to that
I defer their presentation for the present.

I wish, in closing, to particularly commend the zeal and ability with which Mr. F.
E. Fowle, jr., has aided in carrying through all the work above reported. Mr. Fowle
has also published ® during the year a valuable study of the absorption of water
vapor in the earth’s atmosphere, which summarizes measurements and computations
he has made from bolographie data collected here in the last three years. He finds
the transmission in each of the water-vapor bands studied to follow Bouguer’s expo-
nential law, but with coefficients of transmission varying greatly in amount for dif-
ferent bands and for different wave lengths in the same band. In passing from band
to band the absorption is generally greater the greater the wave length of the band,
but taking each band by itself the shorter wave lengths are most absorbed.

CONCLUSION.

The work of the year has been distinguished by useful improvements in the appa-
ratus of the Observatory, notably in the bolometer, the pyrheliometer, and the great
horizontal telescope. But chiefly it is marked by a great advance toward what you
have set as the far-off final goal of our efforts, namely, the establishment of a sound
basis for long range forecasting of climate, in the study of the solar radiation, and its
absorption in our atmosphere. The work of the year has made it seem possible,
though not yet certain, that fluctuations of the amount of solar radiation as great as
10 per cent may occur, and that independently of them there are marked changes of
the transparency of our atmosphere. Both causes must profoundly influence cli-
matic conditions, and both are being studied here with increasing facility, accuracy,
and success, by the aid of the spectro-bolometer. In short, it now seems not improb-
able that successful general forecasting of climate will be the not too far distant
outcome of our work.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN.

Str: I have the honor to present the following report on the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904.

The number of publications received and recorded in the accession books of the
Smithsonian deposit, Library of Congress, is as follows:

Quarto or | Octavo or |

| larger. smaller, | Total.

(GROEN GSS Re foes oa le ey ena eae See Se ee eo) | er | ee | 215
i Hose ie oe ea ae Sn ee e  e eee een |eeenereeet os ons
|

The accession numbers run from 452466-460376.

A few of these publications have been temporarily held at the Institution for the use
of the staff, but the larger number have been sent direct to the Library of Congress.

About 355 boxes and 18 packages were used in transmitting the sendings to the
Library of Congress, and they are estimated to have amounted to the equivalent of
14,920 octavo volumes. This does not include a large number of public documents
presented to the Institution and transmitted without being recorded.

The selecting and sending to the Library of Congress of volumes and parts of vol-
umes belonging to the Smithsonian deposit which had been held at the Institution
and Museum in the past has been carried on in connection with the other work of
the library, and while a large number have been sent up there still remain from
last year many volumes ready for checking on the accession books. No separate
count has been kept of these sendings, and they are included in the above estimate.

The libraries of the Secretary, Office, and Astrophysical Observatory have received
during the year 337 volumes, pamphlets and charts, and 2,048 parts of volumes,
making a total of 2,385, and a grand total, including books for the Smithsonian
deposit, of 26,353.

The parts of serial publications that were entered on the card catalogue numbered
24,126. Six thousand slips for completed volumes were made, and about 510 cards
for new periodicals and annuals were added to the permanent record from the
periodical-recording desk.

Inaugural dissertations and academic publications were received from universities
at the following places:

Baltimore (Johns Hop- Halle. Paris.

kins). Heidelberg. Philadelphia (University
Basel. Helsingfors. of Pennsylvania).
Berlin. Ithaca (Cornell), Rostock.
Bern. Jena. St. Petersburg.
Bonn. Kiel. Toulouse.
Breslau. Konigsberg. Tubingen.
Erlangen. Lafayette (Purdue). Utrecht.
Freiburg. Leipsic. Wurzburg.
Giessen. Louvain. Zurich.
Geneva. Marburg.
Greifswald. , New York (Columbia).
88 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The plan inaugurated by the Secretary to effect new exchanges and to secure miss-
ing parts to complete sets, has been continued. In doing this 945 letters were written
and 285 new periodicals were added to the receipts, together with the completion
of 349 defective series. The sending out of postal cards for missing numbers has
been continued, and 105 were mailed, with the result that 53 missing parts were
received in response.

In the reference room the members of the scientific staff and others have consulted
the transactions and proceedings of the learned societies; and in the reading room 20
bound volumes of periodicals and 2,900 separate periodicals were taken out for con-
sultation. The sections maintained in the Institution are the Secretary’s library,
Office library, and the Employee’s library, together with the sectional libraries of
the Astrophysical Observatory, Aerodromics, International Exchanges, and Law
Reference.

At the close of last year 64 volumes in the Astrophysical Observatory library had
just been completed and made ready for binding, and in the early part of this year
they were bound.

The collection of. books in the library at the National Zoolgical Park has had an
addition, by purchase, of 15 works on the life and habits of animals and birds, and
one or two exchanges of periodical publications have been effected by the Institution
for its special benefit.

The employees have availed themselves of the privileges of the Employee’s
library, and 3,220 books were borrowed, that number being a considerable increase
over last year. The library has had an addition, by purchase, of 87 new books, and
120 magazines were bound. The sending of a collection of books, numbering about
40, each month to the National Zoological Park has been continued with such success
that an arrangement was made in the early part of June to make a similar sending
to the Bureau of American Ethnology, and a case containing about 26 volumes was
sent.

The increase in the number of books presented by General de Peyster, for the
Watts de Peyster collection Napoléon Buonaparte, created the necessity for more
shelf room, and 22 cases were constructed to hold the additions to this collection
that have been received during the last two years. These cases were placed against
the north and south walls of the lower corridor of the office wing of the Institution.
General de Peyster continues to add many valuable volumes to the collection,
together with several bronze busts. There have also been received from him oil
paintings and many historical relics of the colonial period, which have been placed
in the United States National Museum for exhibition.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

The work of the International Catalogue has been continued under the auspices of
the Institution, and the addition to the allotment for this year has made possible the
increase of nearly 50 per cent in the total number of references sent to the central
bureau at London. The following table gives the number in detail:

Totals sts. ois 25h c Nee See ts ee Se ese ae PAPAS}

All of the first annual issue of the catalogue has now been published and distrib-
uted, together with the following volumes of the second annual issue: Astronomy,
sacteriology, Mechanics, Physics, Mathematics, Mineralogy, and Physical Geogra-
phy. This country still leads in the number of subscribers to the catalogue.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 89

In the near future an effort will be made looking to a more complete cooperation
of the authors and publishing bodies in the United States with this Regional Bureau
by requesting immediate notice-and subject abstract of new publications coming
within the scope of the International Catalogue.

The international convention, which has the power of revision of the classification
schedules, will meet in London in July, 1905, and has asked tor suggestions from
this country through the Smithsonian Institution.

MUSEUM LIBRARY.

The National Museum library has received a gift from Prof. Otis Tuflton Mason,
in addition to the one of some years ago, of about 2,000 pamphlets, separates, and
bound quarto volumes, mostly on anthropological subjects. A special book plate
has been provided for this collection. The Museum has also received from Dr.
Edward L. Greene his entire botanical library, which has been placed on deposit
for a period of ten years in connection with his botanical collection. The conditions
regarding Doctor Greene’s library are that the books shall be accessible on the same
terms as other books in the Museum library, with the exception that they are not
to be lent to persons outside the District of Columbia or abroad without Doctor
Greene’s consent. In case of the death of Doctor Greene during the time specified,
the library becomes the property of the United States.

In the Museum library there are now 20,548 bound volumes and 35,950 unbound
papers. The additions during the year consisted of 1,504 books, 3,187 pamphlets,
and 700 parts of volumes. There were catalogued 938 books, of which 40 belonged
to the Smithsonian deposit, and 2,130 pamphlets, of which 70 belonged to the Smith-
sonian deposit, and 11,520 parts of periodicals, of which 1,887 belonged to the Smith-
sonian deposit. In the accession book 1,387 volumes, 2,187 pamphlets, and 629 parts
of volumes were recorded. The number of cards added to the authors’ catalogue
were 4,090, which does not include 2,855 cards for books and pamphlets recatalogued,

In connection with the entering of periodicals 171 memoranda were made report-
ing volumes and parts missing in the sets, together with a few titles of publications
which were not represented in the library. The result of this work was the com-
pleting, or partly filling up, of 70 sets of periodicals.

The number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed from the general
library amounted to 26,456, including 5,679, which were assigned to the sectional
libraries.

There has been no change in the sectional libraries established in the Museum,
and they are as follows:

Administration. Fishes. Paleobotany.
Administrative assis- Geology. Parisites.

tant. History. Photography.
Anthropology. Insects. Prehistoric archeology.
Biology. Mammals. Reptiles.
Birds. Marine invertebrates. Stratigraphic paleontology.
Botany. Materia medica. Superintendent.
Children’s room. Mesozoic fossils. Taxidermy.

APPENDIX VIII.

REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTI-
TUTION AND NATIONAL MUSEUM, LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPO-
SITION, ST. LOUIS, MO., 1904.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition held at St. Louis, Mo., from April 80 to December 1, 1904,
inclusive :

An act of Congress approved June 28, 1902, provided for a Government
exhibit to be made by the several Executive Departments, bureaus, and other
organizations, including the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum,
under the management of a Government. board. The sum of $800,000 was
appropriated for this exhibit, and for buildings the sum of $450,000.

The main Government building, containing a floor space of 102,000 square
feet, was located on an eminence at the east end of the Exposition grounds.
Adjoining it was a smaller building for the aquarium and other exhibits of
the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, and at a short distance
farther south was erected a large cage for the exhibits of the National Zoolog-
ical Park. A building and inclosure for the exhibit of the Life-Saving Service
were located in another part of the grounds.

Congress subsequently appropriated the sum of $100,000 for an exhibit of
the agricultural and experiment stations and colleges of mechanic arts. This
exhibit was placed in the education building.

The principal embellishment of the interior of the Government building was
a reproduction of the Statue of Liberty, by Crawford, which surmounts the
dome of the Capitol. The replica was made in staff by Mr. U. S. J. Dunbar
from the original model in the rotunda of the National Museum.

The space in the Government building assigned to the Smithsonian Institution
and National Museum comprised about 16,500 square feet, having a frontage on
the main aisle of a little over 200 feet and a depth of about 77 feet. It was
located on the south side of the building, beginning at the rotunda and adjoin-
ing the space of the Post-Office Department at the farther end.

One end of this space was occupied by a specially designed pavilion 77 feet
long and 25 feet wide, containing the exhibits of the Smithsonian Institution
proper (including the Hodgkins fund), the Bureau of International Exchanges,
and the Astrophysical Observatory, as well as a representation of the Children’s
Room in the Smithsonian building at Washington. The remainder of the space
was occupied by the exhibit of the National Museum and that of the Bureau of
American Ethnology.

In addition to the space in the Government building, an area outside, about
100 by 800 feet and lying 100 or 200 yards south of the building, as already
stated, was assigned to the exhibit of the National Zoological Park, consisting
of a large flying cage for birds.

A large coelostat, which constituted a part of the exhibit of the Astrophysical
Observatory, was also placed outside the Government building, about 30 feet
south, opposite the east end of the Smithsonian space, a brick pier being erected
as a foundation.

The allotment of funds to the Institution and Museum from the appropriation
for a Government exhibit was $110,000,

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION PROPER.

IO

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution occupied a space of about 625
square feet in the central court of the pavilion mentioned above. A special
table case -was placed in the middle of this court in which were displayed
copies of the History of the First Half Century of the Smithsonian Institution,
the seal of the Institution, and several Hodgkins medals. A continuous seat
extended along the east wall of the court, above which were displayed two
portraits of James Smithson, copies of his scientific papers, a cast of the
bronze tablet which was placed on his tomb at Genoa, Italy, and pictures of the
tomb itself. Adjoining these objects was a series of photographs of the chan-
cellors and regents of the Institution and portraits of the secretaries. On the
south wall of the court was exhibited a portrait of Thomas G. Hodgkins and
circulars and papers relating to the Hodgkins fund. <A portion of the north
wall of the court was occupied by an exhibit from the Bureau of International
Inxchanges, consisting of a large statistical chart, showing its operations for
a period of fifty-three years. A complete series of the publications of
the Institution and all its dependencies. comprising 278 volumes, was also
exhibited in this space. Hung in midair over the pavilion was the quarter-size
model of the Langley gas-driven aerodrome of 1904. The Langley steam-driven
aerodrome of 1896 was also hung in midair about 30 feet in front of the former.
Three enlarged photographs of the steam-driven aerodrome when in motion
were hung on the side-walls of the pavilion.

The Children’s Room occupied the portion of the pavilion abutting on the
main aisle. In shape, size, and character of fittings and exhibits, the room
was, aS nearly as possible, a replica of the original room in the Smithsonian
building. Around the walls were specially constructed low cases of light-
colored wood, while in the center of the room, on a low stand, was an aquarium,
and near by a cage of living song-birds. A portion of the wall-case was oc-
cupied by birds of interest to children, among which were the following:
Familiar birds of the United States; birds-of-paradise, and others noted for
their brilliancy of coloring: interesting water-birds, such as the eider duck,
lapwing, avocet, European stork, penguin, barnacle goose; other noteworthy
birds, such as the apteryx, rook, jackdaw, and lyre bird, the harpy eagle, the
condor, and examples of the largest and smallest owls. In this room were
also exhibited the duckbill, or platypus, and the spiny ant-eater, peculiar
egg-laying mammals from Australia. ‘To illustrate how animals are protected
by their color and form, or ‘‘ how creatures hide,” was shown a weasel in
the white winter coat on snow-covered ground, and another in the brown
summer coat amid dead leaves; also an underwing moth on bark, and such
peculiar insects as the katydid and walking-stick. Curious forms of life were
shown in the finger sponge, the glass sponge. the organ-pipe coral, and the
sea-horse, as well as brilliantly colored parrot fishes. The room also contained
a small exhibit of useful minerals. In the south and east part of the wall-
case was a collection of beautiful and interesting shells, including those of the
giant clam, Jridacna. In another part of the room were some comparative
exhibits, such as a cast of the egg of the extinct bird Hpyornis and the egg
of a hummingbird, representing the largest and smallest eggs. Groups of
brilliant North American and South American butterflies, and of familiar
forms, arranged to show life-histories, were also exhibited.

As a part of the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution, may be mentioned
a descriptive pamphlet of 35 pages and 12 plates, for gratuitous distribution
to the public, being an account of the Smithsonian Institution, its origin, his
tory, objects, and: achievements.
102 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

As already mentioned, this exhibit occupied the south court of the main
pavilion, which could be entered only from the court devoted to the Smith-
sonian proper. At previous expositions, the exhibit of this Bureau consisted
of publications, charts of the infra-red spectrum, and other charts relating to
astrophysics, some small pieces of apparatus, and a series of transparent
photographs of solar eclipses and of sun spots. All these objects were exhibited
at St. Louis, and in addition a working exhibit was prepared. This consisted,
first, of a bolometer connected with a galvanometer, on which was attached
a mirror which threw a spot of light on a horizontal scale, so that any change
of temperature in the bolometer would be transmitted to the galvanometer
and the spot could be seen to move. This change of temperature could be
brought about by a visitor simply holding his hand over a hole in the case
in which the bolometer was placed. The whole exhibit was carefully labeled,
and there was scarcely a moment during the day when visitors could not be
found watching the workings of this delicate instrument for measuring slight
changes in temperature.

The other moving exhibit consisted of a large two-mirrored coelostat, specially
constructed for this exposition, which, as before mentioned, was located about
30 feet south of the Government building, opposite the court in which the astro-
physical exhibit was made. This coelostat on sunny days reflected a large beam
of sunlight through a window into a dark room which occupied over half of the
astrophysical court. Part of the beam of sunlight was thrown through a tele-
scope, which in turn threw a large image of the sun on the north wall of the dark
room. At scarcely any time during the seven months of the exposition was
the visitor unable to find large sun-spots, or groups of spots, on this image.
Another portion of the beam of light was reflected by a series of mirrors to a
grating of speculum metal, which in turn threw a brilliant solar spectrum
around the east and south walls of the dark room. To make this exhibit more
intelligible to the public, a descriptive illustrated pamphlet, written by the
director, was distributed gratuitously to those desiring copies.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK,

At previous expositions the exhibit of the National Zoological Park has con-
sisted of pictures of the buildings and paddocks in the park, with the addition,
usually, of a small model of the park itself. It was felt that such a representa-
tion of this Bureau at the St. Louis Exposition would be inadequate, and, after
ns eareful consideration of possibilities, an extensive exhibit of birds, placed in
a eage large enough to permit them to fly about, was decided upon. The cage
was 228 feet long, 84 feet wide, and 50 feet high, and was erected by the Super-
vVising Architect of the Treasury Department at the request of the representa-
tive of the Institution from the appropriation for Government buildings, at a
cost of about $17,500. This cage, which was designed by the superintendent of
the park, was probably the largest of its kind ever built. It was traversed by
central arched passageway, open to the public, extending the entire length of
the cage. As alrendy mentioned, the cage was situated 100 or 200 yards south
of the main building, in a small valley, amid trees, several of which were in-
closed by the cage. It was divided into two portions by a longitudinal parti-
tion. In the north half were confined the larger birds, among which were
gulls, three species of wild geese, trumpeter swans, Cuban flamingos, roseate
spoonbills, four species of ibis, three species of heron, demoiselle cranes, white
pelicans, brown pelicans, European pelicans, and other birds, such as darters,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1038

cormorants, Curassows, and vultures. In the south half of the cage were
placed the smaller birds, such as quails, partridges, doves, ducks, canaries,
Innglish blackbirds, jays, thrushes, Javan sparrows, bullfinches, goldfinches,
weaver birds, linnets, cardinals: orioles, etc. The exhibit of the National
Zoological Park proved one of the most attractive in the exposition grounds,
and was surrounded by visitors at all times during the day. The exhibit re-
quired the constant attention of two men. The records show that the large
fish-eating birds consumed an average daily amount of 40 pounds of fish and 5
pounds of chopped meat, while for the smaller birds large quantities of fresh
vegetables, grains, and other seeds were required.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES,

It will be appreciated that the work of the Bureau of International Exchanges
does not lend itself to exhibition by material objects. The exhibit at St. Louis
consisted of a large chart showing the number of packages transmitted each
year from the establishment of the bureau to the present time. There were also
shown photographs of the offices of the bureau in the Smithsonian building. In
order to explain more fully the functions and operations of the bureau a small
descriptive pamphlet was prepared, copies of which were given to those desiring
them.

THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The exhibit of the Bureau of American Ethnology was for the most part
incorporated with that of the department of anthropology of the United States
National Museum, both of which were under the direction of Mr. W. H. Holmes,
chief of the bureau. This exhibit was chiefly illustrative of the symbolic «art,
decorative designs, and heraldry of the American Indians, and represented the
researches of the ethnologists of the bureau. Included with it was a series of
objects representing the archieology of the West Indies. These exhibits were
installed in recesses in the frout wall of the Smithsonian pavilion, in a portion
of the south wall case. and in two large floor cases. Further notice of this
exhibit and of the special significance of the various objects shown will be found
on pages 47 to 49 of this report. A considerable amount of field-work was done
in this connection by Messrs. Fewkes, Swanton, and Mooney, and Mrs. Steven-
son, ethnologists of the bureau, notice of which will be found in the place
mentioned.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

As at all previous expositions, the largest display was made by the National
Museum, owing to its special function and its opportunities for making large
exhibits. ‘The floor-space not occupied by the bureaus already mentioned was
roughly divided into three portions, one devoted to each of the three executive
departments of the Museum—namely, anthropology, biology, and geology.

The Department of Anthropology.—This exhibit was planned by Mr. W. TH.
Holmes, chief of the Bureau of Ethnology, assisted by the curators of the
department of anthropology. The main theme of this exhibit was the esthetie
achievements of the native American peoples. In conjunction therewith, some
of the works of art of ancient civilizations of the Old World were shown.

The carvings of the American Indians were represented by such objects as
stone and wooden masks, carved boxes, benches, horns, weapons, ete. These
were installed in a special black floor-ecase. The larger carvings included four
house-panels of the Tlinkit Indians and two large house-posts of the Haida
Indians, The former were placed on the wall and the latter on the floor. To

.
104 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

these were added two large totem poles, which, owing to lack of space, as well
as on account of their large size, were set up out-of-doors, in front of the Indian
school building, at the opposite end of the exposition grounds.

The exhibit of textile arts represented the work of tribes of the Northwest,
those of the Pueblo region, and the Indians of Central and South America.
Among the latter were examples of the beautiful woven garments found in the
ancient cemetery at Ancon, Peru. In a portion of one of the cases containing
the textile arts were specimens of the closely-related feather work of the Ameri-
can Indians, comprising headdresses, wristbands, and other ornaments. This
exhibit was installed in two special floor-cases.

The ceramic art was represented by various pieces of pottery of the Indians
of North, Central, and South America, which were displayed in a special floor
‘ase, while around the top of the Smithsonian pavilion and the top of that part
of the wall cases devoted to the Bureau of American Ethnology were placed as
decorative objects 29 specimens of Indian pottery.

Another special case was devoted to the basketry of various Jndian tribes
and contained about 50 baskets of different forms and patterns.

A special floor-case contained objects representing the sculpture of the Ameri-
can Indians, such as idols, yokes, carved animals, tablets, weapons, Celts,
metates, pipes, ete. Other objects of sculpture, placed on separate pedestals.
were a cast of a colossal figure of an Aztee deity from the ancient City of
Mexico, a cast of a statue of a Mayan deity from the ruined city of Quirigua,
Guatemala, and a east of an ancient statue from Costa Rica. A scuiptured
altar-panel from an ancient Mayan temple and ceremonial subjects in relief
from a temple at Menche, Mexico, were placed on large screens.

The architecture of the American Indians was represented by complete resto-
rations, on a reduced seale, of five of the ruined temples of the Aztecs of Mexico,
namely, the 'Temple of Xochicalco at Morales, the “Temple of the Cross” at
Palenque, the ‘House of the Governor” at Uxmal, the “Temple of the Col-
umns ” at Mitla, and the “ Castle”? at Chichen-Itza, each placed on a large sepa-
rate pedestal. ‘These temples were arranged in a group in the center of the
space of the department of anthropology. They were built under the imme-
diate direction of Mr. W. H. Holmes by Delancey Gill, architect, and Messrs.
H. W. Hendley and W. H. Gill, sculptors. On two large screens near these tem-
ples were hung photographs and drawings of the ruined cities in which the
originals of these buildings were found.

In the section assigned to anthropology was exhibited an historical collection
made by the Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, whose
archives and collections are, by provision of law, deposited in the Smithsonian
Institution. A picture of the Continental Hall now being erected in Washington,
and portraits of the presidents-general of the society were also shown, together
with a small series of objects of historical interest belonging to the Society of
the Children of the American Revolution. <A portrait of Baron von Closen was
also exhibited.

Department of Biology.—The exhibit of this Department was planned by Dr.
F. W. True, bead curator, assisted by Mr. F. A. Lucas and others of the
Museum staff. While illustrating the methods of preparing, arranging, install-
ing, and labeling zoological collections employed in the National Museum, it was
designed also with a view of displaying some of the largest, most striking, and
most beautiful forms of animal life now existing. On account of the character
of the exposition, the exhibit was given a world-wide scope. Many objects were
taken from the permanent exhibition-series, and others obtained and prepared
especially for this exhibit, Botanical exhibits were omitted for the reason that

ENTRANCE TO ST. Louis EXHIBIT OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY, SHOWING
TRANSPARENCIES OF THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AS OBSERVED AT WADES-

Boro, N. C., 1900.
REPORT OF THE SECTETARY. 105

the botanical division of the department consists at present practically only of
an herbarium, the collections of which it was thought could not be made inter-
esting to the general publie.

The most striking feature of the exhibit at St. Louis was the cast of 2 sulphur-
bottom whale, the largest known animal. This large piece was suspended over
the central aisle of the Museum space. Placed on the floor near it, was a
skeleton of the same species. The cast was obtained through the courtesy of
the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, and the skeleton by gift from the Colonial
Manufacturing Company, at Balena, Hermitage Bay, Newfoundland, by Messrs.
F. A. Lueas, William Palmer, and J. W. Scollick, who made a special expedition
to Newfoundland in the spring of 1904 to secure the material.

Another prominent feature of the exhibit of this department comprised a
group of 20 game mammals from all parts of the world, namely: From North
America, a black bear, a polar bear, an Alaska moose, a Mexican sheep, a Green-
land musk-ox, a specimen of Osborn’s caribou, and an Olympie elk; from Africa,
a giraffe, a zebra, a two-horned rhinoceros, a white-tailed gnu, a hippopotamus,
and a lion; from Asia, a tiger, a sambar stag, a specimen of Marco Polo’s
sheep, an axis deer; from Europe, a chamois, a moufflon or wild sheep, and a
Norway elk. Hach was placed on a separate pedestal and the whole group
inclosed by brass railing.

A small but very popular part of the exhibit of the department was a select
collection of birds’ eggs, installed in two special table-cases. In one was a
series showing variations in size, form, color, and texture, and in the number
laid at one time. Among these eggs was one of Hpyornis maximus, an extinct
bird of Madagascar, whose eggs are the largest known. By a fortunate coin-
cidence, an opportunity occurred to purchase a remarkably fine example for
addition to this series. Other interesting eggs in this case were those of the
apteryx, the great auk, three species of ostrich, several species of tinamou, and
the ruby-throated hummingbird. In the second case was placed a very complete
collection of the eggs of North American birds of prey.

The main exhibit of birds was installed in four 30-inch screen-cases, and con-
sisted of a series of pheasants especially noteworthy for the brillianey of their
plumage, such as Lady Amherst’s pheasant, fire-back pheasants, tragopans, ete.
Three species of peafowl were included in this series, each represented by a male
and a female. Among the other birds exhibited was a pair of the rare and
curious Harris’s cormorant, from the Galapagos Islands, a species incapable of
flight owing to its dwarfed wings and to the soft, flexible nature of the primary
feathers. Installed in a special floor case was a group of hoaczins, Opistho-
comus hoaczin, showing the life-history of the species. This material of group
consisted of 4 adults, 3 nestlings, 2 half-grown young, 2 nests, 2 eggs, together
with bushes and other accessories, and was specially collected for exhibition at
St. Louis. The young of this singular bird possess well-developed claws on the
first and second digits of the wing, by means of which they climb from branch
to branch with comparative ease.

Reptiles were represented by mounted specimens of the American crocodile
and alligator, which were placed near one another, so that the differences
between these two largest of American reptiles could be readily seen. In addi-
tion, two special cases of snakes were exhibited; one contained a reticulated
python, probably the largest species of snake in existence, and the other a small
series of especially noteworthy poisonous and harmless snakes, such as the
cobra, the rattlesnake, the harlequin snake, and the king snake.

A unique exhibit of unusual significance and interest consisted of a series of
models of deep-sea fishes, installed in two short sections of the wall-case.

‘
106 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

These models were based chiefly on speciinens in the National Museum, from
the rich collections of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross. Owing to
the small size of the originals, it was necessary to enlarge the models so that
the extraordinary modifications and fantastic appearance of these inhabitants
of the deep-sea could be appreciated by the public. Accompanying this series
was a diagram showing the great depths at which these peculiar forms are
found, in comparison with the other fishes of the sea. The following species
were represented: Deep-sea chimera (Harriotta raleighana), hatchet fish
(Sternoptyx diaphana), rag fish (Acrotus willoughbyi), pelican fish (Gastros-
tomus bairdii), snipe eel (Nemichthys scolopaceus), lesser angler (Cryptopsaras
couesii), viper fish (Chauliodus sioani), Bathypterois quadrifilis, great swal-
lower (Chiasmadon niger), deep sea gurnard (Peristedion miniatwm), and the
species Caulolepis longidens. Malacosteus choristodactylus, and Malacosteus
niger.

Invertebrates were represented by two series of specimens, installed in stand-
ard Museum unit boxes, arranged in frames along the wall. The first was a syn;
optic series of invertebrates displaying the principal groups, the more important
forms in each group, their structure, and, so far as possible, important or inter-
esting features in their life histories. This series was designed especially to show
methods of Museum installation. In two sections of the wall case near this
series was a special display of fan corals, and another of crabs. The second
principal series of invertebrates consisted of about 500 species of butterflies and
moths from all parts of the world, selected with special reference to beauty or
singularity of color and markings or large size. Hach species was represented
by a pair of specimens, making about 1,000 in all. The specimens were remark-
able for their perfection, and the whole series was, as night be imagined, hardly
to be surpassed in briilianey.

Department of Geology.—tThe exhibit of this department was planned by Dr.
George P. Merrill, head curator, assisted by members of his staff, and embraced
four main groups: First, an exhibit of minerals: second, one of meteorites ;
third, of invertebrate fossils, and, fourth, of vertebrate fossils.

(1) A systematic series of minerals was installed in eight standard 15-inch
Museum cases. ‘This series was remarkably complete, and the various species
were represented by specimens of the largest size. A complete and particularly
fine series of all the known forms of silica occurring in nature was shown in a
special 36-inch screen case. This included examples of agates, jasper, wood-
opal, ete. In a companion case was exhibited a similar series comprising all
the known natural forms of calcium carbonate, such as Iceland spar and other
calcites, stalagmites, limestone, pearis, etc. In proximity to the silica exhibit
was displayed one of the largest masses of amethyst crystals known, and a
giant quartz crystal. The amethyst crystals weighed about a quarter of a ton.
Another mineral exhibit consisted of a series of cones from hot springs, showing
the deposit of crystals on, the interior.

(2) Meteorites: Special pains were taken to assemble an exhibit of meteor-
ites worthy of the occasion. To this end endeavors were made to obtain
representations of the largest known examples. Through the courtesy of Com-
mander R. E. Perry, U. S. N., casts were secured of the three great masses from
Greenland, known as the ‘“ Peary meteorites,” and with the concurrence of the
Mexican Government and the friendly assistance of José G. Aguilera a cast of
the Bacubirito meteorite was also secured. <A special trip to Mexico for the pur-
pose of obtaining a mold was undertaken by Dr. George P. Merrill and Mr. Wil-
liam Palmer, with entirely satisfactory results. A cast was also made of the

Irwin-Ainsa or Tucson meteorite, in the National Museum. These great casts,
which include representations of the largest masses which are known to have
fallen from the sky, were assembled near the rotunda of the building, and pre-
sented a most impressive appearance. Adjacent to the casts was installed a
series of actual specimens of meteorites and sections of specimens, and a chart
showing the distribution of known meteoric falls, and pictures of falling
ineteorites.

(3) Vertebrate fossils: The most popular feature of this exhibit was the life-
size restoration of an armored dinosaur, known as Stegasaurus ungulatus,
based on remains from Colorado and Wyoming. ‘The skeleton of the horned
dinosaur, V'riceratops, previously exhibited at Buffalo and Charleston, was also
shown at St. Louis. Standing side by side, in order to show their similarity in
size and details of structure, were exhibited the skeleton of an American mas-
todon and that of an African elephant. The skeleton and the cast of an egg
of one of the moas (extinct birds from New Zealand) were exhibited in a special
case. Other vertebrate fossils were represented by specimens on the slabs of
stone in which they were found, embracing fossil fishes, fossil fish-like and
crocodile-like reptiles, as well as a very complete specimen of the remarkable
flying reptile, Rhamphorhynchus, which shows the impress of the wing and
tail membranes in the rock.

(4) Invertebrate fossils: ‘These were installed in a section of the wall-case,
and comprised cephalopod and other mollusks, including a fine series of ammon-
ites, and crustaceans, crinoids, echinoderms, and corals.

(5) Fossil palm: An opportunity to obtain an exceptionally fine Tertiary
fossil palm, Latanites vicentinus, having occurred during the preparations for
the exposition, the specimen was purchased and added to the geological exhibit.
It was obtained in Monte Bolka, province of Verona, Italy.

Dr. F. W. True, representative for the Institution and Museum on the Gov-
ernment board, was also chairman of the committee on installation and decora-
tion. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., was chief special agent.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the Genrrat Apprnpix to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its
history, been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as
would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earher method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of pages (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1904.

EXPERIMENTS WITH THE.LANGLEY AERODROME.

By S. P. LANGLEY.

The experiments undertaken by the Smithsonian Institution upon
an aerodrome, or flying machine, capable of carrying a man have
been suspended from lack of funds to repair defects in the launching
apparatus without the machine ever having been in the air at all. As
these experiments have been popularly, and of late repeatedly, rep-
resented as having failed on the contrary, because the aerodrome could
not sustain itself in the air I have decided to give this brief though
late account, which may be accepted as the first authoritative state-
ment of them.

It will be remembered that in 1896 wholly successful flights of
between one-half and one mile by large steam-driven models, unsup-
ported except by the mechanical effects of steam engines, had
been made by me. In all these the machine was first launched into
the air from “ways,” somewhat as a ship is launched into the
water, the machine resting on a car that ran forward on these ways,
which fell down at the extremity of the car’s motion, releasing the
aerodrome for its free flight. I mention these details because they
are essential to an understanding of what follows, and partly because
their success led me to undertake the experiments on a much larger
scale I now describe.

In the early part of 1898 a board, composed of officers of the
Army and Navy, was appointed to investigate these past experi-
ments with a view to determining just what had been accomplished
and what the possibilities were of developing a large-size man-
carrying machine for war purposes. The report of this board being
favorable, the Board of Ordnance and Fortification of the War
Department decided to take up the matter, and I having agreed to
give without compensation what time I could spare from official
duties, the Board allotted $50,000 for the development, construction,
and test of a large aerodrome, half of which sum was to be available
immediately and the renrainder when required. The whole matter
had previously been laid before the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, who had authorized me to take up the work and

114 EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME.

to use in connection with it such facilities of the Institution as were
available.

Before consenting to undertake the construction of this large
machine, I had fully appreciated that owing to theoretical considera-
tions, into which I do not enter, it would need to be relatively
lighter than the smaller one; and later it was so constructed, each
foot of sustaining surface in the large machine carrying nearly the
same weight as each foot in the model. The difficulties subsequently
experienced with the larger machine were, then, due not to this
cause, but to practical obstacles connected with the launching, and the
hike.

I had also fully appreciated the fact that one of the chief difficul-
ties in its construction would lie in the procuring of a suitable engine
of sufficient power and, at the same time, one which was light enough.
(The models had been driven by steam engines whose water supply
weighed too much for very long flights.) The construction of the
steam engine is well understood, but now it would become necessary
to replace this by gas engines, which for this purpose involve novel
difficulties. I resolved not to attempt the task of constructing the
engine myself, and had accordingly entered into negotiations with
the best engine builders in this country, and after long delay had
finally secured a contract with a builder who, of all persons engaged
in such work, seemed most likely to achieve success. It was only
after this contract for the engine had been signed that I felt willing
to formally undertake the work of building the aerodrome.

The contract with the engine builder called for an engine developing
12 brake horsepower, and weighing not more than 100 pounds, includ-
ing cooling water and all other accessories, and with the proviso that
a second engine, exactly like this first one, would be furnished on the
same terms. The first engine was to be delivered before the close
of February, 1899, and the frame of the aerodrome with sustaining
surfaces, propellers, shafting, rudders, etc., was immediately planned,
and now that the engine was believed to be secured, their actual con-
struction was pushed with the utmost speed. The previous experi-
ments with steam-driven models, which had been so successful, had
been conducted over the water, using a small house-boat having a cabin
for storing the machine, appliances and tools, on top of which was
mounted a track and car for use in launching. As full success in
launching these working models had been achieved after several
years spent in devising, testing and improving this plan, I decided
to follow the same method with the large machine, and accordingly
designed and had built a house-boat, in which the machine could not
only be stored, but which would also furnish space for workshops,
and on the top of which was mounted a turntable and track for use
in launching from whatever direction the wind might come.
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME. Duley

Everything connected with the work was expedited as much as
possible with the expectation of being able to have the first trial
flight before the close of 1899, and time and money had been spent
on the aerodrome, which was ready, except for its engine, when the
time for the delivery of this arrived. But now the builder proved
unable to complete his contract, and, after months of delay, it was
necessary to decrease the force at work on the machine proper and
its launching appliances until some assurance could be had of the
final success of the engine. During the spring and summer of 1899.
while these delays were being experienced in procuring suitable
engines, former experiments on superposed wing surfaces were con-
tinued, time was found for overhauling the two steam-driven models
which had been used in 1896, and the small house boat was rebuilt
so that further tests of these small machines might be made in order
to study the effect of various changes in the balancing and _ the
steering, equilibrium preserving and sustaining apphances, and the
months of June, July, and a portion of August were spent in actual
tests of these machines in free flight.

A new launching apparatus following the general plan of the
former overhead one, but with the track underneath it, was built
for the models, and it was used most successfully in these experi-
ments, more than a dozen flights in succession being made with it,
while in every case it worked without delay or accident. As soon
as these tests with the models on this underneath launching apparatus
were completed, that for the large machine was built as an exact
duplicate, except for the enlargement, and with some natural con-
fidence that what had worked so perfectly on a small scale would
work fairly on a large one.

It was recognized from the very beginning that it would be desir-
able in a large machine to use “superposed” sustaining surfaces
(that is, with one wing above another) on account of their supe-
riority so far as the relation of strength to weight is concerned,
and from their independence of guy wiring; and two sets of
superposed sustaining surfaces of different patterns were built and
experimented with in the early tests. These surfaces proved, on the
whole, inferior in hfting power, though among compensating ad-
vantages are the strength of a “bridge” construction which dis-
penses with guy wires coming up from below, which, in fact, later
were the cause of disaster in the launching.

It was finally decided to follow what experiment had shown to be
successful, and to construct the sustaining surfaces for the large
machine after the “single-tier” plan. This proved to be no easy
task, since in the construction of the surfaces for the small machines
the main and cross ribs of the framework had been made solid, and,
after steaming, bent and dried to the proper curvature, while it was
116 EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME.

obvious that this plan could not be followed in the large surfaces on
account of the necessity, already alluded to, of making them rela-
tively lighter than the small ones, which were already very light.
After the most painstaking construction, and. tests of various sizes
and thicknesses of hollow square, hollow round, I-beam, channel, and
many other types of ribs, I finally devised a type which consisted of
a hollow box form, having its sides of tapering thickness, with the
thickest payt at the point midway between contiguous sides and with
small partitions placed inside every few inches in somewhat the same
way that nature places them in the bamboo. These various parts
of the rib (corresponding to the quill in a wing) were then glued and
clamped together, and after drying were reduced to the proper
dimensions and the ribs covered with several coats of a special marine
varnish, which it had been found protected the glued joints from
softening, even when they were immersed in water for twenty-four
hours.

Comparative measurements were made between these large cross
ribs, 11 feet long, and a large quill from the wing of a harpy eagle,
which is probably one of the greatest wonders that nature has pro-
duced in the way of strength for weight. These measurements
showed that the large, 11-foot ribs (“ quills”) for the sustaining sur-
faces of the large machine were equally as strong, weight for weight,
as the quill of the eagle; but much time was consumed in various con-
structions and tests before such a result was finally obtained.

During this time a model of the large machine, one-fourth of its
linear dimensions, was constructed, and a second contract was made
for an engine for it. The delay with the large engine was repeated
with the small one, and in the spring of 1900 it was found that both
contract engines were failures for the purpose for which they were
intended, as neither one developed half of the power required for the
allotted weight.

T accordingly again searched all over this country, and, finally, ac-
companied by an engineer (Mr. Manly), whose services I had engaged,
went to Europe, and there personally visited large builders of engines
for automobiles, and attempted to get them to undertake the conStruc-,
tion of such an engine as was required. This search, however, was
fruitless, as all of the foreign builders, as well as those of this country,
believed it impossible to construct an engine of the necessary power
and as light as I required (less than 10 pounds to the horsepower
without fuel or water). I was therefore forced to return to this
country and to consent most reluctantly, even at this late date, to
have the work of constructing suitable engines undertaken in the
shops of the Smithsonian Institution, since, as I have explained, the
aerodrome frame and wings were already constructed. This work
upon the engines began here in August, 1900, in the immediate care
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME. EG

of Mr. Manly. These engines were to be of nearly double the power
first estimated and of little more weight, but this increased power and
the strain caused by it demanded a renewal of the frame as first built,
in a stronger and consequently in a heavier form, and the following
sixteen months were spent in such a reconstruction simultaneously
with the work on the engines.

The flying weight of the machine complete, with that of the
aeronaut, was 830 pounds; its sustaining surface, 1,040 square feet.
It therefore was provided with slightly greater sustaining surface
and materially greater relative horsepower than the model subse-
quently described which fiew successfully. The brake horsepower
of the engine was 52; the engine itself, without cooling water, or
fuel. weighed approximately 1 kilogram to the horsepower. The en-
tire power plant, including cooling water, carburetor, battery, ete..
weighed materially less than 5 pounds to the horsepower. Engines
for both the large machine and the quarter-size model were completed
before the close of 1901, and they.were immediately put in their
respective frames and tests of them and their power-transmission
apphances were begun.

It is well here to call attention to the fact that although an engine
may develop sufficient power for the allotted weight, yet it is not at
all certain that it will be suitable for use on a machine which is
necessarily as light as one for traversing the air, for it would be
impossible to use, for instance, a single cylinder gasoline engine in a
flying machine unless it had connected to it prohibitively heavy fly-
wheels. These facts being recognized, the engines built in the Smith-
sonian shops were provided with five cylinders, and it was found
upon test that the turning effect received from them was most uniform,
and that, by suitable balancing of rotating and reciprocating parts,
they could be made to work so that there was practically no vibration,
even when used in the very light frames of the aero:lromes.

The engine is not all the apparatus connected with the development
and delivery of power, for obviously there must be shafts, bearings,
and in the present case there were also gears; and all of these parts
must necessarily be phenomenally heht, while all of the materials
must be capable of withstanding repeated and constant strains far
beyond their elastic limit. It is also evident to anyone having famil-
larity with such constructions that it is most difficult to keep the
various bearings, shafts, gears, ete., in proper alignment without
adding excessive weight, and also that when these various parts once
get out of alignment when subject to strain, the disasters which are
caused render them unfit for further use.

The engines themselves were successfully completed before the close
of 1901, and were of much more power than those originally designe:
but nearly a year and a half had been spent not only in their con:ple-

.

tion, but in properly coordinating the various parts of the fraine
carrying them, repairing the various breakages, assembling, dis-
mounting, and reassembling the various parts of the appliances, and
in general rebuilding the frame and appurtenances to correspond in
strength to the new engines.

There are innumerable other details, for the whole question is one
of details. I may, however, particularly mention the carburetors,
which form an essential part of every gas engine, and such giving
fair satisfaction for use in automobiles were on the market at the
time, yet all of them failed to properly generate gas when used in
the tests of the engine working in the aerodrome frame, chiefly
because of the fact that the movement of the engine in this hght
frame must be constant and regular or the transmission appliances
are certain of distortion. It was, therefore, necessary to devise car-
buretors for the aerodrome engines which would meet the required
conditions, and more than half a dozen were constructed which were
in advance of anything then on the market, and yet were not good
enough to use in the aerodrome, before a satisfactory one was made.
These experiments were made in the shop, but with an imitation of
all the disturbing influences which would be met with in the actual
use of the machine in the air, so as to make certain, as far as possible,
that the first test of the machine in free flight would not be marred
by mishaps or unseen contingencies in connection with the genera-
tion and use of power.

It is impossible for anyone who has not had experience with such
ynatters to appreciate the great amount of delay which experience
has shown is to be expected in such experiments. Only in the spring
of 1903, and after two unforeseen years of assiduous labor, were
these new engines and their appurtenances, weighing altogether less
than 5 pounds to the horsepower and far lighter than any known to
be then existing, so coordinated and adjusted that successive shop
tests could be made without causing injury to the frame, its bearings,
shafts, or propellers.

And now everything seemed to be as nearly ready for an experi-
inent as could be, until the aerodrome was at the location at which
the experiments were to take place. The large machine and its
quarter-size counterpart were accordingly placed on board the large
house boat, which had been completed some time before and had been
kept in Washington as an auxiliary shop for use in the construction
work, and the whole outfit was towed to a point in the Potomac
River, here 3 miles wide, directly opposite Widewater, Va., and
about 40 miles below Washington and midway between the Mary-
land and Virginia shores, where the boat was made fast to moorings
which had previously been placed in readiness for it.

Although extreme delays had already occurred, yet they were not
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME. TL

so trying as the ones which began immediately after the work was
thus transferred to the lower Potomac.

The object in constructing the quarter-size counterpart of the
large machine was to duplicate in it the balancing and relative pro-
portions of power, surface, ete., that had been arranged in the large
one, so that a test of it might be made which would determine
whether the large machine should be tried as arranged or the bal-
ancing and other arrangements modified. The launching appa-
‘atus, which had proved so eminently successful with the original
steam-driven models in 1896, was considered a thing so well tested
that it had, as T have stated, been duplicated on a suitable scale for
use with the large aerodrome, and it was felt that if this apparatus
were exactly similar to the smaller one it would be the one appliance
least hkely to mar the experiments.

In order to test the quarter-size model it was necessary to remove
its launching track from the top of the small house boat and place it
upon the deck of the large boat, in order to have all the work go on
at one place, as it was impossible, on account of its unseaworthiness,
to moor the small house boat in the middle of the river.

While this transfer of the launching apparatus from the smail
boat to the large one was being made, the changed atmospheric con-
ditions incident to a large body of water over which thick fogs hung
2 great portion of the time, from those of a well-protected shop on
the land, began to manifest themselves in such ways as the rusting of
the metal parts and fittings, and the consequent disarrangement oi
the adjustment of the necessarily very accurate pieces of apparatus
connected with the ignition system of the engine. These difficulties
might have partly been anticipated, but there were others concerning
which the cause of the deterioration and disarrangement of certaim
parts and adjustments was not immediately detected, and conse-
quently when short preliminary shop tests of the small machine were
attempted just prior to launching it, it was found that the apparatus
did not work properly, necessitating repairs and new constructions
and consequent delay. Although the large house boat with the entire
outfit had been moved down the river on July 14, 1908, it was not
until the 8th of August that the test of the quarter-size model was
made, and all of this delay was directly due to changed atmospheric
conditions incident to the change in locality. This test of the model
in actual flight was made on the 8th of August, 1903, when it worked
most satisfactorily, the launching apparatus, as always heretofore,
performing perfectly, white the model, being launched directly into
the face of the wind, flew directly ahead on an even keel. The bal-
ancing proved to be perfect, and the power, supporting surface,
zuiding, and equilibrium-preserving effects of the rudder also. ‘The
120 EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME.

weight of the model was 58 pounds, its sustaining surface 66 square
feet, and the horsepower from 24 to 3.

This was the first time in history, so far as I know, that a success-
ful flight of a mechanically sustained flying machine was made in
public.

The flight was not as long as had been expected, as it was found
afterwards that one of the workmen, in his zeal to insure an especially
good one, had overfilled the gasoline tank, which would otherwise
have enabled a flight several times as long. However, as such a
tight would have given absolutely no more data than the short one
did, and as the delays in getting ready for testing the large machine
had already far exceeded what was expected, it was thought best not
to make any more tests with the small one, as all cf the data which
was desired had been procured, and it was accordingly stored away
snd every energy immediately concentrated in getting the large ma-
chine ready for its first test, which at that time seemed only a few
days away.

During all these delays it may be remarked that we necessarily
resided near the house boat, and therefore in a region of malaria, from
whose attacks a portion of us suffered.

I have spoken of the serious delays in the test of the small machine
caused by changed atmospheric conditions, but they proved to be
almost negligible compared with what was later experienced with
the large one. I have also alluded to the fact that the necessarily
light ribs of the large sustaining wing surfaces were covered with
several coats of a special marine varnish which many tests had shown
enabled the glue to withstand submersion in water for more than
twenty-four hours without being affected. This water test was made
with a view to guarding against the joints of the ribs being softened
when the machine came down into the water, as it was planned for
it to do at the close of its flight, and these submersions had apparently
shown that no trouble need be anticipated from the effects of the
sustaining surfaces getting wet. It is an instance of the unpre-
dictable delays which present themselves, that when preparations
had been begun for the immediate trial of the large machine, already
down the river, it was found that every one of the cross ribs had
been rendered almost useless by the damp, though under shelter.
As it would take months to build new ones, a temporary means of
repairing them was used. There were other delays too numerous
to mention, but chiefly incident to working over the water, some of
the principal of which were due to storms dragging the house boat
from its moorings and destroying auxilary apparatus, such as
launches, boats, rafts, ete., to say nothing of the time consumed in
bringing workmen to and from the scene of the experiments. The
propellers were even found to break under the strain of the actual
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME. Tot

engines in the open, though they had not done so in the shop, and this
is mentioned as another instance of the numerous causes of trying
delay which it was impossible to foresee.

Finally, however, on the 8d of September, everything seemed to
be in readiness for the experiments, and the large aerodrome was
accordingly placed in position and all orders given and arrangements
made for a test that day. After stationing the various tugs, launches,
ete., at their predetermined positions so that they might render any
assistance necessary to the engineer or the aerodrome, in case it came
down in the water at a point distant from the house boat, and after
the photographers, with special telephoto cameras, had been  sta-
tioned on the shore in order that photographs with their trigonomet-
rical data might be obtained, from which speed, distance, ete., might
be later determined, and when everyone was anxiously expecting
the experiment, a delay occurred from one of the hardly predictable
‘auses just mentioned in connection with the weather. An attempt
was made to start the engine so that it might be running at its proper
‘rate when the aerodrome was launched into free air after leaving
the track, but the dry batteries used for sparking the engine, together
with the entire lot of several dozen which were on hand as a reserve,
had become useless from the dampness.

I have merely instanced some of these causes of failure when every-
thing was apparently ready for the expected test, but only one who
was on the spot and who had interest in the outcome could appre-
ciate trials of this sort, and the delays of waiting for weather suitable
for experiments.

It was found that every storm which came anywhere in the vicinity,
immediately selected the river as its route of travel, and although
a 10-mile wind on the land would not be an insurmountable obstacle
during an experiment, yet the same wind on the river rendered it
impossible to maintain the large house boat on an even keel and free
from pitching and tossing long enough to make a test.

While speaking of the difficulties imposed by the weather, it should
also be understood that to take the aerodrome in parts from under the
shelter of the roof and assemble and mount it upon the upper works
was a task requiring four or five hours, and that during this time a
change in the weather was altogether likely to occur, and did _ re-
peatedly occur, sufficient to render the experiment impossible. Expe-
rience has shown, then, that the aerodrome should be sheltered by a
building, in which it shall be at all times ready for immediate launch-
ing. During all the delay resulting from this and other causes
since it was never known on what day the experiment might take
place—a great expense for tug boats waiting at a distance of 40
miles from the city, was incurred, and this was a part of the con-

132 EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME.

tinuous drain on the pecuniary resources, which proved ultimately
more fatal than any mishap to the apparatus itself.

Following the 3d of September, and after procuring new batteries,
short preliminary tests inside the boat were made in order to make
sure that there would be no difficulty in the running of the engine
the next time a fair opportunity arrived for making a test of the
machine in free flight. Something of the same troubles which had
been met with in the disarrangement of the adjustments of the small
engine was experienced in the large one, although they occurred in
such a different way that they were not detected until they had caused
damage in the tests, and these disarrangements were responsible for
broken propellers, twisted shafts, crushed bearings, distorted frame-
work, ete., which were not finally overcome until the Ist of October.
After again getting everything in apparent readiness, there then
ensued a period of waiting on the weather until the 7th of October
(1903), when it became sufficiently quiet for a test, which I was now
beginning to fear could not be made before the following season. In
this, the first test, the engineer took his seat, the engine started with
ease and was working without vibration at its full power of over
50 horse, and the word being given to launch the machine, the car
was released and the aerodrome sped along the track. Just as the
machine left the track, those who were watching it, among whom
were two representatives of the Board of Ordnance,’ noticed that the
machine was jerked violently down at the front (being caught, as
it subsequently appeared, by the falling ways),’ and under the full
power of its engine was pulled into the water, carrying with it its
engineer. When the aerodrome rose to the surface it was found,
that while the front sustaining surfaces had been broken by their
impact with the water, yet the rear ones were comparatively unin-
jured. As soon as a full examination of the launching mechanism
had been made, it was found that the front portion of the machine
had caught on the launching car, and that the guy post, to which were
fastened the guy wires which are the main strength of the front
surfaces, had been bent to a fatal extent.

«¢ Major Macomb, of the Board of Ordnance, states in his report to the
Board, that “the trial was unsuccessful because the front guy post caught in
its support on the launching car and was not released in time to give free) flight,
as was intended, but, on the contrary, caused the front of the machine to be
dragged downward, bending the guy post and making the machine plunge into
the water about 50 yards in front of the house boat.”

bThis instantaneous photograph, taken from the boat itself and hitherto
unpublished, shows the aerodrome in motion before it had actually cleared
the house boat. On the left is seen a portion of a beam, being a part of the
falling ways in which the front wing was caught, while the front wing itself
is seen twisted, showing that the accident was in progress before the aerodrome
was free to fly.
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME. Pe

The machine, then, had never been free in the air, but had been
pulled down as stated.

The disaster Just’ brietly described had indefinitely postponed the
test, but this was not all. As has been said before, the weather had
become very cold and the so-called equinoctial storms being near it
was decided to remove the house boat at the earliest time possible,
but before it could be done, a storm came up and swept away all the
launches, boats, rafts, ete., and in doing so completely demolished the
greater part of them, so that when the house boat was finally removed
to Washington, on the 15th of October, these appurtenances had to be
replaced. It is necessary to remember that these long series of delays
worked other than mere scientific difficulties, for a more important
and more vital one was the exhaustion of the financial means for the
work.

Immediately upon getting the boat to Washington the labor of
constructing new sustaining surfaces was begun, and they were com-
pleted about the close of November. It was proposed to make a
second attempt near the city, though in the meantime the ice had
formed in the river. However, on the 8th of December, 1903, the
atmosphere became very quiet shortly before noon and an immediate
attempt was made at Arsenal Point, quite near Washington, though
the site was unfavorable. Shortly after arriving at the selected
point everything was in readiness for the test. In the meantime
the wind had arisen and darkness was fast approaching, but as the
funds for continuing the work were exhausted, rendering it Impos-
sible to wait until spring for more suitable weather for making «
test, it was decided to go on with it if possible. This time there
were on hand to witness the test the writer, members of the Board
of Ordnance, and a few other guests, to say nothing of the hundreds
of spectators who were waiting on the various wharves and shores.
It was found impossible to moor the boat without a delay which
would mean that no test could be made on account of darkness, so
that it was held as well as possible by a tug, and kept with the
aerodrome pointing directly into the wind, though the tide, which
was running very strong, and the wind, which was blowing 10 miles
an hour, were together causing much difficulty. The engine being
started and working most satisfactorily, the order was given by
the engineer to release the machine, but just as it was leaving the
track another disaster, again due to the launching ways, occurred.

4Major Macomb again states in his official report to the Board: ‘ The
launching car was released at 4.45 p.m. * * * The car was set in motion
and the propellers revolved rapidly, the engine working perfectly, but there
was something wrong with the launching. The rear guy post seemed to drag,
bringing the rudder down on the launching ways, and a crashing, rending
sound, followed by the collapse of the rear wings, showed that the machine had
been wrecked in the launching; just how it was impossible to see.”

.
124 EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME.

This time the rear of the machine, in some way still unexplained,
was caught by a portion of the launching car, which caused the rear
sustaining surfaces to break, leaving the rear entirely without sup-
port, and it came down almost vertically into the water. Dark-
ness had come before the engineer, who had been in extreme danger,
could aid in the recovery of the aerodrome, the boat and machine
had drifted apart, and one of the tugs, in its zeal to render assist-
ance, had fastened a rope to the frame of the machine in the reverse
position from what it should have been attached and had broken the
frame entirely in two. While the injury which had thus been caused
seemed almost irreparable to one not acquainted with the work, yet
it was found upon close examination that only a small amount of
labor would be necessary in order to repair the frame, the engine
itself being entirely uninjured. Had this accident occurred at an
earlier period, when there were funds available for continuing the
experiments, it would not have been so serious, for many accidents
in shop tests had occurred which, while unknown to the general pub-
lic, had yet caused greater damage and required more time for repair
than in the present case. But the funds for continuing the work were
exhausted, and it being found impossible to immediately secure
others for continuing it, it was found necessary to discontinue the
experiments for the present, though I decided to use, from a private
fund, the small amount of money necessary to repair the frame so that
it itself, together with its engine, which was entirely uninjured, might
be available for further use if it should later prove possible, and
that they themselves might be in proper condition to attest to what
they really represent as an engineering achievement.

Entirely erroneous impressions have been given by the account
of these experiments in the public press, from which they have been
judged, even by experts; the impression being that the machine
could not sustain itself in flight. It seems proper, then, to emphasize
and to reiterate, with a view to what has just been said, that the
machine has never had a chance to fly at all, but that the failure
occurred on its launching ways; and the question of its ability to fly
is consequently, as yet, an untried one.

There have, then, been no failures as far as the actual test of the
flying capacity of the machine is concerned, for it has never been
free in the air at all. The failure of the financial means for continu-
ing these expensive experiments has left the question of their result
where it stood before they were undertaken, except that it has been
demonstrated that engines can be built, as they have been, of little
over one-half the weight that was assigned as the possible minimum
by the best builders of I'rance and Germany; that the frame can be
made strong enough to carry these engines, and that, so far as any
possible prevision can extend, another flight would be successful if
EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LANGLEY AERODROME. 125

the launching were successful; for in this, and in this alone, as far
as is known, all the trouble has come.

The experiments have also given necessary information about this
launching. They have shown that the method which succeeded per-
feetly on a smaller scale is insufficient on a larger one, and they have
indicated that it is desirable that the launching should take place
nearer the surface of the water, either from a track upon the shore
or from a house boat large enough to enable the apparatus to be
launched at any time with the wings extended and perhaps with
wings independent of support from guys. But the construction of
this new launching apparatus would involve further considerable
expenditures that there are no present means to meet; and this, and
this alone, is the cause of their apparent failure.

Failure in the aerodrome itself or its engines there has been none;
and it is believed that it is at the moment of success, and when the
engineering problems have been solved, that a lack of means has pre-
vented a continuance of the work.

RELATION OF WING SURFACE TO WEIGHT.
By R. von LENDENFELD.4@

Successive investigators, myself among them, have studied the
comparative relation between the weight and the dimensions of fly-
ing animals, with special reference to the extent of wing surface.
Some hundred species of bats, birds, and flying insects have been
examined in this way, the results of these researches being given
in the following table, in which the animals are arranged according
to weight of body.

It is seen from the foregoing table that the relation of the extent
of wing surface to the weight of body is not uniform, as might have
been expected, but exceedingly variable. For instance, to 1 gram of
weight the bustard has 62 mm? of wing surface, while the cabbage but-

terfly has 11,600. Careful observation shows, however, that 1n the main
the variation of this ratio depends on the size of the animal, or, stated in
general terms, the wings are relatively larger the smaller and lighter
the animal to which they belong. It is shown also that the variations
from the general rule depend on the fact that the mode of flight is dif-
ferent in different animals. Some flying creatures overcome weight by
the rapid movement of their wings; others, especially at the beginning
of a stroke, take advantage of the internal atmospheric currents, and
use the enormous resistance of the air for their purpose. The first
class, to which the sparrow and the honeybee belong, may be desig-
nated as flapping flyers, and the last class, of which the albatross and
the sea eagle are examples, as sailing flyers. These extreme types of
the so-called flapping and sailing flyers are connected by an unbroken
chain of flying creatures, not all of which are so exclusively either
flappers or sailers as the birds just named.

As might be expected, the flapping flyers have comparatively small
wings, which move swiftly by the aid of powerful muscles, while the
wings of the sailers are moved by weaker muscles and more slowly.
If we take these two classes into consideration separately, as in the
following tables, it is clearly shown that the wing surface increases
with decreasing weight of body.

RELATION OF WING SURFACE TO WEIGHT. 129

Of this fact there can be no doubt, and the question arises why
this is so. Miillenhoff and others who have interested themselves in
this inquiry have answered it from the morphological point of view.
From the entirely correct principle deduced from the position of
these investigators, that with increasing size the linear diminsions
increase in the first, the magnitude in the second, and the weight
in the third ratio, they conclude that the wing surface is not to be
compared directly with the weight, but the square root of this sur-
face with the cube root of the weight. In fact, however, the figures
thus obtained show no constancy, even when comparing animals of
the same mode of flight. Thus the formula Sutiace gives in the
partridge 4.03, in the sparrow 2.86, and in the bumblebee 1.33.

If, however, such a constancy existed, which we see is not the case,
the paradox that hes in the relative increase of wing surface with
decreasing weight of body would by no means be set aside; but in
similarly formed flying creatures it is not so essential that they shall
be morphologically alike as that all shall perform the task of over-
coming weight equally well, and thus be functionally the same.

In sustaining and propelling the body it thus becomes a question
of the power of the wings to press down upon the air, and this
power depends not only on their size, but in a very great degree upon
the swiftness of their movement against the air and its consequent
resistance. Hence, as is evident, the flapping flyers, whose wings
move in a comparatively small angle, have greater lifting power
the longer their wings and the more strokes they make in a second.

A sparrow has a wing length of about 10 em. and makes about 12
wing strokes in a second; a bee with a wing length of approximately
6.3 mm. makes, as Marey has shown, about 190 strokes in a second,
6.8 times 190 about equaling 100 times 12. The slow wing movement
used by the sailing birds when needed shows the same. The stork
has a wing length of 68 em. and makes 1? strokes in a second, and
the laughing gull with a wing length of 39 cm. makes 3! strokes in
the same time. In these instances also the results are not dissimilar.
In general, one may therefore say that the movement of the wings
against the air in many birds of the same mode of flight is of equal
‘apidity, this being true of the flapping flvers as well as the sailers.
Although the smaller flyers have relatively larger wings than the
greater, one can not for this reason assert that the movement of the
wing surface against the air would be slower.

In view of the biological principle that organs are not greater than
demanded by their function, we must conclude from the known facts
that the smaller animals need relatively larger wings to accomplish
what the larger and heavier attain with their relatively smaller ones.

130 RELATION OF WING SURFACE TO WEIGHT.

The fact that a wing surface of 67 mm? per gram enables the alba-
tross to sail, while the laughing gull requires 836 mm? for the same
purpose, and that the bustard gets along with 62, while the sparrow
needs 200 and the fly 1,800 mm?, can be explained only on the supposi-
tion that the resistance of the air against moving wings is not directly
proportional to their size, but that in enlarging the wings the resisting
power of the air against them increases in a greater ratio than their
superficial dimensions. Knowing that the air requires an appreciable
time to yield to the pressure of the moving wing, and that the larger
the wing surface the greater the quantity of air displaced and the
greater the resistance of this compressed air to the subsequent wing
strokes which must act upon it, it is evident that this conclusion is
correct.

There can therefore be no doubt that increasing size of body is
accompanied by a relative decrease of wing surface, and from this
fact we are able to draw interesting conclusions as to the size of the
wings a man would need to be able to fly. Tf we show the relation of
the weight to the size of the wing by the means of coordinates, con-
necting the points thus gained by a curve, and then extend this curve
as demanded by the as e weight of the heaviest animal, we secure
an approximate illustration of the wing size which such bodies would
require. Since the muscular power of a human being would by no
means suflice for flapping flight, it could only be a question of sailing
flight in this case. I have therefore drawn a curve for sailing flyers
on the principle above indicated, from which the following is
deduced :

70 kilograms, weight of body, would require 32 mniv* of wing surface per gram.

80 kilograms, weight of body, would require 31 mm’ of wing surface per gram.

90 kilograms, weight of body, would require 80 mm° of wing surface per gram.

100 kilograms, weight of body, would require 29.5 mm?’ of wing surface per gram.

According to the foregoing, 1f the combined weight of the body and
the mechanical flying apparatus amounts to 90 kilograms, in order
to sail like an albatross a man would require 90,000 times 80, or
2.700,000 mm? of wing surface; that is to say, two wings furnishing
together 2.7 square meters of surface.

OBSERVATORY .¢

INTRODUCTION.

The appleation of the spectroscope in 1868 to the observation of
solar prominences in full sunlight opened an extensive field’ of
research and directed the attention of astronomers to the importance
of applying the powerful instruments and methods of the physical
laboratory to the study of the sun. Since that time the rise and
development of stellar spectroscopy have further emphasized the
importance of solar investigation. For it can not be too often
repeated that the sun is the only star whose phenomena can be
studied in detail; in interpreting the spectroscopic phenomena of
all the other stars we must therefore return in every instance to the
sun. If its infinitely varied and complex activities were well under-
stood, the problems encountered in the study of stellar evolution
would be greatly simplified. But although the constant use of the
spectroscope, dating back to the discovery of the chemical constitu-
tion of the sun in 1859, has furnished an immense amount of valuable
information, there appears to be an exceptional opportunity at the
present time to secure new and important results, especially through
the use of the large spectroscopes and other powerful instruments
of the physical laboratory. For solar spectroscopy has by no means
kept pace with laboratory spectroscopy; few large grating spectro-
scopes, such as are found in every physical laboratory, have ever
been employed to study a large image of the sun. This being true,
it is less remarkable that other laboratory instruments not so gen-
erally available are still awaiting application in solar research.

132 RUMFORD SPECTROHELIOGRAPH.

The widespread interest in total solar eclipses and the great ex-
penditure of time and money so freely made in observing them
surely tend to emphasize what has been said. For if it is worth
while, as it certainly is, to travel thousands of miles and to undergo
hardships in order to spend a few flying seconds in making observa-
tions, it would seem no less advantageous to continue solar work at
home, where entirely new phenomena can be observed daily with
a much smaller expenditure of effort. Total eclipses of the sun will
always be of great importance, as the corona can not be observed in
full sunlight. But the study of many other solar phenomena, which
can be observed whenever the sky is clear, is quite as lkely to
advance our knowledge of the solar constitution.

It was with some such ideas in mind that the work of the Kenwood
Observatory was undertaken in 1888. It seemed obvious that even
a very shght appreciation of the subject should suffice to render
possible some improvements of method. <A first step in this direc-
tion was attempted by the invention of the spectroheliograph in
1889. The original purpose of this instrument was the photography
of the chromosphere and prominences, in order to simplify and ren-
der more accurate the daily delineation of their form. It was subse-
quently found, as will be shown in the present paper, that the instru-
ment had a far wider range of application, and that it could be
applied in directions which had not suggested themselves in 1889.

The principle of the spectroheliograph is exceedingly simple.
Imagine a direct-vision spectroscope in which the eyepiece ordina-
rily employed is replaced by a (second) slit. If an image of the sun
is formed on the first sht of this spectroscope, the second sht will
permit the passage of only a narrow region of the spectrum corre-
sponding in width to this slit. If the sht is now moved until it coin-
cides with the Hf line, for example, only hydrogen light will pass
through the instrument. If, then, a photographic plate is placed
behind and almost in contact with the second slit, and the spectro-
scope is moved at right angles to its optical axis, an image of the
sun, in monochromatic hydrogen light, will be built up on the plate
from the successive images of the slit. If the exposure is suitable,
the chromosphere and prominences will be shown surrounding this
image.

Such is the spectroheliograph in its simplest form. It is obvi-
ously immaterial whether the motion be given to the spectroscope,
on the one hand, or to the solar image and photographic plate, on the
other. It is only necessary that the relative motion of the solar
image and first slit be such that light from all parts of the solar disk
shall pass successively through the slit, while the photographic plate
and second slit experience a corresponding relative motion. The
second slit serves simply to isolate any desired line in the spectrum;
RUMFORD SPECTROHELIOGRAPH. 130

hence its width must be such as exactly to include this line and to
exclude all light from ether parts of the spectrum. It is: evident
that the spectroheliograph may be considered simply as a form of
monochromatic exposing shutter, differing from the ordinary focal
plane shutter only through the use of a narrower exposing slit and
the inclusion of an optical train which limits the light to a single
line in the spectrum.

Although this idea suggested itself to me quite independently in
1889, I subsequently learned that the principle was by no means new.
Indeed, Janssen had suggested it as early as 1869, while Braun, of
Kaloesa, and Lohse, of Potsdam, had designed instruments involv-
ing the same principle in 1872 and 1880, respectively. Indeed,
Lohse had constructed and experimented with the instrument he de-
signed, but his work was not successful. This may have been due
in part to the fact that the hydrogen ne which he employed is not
nearly so well adapted for prominence photography as are the H.
and K lines of calcium. This was one of the difficulties experienced
in my first (unsuccessful) experiments, which, through the kindness
of Professor Pickering, were made at the Harvard College Observa-
tory in the winter of 1889-1890.

In April, 1891, after the Kenwood Observatory had been equipped
with a 12-inch equatorial refractor and a powerful solar spectroscope,
a photographic study of the ultra-violet spectrum of the chromosphere
and prominences was undertaken in the hope of finding lines better
adapted than those of hydrogen for the photography of the promi-
nences. The brilliant H and K lines of calcium, previously observed
visually in full sunlight by Professor Young and photographically at
total eclipses, were found in all cases to be the most conspicuous lines
in the spectrum of the chromosphere and prominences. The remark-
able brightness of these lines, and more particularly their position at
the center of the dark, broad shades, due to the denser calcium vapor
in the lower portion of the solar atmosphere, render them peculiarly
well adapted for the purposes of prominence photography. Indeed,
it was possible with their aid to obtain good photographs of single
prominences merely by opening the slit of the spectroscope to such an
extent as to include a considerable part of the prominence and giving
a very short exposure to the image formed directly upon a photo-
graphic plate. But this method was too limited to be of general
application. In order to record photographically the entire surface
of the sun, with the chromosphere and prominences, it Was necessary
to employ the principle of the spectrohehograph, involving the use
of narrow slits, moved with reference to the solar image and photo-
graphic plate. The first successful spectroheliograph was brought
into use at the Kenwood Observatory in January, 1892. After this
time it was employed regularly on every clear day until May, 1895,
134 RUMFORD SPECTROHELIOGRAPH.

soon after which the instruments of the Kenwood Observatory were
removed to the Yerkes Observatory.

My spectroscopic studies of the sun during the spring and summer
of 1891 were not confined to the chromosphere and prominences. It
was found that the H and K lines, previously recognized as no less
characteristic of the prominences than the hydrogen lines themselves,
were reversed from dark to bright in regions scattered all over the
solar disk. This fact had not escaped the attention of Professor
Young, who had long before remarked the presence of these lines in
the neighborhood of active sun spots. But the greater delicacy of the
photographic processes showed these bright lines to characterize very
extensive regions on the sun’s surface, not confined to the immediate
neighborhood of spots, but scattered throughout the sun-spot zones,
and even extending from pole to pole. It was noticed from the out-
set that these bright regions corresponded closely with the well-known
tacule, and in my earher work they were called by this name. It has
since become clear, however, that a distinctive term should be adopted,
and I now propose the name “ floccul ” for the regions on the sun’s
disk which are shown only on photographs made with the spectro-
heliograph.

The possibility of photographing these bright regions on the sun’s
disk with the spectroheliograph at once greatly extended the range
of that instrument, as it was thus shown to be capable of recording,
not only the prominences, which could be observed, though very
laboriously, by visual methods, but also extensive and important
phenomena invisible to the eye and not shown on photographs taken
in the ordinary manner. Spectroheliographs were accordingly
adopted for use at other observatories, first by Mr. Evershed in Eng-
land, and subsequently (in 1893) by M. Deslandres at the Paris Ob-
servatory. Both of these spectroscopists introduced modifications
and improvements of the instrument, Mr. Evershed constructing a
direct-vision spectroheliograph of remarkable simplicity and beauty,
and M. Deslandres, with a different type of instrument, obtaining
photographs of great excellence.

It had been hoped and expected that the interruption in the daily
series of photographs, caused by removal to the Yerkes Observatory
in 1896, would be of short duration, but unfortunately this did not
prove to be the case. The 12-inch refractor, devoted at Kenwood
entirely to solar work, was needed at the Yerkes Observatory for
general purposes. It therefore became necessary to remove the spec-
trohehograph from this telescope, and to modify the mounting in
order to adapt it for general observational work. The spectrohelio-
graph was remodeled for use with the 40-inch refractor as a solar
spectroscope, and it was expected that a new spectroheliograph, large
enough to photograph the 7-inch (17.8 em.) image at the focus of
RUMFORD SPECTROHELIOGRAPH. foo

this telescope, would soon be ready for use. But the funds required
for the construction of*the new spectroheliograph were not forth-
coming, and when it finally became possible to undertake work on
this instrument (through a grant from the Rumford fund, and the
gifts of friends of the observatory) progress was slow, owing to the
limited funds available. For a 7-inch solar image, collimator and
camera lenses of about 10 inches (25.4 em.) aperture were needed ;
but the considerable cost of such lenses rendered their purchase
impossible, and a pair of 64-inch (15.7 cm.) Voigtlinder portrait
lenses. obtained from second-hand dealers after a year’s search, were
adopted. With lenses of this aperture it is evident that much heht
must be lost at the extremities of the slit, and that the resulting image
of the sun must therefore be deficient in brightness at the correspond-
ing limbs. Even after the lenses had been secured, the demands of
other phases of the observatory’s work greatly retarded the construc-
tion of the instrument, and it was not until the latter part of 1899
that it was ready for trial* * *

PRELIMINARY ACCOUNT OF RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE RUMFORD
SPECTROHELIOGRAPH.

Prior to 1903 the Rumford spectroheliograph was used for experi-
mental purposes, the numerous photographs obtained during the sun-
spot minimum being of service mainly in perfecting the adjustments
of the instrument. It had been expected that the spectroheliograph
would be transfered from the 40-inch refractor to the 30-inch coelostat
reflector for the purposes of the daily record; but the destruction of
the latter instrument by fire in December, 1902, prevented the reali-
zation of this plan.’ The work with the 40-inch refractor was accord-
ingly resumed in February, 1903, and since the latter part of that
month photographs of the calcium floeculi have been made on each
clear day (Sundays usually excepted). Since early in April this
series has been supplemented by a daily series of (low-level) photo-
graphs, made with the slit set at some distance from the center of the
H or K band, and since May 16 photographs have been made as often
as possible with the Hf line. In addition to this routine work many
photographs of special regions have been taken in a study of the
ealecium vapor at various levels, and some results have also been
obtained with the calcium line A 4,226.9, the iron line 44,383.7, and
with various other dark lines. It will thus be seen that while the
material represented by the photographs obtained with the Rumford

spectroheliograph is not yet sufficient for extended generalizations,
the variety of phenomena recorded is such as to call for some comment
here. A more complete discussion of the results must be reserved
for a future occasion.

ON THE NATURE OF THE CALCIUM FLOCCULI.

In my first published note on the bright calcium regions recorded
for the first time with the Kenwood spectroheliograph I briefly
described the results in the following words:

The reversed regions are of great extent and in appearance closely resemble
facule. Several explanations may be suggested to account for them. They
may be:

1.. Ordinary prominences projected on the disk.

2. Prominences in which H and K are bright, while the hydrogen lines are
absent.

3. Facule.

4. Phenomena of a new class, similar to faculze, but showing H and K bright,
and not obtained in eye observations or ordinary photographs because of the
brilliant background upon which they are projected.¢

Tt was subsequently shown that the bright calcium regions in gen-
eral coincide closely with the facule, and it was concluded that they
represent the hot calcium vapor in the upper part of the facule and
in the lower part of the adjoining chromosphere. Fig. 1, plate m1,
which is reproduced from a photograph of the K line taken at Ken-
wood Observatory, shows that the bright reversals of the K line fre-
quently occur in regions of the disk where the continuous spectrum is
considerably strengthened. These regions are the facule proper.
The facule, though apparently but little brighter than the photo-
sphere, are conspicuously visible near the sun’s limb, This is prob-
ably due to the fact that they reach a higher level, and thus escape
much of the general absorption exercised by a comparatively thin
stratum of a smoke-like nature which lies in close contact with the
photosphere. The facule are, in general, the regions above which
the calcium vapor is hottest and most brilliant.

But it appeared later that the calcium vapor is not confined to the
facule, but extends beyond their boundaries and frequently occurs in
regions of the solar disk where they are absent. ‘The generally close
coincidence of the caleium clouds with the facule, and a natural hesi-
tation to propose a new name before the results obtained with the
spectroheliograph had been sufficiently studied, led me to apply this
term to the bright calcium regions photographed with the spectro-
heliograph. From my present point of view I think it would have
tended to clearness, as M. Deslandres has pointed out, 1f some other
name had been adopted.

aAstronomy and Astrophysics, Vol. IT (1892), p. 159.
RUMFORD SPECTROHELIOGRAPH. 187

M. Deslandres’s Jatest explanation of the calcium regions is un-
doubtedly more nearly correct than my earlier one, though at the time
I did not appreciate this. His solar investigations at the Paris Ob-
servatory were confined for some years to the photography of the
spectrum of various parts of the sun’s disk, but in 1894 he undertook
work with the spectroheliograph. The bright reversals of the H and
KX lines photographed by M. Deslandres on the sun’s disk were at
first considered by him to represent the prominences; later he
ascribed them to bright regions at the base of the prominences, and
finally he spoke of them as the brighter regions at the base of the
chromosphere projected on the disk. This last designation now
appears to me to describe the facts much more accurately than the
term “ facule ” (meaning calcium vapor of the facule) at first em-
ployed by myself. In suggesting the term flocculi (flocculus, dim. of
floccus, “a bit of wool”) to distinguish the vaporous clouds phote-
graphed on the disk from the underlying facule, I have distinctly
avoided the use of a name which might in any sense be taken as indi-
cating the nature of the phenomena. A glance at plate mr will show
that the word is more or less descriptive of the photographs, so far as
their appearance is concerned.“

It is necessary to speak of calcium floeculi, hydrogen floccuh, ete.,
as the photographs show that the forms of the various vapors in the
same part of the disk are not identical. Some of the phenomena com-
prised under this name are undoubtedly prominences seen in projec-
tion, but most of them correspond to much lower levels, near the base
of the chromosphere, or within the reversing layer.

MINUTE STRUCTURE OF THE FLOCCULI.

The extensive literature which embodies the long discussion regard-
ing the “ willow leaf” and “ rice grain ” structure of the photosphere
has in large part become obsolete since the publication of Langley’s
important paper “ On the minute structure of the solar photosphere,”
and of Janssen’s excellent photographs, now generally accessible in
the first volume of the Annals of the Observatory of Meudon. After
speaking of the cloud-like character of the photosphere, Langley goes
on to describe the more minute details in the following words: ?

Under high powers used in favorable moments, the surface of any one of the
fleecy patches is resolved into a congeries of small, intensely bright bodies, irreg-
ularly distributed, which seem to be suspended in a comparatively dark mediun,
and whose definiteness of size and outline, although not absolute, is yet striking
by contrast with the vagueness of the cloud-forms seen before, and whieh we
now perceive to be due to their aggregation. The “ dots” seen before are con-

photographs.

siderable openings caused by the absence of the white nodules at certain points,
and the consequent exposure of the gray medium which forms the general back-
ground. These openings have been called pores; their variety of size makes
any measurements nearly valueless, though we may estimate in a very rough
way the diameter of the more conspicuous at from 2” to 4”. The bright
nodules are themselves not uniformly bright (some being notably more brilliant
than their fellows and eyen unequally bright in portions of the same nodule).
neither are they uniform in shape. They have just been spoken of as relatively
definité in outline, but this outline is commonly found to be irregular on minute
study, while it yet affects, as a whole, an elongated or oval contour. Mr. Stone
has called them ‘ rice grains,’ a term only descriptive of their appearance with
an aperture of 3 to 4 inches, but which I will use provisionally. It depicts their
whiteness, their relative individuality, and their approximate form, but not their
irregular outline, nor a certain tendency to foliate structure which is character-
istic of them, and which has not been sufficiently remarked upon. This irregu-
larity and diversity of outline have been already observed by Mr. Huggins.
Estimates of the main size of these bodies vary very widely. Probably Mr.
Huggins has taken a judicious mean in averaging their longer diameter at 17.5
and their shorter at 1”, while remarking that they are occasionally between 2”
and 8”, and sometimes less than 1”, in length.

“cc

* * %& Tn moments of rarest definition I have resolved these “ rice grains”
into minuter Components, sensibly round, which are seen singly as points of light,
and whose aggregation produces the “ rice-grain”’ structure. These minutest
bodies, which I will call granules, it will appear subsequently, can hardly equal
0.73 in diameter, and are probably less.

* & > Tt seems to me that there is no room for doubt that “ filaments ” and
“oranules ” are names for different aspects of the same thing; that filaments in
reality are floating vertically all over the sun, their upper extremities appearing
at the surface as granules, and that in spots we only see the general structure
of the photosphere, as if in section, owing to the filaments being here inclined.

* * * Speaking without reference to spectroscopic investigations, it seems
to me that we have in the behavior of our filaments a presumption as to the
existence of ascending currents in the outer penumbra, and of both ascending
and descending currents at the umbral edge; ascending ones being the more
usual.

,

An examination of the minute calcium floceuli photographed with
the Rumford spectroheliograph will show that they closely resemble
the photospheric “ grains” described by Langley and illustrated in
Janssen’s photographs. Plate v1 is reproduced from one of our nega-
tives on the scale chosen for the majority of the photographs in Vol-
ume I of the Meudon Annals. This photograph was made with the
slit set at the center of the H line on a day when the seeing was par-
ticularly good. In fig. 3, pl. m1, squares 10 seconds of are on a
side are shown. These permit of an accurate determination of the
size of the individual elements of the structure. Measurements made
on our best negatives show that the minute calcium floceuli range in
diameter from less than 1 second to several seconds of are, thus cor-
responding closely with the “ grains ” of the photosphere.

On the working hypothesis at present employed to interpret the
results obtained with the Rumford spectroheliograph, it is considered
RUMFORD SPECTROHELIOGRAPH. 139

that these minute floceuli are columns of caletum vapor, rising above
the columns of condensed vapors of which the photospheric * grains ”
are the summits.

On such an assumption it becomes interesting to inquire whether
the larger calcium flocculi are made up of similar columns of calcium
‘vapor. Asa rule, the seeing is hardly good enough to permit a deci-
sion to be reached on this point. But under the best conditions there
appears to be distinct evidence of a filamentary structure, the fila-
ments seeming to spread out like the branches of a tree (fig. 2, pl. v).
Tt is evident that much light could be thrown on the question if it
were possible to photograph sections of the flocculi at different cleva-
tions above the photosphere, since in this way the form and size of
distinet columns of ealeium vapor, if such were present, could be
determined at different levels.

FORM AND EXTENT OF CALCIUM FLOCCULI AT VARIOUS ELEVATIONS ABOVE
THE PHOTOSPHERE.

Fortunately, it is possible to accomplish this very result, if the
present mode of explaining the photographs may be regarded as
sound. We hive already had occasion to consider some of the charac-
teristics of the H and K reversals of the chromosphere. In the solar
spectrum itself the appearance of the H and K lines clearly indicates
that calcium vapor occurs under widely different conditions of inten-
sity at various levels above the photosphere. It is a well-known fact
that if a considerable quantity of caletum vapor is introduced into an
electric are, broad bands, bright in the center and fading toward
both edges, will appear at the position of the TT and IX lines (fig. 2,
pl. ur).¢. The width of the bands may be taken as an approximate
measure of the density of the calcium vapor, which decreases toward
the outer part of the are, where the bands are reduced to narrow lines.
The narrow dark lines at the center of the bright bands are caused by
the absorption of the comparatively cool and rare calcium vapor in
the outer part of the are.

A similar condition of things undoubtedly exists in the sun. In
the first place, we have broad diffuse dark bands in the solar spectrum
at H and K, produced by comparatively dense calcium vapor close
to the photosphere. For convenience of reference these bands will
be called H, and K,. As the bright reversals at the base of the
chromosphere, when photographed at the sun’s limb with a tan-
gential slit, or at a total eclipse, are much narrower than these bands,
it may be concluded that the dense calcium vapor in the chromo-

horizontal telescope. The grating temporarily employed gives strong ghosts,
which are conspicuous in the photograph.

sphere lies beneath the lowest level that can be observed at the limb.
On the basis of Kirchhoff’s law, the comparative darkness of these
bands in the solar spectrum would be ascribed to the fact that the
ealcium vapor which they represent is cooler than the photosphere
below it. With increasing elevation, in a region of lower pressure,
the density of the vapor decreases, and to this decrease of density
there corresponds a decrease in the width of the bands. In the lowest
portion of the chromosphere that can be observed at the sun’s limb
the density of the vapor is so far reduced that the broad and diffuse
bands are replaced by fairly well-defined lines (H,, K,), which main-
tain their width up to a certain elevation in the chromosphere and
then grow narrower, thinning out to much narrower lines (H,, K,)
in the upper chromosphere and prominences (fig. 2a, pl m). On
the disk H, and K, appear as fairly narrow dark lines at the center
of the broad H, and K, bands. They occur in practically all parts
of the disk, but differ greatly in intensity in different regions. Every
bright calcium flocculus on the disk is characterized by the presence
of bright H, and K, lines at the center of H, and K,, with narrow
dark H., and K, lines, due to the absorption of the cooler and rarer
vapor in the upper chromosphere superposed upon them. Intensity
curves showing these peculiarities of the H and K lines are given by
Jewell in the Astrophysical Journal, mr (1896), page 100, where the
displacements of the lines are also discussed. They are also illus-
trated in the photographs reproduced in plates 1 and 11.

From a strict application of Kirchhoff’s law it would appear that
the calcium vapor in the lower chromosphere is actually hotter than
the calcium vapor which hes above and below it. It seems improb-
able that the law can be rigorously applied in this case, and hence it
may be necessary to attribute the strong radiation of the intermediate
layer to causes other than temperature alone.

In view of the composite character of the calcium lines, it should
be possible with the spectroheliograph to photograph sections of
the calcium flocculi at levels corresponding to their several elements.¢
If, for example, the second slit were set at the extreme edge of K,,
the resulting photograph should show only that calcium vapor
which is dense enough to produce a line of this breadth, 1. e., a sec-
tion across the base of the calcium flocculus, should be obtained.
Under no circumstances could the upper and rarer portions of the

a Experiments of this kind were not undertaken with the Kenwood spectro-

Some of the photographs, however, apparently show low-level (IX,) phenomena,

and Mr. Eyershed informs me that his plates do likewise. M. Deslandres
made photographs with K, and K, in 1894, but T have seen no statements of
conclusions derived from a study cf the K, plates, and do not know whether
the method has since been employed at Meuden.

flocculus be shown on such a photograph, since the line they produce
is not broad enough to enter the second sht. If the sht were set
nearer to the center of the line the photograph should represent
a section of the flocculus corresponding to a higher level, where a
narrower line is produced. It is evident that while none of the
higher and rarer calcium vapor could be shown in this photograph,
it might nevertheless include regions lying below it, where the
calcium vapor is dense enough to produce a broader line. However,
since the calcium vapor is rising from a region of high pressure to
one of a much lower pressure, it must expand as it rises, and there-
fore a section at any level should, in general, be of a larger area
than a section of the same flocculus at any lower level, As a con-
sequence of the increasing extent of the vapor with the altitude, and
the increase of brightness observed when passing from K, to K,,
a photograph corresponding to a given level is not necessarily af-
fected in any considerable degree by the existence of the denser vapor
below, except in cases where the high-level vapor does not he imme-
diately above the low-level vapor. Low-level phenomena, even
when very bright, may be wholly concealed by general excess of
radiation, or in some cases by absorption, of the caleium vapor at
high levels. Moreover, it is of course to be understood that the
term “level” is not used here in a strict sense. A section of a
large flocculus photographed with K, might, for example, correspond
to a much greater height above the photosphere than that of the
minute flocculi shown on the same photograph. It must never be for-
gotten, when examining the photographs, that composite effects
are very likely to be present.

Such considerations regarding the possibility of photographing
sections of the flocculi at different levels are borne out by the photo-
graphs, as will be seen by reference to the accompanying illustra-
tions. Plates vir and vur represent the spot group of 1903, April
29, as photographed with four different settings of the second slit.
These were taken within such time limits and in such an order that,
as no distinctly eruptive phenomena were present, the principal dif-
ferences between the photographs are therefore to be attributed to
differences in the extent and brightness of the vapor at various levels,
and not to changes going on in the sun at the time.

The assumption that these photographs represent sections of the
calcium flocculi at different elevations seems to be the simplest and
most satisfactory way of explaining the results obtained. Essen-
tially conclusive evidence in favor of this assumption is afforded by
the photographs of the recent great sun spot. (Pls. xm to xv.)

With the aid of this additional means of research we may return
to a consideration of the structure of the flocculi. It has already
been remarked that the general surface of the sun appears to be cov-

.

ered with columns of bright calcium vapor, varying in diameter
from less than a second to several seconds of arc, separated by darker
spaces, which correspond in appearance to the darker spaces that
separate the photospheric “ grains.” The summits of these columns
seem to lie in the second stratum, corresponding to the bright lines
Et, ands Ke

In the larger flocculi the surmise of a structure composed of ex-
panding columns of calcium vapor seems to be borne out by the pho-
tographs. Compare, for example, figures 1 and 2 in plate vn. At
the lower level (fig. 1) the flocculus is resolved into a series of well-
defined elements, of comparatively small area. At the higher level
(fig. 2) the area of the entire flocculus is greatly increased, and there
seems to be evidence (hardly visible in the cut) that the columns
composing it have arched over, so that they are no longer seen end
on. Few photographs are sufficiently well defined to bring out such
details, and it can not be said with certainty that the effects seen at
the higher level are always due to separation and bending of the col-
umuns, as well as to expansion of each of the individual columns. In
any event, the increase in area at this level is sometimes very great,
in many cases sufficient to cover not only the penumbra, but also
entire spots. Another illustration of the expansion at increasing
altitudes may be seen in the four photographs, corresponding to dif-
ferent levels, which are reproduced in plates vir and vit. A much
finer illustration is afforded by the photographs in plates xr to xvi
of the recent great sun spot.

HYDROGEN FLOCCULI.

The method of photographing the sun with the aid of the dark
Fraunhofer lines has already been explained. The spectroheliograph
is employed exactly as in the case of the bright calcium lines, but the
dispersion is increased sufficiently to insure that the width of the
dark lines shall be greater than that of the second slit. Under
such circumstances photographs corresponding to the hydrogen lines,
or to any other dark lines of sufficient width, may be obtained.

The first photograph made with a dark hydrogen line (17) was
taken with the Rumford spectroheliograph on May 16, 1903. On
developing the plate we were surprised to find a structure differing
materially from that obtained with H, and K,. Closer examination
and a comparison of the photograph with a K, photograph made on
the same day showed that the bright calcium flocculi were replaced
on the Zf photograph by dark structures of similar, though by no
means identical, form. There could be no doubt about the adjust-
ment of the 7 line on the second shit, since a prominence was shown
on the photograph extending above the sun’s hmb. At a point near
a sun spot a brilhant object appeared. The same bright object was
RUMFORD SPECTROHELIOGRAPH. 1438

found on a high-level K, photograph, but it did not appear on a K,
photograph. This was confirmed by other exposures.

The results given by this first photograph have been borne out in
subsequent work. It is found-that the hydrogen flocculi are in gen-
eral dark, though they are sometimes bright in disturbed regions,
usually in the neighborhood of sun spots.”

CONCLUDING REMARKS.

In concluding, we may perhaps be permitted to speak of a few of
the numerous investigations which can be undertaken by the student
of solar physics. If proper use is to be made of the numerous meth-
ods of research which are now available, a large number of investiga-
tors will be needed, working, if, possible, on some cooperative plan,
at many stations widely separated in longitude. Even the adequate
use of the spectroheliograph alone would be beyond the capacity of
any single institution, for when suitably designed this instrument will
furnish as many photographs of the sun as there are elements present
in its atmosphere, and in addition to these many others which repre-
sent the peculiarities of certain lines. For example, we have already
seen that it will be desirable to ascertain in what degree photographs
taken with enhanced lines differ from those taken with other lines of
the same element. With a large image of the sun important results
might be expected to follow from a study of photographs of sun spots
taken with the aid of the widened lines and with bright lines or other
lines which are peculiar to the spot. In view of the constant changes
which are going on in the sun, a few photographs made in any of
these ways will not suffice. What is wanted are series continued
through at least one sun-spot period, in order to discover the laws
which govern the intensity and the distribution of the various gases
and metallic vapors. Furthermore, the great importance of eruptive
phenomena, their comparative rarity, and the brief time in which all
their phases are exhibited, call for special preparations and methods
of work. Spectrohelographs capable of taking several photographs
at once through different lines will be essential for any suitable study
of eruptive phenomena. If a chain of observatories well distributed
in longitude could arrange their work so as to keep the sun almost
constantly under observation, many important eruptions which are
now lost would be recorded.

But it is by no means sufficient merely to take photographs of the
sun with the spectroheliograph. In order to extend greatly the range
of the attack, and also to explain the spectroheliograph results,

@Many additional interesting details and conclusions regarding both calcium
and hydrogen floceuli are given in the original paper and should be consulted
by the special reader.
144 RUMFORD SPECTROHELIOGRAPH.

simultaneous observations, both visual and photographic, with other
instruments are essential. For example, while a photograph is being
taken with the spectroheliograph exposures on the spectrum of the
region under investigation, for the purpose of showing the widened
lines in sun spots as well as the motions in the line of sight of the
‘alclum vapor in the floceuli, should be provided for. ‘These must
be made with an instrument of sufficient dispersion to permit the
photographs to be measured with high precision. At the same time
large scale photographs of the photosphere and spots, made by direct
photographie methods, are needed for comparison with the spectro-
heliograph results. Many bolometric studies are also required, as
well as numerous other investigations which will suggest themselves
to the reader. The essential .point is that a simultaneous attack
should be made on solar phenomena with a series of powerful instru-
ments, each designed to answer definite questions, and thus to furnish
some of the material that will be required for solving solar problems.

But such an attack, comprehensive as it might be made, would be
greatly hampered if the atmospheric conditions were not favorable.
The difference between the effects of good and bad seeing may be
seen by comparing the blurred photograph reproduced in fig. 1,
plate vi, which was the best that could be obtained at the time, with
the (larger scale) photograph reproduced in plate v1, which was
made with precisely the same instruments and adjustments at a time
when the conditions were unusually good. If such conditions as
these latter could be had day after day for long periods of time, with
occasional periods of even finer definition, many questions now out
of reach could be solved.

A report on the instrumental and atmospheric conditions needed
in future work on the sun may be found in the forthcoming Year-
book (No. 2) of the Carnegie Institution.

The shaft which is driven by the declination motor may be seen at the right. It
carries a grooved pulley near its lower end connected with a similar pulley at
the end of the camera box by means of a round leather belt. On the same shaft
with this second pulley is a spur gear, which engages with the two gears on the
projecting ends of the screws that pass through the camera box. The keys used
to operate the split nuts that clamp the plate carriage to the screws, the windows
for observing the spectrum at the middJe and at the ends of the second slit, and
the screw-drivers employed to push forward the plate holder after the slide is
withdrawn, are on the top of the camera box. At the left end of the box may
be seen the door through which the plate holder is inserted, and the narrow slid-
ing door in its outer face through which the slide is withdrawn, as well as the
micrometer heads of the screws for controlling the width of the second slit and
for moving it as a whole. The first slit, at the end of the collimator, is almost
hidden from view by the metallic screen required to shield its mounting from
the great heat of the solar image. Light reaches the first slit through a long
narrow opening in this screen. Mounted on four posts above the screen, at such
a height as to lie in the visual focal plane when the first slit is at the focus for
the K line, is a narrow metallic plate, on which a line is drawn in the direction
of dispersion. During an exposure, the limb of the Sun is made to follow this
line. At the end of the electric cable may be seen the switches used for operat-
ing the declination motor, and (just below) the rod with which the mirror in the
prism box is rotated.

lower levels. The fact that the changes are progressive largely eliminated the
time element, which might otherwise be suspected of causing the observed dif-
ferences. As a matter of fact, these flocculi are quiescent and slowly changing,
differing very decidedly from eruptive phenomena.

Fie. 2.—K, level. Slit at 3933.8. Here the calcium vapor is very brilliant
and covers a larger aren. The photograph contains distinct evidence of dark
absorbing masses at higher levels. Perhaps the best instance of this is the dark
tongue which runs somewhat north of west from the small spot south preceding
the largest one of the group. ‘This tongue seems to form a part of an extensive
dark area, which completely surrounds the bright flocculi of the group.

Fic. 1.—As remarked in the text, the contrast is too great in this photograph,
and the appearance of the brighter regions is deceptive. In reality the dark

places near the spot where bright flocculi are present.

Kia. 2.—This cut represents more nearly the appearance of the dark hydrogen
flocculi on the negatives. As the slit did not coincide with the 7 line through-
out its length, the flocculi are not shown to the west of the spot. A small bright
flocculus may be seen at the extreme edge of the figure on the left adjoining
the small spot.

ground appears too dark. The general character of the bright calcium floeculi

In this photograph the calcium vapor is much better shown than in Plate XI,
and the beginnings of eruptive phenomena have become more distinctly evident.

It is to be understood that although the changes going on in the eruptive phe-
nomena of the spot group prevent a perfect comparison of all the details of the
successive photographs in this and the subsequent series, the large masses of
flocculi change so slowly in form that they may be compared without danger of
serious error. In general, the differences between the successive pictures are
therefore due to differences in the extent and brightness of the vapor at different
levels rather than to changes in form which have taken place between exposures.
In order to render possible a satisfactory comparison of the high and low level
floceuli surrounding this spot, the matched pair of photographs, reproduced in
Plates XV, XVI, is given for examination with the stereoscope.

157
PLATE XIII.

This photograph, which represents the high-level calcium vapor, should be
compared with figs. 1 and 2, Plate X. It will be seen that at this level the
penumbra is almost completely covered, while many of the smaller spots are
blotted out. ‘There are also distinct evidences of dark floceuli, due to absorbing
yapors at still higher levels. The illustration necessarily fails to indicate the
brillianey of the brightest eruptive phenomena, which on the original negatives
are easily distinguished from the ordinary flocculi.

The difference in tevel between Plate XI and Plate XII is too great to permit
of a satisfactory study of the changes in form of the flocculi at different heights
above the photosphere. In the present series it is fortunately possible to give
an intermediate step, obtained by setting the second slit immediately outside of

This photograph is given here in the endeavor to bring out the bright
eruptive tongues, hardly to be distinguished from the less brilliant floceuli.

CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPE LENSES.
By Dr. C. FAULHABER.

The three principal instruments for the study of the heavenly
bodies are the telescope, the spectroscope, and the photographie
camera; and since the two latter are made useful only as they are
attached to the former, it is the telescope which we must still regard
as the key to unlock the doors of the universe. Readers have all
doubtless seen a large telescope, and many have had an opportunity
of looking through one, for most observatories reserve certain hours
for the public. Accordingly a description of the instrument as a
whole may be omitted, and we will merely recall that, notwithstand-
ing it is so long and heavy, complicated mechanical and electrical
means are provided for pointing and accurately guiding the telescope,
so that it follows automatically the motion of any chosen celestial!
object. But no less hard than the difficulty of providing these
mechanical adjuncts is the optical problem of providing the great
double lens called the objective at the upper end of the tube. The
objective is the fundamental part of the telescope, on whose excellence
the value of the whole instrument depends, and not only its quality
but its size also is of the highest importance to make possible the
observation of objects otherwise forever invisible. Hence it is that
telescopes are designated, not by the maximum magnification which
they can produce, nor by their length, but rather by the diameter of
their objectives. Thus one speaks of the 40-inch of the Yerkes
Observatory, the 26-inch of the Lick Observatory, and the 32-inch
Potsdam refractor.

In order to study the construction of a great telescope objective,
the attention of the reader is now invited to a great optical glass
works, of which there are but three principal ones in the world,
namely, those of Schott & Genossen, in Jena; Mantois, in Paris: and
Chance Bros. & Co., in Birmingham.

164 CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPE LENSES.

To begin the process of construction a crucible of fire-proof clay,
which already has been warmed gradually for several days, is placed
within a melting oven of peculiar construction. This oven is then
closed and slowly heated to white heat, while at the same time the
materials to compose the glass are admitted to the melting pot
through a peehole about as large as a man’s head in the wall of the
oven. .

The material varies with the kind of glass to be made. Until the
beginning of the year 1880 only twe kinds of optical glass were in use,
of which one—the so-called crown glass—wascomposed of quartz sand,
potash, soda, and calespar, and the other—the so-called flint glass—
was composed of quartz sand, potash, and lead oxide. There are now
more than 100 vareties of optical glass produced by the intermixture
of other materials, such as phosphorus, boric acid, magnesium, zinc,
barium, antimony, which are distinguished by different properties

of dispersion and refraction. The choice of the proper. glass for the
two lenses depends on the purpose which the telescope is to serve,
and particularly whether it is to be employed for visual or photo-
graphic observations.

About thirty hours is consumed in the introduction of the ma-
tirals. If there be no mishap—for sometimes at the temprature of
1,600° to 1,800° the melting pot cracks or even the stones of the oven
burst—the impurities are then skimmed off from the surface, and
for about fifteen hours the mixture is stirred by means of a hook-
shaped, white-hot clay cylinder.

When the ingredients of the glass are melted they have a tendency
to separate in layers according to their specific gravities, and thus to
destroy the homogeneity required for optical purposes. This dif-
ficulty is chiefly overcome by the continuous stirring of the melted
mixture. By repeated tests the moment is at length found when the
charge assumes the proper color and degree of fluidity. When this
moment arrives the farther side of the oven is opened and a two-
wheeled truck with long handles is backed up to the opening. Two
projecting pieces of the truck reach out under a ring which is made
for this purpose on the clay melting pot, and the latter is carefully
lifted from the floor of the oven. On account of the overflow of
melted glass, which often cements the pot to the bottom of the oven,
this is an operation involving a great risk that the fragile white-hot
clay melting pot may break, owing to the shaking required to free it
from the oven.

The melting pot is next moved over to a great circular iron mold,
and is then set down upon the floor, in order to reenforce the pot with
an iron band. On opposite sides of the iron band are steel pins
fitting on hooks attached to the truck. By means of this arrange-
ment the pot is lifted above the mold and its contents poured therein.
CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPE LENSES. 165

Contrary to what might perhaps be expected, this process is accom-
plished with little noise beyond a shght crackiing and rustling sound.
This is the culminating point in the whole process of glass making,
and gives rise not only among unaccustomed onlookers, but also
among the skilled workers themselves to mingled feelings of great
anxiety and exalted admiration.

The mold with its fiery contents is then covered with an iron
plate and pushed over to the cooling oven, which has in the mean-
while been carefully heated and opened ready to receive the charge.
Here the mold is lifted by a tackle and thrust into the cooling oven,
where, after the walls have been sealed up as tightly as possible, it
remains from four to six weeks undisturbed. Very gradual lowering
of the temperature is required, else the cooled mass might burst with
the slightest touch, or at least show prejudicial strains in the interior.

When at length the oven is opened the mold is found to contain
a solid, feebly lustrous, milk-white plate, which is easily removed
from its iron bed.

There now begins a week-long process of grinding and polishing
of the glass plate preparatory to a preliminary examination as to its
freedom from strie, bubbles, and conditions of interior strain. Ex-
perience shows that in general only a part of such a plate is of optical
value. This part is cut out by means of a glass saw and again
heated till soft in a crucible, which corresponds approximately with
the final form of the objective. After this comes a second gradual
cooling during a period of several weeks and another rough polish-
ing and testing of the quality of the resulting plate of glass.

In favorable cases the product is now ready for removal to the
optical shop, but commonly there are ten or more unfavorable trials
before securing a successful result in the manufacture of a disk of
glass for a lens of 1 meter diameter. Since, as we know, there are two
such disks of equal size required for a telescope objective, weeks and
months of further work are required for the production of the second.
The process is in all respects the same, except that somewhat different
materials are employed for the mixture, corresponding to the differ-
ences in optical properties desired. In outward appearance crown
and flint lenses do not differ much, but one is somewhat heavier than
the other.

The description just given relates to the most modern methods of
glass making as they would now be pursued at Jena in the manufac-
ture of glass disks for a telescope of 1.25 meters aperture. In the
older processes it was customary to melt a charge about three times
as large as required, and after this had reached the proper color and
consistency, to allow the melting oven to cool slowly and thus to take
the place of the special cooling oven. On opening the oven the glass
block would be found broken in several pieces, and if there was
166 CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPE LENSES.

none among these which would answer the purpose the process would
then be repeated. When a rough block of suitable size and quality
was obtained it was put in a crucible of about the proper lens form.
The whole was then again melted and cooled and then polished for
testing. As an example of the cost in time spent in this procedure, it
will be recalled that the Paris glass works required four years for the
production of the two lenses of the 36-inch Lick objective. The
inelting was done twenty times, and each time a month was spent in
the cooling. On the other hand, the Jena glass works employing the
improved processes, prepared both disks of the shghtly smaller Pots-
dam 80-centimeter objective in a few months.

It may be of interest to rehearse briefly the story of the rapid devel-
opment of the industry of optical glass making in Germany, prin-
cipally during the last ten years.

The pioneer in the production of glass for astronomical purposes,
according to purely scientific methods, was the renowned Joseph
von Fraunhofer, of Munich (1787-1826). But it is only twenty
years since Professor Abbe and the glass manufacturer, Doctor
Schott, of Jena, took up the work where Fraunhofer laid it down,
and succeeded in replacing the old flint and crown glasses by new
varieties of glass, by means of which the chromatic differences of
spherical aberration are nearly eliminated. The production of the
new glasses on a commercial scale began in the autumn of 1884. In
order to support the very costly preliminary experiments, the Prus-
sian Government made considerable grants of money in consideration
of the national value of the work. This governmental support was
required but two years, for the undertaking progressed favorably
and the productions found recognition almost immediately in the
whole optical world, so that soon not only German, but foreign
optical establishments, placed most of their orders for material in
Jena. Not only are the common crown and flint glasses made here,
but also a great number of improved crown and flint glasses, con-
taining boric and phosphoric acids, to diminish the secondary spec-
trum on the one hand, and on the other containing metallic oxides, by
means of which the dispersion and refraction may be increased or
diminished. An extensive exhibition of these products was witnessed
by the visitors who attended the Berlin Gewerbe-Ausstellung in 1896.
There were shown disks for the construction of telescopic objectives
of 110 and 125 centimeters diameter, and these were the largest pieces
of optical glass which had then been made. Not only is optical glass
produced for all kinds of instruments of precision, but also there is
made at Jena glass tubing for physical, chemical, manufacturing,
and medicinal purposes, and all sorts of chemical glassware, such as
flasks, beakers, and retorts, besides cylinders for gas and petroleum
CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPE LENSES. 167

lighting. There are now emploved in this industry about 650 per-
sons, and the value of the yearly output reaches 3,000,000 marks.

We are now prepared to trace to the further stages in the prepara-
tion of a great objective, and the attention of the reader is invited to
the optical workshop. Here the glass disks are first ground and
polished on both sides preparatory to a thorough testing. [or this
purpose there is a machine with a vertical spindle carrying an iron
plate.

Upon this plate the glass disks are in their turn cemented with
pitch, and above is a second iron plate, the grinder, provided with a
spindle in the center. By means of this spindle the grinding plate is
shoved hither and thither over the glass disk by machinery. The
grinding material is emery powder and water. After the rough
grinding is done the rough polishing on the same machine follows
similarly, excepting that the grinding tool is replaced by a cloth-
covered polishing tool, covered with rouge instead of emery.

After this preliminary work, a careful investigation of the disks is
made in the laboratory by the aid of the microscope and polarization
apparatus. If the objective is good it must appear bright im the
polariscope, with the exception of being marked by a regular dark
cross. If an irregular cross is seen or, in certain conditions, brightly
colored figures of various shapes, the disk must be returned to the
glassworks to be remelted and cooled.

In case of a satisfactory outcome of these tests small pieces are cut
off and prisms are prepared from them, whose refractive indices are
determined by means of the spectrometer. Upon these measurements
are based the accurate computation of the objective—that is to say,
the determination of the four radu of curvature and the thickness—
a tedious piece of work which requires repeated independent checking.

After this begins the real preparation ot the objective lenses, one
of which is to be ground concave, the other convex, on the same ma-
chine which was used in the rough grinding. This present procedure
is similar to that already described, except that grinding tools oppo-
site in curvature to the lenses and made of iron, brass, or glass are
fed with finer and finer emery powder as the work approaches its
finish.

Since everything depends on the proper guiding of the grinding
tool to obtain the regular spherical surfaces, the operating of the
machine demands great experience and care, and the work requires
frequent testing by the application of the spherometer. When finally
the right curvature is reached, after many days of work, repeated and
accurate testing of the lens is made by the Toppler “ Schlieren-
methode ” for small errors, nonhomogeneity, and other faults.

The fine-ground lens is now put upon a lathe and centered by means
of a fine adjusting crane. This centering consists of shifting the

168 CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPE LENSES.

lens about upon the spindle of the lathe until exact coincidence is
reached between the optic axis (common axis of curvature of the two
surfaces) and the mechanical axis of the spindle. Recognition of
this condition depends on observing the reflections from the’ two
glass surfaces, and accurate centering is reached when these reflec-
tions do not move with the rotation of the spindle. When the right
adjustment is made the edge of the disk is turned off true by means of
a grinding band fed with emery and water, and by this means the
lens is reduced to the proper diameter.

After the centering follows the fine polishing on a special polishing
machine. The process is much the same as that of rough polishing,
excepting that instead of a cloth-covered tool there is provided for
each face a series of great pitch-covered plates. Frequent trials of
the surfaces are made by means of so-called “ test glasses.” These are
small glass plates ground and polished accurately to fit the desired
curve; that is to say, convex for a concave surface, and vice versa.
Their employment in testing depends on the following principle:
If two closely fitting polished surfaces are laid one upon the other
there is retained between them a thin film of air which exhibits the
so-called ‘“* Newton’s colors,” seen in soap bubbles and similar thin
transparent structures. The color is the same over the whole surface
only when the thickness of the inclosed film is everywhere uniform,
which only occurs when the lens has the same curvature as the test
glass. At the beginning of the polishing the Newton’s colors appear
as rings of more or less width. By the proper use of polishing tools
of different sizes, and by suitable regulation of the stroke and velocity
of the machine, the condition is finally reached when a uniform
color supersedes the rings, no matter where the test glass is laid upon
the lens. By stich methods of measurement in terms of the wave length
of light, deviations of thickness of only one ten-thousandth millimeter
(one two-hundred-and-fifty-thousandth inch) can be accurately de-
tected, a magnitude scarcely appreciable to the lay mind. It is
obvious that the fine polishing in such conditions is an exceptionally
difficult task, the more so that care must always be exercised to avoid
all blemishes on the surfaces, such as scratches and the like, and only
the most competent and experienced workers can succeed with it.
A conception of the difficulties to be overcome may be found when it
is said that the fine polishing of a single lens surface takes several
months.

When both lenses have passed through the processes of fine grind-
ing and polishing they are inserted in brass or iron mountings which
have meanwhile been prepared for them and in which they he sepa-
rated by a small free space. Cementing together with Canada balsam
or turpentine, as generally practiced with small lenses, and formerly
with large ones also, has more recently been discontinued on account
CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPE LENSES. 169

of the difficulty of separating large cemented lenses for subsequent
cleaning. . .

After the lenses have been placed in their cell there remains only
the final testing in the telescope tube itself. I shall not describe the
complicated centering apparatus employed in this test. The errors
of an objective and their causes are numerous, and their discovery and
correction demand great experience and skill.

In conclusion, we may inquire where the telescopes of largest objec-
tives are located, and by whom they were made. In the first place,
there is the objective made for the Paris Exposition of 1900, but not
among the telescopes in present use. It is 1.24 meters in diameter,
and the glass alone weighs 580 ldlograms, of which the convex lens
weighs 360 and the concave lens 220 kilograms. The cost of the two
lenses was 75,000 francs. These disks were poured by Mantois and
ground by Martins, both of Paris. Up to the present time the objec-
tive has not been usefully employed. The second and third places,
as regards size alone, are taken by the objectives of the Yerkes
Observatory, near Chicago (1897), and that of the Lick Observatory,
at Mount Hamilton, Cal., with diameters, respectively, of 105 and
91 centimeters. Both were poured at the Paris glass works and fig-
ured by Alvan Clark in Cambridgeport, Mass.

They are both satisfactory, though not prepared entirely on the
basis of computation, but rather by repeated trials, and brought to
their completion by the so-called method of local correction. After
them in size comes the great refractor of the Potsdam Observatory,
prepared solely for celestial photography and having a diameter of
80 centimeters. This objective was poured in Jena and figured at
the optical works of C. A. Steinheil Séhne, in Munich, in 1899. ¥t is
recognized to be of the highest order of merit and is a strong testi-
mony to the ability of German manufacturers in this line. The Pots-
dam refractor has, in addition to the 80-centimeter photographic lens,
a second visual lens of 50 centimeters diameter, and being thus a
double refractor is perhaps the largest astronomical instrument in
use in the world. Both of the great American telescopes are devised
solely for visual purposes, and can only be used for photography by
the aid of auxiliary lenses which cut off some of the light.

Among other large objectives may be enumerated the Pulkova
refractor, at St. Petersburg, by Clark, diameter 76 centimeters; objec-
tive of the Observatory of Nice, of equal diameter, by Henry Brothers,
of Paris; the objective of the Vienna Observatory, of 71 centimeters
aperture, by Martins, and the Treptower objective, of 70 centimeters

aperture, poured at Jena, ground in Munich (1896), and costing
55,000 marks.

The objective of the Dorpat refractor, with 25 centimeters aperture,
which, as it came from the master hand of Fraunhofer, was regarded
as a wonder of the world, can scarcely be counted among the large
telescopes to-day, for already more than 100 exceed its dimensions.
Tt would lead too far to mention them all, but it is not out of place
to remark that there is work of great value also for the smaller
lenses. Interesting studies of the features of the planets have been
made even in recent times with smaller instruments. Thus Schiapa-
relli, the famous discoverer of the so-called Martian canals, made his
earher valuable observations with an 8-inch telescope, which would
now be classed as a minor instrument. In planetary observation the
advantages of fine optical definition, together with good atmospheric
conditions, combined with practiced eyes, are of more consequence than
high power or great light-gathering capacity. The advantages of
the largest instruments lie in the possibilities they afford of observing
the fainter fixed stars and nebule which le at immeasurable distances.
SOME REFLECTIONS SUGGESTED BY THE APPLICA-
TION OF PHOTOGRAPHY TO ASTRONOMICAL R#E-
SEARCH.¢

By H. H. Turner, D. Se., F. R. S.

It is a familiar fact that there are epochs in the history of a
science when it acquires new vigor; when néw branches are put forth
and old branches bud afresh or blossom more plenteously. The vivi-
fying cause is generally to be found either in the majestic form of the
discovery of a new law of nature or in the humbler guise of the
invention of a new instrument of research. The history of astron-
omy has been rich in such epochs, notable among them being that
when Newton announced to the world the great law of gravitation,
and that when Galileo first turned his telescope to the skies.

We have within the last half century been fortunate enough to
include another great epoch in astronomical history, characterized
by the birth, almost a twin birth, of two new scientific weapons—the
spectroscope and the sensitive film. It is, of course, somewhat diffi-
cult and searcely necessary to assign an exact date for the origin of
either of these. The spectroscope was perhaps first systematically
used on the heavenly bodies by Huggins, Rutherfurd, and Secchi in
the fifties, but we may trace it back to the early work of Fraunhofer,
who described the spectrum of Sirius in 1817, or further back to the
experiments of Newton with a prism; and the dry plate, which in
particular has conferred such benefits on our science, had of course
its precursors in the collodion plate or the daguerreotype. But the
greater part of the influence on astronomy of both the spectroscope
and the photographic method dates from the time when the dry plate
was first used successfully, not much more than a quarter of a cen-
tury ago; and in that quarter of a century there have been compressed
new advances in our knowledge which perhaps will compare favor-

ably with the work of any similar period in centuries either past or
to come. It is difficult to estimate at their true value historical events
in which we play a part, and any review of such a period undertaken
now must be necessarily imperfect, for we are advancing so rapidly
that our point of view is continually changing. But it is an encour-
aging thought that obvious difficulties may enhance interest in the
attempt and suggest kindly excuses for its shortcomings.

From the embarrassingly large number of possible topics which the
period provides I have selected that of astronomical photography,
and I invite your attention to some characteristic features of the
photographic method in astronomy, and some reflections thereupon.
It is scarcely possible to avoid repeating much that has been said
already, but I hope it will be clear that no claim to originality is
advanced. In what follows I wish to claim nothing as mine save
its imperfections.

The advantages of the photographic method, which attracted atten-
tion from the first, may be grouped under three heads—its power, its
facility, and its accuracy. The nes of demarcation are ill defined,
but the classification will help us a little, and I proceed to consider
the groups in this order.

The immense power of the photographic method as compared
with the eve arises from the two facts that (a@) by the accumulation
of long exposures fainter and fainter objects can be detected, and
that (>) large regions of the heavens can be recorded at the same
exposure. No property of the photographic plate has excited more
marvel than the former—that it can detect. objects too faint to be
seen even by our largest telescopes; objects of whose very existence
we were In ignorance and should have remained in ignorance. Early
successes have been followed up by others more striking as years
have rolled on, as better instruments have been devised, and the
patience of the watchers has proved equal to greater strain. It is
here that the change from the “ wet ” plate to the “ dry ” has proved
most advantageous. The possibilities with the former were limited
to the period during which it would remain wet; with the latter,
exposures may be continued for hours, days, even years—not, of
course, continuously in the case of astronomical photography, for
the camera must be closed when daylight approaches; but it can
be opened again at nightfall and the exposure resumed without
fault. In this way objects of extraordinary faintness have been
revealed to us. When Nova Persei had flashed into brilliance in
1901, and then slowly faded, long-exposure photographs of its region
revealed to us a faint nebulous structure which we could never
have seen; they told us that this structure was changing in appear-
ance in a manner which it taxed our ingenuity to explain, and about
which speculation is still rife. But a greater triumph was to come;
PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH. 1738

even the spectrum of this faint object has been photographed. When
we consider that in the spectrum each point of light in the object is
enormously diluted by being spread out into a line, the difficulty of
this undertaking seemed almost prohibitive; but it was not sufficient
to prevent Mr. Perrine, of the Lick Observatory, from making the
attempt, and he was deservedly rewarded by success. IT may be
wrong in regarding this success as the high-water mark in this diree-
tion at the present time, and it will probably be surpassed by some
new achievement very shortly; but it will serve to illustrate the
power of photography in dealing with faint objects.

But may we here pause for one moment to marvel at the sensi-
tiveness of the human eye, which is such that it is, after all, not
left very far behind in the race? The eye, sensitive as it is merely
to transient impressions, is no match ultimately for the plate, which
ean act by accumulation. But with similar instruments the plate
must be exposed for minutes or even hours to seize the impression
of a faint object which the eye can detect at a glance. There seems
to be no reason in the nature of things why the eye should not have
been surpassed in a few seconds; and in the future the sensitiveness
of plates may be increased so that this will actually be the case, even
as in the past there was a time when the sensitiveness was so small
that the longest exposure could not compete with the eye. But this
time is not yet come, and at the present moment the eye is still in
some departments superior to its rival, owing to this very fact,
that though it can only see by glances, it can use these glances to good
effect. In the study of the planets the more clumsy method of the
photographic plate (which, by requiring time for the formation of
the image, confuses good moments with bad) renders it almost use-
less as compared with the eye; and again, we have not as yet used
photography for daylight observations of stars.

But there is another direction in which the photographic plate is
immensely superior to the eye in power; it cain record so much more
at once.” In the able hands of Professor Barnard, Dr. Max Wolf,

@This property has been beautifully illustrated by a lecture experiment of
Professor Barnard. He throws on the screen a picture of a large nebula
which the photographic plate has no difficulty in portraying all at once; but
the picture is, in the first instance, covered up by a screen, except for a small
mperture only, and this aperture, he tells his audience, represents all that can
be seen by the eye at one time, using the giant telescope of the Yerkes Observa-
tory sy moving the screen about, different portions of the picture may be
viewed successively, as also by moving the telescope about in looking at the sky
itself. But what a revelation follows when the screen is removed and the full
glory of the nebula is exhibited at a single glance! We can well understand
that the true character of these objects was hopelessly misinterpreted by the
eye using the imperfect method of piecemeal observation, which alone was
formerly possible.
174 PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH.

and others, this property of the plate has been used to record the
presence in the sky of vast regions of nebulosity such as, we may
safely say, the eye would never have satisfactorily portrayed, not
altogether because of their faintness (for in one of his papers Pro-
fessor Barnard tells us that he was actually led to photograph such
a region because he had become vaguely conscious of it by eye obser-
vation), but because of their diffusion. It 1s noteworthy that these
beautiful photographs were taken with comparatively humble in-
struments, and we may be as yet only on the threshold of revelations
still to be made in this direction.

Secondly, the photographic method represents a great advance in
facility of manipulation. A familar example may be taken from
the domain of planetary discovery. In old time to recognize a new
object among numerous fixed stars it was necessary either labori-
ously to map out the whole region, or to learn it by heart, so that it
was practically mapped in the brain. Now all this labor is avoided ;
two photographs of the same region, taken without any strain on the
memory or the measuring ability of the observer, can at a glance, by
a simple comparison, give the information that a strange object is
or is not present—information formerly obtained at so much cost.
Sometimes, indeed, the cost was so great that the information was
not obtained at all. For fifteen years Hencke searched without sue-
cess for a planet, and for nearly forty years after the discovery of
the first four small planets, in 1807, no further discoveries were
made, though hundreds were constantly crossing the sky, and a
dozen new planets are now found every year with little trouble.

But though this instance of increase in facility is striking, it is far
from being the only one or even the most important. Wherever we
require a record of any kind, whether it be of the configuration of
stars, or of solar spots, or of the surface of the moon, or of a spec-
trum, the labor of obtaining it has been enormously reduced by the
photographic method. Think for a moment of what this means in
the last instance only—think of the labor involved in mapping one
single spectrum by eye observation; of the difficulty of settling by
such a method any doubtful question of the identity of certain lines
in the spectrum of a star. A few years ago Doctor McClean an-
nounced that he had found oxygen in the star # Crucis. Up to
that time this element, so familiar to us on this earth, had appeared
to belong to us alone in the universe, for in no spectrum had its lines
been detected. The proof of its existence in # Crucis depended on
the identity of a number of lines in the spectrum with some of those
of oxygen; and the measures were sufficiently difficult on a photo-
eraph, so that for more than a year the scientific world refused to
pronounce a verdict. How long would the case have dragged on if
only visual measures had been possible? We may fairly doubt
PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH. nba

whether a definite conclusion would ever have been reached at. all.
By the sheer facility.of the new method of work we have advanced
by leaps and bounds.where we could only crawl before.

Thirdly, there has been a great gain in accuracy from the intro-
duction of photography; and it is this quality which is above all of
value in the science of astronomy.” The wonderful exactness of the
photographic record may perhaps best be characterized by saying
that it has revealed the deficiencies of all our other astronomical
apparatus—object glasses and prisms, clocks, even the observer him-
self,

It has almost been forgotten that in the early days the accuracy
of a photograph was doubted. Even now it can scarcely be said
that we know definitely the stage of refinement at which we must
begin to expect irregular displacements of the images from distor-
tion of the photographic film; but we have learned that they do
not occur in a gross degree, and that other apparatus must be un-
proved before we need turn our attention seriously to errors aris-
mg from such a cause. Consider, for instance, what photography
has told us about our optical apparatus, which we regard as having
reached a high state of perfection. We are accustomed to think of
properly made optical apparatus as being sufficiently similar in all its
parts; it is tacitly assumed in the principle of the heliometer, for
example, that one half of the object glass is sufficiently similar to
the other. But a stock adjustment recently adopted in photograph-
ing a spectrum for accurate measurement exhibits clearly the errors
of this assumption. Photographs are taken of the spectrum through
the two halves of the objective; and if they were properly similar
the lines in the two halves of the spectrum should fit exactly. A
mere glance is usually sufficient to show discordances. It is true that
one of the photographs is taken through the thick half of the prism
and the other through the thin, so that errors of the prism are in-
cluded; but these, again, are optical errors. They are, however,
not the only sources of error which at present mask photographic
imperfections. Glass plates are not flat, and this want of flatness
introduces sensible errors. Even with the great improvements in
our driving clocks which were called for immediately photographs
were to be taken—with electrical control and careful watching on
driving error ”

be

the part of the observer—there is apt to creep ina
which gives bright stars a spurious displacement relatively too faint.
We must get flatter plates, better driving clocks, and watch more
4Two things may be measured on a photographic plate-——the position of an
object, or the density of the image; the former being an indication of its posi-
tion in the heavens, and the latter of its brightness. With the latter topic I
do not propose to deal, for the reason that it is in the hands of a much abler
and more experienced exponent; but the former alone will provide enough food

for reflection,

176 PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH.

carefully before we can certainly accuse our photographs of a failure
in accuracy. Nevertheless, there are indications that we may be
near the limit of accuracy even now. Examination of the réseau
lines on various plates appears to show small displacements for
which no cause has yet been assigned; and the end of our tether
may not be far away. But as yet we have not been pulled up short,
and there is hope that the warning may be, as on one or two previous
occasions, a false alarm.

Such being the accuracy of the photographic method, it is sur-
prising that it should not as yet have been more fully adopted in
that field of work where accuracy is of the greatest importance—
namely, in what is called fundamental work, with the transit
circle or other meridian instruments. The adoption of new methods
is always a slow process, and there are at least two classes of diff-
-culties which hinder it. The first class has it origin in the in-
stinctive conservatism of human nature, wherein men of science
differ little from their fellows. The second has to do with available
vapital; and in this respect we are distinctly at a disadvantage
compared with other men; for when a new instrument of general
utility is invented at once a large amount of capital is invested in
working out the details and improving them to the utmost, whereas
for a scientific instrument no such funds are available. Think,
for instance, of the money spent in perfecting the bicycle, and the
time occupied in developing it from the earliest forms to those
with which we are now familar—from the “ bone shaker” of the
sixties through the high bicycle which we saw twenty years ago
to the modern machine. Think, too, how totally unexpected have
been some of the incidents in the history of this machine, such as
the introduction of pneumatic tires. In the case of such an instru-
ment, now universally adopted, if rapid development could have
been secured by expenditure of money and brains, surely enough
of both commodities were forthcoming to attain that end; and yet
simplicity and finality have probably not yet been attained in a
period of thirty years. When we compare the small amount of
money and especially the small number of persons that can be de-
voted to the perfection of a new scientific method, such as the use of
photography in astronomy, it will excite little surprise that progress
during the same period of thirty years has been slower. In com-
merce old machines can be thrown on the scrap heap when improve-,
ments suggest themselves; but who can afford to throw away an old
transit circle? The very fact that it has been in use for many years
renders its continued use in each succeeding year the more important
from considerations of continuity.

It is doubtless for such reasons as these that little has yet been done
in the way of utilizing photography for meridian observation,

Although one or two meritorious beginnings have been made, which
have sufliced to show that there are no insuperable difficulties in the
way. up to the present moment no meridian instrument of repute
is in regular work using the photographic method. And this fact
can not, after all, be completely explained by the reasons above men-
tioned. Opportunities for setting up costly new instruments do not
oceur frequently in astronomy, but they do occur. In the last decade,
for instance, large transit circles have been sét up both at Greenwich
and the Cape of Good Hope; but in neither instance bas any attempt
been made to adopt the photographic method. The Washington
Observatory was reconstructed well within the period since the great
advantages of photography have been recognized, and yet not even
in the United States, the land of enterprise, was a start then made in
a direction in which it is certain that we must some day travel. That
day has probably been deferred by the stimulation of competing
methods which a new one brings with it. When electric hght was
first introduced into England the gas companies, stimulated by the
stress of competition, adopted a new and improved form of light (the
incandescent gas) which put them ata much less serious disadvantage
compared with their new rival. So when photography began to show
what new accuracy was attainable in measurement of star positions,
it would almost seem as if the devotees of the older visual methods
were compelled to improve their apparatus in order not to be left
wholly behind in the race. The registering micrometer ® was

«We have been accustomed hitherto to determine the position of a star by
observing the instant when it crossed a fixed wire; but it has long been known
that two different observers record systematically different instants—they have
a personal equation. Recently we have learned that this personal equation
varies with the brightness of the star observed, and with other circumstances,
and to make the proper corrections for it has severely taxed our ingenuity and
involved much work. Before the invention of photography we might well bear
this with patience, since it seemed to be inevitable; but the photographic plate
which is free from human errors, offers a way of escape from all troubles, at
the expense, no doubt, of some little experimenting, but with every prospect of
speedy success. Eye observation, which had borne this burden so long, must
get rid of it if it was to march alongside the untramimeled photographic
method; and the surprising thing is that it has actually done so. The.adopted
device is extremely simple: Replace the fixed wire which the star crosses by a
wire which moves with the star and registers its own movements. The register-
ing is done automatically, but the motion of the wire is controlled by the
observer, and there is still room for a new form of personal equation in this
human control. But none manifests itself, probably for the reason that we no
longer have two senses concerned, but only one. In recording the instant when
a star crosses a wire we employ either the eye and the ear, or the eye and the
sense of touch, and personal equation arises from the different coordination of
the two senses in different people. But in making the wire follow the star the
eye alone is concerned, and there is po longer any room for difference in “ latent
period ” or other coordination of two senses.

produced by Messrs. Repsold, with the astonishing result that the
troubles from personal equation, which have so long been a difficulty
in all fundamental work, have practically disappeared.

This beautiful invention has placed the eye once more in a position
actually superior to the photographic plate, for with the eye we can
observe stars in daylight, and so secure information of great impor-
tance, whereas no photographic method of doing this has as yet been
devised. And there is also the fact that.for faint stars a long
exposure would be required for what the eye can accomplish in a few
seconds.

Thus in one or two astronomic channels the effects of the rising
tide of photography have scarcely yet been felt; but into all the others
it has swept with ever-growing force. Looking back over the thirty
vears of advance, we may be well satisfied. With more funds, and
especially with more men, no doubt more could have been done; let
us even admit that we might have done better with the same funds
and the same limited staff. But on the whole we have been fortunate.
At a critical time, when we might have felt the want of larger endow-
ments acutely, the need was almost anticipated by a stream of bene-
faction. If this stream had its chief source in the United States, its
beneficial effeets have poured over the whole world, and induced cur-
rents have begun to flow elsewhere. We may reflect with thankful-
ness how much harder our advance might have been but for the noble
gifts to the Harvard, the Lick, and the Yerkes observatories, and
sarnestly hope that the cheerful expectations of a great American
astronomer, that these are but the foreshadowing of much larger gifts
to science, may be adequately realized.

May I now turn to one or two of the problems with which this new
development of our work has brought us face to face? They are
numerous and serious, and it is impossible to consider many of them,
perhaps even the most important of them. One of the most pressing
is the problem of rendering generally accessible the vast accumula-
tions of material for study that have been suddenly thrust upon our
attention. How are our photographs to be stored, preserved, and
published? Even now troubles have gathered, and time will only
multiply them. It is many years since Professor Pickering drew
attention to the difficuities in storing the photographic plates taken
at the Harvard Observatory. When many thousands of photographs
have been accumulated, not only the space they occupy, but the actual
weight of glass isan embarrassment. And there seems to be no doubt
concerning the duty of accumulation. May I confess an early and
mistaken view which I formulated on this matter? I reasoned thus:
The proper moment for making use of a photograph taken last night
is to-day. It is useless to defer the examination until to-morrow, for
there will then be new photographs claiming attention. Hence it is
PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH. 179

unscientific to take more photographs than can be dealt with imme-
diately. ‘This seemed to be a plausible argument and to show a way
out of the difficulty, for if a photograph had once been adequately
examined it need not be stored so carefully, and there would not in
any case be many to store. But Professor Pickering has demon-
strated many times over that the view is untenable. By taking photo-
graphs almost recklessly and without any hope of dealing with even
a fraction of them, he has created the possibility of tracing the his-
tory of celestial events backward. When new objects are discovered
he can go to his shelves and tell us how long they were visible previous
to discovery; and this information is so valuable that we must cer-
tainly arrange our future plans with reference to it. It 1s quite cer-
tain that we must be prepared to deal with enormous accumulations
of plates, to store them in proper order, and to catalogue them; and
if it has already been found difficult to do this for the collection of a
single observatory during twenty years, what can we look for in the
centuries to come 4

Possibly the second difficulty, that of preservation, may be an anti-
dote to the first. It is by no means certain that our photographs
will last long, and if not there will be a natural limit to the time
during which they need be kept. Sir William Crookes has, however,
reminded us that by toning them, by substituting sturdy gold for the
perishable silver, we may prolong their life indefinitely, though this
will, of course, sensibly increase the cost of each plate. As vet I have
not heard of any toning process being systematically adopted. Our
course is, however, comparatively clear in this direction. It would
seem imperative that a selection of the earhest photographs, at any
‘ate, should be carefully toned, so that they may be available for
comparison in years as far distant as possible. Although this is a
matter of detail, it seems to me to compare in Importance with almost
any practical question which may claim the attention of astronomers,
and if some decision of the kind were the only outcome of this gath-
ering I think we might be well content with the result.

The question of publication is chiefly one of funds, and is only
worthy of special remark because these particular funds are so often
forgotten im planning enterprises. I need not labor the point, for
the experience of any astronomer will supply him with plenty of
mstances. The difficulties of publication have much in common with
those of storage. They will increase year by year, and even when the
money for printing has been found the storage of publications re-
ceived from other observatories will itself become an embarrassment.
There is, however, one way in which some of the stress may be
relieved, namely, by efficient cataloguing. If we have before us a list
of all the photographs existing in the world, and know that we can
send for a copy of any one of them which may be required, it is no

.
180 PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH.

longer necessary to have copies of all. This apphes, of course, to
other publications as well, and though we may take some time to
grow out of the sentimental desire for a complete library, and though
the existence of a few such complete institutions may always be
desirable, I venture to think that many observatories will ultimately
be driven to the plan of acquiring only what is certainly and imme-
diately useful, depending on temporary loans from central institu-
tions for other material.

But there is a class of problems differing totally in character from
these practical questions of storage and preservation of plates. A
period of suddenly increased activity such as we have been passing
through in astronomy is not without important effects on astronomers
themselves. The human element in our scientific work is sometimes
overlooked and generally accorded only a subordinate importance ;
but, coming as I do from an old university devoted to the humanities,
I may be perhaps forgiven for calling attention to a few human con-
siderations. In the first piace, I have felt some anxiety lately for
that very important body of astronomers who are sometimes called
“amateurs,” though the name is open to criticism—those whose
opportunities for work are restricted to a more or less limited leisure.
it is a body which is somewhat sensitive to the feeling that astronom-
ical work has gone beyond them; that in the presence of large instru-
ments and of the special knowledge acquired by those using them
their own efforts and their own humbler instruments are no longer of
any value. If I am right in supposing that this feeling has been
called into existence lately by the rapid advances made in photog-
raphy, it is certainly not for the first time. At previous epochs this
‘liffidence has found expression, and has, I am glad to say, been met
by careful contradiction; but it is necessary to repeat the expostula-
tion again and again, for the anxiety is apt to crop up with every new
development of astronomical activity.

The earlier days of photography were better ones than usual for
the amateur; indeed, the introduction of the photographic method
is largely due to the work of such men as Rutherfurd and Draper in
America, De la Rue and Common in England. But now that we have
passed beyond the stage when each new plate taken was a revelation ;
now that we are tolerably familar with, at any rate, the main types
of possible photographs which can be taken with modest apparatus;
more especially now that we have begun to discuss in elaborate detail
the measurement of star positions or of stellar spectra, the old shyness
is beginning to crop up again. But it is of the utmost importance
that this shyness should be zealously overcome. Perhaps, after all, it
is not sufficient to assert that there is still good work for amateurs to
do, nor even to mention a few instances of such work urgently re-
quired; perhaps it should be made easier for them to follow what is
PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH. 181

being done. Especially do we want more and better books, written
by the best men on each subject... The original memoir, though it may
be the proper form of publication for the workers themselves, does
not satisfy all requirements. There is much to be done in the way of
extension and collation before the work can be presented in a form
attractive to those who would gladly keep in touch with it if the
process could be made a little easier. Huxley was constantly urging
scientific men that it was not sufficient to attain results; they must
also express them in an intelligible and attractive form. Of course
it is not easy for the same man to do both. There are few who could
have determined, like Schiaparelli, that the period of rotation of the
planet Mercury was eighty-eight days instead of one, but there are
fewer still who, after making the discovery, could have given the
beautiful lecture which he gave before the King of Italy, developing
fully in attractive detail the consequences of the discovery; and yet it
is probably true that many more could make, at any rate, an attempt
in this direction if adequate opportunity and inducement were pro-
vided. Could not a part of the sums available for the endowment of
research be devoted to the endowment of text-books? It is, of course,
an inducement to write such a book that it is a good thing well done:
but in the case of a scientific worker this is scarcely sufficient, because
the same could be said of his continuing his particular work. If we
ask him to pause and render the treasures he has collected accessible
to others there must be some additional inducement. Publishers are
not able to offer pecuniary encouragement, because books of the type
I have in mind would not appeal to a very large public. But why
should they not be subsidized? I do not think it need be a very
costly business, if the money were placed in the hands of a central
body to issue invitations for books to be written. An invitation
would be in itself a compliment, and the actual pecuniary value of
the inducement would shrink in importance, just as the actual amount
of gold in a medal awarded by one of our leading scientific societies
is not very seriously regarded. It may be objected that to ask the
best men to write text-books is to set them to inferior work, and so to
delay true scientific progress; but are we sure that the real march of
science is being delayed? There are pauses in a journey which merely
waste time, but there are others without which the whole journey
may be delayed or prevented, as when a man should neglect to rest
and feed the horse which carries him.

But the development of photography has brought with it much
more than a recurrence of diffidence in some amateurs; it has fore-
shadowed a serious rearrangement of astronomical work generally—
a new division of labor and a new system of cooperation. To quote
one notable instance, a very small number of observatories could take
enough photographs to keep the whole world busy examining or meas-
182 PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH.

uring them, and we are already face to face with the question whether
this is a desirable arrangement. Let me give a concrete example of
this modern situation. In the winter of 1900-1901 the small planet
Eros offered a specially favorable opportunity for determining the
solar parallax, and some thousands of photographs were taken at a
number of observatories for the purpose. It is not yet very clear
how a definitive result will be obtained from the mass of material
accumulated, most of which is being dealt with in a very leisurely
manner; but a small portion of it has been discussed by Mr. A. R.
Hinks, of Cambridge, and one of the many important results obtained
by him ina recently published paper (Mon. Not. R. A. S., June, 1904)
is this: That the plates taken at the Lick Observatory are susceptible
of such accurate measurement, and so numerous, that a determination
of the solar parallax from them alone would have a weight nearly
equal to that from the whole mass of material. If the Lick plates can
be measured and reduced, it will not much matter if all the others are
destroyed. Whence we may deduce two conclusions: Firstly, that it
is eminently desirable that these beautiful pictures should be meas-
ured and reduced as soon as possible; secondly, that we must consider
future plans of campaign very carefully if we are to avoid waste of
work and discouragement of workers. It is tolerably easy to reach
the first precise conclusion. I wish it were easier to arrive at some-
thing more definite in regard to the second. It seems clear that we
may expect some readjustment of the relations between the better-
equipped observatories and those less fortunate, but it is not at all
clear what direction that readjustment should take. One possibility
is indicated by the instance before us. The discussion of the Lick
photographs was not conducted at the Lick Observatory, but at Cam-
bridge. The price paid for the fine climate of Mount Hamilton is
the accumulation of work beyond the powers of the staff to deal with,
and the new division of labor may be for the observatories with fine
climates and equipment to take the photographs and astronomers
elsewhere to measure and discuss them. Professor Kapteyn has set
us a noble and well-known example in this direction, and in view
of the pressing need for a study of many photographs already taken,
it is to be hoped that his example will be followed, especially in cases
similar to his own, where no observatory is in existence. If in such
cases the investigator will set up a measuring machine instead of a
telescope, he will deserve the gratitude of the astronomical world.
But the case is not so clear when a telescope is already in exist-
ence. Mr. Hinks had a fine telescope at Cambridge, and it required
some self-denial on his part to give up observing for a time in order
to discuss the Lick photographs and others. If the accumulations
already made, and others certain to be made in the future, are to be
dealt with, this kind of self-denial must certainly be exercised,
PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH. 183

but it does not seem quite clear that it should always fall to the lot
of those with a modest equipment. Considerations of strict econ-
omy might suggest this view, but there is a human side to the
argument which is not unimportant. The danger that the minor
observatories should feel their work unnecessary is even graver than
the similar possibility in the case of amateurs already mentioned,
and calls for prompt attention from astronomers generally if it
is to be averted. It is the more serious because of another set of
considerations of a quite different kind, viz, the funds available for
research show a rather alarming tendency to accumulate in the
hands of a few large observatories, leaving many astronomers who
could do useful work without the means of doing it. A conspicu-
ous example is afforded by the present state of the work for the
astrographic chart initiated in Paris seventeen years ago. On the
one hand, a few of the large observatories have easily acquired funds
not only for taking and measuring the plates and printing the
results, but for pubhshing an expensive set of charts which will
be of very little use to anyone; on the other hand, some of their
colleagues have found the utmost difficulty im getting funds for
even taking the plates; others have got so far, but can not proceed
to measure them; and very few, indeed, have yet funds for printing.
If there had been a true spirit of cooperation for the general good
in this enterprise, surely some of the funds being squandered on
the comparatively useless charts would have been devoted to the
proper completion of the only part of the scheme which has a chance
of fulfillment. I do not mean to imply that this would have been
an easy matter to arrange, but it is noteworthy that no attempt
in this direction has been made, and that as a consequence a prom-
ising scheme is doomed to failure in one important particular.
For though the survey of the whole sky to the eleventh magnitude
may some day be completed, it will be sadly lacking in homogeneity.
Some sections are finished before others are begun, so that in the
vital matter of epoch we shall have a scrappy and straggling series
instead of a compact whole.

Cooperation in scientific work, the necessity of which is being
borne in upon us from all sides, is nevertheless beset with difficul-
ties, and no doubt we shall only reach success through a series of
failures, but we shall reach it the more rapidly if we note carefully
the weaknesses of successive attempts. In the particular scheme of
the astrographic chart, I think an error which should be avoided in
future was made by those who have access to the chief sources of
astronomical endowment. They have made the enterprise doubly
difficult for their colleagues, firstly, by setting a standard of work
which was unattainable with limited resources, and, secondly, by
depleting the reserves which might have gone to assist the weaker
observatories. .
184 PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMICAL RESEARCH.

It is easier to draw attention to these modern tendencies than to
suggest a remedy for them. It may, perhaps, be questioned whether |
a remedy is either possible or necessary; it may be urged that it is
both inevitable and desirable that astronomical observation should
gravitate more and more to those well-equipped observatories where
it can be best conducted, and that new resources will obtain the
greatest results when added to a working capital which is already
large. From the purely economical point of view of getting results
most rapidly, these conclusions may be true. But if we look at the
human side of the question, I hope we shall dissent from them; if we
think first of astronomers rather than of the accumulation of astro-
nomical facts I hope we shall admit that something must be done to
check the excessive specialization and the inequalities of opportunity,
toward which there is a danger of our drifting. We can not afford
the division of astronomers into two types; one isolated in a well-
equipped observatory in a fine but rather inaccessible climate, spend-
ing his whole time in observing or taking photographs; another
in the midst of civilization, enjoying all the advantages of_inter-
course with other scientific men, but with no telescope worth using,
and dependent for his material on the observations made by others.
Some division of labor in this way is doubtless advantageous, but
we must beware lest the division become too sharply pronounced.
Will it be possible to prevent its undue growth by some alternation
of duties? Can the hermit observer and the university professor
take turn and turn about to the common benefit? The proposal is,
perhaps, a little revolutionary, and has the obvious disadvantages
of inconvenience and expense at the epochs of change, but I do not
think it should be set aside on these grounds.

I must admit, however, that I am not ready with a panacea. It
has been chiefly my object to draw attention to some modern tenden-
cles In astronomical work, hoping that the remedies may be evolved
from a general consideration of them. Such questions of the rela-
tionship of the worker to his work are even harder to solve than those
we meet with in the work itself. But there is at least this excuse for
noticing them on an occasion like the present, that they are to some
extent common to all departments of knowledge, and our difficulties
may come to the notice of others who have had occasion to consider
them in other connections and may be able to help us. Or, again,
we may take the more flattering view that the human problems of
astronomy to-day may be those of some other science to-morrow,
for astronomy is one of the oldest of the sciences and has already
passed through many stages through which others must pass. In
any case, we must deal with these problems in the sight of all men,
and of all the consequences entailed by our lately acquired oppor-
tunities none are more interesting and none can be more important
to us than those affecting the astronomer himself.
RADIATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.*

By Prot. a oe Boy NTING Res:

I propose to discuss this afternoon certain effects of the energy
which is continuously pouring out from the sun on all sides with the
speed of light, the energy which we call sunlight when we enjoy the
brilliance of a cloudless sky, which we call heat when we bask in its
warmth, the stream of radiation which supports all life on our
globe and is the source of all our energy.

As we all know, this ceaseless stream of energy is a form of wave
motion. If we pass a beam of sunlight or its equivalent, the beam
from an electric are, through a prism, the disturbance is analyzed
into a spectrum of colors, each color of a different wave length, the
length of wave changing as we go down the spectrum from, say, one
thirty-thousandth of an inch in the red to one eighty-thousandth of
an inch in the blue or violet.

3ut this visible spectrum is merely the part of the stream of radia-
tion which affects the eve. Beyond the violet are the still shorter
waves which affect a photographic plate or a fluorescent screen, and
will pass through certain substances opaque to ordinary leht. Here,
for instance, is a filter devised by Professor Wood which stops visi-
ble rays, but allows the shorter invisible waves to pass and excite
the fluorescence of a platinocyanide screen.

Again, beyond the red end are still longer waves, which are present
in very considerable amount, and can be rendered evident by their
heating effect. We can easily filter out the visible rays and_ still
leave these long waves in the beam by passing it through a thin sheet
of vuleanite. A piece of phosphorus placed at the focus of these
invisible rays is at once fired, or a thermometer quickly rises in tem-
perature. The waves which have been observed and studied up to
the present time range over some nine octaves, from the long waves
described to the section yesterday by Professor Rubens, waves of

ciation, August 23, 1904. Reprinted from author’s corrected copy.

which there are only 400 in an inch, down to the short waves found
by Schumann in the radiation given off by hydrogen under the
influence of the electric discharge, waves of which there are a quarter
of a million in an inch. No doubt the range will be extended.

Radiant energy consists of a mixture of any or all of these wave
lengths, but the eye is only sensitive at the most to a little more than
one octave in the nine or more.

This radiation is emitted not only by incandescent bodies such as
the sun, the electric arc, or flames. All bodies are pouring out radiant
energy, however hot or cold they may be. In this room we see
things by the radiation which they reflect from the daylight. But,
besides this borrowed radiation, every surface in the room is send-
ing out radiation of its own. Energy is pouring forth from walls,
ceiling, floor, rushing about with the speed of ght, striking against
the opposite surfaces, and being reflected, scattered, and absorbed.
And though this radiation does not affect our eyes, it 1s of the utmost
importance in keeping us warm. Could it be stopped, we should
soon be driven out by the intense cold, or remain to be frozen to
death.

As the temperature of a body is raised, the stream of radiation it
pours out increases in quantity. But it also changes in quality.
Probably the surface always sends out waves of all lengths from
the longest to the shortest, but at first, when it is cold, the long waves
alone are appreciable. As it gets hotter, though all the waves become
more intense, the shorter ones increase most in intensity, and ulti-
mately they become so prominent that they affect our sense of sight,
and then we say that the body is red or white hot.

The quality of the stream depends on the nature of the surface,
some surfaces sending out more than others at the same temperature.
But the stream is the greatest from a surface which is, when cold,
quite black. - Its blackness means that it entirely absorbs whatever
radiation falls upon it, and such a surface when heated sends out
radiation of every kind, and for a given temperature each kind of
radiation 1s present to the full extent—that is, no surface sends out
more of a given wave length than a black surface at a given tempera-
ture.

A very simple experiment shows that a black surface is a better
radiator, or pours out more energy when hot, than a surface which
does not absorb fully, but reflects much of the radiation which falls
upon it. If a platinum foil with some black marks on it be heated
to redness, the marks, black when cold, are much brighter than the
surrounding metal when hot; they are, in fact, pouring out much
more visible radiation than the metal.

It is with these black surfaces that I am concerned to-day. But,
inasmuch as it seems absurd to call them black when they are white
RADIATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 187

hot, I prefer to call them full radiators, since they radiate more
fully than any others... °

For a long time past experiments have been made to seek a law
connecting the radiation or energy flow from a black or fully radiat-
ing surface with its temperature. But it was only twenty-five years
ago that a law was suggested by Stefan which agrees at all satisfac-
torily with experiment. This law is that the stream of energy is
proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, reckoned from
the absolute zero 273° below freezing point on the centigrade scale.
This suggestion of Stefan served as the starting point of new and
most fertile researches, both theoretical and practical, and we are
glad to welcome to this meeting Professors Wien, Lummer, and
Rubens, who have all done most brilliant work on the subject. :

Among the researches on radiation recently carried out is one by
Kurlbaum, in which he determined the actual amount of energy
issuing from the black or fully radiating surface per second at LO0°
C., and therefore at any temperature.

Here is a table which gives the amount at various temperatures,
as determined by Kurlbaum :

As an illustration of the * fourth power law,” let us see what value
it will give us for the temperature of the sun, assuming that he is a
full raciator, or that his surface, if cooled down, would be quite
black.

We can measure approximately the stream of energy which the
sun is pouring out by intercepting the beam falling on a surface
exposed to full sunlight, measuring the heat given to that surface
per second, and then calculating what fraction the beam is of the
whole stream issuing from the sun.

This was first done by Pouillet, and his method will serve to illus-
trate the principle of all other methods.

In his apparatus the sunlight fell full upon a box containing
water, and the rate at which the water rose in temperature gave the
energy in the'stream of solar radiation falling on the box.
188 RADIATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

Simple as the experiment appears, the determination is beset with
difficulties, the chief beimg the estimation of the fraction of the
energy intercepted by the atmosphere, and we are still unable to
give a very definite value. Indeed, we can not yet say whether the
outflow of energy is constant or whether it varies. In all probability,
however, it does vary, and Professor Langley, who has devoted years
of work to the subject, has recently obtained evidence indicating
quite considerable variation.

We may, however, assume that we are not very far from the true
value if we say that the stream of radiation from the sun falling
perpendicularly on 1 cm? outside the earth’s atmosphere will heat
1 em. of water one twenty-fourth of a degree centigrade every
second, or will give one twenty-fourth of a calory per second.

Now, the area of a sphere round the sun at the distance of the
earth is 46,000 times the area of the sun’s surface. The energy from
1 em? of the sun thus passes through 46,000 cm? at the surface of the
earth. It is therefore 46,000 multiplied by one twenty-fourth calories,
or 1,920 calory-seconds. But from the table already given a black sur-
face at 6,250° absolute, say 6,000° C., gives 1,930 calories per second,
or the temperature of the sun’s radiating surface is 6,000°, if he is a
full radiator—and there is good reason to suppose that no great error
is made in taking him to be one.

Let us now take another illustration of the fourth power law.

Imagine a little black body which is a good conductor of heat placed
in full sunlight at the distance of the earth. Let it be 1 em? in cross

section, so that it is receiving one twenty-fourth of a calory per
second.

It will soon warm up to such a temperature that it gives out just as
much as it receives, and since it is so small heat will rapidly flow
through it from side to side, so that it will all be very nearly at the
same temperature. A sphere 1 cm? in cross section has area 4+ ¢m?,
so that it must be giving out from each square centimeter of its
surface jy = 0.0104 calory each second. From the table above it will
be seen that this corresponds very nearly indeed to a temperature of
300° absolute or 27° C., say 80° F.

It is to be noted that this only apples to a little round body. A
flat plate facing the sun would be about 60° C. hotter, while if it were
edgewise to the sun it might be very much colder.

Let us now see what would be the temperature of the small black
sphere at other distances from the sun. It is easily seen that inas-
much as the heat received, and therefore that given out, varies
inversely as the square of the distance, the temperature, by the fourth
power law, will vary inversely as the square root of the distance.

Here is a table of temperatures of small black spheres due to solar
radiation :

We see from this table that the temperature at the earth’s distance
is remarkably near the average temperature of the earth’s surface,
which is usually estimated as about 16° C., or 60° I. This can hardly
be regarded as a mere coincidence. The surface of the earth receives,
we know, an amount of heat from the inside almost infinitesimal com-
pared with that which it receives from the sun, and on the sun, there-
fore, we depend for our temperature. The earth acquires such a tem-
perature, in fact, that it radiates out what it receives from the sun.
The earth is far too great for the distribution of heat by conduction
to play any serious part in equalizing the temperature of different
regions. But the rotation about its axis secures nearly wniform tem-
perature in a given latitude, and the movements of the atmosphere
tend to equalize temperatures in different latitudes. [ence we should
expect the earth to have, on the average, nearly the temperature of
the small black body at the same distance, slightly less because it
reflects some of the solar radiation, and we find that it is, in fact, some
10° C. less.

Professor Wien was the first to point out that the temperature of
the earth has nearly the value which we should expect from the
fourth power law.

Here is a table showing the average temperatures of the surfaces of
the first four planets on the supposition that they are earth-hke in all
their conditions:

The most interesting case is that of Mars. He has, we know, a day
nearly the same in length as ours. His axis is inclined to the ecliptic
only a little more than ours, and he has some kind of atmosphere. — It
is exceedingly difficult to suppose, then, that his average temperature
ean differ much from —38° C. His atmosphere may be less pro-
tective, so that his day temperature may be higher, but then, to com-
pensate, his night temperature will be lower. Even his highest equa-

190 RADIATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

torial temperature can not be much higher than the average. On
certain suppositions I find that it is still 20° below the freezing point,
and until some new conditions can be pointed out which enable him to
establish far higher temperatures than the earth would have at the
same distance it is hard to believe that he can have polar caps of
frozen water melting to liquid in his summer and filling rivers or
canals. Unless he is very different from the earth, his whole surface
is below the freezing point.

Let us now turn from these temperature effects of radiation to an-
other class of effects, those due to pressure.

More than thirty years ago Clerk Maxwell showed that on his elec-
tromagnetic theory of hight, hght and all radiation like light should
press against any surface on which it falls. There should also be a
pressure back against any surface from which radiation is reflected
or from which it is issuing as a source, the value in every case being
equal to the energy in a cubic centimeter of the stream. The exist-
ence of this pressure was fully demonstrated independently by Lebe-
dew and by Nichols and Hull some years ago in brilliant experiments
in which they allowed a beam of light to fall on a suspended disk in
a vacuum. The disk was repelled, and they measured the repulsion
and found it to be about that required by Maxwell's theory. Nichols
and Hull have since repeated the experiment with greater exactness,
and there is now no doubt that the pressure exists and that it has
Maxwell’s value.

The radiation, then, poured out by the sun is not only a stream of
energy, but it 1s also, as it were, a stream of pressure pressing out the
heavenly bodies on which it falls. Since the stream thins out as it
cliverges, according to the inverse square of the distance, the pressure
on a given surface falls off according to the same law. We know the
energy in a cubic centimeter of sunlight at the distance of the earth,
since, moving with the velocity of light, it will supply one twenty-
fourth of a calory per second. It is easy to calculate that it will
press with a force of 6 by 10 ° degree on a square centimeter, an
amount so small that on the whole earth it is but 75,000 tons, a mere
trifle compared with the 3,000,000 billion tons with which the sun
pulls the earth by his gravitation.

But now notice the remarkable effect of size on the relation between
the radiation pressure and the gravitative pull. One is on the sur-
face and proportional to the surface, while the other penetrates the
surface and pulls every grain of matter throughout the whole volume.

Suppose we could divide the earth up into eight equal globes. Each
would have half the diameter of the earth and a quarter the surface.
The eight would expose twice the surface which the earth exposes, and
the total radiation pressure would be doubled, while the total gravi-
tative pull would be the same as before. Now divide up each of the
RADIATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 191

eight into eight more equal globes. Again the radiation pressure
would be doubled, while gravitation would be the same.

Continue the process, and it is evident that by successive division
we should at last arrive at globes so small and with total surfaces
so great that the pressure of the radiation would balance the pull
of gravitation. Mere arithmetic shows that this balance would
occur when the earth was divided up into little spheres each one forty-
thousandth of a centimeter in diameter.

In other words, a little speck one forty-thousandth of a centi-
meter, say one one-hundred-thousandth of an inch in diameter, and of
density equal to that of the earth, would be neither attracted nor
repelled by the sun.

This balance would hold at all distances, since both would vary
in the same way with the distance. Our arithmetic comes to this,
that if the earth were spread out in a thin spherical shell with radius
about four times the distance of Neptune, the repulsion of sunlight
falling on it would balance the inward pull by the sun and it would
have no tendency to contract.

With further division repulsion would exceed attraction, and the
particles would be driven away. But T must here say that the law
of repulsion does not hold down to such fine division. The repulsion
is somewhat less than we have calculated, owing to the diffraction of
the light.

Some very suggestive speculations with regard to comets’ tails
have arisen from these considerations, and to these Professor Boys
directed the attention of section A last year. We may imagine that
the nucleus of a comet consists of small meteorites. When these
come near the sun they are heated and explosions occur, and fine
dust is produced not previously present. If the dust is sufficiently
fine, radiation may overpower gravitation and drive it away from the
sun, and we may have a manifestation of this expelled dust in the
tail of the comet.

I do not, however, want to dwell on this to-day, but to look at the
subject in another way.

Let us again introduce our small black sphere, and let us make
it 1 em.’ in cross section, 1.13 cm. in diameter, and of the density
of the earth. The gravitation pull on it is forty-two thousand times
the radiation pressure.

Now let us see the effect of size on the radiating body. Let us
halve the diameter of the sun. He would then have one-eighth
the mass and one-quarter the surface. Or, while his pull was re-
duced to one-eighth, his radiation push would only be reduced to
one-quarter. The pull would now be only twenty-one thousand
times the push. Halve the diameter again, and the pull would be
only ten thousand five hundred times the push. Reduce the diam-
192 RADIATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

eter to one forty-two-thousandth of its orignal value, that is, to
about 20 miles, and the pull would equal the push.

In other words, a sun as hot as ours and 20 miles in diameter would
repel bodies less than 1 cm. in diameter, and could only hold in these
which were larger.

3ut it is, of course, absurd to think of such a small sun as this hay-
ing so high a temperature as 6,000°. Let us then reduce the tempera-
ture to one-twentieth, say 306° absolute, or the temperature of the
earth. Then the radiation would be reduced to the fourth power of
one-twentieth, or one one-hundred-and-sixty-thousandth, and the
diameter would have to be reduced to one one-hundred-and-sixty-
thousandth of 20 miles, or about 20 cm., say 8 inches, when again
radiation would balance gravitation.

It is not very difficult to show that if we had two equal spheres each
of the density and temperature of the earth they would neither attract
nor repel each other—their radiation pressure would balance the
gravitative pull—when their diameters were about 2.26 em., when, 1n
fact, they were about the size of large marbles.

It must be remembered that this is only true for spheres out in
space receiving no appreciable radiation from the surrounding region.

It would appear that we have arrived at a result of some impor-
tance in considering the aggregation of small meteorites. Imagine a
thinly scattered stream of small meteorites at the distance of the earth
from the sun. Then, even if they be as large as marbles, they may
have no tendency to move together. If they are smaller they may
even tend to move apart and scatter.

In conclusion, let me mention one more effect of this radiation pres-
sure. You will remember that radiation presses back against any
surface from which it issues. If, then, a sphere at rest in space is
radiating equally on all sides it is pressed equally on all sides, and the
net result is a balance between the pressures. But suppose that it 1s
moving. It is following up the energy which it pours forth in front,
crowding it into a smaller space than if it were at rest, making jt
more dense. Hence the pressure is slightly greater, and it can be
shown that it is greater the greater the velocity and the higher the
temperature. On the other hand, it is drawing away from the energy
which it pours out behind, thinning it out, as it were, and the pressure
at the back is slightly less than if the sphere were at rest.

The net result is a foree opposing the motion, a force lke a viscous
friction, always tending to reduce the speed.

Thus calculation shows that there is a retarding force on the earth
as it moves along its orbit amounting in all to about 2,500 kgm. Not
very serious, for in billions of years it will only reduce the velocity
by one in a million, and it will only have serious effects if the life of
RADIATION IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 193

the earth is prolonged at its present temperature to hundreds of bil-

lions of years. ;

But here again size is everything. Reduce the diameter of the
moving body, and the retarding effect increases in proportion to the
reduction. If the earth were reduced to the size of a marble, the
effect would be appreciable in a hundred thousand years. If it were
reduced to a speck of dust a thousandth of a centimeter in diameter,
the effect would be appreciable in a hundred years.

Note what the effect would be. Imagine a dust particle shot out
from the earth and left behind to circulate on its own account round
the sun. It would be heated by the sun and would be radiating out
on all sides. As it journeyed forward there would be a resisting
force tending to stop it. But instead of acting in this way the resist-
ance would enable the sun to pull the particle inward, and the fall
inward would actually inerease the velocity. This increase in the
velocity would increase the resistance, and at the same time the
approach to the sun would raise its temperature, increase the racia-
tion, and so increase the resistance still further. The particle would
therefore move in a mere and more rapid orbit, and ultimately it
would fall into the sun. Small marble-sized meteorites would fall in
from the distance of the earth probably in a few million years.
Small particles of dust would be swept in in a few thousand years.

Thus the sun is ever at work keeping the space round him free
from dust. If the particles are very minute he drives them forth into
outer space. If they are larger he draws them in. It is just possible
that we have evidence of this drawing in in the zodiacal light, that
vast dust-like ring which stretches from the sun outwards far beyond
the orbit of the earth and is at once the largest and the most myste-
rious member of the solar system.

glass vessel

If we take the ordinary air of a room and inclose it ina
containing some water and provided with some means of increasing
or diminishing the volume at will, we are able to observe the follow-
ing phenomena: If the air has been allowed to stand sufficiently long
to become saturated with water vapor, any increase of volume, even
if very slight, causes the formation of a fog throughout the volume
of the moist air. This is easily made visible by concentrating a
powerful beam of light on the contents of the vessel; or, by placing
a small source of light behind the vessel, brilliant-colored rings or
coronas may be seen surrounding the source. If the air be made to
contract again to its original volume, a second expansion like the first
will again give a similar fog, but when this process has been several
times repeated the fogs become thinner, the drops being fewer and
larger; we get at length a fine rain on expansion rather than a fog,
the drops falling to the bottom of the vessel within a few seconds
instead of remaining in suspension for many minutes lke the first-
formed fog particles. When this stage has been reached, the next
and all succeeding expansions produce no drops at all, no condensation
resulting elsewhere than on the walls of the vessel. If ordinary air
be now admitted into the vessel, drops will again be seen on expan-
sion, unless the air introduced has entered through a tightly pressed
plug of cotton wool, or has been otherwise filtered, in which case no
drops are seen.

The phenomena are readily explained if we suppose that water can
not under ordinary circumstances condense in the form of drops
unless suitable nuclei are present to serve as starting points for the
drops. These nuclei are present in very varying numbers in ordinary
atmospheric air, from which they may be removed by filtering, or

by repeatedly forming a cloud by expansion, and allowing the dreps
to fall to the bottom of the vessel. Both the facts and the explans-
tion have been long known. The particles which serve as the nuclei
of the drops formed, when ordinary atmospheric air is allowed to
expand shghtly, are conveniently called “ dust ” particles; they are
generally too small to be themselves visible, and it would be difficult
to find a means of determining whether they consist of solid particles
or of minute drops of liquid. The number of these dust particles
per cubic centimeter of air in different localities and under different
weather conditions has been investigated by Aitken and by others
with the aid of the ingenious dust-counting apparatus invented by
him.

It is not difficult to understand why nuclei should be necessary for
the condensation of water in the form of drops. Lord Kelvin proved
that the pressure of aqueous vapor necessary for equilibrium over a
convex or concave surface of water differed from that over a flat
surface, being less over a concave and greater over a convex surface.
He shows how we may calculate the difference. A very small drop of
pure water will, if we assume the surface tension to remain the same
for very small drops as for large ones, evaporate even when sur-
rounded by vapor many times more dense than that in equilibrium
at the same temperature over a flat surface. Thus unless the initial
stages of the growth of the drops can be, as it were, omitted, owing
to the presence of not too minute nuclei, a high degree of supersatu-
ration may exist without any condensation in the form of rain cr
cloud resulting. Lord Kelvin showed that to alter the equilibrium
vapor pressure by one part in a thousand the radius of curvature of a
spherical drop must amount to about 10—* cm. Thus very minute
nuclei will enable a cloud to be formed with a very slight degree of
supersaturation; in other words, as a result of a very slight expansion
of the air if this has been initially saturated with water vapor.

Lord Kelvin refrained from extending his calculations to curva-
tures of greater amount, as the surface tension can not remain inde-
pendent of the radius much beyond that limit. It is- convenient,
however, to extend the calculations to greater curvatures; for
although the results obtained can not be considered as quantitatively
correct, they enable us to form a picture of the mode of action of
nuclei of different kinds. Let us imagine an arrangement equivalent
to that considered by Lord Kelvin; but since we are only here con-
cerned with convex surfaces, let the capillary tube be joined as a side
tube to the lower part of a tall vessel of water. The capillary must
be supposed to have walls of such a nature as not to be wetted by
water, and let us suppose the open end of it to be bent round, so that
it points vertically upward, and that the height of the vertical por-
tion can be adjusted to bring the meniscus to the open end of the tube.
CONDENSATION NUCLEI. 197

Let the whole apparatus be contained in a closed vessel containing
only water vapor. — ,

We have then the convex water-air meniscus:depressed below the
level of the flat surface in the large vessel to a depth “2, such that
gwh = 2T/r, where ¢ is the acceleration due to gravity, w the density
of the liquid (w= 1 in the present case), T is the surface tension, and
r the radius of curvature. Thus the pressure of the vapor in contact
with the meniscus must be greater than that over the flat surface by
that due to the weight of a column of water vapor of height /. the
pressure at the top of the column being that required for equilibrium
over a flat surface at the given temperature. This increased pressure
must, moreover, be the pressure necessary for equilibrium over the
curved surface; distillation from the one surface to the other would

otherwise take place, resulting in a continuous circulation. To find
this pressure p,, p, being that at the flat surface we have dp=gpdh,

We have thus the means of calculating the pressure, or the density,
which water vapor must have in order that it may be in equilibrium
in contact with a drop of any size. The equilibrium is obviously
unstable; a drop, if too big for equilibrium, will grow so long as the
supersaturated condition is maintained; if too smal! it will evaporate
completely. The possession of a charge of electricity by the drop or
the existence of a dissolved substance within it will cause the drop to
be stable if its size be less than a certain limit, depending on the mag-
nitude of the charge or the quantity of dissolved substance. Let us
consider the case of electrification. We may imagine the water sur-
face in one limb of a U tube in an arrangement like that described
above, to be uniformly charged with eleetricity by holding a very
short distance above it a parallel conducting surface maintained at a
different potential. It is immaterial whether the water surface be
flat or curved; a tension of 2 26? dynes per square centimeter will be

meter. This will raise the electrified surface above the level which it
198 CONDENSATION NUCLEI.

would have occupied in the absence of the charge through a distance
2 m0 */g, and there will be a corresponding diminution in the satura-
tion vapor pressure. The vapor pressure necessary for equilibrium
over a charged drop is now given by the equation

Pi Rt euie Rt se eae

where p, is the saturation vapor pressure over a flat, uncharged sur-
face, p, that necessary for equilibrium at the same temperature in
presence of the drops, and e¢ is the charge on each drop. In an at-
mosphere saturated with respect to a flat uncharged surface a drop
carrying a charge e would be in stable equilibrium if its radius were
such that the two terms on the right-hand side of the above equation
were equal, 1. e., when 7*==e?/16a T. If the density of the vapor were
increased the drop would become larger, the equilibrium remaining
stable until the vapor pressure reached the maximum value corre-
sponding to the above equation. To find this we have on differen-

tiating
hapa lS (fae a wale ee
pdr Rt Py) Tre
The maximum vapor pressure in contact with the drops occurs

when 7*—¢?/4 2 T, and has the value given by

log Bes 3T
, 2 Rir

If the pressure of the vapor be increased beyond this limit the
unstable condition is reached, and the drop increases in size so long as
the supply of vapor is unlimited. In most cases the final size of the
drops would be determined by the amount of vapor initially present,
and the number of drops among which the water is distributed ;
unless they are very numerous, and, therefore, very small when full
grown, they will grow until the vapor is not sensibly supersaturated ;
it will only be in very rare cases that the final size of the drops is so
small that equilibrium will be reached while the vapor is at all con-
siderably supersaturated. .

It is easily seen that the behavior of drops containing dissolved sub-
stances will be quite similar. If we start with very small drops, there
is for a given size of drops a certain vapor pressure corresponding to
equilibrium; if we increase the density of the vapor the drop grows,
the equilibrium remaining stable, until a certain size is reached, after
which the drops suddenly grow to their full size. The theory of con-
densation on ions or other nuclei has been treated by J. J. Thomson ¢
and by Langevin and Bloch.?

LIMITING SUPERSATURATION IN DUST-FREE GASES.

When air saturated With water vapor has been freed from dust
particles no drops are formed on expansion, provided that a certain
critical degree of supersaturation has not been exceeded. To pro-
duce the supersaturation necessary for condensation in the form of
drops in dust-free air the air must be allowed to expand suddenly,
ull the final volume is 1.25 times the initial volume. The condensa-
tion is rainlike in form, and the number of drops remains small
although the expansion considerably exceeds this lower limit. Ex-

pansions exceeding a second limit, 7,/7,=1.38 give foes, which increase
rapidly in density, 1. e., in the number of the drops as the expansion
is increased’ beyond this limit. In such experiments it is of course
necessary that the apparatus used should be such that a very rapid
change of volume can be brought about, and that the ratio of the final
to the initial volume is known with certainty. Some years ago I
introduced a method which has proved suitable for the purpose.
When this method is used it would appear from the consistency of the
results obtained with cloud chambers varying in capacity from 15 to
1,500 ce. that the expansion is adiabatic and is completed before any
appreciable quantity of water has had time to separate out. From
the ratio of the final to the initial volume, knowing the initial temper-
ature, we can deduce the temperature at the moment when the expan-
sion was completed from the equation for the cooling of a gas by
adiabatic expansion.

a= Vv; an

6, Vo

y may be taken as not differing sensibly from its value for the dry
gas. Knowing the final temperature we have the data from which we
ean obtain the density of the vapor which would be required for sat-
uration at the moment of completion of the expansion, and we know
the actual density at that moment from the initial temperature and
the ratio of the final to the initial volume. Thus the supersaturation
measured by the ratio of the actual density of the vapor at the instant
when the expansion is completed to the density of the saturated vapor
at the temperature which the supersaturated gas then possesses can
be calculated.

The supersaturation required for the rainlike condensation is found
in this way to be approximately fourfold, that required for the cloud-
like condensation being nearly eightfold. There are these two classes
of nuclei always present in ‘moist dust-free air, and always being pro-
duced, for however often the process of condensing water on the
nuclei and allowing the drops to settle is repeated the number of
drops formed in subsequent expansions is undiminished. The nuclei

.

which give rise to the rainlike condensation and which are at any
moment present in quite small numbers are, as we shall see, ions con-
tinually being produced in the gas. They can be removed by an elee-
tric field. The cloudlike condensation occurring with large expan-
sions is entirely unaffected by an electric field; it is independent also
of the nature of the gas. If we calculate how large a drop of water
would require to be in order that it should just be able to grow in
vapor of eightfold supersaturation, we obtain the very small value
6.4 by 10—* em. for the radius of such drops. Thus drops not large in
comparison with molecular dimensions might be expected to grow
into visible drops in an atmosphere supersaturated to this extent.

THE IONS AS CONDENSATION NUCLEI,

If we expose the cloud chamber of an expansion apparatus to the
action of Roentgen rays, the air having been previously freed from
dust, just the same expansion is required as in the absence of the
rays to produce drops, but now we get comparatively dens? fogs
in place of the rainlike condensation. The cloudlike condensation
obtained with expansions exceeding the second limit is not sensibly
affected. Thus, when X rays pass through moist air they produce
nuclei of exactly the same efficiency in promoting condensation as
those which are always being produced in small numbers and to
which the rainlike condensation is due. The conducting power
imparted to air by the action of X rays being explained as due to
the setting free of ions in the gas, it was natural to identify the
nuclei with the ions.

This view was verified by studying the action of an electric field
on the nuclei produced by X rays. Between two parallel plates,
which formed the top and bottom of the cloud chamber of an
expansion apparatus, a difference of potential of some hundred volts
could be applied. With the electric field acting, the number of drops
produced on expansion in air exposed to the rays was exceedingly
small in comparison with the number seen in the absence of the field.
The nuclei carry a charge of electricity, and are driven by the electric
field against the plates immediately after being set free. The direct
proof that the few nuclei, which are always present and give rise
to the rainlike condensation, are also ions has been more difficult to
‘arry out. Attempts made with small apparatus led to negative
results, the number of drops being inconveniently small whether the
field was applied or not. Recent experiments on a large scale, how-
ever, showed in a striking way the removal of these nuclei by the
electric field. The subject has been further cleared up by the inde-
pendent proof by purely electrical measurements that the air in a
closed vessel is continually being ionized.
CONDENSATION NUOLEI. yA |

Air ionized by any of the various types of Becquerel rays or con-
taining ions from a zime plate exposed to weak ultra-violet light
behaves on expansion like air exposed to X rays, fogs being produced
in air initially saturated if the lower expansion mit ¢,/7,—1.25 be
exceeded. The action of an electric field in removing the nuclei is

the same in air ionized by Becquerel rays as in air ionized by X rays.
The ions produced by the discharge from a point are similar in their
action, but there is here a tendeney, due probably to the products of
chemical combinations brought about by the luminous discharge, for
the nuclei to grow or for larger uncharged nuclei to be formed, so
that a much smaller degree of supersaturation may be required to
produce a cloud. The ions produced by these various methods are
also identical in the velocity with which they move through air
under a given potential gradient. The degree of supersaturation
required to make water condense on the ions is independent of
the gas.

If we make use of the equation which has been given above, con-
necting the maximum supersaturation with the charge of the drop,
we obtain the result e=6 10—° electrostatic units for a fourfold
supersaturation. To obtain this number, we have, of course, ex-
tended to drops of almost molecular smallness, 7=7>< 10—*
equation which could only be used with confidence when the radius

em., an

was at least a thousand times as great. It is therefore somewhat
remarkable that the value obtained approximates fairly closely to
the values found by J. J. Thomson and by H. A. Wilson for the
ionic charge. The action of the ions as condensation nuclei is not,
however, completely explained, for our formula would make effi-
ciency of the electrification in helping condensation independent of
the sign of the charge. Now, the negative ions are found to require
a less degree of supersaturation to make water form visible drops
upon them than do the positive.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IONS.

To study this question we may use an expansion apparatus pro-
vided with a cloud chamber, in which the air under examination
is contained between two herizontal plates kept at shghtly different
potentials. A thin stratum of the air immediately over the lower
plate is exposed to the action of X rays. A series of observations
are then made, in which the rays are cut off at a definite interval of
time before the expansion is made, the interval being such that all
the downward-moving ions have had time to reach the lower plate
while only a small proportion of the upward-moving ones have

tically ions of only one kind present, those, namely, which are moy-
ing toward the upper plate.

In this way it has been found that in order that water may con-
dense upon them to form visible drops the negative ions require an
expansion v,/v, = 1.25, the positive an expansion 1.31, the corre-
sponding supersaturations being fourfold and sixfold, respectively.

When ions of both kinds are present in approximately equal num-
bers, 1t is often possible to observe a difference in the density of the
resulting cloud according as the expansion is below or above the limit
corresponding to the degree of supersaturation necessary for the con-
densation of the positive ions. The increase in density was first
described by J. J. Thomson, and it was suggested by him that it
might be due to a difference between the positive and negative ions
in their efficiency as condensation nuclei; he pointed out that such a
difference, if established, would have important bearings on the sub-
ject of atmospheric electricity. For an electrical field might be
expected to result in ionized air if such a degree of supersaturation
was reached that condensation took place on ions of one kind only,
these loaded ions being then carried down by gravity. That the
drops produced under these conditions are actually negatively
charged, as was to be expected from the greater efficiency of the
negative lon as a nucleus, was proved by H. A. Wilson, by observing
the movement of the drops in a strong electric field applied after their
formation by expansion.

CHARGE CARRIED BY THE IONS.

The most important use which has been made of the fact that ions
act as nuclei for the condensation of water vapor has been in the
determination of the quantity of electricity carried by each ion. Two
entirely different methods have been employed, both requiring the
use of the expansion apparatus. In the first, that of J. J. Thomson,
a measurement of the leakage of electricity through the au of the
cloud chamber allows v, e, the product of the number of ions and the
ionic charge, to be measured; 7, the number of the ions is given by the
number of the drops. The number has been obtained, not by direct
counting, but from a knowledge of the quantity of water condensed,
and the size of the drops as obtained from thei rate of fall. The
second method (used by H. A. Wilson) in its simplest form reduces
itself to a determination of the strength of the electric field necessary
to maintain in suspension the drops condensed upon the ions. We
then have /’ e, the product of the strength of the field and the charge
on the drop, equal to its weight. ‘The size of the drops, and hence
their weight, is again deduced from the rate of fall in the absence of
the field.
CONDENSATION NUOLEI. 203
OTHER PROPERTIES OF THE IONS.

There is no room -for doubt that the nuclei produced by X rays
and similar agents, and requiring a fourfold or sixfold supersatura-
tion to make water condense on them, are negatively or positively
charged ions. We know by other methods of studying them a great
deal about the properties of ions, their velocity in an electric field,
their diffusion constants and rates of recombination under different
conditions. Their behavior when studied by condensation has been
entirely in agreement with the results obtained by other methods;
for example, the rapidity with which their number diminishes after
the source of ionization has been cut off.

NUCLEI SIMILAR IN EFFICIENCY TO THE IONS, BUT NOT REMOVABLE BY AN
ELECTRICAL FIELD.

Moist air exposed to weak ultraviolet light is found to contain
a plentiful supply of nuclei, which require a degree of supersatura-
tion approximately the same as do the ions, in order that a cloud may
form upon them. Yet even very strong electric fields appear to be
without effect in reducing the number of drops formed on expansion.
Certain metals also produce in the air in contact with them similar
nuclei, the clouds in this case, however, not generally attaining any
considerable density, unless the expansion is great enough to cause
condensation on positive ions. It is possible that we have in both
these cases ions produced as a result of the expansion, there being,
therefore, no time for the ions to be removed by the field before the
cloud is formed.

NUCLEI MORE EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING CONDENSATION THAN THE IONS
PRODUCED BY X RAYS.

If we expose moist air to ultraviolet of moderate intensity, the
result is not so simple as when the intensity is very small. Nuclei
are produced which appear to grow under the action of the light,
the expansion required to produce a cloud becoming less than that
required by the negative ions, and becoming less and less the stronger
the light and the longer the exposure. For a given intensity of the
light, there appears to be a maximum size beyond which the nuclei
cease to grow. A very moderate intensity is sufficient to produce
nuclei which grow till the shghtest expansion will form a cloud, and
the growth is very rapid, so that the earlier stages are difficult to fol-
low. With very intense ultraviolet hght, the growth continues till
the nuclei become visible in suitable illumination, and we get a cloud
without expansion, even in unsaturated air. There can be little doubt
that the growth of these nuclei into visible drops is to be attributed
to the formation of some substance in solution within them. Vincent

has recently studied these visible nuclei and found some of the
particles to be positively, some negatively charged, and others neu-
tral; but he finds the evidence to be in favor of the view that the
charges are, as it were, accidental, being simply due to ions which have
come in contact with them. Lenard had previously shown the ioniza-
tion of the air by these rays.

The very small nuclei—i. e., those which require large expansions
to make drops form upon them—diffuse rapidly to the sides of the
vessel, so that a fog is not formed if the radiation be cut off even one
minute before the expansion is made. The nuclei which are large
enough to be visible may persist for hours on account of thei very
slow diffusion.

Other nuclei which, like those produced by ultraviolet light, vary
in size with varying conditions are those produced by heating a wire,
studied some time ago by Aitken and recently by Owen. The latter
has shown that the lower the temperature at which they have been
given off by the wire the greater is the expansion required to catch
them. They can be detected when the wire has been raised to a tem-
perature of less than 150° C. in air. The nuclei produced by the slow
oxidation of phosphorus, like those formed by the action of strong
ultraviolet ight, form visible clouds in air which is not supersatu-
rated. These clouds have been studied by Barus and others. As in
the cases just considered, the production of the nuclei is associated
with the acquisition of conducting power by the gas. There has been
a considerable amount of controversy as to the nature of the conduc-
tion of electricity in air which has passed over phosphorus. The
experiments of Bloch ® have, however, proved, from the nature of the
curve obtained for the relation between current and potential differ-
ence, that we have here a true case of ionization. His measurements
of the velocity of the ions showed that they have a very small mobil-
ity as compared with the ions due to X rays. His experiments leave
little room for doubt that these slow-moving ions are identical with
the nuclei. The mobility is about a thousand times as small as that
of the ions formed by X rays.

Certain experiments of Harms.’ and of Elster and Geitel,° appear
to show that by the oxidation of phosphorus free ions are produced
in addition to the visible cloud particles. These we should expect. to
be rapidly removed by diffusion and recombination, and, after pass-
ing through any considerable length of tubing, we should expect only.
the loaded ions to persist. The absence of unloaded ions in Bloch’s
experiments is perhaps to be explained in this way.

CONDENSATION NUCLEI. 905

The nuclei found in freshly prepared gases, and studied especially
by Townsend, resemble in many ways those resulting from the oxida-
tion of phosphorus. Like them, they form clouds without supersatu-
ration, and they carry a charge of electricity. In some cases, at least,
as was shown by Townsend’s experiments, the charge on each nucleus
is the ionic charge. Bloch has studied the mobility of these ions,
and in agreement with Townsend has found it to be of the same order
as that of the phosphorus ions.

By the splashing of water or aqueous solutions, or the bubbling of
air through water or solutions, nuclei are produced requiring only a
shght expansion in order that water may condense upon them. These
nuclei have lately been studied by Barus. He finds that the nuclei
produced from salt solutions are much more persistent than those
arising from distilled water. It is most natural to regard these
nuclei, as does Barus, as sinall drops which have evaporated till the
strength of the solution is such that the effect of the dissolved sub-
stance on the vapor pressure counterbalances that of the surface ten-
sion. The splashing or bubbling process also imparts temporary
conducting power to the gas. According to Kaehler, with pure dis-
tilled water the conduction is practically unipolar and due to the pres-
ence of negative ions having a mobility equal to that of the ions pro-
duced by XX rays. With salt water positive ions of very small
mobility are produced in addition.

In the products of combustion from flames we find again ions of
small mobility, and no appreciable degree of supersaturation is re-
quired to produce a cloud.

As Bloch points out, there are apparently two classes of ions. We
have, first, jons lke those produced by N rays and similar agents,
which have a definite velocity in an electric field of given strength
and require a definite degree of supersaturation—fourfold or sixfold,

according to the sign of the charge—in order that water may con-
dense upon them.

The second class consists of ions of variable mobility, about one-
thousandth part of that of the ions of the first class, and they have the
power of condensing water to form visible drops without supersat-
uration. Tons with intermediate properties are rarely, if ever, met
with. Bloch points out that we should expect an important differ-
ence between the two classes with respect to the result of recombination
of positive and negative ions. In the first class the nucleus owes its
existence to the charge; if two oppositely charged ions (which we
may regard as minute charged drops) combine, we should expect the
resultant uncharged nucleus to evaporate at once. On the other
hand, the persistence of the ions of the second class can not be due to
the charge alone, and neutralization of the charge will not result in

@ Barus, The Structure of the Nucleus.

.
206 CONDENSATION NUCLEI.

evaporation of the nucleus. From recombination of these ions per-
sistent uncharged nuclei will result. The facts are found to be in com-
plete accord with these considerations.

If we produce a cloud in dust-free air by an expansion exceeding
1.25 after exposure to X rays, or exceeding 1.38 in the absence of
ionizing agents, the drops formed, if made to evaporate by com-
pression, appear to leave behind nuclei requiring only slight ex-
pansion to make water condense on them. J.J. Thomson has pointed
out that there may be a certain size for which even uncharged drops
of pure water may be stable mm an unsaturated atmosphere. For,
according to the experiments of Reinold and Riicker, the surface
tension of thin films has a minimum for a certain thickness. There
may, therefore, be a certain size (somewhat smaller than that corre-
sponding to minimum surface tension) for which the potential energy
of a drop due to surface tension has a minimum value. Such a drop
would be in equilibrium in vapor saturated with respect to a flat
surface.

Bloch, following Langevin, works out, in the paper already re-
ferred to, the theory of condensation of water vapor on ions. He
shows that we might expect drops of about 10 jin diameter to be
stable, on account of the variation in surface tension in that region,
but we should not expect to meet with drops of which the diameter
was comprised between that limit and a very low value, the equilib-
rium of such particles being unstable. The behavior of other sub-
stances than water would probably be similar. In this way Bloch
explains the fact that we do not meet with ions of mobility inter-
mediate between about 1 centimeter and one three-hundredths centi-
meter per second for a field of 1 volt per centimeter.

There are then three principal classes of nuclei: (1) The ions
proper, requiring a fourfold or sixfold supersaturation to cause water
to condense on them, and having a mobility exceeding 1 centimeter
per second in.a field of 1 volt per centimeter; (2) loaded ions requir-
ing little or no supersaturation to make water condense on them, and
having a mobility generally less than a thousandth part of that of the
ions proper; (3) uncharged nuclei, resembling the second class in
requiring little or no supersaturation in order that visible drops may
form upon them.

“ Nucleation during cold weather,’ by Dr. Carl Barus, which ap-
peared in the Physical Review for April, 1903—are here appended to
show in a graphic manner the number of nuclei in atmospheric
air. Doctor Barus, who prepared these charts, has for several years
been conducting investigations on this subject, under the auspices of
the Smithsonian Institution, which has published several of his

memoirs.—Ep1Tor. |

PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.‘
By Sin WILLIAM Ramsay, K. C. B., F. R. S.

To discuss the “ present problems of inorganic chemistry ” is by no
means an easy task. The expression might be taken to mean an
account of what is being actually done at present by those engaged
in inorganic research; or it might be taken to relate to what needs
doing—to the direction in which research is required. ‘To summarize
what is being done in an intelligible manner in the time at my dis-
posal would be an almost impossible task: hence I will choose the lat-
ter interpretation of the title of my address. Now, a considerable
experience in attempting to unveil the secrets of nature has convinced
me that a deliberate effort to discover some new law or fact seldom
succeeds. The investigator generally begins unmethodically, by ran-
dom and chance experiments; or perhaps he is guided by some indica-
tion which has struck his attention during some previous research ;
and he is often the plaything of circumstances in his choice. Expe-
rience leads him to choose problems which most readily admit of solu-
tion, or which appear likely to lead to the most interesting results.
Tf I may be excused the egotism of referring to my own work, I may
illustrate what I mean by relating the following curious coincidence :
After Lord Rayleigh had announced his discovery that * atmospheric
nitrogen * was denser than * chemical nitrogen,” I referred to Caven-
dish’s celebrated paper on the combination of the nitrogen and the
oxygen of the air by means of electric sparks. Fortified by what I
read, and by the knowledge gained during the performance of lecture
experiments that red-hot magnesium is a good and fairly rapid
absorbent of nitrogen, if was not long before a considerable quantity
of nearly pure argon had been separated from: atmospheric nitrogen.
Now it happened that I possess two copies of Cavendish’s works; and
some months afterwards I consulted the other copy and found pen-
ciled on the margin the words “ look into this.” I remembered the
‘circumstance which led to the annotation. About ten years before,

aAn address at the International Congress of Arts and Science, St. Louis,
September, 1904. Here printed by permission of the author.

208 PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

one of my students had investigated the direct combination of nitro-
gen and hydrogen, and I had read Cavendish’s memoir on that occa-
sion. I mention this fact to show that for some reason which I for-
get, a line of work was not followed up, which would have been
attended by most interesting results; one does not always follow the
clue which yields results of the greatest interest. [regard it, therefore,
as an impossible task to indicate the lines on which research should be
carried out. All that I can do is to call attention to certain problems
awaiting solution; but their relative importance must necessarily be a
matter of personal bias, and others might with perhaps greater right
suggest wholly different problems.

The fundamental task of inorganic chemistry is still connected
with the classification of elements and compounds. The investiga-
tion of the classification of carbon compounds forms the field of
organic chemistry, while general or physical chemistry deals with
the laws of reaction and the influence of various forms of energy in
furthering or hindering chemical change. And classification centers
at present in the periodic arrangement of the elements, according to
the order of their atomic weights. Whatever changes in our views
may be concealed in the lap of the future, this great generalization,
due to Newlands, Lothar Meyer, and Mendelejeyv, will always retain
a place, perhaps the prominent place, in chemical science.

Now, it is certain that no attempt to reduce the irregular regularity
of the atomic weights to a mathematical expression has succeeded ;
and it is, in my opinion, very unlikely that any such expression, of
not insuperable complexity, and having a basis of physical meaning,
will ever be found. I have already, in an address to the German
Association at Cassel, given an outline of the grand problem which
awaits solution. It can be shortly stated then: While the factors
of kinetic and of gravitational energy, velocity, and momentum on
the one hand and force and distance on the other are simply related
to each other, the capacity factors of other forms of energy—surface,
in the case of surface energy; volume, in the case of volume energy ;
entropy for heat; electric capacity, when electric charges are being
conveyed by means of ions; atomic weight, when chemical energy is
being gained or lost—all these are simply connected with the funda-
mental chemical capacity, atomic weight, or mass. The periodic
arrangement is an attempt to bring the two sets of capacity factors
into a simple relation to each other; and while the attempt is in so
far a success, inasmuch as it is evident that some law is indicated, the
divergences are such as to show that finality has not been attained.
The central problem in inorganic chemistry is to answer the question,
Why this incomplete concordance? Having stated the general ques-

tion, it may conduce to clearness if some details are given.
1. The variation of molecular surface energy with temperature is
PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 909

such that the surface energy for equal numbers of molecules distrib-
uted over a surface is equal for equal intervals of temperature below
the temperature at which surface energy is zero—that is, the critical
point. This gives a means of determining the molecular weights of
liquids, and we assume that the molecular weight of a compound is
accurately the sum of the atomic weights of the constituent elements.

2. The volume energy of gases is equal at equal temperature from
that at which volume energy is zero—i. e., absolute zero. And it fol-
lows that those volumes of gases which possess equal volume energy
contain equal numbers of molecules—again, a close connection with
atomic weights.

3. The specific heats of elements are approximately inversely pro-
portional to their atomic weights, and of compounds to the quotient
of their molecular weights divided by the number of atoms in the
molecule. Specific heat and entropy are closely related; hence one
of the factors of thermal energy is proportional (nearly) to the
reciprocal of the atomic weights.

4. The ion carries in its migration through a solution one or more
electrons. Now, the ion is an atom carrying one or more charges
one for each equivalent. Here we have the capacity for electric
charge proportional to the equivalent.

5. The factors of chemical energy are atomic weight and chemical
potential; and as the former is identical numerically, or after multi-
plication by a simple factor with equivalent, electric potential is
proportional to chemical potential.

We see, therefore, that surface, volume, thermal, electrical, and,
no doubt, other forms of energy have as capacity factors magnitudes
either identical with or closely related to units of chemical capacity
while kinetic and linear energy are not so related, except through
the periodic arrangement of the elements.

It appears, therefore, to be a fundamental problem for the chemist
to ascertain, first, accurate atomic weights, and, second, to investi-
gate some anomalies which still present difficulties. In America you
nave excellent workers in the former branch. Mallet, Morley,
Richards, and many others have devoted their time and skill to per-
aaps the best work of this kind which has been done, and F. W.
Clarke has collated all results and afforded incaleulable help to all
who work at or are interested in the subject. Valuable criticisms,
too, have been made by Hinrichs; but it must be confessed that, in
spite of these, which are perhaps the best determinations which have
been made, the problem becomes more and not less formidable.

There are lines of work, however, which suggest themselves as pos-
sibly likely to throw light on the question. First, there is a striking
anomaly in the atomic weight of nitrogen, determined by analysis

sm 1904——14

.
210 PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

and determined by density. Stas obtained the number 14.04 (O16),
and Richards has recently confirmed his results, while Rayleigh and
Ledue consistently obtained densities which, even when corrected so
as to equalize the numbers of molecules in equal volumes, give the
lower figure 14.002. The difference is 1 in 350—far beyond any pos-
sible experimental error. Recently an attempt to combine the two
methods has led to a mean number, but that result can hardly be
taken as final. What is the reason of the discrepancy? Its discovery
will surely advance knowledge materially. I would suggest the
preparation of pure compounds of nitrogen, such as salts of hydra-
zine, methylanine, ete., and their careful analysis, and also the
accurate determination of the density and analysis of such gaseous
compounds of nitrogen as nitric oxide and peroxide. I have just
heard from my former student, W. R. W. Gray, that he has recovered
Stas’s number by combining 2NO with O,, while the density of NO
leads to the lower value for the atomic weight of nitrogen.

The question of the atomic weight of tellurium appears to be set-
tled, at least so far as its position with regard to the generally
accepted atomic weight of 1odine is concerned. Recent determina-
tions give the figures 127.5 (Gutbier), 127.6 (Pellini), and 127.9
(Ko6thner). But is that of iodine as accurately known? It. would
appear advisable to revise the determination of Stas, preparing the
iodine preferably from an organic compound, such as iodoform,
which can be produced in a high state of purity. The heteromor-
phism of selenates and tellurates, too, has recently been demonstrated,
and it may be questioned whether these elements should both belong
to the same group.

The rare earths still remain a puzzle. Their number is increas-
“ing yearly, and their claim to individuality admits of less and less
dispute. What is to be done with them? Are they to be grouped by
themselves as Brauner and Steele propose? If so, how is their con-
nection with the other elements to be explained? Recent experiments
in my laboratory have convinced me that in the case of thorium, at
least, ordinary tests of purity, such as fine crystals, constant subliming
point, etc., do not always indicate homogeneity: or else that we are
sadly in want of some analytical method of sufficient accuracy. The

change of thorium into thorium X is perhaps hardly an explanation
of the divergencies; yet it must be considered; but of this, more anon.

To turn next to another problem closely related to the orderly
arrangement of the elements, that of valency, but little progress can
be chronicled. The suggestions which have been made are specula-
tive rather than based on experiment. ‘The existence of many peroxi-
dized substances, such as percarbonates, perborates, persulphates and
of crystalline compounds of salts with hydrogen peroxide, makes it
difficult to draw any indisputable conclusions as regards valency from
PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 75 ik

a consideration of oxygen compounds. Moissan’s brilliant work on
fluorides, however, has shown that SF, is capable of stable existence,
and this forms a strong argument in support of the hexad character
of sulphur. The tetravalency of oxygen, under befitting conditions,
too, is being acknowledged, and this may be reconciled with the
existence of water of crystallization, as well as of the per-salts already
mentioned. The adherence of ammonia to many chlorides, nitrates,
ete., points to the connecting link being ascribable to the pentavalency
of nitrogen; and it might be worth while investigating similar com-
pounds with phosphoretted and arsenicorretted hydrogen, especially
at low temperatures.

The progress of chemical discovery, indeed, is closely connected
with the invention of new methods of research, or the submitting of
matter to new conditions. While Moissan led the way by elaborating
the electric furnace, and thus obtained a potent agent in temperatures
formerly unattainable, Spring has tried the effect of enormous pres-
sure, and has recently found chemical action between cuprous oxide
and sulphur at ordinary temperature, provided the pressure be raised
to 8,000 atmospheres. Increase of pressure appears to lower the tem-
perature of reaction. It has been known for long that explosions will
hot propagate in rarefied gases, and that they became more violent
when the reacting gases are compressed ; but we are met with difficul-
ties, such as the noncombination of hydrogen and nitrogen, even at
high temperature and great pressure; yet it is possible to measure the
electromotive force (0.59 volt) in a couple consisting of gaseous nitro-
gen and gaseous hydrogen, the electrolyte being a solution of ammo-
nium nitrate saturated with ammonia. Chemical action between dis-
solved hydrogen and nitrogen undoubtedly occurs; but it is not con-
tinuous. Again we may ask, Why? The heat evolution should be
great; the gain of entropy should also be high were direct combina-
tion to occur. Why does it not occur to any measurable extent? Is
it because for the initial stages of any chemical reaction the reacting
molecules must be already dissociated and those of nitrogen are not?
Is that in any way connected with the abnormally low density of
gaseous nitrogen? Or is it that, in order that combination shall
occur, the atoms must fit each other; and that in order that nitrogen
and hydrogen atoms may fit they must be greatly distorted? But
these are speculative questions, and it is not obvious how experiments
can be devised to answer them.

Many compounds are stable at low temperatures which dissociate
when temperature is raised. Experiments are being made, now that
liquid air is to be purchased or cheaply made, on the combinations of
substances which are indifferent to each. other at ordinary tempera-
tures. Yet the research must be a restricted one, for most substances
are solid at —185°, and refuse to act on each other. It is probable,

Y
212 PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

however, that at low temperatures compounds could be formed in
which one of the elements would possess a greater valency than that
usually ascribed to it; and also that double compounds of greater
complexity would prove stable. Valency, indeed, appears to be in
many cases a function of temperature; exothermic compounds, as
is well known, are less stable the higher the temperature. The sud-
den cooling of compounds produced at a high temperature may pos-
sibly result in forms being preserved which are unstable at ordinary
temperatures. Experiments have been made in the hope of obtaining
compounds of argon and helium by exposing various elements to the
influence of sparks from a powerful induction coil, keeping the walls
of the containing vessel at the temperature of liquid air, in the hope
that any endothermic compound which might be formed would be
rapidly cooled and would survive the interval of temperature at
which decomposition would take place naturally. But these experi-
ments have so far yielded only negative results. ‘There is some indi-
cation, however, that such compounds are stable at 1,500°. It might
be hoped that a study of the behavior of the nonvalent elements
would have led to some conception of the nature of valency, but so
far no results bearing on the question have transpired. The condi-
tion of helium in the minerals from which it is obtainable by heat is
not explained, and experiments in this direction have not furnished
any positive information. It is always doubtful whether it is advis-
able to publish the results of negative experiments, for it is always
possible that some more skilled or more fortunate investigator may
succeed where one has failed. But it may be chronicled that attempts
to cause combination between the inactive gases and lithium, potas-
sium, rubidium, and cxsium have yielded no positive results, nor
do they appear to react with fluorine. Yet conditions of experiment
play a leading part in causing combinations, as has been well shown
by Moissan with the hydrides of the alkali metals, and by Guntz,
with those of the metals of the alkaline earths. The proof that
sodium hydride possesses the formula NaH, instead of the formerly
accepted one, removes one difficulty in the problem of valency, and
SrH, falls into its natural position among hydrides.

A fertile field of inorganic research lies in the investigation of
structure. While the structure of organic compounds has been eluei-
dated almost completely, that of inorganic compounds is practically
undeveloped. Yet efforts have been made in this direction which
appear to point a way. The nature of the silicates has been the sub-
ject of research for many years by F. W. Clarke, and the way has
been opened. Much may be done by treating silicates with appropri-
ate solvents, acid or alkaline, which differentiate between uncombined
and combined silica, and which in some cases, by replacement of cone
metal by another, gives a clue to constitution. The complexity of the
PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. O13

molecules of inorganic compounds, which are usually solid, forms
another bar to investigation. It is clear that sulphuric acid, to choose
a common instance, possesses a very complicated molecule, and the
fused nitrates of sodium and potassitun are not correctly represented
by the simple formule NaNO, and KNO,. Any theory of the struc-
ture of their derivatives must take such facts into consideration ; but
we appear to be getting nearer the elucidation of the molecular
weights of solids. Again, the complexity of solutions of the most
common salts is maintained by many investigators. For example, a
solution of cobalt chloride, while it undoubtedly contains, among
other constituents, simple molecules of CoCl,, also consists of ions of
a complex character, such as (CoC1,)’7.. And what holds for cobalt
chloride also undoubtedly holds for many similar compounds.

In determining the constitution of the compounds of carbon, stereo-
chemistry has played a great part. The ordinary structural formule
are now universally acknowledged to be only pictorial, if, indeed, that
word is legitimate. Perhaps it would be better to say that they are
distorted attempts at pictures, the drawing of which is entirely free
from all rules of perspective. But these formule may in almost
every case be made nearly true pictures of the configuration of the
molecules. The benzine formula, to choose an instance which is by
no means the simplest, has been shown by Collie to be imitated by a
model which represents in an unstrained manner the behavior of
that body on treatment with reagents. But in the domain of inor-
ganic chemistry little progress has been made. Some ingenious ideas
of the geologist Sollas on this problem have hardly received the atten-
tion which they deserve. Perhaps they may have been regarded as
too speculative. On the other hand, Le Bel’s and Pope’s proof of the
stereo-isomerism of certain compounds of nitrogen, Pope’s demon-
stration of the tetrahedral structure of the alkyl derivatives of tin,
and Smiles’s syntheses of stereo-isomeric sulphur compounds give us
the hope that further investigation will lead to the classification of
many other elements from this point of view. Indeed, the field is
almost virgin soil, but it is well worth while cultivating. There is
no doubt that the investigation of other organo-metallic compounds
will result in the discovery of stereo-isomerides; yet the methods of
mvestigation capable of separating such constituents have in most
cases still to be discovered.

The number of chemical isomerides among inorganic compounds
is a restricted one. Werner has done much to elucidate this sub-
ject in the case of complex ammonia derivatives of metals and their
salts; but there appears to be little doubt that if looked for, the
same or similar phenomena would be discoverable in compounds
with much simpler formule. The two forms of So,, sulphuric an-
hydride, are an instance in point. No doubt formation under dif-
214 PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

ferent conditions of temperature and pressure might result in the
greater stability of some forms which under our ordinary condi-
tions are changeable and unstable. The fact that under higher
pressures than are generally at our disposal different forms of ice
have been proved to exist, and the application of the phase rule to
such cases, will greatly enlarge our knowledge of molecular isom-
erism.

The phenomena of catalysis have been extensively studied of
recent years, and have obviously an important bearing on such
problems. A catalytic agent is one which accelerates or retards
the velocity of reaction. Without inquiring into the mechanism
of catalysis, its existence may be made to influence the rate of chem-
ical change and to render stable bodies which under ordinary con-
ditions are unstable. For if it is possible to accelerate a chemical
change in such a way that the usually slow and possibly unrecog-
nizable rate of isomeric change may be made apparent and meas-
urable, a substance the existence of which could not be recognized
under ordinary circumstances, owing to its infinitesimal amount,
may be induced to exist in weighable quantity if the velocity of its
formation from an isomeride can be greatly accelerated by the
presence of an appropriate catalytic agent. I am not aware that
attempts have been made in this direction. The discovery of cata-
lytic agents is, as a rule, the result of accident. IT do not think that
any guide exists which would enable us to predict that any particu-
lar substance would cause an acceleration or a retardation of any
particular reaction. But catalytic agents are generally those which
themselves, by their power of combining with or parting with
oxygen, or some other element, cause the transfer of that element
to other compounds to take place with increased or diminished
velocity. It is possible, therefore, to cause ordinary reactions to
take place in presence of a third body, choosing the third body with
a view to its catalytic action, and to examine carefully the produets
of the main reaction as regards their nature and their quantity.
Attempts have been made in this direction with marked success;
the rate of change of hydrogen dioxide, for example, has been fairly
well studied. But what has been done for that compound may be
extended indefinitely to others, and, doubtless, with analogous re-
sults. Indications of the existence of as yet undiscovered compounds
may be derived from a study of physical, and particularly of elec-
trical, changes. There appears to be sufficient evidence of an oxide
of hydrogen containing more oxygen than hydrogen dioxide, from
a study of the electromotive force of a cell containing hydrogen
dioxide; vet the higher oxide still awaits discovery.

The interpretation of chemical change in the light of the ionic
PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 215

theory may now be taken as an integral part of inorganic chemistry.
The ordinary reactions _of qualitative and quantitative analysis are
now almost universally aseribed to the ions, not to the molecules.
And the study of the properties of most ions falls into the province
of the inorganic chemist. To take a familiar example: The precipi-
tation of hydroxides by means of ammonia solution has long led to
the hypothesis that the solution contained ammonium hydroxide, and,
indeed, the teaching of the text-books and the labels on the bottles
supported this view. But we know now that a solution of ammonia
in water is a complex mixture of liquid ammonia and liquid water; of
ammonium hydroxide, NH,OH; and of ions of ammonium (NH,)’,
and hydroxyl (OH)’. Its reactions, therefore, are those of such a
complex mixture. If brought into contact with a solution of some
substance which will withdraw the hydroxyl ions, converting them
into water, or into some nonionized substance, they are replaced at
the expense of the molecules of nonionized ammonium hydroxide ; and
these, when diminished in amount, draw on the store of molecules of
ammonia and water, which combine, so as to maintain equilibrium.
Now, the investigation of such changes must belong to the domain of
inorganic chemistry. It is true that the methods of investigation
are borrowed from the physical chemist; but the products le in the
province of the inorganic chemist. Indeed, the different departments
of chemistry are so interlaced that it is impossible to pursue investiga-
tions in any one branch without borrowing methods from the others;
and the inorganic chemist must be familiar with all chemistry if he
is to make notable progress in his own branch of the subject. And
if the substances and processes investigated by the inorganic chemist
are destined to become commercially important, it is impossible to
place the manufacturer on a sound commercial basis without ample
knowledge of physical methods and their application to the most
economical methods of accelerating certain reactions and retarding
others, so as to obtain the largest yield of the required product at the
smallest cost of time, labor, and money.

I have endeavored to sketch some of the aspects of inorganic chem-
istry with a view to suggesting problems for solution, or at least the
directions in which such problems are to be sought. But the develop-
ments of recent years have been so astonishing and so unexpected
that I should fail in my duty were I not to allude to the phenomena
of radio-activity and their bearing on the subject of my address. It
is difficult to gauge the relative importance of investigations in this
field; but I may be pardoned if I give a short account of what has
already been done and point out lines of investigation which appear
to me likely to yield useful results. .

The wonderful discovery of radium by Madame Curie, the prepara-
216 PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

tion of practically pure compounds of it, and the determination of its
atomic weight are familiar to all of you. Her discovery of polonium,
and Debierne’s of actinium have also attracted much attention. The
recognition of the radio-activity of uranium by Becquerel, which gave
the first impulse to these discoveries, and of that of thorium by
Schmidt is also well known.

These substances, however, presented at first more interest for the
physicist than the chemist, on account of the extraordinary power
which they all possess of emitting “rays.” At first these rays were
supposed to constitute ethereal vibrations, but all the phenomena
were not explicable on that supposition. Schmidt first, and Ruther-
ford and Soddy later, found that certain so-called “ rays” really
consist of gases, and that while thorium emits one kind radium
emits another, and no doubt Debierne’s actinium emits a third. The
name “ emanations” was applied by Rutherford to such radio-active
bodies. He and Soddy found that those of radium and thorium could
be condensed and frozen by exposure to the temperature of liquid
air, and that they were not destroyed or altered in any way by treat-
ment with agents which are able to separate all known gases from
those of the argon group, namely. red-hot magnesium lime, and it
was later found that sparking with oxygen in presence of caustic
potash did not affect the gaseous emanation from radium. The con-
clusion therefore followed that in all probability these bodies are
gases of the argon group, the atomic weight of which, and conse-
quently the density, is very high. Indeed, several observers, by means
of experiments on the rate of diffusion of the gas from radium, believe
it to have a density of approximately 100, referred to the hydrogen
standard. This conclusion has been confirmed by the mapping of the
spectrum of the radium emanation, which is similar in general char-
acter to the spectra of the inactive gases, consisting of a number of
well-defined, clearly cut brilliant lines, standing out from a black
background. The volume of the gas produced spontaneously from a
given weight of radium bromide in a given time has been measured ;
and it was incidentally shown that this gas obeys Boyle’s law of pres-
sures. The amount of gas thus collected and measured, however, was
very minute; the total quantity was about the forty-thousandth of a
cubic centimeter.

Having noticed that those minerals which consist of compounds
of uranium and thorium contain helium, Rutherford and Soddy made
the suggestion that it might not be impossible that helium is the
product of the spontaneous change of the emanation; and Soddy and
I were able to show that this is actually the case. For, first, when a
quantity of a radium salt which has been prepared for some time is
dissolved in water the occluded helium is expelled and can be recog-
PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. DAG
nized by means of its spectrum; further, the fresh emanation shows
no helium spectrum, but after a few days the spectrum of helium
begins to appear, proving that a spontaneous change is in progress;
and last, as the emanation disappears its volume decreases to zero:
and on heating the capillary glass tube which contained it, helium
is driven out from the glass walls, into which its molecules had been
embedded in volume equal to three and a half times that of the emana-
tion. The @-rays, as foreshadowed by Rutherford and Soddy, con-
sist of helium particles.

All these facts substantiate the theory, devised by Rutherford and
Soddy, that the radium atom is capable of disintegration, one of the
products being a gas, which itself undergoes further disintegration,
forming helium as one of its products. Up till now the sheet anchor
of the chemists has been the atom. But the atom itself appears to
be complex, and to be capable of decomposition. It is true that only
in the case of a very few elements, and these of high atomic weight,
has this been proved. But even radium, the element which has by
far the most rapid rate of disintegration, has a comparatively long
life: the period of half-change of any given mass of radium is ap-
proximately eleven hundred years. The rate of change of the other
elements is Incomparably slower. This change, too, at least in the
case of radium, and its emanation, and presumably also in the case
of other elements, is attended with an enormous loss of energy. It
is easy to calculate from heat measurements (and independent and
concordant measurements have been made) that 1 pound of emana-
tion is capable of parting with as much energy as several hundred
tons of nitroglycerine. The order of the quantity of energy evolved
during the disintegration of the atom is as astonishing as the nature
of the change. But the nature of the change is parallel to what
would take place if an extremely complicated hydrocarbon were to
disintegrate; its disruption into simpler paraffins and olefines would
also be attended with loss of energy. We may therefore take it, I
think, that the disintegration hypothesis of Rutherford and Soddy
is the only one which will meet the case.

If radium is continually disappearing, and would totally disap-
pear ina very few thousand vears, it follows that it must be repro-
duced from other substances, at an equal rate. The most evident
conjecture, that it is formed from uranium, has not been substan-
tiated. Soddy has shown that salts of uranium, freed from radium,
and left for a year, do not contain one ten-thousandth part of the
‘adium that one would expect to be formed in the time. It is evi-
dent, therefore, that radium must owe its existence to the presence of
some other substances, but what they are is still unascertained.

During the investigation of Rutherford and Soddy of the thorium
218 PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

emanation, a most interesting fact was observed, namely, that. pre-
cipitation of the thorium as hydroxide by ammonia left unprecipi-
tated a substance, which they termed “ thorium-X,” and which was
itself highly radio-active. Its radio-active life, however, was a short
one; and as it decayed, it was reproduced from its parent thorium at
an equal rate. Here is a case analogous to what was sought for with
radium and uranium; but evidently uranium is not the only parent
of radium; the operation is not one of parthenogenesis. Similar
facts have been elicited for uranium by Crookes.

The a-rays, caused by the disintegration of radium and of its em-
anation, are accompanied by rays of quite a different character;
they are the f-rays, identical with electrons, the mass of which has
been measured by J. J. Thomson and others. These particles are
projected with enormous velocity, and are capable of penetrating
glass and metal screens. The power of penetration appears to be
proportional to the amount of matter in the screen, estimated by its
density. These electrons are not matter; but, as I shall relate, they
are capable of causing profound changes in matter.

For the past year a solution of radium bromide has been kept in
three glass bulbs, each connected to a Topler pump by means of capil-
lary tubing. To insure these bulbs against accident each was sur-
rounded by a small beaker; it happened that one of these beakers
consisted mainly of potash glass;. the other two were of soda glass.
The potash-glass beaker became brown, while the two soda-glass
beakers became purple. I think there is every probability that the
colors are due to liberation of the metals. potassium and sodium in
the glass. They are contained in that very viscous liquid, glass, in
the colorless ionic state; but these ions are discharged by the /-rays
or negative electrons, and each metal imparts its own peculiar color
to the glass, as has been shown by Maxwell Garnett. This phe-
nomenon, however interesting, is not the one to which I desire to
draw special attention. It must be remembered that the beakers
have been exposed only to B-rays; @-rays have never been in contact
with them; they have never been bombarded by what is usually
ralled matter, except by the molecules of the surrounding air. Now,
these colored beakers are radio-active, and the radio-active film dis-
solves in water. After careful washing, the glass was no longer
radio-active. The solution contains an emanation, for on bubbling
air through it, and cooling the issuing air with liquid air, part of the
radio-active matter was retained in the cooled tube. This substance
ean be carried into an electroscope by a current of air, after the liquid
air has been withdrawn, and as long as the air current passes, the
electroscope is discharged; the period of decay of this emanation,
however, is very rapid, and on ceasing the current of air, the leaves of
PRESENT PROBLEMS OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 219

the electroscope cease to be discharged. In having such a short period
of existence, this emanation resembles the one from actinium.

Owing to the recess, only ew commencement has been made with the
investigation of the residue left on evaporation of the aqueous solu-
tion. On evaporation, the residue is strongly active. Some mercu-
~ous nitrate was then added to the dissolved residue, and it was treated
with hydrochloric acid in excess, to precipitate mercurous chloride.
The greater part of the active matter was thrown down with the mer-
curous chloride, hence it appears to form an insoluble chloride. The
mercurous chloride retained its activity unchanged in amount for
ten days. The filtrate from the mercurous chloride, on evaporation,
turned out to be active; and on precipitating mercuric sulphide in it,
the sulphide precipitate was also active; but its activity decayed in
one day. The filtrate from the mercuric sulphide gave inactive pre-
cipitates with ferric salts and ammonia, with zine salts and am-
monium sulphide, with calcium salts and ammonium carbonate: and
on final evaporation the residue was not radio-active. Hence the
active matter forms an insoluble chloride and sulphide. The pre-
cipitated mercurous chloride and mercuric sulphide were dissolved
in aqua regia, and the solution was evaporated. The residue was
dissolved in water, and left the dish inactive. But the solution gave
an insoluble sulphate, when barium chloride and sulphuric acid were
added to it, hence the radio-active element forms an insoluble sul-
phate, as well as an insoluble chloride and sulphide.

This is a sample of the experiments which have been made. It
may be remarked that the above results were obtained from a mixture
of the potash and soda glass; somewhat different results were ob-
tained from the potash glass alone. These changes appear to be due
to the conversion of one or more of the constituents of the glass into
other bodies. Needless to say, neither of the samples of glass con-
tained lead.

I have mentioned these experiments in detail, because I think they
suggest wholly new lines of investigation. It would appear that if
energy can be poured into a definite chemical matter, such as glass,
it undergoes some change, and gives rise to bodies capable of being
tested, for I imagine that radio-active forms of matter are produced,
either identical with or allied to those at present known. And just
as radium and other radio-active elements suffer degradation sponta-
neously, evolving energy, so I venture to think that if energy be con-
centrated in the molecules of ordinary forms of matter, a sort of poly-
merization is the result, and racio-active elements, probably elements
with high atomic weight, and themselves unstable, are formed. Of
course further research may greatly modify these views; but some
guide is necessary, and Mr. Ternent Cook, who has helped me in these

In the light of such facts, speculation on the periodic arrangement
of the elements is surely premature. It is open to anyone to make
suggestions; they are self-evident. Most of you will agree with the
saying, “It is easy to prophesy after the event.” I prefer to wait
until préphecy becomes easy.

IT must ask your indulgence for having merely selected a few out of
the many possible views as regards the problems of inorganic chem-
istry. I can only plead in excuse that my task is not an easy one;
and I venture to express the hope that some hght has been thrown on
the shady paths which penetrate that dark region which we term the
future.
EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR.*

By SIMON NEWCOMB.,

As we look at the assemblage gathered in this hall, comprising so
many names of widest renown in every branch of learning—we might
almost say in every field of human endeavor—the first inquiry sug-
gested must be after the object of our meeting. The answer is that
our purpose corresponds to the eminence of the assemblage. We aim
at nothing less than a survey of the realm of knowledge, as compre-
hensive as is permitted by the limitations of time and space. The
organizers of our congress have honored me with the charge of pre-
senting such preliminary view of its field as may make clear the
spirit of our undertaking. '

Certain tendencies characteristic of the science of our day clearly
suggest the direction of our thoughts most appropriate to the occasion.
Among the strongest of these is one toward laying greater stress on
questions of the beginning of things, and regarding a knowledge of
the laws of development of any object of study as necessary to the
understanding of its present form. It may be conceded that the
principle here involved is as applicable in the broad field before us as
in a special research into the properties of the minutest organism.
It therefore seems meet that we should begin by inquiring what
agency has brought about the remarkable development of science to
which the world of to-day bears witness. This view is recognized in
the plan of our proceedings by providing for each great department
of knowledge a review of its progress during the century that has
elapsed since the great event commemorated by the scenes outside this
hall. But such reviews do not make up that general survey of science
at large which is necessary to the development of our theme, and
which must include the action of causes that had their origin long
before our time. The movement which culminated in making the
nineteenth century ever memorable in history is the outcome of a

long series of causes, acting through many centuries, which are worthy

299 EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR.

of especial attention on such an occasion as this. In setting them
forth we should avoid laying stress on those visible manifestations
which, striking the eye of every beholder, are in no danger of being
overlooked, and search rather for those agencies whose activities
underhe the whole visible scene, but which are lable to be blotted
ont of sight by the very brilliancy of the results to which they have
given rise. It is easy to draw attention to the wonderful qualities
of the oak; but, from that very fact, it may be needful to point out
that the real wonder lies concealed in the acorn from which it grew.

Our inquiry into the logical order of the causes which have made
our civilization what it is to-day will be facilitated by bringing to
mind certain elementary considerations—ideas so familiar that setting
them forth may seem like citing a body of truisms—and yet so fre-
quently overlooked, not only individually, but in their relation to
each other, that the conclusion to which they lead may be lost to
sight. One of these propositions is that psychical rather than mate-
rial causes are those which we should regard as fundamental in direct-
ing the development of the social organism. The human intellect is
the really active agent in every branch of endeavor—the primum
mobile of civilization—and all those material manifestations to which
our attention is so often directed are to be regarded as secondary to
this first agency. If it be true that “in the world is nothing great
but man; im man is nothing great but mind,” then should the key-
note of our discourse be the recognition of this first and greatest of
powers.

Another well-known fact is that those applications of the forces
of nature to the promotion of human welfare which have made our
age what it is are of such comparatively recent origin that we need
go back only a single century to antedate their most important fea-
tures, and scarcely more than four centuries to find their beginnig.
It follows that the subject of our inquiry should be the commence-
ment, not many centuries ago, of a certain new form of intellectual
activity.

Having gained this point of view, our next inquiry will be into the
nature of that activity and its relation to the stages of progress which
preceded and followed its beginning. The superficial observer, who
sees the oak but forgets the acorn, might tell us that the special
qualities which have brought out such great results are expert scien-
tific knowledge and rare ingenuity, directed to the application of
the powers of steam and electricity. From this point of view the
great inventors and the great captains of industry were the first
agents in bringing about the modern era. But the more careful
inquirer will see that the work of these men was possible only through
a knowledge of the laws of nature, which had been gained by men
whose work took precedence of theirs in logical order, and that
EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR. 223

success In invention has been measured by completeness in such knowl-
edge. While giving alludue honor to the great inventors, let us
remember that the first place is that of the great investigators, whose
forceful intellects opened the way to secrets previously hidden from
men. Let it be an honor and not a reproach to these men that they
were not actuated by the love of gain, and did not keep utilitarian
ends in view in the pursuit of their researches. If it seems that in
neglecting such ends they were leaving undone the most important
part of their work, let us remember that nature turns a forbidding
face to those who pay her court with the hope of gain, and is respon-
stve only to those suitors whose love for ber is pure and undefiled.
Not only is the special genius required in the investigator not that
generally best adapted to applying the discoveries which he makes,
but the result of his having sordid ends in view would be to narrow
the field of his efforts and exercise a depressing effect upon his activi-
ties. The true man of science has no such expression in his vocabu-
lary as “ useful knowledge.” Tis domain is as wide as nature itself,
and he best fulfills his mission when he leaves to others the task of
applying the knowledge he gives to the world.

We have here the explanation of the well-known fact that the
functions of ‘the investigator of the laws of nature and of the
inventor who applies these laws to utilitarian purposes are rarely
united in the same person. If the one conspicuous exception which
the past century presents to this rule is not unique, we should prob-
ably have to go back to Watt to find another.

From this viewpoint it is clear that the primary agent in the niove-
ment which has elevated man to the masterful position he now occu-
pies is the scientific investigator. He it is whose work has deprived
plague and pestilence of their terrors, alleviated human suffering,
girdled the earth with the electric wire, bound the continent with the
iron way, and made neighbors of the most distant nations. As the first
agent which has made possible this meeting of his representatives,
let his evolution be this day our worthy theme. As we follow the
evolution of an organism by studying the stages of its growth, so we
have to show how the work of the scientific investigator is related to
the ineffectual efforts of his predecessors.

In our time we think of the process of development in nature as one
going continuously forward through the combination of the opposite
processes of evolution and dissolution. The tendency of our thought
has been in the direction of banishing cataclysms to the theological
limbo and viewing nature as a sleepless plodder, endowed with in-
finite patience, waiting through long ages for results. I do not con-
test the truth of the principle of continuity on which this view is
based. But it fails to make known to us the whole truth. The
building of a ship from the time that her keel is laid until she is making

her way across the ocean is a slow and gradual process; yet there is
‘ataclysmic epoch opening up a new era in her history. It is the mo-
ment when, after lying for months or years a dead, inert, immovable
mass, she is suddenly erdowed with the power of motion, and, as if
imbued with life, glides into the stream, eager to begin the career for
which she was designed.

I think it is thus in the development of humanity. Long ages may
pass during which a race, to all external observation, appears to be
making no real progress. Additions may be made to learning and the
records of history may constantly grow, but there is nothing in its
sphere of thought or in the features of its life that can be called
essentially new. Yet nature may have been all along slowly working
in a way which evades our scrutiny until the result of her operations
suddenly appears in a new and revolutionary movement, carrying the
race to a higher plane of civilization.

It is not difficult to peimt out such epochs in human progress. The
greatest of all, because it was the first, is one of which we find no rec-
ord either in written or geological history. It was the epoch when
our progenitors first took conscious thought of the morrow, first used
the crude weapons which nature had placed within their reach to kill
their prey, first built a fire to warm their bodies and cook their food.
I love to fancy that there was some one first man, the Adam of evolu-
tion. who did all this, and who used the power thus acquired to show
his fellows how they might profit by his example. When the members
of the tribe or community which he gathered around him began to
conceive of life as a whole—to include yesterday, to-day, and _ to-
morrow in the same mental grasp—to think how they might apply
the gifts of nature to their own uses, a movement was begun which
should ultimately lead to civilization.

Long indeed must have been the ages required for the development
of this rudest primitive community into the civilization revealed
to us by the most ancient tablets of Egypt and Assyria. After
spoken language was developed, and after the rude representation
of ideas by visible marks drawn to resemble them had long been
practiced, some Cadmus must have invented an alphabet. When
the use of written language was thus introduced, the word of com-
mand ceased to be confined to the range of the human voice, and it
became possible for master minds to extend their influence as far

as a written message could be carried. Then were communities
gathered into provinces, provinces into kingdoms, kingdoms into
the great empires of antiquity. Then arose a stage of civilization
which we find pictured in the most ancient records

a stage in
which men were governed by laws that were perhaps as wisely
adapted to their conditions as our laws are to ours—in which the

phenomena of nature were rudely observed, and striking occurrences
in the earth or in the heayens recorded in the annals of the nation.

Vast was the progress of knowledge during the interval between
these empires and the century in which modern science began. Yet,
if Tam right in making a distinction between the slow and regular
steps of progress, each growing naturally out of that which pre-
ceded it, and the entrance of the mind at some fairly definite epoch
into an entirely new sphere of activity, it would appear that there
was only one such epoch during the entire interval. This was when
abstract geometrical reasoning commenced, and astronomical observa-
tions alming at precision were recorded, compared, and discussed.
Closely associated with it must have been the construction of the
forms of logic. The radical difference between the demonstration
of a theorem of geometry and the reasoning of everyday life which
the masses of men must have practiced from the beginning, and
which few even to-day ever get beyond, is so evident at a glance
that I need not dwell upon it. The principal feature of this ad-
vance is that, by one of those antinomies of the human intellect of
which examples are not wanting even in our time, the develop-
ment of abstract ideas preceded the concrete knowledge — of
natural phenomena. When we reflect that in the geometry of
Euclid the science of space was brought to such logical perfection
that even to-day its teachers are not agreed as to the practicability
of any great improvement upon it, we can not avoid the feeling that
a very sheht change in the direction of the intellectual activity of
the Greeks would have led to the beginning of natural science. But
it would seem that the very purity and perfection which was aimed
at in their system of geometry stood in the way of any extension or
application of its methods and spirit to the field of nature. One
example of this is worthy of attention. In modern teaching the
idea of magnitude as generated by motion is freely introduced. A
line is described by a moving point; a plane by a moving line; a
sohd by a moving plane. It may, at first sight, seem singular that
this conception finds no place in the Euclidian system. But we may
regard the omission as a mark of logical purity and rigor. Had the
real or supposed advantages of introducing motion into geometrical
conceptions been suggested to Euclid, we may suppose him to have
replied that the theorems of space are independent of time; that the
idea of motion necessarily implies time, and that, in consequence, to
avail ourselves of it would be to introduce an extraneous element into
geometry.

It is quite possible that the contempt of the ancient philosophers
for the practical application of their science, which has continued
in some form to our own time, and which is not altogether unwhole-

sm 1904——15

.
226 EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR.

some, was a powerful factor in the same direction. The result was
that, in keeping geometry pure from ideas which did not belong to
it. it failed to form what might otherwise have been the basis of
physical science. Its founders missed the discovery that methods
similar to those of geometric demonstration could be extended into
other and wider fields than that of space. Thus, not only the devel-
opment of applhed geometry, but the reduction of other conceptions
to a rigorous mathematical form: was indefinitely postponed.

Astronomy 1s necessarily a science of observation pure and simple,
in which experiment can have no place except as an auxillary. The
vague accounts of striking celestial phenomena handed down by the
priests and astrologers of antiquity were followed in the time of the
Greeks by observations having, in form at least, a rude approach to
precision, though nothing lke the degree of precision that the as-
tronomer of to-day would reach with the naked eye, aided by such
instruments as he could fashion from the tools at the command of the
ancients.

The rude observations commenced by the Babylonians were con-
tinued with gradually improving instruments—first by the Greeks
and afterwards by the Arabs—but the results failed to afford any
insight into the true relation of the earth to the heavens. What
was most remarkable in this failure is that, to take a first step for-
ward which would have led on to success, no more was necessary
than a course of abstract thinking vastly easier than that required
for working out the problems of geometry. That space is infinite is
an unexpressed axiom, tacitly assumed by Euclid and his successors.
Combining this with the most elementary consideration of the prop-
erties of the triangle, it would be seen that a body of any given size
could be placed at such a distance in space as to appear to us lke a
point. Hence, a body as large as our earth, which was known to be
a globe from the time that the ancient Phoenicians navigated the
Mediterranean, if placed in the heavens at a sufficient distance,
would look like a star. The obvious conclusion that the stars might
be bodies like our globe, shining either by their own hght or by that
of the sun, would have been a first step to the understanding of the
true system of the world.

There is historic evidence that this deduction did not wholly es-
cape the Greek thinkers. It is true that the critical student will
assign little weight to the current belief that the vague theory of
Pythagoras—that fire was at the center of all things—implies a con-
ception of the heliocentric theory of the solar system. But the testi-
mony of Archimedes, confused though it is in form, leaves no serious
doubt that Aristarchus of Samos not only propounded the view that
the earth revolves both on its own axis and around the sun, but that
he correctly removed the great stumbling-block in the way of this
bo

EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR. 227
theory by adding that the distance of the fixed stars was infinitely
greater than the dimensions of the earth’s orbit. Even the world of
philosophy was not yet reacy for this conception, and, so far from
seeing the reasonableness of the explanation, we find Ptolemy argu-
ing against the rotation of the earth on grounds which careful ob-
servations of the phenomena around him would have shown to be ill-
founded.

Physical science, if we can apply that term to an unco-ordinated
body of facts, was successfully cultivated from the earhest times.
Something must have been known of the properties of metals, and
the art of extracting them from their ores must have been practiced
from the time that coins and medals were first stamped. The prop-
erties of the most common compounds were discovered by alchemists
in their vain search for the philosopher’s stone, but no actual progress
worthy of the name rewarded the practitioners of the black art.

Perhaps the first approach to a correct method was that of Archi-
medes, who by much thinking worked out the law of the lever,
reached the conception of the center of gravity, and demonstrated
the first principles of hydrostatics. It is remarkable that he did not
extend his researches into the phenomena of motion, whether sponta-
neous or produced by force. The stationary condition of the human
intellect is most strikingly illustrated by the fact that not until the
time of Leonardo was any substantial advance made on his discovery.
To sum up in one sentence the most characteristic feature of ancient
and medieval science, we see a notable contrast between the precision
of thought implied in the construction and demonstration of geomet-
rical theorems and the vague indefinite character of the ideas of
natural phenomena generally, a contrast which did not disappear
until the foundations of modern science began to be laid.

We should miss the most essential point of the difference between
medivval and modern learning if we looked upon it as mainly a dif-
ference either in the precision or the amount of knowledge. The
development of both of these qualities would, under any cireum-
stances, have been slow and gradual, but sure. We can hardly sup-
pose that any one generation, or even any one century, would have
seen the complete substitution of exact for inexact ideas. Slowness
of growth is as inevitable in the case of knowledge as in that of a
growing organism. The most essential point of difference is one of
those seemingly slight ones, the importance of which we are too apt
to overlook. It was hke the drop of blood in the wrong place, which
some one has told us makes all the difference between a philosopher
and a maniac. It was all the difference between a living tree and a
dead one, between an inert mass and a growing organism. The tran.
sition of knowledge from the dead to the living form must, in any
complete review of the subject, be looked upon as the really great
2238 EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR.

event of modern times. Before this event the intellect was bound down
by a scholasticism which regarded knowledge as a rounded whole,
the parts of which were written in books and carried in the minds of
learned men. The student was taught from the beginning of his
work to look upon authority as the foundation of his beliefs. The
older the authority the greater the weight it carried. So effective
was this teaching that it seems never to have occurred to individual
men that they had all the opportunities ever enjoyed by Aristotle of
discovering truth, with the added advantage of all his knowledge to
begin with. Advanced as was the development of formal logic, that
practical logic was wanting which could see that the last of a series
of authorities, every one of which rested on those which preceded it,
could never form a surer foundation for any doctrine than that sup-
pled by its original propounder.

The result of this view of knowledge was, that although during
the fifteen centuries following the death of the geometer of Syracuse
great universities were founded at which generations of professors
expounded all the learning of their time, neither professor nor student
ever suspected what latent possibilities of good were concealed in the
most familar operations of nature. Everyone felt the wind blow,
saw water boil, and heard the thunder crash, but never thought of
investigating the forces here at play. Up to the middle of the
iifteenth century the most acute observer could scarcely have seen
the dawn of a new era.

In view of this state of things, it must be regarded as one of the
most remarkable facts in evolutionary history that four or five men,
whose mental constitution was either typical of the new order of
things or who were powerful agents in bringing it about, were all
born during the fifteenth century, four of them at least at so nearly
the same time as to be contemporaries.

Leonardo da Vinci, whose artistic genius has charmed succeeding
generations, was also the first practical engineer of his time, and the
first man after Archimedes to make a substantial advance in develop-
ing the laws of motion. That the world was not prepared to make
use of his scientific discoveries does not detract from the significance
which must attach to the period of his birth.

Shortly after him was born the great navigator whose bold spirit

was to make known a new world, thus giving to commercial enter-
prise that impetus which was so powerful an agent in bringing about
a revolution in the thoughts of men.

The birth of Columbus was soon followed by that of Copernicus,
the first after Aristarchus to demonstrate the true system of the
world. In him more than in any of his contemporaries do we see the
struggle between the old forms of thought and the new. It seems
almost pathetic, and is certainly most suggestive of the general view
EVOLUTION OF THE SCTENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR. 229

of knowledge taken at that time, that instead of claiming credit for
bringing to light greatetruths before unknown he made a labored
attempt to show that after all there was nothing really new in his
system, which he claimed to date from Pythagoras and Philolaus.
In this connection it is curious that he makes no mention of Aris-
tarchus, who, I think, will be regarded by conservative historians
as his only demonstrated predecessor. To the hold of the older ideas
upon his mind we must attribute the fact that in constructing his
system he took great pains to make as little change as possible in
ancient conceptions.

Luther, the greatest thought stirrer of them all, practically of the
same generation with Copernicus, Leonardo, and Columbus, does not
come in as a scientific investigator, but as the great loosener of chains
which had so fettered the intellect of men that they dared not think
otherwise than as the authorities thought.

Almost coeval with the advent of these intellects was the invention
of printing with movable type. Gutenberg was born during the first
decade of the century, and his associates and others credited wiih
the invention not many years afterwards. If we accept the principle
on which IT am basing my argument, that we should assign the first
place to the birth of those psychic agencies which started men on new
lines of thought, then surely was the fifteenth the wonderful century.

Let us not forget that, in assigning the actors then born to their
places, we are not narrating history, but studying a special phase
of evolution. It matters not for us that no university imvited Leo-
nardo to its halls, and that his science was valued by his contempo-
raries only as an adjunct to the art of engineering. The great fact
still is that he was the first of mankind to propound Jaws of motion.
It is not for anything in Luther’s doctrines that he finds a place in
our scheme. No matter for us whether they were sound or not.
What he did toward the evolution of the scientific investigator was
to show by his example that a man might question the best-estab-
lished and most venerable authority and still live, still preserve his
intellectual imtegrity, still command a hearing from nations and
their rulers. It matters not for us whether Columbus ever knew
that he had discovered a new continent. His work was to teach
that neither hydra, chimera, nor abyss—neither divine injunction nor
infernal machination—was in the way of men visiting every part of
the globe, and that the problem of conquering the world reduced itself
to one of sails and rigging, hull and compass. The better part of
Copernicus was to direct man to a view point whence he should see
that the heavens were of ke matter with the earth. All this done,
the acorn was planted from which the oak of our civilization should
spring. The mad quest for gold which followed the discovery of
Columbus, the questionings which absorbed the attention of the
930 EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR.

learned, the indignation excited by the seeming vagaries of a Par-
celsus, the fear and trembling lest the strange doctrine of Copernicus
should undermine the faith of centuries, were all helps to the germi-
nation of the seed—stimuli to thought which urged it on to explore
the new fields opened up to its occupation. This given, all that has
since followed came out in regular erder of development, and need
be here considered only in those phases having a special relation to
the purpose of our present meeting.

So slow was the growth at first that the sixteenth century mav
scarcely have recognized the inauguration of a new era. Torricelli
and Benedetti were of the third generation after Leonardo, and
Galileo, the first to make a substantial advance upon his theory, was
born more than a century after him. Only two or three men ap-
peared in a generation who, working alone, could make real progress
in discovery, and even these could do little in leavening the minds
of their fellow-men with the new ideas.

Up to the middle of the seventeenth century an a
experience since that time shows to be necessary to the most pro-
ductive intellectual activity was wanting. This was the attrition of

gent which all

e

like minds, making suggestions to each other, criticising, comparing,
and reasoning. This element was introduced by the organization
of the Royal Society of London and the Academy cf Sciences of Paris.

The members of these two bodies seem like ingenious youth sud-
denly thrown into a new world of interesting objects, the purposes
and relations of which they had to discover. The novelty of the situ-
ation 1s strikingly shown in the questions which occupied the minds of
the incipient investigators. One natural result of British maritime
enterprise was that the aspirations of the Fellows of the Royal
Society were not confined to any continent or hemisphere. Inquiries
were sent all the way to Batavia to know “ whether there be a hill
in Sumatra which burneth continually and a fountain which runneth
pure balsam.” The astronomical precision with which it seemed
possible that physiological operations might go on was evinced by
the inquiry whether the Indians can so prepare that stupefying herb
Datura that “ they make it le several days, months, years, according
as they will, in a man’s body without doing him any harm, and at the
end kill him without.missing an hour’s time.” Of this continent one of
the inquiries was whether there be a tree in Mexico that yields water,
wine, vinegar, milk, honey, wax, thread, and needle.

Among the problems before the Paris Academy of Sciences those
of physiology and biology took a prominent place. The distillation
of compounds had long been practiced, and the fact that the more
spirituous elements of certain substances were thus separated natu-
rally led to the question whether the essential essences of life might not
be discoverable in the same way. In order that all might participate
EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR. 931

in the experiments they were conducted in open session of the
academy, thus guarding against the danger of any one member ob-
taining for his exclusive personal use a possible elixer of life. A
wide range of the animal and vegetable kingdom, including cats,
dogs, and birds of various species, were thus analyzed. The practice
of dissection was introduced on a large scale. That of the cadaver
of an elephant occupied several sessions, and was of such interest that
the monarch himself was a spectator.

To the same epoch with the formation and first work of these two
bodies belongs the invention of a mathematical method which in its
importance to the advance of exact science may be classed with the
invention of the alphabet in its relation to the progress of society
at large. The use of algebraic symbols to represent quantities had
its origin before the commencement of the new era, and gradually
grew into a highly developed form during the first two centuries
of thatera. But this method could represent quantities only as xed.
ft is true that the elasticity inherent in the use of such symbols per-
mitted of their being apphed to any and every quantity; yet, in any
one application, the quantity was considered as fixed and definite.
But most of the magnitudes of nature are ina state of continual vari-
ation; indeed, since all motion is variation, the latter is a universal
characteristic of all phenomena. No serious advance could be made
in the application of algebraic language to the expression of physical
phenomena until it could be so extended as to express variation in
quantities, as well as the quantities themselves. This extension,
worked out independently by Newton and Leibnitz, may be classed
as the most fruitful of conceptions in exact science. With it the way
was opened for the unimpeded and continually accelerated progress
of the two last centuries.

The feature of this period which has the closest relation to the
purpose of our coming together is the seemingly unending sub-
division of knowledge into specialties, many of which are becoming
so minute and so isolated that they seem to have no interest for any
but their few pursuers. Happily science itself has afforded a cor-
rective for its own tendency in this direction. The careful thinker
will see that in these seemingly diverging branches common elements
and common principles are coming more and more to light. There
is an imcreasing recognition of methods of research and of deduction
which are common to large branches or to the whole of science. We
are more and more recognizing the principle that progress in knowl-
edge implies its reduction to more exact forms, and the expression
of its ideas in language more or less mathematical. The problem
before the organizers of this congress was, therefore, to. bring the
sciences together and seek for the tmity which we believe underlies
their infinite diversity.

.
232 EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR.

The assembling of such a body as now fills this hall was scarcely
possible in any preceding generation, and is made possible now only
through the agency of science itself. It ditfers from all preceding
international meetings by the universality of its scope, which aims
to include the whole of knowledge. It is also unique in that none
out leaders have been sought out as members. It is unique in that so
many lands have delegated their choicest intellects to carry on its
work. They come from the country to which our Republic is indebted
for a third of its territory, including the ground on which we stand;
from the land which has taught us that the most scholarly devotion
io the languages and learning of the cloistered past is compatible
with leadership in the practical appheation of modern science to the
arts of life; from the island whose language and literature have
found a new field and a vigorous growth in this region; from the
last seat of the holy Roman Empire; from the country which, re-
membering a monarch who made an astronomical observation at the
Greenwich Observatory, has enthroned science in one of the highest
places in its government; from the peninsula so learned that we
have invited one of its scholars to come and tell us of our own
language; from the land which gave birth to Leonardo, Galileo,
Torricelli, Columbus, Volta—what an array or immortal names !—
from the little republic of glorious history which, breeding men
rugged as its eternal snow peaks, has yet been the seat of scientific

investigation since the day of the Bernoullis; from the land whose
heroic dwellers did not hesitate to use the ocean itself to protect it
against invaders, and which now makes us marvel at the amount of
erudition compressed within its little area; from the nation across
the Pacific, which by half a century of unequaled progress in the
arts of life has made an important contribution to evolutionary sci-
ence through demonstrating the falsity of the theory that the most
ancient races are doomed to be left in the rear of the advancing age
in a word, from every great center of intellectual activity on the

globe I see before me eminent representatives of that world advance
in knowledge which we have met to celebrate. May we not confi-
dently hope that the discussions of such an assemblage will prove
pregnant of a future for science which shall outshine even its bril-
lant past ¢

Gentlemen and scholars all, vou do not visit our shores to find
great collections in which centuries of humanity have given expres-
sion on canvas and in marble to their hopes, fears, and aspirations.
Nor do you expect institutions and buildings hoary with age. But
as you feel the vigor latent in the fresh air of these expansive prai-
ries, which has collected the products of human genius by which we
are here surrounded, and, I may add, brought us together; as you
study the institutions which we have founded for the benefit not only
EVOLUTION OF THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATOR. 233

of our own people, but of humanity at large; as you meet the men
who, in the short space of one century, have transformed this valley
from a savage wilderness into what it is to-day, then may you find
compensation for the‘ want of a past like yours by seeing with
prophetic eye a future world power of which this region shall be the
seat. If such is to be the outcome of the institutions which we are
now building up, then may your present visit be a blessing both to
your posterity and ours by making that power one for good to all
mankind. Your deliberations will help to demonstrate to us and
to the world at large that the reign of law must supplant that of
brute force in the relations of the nations, just as it has supplanted
it in the relations of individuals. You will help to show that the
war which science is now waging against the sources of diseases,
pain, and misery offers an even nobler field for the exercise of heroic
qualities than can that of battle. We hope that when, after your
all too fleeting sojourn in our midst, you return to your own shores
you will long feel the influence of the new air you have breathed
in an infusion of increased vigor in pursuing your varied labors.
And if a new impetus is thus given to the great intellectual move-
ment of the past century, resulting not only in promoting the unifica-
tion of knowledge, but in widening its field through new combina-
tions of effort on the part of its votaries, the projectors, organizers,
and supporters of this Congress of Arts and Science will be justified
of their labors.

METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

By ALFRED DITTE,
ember of the Institute of France, Professor of Mineral Chentistry at the
Sorbonne.

The earth’s atmosphere contains an enormous quantity of dust,
particles of which float in the air for varying periods of time. This
dust is everywhere, in the fields as well as in town, and #1e only
reason we do not see it continually is because the particles do not
reflect enough hght to make an impression on the retina. A ray of
sunshine ina dark room reveals the presence of innumerable particles.

Any polished surface exposed to the air will soon be covered with
an atmospheric sediment. All terrestrial substances, especially
metals, may by mechanical action be reduced to a fine powder, light
enough to be carried by the wind and held suspended in the air. The
beating of the waves against the shore makes a powder, and the
water in evaporating leaves a little saline residue in the air. One
‘an imagine without much difficulty, but not without a certain disgust,
the character of the dust particles found in city air; they form a
means of contact between persons widely separated, and to this contact
is due much of the disease common among great aggregations of
people. Some of these innumerable corpuscles are bound to be germs
of fermentations, of putrefactions, and of various alterations of the
blood in epidemic cliseases.

Not only are all these solid substances visible with sufficient light,
but they may without great difficulty be collected for purposes of
study. Pasteur was the first to devise a method of so doing by draw-
ing the air through a tube containing a wad of nitrated cotton. When
a sufficient quantity of air has been run through the air filter the
cotton, with its deposit of dust, is treated with ether, which dissolves
it, leaving a residue of dust particles. The insoluble bits of dust are
collected by decantation, washed and dried, and then examined under
a microscope.

236 METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

In this residue may be distinguished corpuscles of organic matter,
with which we are not now concerned, and also mineral substances,
which we will examine more particularly. Tiny as these bodies are,
it is possible to measure them with a finely graduated micrometer, and
it has been found that in diameter they ordinarily measure between
one one-hundredth and one -one-thousandth of a millimeter.

It is also possible to obtain an approximate idea of the quantity of
these dust particles by drawing with an air pump a determined amount
of air, bubble by bubble, through a tube containing a little pure water
and then through a wad of nitrated cotton. The particles which have
been retained by the water are secured by evaporation and united
with those obtained by the dissolution in ether of the guncotton.
By this method there have been found at Paris, during normal
atmospheric conditions, from 6 to 8 mg. of dust to the cubic meter
of air; after a day’s rainfall, 6 mg.; after a drought of eight days,
23mg. Naturally the quantity in country air is much smaller. These
figures represent the total weight of all solid particles, mineral and
organic; if the latter be eliminated by calcination in a current of air
the cinders representing mineral matter will be found to vary from
66 to 75 per cent of the whole weight. In the residue are found
cinders of salts soluble in water, of matter soluble im hydrochloric
acid, and of substances which can not be dissolved either in water or
in acid.

The particles floating in the air are held there only by atmospheric
agitation, the most minute bemg held longest in suspense. It may
well be asked how bodies of this kind, so much heavier than the air,
ean be held in the atmosphere. Circulation will show that grains of
mineral as small as 0.01 mm. in diameter can nevertheless fall with
considerable rapidity, 0.66 m. a second in the case of a gram of silica.
It can easily be seen that a sphere of 2.5 density, 1 m. im diam-
eter, would fall at a speed of 220 m. a second, if the fall were
uniform and through air of ordinary density. The theoretical
velocity of a corpuscle of d dimensions would therefore equal J 220d.
But in reality this is greatly modified in bodies of minute dimensions
by the agitation and continual movement of the air, which fact
accounts for the suspension of the atmospheric particles. They do,
however, fall gradually, and are continually forming on the earth’s
surface a sediment that can easily be collected by stretching on a
frame a sheet of paper treated with gelatin and placing the con-
trivance on an isolated roof 10 to 15 m. from the ground. Or a dust
table, about a meter square, lined with thin sheet tin and turning on
an axis so as always to face the wind, can be used with equal success.
The wind passing over its surface constantly lets fall a portion of
the dust it carries, and this deposit is afterwards collected with a flat
hair brush. The quantity of dust varies with the velocity of the
METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE. 237

wind and the humidity of the atmosphere, also with the season of the
year and the state of the sun.

In Paris between 2 and 9 mg. of dust are collected on a square
meter of surface in twenty-four hours. Taking 4 mg. as the mean,
this corresponds to a daily deposition on a surface equal to that of
the Champs de Mars (about 500,000 m*) of 2 kilos (44 pounds)
of corpuscles. An estimate made by forcing air through water and
evaporating shows a weight of 6 to 23 mg. to a cubic meter of air.
Taking in this case 6 mg. as the mean and considering a sheet of air,
say, 5m. in thickness, there would be almost 15 kilos (83 pounds) of
dust man area equal im extent to the Champs de Mars and a weight
of several hundred kilos in air overhanging Paris. In the fields
the quantity of dust collected is considerably smaller. It is hardly
necessary to say that this sediment does not remain long in the place
where it fal!s, but 1s quickly carried off again by the wind. However,
the figures given will indicate in a slight measure the importance and
extent of this aerial transportation of solid matter.

High buildings act as veritable dust traps. For instance, in a
tower of Notre Dame Cathedral which no one had entered for sev-
eral years, the wind, passing through the narrow windows 60 m. from
the ground, had deposited a bed at least a millimeter in thickness of
fine grayish dust. Analysis showed that this was of the same com-
position as the atmospheric dust. 1. e., about 32 per cent organic mat-
ter and 67 per cent of cinders. Of this inorganic matter, 9 per cent
was soluble in water, 24 per cent in hydrochloric acid, and the remain-
ing 34 per cent consisted of a residue essentially silicate. Various
analyses of dust accumulated in uninhabited portions of lofty struc-
tures showed very similar results; the dimensions of the particles
were invariably compassed between 0.01 and 0.001 mm., and the
cinders always represented about 75 per cent of all the matter
collected.

Another method of investigating the solid bodies in the atmosphere
is by making an analysis of meteoric water. Rain is always charged
with a sediment collected in the air, which may be extracted by
filtering and evaporation. It can be advantageously collected in a
receptacle made of a series of porcelain plates, built up on three
sides only and arranged on a frame lke tiles on a roof. If this
apparatus be of sufficient size considerable quantities of water will
glide over the plaques and through a funnel into a large flask. Porce-
lain is much better than glass for this purpose, as the latter is likely
to be attacked by the carbonic acid and ammonia in standing rain
water.

The weight of the residue extracted from a liter of water varies
considerably. At the observatory of St. Marie du Mont (Manche)

on June 1, 10, and 11, 1876, amounted to from 23 to 75 mg. per liter;
at Paris it has run from 23 to 172, the maximum being 421 mg. This
residue is blackish gray, except that collected in the fields, which is
entirely white, and it invariably contains the same relative propor-
tions of mineral substances and organic matter.

The size of snowflakes and the leisurely manner in which these
little spongy masses fall through the air makes them even better
fitted than rain drops to seize in their passage all the dust particles
and solid bodies floating in the atmosphere. Moreover, solids are col-
lected in the waters fused into the flake. Consequently, when Mon-
sieur Tissandier collected with all proper precaution the first snows
that fell on the towers of Notre Dame in the winter of 1875, he found
in each liter of the snow water a body of corpuscles varying in weight
from 56 to 118 mg. <A liter of melted snow collected under the same
conditions in the country contains from 48 to 104 mg. Further-
more, as one might suppose, the corpuscles are less numerous after a
prolonged snowstorm, so much so that in Paris, after a heavy fall,
only 16 to 24 mg were found. ‘The residue obtaimed by the evapora-
tion of melted snow is ordinarily an impalpable grayish powder, con-
taining, at Paris, about 57 per cent of cinders, and in the country
about 61 per cent.

Hail, because of its small size and its great density, does not collect
the dust particles so easily. Nevertheless, it has been collected and
examined in the same way.

Zvon.—The examination of the cinders in the dust collected in these
various ways enables us to recognize in our atmosphere the presence
of a number of metals, the most important of which is iron.

When a strong magnet was held near some of the atmospheric sedi-
ment thus obtained, a portion of the corpuscles adhered to it and were
brushed off for microscopic or chemical examinations. It was then
discovered that these bits are made up essentially of iron. The same
results were obtained with sediments collected in several very differ-
ent localities. The examinations even went so far as to estimate ap-
proximately the quantity of iron contained in this magnetic residue
by the intensity of the coloration of sulphocyanide of potassium in the
dissolution of a known quantity of dust. These ferruginous particles
were found to be either pure iron or that metal associated in certain
proportions with other elements, such as nickel and phosphorus. M.
Nordenskidld, at Stockholm in 1871, examining the surface of the
greatest fall of snow within the memory of man, found smal! quanti-
ties of metallic iron. But fearing this might have come from neigh-
boring roofs, he had his brother examine the snow in a desolate plain
surrounded by the forests of Finland. The black powder secured
there was of the same character as that of Stockholm. The particles
of iron drawn out by a magnet, when triturated in an agate mortar,

were recognized as forms of the metal exactly analogous to those
found in the snow ‘at Stockholm and other parts of Sweden. Fur-
thermore, there was-collected on the floating ice off Spitzbergen a
gray powder containing little magnetic grains of iron coated with
iron oxides. |

In examining some carbonaceous dust collected in 1870 on the snow
and ice of the Inlandis elacier, a sea of ice in Greenland, at 80° north
latitude, there was found ferruginous corpuscles in which was deter-
mined the presence of nickel and cobalt. M. Jung has verified these
observations by his researches on the snows of Geneva. He noted the
presence of iron in the storm of 1883 at Geneva, on the Saléve, and on
the Great St. Bernard Pass, at an altitude of 8,100 feet. On the
surtace of the great snow fields covering this lofty region he dis-
covered a very fine blackish powder containing the characteristic
globules and irregular fragments susceptible to the magnet. The
evaporation of 15 liters of water from melting this snow gave M.
Jung a residue formed of the same particles, which, treated with hy-
drochloric acid, made a solution with a strong iron reaction. The
insignificant weight of the matter collected made it impossible for
him to establish clearly the presence of nickel or cobalt. M. Norden-
skiGld likewise observed some dust which fell at an altitude of 9,850
feet, near San Fernande, Chili, in November, 1883. The Cordilleras,
which had been white with fresh snow, were covered in the space of
half an hour with a sheet of red, composed principally of minute fer-
ruginous particles, hard but shiehtly malleable.

In this powder, which did not contain metallic iron, were found
reddish-brown globular grains soluble in hydrochloric acid and
brownish-white grains insoluble in that acid and made up of a silicate-
like feldspar. The first named was composed of oxide of iron, 74.60;
oxide of nickel with traces of cobalt, 6.015 silica, 7.60; magnesia, 3.88 ;
with small quantities of phosphoric acid, aluminum, chalk, and traces
of copper. The richness of the material in iron, nickel, magnesia,
and phosphoric acid is remarkable. In contrast to this discovery.
M. Tissancier, experimenting with rain waters collected at St. Marie
du Mont (Manche), was able to obtain 124 milligrams of  cor-
puscles susceptible to magnetic influence, which, under the action of
hydrochloric acid, left only an insignificant residue of sillica, and
found a solution in which ammonia precipitated an abundance of
iron oxide, sulphoevanide of potassium gave an intense clear color,
and even the yellow prussiate of potash a deposit of Prussian blue.
The liquor separated from the iron gave with ammonium sulphide a
hight-black precipitate of sulphide of nickel, forming with borax lead
its characteristic pearl-violet color and turning to a brownish gray on
cooling. M. Jung also collected snow at different altitudes—at 1,225
feet at Montreux on the border of Lake Geneva; 3,300 feet at the

station des Avants below the Moutiers; at 8,100 feet at the hospice of
the Great St. Bernard—and compared the evaporation residue from
this snow with the dust collected in the towers of several cathedrals
at Paris, Geneva, Lausanne, Varsovie, and at Samara on the Volga.
He concluded that iron is as surely present in recent snows as in the
dust of centuries accumulated in the clock towers of the old churches.
In all cases the appearance of this metal indicated that it had been
subjected to high temperatures.

These corpuscles, found always in greater quantities in the snows of
lower altitudes than from higher regions, do not always have the same
characteristics, and students of them have classified them into several
groups:

1. Irregular amorphous grayish fragments, measuring from 0.1 to
0.2 mm. in diameter.

2. Mammilated particles, black and opaque, much smaller, measur-
ing only 0.01 to 0.05 mm.

3. Fibrous particles of about the same size.

4. Spherical corpuscles, black and opaque, diameter 0.01 to 0.02
mm.

5. Corpuscles apparently with a tiny vase-like neck.

Moreover, these minute ferruginous corpuscles divide into two
classes, some which have been deposited on the surface of the earth,
others of an extra-terrestrial origin. The effects of showers of
meteors are shown in an incontestable manner. Ehrenberg, Arago,
(Juetelet, Daubrée, and Nordenskidld have brought forward a great
number of facts in this connection. Examining a fine dust which on
the 25th of January, 1859, fell in the Indian Ocean, covering the
decks of the good ship Josiah Bates, Ehrenberg showed that this
powder, which to the naked eye appeared to be only little agglom-
erate grains, was in reality formed by drops composed of metallic
iron and iron oxide solidified and creased in a manner analogous to
that of the Batavian tears. He considered this proof that a mass of
meteoric iron is made incandescent by the friction of the air. Sedi-
ments of this sort may come from the superficial fusion of meteorites,
or, as Daubrée has indicated in his memoir on the meteorite of
Orgueil,* they may be simply the result of disintegration.

The dust is so friable that some bits were reduced to a powder by
the pressure of the fingers. Its different parts are cemented together
with some alkaline salts so soluble in water that this liquid will
work a complete disintegration into a fine powder that will pass
through the hardest filters. Numerous cases of rains of fire which
should apparently be attributed to the fall of incandescent débris of
meteorites are familiar. The Baron de Reichenbach insisted strongly

« Journal des Savants, 1870.
METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE. 241

on a granular formation of meteorites, which can exist as well as
an impalpable powder fleating in space as in the forms of conglom-
crates of several hundred kilos weight. Very small grains which,
in passing through the atmosphere, were heated, melted, and vola-
tilized, appear to us in the form of shooting stars; it 1s supposed
that matter, not over a gram in weight, is sufficient to produce one
of these meteors. Searching for the dust of shooting stars, de
Reichenbach found, in 1864, on the summit of mountains of Germany
some ferruginous dust giving nickel and cobalt reactions. On the
hill of Labisberg, at an altitude of 1,300 feet, under the shelter of
the beech forests, untouched by ax or pick, he found similar traces
of nickel and cobalt. Again, in a note of March 4, 1812, Von Baum-
haver published some observations on magnetic particles obtained
from hailstones, citing particularly a hail storm he observed at
Padua on the 26th of August, 1834. After this meteoric period
of August and September Phipson managed to collect sone black
angular particles which were neither carbonaceous nor coated with
soot, and which, dissolved in hydrochloric acid, formed a perchlo-
ride of iron. Nordenskidld encountered in the snow collected on
icebergs some metallic particles about a quarter of a millimeter in
circumference containing metalhe iron coated with carbonized oxide
and was at the same time able to determine the presence of nickel
and phosphorus.

After a heavy fall of snow at Geneva on October 5, 1883, M. Jung
melted a quantity collected on the Saléve, and found therein a
deposit of powder exceptionally rich in iron globules.

There fell in 1883, about the annual period in November char-
acterized by an abundance of shooting stars, a rain remarkably
strong in metallic dust of cosmic origin. These particularly abun-
dant globules of iron might have been produced by the breaking
up of much larger meteorites into microscopical shooting stars.
From his Stockholm analysis of snow, in which, as in hail, he found
bits of iron, Nordenskidld satisfied himself that hail is condensed
around minute grains of cosmic matter floating in the air and fall-
ing imperceptibly but continuously to the earth. He regards the
existence of such material as proven by his observations and attrib-
utes to its fall a considerable importance not only from the stand-
point of the geologist and physiographist, but from that of the
farmer; this last on account of its phosphorus, which with nickel and
cobalt is characteristic of meteoric iron. To cite a single example: An
analysis of the meteoric iron found at Santa Catarina, Brazil, gave
the following components: Tron, 63.69 per cent; nickel, 33.97 per
cent; cobalt, 148; with small quantities of phosphorus, sulphur,
earbon, and silica. This iron, remarkable for its exceptional quan-

tity of nickel, is not attacked by the action of air and water. and
Is recognizable by its smooth gray tint.

Nordenski6ld concluded from all these facts that a considerable
number of aérolites constantly enter our atmosphere and are there
broken up, thus giving an extraterrestrial origin to the magnetic
corpuscles of the air.

The little meteoric particles do not, however, always appear in the
form of polished spheres, nor in the characteristic globules. The
iron floating in our atmosphere often appears in irregular black frag-
ments formed by a conjunction of extremely minute granules grouped
in compact masses sometimes with a rough and irregular surface.

The study of hailstones has led to the same conclusions as that of
snow. Ina hailstorm at Stockholm, Nordenskiédld found some black
grains which when ground in an agate mortar produced bits of metal-
he iron. In another case the hailstones had a metallic nucleus in
their center. Everman demonstrated the presence of octahedrons of
iron sulphate in some hail from the Prussian province of Orembourg,
and Pictet recognized the presence of iron in the nucleus of hail-
stones which fell in the Majo Province of Spain. Hail collected at
Padua in 1834 contained magnetic grains of both iron and nickel, a
circumstance which connects them with the aerolites, since a combt-
nation of iron and nickel is a characteristic constituent of meteoric
iron.

The apparent planetary origin of these aerial magnetic particles
may best be verified by a comparison with filings from the surface of
actual aerolites. Experiment has shown that the powder thus ob-
tained and the corpuscles collected in the atmosphere are very similar.
The fragments filed from the black crust adhering to the metal have
the form of irregular little coated spheres. The cosmic particles
obtained by Nordenskiéld showed a striking resemblance to those
extracted with a magnet from the sediment of French rain...

All these observations establish the fact that much of the ferru-
ginous dust found in the atmosphere comes from meteorites. These
metallic masses hurtling through space are broken into fragments,
throwing off incandescent particles of metallic iron. The hghtest of
this débris is carried through the air by atmospheric currents and
falls to the earth in the form of magnetic oxide of iron, more or less
completely fused. The luminous train of shooting stars is due to
combustion of these innumerable particles, resembling somewhat the
sparks thrown off by an iron ribbon burning in oxygen. Meteorites,
as everyone has noticed, often have luminous trains, which are to be
attributed to the incandescent débris detached from the mass.

Thus it appears that ferruginous powder of extraterrestrial origin
is falling constantly to the earth and that a part of the atmospheric
dust comes from planetary space. As Daubrée has brought out in
METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE. 943

his observations on the meteorite of Orgueil, some of these particles
come from the explosiow of meteorites or from their simple disunion
when friable and prone to disintegration. Assuming that their mean
diameter is a constant of 0.01 mm., which, in fact, is a rather too lib-
eral estimate, 1t would take 2,500 of them to cover a square millimeter
and 250,000 to equal in bulk a cubic millimeter. Therefore it 1s easily
appreciated that the deposit of iron on the earth’s surface from this
source even In a considerable interval of time will not be great.

But, admitting that some of the iron dust 1s of extraterrestrial
origin, it is equally true that a large part of it is swept from the
earth’s surface by the wind or carried up in the smoke of the foun-
dries. In the neighborhood of these works may be collected globules
of magnetic iron oxide, which, rising as sparks, took the globular
form in cooling. It is easily shown that bits of iron at high temper-
atures become spherical, and that a mass of it combining at red heat
with oxygen will divide into microscopic globular fragments. When
very fine iron filings are made incandescent by passing through a
hydrogen flame, they burn brilliantly. Tissandier has discovered,
by collecting the products of this combustion on a porcelain plate
and examining them with a microscope, that they are in the form of
spherical globules, vase-necked spheres, irregular surfaced, or fibrous
fragments incompletely fused. Powder obtained by striking a piece
of iron with a flint is made up of the same kind of globules. An iron
wire burning in oxygen will form ‘globules of magnetic oxide visible
to the naked eye and at the same time others much smaller, which
may be collected in water at the bottom of the flask. These are visi-
ble only under great magnification, since their diameter rarely exceeds
0.01 of a millimeter.

The combustion of coal in factories furnishes the air an abundance
of iron oxide from the decomposition of ferruginous pyrites contained
inthe coal. But all these particles obtained in the various ways men-
tioned, whether from the combustion of iron, coal, or other substances,
are easily distinguishable from those of cosmic origin by the fact that
they never contain nickel in any form.

Tilled land and salt water, whence gusts of wind snatch up parti-
cles the more minute of which measure scarcely 0.001 mm., often con-
tains magnetic dusts in comparative abundance. A magnet passed
over their surface attracts tiny grains of magnetic iron oxide. This
is entirely independent of the particles due to the continual destruc-
tion of enormous quantities of iron in manufacturing. The dust
from pulverized magnetic iron ore and other ferruginous minerals,
or the dust formed by oxidation in open air or from fresh or salt
water, never occurs in the mammilated, fibrous, or spherical forms.
There are amorphic grayish powders which do not resemble those
of planetary origin and are very different from those produced at

high temperatures. Tron is also found in semitransparent masses,

containing gran-

But this terrestrial source of ferruginous dusts can not explain the
extraordinary abundance of microscopic particles of iron found in
polar and alpine snows and in rains collected in open country. The
presence of this nickel-bearing iron dust can be explained only as a
powder obtained from the surface of meteorites in the ways we have
shown.

Metals other than tron.—tlt follows, then, that iron is the metal
most abundant in the air, and that in every case when its origin is
extraterrestrial it is associated in variable proportions with nickel
and cobalt; but there are also other metals in the atmosphere. The
analysis of their cinders, as already mentioned, shows that they are
composed of some substances soluble in water, others soluble in hydro-
chloric acid, and some insoluble. The almost white sediments col-
lected in the fields contain about 40 per cent of salts soluble in water,
30 per cent of such matter as calcium and magnesium carbonates,
oxide of iron, and some insoluble substances like silica and clay, with
small quantities of carbon.

An examination of the dust deposited in the towers of Notre Dame
gave 67 per cent mineral matter, 9 per cent of which was soluble in
water, 28 per cent soluble in hydrochloric acid (this decomposing
into 6.1 per cent sesquioxide of iron, 16 per cent calcium carbonate,
and Y.1 per cent magnesium carbonate, with traces of aluminum and
phosphorus), and 34.3 per cent of matter, principally silica, not solu-
ble in the acids. A grayish powder, fine and soft as meal, collected
at Boulogne on October 9, 1576, contained in a dry state, besides 9.7
per cent of organic substances, 55 per cent of silica, 1.8 per cent alumi-
num (with traces of iron), 30.6 per cent calcium carbonate, and 2.5
per cent magnesium carbonate. In the ash calcium, aluminum, mag-
nesium, and other metals were also found.

Besides their two principal components—iron and nickel—meteor-
ites and their débris contain small variable quantities of cobalt, man-
ganese, chrome, tin, magnesium, and aluminum. Some minerals im
particular are contained in these bodies: Schreibersite (phosphide of
iron and nickel), magnetite and chrome iron, which 1s sometimes
found in considerable quantities in the form of tiny grains, and
minute crystals, together with olivine and other silicates. In short,
meteorites may be arranged ina long series, at one extremity of which
are those composed chiefly of iron and nickel and at the other chiefly
nonmetallic mineral substances, as olivine, enstatite, feldspar. amphi-
METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE. 945

bole, pyroxene, variously associated. All of the meteoric minerals
‘an be found in the:dusts of the atmosphere.

Meteors may fall in a direction opposite to that of the earth’s move-
ment, in which case their relative speed, being the sum of the two
movements, will be very great, perhaps 70 km. a second. The resist-,
ance of the air to a flight of such speed produces enough heat to com-
pletely burn and volatilize the matter. If, on the contrary, the move-
ment of the falling mass is In the same direction as that of the earth,
its relative velocity—the difference between the two absolute speeds—
is scarcely 16 km. a second. In this case the heat developed is sufli-
cient only to fuse the mass and vitrify its surface, then perhaps to
break it in such a way as to form a meteorite or aerolite. It is not
sufficient to make a shooting star with its great train of fiery particles.
Consequently, in coming into the earth’s atmosphere, aerolites, whether
big or little, encounter a friction that generates heat and incandes-
cence, consequently combustion, fusion, volatilization: condensation
of the volatilized particles follows, and the dissemination of these con-
densed particles. Thus it is easy to understand how meteorites bring
into the atmosphere various metals, free or in combination, and why
metalliferous minerals. in corpuscles so minute that it Is impossible
to separate and identify them, may be found in the air entirely inde-
pendent of the pulverized minerals raised from the earth’s surface.

Matter soluble in water.—As already mentioned, the * cinders ” of
atmospheric sediments, when treated with water, always yield a cer-
tain amount of soluble salts. These are chlorates, alkaline sulphates,
or calcium sulphate, and nitrates, particularly that of ammonium.

Ammonium nitrate-—A drop of rain allowed to evaporate spon-
taneously on a bit of glass leaves crystals of various shapes on its
borders as the corpuscles are drawn toward the center. A star
with six points is well marked when the ervstallization has taken
place slowly: more rarely the crystals assume the plumule form.
Ammonium nitrate frequently forms remarkable greups of crystals
in the shape of crosses and swords, like those obtained by evaporating
a drop of snow water. In no other manner can similar crystals be
obtained, neither by varying the solution of the salts nor the method
of evaporation. It will form only im regular crystals ramifying
uniformly from a common stem or else in isolated prisms. Tissan-
dier attributes this peculiar crystallization in meteoric water to some
organic matter dissolved in the rain or snow. The evaporation of
this water leaves in the bottom of the vessel a hard, fragile residue
somewhat similar in appearance to coagulated albumen. Crystals
of ammonium nitrate are easily recognized by their solubility in
alcohol and by the fact that heat decomposes them without residue.
Their presence in the air can not be verified, since, as everyone knows,
nitric acid and ammonia unite readily to form ammonium nitrate.

.
246 METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

f

Sulphate of soda—Sulphate of soda is frequently found in the
matter soluble in water, and it crystallizes in four-sided prisms, like
those formed by a supersaturated solution of that salt. It is only
necessary to introduce into one of these solutions a few flakes of snow
to determine immediately its crystallization. Monsieur Goernez has
shown that deposits from the most widely varied locations have this
same property. Its presence in the air, however, is determined with
less certainty than that of the more widely prevalent ammonium
nitrate, and the atmospheric deposits show in every case the crystalli-
zation of a supersaturated solution of that nitrate. Not only has
Monsieur Goernez demonstrated that flakes of snow or solid atmos-
pheric sediments will determine the crystallization of supersaturated
solutions of soda sulphate, but that almost all bodies exposed to the
-air will do the same, showing that all these bodies contain traces of
soda sulphate, somewhat difficult to detect by chemical processes, but
made apparent by using supersaturated solutions of that salt as
reagents.

The prevalence of soda sulphate is everywhere demonstrated, and
since that salt exists in water, mineral, river, or sea, 1t 1s naturally
found in the soil. Having a tendency to crystallize in a finely
divided state on the surface of a porous body, the least wind will
carry it off and deposit it elsewhere. Simple evaporation of waters
containing sulphate of soda may perhaps account for its presence
in the atmosphere. The same is true of any soluble body contained
in water; the salt thus dissolved may be carried off by evaporation
and be distributed in small quantities in the surrounding atmosphere.
This has been proven in the case of perchloride of iron by evaporat-
ing a solution thereof above the boiling point of the liquid.

Still other causes favor the presence of sulphate of soda in the air.
Sulphurous g gas, sulphuretted hydrogen produced in the atmosphere,
is there easily transformed into sulphuric acid and on coming into
contact with salt from the ocean produces a sulphate of soda. Again,
the carbonate of soda in the presence of calcium sulphate, and numer-
ous other sulphates as well, will give a soda sulphate and some carbon-
ates. So it is established that sulphate of soda is formed in various
ways and that in a humid porous body it crystallizes so minutely
that the least puff of wind will scatter it everywhere. Whatever
may be the origin of sulphate of soda, which is in the earth and
water, it is apparent that sodium in that form is one of the commonest
elements in the atmosphere.

Sea sait.—Sea salt, which will crystallize in cubes on the evaporation
of meteoric water, is also found in the air. Its presence was deter-
mined in melted snow collected on the lofty tower of Notre Dame in
December, 1874. But residual dusts from melted rain and snow have
no action on the supersaturated solutions of acetate, borate, hyposul-
METALS IN THE ATMOSPHERE. 247

phate, or soda sulphate, which shows that these substances, although
efforscent, are only accidental in the atmosphere. The same is true of
nitrate of lime and calcium chloride, which are readily given up to
the air, although their sources are not to be found in the atmosphere.

Accidental substances.—Besides the dusts which the normal air
almost always contains, there are those more exceptional ones of
voleanic origin. Such was a dust which fell with the snow in Nor-
way on March 29-30, 1878; it was gray and fibrous, formed of grains
of 0.02 to 0.03 mm. diameter. These were characteristic fragments of
pumice and little grains of iron oxide in octahedron cuboids. There
are numerous examples of the transportation for great distances of
dusts, voleanie cinders, and ashes from great fires.” For instance,
the sand that fell on the western Canaries on the 7th of February,
1863, came in all probability from the Sahara, more than 200 miles.
More recently the cinders from the great Chicago fire arrived at the
Azores some forty days after the beginning of the catastrophe. The
celebrated dry fog, which in 1783 covered all Europe tor three months,
first appeared at Copenhagen, where it continued one hundred and
twenty-six days. It was caused by an eruption in Iceland. In Sep-
tember, 1845, a phenomenon of the same sort but less formidable was
observed on the Shetland and Orkney Islands. This came from an
eruption of Hecla on September 2, and the cinders had traveled more
than 500 miles. The atoms that fell during the cyclone of 1879 in the
vicinity of Naples and Palermo were tinged with vellow. In that
region also have been found black spheres and globules, susceptible to
the magnet, the diameters of which at Palermo were between 0.004
and 0.028 mm.; at Naples 0.007 to 0.020 mm., and from 0.011 to 0.040
mm. at Teramo. These measurements agree well with those magnetic
spherules following on the coasts of Algeria and Tunis.

A shower of cinders fell in the vicinity of Etna from the 24th to
the 29th of May, 1886; examined in the observatory of Palermo, they
showed the ttle laminated crystals characteristic of the ejections of
Ktna. Similar phenomenon have been observed after the eruption
of Krakatao. j

Conclusion.—Leaving aside the dusts which are temporarily
brought into the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions or other accidents,
we see that the air ordinarily contains only a small number of metals—
sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, and more especially nickel,
cobalt, and iron. These have all a terrestrial origin, except the last
three, which come from out of planetary space. The proportion of
solid matter in the air does not appear great enough to be of sig-
nificance in the physiography of the earth, but almost a third of it
is composed of organic matter containing living germs... This part
at least concerns the biologist and assumes some importance from its
pathological consequences.

OBSERVATIONS ON VISION IN BRIGHTNESS AND IN
OBSCURITY, WITH A HYPOTHESIS ON THE CAUSE
OF COLOR-BLINDNESS.¢

By O. LUMMER.

A. Turory or J. v. Krtes.?

It has long been known that the retinal laver of rods and cones con-
stitutes a structure sensitive to hght by means of which energetic im-
pulses from without excite the optic nerve. While investigations
concerning acuity of vision appear to warrant the conclusion that
the cones alone suffice for sight, yet the anatomical structure of the
rods, closely resembling as it does that of the cones, indicates that
they, too, play a part in seeing. Recent physiological researches on
vision under feeble illumination and on the influence of the visual
purple in the rods upon the perception of color have rendered it more
and more possible to distinguish between the parts played by these
two kinds of retinal organs.’

Asa basis for the investigation we take the theory of Von Kries,
which holds that the cones are a color-perceiving “* brightness appa-
ratus,” the rods a color-blind * darkness apparatus.” According to
this theory the cones are adapted for vision under high illumination,
and their excitation by light waves produces in the brain the sensa-
tion of color, while the rods with their visual purple are insensitive
to color, become active only in dim heght, and are able to much in-
crease their sensitiveness in the dark. Von Kries calls this pecular-
ity of the rods “adaption to obscurity ” | Dunkeladaptation |. Be-
fore the cones react to color the rods convey to the brain the impres-
sion of colorless light.

We learn from the anatomy of the retina that in the fovea centralis
and a portion of the macula lutea cones only are found, rods being
entirely wanting, while on the remaining portion of the retina there
are both rods and cones, arranged, indeed, in such a manner that
toward the periphery the reds outumber the cones. We know, too,
that the fovea centralis is the special spot used when the eyes are
fixed upon an object and focused for direct vision. In fixed or
direct vision (foveal or central vision) the rods therefore take no
part; in indirect (peripheral or oblique) vision the rods as well as
the cones are employed. ‘Thus in feeble illumination the two visual
organs enter into sharp competition, and when the light becomes suf-
ficiently dim the advantage lies with the color-blind rods, so that
everything then appears gray on a gray background—that is, in
colorless light.

B. Recent ANATOMICAL DISCOVERIES RELATING TO VISION.

Recent investigations of the retina” show that very frequently
several rods are attached to a common nerve fiber, while the cones

at least those of the fovea centralis—have each a special central con-
nection. This enables us to partially understand why the stimula-
tion of the rods is felt before that of the cones, especially as they are
affected by all light waves while the cones differentiate the waves
according to length. It is estimated that we have in all 113,000,006
rods and 7,000,000 cones (of which only 4,000 are in the fovea cen-
tralis and 8,000 to 13,000 in the macula lutea), whereas connected to
them all there are only 1,000,000 nerve fibers, which, though jnter-
‘laced in a bundle like a cable, separately convey to the brain the
excitations of light.

Besides this there is, corresponding to the mosaic of the rods and
cones of the retina, an equally regular mosaic of ganglion cells in the
cortex of the occipital lobe of the brain, in the particular lobule
known as the “ cuneus,” where Munk has located the ‘“ Sehsphiire,”
or center for cortical vision. The retinal elements may therefore be
likened to the keys of a piano, by whose means, through the agency
of the conducting nerve fibers, the strings in the visual center are set
in vibration. Yet the path from the retinal elements to the cuneus
is not a direct one, but is several times interrupted. For example, in
the anterior pair of corpora quadrigemina the incoming nerve fibers
break up into many ramifications, while the path leading thence on-
ward to the cortex begins there with similar ramifications. The
finest branchlets are not, however, so connected as to allow direct

conduction (contact theory). While the funetic: of these contact
stations has been compared to that of an electrical imterruptor, Tan
inclined to think that there is here inserted in the conducting path a
potential capacity which increases the self-induction due to the propa-
gation of the electro-magnetic ght waves, in reverse of the process
of Pupin for telephoning over great distances by means of cables.

C. EXprRIMENTS ON VISION IN BRIGHTNESS AND OBpscurIty.

In order to illustrate the functions of the rods and cones and thei
competition, the following experiments are introduced :

I. DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPECTRUM BY GRADUAL HEATING OF AN INCAN-
DESCENT LAMP.

An incandescent lamp with large filament is placed in a suitable
box, and means are provided for gradually varying the heating cur-
rent between the limits corresponding to dull-red glow and ineandes-
cence. The filament serves as the source of light and a large spec-
trum is thrown on a white screen by means of a Rowland concave
grating. After the eye has become accustomed to complete dark-
ness the current is increased until the first appearance of light is
recognized on the screen. This first recognizable light is colorless,
and makes the impression of * rod-white ” luminosity. As the cur-
rent is increased the intensity of the colorless light waxes and ap-
pears to stretch farther toward both ends of the spectrum, and sensa-
tions of color are gradually associated with those of Hght. After
color begins to appear the interesting observation is made that the
position of apparent maximum intensity, lving first in the blue ereen,
is displaced more and more toward the yellow green of the spectrum.
This displacement may be confirmed by marking the brightest spot
and then letting the lamp gradually wane in intensity till only gray-
white luminosity remains. The spot where this is seen brightest is
then marked, and the light is increased till both marks are seen.

From this experiment it follows that the rods first perceive light,
and that their greatest sensitiveness is for the blue-green region of
spectrum, while the cones are most sensitive to yellow green. The
experiment 1s founded on the researches of Draper “and TL. Ff. Weber."

II. EXPERIMENT WITIT GLOWING PLATINUM FOIL.

In order to show the competition between the rods and cones a
large strip of platinum foil is gradually heated by an electric current
from a dull reddish luminosity to a bright-red elow. Observed

directly the foil appears always red and sharply defined; but ob-
served obliquely it appears brighter, loses its color and takes on a
whitish brilliance, at the same time losing sharpness of contour.
These apparent changes of color and brightness can be noticed even
at a bright-red glow.

III. EXPERIMENT WITH THREE GLOWLAMPS HAVING LARGE FILAMENTS
(“ GRAY GLOW” AND “ RED GLOW ”).2

(a) The competition between the two organs of sight is yet more
obvious when several parallel glowlamps with large filaments are
set up at a distance of 1 to 1$ m. apart and provided with means for
gradually decreasing the electric current. As long as the brightness
of the lamps is so feeble that the rods assist in observing them, only
the one directiy observed appears red, while the others seem to have
a colorless, magical, rod-white luminosity. However quickly the eye
passes from one lamp to another, only that directly observed at the
instant is red—the others at once change to white.

(b) In order to show that the “ gray glow ” is perceived before
the “red glow ” appears, the current is entirely cut off. Then the
lamps fade slowly (owing to their thick filaments) and the directly
observed lamp, which is red, disappears, while the others, seen
obliquely, still present a white luminosity. By turning the current
off and on this observation nmiay be repeated as many times as one
pleases, and the thicker the filaments the more successful the experi-
ment. For a lecture experiment the distance of the lamps would
naturally be greater.

IV. EXPERIMENT WITH A VERY SMALL BLUE FLAME.

Observe directly and then obliquely a blue gas flame from an easily
regulated burner with a small orifice. As observed directly the flame
appears sharply defined and of a blue color, but with indirect vision
its appearance changes to 2 disk of some size having the appearance
of moonlight and surrounded by a feebly Imminous zone.

V. COLORLESS APPEARANCE OF THE SPECTRUM WHEN THE ILLUMINATION
IS FEEBLE.

A pure spectrum of an are ght is produced, and its intensity
gradually diminished by means of two Nicol prisms. The red and
blue colors are the first to disappear, then the yellow, and finally
there remains in place of the bright-colored spectrum a colorless, dull
spectrum, which when viewed obliquely takes on a rod-white Inumi-
nosity over its whole length.

(The writer connects with this phenomenon, which was first ob-
served by Von Bezold and later more exactly investigated by Hering
and Hillebrand, the origin of the theories of Kénig and Von Kries.)

VI. THE PURKINJE PHENOMENON WITH LARGE AND SMALL FIELDS.

(a) Large fields—A projection apparatus with two large Nicol
prisms is suitable for the demonstration of the Purkinje phenomenon.
For this purpose the slit is replaced by a round opening, and an
enlarged image is thrown upon the various colored fields to be com-
pared. These are preferably of colored paper, from which four
ares are combined to form a large field. Red and blue-green are
suitable colors and are to be so chosen that with the strongest avail-
able lighting the red is perceived to be more bright than the blue-
green. In case suitable papers are not available, the same effect can
be reached by interposing in the beam suitably colored glasses: or
stained gelatin films. Hf the brightness of the hght is gradually
diminished, the blue-green becomes at length brighter than the red,
and finally the red disappears, while the blue-green changes to the
colorless * rod-white.”

(b) Observation of small fields.—The large field just described
is covered with black paper or velvet, except in two small spots. where
the colored paper may be seen. Now, however much the intensity
of the light is diminished, the red always appears brighter than the
blue-green, provided both spots are observed directly so that their
images fall on the fovea centralis or macula lutea, and not toward the
periphery of the retina where both rods and cones are present.

(c) Alternate observation of the large and small fields.—In order
to make the competition of the rods and cones still more striking, the
two fields may be observed alternately. Having reduced the inten-
sity of the light on the small field, all the while recognizing the red
to be brighter than the blue-green, the screen is removed and the eye
sees, again, suddenly, the large field. The blue-green parts now
appear colorless, but of a magical brightness, while the red parts
become almost black.

The Purkinje phenomenon may be observed in ordinary conditions,
as when a picture gallery is visited on a very cloudy day or in the
twihght, for then all the red tints appear dark and obscure, and all
the blue ones colorless and whitish.

Helmholtz also mentions that of all objects the blue sky appeared to
retain color longest at twilight, and T believe Tam right in assuming

be

that the moonht landscape is * rod-white,” for at least the silver lus-
ter of moonlight is very similar to the ghostly gray-white of the rods.

4 OBSERVATIONS ON VISION.
VII. OCULAR PHANTOMS.

The hallucinations of rod vision are best illustrated when a small
surface is observed whose retinal image does not exceed the area of
most distinct vision and whose gradual increase of brightness can be
noted, beginning with darkness. I employ the following apparatus:
An electrical glow lamp of 65-volt type is placed in a box with a sin-
gle aperture 15 mm. in diameter, and connected to a 110-volt cirenit
whose current may be gradually varied from zero upward. Behind
the opening is placed a dark shutter, and in front of this a movable
brass diaphragm with different holes of 3, 6, and 9 mm. diameters.
An enlarged, distinct image of the sharply bounded aperture is then
cast on a white screen, and there are placed in the path of the beam
several sheets of gelatin stained blue-green, so that the rods are more
strongly impressed than the cones.

So long as the brightness is so feeble that the cones are excluded,
the light spot, seen obliquely, appears colorless and lacking sharp
outlines; but it quite disappears when gazed at fixedly. This dis-
appearance occurs even when the light spot is so large that its image
covers the whole of the macula lutea, as shown by the introduction
of the larger diaphragm. To be sure, the disappearance is more
difficult to produce, because the shghtest movement of the eyes then
renders the spot visible, and the wandering eve involuntarily takes the
position where it receives the most hght. Hence it happens that the
spot floats in and out of the vision, for as soon as we attempt to fix
distinctly what we saw indirectly the “ ghost” disappears. But
when the light is made so bright that the cones are impressed this
condition of things ceases, and we see the hght spot distinctly and at
rest with its sharp outlines and its blue-green color. The experiment
is less suecessful when performed with red stained gelatin, but even
in this case the spot may be caused to disappear by proper reduction
of the illumination, as in Experiment ITI, where the dark-red glow-
ing lamp filament becomes invisible by direct vision, while vielding
the gray-glow appearance with oblique vision.

[| Typothesis as to the cause of color-blindness. |

Discrimination between the rods and cones and acquaintance with
their different functions has not yet furnished the answer to the ques-
tion why the cones differentiate colors, or what means they employ,
and why the rods grow more sensitive in obscurity. It is true that
the cones are destitute of the visual purple, so that perhaps this plays
a. part in “ adaptation to obscurity.”

OBSERVATIONS ON VISION. 955

But what anatomical peculiarity have the cones which enables
them to distinguish'red from blue? For it seems clear that this dis-
tinction is made in the retina and not in the brain.

It is a fact that in the eyes of birds, which, moreover, have many
more cones than rods over the whole extent of the retina, all the
cones have color-differentiating organs; oil cells colored red, yellow,
blue, and green. But these oil cells are found only in the cones of
birds and certain amphibious animals and reptiles, not at all in man.
And yet our cones have a special structure different from the rods,
for the outer members show a series of plane parallel plates whose
distance apart Max Schultze estimates to be in conformity with
the wave lengths of light. May not these plates serve to differen-
tiate the light as in Lippman’s method of color photography ?
Against this view, which I find was propounded a long time ago
by W. Zenker® and Max Schultze, and then again apparently for-
gotten, there is the objection that the rods also in * hardening ” show
a distinet platelike separation. But before using the fact to oppose
the hypothesis above mentioned, it must be proved that the rods show-
ig this platelike separation are not from the edge of the macula
lutea. I am inclined to beheve that the rods which border upon
the macula lutea tend to approach a more conelike type than the
others.

However this may be, the phenomenon of total color blindness or
lack of all color perception can scarcely be satisfactorily explained
by the Young-Helmholtz or the Hering theories, which assume that
the visual substances are either fused into one or partly absent.
Admitting, however, that the distinction of colors belongs to the cones
and colorless vision to the rods, it is easy on the other hand to explain
total color-blindness by the hypothesis that im such cases the cones are
absent. This explanation was advanced by H. Kénig and supported
by the fact that all animals which live in darkness (the bat, mole,
hedgehog, nocturnal monkey, and others) have no cones. These ani-
rod seers.” The in-

oe

mals have been desigiuated by Max Schultze as
vestigations of Greeff show that in the fovea centralis of the rat also
rods alone are present and are extremely fine (thickness 0.75 s0),
while the existence of a few cones is only known by the occurrence
of cone ‘granules in the outer granular layer.

* Rod seers ” then view everything, even in broad daylight, as color-
less, and, in case their fovea centralis has no rods, are, at this spot,
totally blind, like ordinary persons in darkness. ‘Totally color-blind
persons see the sun-hehted landscape as a rod landscape, as we see it
by faint moonlight. Total color-blindness is therefore a very marked
defect. Some persons are, however, partially color-blind, by which is

256 OBSERVATIONS ON VISION.

generally meant that they confuse colors rather than are actually
blind to any, and indeed they confuse pigments only, while pure
spectral colors are distinguished by them almost as well as by persons
of normal vision.

Similar as the two svstems may be in many respects, there are yet
several noteworthy differences, which appear best in the observation
of a pure, brilliantly colored, and strongly lighted spectrum.

(1) While normal eyes distinguish red, yellow, green, blue, and
violet, to the color-blind the blue-green zone appears without color,
merely having a gray white luminosity (‘“neutral” zone of the
color-blind).

(2). To color-blind persons the red end of the spectrum is shortened
as compared with the blue.

(3) To color-blind persons a mixture of red and blue produces
white, whereas such a mixture Is rose-red to normal eyes.

The yellow and blue parts of the spectrum appear as vividly to
color-blind persons as to those of normal vision, and so also do yellow
and blue pigments. From this it follows that the color vision of the
color-blind is effected by the cones like the color vision of normal
eves. In view of the fact that we do not know what are the color
differentiating organs of the cones it is doubly difficult to assign
causes for these various differences in color vision. Do these differ-
ences perhaps depend on a different structure of the cones?

Struck by the coincidence of the “ neutral” zone with the color of
maximum sensitiveness for rod vision, the thought forced itself to
my attention that the peculiarities of color-blindness might be ex-
plained by supposing that the retina of a color-blind person in the
region of direct vision where normal eyes have only cones contains
rods as well.

Without ascertaining whether this idea is new or old, I present the
following experiment to prove that the peculiarities of color-blindness
are found in peripheral vision with normal eyes when care is taken to
perceive them: .

Probably few persons have ever carefully examined a bright spec-
trum under oblique vision. Upon thus observing a long stretch of the
spectrum there is seen, in fact, as I had expected, a colorless brillant
white “ neutral ” zone lying in the place of the blue-green. — Futher-
more, the red end of the spectrum is shortened, and only reddish -vel-
low and blue appear as vivid colors.

sut a further consequence follows from the hypothesis that color-
blind persons have both rods and cones all over the retina, includ-
ing the fovea centralis. For if this is the reason why the color-blind
see a mixture of red and blue as white, normal eyes ought to receive
the same impression with oblique vision, Such is indeed the case
OBSERVATIONS ON VISION. 957

when the red and blue ends of the spectrum are superposed and
obliquely observed. :

This is otherwise shown by recombining a prismatic spectrum to
produce white, but with the interposition of a screen which cuts off
the yellow, green, and blue-green colors. Then the mixed field
appears of a brilliant rose-red by direct vision, but a brilliant white
when obliquely observed. For a check the red or blue may alter-
nately be cut off, and then by oblique vision the apparently white field
is correctly seen in the remaining active color. There is a striking
appearance peculiar to the obliquely observed mixed field) which
gives one the impression that it is self-luminous or fluorescent.“

It is hard to say why it is that color-confusing persons see red
and green pigment fields as gray-white and confuse them, while per-
sons of normal vision sharply distinguish between them. A possible
explanation might be that in bright hght the fovea centralis is the
principal agent of vision overcoming the peripheral retinal field,
and that we see extensive bright fields not at one time but by sweep-
ing over them with the fovea. Thus we cease to distinguish the
colored papers confused by the “ color-blind” only when we really
observe them obliquely, so that their colors are lost in gray-white,
even in daylight. In the condition of adaptation to obscurity, on
the contrary, the fovea centralis is excelled by the peripheral region
of the retina rich im rods, so that we no longer perceive the impres-
sions of the fovea. (Compare Purkinje phenomenon. )

A greater difficulty seems to me to be that according to this hy-
pothesis of color-blindness color-blind persons ought to perceive
with direct vision also the Purkinje phenomenon and the displace-
ment of the “neutral zone” which follows diminution of bright-
ness. As Professor Nagel has been good enough to inform me, how-
ever, the Purkinje phenomenon absolutely ceases with him, at least
at the fovea centralis.’ Since, however, his fovea centralis is color-
blind, I find myself compelled to add a second hypothesis, as follows:

The rods which occur in the fovea centralis and part of those in
the macula lutea of color-blind persons must have lost their readiness
of adaptation, and therefore are equipped with a higher sensitiveness
for vision in strong lights than those of normal persons.

a These color-mixing experiments were successfully performed by Professor
Pringsheim, Doctor Gehreke, and myself in a room which was lighted by two
incandescent lanps, although, to be sure, feebly.

6If this is so with Professor Brodhun (who confuses red and green) also,
then reasoning backward it follows that his fundamental experiment on the
displacement of the neutral zone (a distinet proof of the competition of rods
and cones) owing to the smallness of the field of the Helmholtz color-mixing
apparatus, must have been performmed unconsciously with extra foveal—that is,
peripheral, retinal vision.

958 OBSERVATIONS ON VISION.

We will distinguish these rods as “ central” and “ bright-vision ”
rods to distinguish them from ‘“ peripheral” or.“ obscure-vision ”
rods. In order to prove their existence there is necessity for physi-
ological experiments of a kind suited to distinguish the differences
that occur between normal and color-blind persons in direct central
vision of fields of different size. The Purkinje phenomenon and the
displacement of the “ neutral” zone with diminishing ght intensity
mast be more accurately studied with different individuals in order
to recognize how far the rods extend toward the fovea centralis in
normal eyes, and where the “ central” rods of the color-blind begin
to be capable of adaptation and become * peripheral.”

Perhaps this hypothesis might also be tested by anatomical re-
searches on the retinas of color-blind persons, although it would be
difficult to distinguish the “central” rods from the cones, for it
appears that the cones approach more nearly to the rods in structure
the nearer they he to the center. Besides this the anatomist must be
informed whether he is examining normal or color-blind eyes.

When I found that this (possibly not original) hypothesis had
not as yet been carefully tested, I thought it worth publishing even
if hereafter found to be false, since the careful experiments which
its testing demands can not but throw lght on this interesting
subject. There appears to be no logical or zoological argument
opposed to it, for since there are animals with more cones than
rods (birds) and animals and men with rods only (animals living
in darkness and the totally color-blind), and since persons of nor-
mal vision lie between these classes and possess more rods than
cones and one spot entirely rod-free, why may there not be indi-
viduals having rods in this small spot, too? And if this is the
case, then it is not strange that these central rods by continued
usurpation of the place of the cones should have become bright-
vision organs, and have lost their adaptive quality. The fact of
the great number of color-blind persons (3 per cent of males and
one-fourth of 1 per cent of females) supports the hypothesis, for
it readily explains the great variations between individuals. For,
according to the number of “central” rods, the degree of their
sensibility, the extent of the area over which they have lost adapta-
bility, and the degree to which they have supplanted the cones, by
such gradations may normal color perception degenerate into the
various degrees of color confusion, or even into total color-blindness.

A LIGHTNING SPIRAL OBSERVED NEAR BASEL!

By Fr. IKLINGELFUSS.

On the night of July 15, 1902, between 11 and 12 o’clock, I
obtained, in a fixed camera, a photograph of a very extraordinary
lightning phenomenon. The flash occurred in an east-southeast di-
rection, as viewed from the center of the city of Basel, and extended
nearly horizontally from north toward south, or, as shown in figure
1, plate 1, from left toward right. Not all the details seen in the
photograph could be recognized by the eye, nor could I determine
the distance from my standpoint to the scene of the discharge,
because of the simultaneous sound of thunder from another flash.
As the lens of the camera was uncovered for this exposure only a
few seconds, it is probable that all that is shown in the illustration
represents but one discharge.

Besides a pencil of parallel rays (caused probably by partial dis-
charges torn apart by wind currents), such as is familar from the
photograph of H. Kayser,’ the plate which is here shown contains
two very distinct whirls of bright lines and a third fainter one. In
addition there may be recognized a great number of bright lines
running parallel to the axis of these spirals. Within the pitch of
a single line of the spiral 50 or 60 parallel lines may be counted.

Inasmuch as a similar screw-shaped formation may be observed
under certain conditions in the discharge of an induction coil, it
seems highly probable that we have here to do with a spiral light-
ning discharge. Thus when a very great quantity of electricity is
discharged with the bluest possible sparks and without strong aureole
or are there are produced magnificent spirals.© Figure 2, plate 1,
shows an instantaneous exposure of about 0.05 second duration on
such a discharge from an induction coil giving sparks 50 cm. long.
The greater the quantity of electricity in the discharge the more

regular are the spirals, as is to be expected. In order to fulfill
the conditions above mentioned, a very high frequency is of course
required, such as may be obtained with the electrolytic interrupter.
Such spirals depend on the direction of the discharge in reference:
to the magnetic field of the induction coil or of the earth. Stereo-
scopic Instantaneous exposures of less than 0.001 second show the
image of an irregularly wound line turning sometimes left-handed
and sometimes right-handed. With are discharges no spirals are
produced, probably because at the high temperatures accompany-
ing the are the magnetic lines of force are no longer present.

These conditions for the production of electric screw discharges
seem to have been present in marked degree with the lightning dis-
charge photographed. The discharge shows an extraordinary num-
ber of lines, partly in the spirals and partly running horizontally
in the general path. Each line corresponds to a partial discharge,
and the regularity of spacing of the lines in the spirals indicates a
very large quantity of electricity discharged and a very high fre-
quency. Undoubtedly the quantity discharged far exceeds any-
thing of the kind we can obtain from an induction coil. This
explains the great regularity of the lightning spirals as compared
with those obtained from the mduction coil. In the observed case,
too, the earth’s magnetic field was favorably situated, since the
magnetic field produced by the spiral discharge coincided with it.

In order to determine if the lightning spiral produced any unusual
magnetic field whose presence would be indicated by marked deflec-
tions of the magnetic needle,” I addressed communications to the
Swiss meteorological Zentralanstalt at Zurich, and to the kgl. meteor-
ologische Observatoriun: at Potsdam. The Swiss meteorological bu-
reau was, unfortunately. unable to furnish the desired information,
but I received from the director of the observatory at Potsdam the
following negative reply :

So far as concerns our observatory, it may be said in answer to your inquiry
that on the day in question neither the terrestrial magnetic instruments nor the
apparatus for observing atmospheric electricity (the latter records, within mod-
erate limits, not only the potential difference but also the discharging capacity
observed) showed any extraordinary behavior.

It is interesting to note that the photograph indicates that the par-
tial discharges of this flash could not have been oscillating, but must
have pulsed successively in the same direction in order to produce the
direction of rotation here shown.

VARIATIONS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY.
By G. W. A. KAHLBAUM.

In connection with researches on the distillation of metals, and
while seeking to fix the specific gravity of the pure metals employed,
T was led to make a thorough study of the subject of specific gravity
measurements.? The grounds which led me to bestow so much atten-
tion on this subject apparently so threadbare are these: First, the
exact measurement of specific gravity, particularly for solid bodies,
is an extremely difficult piece of work, which can be successfully
accomphshed only by attending to certain not unimportant pre-
‘autionary measures; and, second, the specific gravity to be deter-
inined is to be regarded rather as the expression of particular prop-
erties of the individual specimen examimed than as a general property
of all solids of the same kind.

This latter statement may be illustrated by the following determi-
nations made on a small block of the purest Norwegian converter
copper refinings, for which chemical analysis yielded 99.92 per cent
copper, 0.02 per cent silver, 0.04 per cent nickel, and 0.02 per cent iron.
Three small bars, 6 mm. in diameter and 45 mm. in length, were pre-
pared, containing about 1.25 cm® each, and their specific gravity was
determined within a mean error of 0.0016, as follows: I, 8.4412: IT,
8.6926; TET, 8.4297.

Thus it appears that three cylinders, turned from a single small
block of copper, showed a variation of specific gravity through a
‘ange of 0.2629, or over 34 per cent of the whole specific gravity.
Inasmuch as this was cast copper it was easy to explain the cause of
ihe variation, for probably there were faults or blowholes in the
casting. But the interesting and natural question arose, Where and
when do such faults cease entirely ?

With another cylinder of the same copper, weighing 79 grams, I
made careful measurements by the volumetric method, depending

VARIATIONS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY.

on 140 separate determinations with the spherometer, and obtained
the value of the specific gravity as 8.3774, which is a little less than
that found for any of the smaller samples. It might be supposed
that the difference of 0.32 between this value and that obtained for
Sample IT would be nearly the maximum obtainable. But Marchand
and Scheerer ¢ by very accurate determinations found for their high-
est value of the density of rolled and hammered copper plate 8.952, or
0.259 higher than my highest observed value, and, compared with
my lowest value, showing a difference of 6.2 per cent.

It seems simple enough in the case of metals to do away with these
differences of specific gravity by employing high pressures sufficient
to close the faults produced in casting. But I have found in experi-
ments with lead, cadmium, copper, tin, antimony, gold, and silver
that up to a pressure of 10,000 atmospheres all these metals except
‘admium show increased density with increased pressure, as was to
be expected, but on increasing the pressure to 20,000 atmospheres
these metals without exception diminished in density with the in-
creased pressure. It is not implied that the density rises in all cases
except that of cadmium up to 10,000 atmospheres pressure and then
diminishes, but that if any decrease occurred below 10,000 atmos-
pheres the density did not fall. below the original value.’ It would
doubtless be of great theoretical interest to determine the exact pres-
sure of maximum specific gravity, but working as hitherto with
samples would consume much time, and it seemed to me that a shorter
method based on electrical conductivity measurements would prove
feasible. For if the electrical conductivity 1s measured continuously
while the pressure is steadily augmented there must be a change in
the march of the conductivity measurements when the pressure of
maximum specific gravity is reached. Without going into a deserip-
tion of the experiments, it will suffice to say that I was led in this
way to the examination of the specific gravity of wires. An altera-
{ion of the density implies a change in the molecular structure of the
material. Such a change in the structure of wires is indicated by
the fact that cold-drawn wires are brittle and liable to faults, and
that in order to continue wire drawing a reheating is required.°

In wire drawing the metal must be drawn or, as in the case of
sodium presses, squeezed through a hole with sharply defined edges.
In this process there is formed at the back of the drawplate a ring of
material, which is held back while the inner molecules by virtue of
their cohesion are pressed or drawn through the opening. Metals

which are too soft—lead, for example—have too little cohesion, and
are torn in attempting to draw them into wires.

Tn the process of wire drawing the metals are then in fact com-
pressed, and in accordance with what has been said, a certain dim-
inution of density is to be expected if the pressure is high enough,
but there are no certain grounds to predict what might happen in
further continuation of the process.

IT had formerly found advantage in the use of the pyknometer, in-
stead of the Archimedean method of determining specific gravity,
but had found an improvement in the latter when the supporting
wire is carefully platinized. By the friendly advice of Dr. Ch. Ed.
Guillaume and Dr. P. Chappius, both of the Bureau International
des Poids et Mesures in Pavillon de Breteuil in Sévres, who have
been good enough to impart to me and my colleague the approved
method employed at that institution, we have been able to avoid com-
pletely the error formerly encountered, and have employed the
method of displacement, with the same success we had previously
obtained by the pyknometer.

I give here only a small part of the results obtained, and choose
for the purpose of illustration the experiments with platinum. It is
not only a duty but a privilege to acknowledge in this connection the
uncommon goodness of the firm of W. C. Heriius, in Hanau, who
have not only furnished me liberally with the costly material, but
also, to avoid error, have separately drawn all the wires required for
the research.

Three parallel series of experiments were carried out, as follows:
Irom a single bar of the Jleraus commercial platinum pieces lying
side by side were cut off, and three cylinders, each about 6 mm. in
diameter and 35 mm. long, were turned to a uniform weight of 32
grams, then sent to us in Basel, where we determined their specific
gravity. We then returned the samples to Hanau, where by rolling
and hammering they were reduced to a diameter of 3 and length of
55 mm., suitable for wire drawing. The specific gravity of these
samples was again measured in Basel. Returning them to Hanau,
they were drawn successively to wires of 1, 0.7, and 0.4 mm. diameter.
After each drawing complete determination of the specific gravities
of these wires was made in Basel, and they were then before further
drawing softened by heating to incandescence for three minutes.
But before being further drawn—the wires were always cold
drawn—the density of these softened wires was determined, so that
we made 3 times 3 determinations on hard wire and the same number
on soft wire.*

The results which I now proceed to give are the mean of three re-

peated experiments with each of the three samples at each stage of
its treatment. These measurements were made without exception by
my colleague, Mr. F. Sturm, and the mean error of the 69 deter-
minations has the extremely satisfactory value of only 0.0004.

These numbers confirm my earlier statement, and show that even
with such a favorable material as platinum the results are strongly
affected by the individuality of the sample examined. Samples cut
from immediate proximity off the same bar show a difference of
density of 0.1734.

By rolling and hammering the density is increased by, roughly, 1
per cent, and the difference of density between the three samples is
at the same time reduced to about one-tenth its former magnitude.
There is then nothing new in Table I, which merely proves the pres-
ence of pores or faults, which are diminished by the application of
mechanical force.

Table II is, however, more interesting :

Sample 1, which had the highest density as hammered platinum,
showed a diminution in specific gravity of 0.0178, which is a differ-

Such are the results, which confirm the earher discovery that
excessive compression diminishes the specific gravity. T have already
drawn attention to the analogy here presented to the behavior of
gases under high pressures, which are less compressible than Boyle’s
law requires.

The explanation of this curious behavior of wires may, however,
depend on such factors as crystalline configuration, and, at all events,
requires further experiments to determine.

A second new and very important result appears, that strongly
compressed wires Increase In specific gravity when heated to incan-
descence. This indicates that an increase of the kinetic energy of
the molecules suffices to restore them to their normal relations, but I
do not venture here upon any explanation of the phenomenon and
content myself with pointing out this new and independent proof of
the variability of specific gravity.

«Here follows in the original article an explanation of the author’s relations
with Hr. W. Spring in connection with the publication of their joint researches
bearing on this subject.

These experiments have lately been continued in Basel by my col-
league, and he finds that glowed platinum wire 0.4 mm. in diameter
of specific gravity 21.4817 fell off in density to 21.4183 when drawn
to 0.1 mm., and on being heated white hot again rose to 21.4346. Wires
of chemically pure platinum, an alloy of platinum with 10 per cent
iridium, aluminum, and copper all behave in a similar manner, and
rolled aluminum foil and hammered zine plates as well.

A change of electrical conductivity had previously been noted after
incandescence in cold-drawn wires of platinum, platinum-iridium,
aluminum, and copper. /

These researches will be continued in all the directions here indi-
sated, and an attempt will be made to measure the alterations by the

SOME NEW MODES OF LIGHTING.¢

By A. BeRrTater.

Incandescent petroleum otf lamps.—During the last quarter of a
century the use of petroleum and its derivatives for Ulumination has
been much restricted by the growth of incandescent lighting by
electricity, acetylene, and illuminating gas; but quite recently there
has developed a new use of petroleum oil for imeandescent mantle
lighting. Various systems have been proposed, of which the earlier
ones depended on the carbureting of air by the aid of some special
device and the distribution of this mixture under feeble pressure.

Owing to complications of the mechanism and the tendency of
stoppage in conducting passages these earher arrangements found
little favor, but the inventors of the Washington, Kitson, and Glitseh
systems have succeeded in avoiding separate mechanical contrivances
and automatically produce the mixture of gas and air within the lamp
itself.

In these new systems of lighting, a liquid is stored in a central
reservoir, from which runs a conducting pipe to a special distributer,
and thence small tubes lead the quid to the several lamps or heaters
to be supplied. In the Washington and Kitson systems petroleum
oil is the liquid employed, while the Gltsch system uses benzine.
The reservoir for the hquid may be either inside or outside the build-
ing, but for single lamps or heaters is often directly attached to the
‘apillary tubes which supply the burners. These capillary tubes are
of steel and hardly an eighth of an inch in external diameter, so that
they may readily be hidden from sight, and are, indeed, both less
visible and less dangerous than electric wiring. The tubes are tested
to bear a pressure of 10 atmospheres, but in use are not required to
withstand more than 4 atmospheres pressure. It is apparent, too,
that with a liquid of such sheht volatility as petroleum oil there is
much less danger of explosion in consequence of leakage than with

968 SOME NEW MODES OF LIGHTING.

The Washington lamp is already well known, although of recent
invention. It belongs to the type of Jamps in which the combustible
liquid is vaporized in a special chamber above and within reach of the
flame. Air is admitted to this chamber and, mixing with the vapor-
ized oil, is led by way of two large tubes at the side of the lamp to
feed the flame. The vaporizing device is a simple metallic tube
heated by radiation from the incandescent mantle which surrounds
it. A cock at the lower end of this tube regulates the admission of
the liquid, which, after being vaporized, passes out through a small
orifice at the top and mixes with air in the chamber above. Thence the
mixture is led downward through
the two tubes at the side of the
lamp and is conveyed to the burner
through a wire netting. The in-
‘randescent mantle, which surrounds
the vaporizer, is held by a metal
support fastened to the vaporizer
itself. Thus the flame which ren-
ders the mantle incandescent at
the same time feeds itself by vapor-
izing the oil in the tube. In the
earlier models the lamp required
to be started by first burning a little
alcohol in a cup below the burner
so as to vaporize enough oil to begin
the incandescence, after which, of
course, the lamp continued to pro-
duce the vapor consumed. As
first exhibited, the lamps were fur-
nished in two types of two and
three burners yielding, respectively,
500 and 750 candlepower, but
recently M. Georges Washington,
of Brussels, has devised other types
of less intensity, and the company is now constructing portable lamps

Fia. 1.—The Kitson lamp.

of about 50 candlepower.

The Kitson system of lighting, introduced in Germany by a Dres-
den syndicate, is analogous to the preceding. An oil reservoir, con-
veniently placed outside the dwelling, communicates by capillary
tubes to the burners. By means of a force pump an air pressure of
about 4 atmospheres is produced over the oil in the reservoir, Which
is thus caused to circulate through the capillaries.

There are several notable differences between the Washington and
Kitson lamps. In the latter a vaporizing tube, common to the several
burners of a single lamp, runs horizontally over the burners, and upon
SOME NEW MODES OF LIGHTING. 269

it is concentrated by metal screens the heat rising from the incan-
descent mantles. The yaporized oil escapes downward through a
large tube at the side of the lamp and here, mixing with air admitted
through a heated chamber, is led from beneath to the burners.

The hght of the two-burner Kitson lamp is dazzling and reaches
at least 1,000 candlepower. With specially favorable conditions, such
as with a new mantle and a high pressure of oil, 1,500 or even 2,500
candlepower is sometimes obtained. Oil is consumed at the rate of
about 0.2 liter (one-half pint) per 1,000 candlepower per hour. The
light produced has a mellow, agreeable color, much warmer in tone
than that of the electric are or the incandescent gaslight. As already
remarked, the intensity depends on the pressure, which is an inconven-
ience for a lamp of small oil capacity, but where there is a reservoir
of large dimensions the diminution of pressure during twenty-four
hours causes no considerable variation in the intensity of the lamp.

Of all methods of providing intense light, these which have been
described are most economical. It 1s possible to combine in a single
system lamps of great and relatively small intensity, and the material
employed is common and inexpensive and may serve to produce both
lighting and heating, or, indeed, motive power. ‘There are no special
dangers to be feared when the combustible quid is placed outside
the dwelling, and both the Washington and Kitson systems include
an automatic valve to close off the circulation in case of leakage. The
greatest objections are the use of liquid which has a disagreeable odor,
tends to creep, and which sometimes yields a foul and disagreeable
smoke. Finally, the production of the gas from the quid under
pressure produces a noticeable roaring sound. But for most pur-
poses these inconveniences are of minor Importance as compared with
the great advantages of a superb quality of light at minimum cost.

No other mode of lighting can compare in cheapness with the
petroleum incandescent lamp in countries where kerosene may be
bought at a cost of from 2 to 4 cents a liter (8 to 16 cents a gallon).
It is just.to add that in cases where natural gas or water power fur-
nishes an almost gratuitous source of energy the electric hght may
indeed compare in cheapness, but even then there must first be pro-
vided complicated and costly machinery.

Benzine is employed instead of petroleum in the Glitsch system, and
although somewhat more dangerous, this liquid is cleaner and in cer-
tain other respects more suitable for the purpose. It is unnecessary
to use pressure greater than 1 atmosphere to circulate benzine through
the capillary tubes, and the lamps may be fed by merely placing the
reservoir somewhat above them and depending on the force of gravity.
The method of starting combustion is very simple and consists merely
in heating the burner for twenty or thirty seconds in an auxihary
flame of alcohol in order to begin the vaporization of the benzine.

.
270 SOME NEW MODES OF LIGHTING.

As compared with petroleum incandescent lighting, the benzine
system is more expensive and less suitable for brilliant illumination,
such as is required in streets, railway stations, and factories, but on
account of its greater convenience and cleanliness is perhaps better
suited to lighting of dwellings, heating, and cooking purposes.

Alcohol may also be employed for incandescent lighting, either
alone or in a mixture, and may be distributed under feeble pressure ;
but at present the use of alcohol for this purpose does not appear to
be practically successful. In 1902 it was stated that alcohol lamps
of from 60 to 800 candlepower burned from 10 to 16 grams per candle-
power hour, while lamps of from 100 to 1,000 candlepower employ-
ing mixtures of alcohol and hydrocarbons in equal ratio consumed 5 to
10 grams of alcohol per candlepower hour. To make alcohol lighting
commercially successful it 1s necessary to find a solid or liquid hydro-
carbon soluble in alcohol and very cheap, which will give rise to
enhanced heating effect with diminished eost.

A new incandescent petroleum lamp has ap-
peared which consumes a mixture in equal parts
of the vapors of water and petroleum. Readers
may recall descriptions of an ingenious little
water vapor blow torch. The new Altmann
burner is evidently based on the same idea, but
is more compact, for it combines the reservoirs
of water and oil and requires no wick lke Mer-
cier’s blow torch. In the Altmann burner com-
plete combustion of the hydrocarbon is effected
in presence of the water vapor, and the flame,
in absence of the incandescent mantle, is blue
like that of the Bunsen gas burner. <A vertical
section of the lamp is shown in fig. 2. In the
reservoir, which 1s divided in two sections, 1s the water W and the pe-
troleum P. The two liquids pass by separate channels e to the vapor-
izing tubes dd. By means of a small auxiliary lamp placed centrally
at f, the gas tubes are heated to the temperature required to vaporize
the liquids, thus producing a mixture of gases in the chamber ¢, heated
both by the radiation of the incandescent mantle and by the little
burner f. This auxiliary burner is fed with combustible liquid con-
tained at P near the foot of the lamp. On leaving the chamber c, the
mixed vapor traverse a tube } to a burner analogous to those employed
for incandescent hghting with ordinary illuminating gas. In the
models now in use the intensity of illumination ranges from 80 to 100

vandlepower. The consumption of petroleum is about a liter (one-
fourth of a gallon) in twenty-four hours, so that the cost is about
0.002 cent per candlepower hour. A heater is constructed by the
same company which also appears to be very economical.
SOME NEW MODES OF LIGHTING. Bl

New methods of electric lighting.—As early as 1878 Archereau,
Yarré, and Gauduin sought to augment the luminosity of the electric
are by rendering the arc itself as well as the positive carbon incandes-
cent. For this purpose they mixed with the carbon of the electrodes
suitable substances such as oxides of calcium or magnesium; but
unfortunately there occurred a precipitation of the refractory oxides
upon the lower carbon, and a formation of scoria which resulted in a
prejudicial unsteadiness for illumination. After the Welsbach man-
tle attained success, new efforts were made to apply this principle of
incandescence of the arc, and Monsieur Bremer exhibited at the expo-
sition of 1900 a model having four special carbons, and in which the
light produced in the are was reflected downward. The presence of
mineral matter resulted in increasing the luminous surface, modifying
the color of the light as desired, and in diminishing by one-half the
current consumption for a given illumination.

A considerable number of concerns, notably in Germany,.are now
producing flaming are lamps more or less patterned after that of
Bremer. The principal differences consist in the varied construc-
tion of the electrodes, but all are composed of mixtures of carbon
and some salt of calcium, usually fluorspar. Professor Wedding,
having studied the influence of this substance on the consumption
of energy in the lamp, has found that the most favorable conditions
are found with 15 per cent fluorspar. Electrodes of this composi-
tion are found to consume but 0.15 watts per candle, as compared
with 0.5 watts for the ordinary are.

Doctor Arndt’s researches at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin
have shown that the operation of the flaming are does not involve
any appreciable production of objectionable gases. Furthermore,
the hght produced is of a yellowish-red color and much less cold and
harsh than that of the ordinary are. It more resembles sunlight in
color, and penetrates better through fog than the hght of shorter
wave length produced by the ordinary are.

The Bremer are requires the use of special lamps, but by employ-
ing trizonal carbons A. Blondel has avoided this inconvenience.
Minerals are contained in the two interior zones, and such ares, con-
suming only 3 amperes, have been found to give nearly three, and
similar ares, consuming 9 amperes, more than four, times the effi-
ciency of the ordinary arc light consuming equal energy.

In the same general category belongs the lamp with three elec-
trodes and two ares, devised by L. Sigfried Andersson, of Stockholm,
For the purpose of increasing the area of luminous surface, and at
the same time producing incandescence within the arc, there is
introduced between the two carbons which carry the current a third
cylinder, formed of a more refractory substance than the two others.
The regulation of this lamp is very delicate, and is effected in a most

.
WD SOME NEW MODES OF LIGHTING.

ingenious manner by means of a Wheatstone bridge, made up of the
two side ares themselves and two suitable resistances, which are
wound as electromagnets in such a manner as to operate the regulat-
ing mechanism. The central cylinder thus carries the current only
when the bridge is thrown temporarily out of balance.

Instead of rendering the are luminous by the aid of refractory
oxides, the same result may be obtained by introducing a combustible
liquid or powder through a hollow electrode. This device has been tried
by J. Akermann, but it does not seem likely to prove very practicable.

All these devices of introducing foreign substances into the arc are
evidently for the double purpose of diminishing its resistance and of
augmenting its luminosity, and there seems to be no reason why a
conducting vapor like that of mercury should not be substituted for
the solid particles of carbon or of metallic salts or oxides which have
been used for this purpose. The Cooper-Hewitt lamp is the develop-
ment of this idea. Everybody is familiar with the Geissler tubes, in
which light is produced by an electric current traversing a rarefied
gas. It is possible, as Tesla has shown, to excite such tubes to lumi-
nosity by simply placing them in a varying electrostatic field of high
frequency. About 1892 Arons showed that mercury vapor traversed

by a current emits light, but there was no idea at that time of employ-
ing this device for illuminating purposes. The credit for this discov-
ery rests, therefore, with Cooper-Hewitt, who has devised a mercury
lamp of great simplicity, composed of a glass tube with electrodes at
the two ends. The negative electrode is mercury itself, and the posi-
tive electrode may be either mercury, iron, or other metal. Platinum
wires sealed into the glass conduct the current to the electrodes.
When cold, the pressure of the mercury vapor is very small, but when
heated by the passage of the current the mercury vapor pressure rises
to about 2 mm. of liquid mercury, or about one four-hundredth of
an atmosphere.

Cooper-Hewitt lamps operate under a difference of potential of
110 volts, of which about 80 are absorbed in the are. Since the inter-
nal resistance is very high at first, this potential difference is insuf-
ficient to start the light, and several thousand volts are required for a
brief interval at the start. Accordingly some auxiliary device has to
be provided, as is the case with the Nernst lamp, to heat the con-
ductor to the temperature at which the ordinary voltage will main-
tain incandescence. For example, the required voltage may be ob-
SOME NEW MODES OF LIGHTING. oi

tained by introducing a self-induction coil in the lamp circuit, and
shunting across the lamp a quick-acting oil interrupter. The extra
current at break sutlces to start the arc, which thus primarily excited
is able to continue, and the self-induction thereafter plays the part
merely of reducing variations of the current. Figure 3 shows the
disposition of circuit adopted by Cooper-Hewitt.

Usually the tubes have the form of an inverted U, with short arms.
Each arm contains mercury, and at the top is an iron electrode.
Thus the are may pass between iron and mercury or between two
mercury electrodes as desired. In the former case the distance be-
tween electrodes is about 7 cm. and in the latter about 9 em. These
lamps are exhausted to about the same degree as ordinary incandes-
cent electric lights, and they may be run at any current strength
between 0.5 and 5 amperes. Below 0.5 amperes the are ceases, and
above 5 amperes the tube breaks, owing to the heat produced. The
difference of potential
between terminals va- ak
ries from 82 to 87 volts 2
for U tubes. The effi- ;
ciency of these lamps
is said to be upward
of three times as high
as that of the ordinary

are ready means of overcoming this primary obstacle to the use of the
mercury arc; but a second and very serious objection lies in the green
color of the light produced. Being wholly without red rays, this
light gives a ghastly appearance to the objects illuminated. On the
other hand, ace ording to German experiments the light has a great
power of penetration, and it is besides highly actinic, and thus suit-
able for photographic purposes, and, moreover, the color is not
fatiguing to the eyes. It has been proposed to introduce a warmer
tint by interposing a red mantle, but this device greatly diminishes
the efficiency. Perh; aps better results may be reached by introducing
traces of certain neutral gases, or substituting some amaleam instead
of pure mercury.

274 SOME NEW MODES OF LIGHTING.

In all the methods of lighting thus far mentioned in this article
the source is a very intense light restricted to a comparatively nar-
row area; but there has very recently been installed in New York
a system of electric lighting by vacuum tubes of great length, whose
comparatively feeble brightness 1s counterbalanced by their great
area of luminous surface. Plate I shows an application of this
method of hghting within an apartment. While not yet fully per-
fected, this system gives excellent promise, both as regards cheapness
and general satisfactory qualities of illumination. <A principal diffi-
culty seems to consist in obtaining a suitable gaseous conductor
whose spectrum shall approximate that of diffused daylight instead
of being restricted to a few wave lengths lke that of mercury, but
partial success in this respect 1s already achieved.

PROGRESS IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.2

By Wu1AM MAVER, Jr.?

The possibility of telegraphing without wires by means of electric
waves in free space was demonstrated when Dr. H. Hertz, in 1887
and 1888, holding a so-called “ electric eye,” consisting of a ring of
copper wire about 16 inches in diameter and broken at one point,
a few feet from the spark gap of an induction coil, or oscillator, was
able to detect minute sparks jumping across the break in the copper
ring.

In 1889 Doctor Branly discovered that metal filings, which, when
made part of an electric circuit, had normally a very high electrical
resistance, but became good conductors of electricity when electric
oscillations were set up in the circuit, and that they retained their
conducting qualities until shaken up.

The art of wireless telegraphy took a long forward step when, in
1894, Dr. (now Sir) Oliver Lodge made his notable experiments
before the Royal Institution, 11 which he used, as a transmitter of
electric waves, the Hertz or Righi oscillator, and as a detector of those
waves, the Branly coherer, consisting of a tube filled with metal
filings in an electric circuit containing an electric bell. To insure
the filings resuming their state of nonconductivity upon the cessa-
tion of the electric oscillations, Doctor Lodge caused a “ tapper,”
operated by clockwork, to strike the tube continuously. <A bell or
relay in the coherer circuit could thus be kept in vibration during
the continuance of electric oscillations and would become passive
when the oscillations ceased, and in this way signals could be trans-
mitted. Lodge believed that the limit of sensitiveness of this ap-
paratus would be half a mile, but even this distance would have ad-
vanced the signaling distance four-hundredfold beyond the point at
which Doctor Hertz had left it.

276 PROGRESS IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

The art, however, received its most powerful impetus when Mar-
coni, in 1898, using vertical wires 80 to 100 feet high at each station,
a 10-inch spark induction coil, and an improved Branly-Lodge co-
herer, succeeded in transmitting wireless signals a distance of about
40 miles, which distance within another twelve months, by using still
higher vertical wires and more improved apparatus, he increased to
280 miles over water.

The writer on other occasions has remarked tHat had the progress
of wireless telegraphy rested with Hertz’s discovery of the copper
ring detector, its utility for commercial purposes would have been
very limited-—in fact, nil, since the utmost distance at which signals
can be detected by that device is about 8 or 10 feet. It might now
be said that while improvements in the construction of the filings
coherer, together with increased height of the vertical wires and an
increase in their number and in the power of the transmitting appa-
ratus, render it possible to receive signals with this form of detector
at a distance of 400 to 500 miles under favorable conditions, still, had
there been no other receiving instrument than the filings coherer,
important as the improvement in that instrument has been, there
would perhaps have been little or no progress to note relative to the
speed of transmission by wireless telegraphy, which, with the filings
coherer as a receiver, may be placed at from eight to twelve words per
minute. ‘The action of the filings coherer is inherently sluggish in the
production of perfect signals, the cohering and “ tapping back,”
added to the intertia of the moving parts of the tapper, the relays,
ete., all tending to that result.

It may be noted in this relation that in ordinary shipboard prac-
tice to-day the distance signaled with the filings coherer does not
much exceed 50 miles.

It was therefore very obvious to all concerned in the art of wire-
less telegraphy that a thing much to be desired was the invention or
discovery of a coherer or detector which would, so to speak, * close ”
automatically on the occurrence of electric oscillations and “ open ”
automatically when the oscillations ceased, or vice versa. As fre-
quently happens in such cases, this desideratum, an autocoherer, was
not very long in forthcoming.

One of the first devices that bore promise of fulfilling the foregoing
requirement 1s known as Schaefer’s “ anticoherer.” This consists
of a silver film deposited on glass. Across this film slits are traced,
these being covered by a thin layer of celluloid. When the silver film
is made part of an electric circuit it is found that the resistance of the
circuit rises when electric oscillations are set up therein, and when
the oscillations cease the resistance automatically falls. This action,
it will be observed, is the reverse of what occurs in the Branly filings
coherer; hence the term anticoherer. It has heen surmised that the
PROGRESS IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. Ot

effect. of the film of celluloid, which does not penetrate into the ite-
rior of the slits, is to prevent the dissipation of the particles of sil-
ver in the slits, and whose motion under the influence of electric
oscillations probably accounts for the variations in the resistance of
the circuit. Carbon filings were also found to decohere automat-
ically; but these devices were not extensively used in practice, if
at all.

The next most important autocoherer was that due to Castell,
known for a time as the Solari coherer, also as the Italian navy
coherer. This atitocoherer was used by Marconi in his first experi-
ments in trans-Atlantic wireless telegraphy. It consists of a tube
similar to the filings coherer, but instead of metal filings between the
ends of the iron or carbon rods within the tube, a drop of mercury is
employed. In the circuit with the coherer there is a small battery
and a telephone receiver. On the arrival of electric oscillations the
mercury appears to cohere to the carbon or iron, with the result that
the resistance decreases, but immediately rises when the oscillation
ceases, these variations in the resistance of the circuit setting up noises
in the telephone, which can be read as dots and dashes when messages
are transmitted. This autodetector has the disadvantage that after
some use it becomes rather unreliable in operation, to prevent which
frequent renewals of the mercury and cleansing of the tube are neces-
sary.

Subsequently Marconi devised an autocoherer, known as a magnetic
detector, which has been used in his trans-Atlantic and other long-dis-
tance experiments. This coherer consists of a primary and secondary
coil of wire (wound over a coil of fine iron wires), the inner coil
of which is connected to the vertical wire in a manner practically
similar to that im which the filings coherer is connected. The outer
coil contains in its circuit a telephone receiver, but no battery. This
detector of electric waves is based on the observed fact that when
a magnet, such as the iron core, is caused to undergo slow changes
of magnetism, electric oscillations in the outer coil bring about rapid
changes in the magnetism of the core, which, in turn, set up currents
in the inner coil, and these are heard as clicks in the telephone
receiver.

The slow changes of magnetization referred to are brought about as
follows: An endless rope or core of fine iron
wires 1s represented in figure 1 by cc, p p are

which the coils referred to, ww, are coiled. The iron core is magnet-
ized by two horseshoe magnets (not shown in figure), the ends of
278 PROGRESS IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

which are laid with their similar poles together on the coils, their
position on the coils being changed until the best results are obtained.

In the United States, De Forest-and Fessenden have also devised
autocoherers, which are used in their respective wireless systems. The
De Forest autocoherer, which has been termed a “responder,” comprises
a tube with tin electrodes or plugs running into the bore. Between
the inner ends of the electrodes is placed a viscous substance, such as
glycerin, in which some lead oxide is suspended as a depolarizer. In
shunt circuit with the tube are a small battery and a telephone. Nor-
mally the battery sets up an electrolytic action, which tears off small
particles of tin from the positive electrode. These particles “ bridge ”
or “thread ” over the space between the ends of the plugs, with the
result that the resistance is much decreased. Incoming electric waves,
however, establish electric oscillations in the responder circuit. which
disrupt the threads or bridges, whereupon the resistance is at once
greatly increased. These variations in the resistance of the circuit
are readily indicated in the telephone, and thus when the train of
electric waves is broken into dots and dashes of the Morse code mes-
sages are easily received. This autocoherer, it will be observed, is of
the anticoherer type.

The Fessenden detector, or * barretter,” employs a different princi-
ple from either of the foregoing. Fessenden takes advantage of the
facts that an electric current increases the temperature of a conductor
through which it passes, and that an increase of temperature of the
conductor increases the electrical resistance of the conductor, and
contrariwise. He therefore employs a very thin loop of platinum
wire contained in a small glass bulb, the whole so disposed that heat
will be quickly conducted from the platinum wire. In the circuit of
this loop he includes a small battery and a telephone receiver, suit-
ably connected with the vertical wire. When oscillatory currents are
set up in the circuit, rapid variations of the temperature of the
platinum loop and corresponding variations in the resistance of the
circuit are produced, these in turn affecting the telephone receiver
practically as in the instances already given. .

More recently both Fessenden and De Forest have used a detector,
termed by the former a “ liquid barretter ” and by the latter an “ elec-
trolytic receiver,” which consists of an exceedingly fine short  plati-
num wire in a dilute nitric acid solution. The device is outlined in
figure 2, in which V is a vessel containing the liquid L; B is the fine
wire, the extent of the immersion of which is adjusted by a suitable
screw. The lower wire, m’, enters the liquid from the bottom of V.
Its size is not material. Connection with the receiving oscillating
circuit is made by means of the wire w and the wire w’. In the
usual shunt circuit from the oscillating circuit there are included the
detector, a small battery, and a telephone receiver.
PROGRESS IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 279

According to Fessenden, this device operates by reason of the fact
that practically all the resistance of the circuit is localized and con-
centrated within a short distance of the point where the cylindrical
platinum wire projects‘into the liquid. The current from the small
battery flows through the shunt circuit, but owing to the high resist-
ance of the circuit this current is normally weak. The incoming
electric oscillations decrease this resistance,
varying the circuit, and thereby producing

audible signals in the telephone. zr)
According to De Forest, the operation of this ai

detector is due to the setting up of a counter
electromotive force of polarization in the cell,
which makes the cell apparently nonconduct-
ing. Incoming oscillations cause a temporary
annulment of the insulating film of oxygen gas surrounding the posi-
tive electrode, varying the current in the local circuit, with the desired
result of producing signals readable on the telephone. There are
now two other claimants for the inventorship of this detector, namely,
H. K. Vreeland of this country, and Schloemilch of Germany, which
fact may be considered a fair indication of the practicability and re-
hability of the device.

Still another autodetector is that successfully employed in the
Lodge-Muirhead wireless telegraph system. It is shown in figure 3
and is known as the oil-film detector. It consists, essentially, of a
rotating steel disk D’, operated by clockwork. The periphery of
this disk enters a vessel 7 containing mercury m. The disk is nor-
mally prevented from making direct contact with the mercury by a
film of mineral oil, but electric oscillations in the circuit cause the
mercury and disk to cohere with the usual result.
The detector circuit is completed by wires w wi’.

By reason of the sensitiveness of the telephone re-
ceiver, changes of current that would not affect a relay
are observable in the former instrument. Hence, by
the use of this instrument much weaker electric
waves are detected than would be the case with the
filings coherer. Furthermore, the autodetector re-

minute having already been obtained by De Forest.

Marconi predicts that ultimately he will be able to transmit one

hundred words per minute by means of his detector and suitable auto-
matic transmitting and receiving apparatus.

Impertant improvements have also been made in the matter of

syntonic, or tuned. wireless telegraphy. by means of which it is

hoped to eventually transmit two or more different messages at the
280 PROGRESS IN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.

same time to and from the same stations. By tuning is meant giving
the respective transmitting circuits a fundamental period of oscilla-
tion, which can be done by proper adjustment of the capacity and in-
ductance of the oscillating circuits, analogously as the rate of vibra-
tion of a tuning fork may be varied by varying its elasticity, its
inertia, etc. Thus far it does not appear that this desirable result has
been satisfactorily accomplished. By means of tuned circuits, how-
ever, the principle of sympathetic resonance is brought into use, and
thus, with a given amount of electrical energy at the transmitter and
a detector of given sensitiveness, it is feasible to transmit messages to
a greater distance than would be the case with untuned circuits. It
may be added, also, that Fessenden, De Forest, and others have suc-
ceeded very well in cutting out interference from other stations by
means of tuning devices.

For long-distance transmission, Marconi, De Forest, and others
have successfully resorted to the use of dynamo machines for the
production of electric oscillations of much greater energy than are
obtainable by the most powerful induction coils. The height and
number of vertical wires used in long-distance transmission have
also been increased, towers 250 feet high, with 50 or more vertical
wires, being employed by several of the wireless telegraph companies.

Considerable progress has also been made in telegraphing over-
land without wires, by means of portable outfits, for military pur-
poses, much of the work of this kind having been done by Sie-
mens & Halske, of Berlin, Germany, using the Braun system. The
apparatus is transported on carts, and the vertical wire is elevated
by means of a captive balloon, or, in fair weather, by kites. The
distance to which signals can be transmitted by this apparatus is
said to be 60 miles, and it is anticipated that within a short time
all the important armies of the world will be supplied with apparatus
of this general type. Recent experiments by Marconi and Slaby-
Arco in Europe, and by De Forest in the United States, have shown
that it is possible to transmit wireless signals to distances of from 300
to 1,000 miles overland.

The most important commercial use to which this art has yet
been put, however, is that of making possible communication between
vessels at sea and between vessels and the mainland, which would
still appear to be its greatest sphere of usefulness, and every week
sees a larger number of vessels and shore stations equipped with wire-
less telegraph outfits.
ELECTRIC WELDING DEVELOPMENT.¢
By ELinvu THOMSON.

The art of welding iron is probably as old as the earliest produc-
tion of that metal by man. In fact, the reduction of iron in the
primitive forges demanded the union by welding of the reduced par-
ticles, for no true fusion could have resulted, the percentage of car-
bon present being too low. Until the closing years of the last cen-
tury iron was the only weldable metal, if we except gold and plati-
num—too expensive for common application.

The fact that nearly pure iron, so difficult to melt, becomes quite
plastic at high temperatures, while the oxide, or black scale, melts
long before the metal itself becomes fluid, thus providing a liquid
flux which is squeezed out during the process of union, accounts for
the unique position which iron held until recent years. When, how-
ever, the heating effects of electric current energy, so perfectly under
control, were applied to weld metals, a metal or alloy which would
not weld became the exception instead of the rule, as before. Much
of the former work of the smithy fire is now accomphshed by the
electric welding transformer, and although many metals are easily
manipulated by the electric process, iron, of course, still occupies, as
ever, the principal place.

The electric weld is becoming a more and more important factor
in many industries. During recent years the extension of its apph-
cation has been steady, and each year has witnessed its entrance into
new fields. Sometimes, indeed, new manufactures, or new ways of
obtaining results, have been based upon its use. The electric welds
under consideration are the results of that operation of uniting two
pieces of metal by what is known as the * Thomson process,” first
brought out by the writer and rendered available in commercial
practice a considerable number of years ago. The rapidity, flexi-
bility, cleanliness, neatness, accuracy, and economy of the electric
process has won for it such an important standing in the arts that
many future extensions in its application are assured.

The uniformity of the work, the control of the operation, the ex-
treme localization of the heat to the particular parts to be united,
and the fact that the process is not limited to iron and steel, but can

282 ELECTRIC WELDING DEVELOPMENT.

deal equally well with other metals, such as copper, brass, bronzes,
and even lead, are characteristics of the electric welding operation.

In its simplest form’an electric welder consists of a special trans-
former, the primary circuit of which receives current from an electric
station or dynamo generator at a voltage usually from 100 to 500
times that required to make a weld. The copper secondary circuit
of the transformer is generally only a single turn of very large sec-
tion, so that it may develop an extremely heavy current at from 2
to 4 volts—an electric pressure so low that it can not give the
least effect of shock, and one for which there is no difficulty in secur-
ing perfect insulation. The work pieces are held in clamps or vises,
attached to or carried upon the terminals of the single-turn secondary
circuit. The control of the clamping devices and the current switch
is either manual or, in some cases, entirely automatic. Without
attempting to enumerate the many applications of electric welding
in the arts, we may refer to a few examples.

In the wagon and carriage industry the process is applied in the
production of tires of all sections, axles, hub, spoke, and sand bands,
fifth wheels, shifting rails, steps, shaft iron, ete., while it has found
a large use in the welding into continuous strips or bands of the wires
inclosed in rubber tires for holding them in place. The larger part
of the dash-frames used in carriages in the United States are now
probably made by electric welding, while iron and steel agricultural
wheels are built up or have their parts united by electric welds.

To enumerate the many appleations to the bicycle industry would
he almost to catalogue most of the metal parts of this useful machine.
It must be borne in mind, too, that a welding machine, shghtly mod1-
fied, is equally applicable for locally heating parts in electric braz-
ing or hard soldering, for upsetting, and for bending or shaping.
Bicycle crank hangers, pedals, seatposts, fork and fork ends, frames,
and brake parts thus become products in which the welding trans-
former has its part. It has found a useful field also in tool manufac-
ture, such as drills, reamers, taps, band and circular saws, drawing
knives, carpenter’s squares, printer’s chases, ete., and electric weld-
ing has a closely related use in the production of machine parts.
Cam shafts and crank shafts are made from drop forgings welded
together, teeth are inserted into gear wheels, and teeth are welded to
saw bodies, including stone saws. Such things as inking rolls in
printing machines and fallers for looms are additional examples.

In the wire industry the part played by electric welding is already
quite important, and becomes steadily more so. Besides the mere
simple joining of wires of iron, steel, or copper into long lengths, the
welding of wire or strip into hoops for barrels, tubs, pails, etc.,,is sup-
planting the older forms. Numerous machines are in operation turn-
ing out electrically welded wire fence, much as a loom turns out cloth.

ANOTHER FORM OF Hoop OR TIRE WELDING MACHINE.
ELECTRIC WELDING DEVELOPMENT. 283

In pipe bending and coiling, as in uniting ordinary lengths of
pipe into very long lengths without screw joints, the electric weld
has a special adaptability. Hundreds of miles of street-railway rails
have been welded into continuous lengths and now exist in many
cities. Where rails are bonded only the electric welder assists in the
production of brazed or welded bonds. It is a wide range between
buckles, typewriter bars, and umbrella rods to the local annealing
of armor plates on warships, but the electric welder covers that
‘ange. It is no wider, however, than that from fine wires of a
diameter of one-fiftieth of an inch up to heavy steel wire for the
armor of submarine cables, and again up to street-railway rail joints.

In recent years elaborate machinery for the actual production on
a large scale of steel tubing from flat stock or skelp by the progres-
sive welding of a longitudinal seam has been put into operation.
The long strip, or skelp, is rolled up so that its edges meet. In this
condition it enters between the welding rolls, which pass the heating
current locally across the edges to weld them, and the operation is
progressive from one end of the pipe to the other as it is fed into
the machine. The result is a pipe of which the walls are of even
thickness and the diameter uniform. ‘This pipe can be afterwards
drawn, if needed, to the exact size desired. Very thin pipe can be
made of steel, the longitudinal seam or weld in which is a delicate
bead along the length—a beautiful product, for the extreme localiza.
tion of the heat has allowed preservation of surface and finish of the
metal outside the joint. Taper tubes, such as are used for bicycle
front forks and the like, are easily made.

A similar machine for large work has lately been constructed, and
by its use large diameter tubes or shells, up to 16 inches in diameter,
are produced from sheet steel or iron. The illustration shows such a
machine ready for operation. The welding transformer is at the top
of the machine, and the secondary circuit has for its terminals two
copper rolls inclined to each other on two nearly horizontal shafts

adjustable in position over the work. Below are the guide rolls, one
on each side on vertical shafts, and between these the shell to be
welded passes with its meeting edges uppermost and in contact with
the copper contact rolls. As the metal shell passes along under these
rolls the joint is progressively heated by the welding current crossing
it, and the weld is finished by the side pressure of the guiding rolls.
The process, as well as the resulting welded product, is unique.

For a considerable time past welding machines have been applied
to the production of bands or tires from stock of varying width, thick-
ness, and sectional form. More recently the practice of welding plain
bands or cylindrical rings, and afterwards rolling them with the form
of section desired, has been largely adopted; such as, for example, in
284 ELECTRIC WELDING DEVELOPMENT.

the production of automobile wheel rims, bands for roving cans, stove
rings, etc.

Very different from this is the formation of crank shafts, now
demanded in great numbers for engines of automobiles. These are
made from drop forgings and round shaft stock by uniting the pieces,
as in the annexed sketch, and afterwards lightly machining and fin-
ishing the approximately correct shaft, as produced by welding. No
legend.

Besides the banding of wire or strip of such comparatively frail
containing vessels as barrels or pails, the electric weld finds applica-
tion in the forming and capping of
metal vessels for withstanding high
pressures, such as soda-water cylin-
ders, carbonic-acid reservoirs, and
steel bottles for nitrous oxide gas.

One of the most interesting of the more recent applications is that
of welding hollow steel handles on cutlery, such as table knives and
forks. The operation is remarkable for the celerity and neatness of
the work, the articles being finished by silver-plating and polishing,
as usual. The hollow handle is drawn from thin steel, and united to
the knife blade or to the fork, as the case may be, in a special welding
machine, there being no brazing or other operation of joint-forming
required. There is, indeed, no limit to the delicacy of the work which
may be undertaken, provided only the welding apparatus is equally
refined.

In the simpler types of electric welders, especially where the
machine is designed to do a variety of work, perhaps of different
forms or sizes of pieces, or both, the adjustments are usually manual;
that is to say, the operations of clamping the pieces and applying the
electric current and mechanical pressure are each controlled by the
operator. In other cases, such as in the welding of copper or alumi-
nium wire, the machine is, at least in part, automatic. The pressure
is automatically applied and the welding current is cut off automat-
ically upon the completion of the joint; the placing of the pieces in
the clamps and the switching on of the current is, in this case, manu-
ally performed.

In other, more completely automatic, types, particularly adapted
for rapid repetition of the same operation on identical pieces, the
machine runs continuously, and its sequence of actions is definitely
determined by the construction. In such cases a source of power, as
by a belt, drives the machine, the movement so imparted having the
effect of clamping the pieces as they are fed to the machine, putting
on the current, applying the pressure, cutting off the current, and

releasing the pieces.
The mechanism which has been developed for these purposes dis-

plays, in many instances, much ingenuity. In these machines the
duty of the attendant is limited to the mere placing of the pieces
between the clamping jaws, just before they are clamped, and the
work is characterized by rapidity and by uniformity of the results.

More completely automatic still are machines for the production
of wire fencing and for the consecutive welding of the links of
chains. In these the operation, once started, goes on uninterruptedly
so long as the work holds out or until the stock undergoing opera-
tion is exhausted. In the fence machines, of which 15 are now in
existence, galvanized iron wires are fed from reels parailel to one
another, at distances apart depending on the mesh desired. These
may correspond to the warp in weaving. Transversely to these and
at intervals corresponding to the mesh selected are fed wires, cut
from a reel, which transverse wires are the verticals in the finished
fence itself and correspond to the weft in weaving. <A series of
small welders are automatically brought into operation to weld each
transverse wire to the longitudinals where the two cross. This done,
the web so formed moves forward, the operation repeats itself, and
so on continuously. The welding is in this case practically instan-
taneous, and all of the movements of the machine are entirely
automatic.

In this way it is possible for a single machine to turn out many
thousands of feet of fencing per day with a width of mesh from 2
or 3 inches up. Less wire is used than where the joints are made by
twists or loops, and the stability or fixedness of position’ of such
joints as are made is much more assured. Figure 1, plate 11, will
give some idea of the neatness of this product of the Neeine welding
loom.

While in most cases of electric welding the joint forms what is

known as a butt weld, with a burr or extension of metal at the joint,
which, according to conditions, is either allowed to remain or is
forged down or dressed off, there is no difficulty in making lap welds
electrically, and some of the recent work of the electric welder is of
that character. While, too, the usual welding concerns pieces of
the same metal, as iron to iron, steel to steel, or copper to copper,
combination welds of different metals are made with facility in many
cases, as when brass and iron are united.

In the working of high-carbon steels the usual precautions to
prevent burning or injury to the metal are, of course, required; but,
on account of the delicacy of heat control, they are more easily
adopted.

Quite recently automatic chain welders have been put into use, and
electrically-welded chain work will probably soon attain an impor-
tance not second to the other principal applications which have been
briefly described.

THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF
PHOTOGRAPH Y+

By Rosert HuNT.

A. HenrocrapHy—-THe Process or Monsreur NIepce.

Monsieur Niepce was the first inquirer who appears to have pro-
duced permanent pictures by the influence of the sun’s rays. This
process—heliography—is in many respects peculiar, which renders it
necessary, although his preparation was only acted on by an exposure
of many hours to full sunshine, to give a particular account of it;
the more so, as some points of considerable interest require further
elucidation.

The substance employed by Monsieur Niepce was asphaltum, or
bitumen of Judea. He thus directs its preparation: * I about half
fill a wineglass with this pulverized bitumen; I pour upon it, drop
by drop, the essential oil of lavender? until the bitumen is completely
saturated. I afterwards add as much more of the essential oil as
causes the whole to stand about three lines above the mixture, which
is then covered and submitted to a gentle heat until the essential oi] is
fully impregnated with the coloring matter of the bitumen. If this
varnish is not of the required consistency it must be allowed to evap-
orate slowly, without heat, in a shallow dish, care being taking to
protect it from moisture, by which it is injured, and at last decom-
posed. In winter or during rainy weather the precaution is doubly
necessary. A tablet of plated silver or well cleaned and warm glass
is to be highly polished, on which a thin coating of the varnish 1s to
be applied cold, with a light roll of very soft skin. This will impart
to it a fine vermilion color and cover it with a very thin and equal
coating. The plate is then placed upon heated iron, which is wrapped
around with several folds of paper, from which by this method all
moisture had been previously expelled. When the varnish has ceased
to simmer the plate is withdrawn from the heat and left to cool and

dry in a gentle temperature and protected from a damp atmosphere.
In this part of the operation a hght disk of metal with a handle in
the center should be held before the mouth in order to condense the
moisiure of the breath.”

The plate thus prepared is now in a fit state for use and may be
immediately fixed in the correct focus of the camera. After it has
been exposed a sufficient length of time for receiving the impression
a very faint outline alone is visible. The next operation is to bring
out the hidden picture, which is accomphshed by a solvent.

This solvent must be carefully adapted to the purposes for which it
is designed. It is diflicult to fix with certainty the proportions of its
components, but in all cases it is better that it be too weak than too
strong. In the former case the image does not come out strongly ; in
the latter it is completely destroyed. The solution is prepared of one
part—not by weight, but volume—of the essential oil of lavender,
poured upon ten parts, by measure also, of oil of white petroleum.
The mixture, which is first milky, becomes clear in two or three days.
This compound will act until it becomes saturated with the asphaltum,
which is readily distinguished by an opaque appearance and dark
brown color. <A tin vessel somewhat larger than the photographic
tablet and 1 inch deep must be provided. This is to have as much
of the solvent in it as will cover the plate. The tablet is plunged
into the solution, and the operator, observing it by reflected light,
begins to see the images of the objects to which it has been exposed
slowly unfolding their forms, though still veiled by the gradually
darkening supernatant fluid. The plate is then lfted out and held
in a vertical position till as much as possible of the solvent has been
allowed to drop away. When the dropping has ceased, we proceed to
the last, and not the least important, operation of washing the plate.

This is performed by carefully placing the tablet upon a board B (fig.
1), fixed at a large angle in the trough A A, the supports being joined
to it by hinges to admit of the neces-
sary changes of inclination under
different circumstances. Two small
blocks, not thicker than the tablet,
are fixed on the board on which the
plate rests. Water \must now be
slowly poured upon the upper part
of the board and allowed to flow
anne evenly over the surface of the pic-

1 ture. The descending stream clears

away all the solvent that may yet

adhere to the varnish. The plate is now to be dried with great care

by a gentle evaporation. To preserve the picture it is requisite to
cover it up from the action of light and protect it from humidity.

THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 289

_ The varnish may be apphed indifferently to metals, stone, or glass,
but Monsieur Niepce prefers copper plated with silver. To take
copies of engravings, a small quantity of wax is dissolved in essential
oul of lavender and added to the varnish already described. The en-
graving, first varnished over the back, is placed on the surface of the
prepared tablet, face toward it, and then exposed to the action of the
hight. In the camera obscura an exposure of from six to eight hours,
varying with the intensity of the light, is required; while from four
to six hours is necessary to produce a copy of an engraving. The
picture, in the first instance, is represented by the contrast between
the polished silver and the varnish coating. The discoverer after-
wards adopted a plan of darkening the silver by iodine, which ap-
pears to have led the way to Daguerre’s beautiful process. To darken
the tablet, it was placed in a box in which some iodine was strewed
and watched until the best effect was produced. The varnish was
afterwards removed by spirit of wine.

Of the use of glass plates Monsieur Niepee thus speaks:

Two experiments in landscape upon glass, by means of the camera, gave me
results which, although imperfect, appear deserving of notice, because this
variety of application may be brought more easily to perfection, and in the end
become a more interesting department of heliography.

In one of these trials the light acted in such a way that the varnish was
removed in proportion to the intensity with which the light had acted, and the
picture exhibited a more marked gradation of tone, so that, viewed by transniit-
ted light, the landscape produced, to a certain extent, the well-known effects of
the diorama.

In the second trial, on the contrary, the action of the luminous fluid having
been more intense, the parts acted upon by the strongest lights, not having
been attacked by the solvent, remained transparent. The difference of tone
resulted from the relative thickness of the coatings of varnish.

If this landscape is viewed by reflection in a mirror on the varnished side
and at a certain angle, the effect is remarkably striking, while, seen by a trans-
initted light, it is confused and shapeless, but what is equally surprising, in this
position the mimic tracery seems to affect the local color of the objects.

A statement that M. Niepce was enabled to engrave by hght went
the round of the press: but this does not appear to have been the
ease. All that the author of heliography effected was the etching of
the plate, after it had undergone its various processes, and the draw-
ing was completed by the action of nitric acid in the usual manner.
The parts of the copperplate protected by the varnish remained, of
course, unacted on, while the other parts were rapidly attacked by the
acid. Niepce remarks that his process can not be used during the
winter season, as the cold and moisture render the varnish brittle and
detach it from the glass or metal.

M. Niepce afterwards used a more unctuous varnish, composed of
bitumen of Judea dissolved in animal oil of Dippel. This composi-

tion 1s of much greater tenacity and higher color than the former,
and, after being apphed, it can immediately be submitted to the
action of the light, which appears to render it solid more quickly,
from the greater volatiity of the animal oil. M. Daguerre remarks
that this very properly diminishes still further the resources of the
process as respects the lights of the drawings thus obtained. These
processes of M. Niepce were much improved by M. Daguerre, who
makes the following remarks on the subject:

The substance which should be used in preference to bitumen is the residuum
obtained by evaporating the essential oil of lavender, which is to be dissolved in
alcohol and applied in an extremely thin wash. Although all bituminous and
resinous substances are, without any exception, endowed with the same prop-
erty—that of being affected by light—the preference ought to be given to those
which are the most unctuous, because they give greater firmness to the draw-
ings. Several essential oils lose this character when they are exposed to too
strong a heat.

It is not, however, from the ease with which it is decomposed that we are to
prefer the essential oil of lavender. There are, for instance, the resins, which,
being dissolved in alcohol and spread upon glass or metal, leave, by the evapo-
ration of the spirit, a very white and infinitely sensitive coating. But this
greater sensibility to light, caused by a quicker oxidation, renders also the
images obtained much more liable to injury from the agent by which they were
created. They grow faint and disappear altogether when exposed but for a few
months to the sun. The residuum of the essential oil of lavender is more
effectually fixed, but even this is not altogether uninfluenced by the eroding
effects of a direct exposure to the sun’s light.

The essence is evaporated in a shallow dish by heat till the resinous residuum
acquires such a consistency that when cold it rings on being struck with the
point of a knife, and flies off in pieces when separated from the dish. A small
quantity of this material is afterwards to be dissolved in alcohol or ether; the
solution formed should be transparent and of a Jemon-yellow color. The clearer
the solution the more delicate will be the coating on the plate. It must not,
however, be too thin, because it would not thicken or spread out into a white
coat, indispensable requisites for obtaining good effects in photographic designs.
I'he use of the alcohol or ether is to facilitate the application of the resin under
a very attenuated form, the spirit being entirely evaporated before the light
effects its delineations on the tablet. In order to obtain greater vigor the metal
ought to have an exquisite polish. There is more charm about sketches taken
on glass plates, and, above all, much greater delicacy.

sefore commencing operations the experimenter must carefully clean his
glass or metal plate. For this purpose emery reduced to an impalpable powder
mixed with alcohol may be used, applying it by means of cotton wool, but this
part of the process must always be concluded by dry polishing, that no trace of
moisture may remain on the tablet. The plate of metal or glass being thus pre-
pared, in order to supply the wash or coating it is held in one hand and with
the other the solution is to be poured over it from a flask or bottle having a
wide mouth, so that it may flow rapidly and cover the whole surface. It is at
first necessary to hold the plate a little inclined, but as soon as the solution
is poured on and has ceased to flow freely it is raised perpendicularly. The
finger is then passed behind and below the plate in order to draw off a portion
of the liquid, which, tending always to ascend, would double the thickness of
the covering. ‘The finger must be wiped each time, and be passed very rapidly

along the whole length of the plate from below and on the side opposite the
coating. When the liquid has ceased to run, the plate is dried in the dark. The
coating being well dried it. is to be placed in the Gamera obscura. The time
required to procure a photographic Copy of a landscape is from seven to eight
hours, but single monuments strongly illuminated by the sun or very bright in
themselves are copied in about three hours.

When operating on glass it is necessary, in order to increase the light, to
place the plate upon a piece of paper, with great care that the connection is
perfect over every part, as otherwise confusion is produced in the design by
imperfect reflection.

It frequently happens that when the plate is removed from the camera there
is no trace of any image upon its surface. It is therefore necessary to use an-
other process to bring out the hidden design.

To do this, provide a tin vessel larger than the tablet, having all around a
ledge or border 50 mm. (2 English inches) in depth. Let this be three-
fourths full of the oil of petroleum. Fix your tablet by the back to a piece of
wood which completely covers the vessel and place it so that the tablet, face
downwards, is over but not touching the oil. The vapor of the petroleum pene-
trates the coating of the plate in those parts on which the light has acted
feebly—that is, in the portions which correspond to the shadows—imparting to
them a transparency as if nothing were there. On the contrary, the points of
the resinous coating on which light has acted, having been rendered impervious
to the vapor, remain unchanged.

The design.must be examined from time to time and withdrawn as soon as
a vigorous effect is obtained. By urging the action too far even the strongest
lights will be attacked by the vapor and disappear, to the destruction of the
piece.

It may perhaps appear to some that I have needlessly given the
particulars of a process, now superseded by others, possessing the
most infinite sensibility, producing in a few minutes a better effect
than was obtained by the hehographic process in several hours.
There are, however, so many curious facts connected with the action
of light on these resins that no treatise on photography could be
considered complete without some description of them: and this
process 1s now revived with a view to the production of etchings
directly from nature.

M. Daguerre remarks that numerous experiments tried by him
with these resinous preparations of M. Niepce prove that light can
not fall upon a body without leaving traces of decomposition; and
they also demonstrate that these bodies possess the power of renewing
in darkness what has been lost by luminous action, provided total
decomposition has not been effected. This heliographic process must
be regarded as the earliest successful attempt at fixing on solid tablets
the images of the camera obscura and at developing a dormant image.

.
On the 31st of January, 1839, six months prior to the publication of
M. Daguerre’s process, Mr. Fox Talbot communicated to the Royal
Society his photographic discoveries, and in February he gave to the
292 THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

world an account of the process he had devised for preparing a sensi-
tive paper for photographie drawings. In the memoir read before
the Royal Society he states:

‘In the spring of 1834 I began to put in practice a method which I had devised
some time previously for employing to purposes of utility the very curious
property which has been long known to chemists to. be possessed by nitrate of
silver, namely, its discoloration when exposed to the violet rays of light.¢

From this it appears that the English philosopher had pursued his
researches ignorant of what had been done by others on the Continent.
It is not necessary to enlarge in this place on the merits of the two
discoveries of Talbot and Daguerre, but it may be well to show the
kind of sensitiveness to which Mr. Talbot had arrived at this early
period in his preparations, which will be best done by a brief extract
from his own communication.

“Tt is so natural,” says this experimentalist, “to associate the
idea of labor with great complexity and elaborate detail of execution
that one is struck more at seeing the thousand florets of an agrostis
depicted with all its capillary branchlets (and so accurately that
none of all this multitude shall want its little bivalve calyx, requir-
ing to be examined through a lens), than one is by the large and
simple leaf of an oak or a chestnut. But in truth the difficulty is in
hoth cases the same. The one of these takes no more time to execute
than the other; for the object which would take the most skilful
artist days or weeks of labor to trace or to copy is affected by the
boundless powers of natural chemistry in the space of a few seconds.”
And again, “to give some more definite idea of the rapidity of the
process, I will state that after various trials the nearest valuation
which I could make of the time necessary for obtaining the picture
of an object so as to have pretty distinct outlines, when I employed
the full sunshine, was half a second.” This is to be understood of
the paper then used by Mr. Talbot for taking objects by means of
the solar microscope.

In the Philosophical Magazine, Mr. Fox Talbot published the
first account of his photogenic experiments. The term was intro-
duced by this gentleman, and his experiments can not be better
described than in his own words:

In order to make what may be called ordinary photogenic paper, I select, in
the first place, paper of a good firm quality and smooth surface. I do not know
that anything answers better than superfine writing paper. I dip it into a weak
solution of common salt and wipe it dry, by which the salt is uniformly distrib-
uted throughout its substance. I then spread the solution of nitrate of silver
on one surface only, and dry it at the fire. The solution should not be saturated,
but six or eight times diluted with water. When dry the paper is fit for use._

I have found by experiment that there is a certain proportion between the

THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 293

quantity of salt and that of the solution of silver which answers best and
gives the maximum effect. If the strength of the salt is augmented beyond
this point the effect diminishes, and, in certain cases, becomes exceedingly
small,

This paper, if properly made, is very useful for all photographic purposes.
For example, nothing can be more perfect than the images it gives of leaves
and flowers, especially with a summer sun, the light passing through the leaves
delineates every ramification of their nerves.

Now, suppose we take a sheet thus prepared and wash it with a saturated
solution of salt and then dry it. We shall find (especially if the paper is kept
some weeks before trial is made) that its sensibility is greatly diminished, and
in some cases seems quite extinct. But if it is again washed with a liberal
quantity of the solution of silver, it becomes again sensible to light, and even
more so than it was at first. In this way, by alternately washing the paper
with salt and silver, and drying it between times, I have succeeded in increas-
ing its sensibility to the degree that is requsite for receiving the images of the
camera obscura.

In conducting this operation it will be found that the results are sometimes
more and sometimes less satisfactory in consequence of small and accidental
yariations in the proportions employed. It happens sometimes that the chloride
of silver is disposed to draken of itself without any exposure to light. ‘This
shows that the attempt to give it sensibility has been carried too far. The object
is to approach to this condition as near as possible without reaching it, so that
the substance may be in a state ready to yield to the slightest extraneous force,
such as the feeble impact of the violet rays when much attenuated. Having,
therefore, prepared a number of sheets of paper with chemical proportions
slightly different from one another. let a piece be cut from each, and, having
been duly marked or numbered, let them be placed side by side in a very weak
diffused light for a quarter of an hour. Then, if any one of them, as frequently
happens, exhibits a marked advantage over its competitors, I select the paper
which bears the corresponding number to be placed in the ‘camera obscura.

The increased sensitiveness given to paper by alternate ablutions
of saline and argentine washes, the striking differences of effect pro-
duced by accidental variations of the proportions in which the chem-
ical ingredients are applied, and the spontaneous change which takes
place, even in the dark, on the more sensitive varieties of the paper,
are all subjects of great interest, which demand further investiga-
tion than they have ever yet received, and which, if followed out,
promise some most important explanations of chemcial phenomena
at present involved in uncertainty, particularly those which appear
to show the influence of time, an element not sufficiently taken into
account, in overcoming the weaker affinities. Few fields of research
promise a greater measure of reward than these. Already the art
of making sun pictures has led to many very important physical dis-
coveries, but most of the phenomena are yet involved in obscurity.

C. DacurrReotyPr-—THr Discovery or M. DaGurErREe.

Tt has already been stated that Niepce and Daguerre, having by
accident discovered they were prosecuting experiments of the same
kind, entered into partnership. On the 5th of December, 1829,
294 THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

Niepce communicated to Daguerre the particulars of the process
employed by him, which has been already described (Chap. IT) urder
the term “ hehography.” Niepce died in July, 1833, but he has left
some letters which clearly show that he had been a most industrious
investigator. One extract appears of particular importance. “I re-
peat it, sir,” he says, “ I do not see that we can hope to derive any
advantage from this process (the use of iodine) more than from any
other method which depends upon the use of metallic oxides,” ete.
Again, he says, “a decoction of Thlaspi (Shepherd’s purse), fumes
of phosphorus, and particularly of sulphur, as acting on silver in the
same way as lodine, and caloric, produce the same effects by oxidizing
the metal, for from this cause proceeded in all these instances their
extreme sensibilitly to hght. After the death of M. Nicephore Niepce
a new agreement was entered into between his son, M. Isidore Niepce,
and Daguerre that they should pursue their investigations, in common
and share the profits, whatever they might eventually prove to be.

The discovery of Daguerre was reported to the world early in Jan-
uary, 1839, but the process by which his beautiful pictures were pro-
duced was not made known until the July following, after a bill was
passed securing to himself a pension for life of 6,000 francs, and to
M. Isidore Niepce, the son of Monsieur Niepce above mentioned, a
pension for life of 4,000 frances, with one-half in reversion to their
widows. It was regretted that after the French Government had
thus liberally purchased the secret of the process of the daguerreo-
type for “the glory of endowing the world of science and art with
one of the most surprising discoveries that honor their native land,”
on the argument that “the invention did not admit of being secured
by patent, for as soon as published all might avail themselves of its
advantages,” that its author should have guarded it by a patent right
in England.

From the primary importance of this very beautiful branch of the
photographic art I shall devote some space to a description of the
original process, reserving for the division devoted to the manipula-
tory details the description of each improvement which has been pub-
lished having any practical advantage, either by lessening the labor
required or reducing the expense.

The pictures of the daguerreotype are executed upon thin sheets
of silver plated on copper. Although the copper serves principally
to support the silver foil, the combination of the two metals appears
to tend to the perfection of the effect. It is essential that the silver
should be very pure. The thickness of the copper should be sufficient
to maintain perfect flatness and a smooth surface, so that the images
may not be distorted by any warping or unevenness. Unnecessary
thickness is to be avoided on account of the weight.

The process is divided by Daguerre into five operations. . The first

consists in cleaning and polishing the plate to fit it for receiving the
sensitive coating on which the light forms the picture. The second
is the formation of the sensitive ioduret of silver over the face of the
tablet. The third is the adjusting of the plate in the camera obscura
for the purpose of receiving the impression. The fourth is the bring-
ing out of the photographic picture, which is invisible when the plate
is taken from the camera. The fifth and last operation is to remove
the sensitive coating, and thus prevent that susceptibility of change
under luminous influence which would otherwise exist and quickly
destroy the picture.

First operation.—A small phial of olive oil, some finely carded cot-
ton, a muslin bag of finely levigated pumice, a phial of nitric acid,
diluted in the proportion of 1 part of acid to 16 parts of water, are
required for this operation. The operator must also provide himself
with a small spirit lamp and an iron-wire frame, upon which the
plate is to be placed while being heated over the lamp.

The plate being first powdered over with pumice, by shaking the
bag, a piece of cotton dipped into the olive oil is then carefully
rubbed over it with a continuous circular motion, commencing from
the center. When the plate is well polished, it must be cleaned by
powdering it well over with pumice and then rubbing it with dry
cotton, always rounding and crossing the strokes, it being impossible
to obtain a true surface by any other motion of the hand. The sur-
face of the plate is now rubbed all over with a pledget of cotton,
shghtly wetted with the diluted nitric acid. Frequently change the
cotton and keep rubbing briskly that the acid may be equally dif-
fused over the silver, as, if it is permitted to run into drops, it stains

the table. It will be seen when the
acid has been properly diffused
from the appearance of a thin film
equally spread over the surface.
It is then to be cleaned off with a
little pumice and dry cotton.

The plate is now placed on the
wire frame, the silver upward, and
the spirit lamp held in the hand
and moved about below it, so that
the flame plays upon the copper.
This is continued for five minutes,

9. when a white coating is formed all

over the surface of the silver: the

lamp is then withdrawn. A charcoal fire may be used instead
of the lamp. The plate is now cooled suddenly by placing it on a
mass of metal or a stone floor. When perfectly cold it is again
polished with dry cotton and pumice. It is necessary that acid be

296 THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

again applied two or three times in the manner before directed, the
dry pumice being powdered over the plate each time and polished
off gently with dry cotton. Care must be taken not to breathe upon
the plate or touch it with the fingers, for the slightest stain upon the
surface will be a defect in the drawing. It is indispensable that the
last operation with the acid be performed imme-
diately before it is intended for use. Let every
particle of dust be removed by cleaning all the
edges, and the back also, with cotton. After
the first polishing the plate C is fixed on a
board by means of four fillets, B B B B, of
plated copper. (Fig. 3.) To each of these are
3. soldered two small projecting pieces, which
hold the tablet near the corners; and the whole
is retained in a proper position by means of screws, as represented
at DDD:

Second operation.—lIt is necessary for this operation, which is

really the most important of all, that a box similar to figures 4 and 5
ve provided. Figure 4 represents a section supposed to pass down
the middle of the apparatus by the line A B in figure 5, which repre-
sents the box as seen from above. C is a small lid which accurately
fits the interior and divides the boxes into two chambers. It is kept
constantly in its place when the box is not in use, the purpose of it
being to concentrate the vapor of the todine that it may act more
readily upon the plate when it is exposed to it. D is the little cap-
sule in which the iodine is placed, which is covered with the ring J,
upon which is stretched a piece of fine gauze, by which the particles
ef iodine are prevented from rising and staining the plate, while the
vapor, of course, passes freely through it. E is the board with the
plate attached, which rests on the four smaller projecting pieces F’,

figure 5. G is the lid of the box, which is kept closed, except when
the plate is removed or inserted. H represents the supports for the
cover C; K K, tapering sides all round, forming a funnel-shaped box
within.

To prepare the plate: The cover C being taken out, the cup D is
charged with a sufficient quantity of iodine, broken into small pieces,
and covered with the gauze J. The board E is now, with the plate
attached, placed face downward in its proper position and the box
carefully closed.

In this position the plate remains until the vapor of the iodine has
produced a definite golden-yellow color—nothing more or less. If
the operation is prolonged beyond the point at which this effect 1s
produced, a violet color is assumed, which is much less sensitive to
light, and if the yellow coating is too pale the picture produced will
prove very faint in all its parts. The time for this can not be fixed,
as it depends entirely on the temperature of the surrounding air. No
artificial heat must be apphed, unless in the case of elevating the
temperature of an apartment in which the operation may be going on.
It is also important that the temperature of the inside of the box
should be the same as it is without, as otherwise a deposition of
moisture is lable to take place over the surface of the plate. It is
well to leave a portion of the iodine always in the box, for, as it is
slowly vaporized, it is absorbed by the wood, and when required it
is given out over the more extended surface more equally and with
greater rapidity.

As, according to the season of the year, the time for producing
the required effect may vary from five minutes to half an hour or
more, it 1s necessary, from time to time, to inspect the plate. This
is also necessary to see if the iodine is acting equally on every part
of the silver, as it sometimes happens that the color is sooner pro-
duced on one side than on the other, and the plate, when such is the
case, must be turned one quarter round. The plate must be inspected
in a darkened room, to which a faint light is admitted in some indi-
rect way, as by a door a little open. The board being lifted from the
box with both hands, the operator turning the plate toward him
rapidly, observes the color. If too pale, it must be returned to the
box; but if it has assumed the violet color it is useless, and the whole
process must be again gone through.

From description, this operation may appear very difficult, but
with a little practice the precise interval necessary to produce the
best effect is pretty easily guessed at. When the proper yellow color
is produced, the plate must be put into a frame, which fits the camera
obscura, and the doors are instantly closed upon it to prevent the

access of light. The figures represent this frame, figure 6, with the

until the moment when the plate is required for use. The third

operation should, if possible, immediately succeed the second. . The
longest interval between them should not exceed an hour, as the
iodine and silver lose their requisite photogenic properties. It is
necessary to observe that the iodine ought never to be touched with
the fingers, as we are very hable to injure the plate by touching it
with the hands thus stained.

Third operation—The third operation is the fixing of the plate at

placing the camera itself

(SS Wa See,

a :

After having placed the camera in
front of the landscape or any object of
which we desire the representation, our
first attention must be to adjust the
plate at such a distance from the lens
that a neat and sharply defined picture
is produced. This is, of course, done by
the obscured glass. The adjustment being
satisfactorily made the glass is removed
and its place supplied by the frame con-

% taining the prepared plate, and the

whole secured by screws. The doors are

now opened by means of the half circles and the plate exposed to
receive the picture. The length of time necessary for the production
of the best effect, varying with the quantity of light, is a matter
which requires the exercise of considerable judgment, particularly as
no impression is visible upon the tablet when it is withdrawn from
the camera. At Paris this varies from three to thirty minutes. The
most favorable time is from 7 to 8 o’clock. A drawing which in the
months of June and July may be taken in three or four minutes will
require five or six in May or August, seven or eight in April or
September, and so on, according to the season. Objects in shadow,
even during the brightest weather, will require twenty minutes to
be correctly delineated. From what has been stated it will be evident
that it is impossible to fix with any precision the exact length of
time necessary to obtain photographic designs, but by practice. we
soon learn to calculate the required time with considerable correct-
ness. The latitude is, of course, a fixed element in this calculation.
In the sunny climes of Italy and southern France these designs may
be obtained much more promptly. than in the uncertain climate of
Great Britain. It is very important that the time necessary is not
exceeded—prolonged solarization has the effect of blackening the

plate, and this destroys the clearness of the design. If the operator
has failed in his first experiment, let him immediately commence
with another plate; correcting the second trial by the first he will
seldom fail to reproduce a good photograph.

Fourth operation—The apparatus required in this operation is
represented by figure 10. A is the lid of the box; B,a blackboard with
grooves to receive the plate; C, cup con-
taining a little mercury (J); D. spirit
lamp; IF, thermometer; G, glass
through which to inspect the operation;
H, tablet as removed from the camera;
I, stand for the spirit lamp. All the
interior of this apparatus should be cov-
ered with hard, black varnish. The
board and the affixed plate being with-
drawn from the camera are placed at an
angle of about 45° within this box, the
tablet with the picture downward, so
that it may be seen through the glass G.
The box being carefully closed, the
spirit lamp is to be hghted and placed
under the cup contaiming the mercury.
The heat is to be apphed until the ther-
mometer, the bulb of which is covered
with the mercury, indicates a tempera-
ture of 60° C. (140° F.). The lamp is then withdrawn, and if the
thermometer has risen rapidly, it will continue to rise without the
aid of the lamp, but the elevation ought not to be allowed to exceed
75° C. (167° F.).

After a few minutes the image of nature impressed, but now in-
visible, on the plate begins to appear. The operator assures himself
of the progress of this development by examining the picture through
the glass G, by a taper, taking care that the rays do not fall too
strongly on the plate and injure the nascent images. The opera-
tion is continued till the thermometer sinks to 45° C. (113° F.).
When the objects have been strongly illuminated, or when the plate
has been kept in the camera too long, it will be found that this
operation is completed before the thermometer has fallen to 55° C.
(181° F.). This is, however, always known by observing the sketch

through the glass.

After each operation the apparatus is carefully cleaned in every
part, and in particular the strips of metal which hold the plate
are well rubbed with pumice and water to remove the adhering
THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 301

mercury and iodine. The plate may now be deposited in the grooved
box (fig. 11), in which it may be kept, excluded from the light,
until it is convenient to perform the last fixing operation.

Fifth operation.—This process has for its object the removal of
the iodine from the plate of silver, which prevents
the further action of the light.

A saturated solution of common salt may be used
for this purpose, but it does not answer nearly so
well as a weak solution of the hyposulphite of soda.
In the first place the plate is to be placed in a trough
of water, plunging and withdrawing it immediately ;
it is then to be plunged into one of the above saline
solutions, which would act upon the drawing if it

lL. was not previously hardened by washing in water.
To assist the effect of the saline washes, the plate
must be moved to and fro, which is best done by passing a wire be-
neath the plate. When the yellow color has quite disappeared the
plate is lifted out, great care being taken that the impression is not
touched, and it is again plunged into water. <A vessel of warm dis-

tilled water, or very pure rain water boiled and cooled, being pro-
vided, the plate is fixed on an inclined plane and the water is poured
in a continuous stream over the picture. The drops of water which
may remain upon the plate must be removed by forcibly blowing
upon it, for otherwise, in drying, they would leave stains on the
drawings. This finishes the drawing, and it only remains to pre-
serve the silver from tarnishing and from dust.

The shadows in the daguerreotype pictures are represented by
the polished surface of the silver, and the hghts by the adhering
mercury, which will not bear the shghtest rubbing. To preserve
these sketches they must be placed in cases of pasteboard with a
glass cover over them and then framed in wood. They are now
unalterable by the sun’s hght.

The same plate may be employed for many successive trials, pro-
vided the silver be not polished through to the copper. It is very
important, after each trial, that the mercury be removed immedi-
ately by polishing with pumice powder and oil. If this be neg-
lected the mercury finally adheres to the silver, and good drawings
can not be obtained if this amalgam is present.

D. Tur CaLoryrer.

Early in 1840 drawings on paper were handed about in the
scientific circles of London and of Paris, which were a great advance
upon anything which had been previously done. ‘These were the
results of a new process discovered by Mr. Talbot, and then at-
tracted so much attention that Monsieur Biot made them the subject
302 THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

of a communication to the Academy of Sciences in Paris. His re-
marks were printed in extenso in the Comptes Rendus.

Mr. Talbot’s description of his process, the patent for which is
dated 1841, is as follows: ¢

Take a sheet of the best writing paper, having a smooth surface
and a close and even texture. The watermark, if any, should be
cut off lest it should injure the appearance of the picture. Dis-
solve 100 grains of crystallized nitrate of silver in 6 ounces of dis-
tilled water. Wash the paper with this solution with a soft brush
on one side, and put a mark on that side, whereby to know it again.
Dry the paper cautiously at a distance from the fire, or else let
it dry spontaneously in a dark room. When dry, or nearly ‘so, dip
it into a solution of iodide of potassium, containing 500 grains of
that salt dissolved in one pint of water, and let it stay two or three
minutes in the solution. Then dip the paper into a vessel of water,
dry it hgbtly with blotting paper, and finish drying it at a fire,
which will not injure it even if held pretty near; or else it may be
left to dry spontaneously. All this is best done in the evening by
randlelight. The paper, so far prepared, is called iodized paper,
because it has a uniform pale-yellow coating of iodide of silver. It
is scarcely sensitive to light, but nevertheless it ought to be kept
in a portfolio or drawer until wanted for use. It may be kept for
any length of time without spoiling or undergoing any change, if
protected from sunshine. When the paper is required for use take a
sheet of it and wash it witha liquid prepared in the following manner:

Dissolve 100 grains of crystallized nitrate of silver in 2 ounces of
distilled water; add to this solution one-sixth of its volume of strong
acetic acid. Let this be called mixture A.

Make a saturated solution of crystallized gallic acid in cold dis-
tilled water. The quantity dissolved is very small. Call this solu-
tion B.

Mix together the liquids A and B. in equal volumes, but only a
small quantity of them at a time, because the mixture does not keep
long without spoiling. This mixture Mr. Talbot calls the gallo-
nitrate of silver. This solution must be washed over the iodized
paper on the side marked, and being allowed to remain upon it for
half a minute, it must be dipped into water, and then lightly dried
with blotting paper. This operation in particular requires the exclu-
sion of daylight ; and although the paper thus prepared has been found
to keep for two or three months, it is advisable to use it within a few
hours, as it is often rendered useless by spontaneous change in the dark.

aMr. Talbot, by a letter in the Times of August 18, 1852, gives to the public
the right of using any of his patents for any purpose not involving the produc-
tion of portraits from life,

THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 308

Paper thus prepared is exquisitely sensitive to hght, an exposure
of less than a second to diffused daylight being quite sufficient to set
up the process of change. If a piece of this paper is partly covered
and the other exposed to daylight for the briefest possible period of
time, a very decided impression will be made. This impression 1s
latent and invisible. If, however, the paper be placed aside in the
dark, it will gradually develop itself; or it may be brought out im-
mediately by being washed over with the gallo-nitrate of silver, and
held at a short distance from the fire, by which the exposed portions
become brown, the covered parts remaining of their original color.
The pictures being thus procured, are to be fixed by washing in clean
water and lightly drying between blotting paper, after which they
are to be washed over with a solution of bromide of potassium con-
taining 100 grains of that salt dissolved in 8 or 10 ounces of water ;
after a minute or two it is again to be dipped into water, and then
finally dried.

Such was, in all its main features, the description given by Mr.
Talbot in his specification of his process for producing the calotype,
or beautiful picture (as the term signifies). He, in a second patent,
included the points stated in the next section.

SECTION III. IMPROVEMENTS IN CALOTYPE.

Such is the term employed by Mr. Talbot, and these improvements
consist of the following particulars, constituting that gentleman’s
second claim:

1. Removing the yellowish tint which is occasioned by the 1odide
of silver from the paper by plunging it into a hot bath of hyposul-
phite of soda dissolved in ten times its weight of water and heated
nearly to the boiling point. The picture should remain in the bath
about ten minutes and be then washed in warm water and dried.

Although this has been included by Mr. Talbot in his specifica-
tion, he has clearly no claim to it, since in February, 1840, Sir John
Herschel published, in his memoir “On the chemical action’ of the
rays of the solar spectrum,” a process of fixing with the hot hyposul-
phite of soda.

After undergoing the operation of fixing the picture is placed upon
a hot iron and wax melted into the pores of the paper to increase
its transparency.

2. The calotype paper is rendered more sensitive by placing a
warm iron behind in the camera while the light is acting upon it.

3. The preparation of i0-gallic paper, which is simply washing a
sheet of iodized paper with gallic acid. In this state it will keep in
a portfolio, and is rendered sensitive to light by washing it over
with a solution of nitrate of silver.

4. Iodized paper is washed with a mixture of 26 parts of saturated

Y
304 THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

solution of gallic acid to 1 part of the solution of nitrate of sulver
ordinarily used. It can then be dried without fear of spoiling, may
be kept a little time, and used without further preparation.

5. The improvement of photographic drawings by exposing them
twice the usual time to the action of sunlight. The shadows are thus
rendered too dark and the lights are not sufficiently white. The
drawing is then washed and plunged into a bath of iodide of
potassium of the strength of 500 grains to each pint of water and
allowed to remain in it for one or two minutes, which makes the
pictures brighter and its lights assume a pale-yellow tint. After this
it is washed and immersed in a hot bath of hyposulphite of soda
until the pale-yellow tint is removed and the lights remain quite
white. The pictures thus finished have a pleasing and peculiar effect.

6. The appearance of photographic pictures is improved by wax-
ing them and placing white or colored paper behind them.

7. Enlarged copies of daguerreotypes and calotypes can be obtained
by throwing magnified images of them, by means of lenses, upon
calotype paper.

8. Photographic printing. A few pages of letterpress are printed
on one side only of a sheet of paper, which is waxed if thought
necessary, and the letters are cut out and sorted; then, in order to
compose a new page, a sheet of white paper is ruled with straight
lines and the words are formed by cementing the separate letters in
their proper order along the lines. A negative photographic copy
is then taken, having white letters on a black ground; this is fixed,
and any number of positive copies can be obtained. Another method
proposed by the patentee is to take a copy by the camera obscura from
large letters painted on a white board.

9. Photographic publication. This claim of the patentee consists
in making, first, good negative drawings on papers prepared with
salt and ammonio-nitrate of silver; secondly, fixing them by the
process above described ; thirdly, the formation of positive drawings
from the negative copy, and fixing.

These claims, taken from the specification as published in the
Repertory of Patent Inventions, are preserved in their original form
for the purpose of showing how much that is now fully accomplished
was foreseen by Mr. Talbot as the result of his discoveries.

SECTION IV. PICTURES ON PORCELAIN TABLETS.

A third patent has been obtained by Mr. Talbot, mainly involving
the use of porcelain as a substitute for glass, and contains some useful
facts noticed by Mr. Malone.

The first part of the patentee’s invention consists in the use of
plates of unglazed porcelain to receive the photographic image. A
plate intended for photographic purposes should be made of the finest
THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 805

materials employed by the manufacturers of porcelain; it should
also be flat, very thin, and-semitransparent; if too thin, so that there
would be a chance of breaking, it may be attached by means of cement
to a piece of glass to give it strength. The substance of the plate
should be shghtly porous, so as to enable it to imbibe and retain a
sufficient quantity of the chemical solutions employed. To prepare
the plate for use, it is first required to give it a coating of albumen, or
white of eggs, laid on very evenly, and then gently dried at a fire.
According as the plate is more or less porous, it requires more or less
of the albuminous coating; it is best to employ a very close-grained
porcelain, which requires but little white of egg. The prepared
plate may be made sensitive to light in the same way in which a sheet
of paper is rendered sensitive; and we generally find the same
methods applicable for photographic pictures on paper applicable
to those on porcelain plates, and one of the processes employed by the
patentee is nearly the same as that patented by Mr. Talbot in 1841.

The prepared plate is dipped into a solution of nitrate of silver
made by dissolving 25 grains of nitrate in 1 ounce of water; or the
solution is spread over the plate uniformly with a brush. The plate
is then dried, afterwards dipped into a solution of iodide of potas-
sium of the strength of about 25 grains of iodide to 1 ounce of water,
again dried, and the surface rubbed clean and smooth with cotton.
The plate is now of a pale-yellow color, owing to the formation on
the surface of iodide of silver... The plate, prepared as above di-
rected, may be kept in this state until required, when it is to be ren-
dered sensitive to light by washing it over with a solution of gallo-
nitrate of silver, then placed in the camera; and the image obtained
is to be rendered visible and sufficiently strengthened by another
washing of the same quid, aided by gentle warmth. The negative
picture thus obtained is fixed by washing it with water, then with
bromide of potassium, or, what is still better, hyposulphite of soda,
and again several times in water. The plate of porcelain being sem1-
transparent, positive pictures can be obtained from the above-men-
tioned negative ones by copying them in a copying frame.

The picture obtained on porcelain can be altered or modified in
appearance by the application of a strong heat, a process not appli-
cable to pictures taken on paper. With respect to this part of their
invention, the patentees claim:

The obtaining by means of a camera or copying frame photographie images
or pictures upon slabs or plates of porcelain.

The second part relates to the process which has been discovered
and improved upon by Mr. Malone, who is associated with Mr. Fox
Talbot in the patent. The patentees’ improvement is a method of
obtaining more complete fixation of photographic pictures on paper.

SM 1904——20
306 THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

For this purpose the print, after undergoing the usual fixing proc-
ess, is dipped into a boiling solution of strong caustic potash, which
changes the color of the print, and usually, after a certain time, ac-
quires something of a greenish tint, which indicates that the process
is terminated.

The picture is then well washed and dried, and if the tint acquired
by it is not pleasing to the eye a slight exposure to the vapors of sul-
phureted hydrogen will restore to it an agreeable brown or sepia
tint. Under this treatment the picture diminishes in size, insomuch
that if it were previously cut in two and one part submitted to the
potash process and the other not, the two halves when afterwards
put together would be found not to correspond. The advantages of
this process for removing any iodine which, even after fixing with
the hyposulphite, remains in the paper is great, and it will tend much
to preserve these beautiful transcripts of nature.

The patentee also claims as an improvement on the use of var-
nished or other transparent paper impervious to water, as a sub-
stitute for glass in certain circumstances, to support a film of albu-
men for photographic purposes. A sheet of writing paper is brushed
over with several coats of varnish on each side; it thus becomes
extremely transparent. It is then brushed over on one side with
albumen, or a mixture of albumen and gelatin and dried. ‘This
film of albumen is capable of being rendered sensitive to hght by
exposing it to the vapour of iodine, and by following the process
indicated in the preceding section of this specification. The ad-
vantages of using varnished or oil paper do not consist in any su-
periority of the images over those obtained upon glass, but in the
greater convenience of using paper than glass in cases where a large
number of pictures have to be made and carried about for consid-
erable distances; besides this, there is a well-known kind of photo-
graphic pictures giving panoramic views of scenery which are pro-
duced upon a curved surface by a movement of the object glass
of the camera. To the production of these images glass is hardly
applicable, since it can not be readily bent to the required curve and
again straightened; but the case is met by employing talc, varnished
paper, oiled paper, etc., instead of glass. It will be seen that the
varnished, paper acts as a support to the film of albumen or gelatin,
which is the surface on which the light acts and forms the picture.
The next improvement consists in forming photographic pictures
or images on the surfaces of polished steel plates. For this purpose
one part (by measure) of a standard solution of iodide of potassium
is mixed with 200 parts of albumen, and spread as evenly as possible
upon the surface of a steel plate and dried by the heat of a gentle
fire. The plate is then taken, and, while still warm, is washed over
with an alcoholic solution of gallo-nitrate of silver of moderate
THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY. 807

strength. It then becomes very sensitive and easily receives a photo-
graphic image. If the plate be cold, the sensibility is considerably
lower. The image obtained is-fixed by washing with hyposulphate
of soda and finally with water.

SECTION V. INSTANTANEOUS PROCESS.

The next invention and patent of Mr. Fox Talbot possesses many
peculiarities, and as the results are of a remarkable character it is
important that the process should be given uncurtailed in its main
particulars. The following description must be regarded as an
abstract of Mr. Talbot’s communication to the Athenzeum Decem-
ber 6, 1851. An experiment was tried in June, at the Royal Institu-
tion, in which an instantaneous image was produced; but as the
process was the subject of another patent it was not published until
the above date. The experiment in question was that of obtaining
a photographic copy of a printed paper fastened to a wheel, which
was made to revolve as rapidly as possible, by illuminating it for
a moment by the light obtained from the discharge of a Leyden
battery. The bill was faithfully printed, not even a letter being
indistinct.

A glass plate is employed, and Mr. Talbot thus directs that it
should be prepared :

1. Take the most hquid portion of the white of an egg, rejecting
the rest. Mix it with an equal quantity of water. * Spread it very
evenly upon a plate of glass, and dry it at the fire. A strong heat
may be used without injuring the plate. The film of dried albumen
ought to be uniform and nearly invisible.

2. To an aqueous solution of nitrate of silver add a considerable
quantity of alcohol, so that an ounce of the mixture may contain 3
grains of the nitrate. I have tried various proportions, from 1 to 6
grains, but perhaps 3 grains answer the best. More experiments are
here required, since the results are much influenced by this part of the
process.

3. Dip the plate into this solution, and then let it dry spontaneously.
Faint prismatic colors will then be seen upon the plate. It is impor-
tant to remark that the nitrate of silver appears to form a true chem-
ical combination with the albumen, rendering it much harder and
insoluble in liquids which dissolved it previously.

4. Wash with distilled water to remove any superfluous portion of
the nitrate of silver. Then give the plate a second coating of albu-
men, similar to the first, but in drying avoid heating it too much,
which would cause a commencement of decomposition of the silver.

5. To an aqueous solution of proto-iodide of iron add, first, an
equal volume of acetic acid, and then 10 volumes of alcohol. Allow
the mixture to repose two or three days. At the end of that time
808 THE HISTORY OF SOME DISCOVERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

it will have changed color, and the odor of acetic acid, as welk as
that of alcohol, will have disappeared, and the liquid will have
acquired a peculiar but agreeable vinous odor. It is in this state that
I prefer to employ it.

6. Into the iodide thus prepared and modified the plate is dipped
for a few seconds. All these operations may be performed by moder-
ate daylight, avoiding, however, the direct solar rays.

7. A solution is made of nitrate of silver, containing about 70 grains
to 1 ounce of water. To 3 parts of this add 2 of acetic acid. Then,
if the prepared plate is rapidly dipped once or twice into this solu-
tion, it acquires a very great degree of sensibility, and it ought then
to be placed in the camera without much delay.

8. The plate is withdrawn from the camera, and in order to bring
out the image it is dipped into a solution of protosulphate of iron
containing 1 part of the saturated solution diluted with 2 or 3 parts
of water. The image appears very rapidly.

9. Having washed the plate with water, it is now placed in a solu-
tion of hyposulphite of soda, which in one minute causes the image
to brighten up exceedingly by removing a kind of veil which pre-
viously covered it.

10. The plate is then washed with distilled water and the process
is terminated. In order, however, to guard against future accidents
it is well to give the picture another coating of albumen and varnish.

These operations may appear Jong in the description, but they are rapidly
enough executed after a Jittle practice. In the process which I have now
described I trust that I have effected a harmonious combination of several
previously ascertained and valuable facts, especially of the photographic prop-
erty of iodide of iron, which was discovered by Doctor Woods, of Parsontown,
in Ireland: and that of sulphate of iron, for which science is indebted to the
researches of Mr. Robert Hunt. In the true adjustment of the proportions and
in the mode of operation lies the difficulty of these investigations, since it is
possible by adopting other proportions and manipulations not very greatly dif-
fering from the above, and which a careless reader might consider to be the
same, not only to fail in obtaining the highly exalted sensibility which is desir-
able in this process, but actually to obtain scarcely any photographic result at all.

Mr. Talbot proposed the name of * amphitype,” or doubtful image
for these pictures. This name had, however, been adopted pre-
viously, at Mr. 'Talbot’s recommendation, by Sir John Herschel, and
in the collodion processes, to be by and by described, we have similar
phenomena, to which the name applies with equal force.

It is not improbable that the high degree of sensibility which is
certainly obtained in this process is rather due to the formation of an
iodide of ethyl in the mixture than to the combination, as Mr. Talbot
supposes, of the proto-iodide and the proto-sulphate of iron. My
own researches convince me that we should seek for the highest
degrees of sensibility amidst the numerous combinations of the
ethyl and methyl compounds with the metallic oxides.
THEORIES OF ORE DEPOSITION HISTORICALLY
CONSIDERED. - ;

By S. Fk. EMMOoNS.¢@

In the city in which we meet this year an exposition is preparing
which is designed to commemorate the peaceful acquirement a cen-
tury ago of the rights of France to the Mississippi Valley and the
regions to the west. It was the metallic wealth of the valley region
which first led to its exploration by the French, and which still con-
stitutes an important feature in its industry, yielding annually, as it
does, an amount about equal to the original purchase price. To a
still greater degree has the unexampled rapidity with which, in the
last half century, civilization and industry have spread over the
mountainous regions of the West been due to the development of
their mineral resources—a development to which geological science
has in no small measure contributed.

In selecting a subject for my address as president of the Geological
Society of America it has seemed appropriate, therefore, both to the
time and to the place, to choose a theme that has to do with that
branch of geology which js especially concerned with the deposits
of the metals. The history of theories of ore deposition was the sub-
ject originally chosen, but, as it gradually developed in the course
of research, it was found that anything worthy of that name would
far exceed the proper limits of an address. Thus its scope has been
gradually narrowed to fit the necessities of the occasion, until it
has become little more than a brief enumeration of the opinions held
from time to time within the historic period which seems to have
Jeft the most permanent impress upon the minds of geologists.

The term “ore deposition,” which is used in preference to its
earlier synonym “vein formation” as more correctly representing
the broader conceptions of the present day, applies, it is hardly

whose origin there has never been any wide divergence of opinion.

PREHISTORICAL VIEWS.

The historic period is assumed to have been entered on only with
the revival of learning about the time of the Reformation at the
commencement of the sixteenth century. What few records can be
found of genetic opinions held before that time, even as to the more
striking and readily observable geological phenomena, such as vol-
‘anic eruptions, earthquakes, and changes in the earth’s surface, are
too scattered and fragmentary to afford evidence of any continuous
development of thought. The views of the Pythagorean and Aris-
totelian schools of philosophy on the causes of these natural phe-
nomena, though apparently based more on bold poetical fantasy than
exact observation, present a clearer and more logical conception than
that which obtained nearly twenty centuries later. Thus it is said
that as early as°600 B. C. the observed occurrence in the rocks of
casts of shells and plants were ascribed to periodical floodings of
the land. During the Middle Ages, however, under the monkish
influence that discouraged any views that might throw doubt on the
literal correctness of the Mosaic cosmogony. these fossils were vari-
ously assumed to have been formed in place by the agencies of the
stars, to have been transformed from rock by some plastic force
(vis plastica), or left by the waters of the Noachian deluge.

Among the early cosmogonies, which it is true are of mythologic
rather than of scientific interest, the Chinese is the only one which
included metal among the elements of creation. Yet the general use
of the metals, whose extraction from their native ores presupposes
a knowledge of the art of smelting—in itself an evidence of a certain
insight into nature’s processes—goes back to very remote antiquity.
It seems possible that the philosophers of these earher civilizations
may have indulged in speculations as to the origin of the metals,
but if so they left no written record. Even among the Romans, of
whose proficiency in mining evidence is found in most of the mining
regions that came under their control, little or no genetic speculation
was indulged in, if we accept the evidence of Pliny’s Natural His-
tory. This monumental work, which is assumed to contain a com-
plete and faithful presentation of the knowledge of natural phe-
nomena at the opening of the Christian era, though it described in
considerable detail the methods of mining then in vogue, does not
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. oa

even attempt a description of the mode of occurrence of the ores,
much less speculate on their origin.

The historic time here contemplated may be divided, in a general
way, into three periods, according to the prevailing method by which
the views then current were arrived at.

DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.
THE THREE PERIODS.

1. The speculative period, in which, from a few rather imperfectly
determined facts of nature, general theories were evolved intended to
be applicable to all natural phenomena. It was a period in which
geology was not yet recognized as a distinct science and had hardly
reached the dignity of an adjunct to mineralogy.

2. The second period was that in which facts of observation had
accumulated sufficiently to establish geology on the basis of a distinct
science, but in which the method of reasoning from generals to par-
ticulars still prevailed. This was the first scientific period.

3. The third period might be called the period of verification, in
which the theories already propounded were tested by experiment
or observation.

Such a classification is in the nature of things not susceptible of a
very definite demarcation either in pomt of time or in the assignment
to either period of individual opinions or theories, but the attempt to
make it, however imperfect and unsuccessful it may prove, will assist
us to form a clearer conception of the progress of human thought and
of the methods by which it has arrived at its present understanding of
the particular branch of geological science which we are considering.

THE SPECULATIVE PERIOD.

During the first or speculative period, which may be assumed to
have extended up to the close of the eighteenth century, or to the time
of Werner and Hutton, the accumulation of accurately determined
facts that would bear on the theory of ore deposits was so extremely
limited that it may be assumed to have exercised but little influence
en the development of. the science beyond the suggestion it afforded
to later students of lines of investigation to be followed, and hence
may be passed over in a very cursory manner.

In the speculations of this period which especially influenced the
development of opinion two general types may be distinguished :

First. The broader theories of the cosmic philosophers with regard
to the formation of the earth, based more or less upon astronomic
data.

Second. The special theories of mineral vein formation conceived
by individuals and based in the main on general conceptions which

‘
312 THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.

were supplemented by a certain amount of personal observation and
experience,

The cosmic philosophers were men who, without being geologists in
the modern sense of the word, never theless put forth ideas with re-
gard to the system of the earth that had an undoubted influence on the
minds of those who have since made a special study of this part of
science.

First of these was Descartes, the French mathematician and
founder of the Cartesian system of philosophy (Principia, 1644), who
considered the earth a planet like the sun, but which, though cooled
and consolidated at its surface, still preserved in its interior a central
fire that caused the return toward the surface of waters of infiltra-
tion, the filling of veins by the metals, and the dislocations of the solid
crust.

Nearly contemporary with him was Steno, a Danish physician, who
spent the greater part of his life in Italy, where he devoted much of
his time to the study of geological phenomena. He was the first to
seek to learn the origin of rocks and the changes in the earth’s crust
by the inductive method. He wrote a remarkable treatise, bearing
the quaint title “ De Solido intra Solidum naturaliter Contento ”
(1669), in which he considers vein fissures to be later than the inclos-
ing rocks and their filling to result from the condensation of vapors
proceeding from the interior. Steno’s ideas, so much in advance of
those of his age, seem to have found little favor among his contempo-

varies, and were scarcely known among geologists until called to their
attention in the first half of the nineteenth century by de Beaumont
and von Humboldt.

Later Leibnitz, a German philosopher, opie both by the ideas
of Descartes and the observations and deductions of Steno, wrote a
work on the origin of the earth (Protogwa, 1691), which, in spite of
its necessarily limited basis of facts, bears the imprint of genius in its
conceptions. In applying his theories to the veins of the Hartz,
which he had occasion to visit during his thirty years’ sojourn at
Hanover, Leibnitz considers that they have been filled sometimes by
the liquefying action of fire, sometimes by water.

In the following century Buffon, the great French philosopher,
excited to the highest degree the attention of the scientific world by
his Théorie de la Terre, 1749, and Epoques de la Nature, 1778. His
conceptions, though striking by the brilliancy of their imagination,
have for the most part not proved of enduring value. Nevertheless
they served a purpose by stimulating more exact observations on the
points with regard to which his views were contested. With regard
to mineral veins he held that they were primarily fissures opened
in the mountains through the force of contraction, and that they
were filled by metals which by long and constant heat had separated
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 313

from other vitrifiable materials. But as there are nonvitrifiable as
well as vitrifiable materials in veins, so there are secondary veins
which have been filled with nonvitrifiable minerals by the action of
water. The primary veins he considers to be characteristic of high
mountains, while the secondary veins occur rather at the foot of the
mountains, and probably derived some of their material from the
primary veins.

In the second class the foremost place, both im time and in the
Importance of his actual observations, must be accorded to Dr.
George Bauer, better known by his Latinized name of Agricola, a
German physician who flourished during the first half of the six-
teenth century. He spent a great part of his life among the mines
of Saxony (Joachimsthal), of which he made a careful study. He
wrote in most excellent Latin several works on mineralogy and on the
art of mining, which were for centuries standard books of reference
on these subjects, and even to the present day contain much of inter-
est to the mining engineer. Agricola was first and foremost a miner-
alogist, and all his work was characterized by acuteness of observa-
tion and accuracy of description, though in strong contrast to most
of the early writers he did not indulge much in earth-formation theo-
ries. He divided mineral veins into “ commissure ” (joints or rents),
“ fibre” (small branching veins), “ vene ” (large veins or channels),
and “ terre canales” (vein systems), and gives a clear account of
their size, position, intersections, etc. In theoretical matters he was
less definite and satisfactory.

During all this period the two main subjects of speculation with
regard to mineral veins, which term practically included all ore
deposits, were (1) their age relative to the rocks in which they were
found, and (2) the cause and manner of their filling; and in consider-
ing the views put forward on these subjects we must bear in mind
that chemistry as a science only came into existence toward the end
of the eighteenth century, hence the ideas which were entertained as
to the processes that may have gone on within the earth’s crust to
form metallic deposits were necessarily somewhat vague and fanciful.

Among the ideas current in his time Agricola, as a result of his
observations, promptly rejected the views that veins were formed
contemporaneously with the primary rocks of the globe and that the
planets had an influence in the formation of the metals, but he
seems to have had very few positive ideas of his own as to their ori-
gin, though inclining to ascribe vein filling to material brought in
by circulating waters. He still entertained the idea of a lapidifying
juice, which he conceived as giving to water the power of absorb-
ing earth and of corroding*metals, and which might have formed
fossil casts as well as minerals. His use of the term “ fossilia ” for
both minerals and petrifications, which was retained by subsequent

.

geological writers, especially those of the Wernerian school, is often
a cause of misconception among modern readers who have occasion
to consult the older works on geology and mineralogy.

For over a century after Agricola there appears to have been little
written that had any special bearing on ore deposits, but toward the
close of the seventeenth century there was an apparent awakening of
interest in regard to their origin among reflective men who had to do
directly or indirectly with mines, which may probably have been
prompted by the theories of the cosmic philosophers, so that by the
close of the eighteenth century there had accumulated considerable
speculative literature on this subject.

The following is a list of the more frequently quoted works that
appeared during this period, with the approximate dates of their
publication:

survey of Hanover (1787).

The views of most of these early writers were rather curious than
instructive, yet some of them, especially those of men who had the
largest practical experience in mines, are remarkably suggestive.

Rosler, the earliest recorded mine superintendent, recognized that
veins differ from ordinary cracks in the rocks only by being: filled
with metallic minerals, but did not speculate on their genesis.
Becher and his commentator, Stahl, both professors of medicine,
assumed in a general way that mineral veins were original cracks 1
the rocks containing matter that had been changed into vein minerals
by some exhalations from the interior. Henkel supposed further that
certain kinds of rock or stone which served as matrices were favorable
and even absolutely necessary to the formation of vein minerals.
Zimmermann, who, like Henkel, was a chemist rather than a miner,
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 3815

considered that the material of veins, originally the same as the
inclosing rock, had been altered by some saline solution and thus pre-
pared for its final transformation into metallic minerals. The above,
which might be called conversion theories, do not necessarily assume
that veins are mechanically formed cracks, and hence of more recent
formation than the inclosing rocks.

Von Trebra, a director of mines who was seeking for facts to aid in
their exploitation, thought the changes observed in mountains took
place slowly under the influence of heat and humidity, and expressed
his idea of conversion as applied to veins more distinctly as the taking
away of one constituent of a rock and replacing it by another. The
agent of the transformation he called putrefaction or fermentation,
by which names he wished to designate some unknown force which
produced the chemical changes observed in the rocks.

Lehmann, a mineralogist and also a director of mines, supposed that
the veins found in mines are only the branches and twigs of an
immense trunk that extends to a great depth in the bowels of the
earth, where nautre is carrying on the manufacture of the metals, and
whence they travel toward the surface through rents in the rocks i
the form of vapors and exhalations, as the sap rises and circulates
through plants and trees. This general view is popular among
practical miners even at the present day, probably because it appeals
almost exclusively to the imagination.

Delius, Gerhard, and Lasius had the general idea that veins were
fissures formed later than the inclosing rocks, which had been filled
by materials brought in by circulating waters. The last went so far
as to suppose that these waters contained carbonic acid and other
solvents which enabled them to gather up metallic materials in their
passage through the rocks. In this respect he approached closely to
modern views, but he was in doubt whether the metals were contained
in the rocks as such, or whether the solvents possessed the power of
turning the substances they encountered in one place into lead and in
another into silver or some other metal.

Of more permanent value were the works of Von Oppel (1749) and
de Charpentier (1778), who were successively directors of the Saxon
mines previous to Werner.

Von Oppel was the first to distinguish bedded deposits (lager-
giinge), or those which le parallel with the stratification, from true
veins. He also gave to the small branches from a main vein the name
of “ stringers” (triimmer), and noted that veins sometimes shift or
fault the strata they cross, in which ease he calls them “ shifters ”
(wechsel). He laid stress on the importance of the causes which have
produced rents or fissures in the earth, and shows how in the forma-
tion of mountains the rocks, being exposed to great desiccation and
violent shocks, might split one from another, thus producing sents

.

with some open spaces, which being afterwards filled, would form
mineral veins. ‘* Where a vein has been cut or deranged by a visible
rent,” he remarks, “it is again to be met with by following the
direction of this last.”

Charpentier was a careful observer and a very cautious theorizer.
He says, ‘“ Natural history will always gain more from true and
accurate descriptions of her phenomena than from many and yet too-
early explanations offered for them ”—a most excellent principle
which he admirably carries out in his own work. He presents many
arguments derived from his own extensive observations in mines
against the prevalent theory that veins were once open cracks formed
by contraction, and that they had been filled by material flowing in
from the surrounding rocks and hardening in them. Some of his
objections were:

That contraction could not have made the kind of fissures that the
veins are found to fill.

Open or empty spaces could not have existed under the conditions
present when they were formed; pressure would have closed them.

The fragments of country rock as found in veins could not thus be
accounted for. If they had simply fallen into an open crack, they
would have accumulated at its bottom.

The comparatively uniform arrangement of ore in the vein, the
enrichment caused by the crossing of one vein by another, the tran-
sition from vein material to country rock, etc., could not be explained
on the contraction theory.

Having given his reasons why he beheves that veins are not the
filling of wide open spaces in the rocks, he says his readers will natu-
‘ally ask how he supposes them to have been formed, and although he
is not anxious to present a theory, he says he can not see from his
observation of the workings of nature any other method for the for-
mation of veins or other ore deposits than by an actual transforma-
tion of the rock material. Nature’s processes have created innumer-
able small cracks and fissures in the rocks, and when a great num-
ber of such cracks le together and in a common direction they might
give rise to a considerable vein deposit. Vapors bringing in mineral
solutions might penetrate these small cracks, as the sap rises in capil-
lary tubes in organic bodies. If thereby the intermediate rock mass
became changed into vein material, a vein deposit might be created
without the necessity of wide empty spaces for its reception.

Rather more than usual space has been given here to Charpentier’s
work because of the striking contrast of his mental attitude with that
of his great successor, Werner, whose reputation so completely over-
shadowed him that he has received less notice from later writers than
seems to be his due.
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. ole
THE SCIENTIFIC PERIOD.

The first scientific period may be said to have been entered on near
the close of the eighteenth century, when De Saussure (1779), Pallas
(1777), and Werner (1791) almost simultaneously inaugurated by
their works the era of positive geology. It was about the same time
that chemistry was placed on a scientific basis by the researches of
Lavoisier, Scheele, Priestley, Cavendish, and others. Up to this time
even the name geology had hardly been recognized, natural history or
mineralogy being the titles usually given to works that treated of it,
and the few exact facts with regard to it which such men as Agricola,
Steno, and others had determined were drowned in a sea of. conjec-
tures. On the Continent it was the mining schools that principally
fostered mineralogic and geonostic studies, and these had been but
recently founded, that at Freiberg, Saxony, in 1765; at Schemnitz,
Hungary, in i770; at St. Petersburg, in 1783; and at Paris, in 1790.
Geological literature, especially in Germany, went hand in hand with
that on mining and mineralogy.

Of the three men just named, the two first were eminently observers.
Pallas, after being called to the mining school at St. Petersburg, had
made a six years’ geological expedition through the mountains of
Russia and Siberia, and De Saussure for over thirty years was largely
busied in studying geological phenomena in his native Alps, being
the first to climb Mont Blane and Monte Rosa. He also appears to
have been the first working geologist to use the name geology for his
science. While neither of these men contributed much to the advance-
ment of geological theory, they added largely to the store of ascer-
tained fact, which is its necessary basis, and their greatest service, per-
haps, was in inaugurating geological studies of the great mountain
systems of the world, which more than any other branch of geological
inquiry have been instrumental in raising this science to its present
stand.

The actual field of observation of Werner, on the other hand, was
extremely restricted, scarcely extending beyond the confines of his
native Saxony. He had, however, a genius for the analysis, classi-
fication, and coordination of observations, which enabled him to bring
order out of the chaos of fact and fancy which then constituted the
science. With an eminently didactic mind, he possessed, with much
personal charm, such a power of impressing his ideas upon his pupils,
that during the forty years that he occupied the chair of mining and
mineralogy the Freiberg school was the center of geological studies
in Europe. From it emerged so many distinguished geologists, as
the fruit of his teachings, that, as Cuvier says, “ from one end of the
world to the other nature was interrogated in the name of Werner.”

_ Contemporaneously with Werner an equally great service was being
818 THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.

rendered to geology at Edinburgh, in Scotland, by James Hutton,
who, like so many of the eminent geologists of the world, had been
educated as a physician. Hutton, like Werner, taught mainly through
his lectures, neither of them finding time for much writing, so that
the doctrines of either have become known to posterity mainly
through the publications of their pupils.

Each of these great teachers aimed to discard theory and to build
their respective systems on a basis of ascertained facts, but in the then
existing condition of geological investigation certain fundamental
conceptions had to be assumed from the interpretation given to as yet
imperfectly studied phenomena. With minds lke theirs, strong in
the courage of their convictions, an interpretation once fairly rea-
soned out and accepted became an established fact, and thus it came
about that through a difference in their premises their respective sys-
tems were diametrically opposed and gave rise to the great controversy
between Neptunists and Plutonists, which for nearly fifty years di-
vided the scientific world of Europe into two antagonistic schools.
Werner assumed that the earth had once been surrounded by an ocean
of water at least as deep as the mountains are high, and that from this
ocean there were deposited by chemical precipitation the solid rocks
which now form the dry land. He entirely ignored the internal heat
of the globe in its influence on crystalline rocks, on ore deposits, and
as a cause of the dislocations of stratified rocks. Hutton, on the
other hand, while not 1gnoring the agency of water in the formation
of the sedimentary rocks, ascribed to subterranean heat and the ex-
panding power it exercised their final consolidation, their disturbed
condition, and the changes produced in the older rocks, to which Lyell
later gave the name of metamorphism.

Neither made any distinction between dikes and mineral veins, but
while Hutton supposed fissures and openings to have been formed
from time to time which reached through the external crust down to
the hot nucleus, and that both were formed by molten matter forced
up through them toward the surface, Werner, on the other hand,
taught that they were contraction fissures which were filled by ma-
terial held in suspension or in solution; that a primeval ocean once
covered them, and hence they must have been filled from above.

In general matters Hutton’s reasoning and observations were both
broader and more logical than Werner’s, and his views have hence
proved more enduring, but he had little, if any, personal knowledge
of ore deposits. Werner made their study an important feature
of the geologist’s training, and his principal publication was entitled
“A New Theory of Vein Formation.” Although this work was the
only important one exclusively devoted to the subject, owing to the
fatal defects in his geological premises, it contributed little to the per-
manent advancement of that branch of the science, and it may even
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 39

be questioned whether it did not retard it, since through the great
weight of the author’s name it remained a standard work in Germany
long after many of his peculiar geological theories had been dis-
carded. Its merit lay less in the novelty of the views advanced, most
of which had already been put forth by one or another of his prede-
cessors, than in the logical way in which they were presented.

The principal points with regard to the origin of ore deposits
which may be considered as fairly well established by Werner’s
teachings are that they are the filling of fissures and cracks of later
formation than the inclosing rocks, and consist of foreign material
subsequently introduced, largely in aqueous solution. As to the
fissures themselves, while a certain systematic arrangement had been
noted in their directions, and the fact that, where by intersection,
one had been shifted or faulted by another, inferences as to their
relative age might be drawn, little definite conception was appar-
ently had as to their origin beyond the general suggestion that they
might be the result of subsidence or of contraction of the rock masses
in which they occur.

Any important advance over these rather crude conceptions was
hardly to be looked for until very decided progress had been made in
the broad general theories of geology, and this progress was neces-
sarily very slow. Although the period of reasoning from facts of
nature to generalizations had commenced, the tendency to pure
speculation was not yet extinct, and resulted in many remarkable
theories, such as that put forth by Professor Oken, of Jena, who,
in his text-book of Natural Philosophy (1809), assumed that the
earth was a polyeder formed according to the laws of crystallo-
graphy, and that veins or fissures resulted from the loss of the
water of crystallization. For the genesis of ores, darkness, earthy
water, and air are necessary; hence there can be no ore in the interior
of the earth, since no air reaches it, etc. Or, again, that of Breislak,
the Itahan geologist (1811), who put forth a plutonic earth theory
which supposed that while the rocks were still in a molten condition
the metals had a tendency to separate under the influence of specific
gravity and of certain chemical and physical affinities, and localized
themselves in veins without entirely separating from their country
rock. This is apparently the first enunciation of the modern theory
of magmatic segregation. The metallic grains in placers he supposed
to have been granulated like slag on coming in contact with water.

The peculiar views of Werner naturally held sway longer in Ger-
many than elsewhere, yet it was his favorite pupils that were first
led, in their widening fields of observation, to abandon his theory
that basalt is of aqueous origin, though altered by the heat produced
through the combustion of neighboring beds of coal.

Von Buch, for a long time the leading geologist of Germany, was

.
320 THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.

perhaps the first to whom doubts came as to the correctness of his
master’s teachings, while studying an eruption of Vesuvius in 1799,
though he refrained from immediate publication of these doubts.

D’Aubuisson, the French geologist, after visiting, in 1804, the vol-
canic regions of Auvergne, also became convinced of its igneous origin
and published a recantation of the views maintained in his essay of
the previous year on the aqueous origin of the basalts of Saxony.
Finally, von Humboldt (1810), perhaps the greatest of his pupils,
in his extended observations in the Cordilleran system of the Amer-
ican continents, traced a direct connection between metallic deposits
and the eruptive rocks.

Observation must have convinced many of Werner’s pupils of the
untenability of his peculiar views on the formation and filling of
veins long before their final refutation was published by his succes-
sor, von Beust, in 1840, but reverence for his memory doubtless pre-
vented a definite expression of their opinions in print.

Von Herder, in his work on the Meissner adit, published in 1838,
classified the various theories on the origin of veins that had been
held up to that time, as follows:

1. Theory of contemporaneous formation (with the inclosing rock).

2. Theory of (filling by) lateral secretion, or by material derived
from the inclosing rocks.

3. Theory of (filling by) descension, or filling from above.

4. Theory of (filling by) ascension, or filling from below, the lat-
ter subdivided into:

(a) By infiltration, or solutions from mineral (thermal) waters.

(b) By sublimation, or by ascending steam.

(c) By sublimation, or in gaseous condition.

(7) By injection or in igneous fluid state.

He was thus apparently the first to apply the now time-honored
terms “ ascension,” “ descension,” and “ lateral secretion,” though the
idea was clearly expressed thirty years before by Cuvier’s collab-
orator, Alexandre Brogniart, when, in an attempt to reconcile the
Huttonian and Wernerian schools. he showed that no one theory
could fit all kinds of veins.

The theories of contemporaneous formation and of descension had
by this time become practically obsolete among the Germans, and
had never had much standing among geologists of other nations.
German geologists, who have been the most assiduous students of
vein phenomena in the field, have always been inclined to assume
that vein minerals have been deposited by precipitation from aque-
ous solution, differences of opinion having been mainly as to the
provenance of the waters. Doubtless the influence of Werner had
much to de with their mental attitude, but it is also to be remarked
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 321

that this method of formation best fits the ore deposits of their
country. :

In England, the home. of Plutonism, on the other hand, no very
decided views on theories of ore deposition were held. John Maccul-
longh, in 1821-1825, after a discussion of the Wernerian-Huttonian
views, wisely concludes that it is necessary to study nature’s proe-
esses more closely before a satisfactory theory can be formulated.
He enumerates the minerals occurring in ore deposits which may be
formed by infiltration or solution and by sublimation, contending
that many vein minerals can be produced in either way, and recom-
mends further investigations along that line.

John Taylor, in his report on minelar veins to the British Associa-
tion in 1833, makes a similar review and arrives at similarly indefi-
nite conclusions.

Later, De la Beche, in his Geology of Cornwall (1839), says:

The theories of the day divide themselves into, first, the contemporaneous
formation of mineral veins with the rocks which inclose them; second, the
olling of fissures formed in rocks by the sublimation of substances driven by
heat from beneath upward; and, third, the filling of fissures in rocks by chem-
ical deposits from substances in solution in the fissures, such deposits being
greatly due to electro-chemical agency. .

The contemporaneous theory, according to him, was still gener-
ally held among Cornish miners. but he himself is evidently more
inclined to the theory of deposition by solutions ascending under the
influence of internal heat, the water being furnished from the sea,
which covered many of the Cornish lodes.

The electro-chemical theory, which had already been suggested in
1810 by Bergrath Schmidt, and for a time enjoyed a certain popular-
ity among English geologists, was founded mainly on observations
made on the mine waters of Cornwall by Robert Ware Fox. This
theory assumed that vein minerals had been precipitated from solu-
tion under the influence of electrical currents. It would appear,
however, that, owing to the imperfect knowledge of chemistry of
that time, the believers in this theory assumed electric currents to be
a necessity for the production of certain reactions when they only
serve to facilitate them. Fox’s observations on the action of mine
waters on minerals were, moreover, rendered somewhat inconclusive
by the fact that he did not distinguish between primary vein min-
erals and those that have been formed during their secondary altera-
tion by surface waters.

Among French geologists Plutonist views were predominant from
the first; even those who, under the influence of Werner’s magnetic
teaching, had for a time embraced his Neptunist theory soon re-
canted it when their field of observation had widened to include vol-

canic regions. ‘The cosmic theory, generally known as the “ nebular
hypothesis,” the one which has been most universally accepted by
geologists as an explanation of the earth’s beginnings, as finally re-
ceived, was the work of a French mathematician, Laplace (1796).
Hence, in seeking to account for the origin of ore deposits they were
naturally inclined to look for igneous agencies. Thus, A. Burat,
well known through his work’ “* Applied Geology,” 1843, took extreme
Plutonic views and divided the copper, lead, and iron deposits of the
Ttalian peninsula, which he had especially studied, into (1) dikes or
eruptive masses, with gangue of amphibolite and livaite; and (2)
irregular veins of contact between eruptive serpentine and_ sedi-
mentary rocks. The Elba deposits of specular iron, which he re-
garded as striking instances of the first class, he considered to have
exercised an elevatory as well as metamorphic action on the inclosing
rocks at the time of their injection. Fournet, another prominent
authority on the subject, maintained a theory of igneous injection for
vein fillings as late as 1859.
As in Germany, it was the professors in the mining schools, espe-
-clally those at Freiberg, who, in the early part of the century, led in
forming scientific opinion as to ore deposition, so it was the School
of Mines at Paris which later furnished the leaders in that branch of
geological thought.

The French students of underground phenomena were at a certain
disadvantage as compared with their German brethren, in that they
were obliged to travel to foreign countries to study large mines.
whereas the German schools were all situated in the midst of impor-
tant mining districts. On the other hand, while the German displays
great industry and acuteness of observation in his collection of facts,
the Frenchman has a remarkable faculty of logically grouping them
and of clearly and concisely stating the conclusions to be drawn
therefrom. The French language, moreover, by its structure is much
better adapted to a concise presentation of scientific concepts that may
be readily understood by the reader than the German, which is likely
to be involved and cumbersome in its mode of expression. Hence,
toward the middle of the century the influence of the French geolo-
gists on genetic speculation became predominant, especially as it
was based on synthetic experiment, a branch of geological investiga-
tion which for a time they practically monopolized.

The first of the French geologists who has left an enduring impress
upon the theory of ore deposits was Elie de Beaumont, who for nearly
fifty years occupied the chair of geology at the Paris School of Mines
(1827-1874). In 1847 he published, as an abstract of his lectures, his
well-known paper “ Volcanic and metalliferous emanations,” in which
he does not claim to formulate a complete or final theory, but presents
his views as explanations which seemed to him best to fit the facts of
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 828

nature as then known. His conclusions are, briefly: That the metal-
lic minerals in veins of incrustation (since called crustification ) find
their ultimate source in eruptive rocks, from which they emanate at
first in gaseous form. As they pass through long canals or fissures,
at greater distances from the center of eruption, they must condense
and thus form deposits analogous to those of springs at their point
of exit. The metals in veins are found united less frequently with
oxygen than with certain elements to which the name * mineralizers ”
has been given, and which are not only volatile themselves, but possess
the property of rendering volatile many substances with which they
combine. These are sulphur, selenium, arsenic, antimony, phos-
phorus, tellurium, chlorine, bromine, iodine, ete.

Mineral springs he divides into principal or hottest thermals, which
are fed by gases emanating directly from eruptive masses which reach
the surface in a fluid state, and, second, less heated springs, which
often accompany the former. The latter are fed by meteoric waters,
which descend until they come in contact with hot rocks and, when
heated, ascend again, in which journey they may be charged with
mineral substances.

Vein deposits may be formed by either class of thermals; the sec-
ond class would form deposits not only in ordinary fissures, but also
in those already charged by direct emanations. It is difficult to
account for the gangue minerals as direct emanations, since they are
not volatile except such as are combined with fluorine. Certain
deposits without gangue in eruptive rocks and deposits in limestone
in contact with eruptive rocks, associated with garnet, ilvaite, and
similar minerals, may have been deposited by sublimation, but these
are exceptional. For most veins he admits, in accord with Bischof,
that the earthy minerals must have come from the decomposition of
the country rocks. The greater proportion of true veins (veins of
incrustation) he considers to have been formed by deposition from
Waters circulating in cracks in the earth’s crust. In this, his theory
resembles Werner’s, but differs from it in assuming that the solutions
were ascending rather than descending. Werner’s argument in favor
of descending waters, namely, that veins become poorer in depth, he
considers not well founded, the facts of nature rather going to prove
that the solutions became weaker as they approached the surface.

Stanniferous veins, which contain a great number of the rarer ele-
ments and are associated with acid rocks, are the type of the first
class, while ordinary or plumbiferous veins, which are characterized
by the important réle of mineralizers and the absence of anhydrous
silicates, are usually associated with basic rocks.

His reasoning is evidently based largely on his observations in
Cornwall, and on an assumed difference in the origin of granite and
of volcanic rocks in general. Granite, he assumes, owes its crystal-

.
3824 THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.

linity less to the fact of having crystallized at great depths than to
its content of water (2 to 3 per cent), which enabled it to remain in a
pasty condition much below its fusion point, and thus allowed quartz
to take the impress of other minerals. The minerals of the first
group of veins form part of the outer crust (penumbra) of granite
bodies, as granite once formed the outer crust of the earth.

The products of volcanic eruptions he divides into two classes:
(1) the lava-hke, which consist of silicates in a molten condition;
(2) the sulphur-lke, which emanate in a molecular condition. To
the latter alone can the formation of vein minerals be attributed.
The term “ solfataric,” which was employed by subsequent writers
to describe the action of the sulphur-lke emanations, has since been
very generally used by writers on ore deposits in a sense which is not
always strictly accurate.

Although de Beaumont’s views are based on some premises no
longer considered tenable, they mark an important advance in this
line of research, in that they may be said to be the first fruits of
organized field investigation, for the first geological surveys, those
of Great Britain and of France, had been founded about ten years
before, and the first geological map of France had recently (1841)
been completed by the latter survey, of which he was the founder and
director.

This was also an era of experimental investigation, as well as of
observation in the field. Following the example of Sir James Hall,
who had, as early as 1805, spent some years in experimenting on
the transformation of rocks under the combined influence of heat
and pressure, French geologists were actively employed in attempt-
ing, by synthetical experiment in the laboratory, to imitate the proc-
esses of nature in the formation of rocks and minerals, especially
of vein minerals. Prominent among those engaged in this work
were Berthier, Becquerel, Ebelmen, Durocher, Sénarmont, and
Daubrée. At first with heat alone and later employing heat and
water combined, always under pressure, they succeeded in repro-
ducing artificially a great number of the minerals of rocks and veins.
Sénarmont (1849-1851), by the aid of water at temperatures of 130°
to 300° ©., formed artificially 30 of the principal minerals found in
ore deposits, including quartz. The results of these experiments
did not, however, prove decisively the agents which nature has em-
ployed, since they demonstrated that the samme mineral may be formed
by several different methods. This was appreciated by Daubrée,
who, commencing his synthetical experiments with the artificial
production of cassiterite in 1844, carried on experimental investi-
gations into the mechanics of rock fracturing, the flow of subter-
ranean waters, and rock metamorphism in general to near the close
of the century. He was particularly impressed by his studies of
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 825

the mineral processes that have gone on since Roman times in the
masonry of old thermal establishments at Plombieres, Bourbonne-
les-Bains, and elsewhere, in which he thought to trace the actual
processes of vein formation. His works, Experimental Geology,
1879, and Subterranean Waters, 1887, which contain the first philo-
sophic discussion based on experiment of the physics of the rock
fractures that constitute canals for the circulation of underground
waters, are still classic works of reference for the students of ore
deposits. Daubrée understood veins to be fractures formed by
dislocations of the earth’s crust under pressure strains and _ filled
by deposits from aqueous solutions, generalky heated by contact with
igneous rocks, from which in certain cases they may have directly
emanated. From his observations at Plombiéeres he inferred that
most minerals are soluble if given sufficient water and time, and that
great heat and pressure are not absolutely necessary prerequisites.
Some of the materials of veins, he admitted, may have been derived
from the surrounding rocks.

The middle of the nineteenth century was characterized by the
increasing use of laboratory experiments in chemistry and physics
as aids in testing the current theories of vein formation, as is shown
in the preceding sketch of progress of opinions among French
geologists.

Similar progress was gomg on in other countries, especially in
Germany, which was more particularly a country of mines and
mining engineers, though among students of this subject there was
less solidarity of opinion than with the French, and their investiga-
tions for a long time were rather on chemical than on physical lines.

A great impulse to increased accuracy in geological investigation
was given by the classic work of G. Bischof, Physical and Chemical
Geology, 1846-47, which discusses in a masterly way the processes
involved in most of the known geological phenomena, largely on
the basis of the author’s own researches and experiments, and which
may be said to have raised chemical geology to the rank of a dis-
tinct science. In the course of his investigations, Bischof, having
found that the constituents of the gangue minerals of veins are
found in the country rocks, thought it probable that the metals of
the sulphide ores might also exist in these rocks in the form of sili-
cates. Later, and independently, Forchhammer, the Danish chemist,
in the course of his long continued investigations of the waters of
the ocean, detected minute amounts of many of the metals of ore
deposits both in sea water and in different varieties of rocks. It
was long before the suggestions offered by these discoveries had
any practical effect on ore-deposit investigations.

The leading authorities (on ore deposits) of that period were Von
Beust, Breithaupt, H. Miiller, and Von Cotta. The latter for over
326 THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.

thirty years occupied the chair of geology at Freiberg, during
which time he had opportunities of visiting most of the important
mines of Europe. His text-book on ore deposits (1853-1859), which
up to the end of the third quarter of the century was the standard
authority both in Europe and America (through Prime’s transla-
tion, 1869), may be assumed to be a good exponent of the knowledge
of the time. It gives a fair-minded statement of all the theories
which had been given to account for the formation of vein min-
erals, showing, however, a leaning toward the infiltration or hy-
drothermal theory of vein filling, based on the fact that some of the
most common constituents are found in existing thermal waters, and
that thermal waters containing CO, or H.S are found in the deeper
workings of some mines. In general, however, his views, whether
on classes of deposits or individual types, do not betray the firm
conviction that would result from an exhaustive and systematic
study. Moreover, the fact that his classification of deposits is based
on the more or less accidental character of form, without any ref-
erence to genesis, would indicate that his genetic ideas were still in
a tentative state.

In 1873 Prof. F. Sandberger, feeling that the current theories
inadequately explained many of the phenomena of vein deposits,
followed out the suggestions of Bischof by making an extended
series of analyses of the country rocks of veins. Separating previ-
ous to analysis the constituent minerals of the rocks by means of
solutions of varying densities, he succeeded in demonstrating to his
own satisfaction that the characteristic minerals of different depos-
its are contained in the basic silicates of the adjoming rocks, and in
1880 propounded his theory of lateral secretion, according to which
the mineral contents of veins are derived, not from some unknown
depth, but from the immediate wall rock, being brought in by
percolating waters which are not necessarily at a very high tem-
perature. As against the thermal-spring theory, he argued that a
very small proportion of known thermals contain any of the metal-
lic minerals whatever, and none in the state of sulphides; further,
that the deposits observed in their channels have been precipitated
in immediate proximity to the surface and under physical and chem-
ical conditions that differ essentially from those that must have pre-
vailed at the depths at which veins were formed.

Sandberger’s theory, though for a time it found many adherents,
was bitterly contested, especially by Stelzner, Von Cotta’s successor
at Freiberg, and by Posepny, professor at the Mining School of Pri-
bram, in Bohemia. They maintained that the facts in their respective
districts disproved the lateral secretion theory in the restricted sense
in which Sandberger employed it, and they demonstrated by a repe-
tition of his analyses that, owing to imperfect methods, he had not
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 827

proved the metals he found to be necessarily original constituents of
the rocks in which they were supposed to occur. Whatever opinion
may. be held as to the merits of Sandberger’s theory, as such, it un-
doubtedly contributed to the advance of the study of ore deposits in
stimulating what may be called “ verification ;” that is, the practical
testing of theory in its application to concrete instances in nature.

In general it may be said of the period that was now closing that,
though facts of observation and experiment had been accumulating,
the advances in the study of ore deposits during that time were much
less than those that had been made in other branches of geological
science.

THE VERIFICATION PERIOD.

The third period, covering in a general way the last quarter of the
past century, may be called the period of verification. So fertile
had been the imagination of previous thinkers on this subject that at
this time it was practically impossible to conceive a theory of origin
for a given ore deposit that had not already been proposed or at least
suggested. The investigations now to be carried on with more perfect
methods, or in the light of recent advances in the science, would seem
more properly verifications of old theories than the propounding of
new ones.

Method and the microscope have been the two great agents of
progress. The greatest Improvement in method has resulted from
government aid, under which it has been possible for organized bodies
of scientific workers to make special examinations of entire mining
districts, and thus determine all the facts bearing upon ore deposi-
tion in those districts with an exhaustiveness that was impracticable
for the unaided individual observer. The newly created science of
microscopical petrography, through the intimate knowledge it has
afforded of the internal structure of rocks and ores, has admitted so
accurate a determination of the processes by which they have been
formed that much that was formerly mere conjecture has become
established on basis of fact. America, which hitherto had occupied
a very subordinate position, had come to the front, not only in the
production of metallic ores, but im its correct understanding cf the
processes by which they were formed.

In order to properly appreciate the progress which has been made
during this period, one must endeavor to realize the mental stand-
point of the average student at the close of the preceding period.

To the miner and prospector, whose opmions carry weight because
of their wide practical experience, a typical ore deposit was a vein
which, once an open crack extending to an indefinite depth, had been
filled by material introduced in one way or another from below, and
the more nearly a deposit approached this typical form the greater

Y
328 THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.

its value. Indeed, for a time some of the most valuable deposits in
the West were entirely neglected by the prospector because they did
not possess the physical characteristics of the “true fissure vein.”
This misconception arose trom the fact that this, being the most
clearly defined form of deposit, had been the only one mentioned in
early speculations, and that hitherto the classification of text-books,
based as they were on the almost accidental characteristic of form,
relegated other types of deposit to a distinct and relatively subordi-
nate class, disregarding the fact that this class includes many of the
largest and most productive ore bodies, which may not only have the
same origin, but often be associated in the same deposit with a typical
fissure vein.

Von Groddeck (on the other hand), who represents the most ad-
vanced scientific opinions of his time (1879), divides ore deposits into
two classes :

1. Those formed contemporaneously with the inclosing rock,
whether (a) sedimentary or (0) eruptive.

2. Those of later formation classed under two heads:

(a) Those filling preexisting open spaces.
(b) Metamorphic deposits formed by alteration of rock in
place.

His two main divisions corresponded to a certain extent with those
made in 1854 by J. D. Whitney (Metallic Wealth of the United
States), namely, stratified and unstratified. One difference is that
metamorphic deposits were included by Whitney in the first division
and by Von Groddeck in his second. Neither recognized their true
importance, and the latter, while admitting that he included in this
class those that Stelzner had called metasomatic deposits, said they
could not be regarded as separate deposits, because they are only inci-
dental phenomena of the filling of cavities.

Asa means of obtaining a clear view of the whole field, Von Grod-
deck divided known deposits into types (54 in number), character-
ized in the main by their varying mineralogical and lithological asso-
ciations. Of these, 16 belong to his first subdivision, 5 to the second,
26 to the third, and 7 in part to the third and fourth, a classification
which he admitted must be considered but tentative, owing to defects
in existing knowledge which could be remedied only when all mines
could be studied on a monographic or exhaustive system.

In America, though apparently unknown to Von Groddeck, such
monographie studies had already been made—that of the Comstock
lode by King (Fortieth Parallel reports, 1870), of the Lake Superior
copper deposits by Pumpelly (Michigan geological survey, 1873),
and that of the lead deposits of the Mississippi Valley by Chamberlin
(Wisconsin geological survey, 1873-1879). These were followed in
the early eighties by reports on the Comstock lode by Becker, on Lead-

THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 329

ville by Emmons, on Eureka by Curtis, and on the copper-bearing
rocks of Lake Superior by Irving—monographie studies which consti-
tuted an important feature in the plan of work laid out for the newly
established United States Geological Survey. It was the expectation
of those who planned this work that when all the important mining
districts of the United States had been thus exhaustively studied, a
sufficient store of well-ascertained facts regarding ore deposits would
have been accumulated to admit of the formulation of a new theory
more firmly grounded on a basis of well-established fact than any that
had yet been presented.

It may be said of the deposits studied in the first decade of the Sur-
vey work that, in the form in which they were found, they were all
determined to have been deposited from aqueous solutions and to be
of later origin than the inclosing rocks. The lead and zine ores of
the Mississippi Valley might have been included in Von Groddeck’s
contemporaneous class if, as assumed by Whitney and Chamberlin,
these metals had been deposited with the limestones at the time of
their formation; but while, as to this ultimate source there is some
difference of opinion, all are agreed that the concentrations which
produced the workable ore bodies were of later date; hence it seems
more logical to consider them of later formation than the inclosing
rocks.

In the case of the other deposits studied, which were found to occur
either in or in the immediate vicinity of eruptive rocks, it was as-
sumed that the percolating waters had derived their metallic contents
from some of these eruptive rocks, which careful tests had shown to
contain small amounts of the various materials of the deposits. This
derivation had an advantage over that of indefinite depth appealed to
by the ascensionist or hydrothermal school, inasmuch as it admitted
some sort of experimental proof, indirect though it was, and because
at the depth at which the rocks might be supposed to be essentially
richer in metals than those found at the surface, cracks sufficiently
open to admit a free flow of thermal waters were considered impos-
sible under the conditions of pressure assumed to exist there. This
view was called a lateral-secretion theory, though it differed essen-
tially from that of Sandberger, in that the derivation of the vein
minerals was not restricted to the immediate wall rocks (Nebenges-
teine) of the deposits. Indeed, in a later discussion it was character-
ized as another form of the ascension theory. The circulating waters
which had brought in the vein materials were assumed, though not
always explicitly, to be of meteoric origin—waters which originally
descending from the surface had become heated either in contact with
igenous rocks or by the internal heat of the earth, and gathering up
mineral matter in their journey had redeposited it when conditions
favored precipitation rather than solution. The natural channels

.
330 THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.

through which these waters would circulate most freely, and which
hence were most favorable to ore deposition, were rock fractures pro-
duced by dynamic movements in the crust; faults or joints to which
Daubrée had given the designation “ lithoclases.” In no case were
these fractures found to be contraction fissures, which Werner and
many subsequent writers assumed to be the typical vein fissure, disre-
garding the consideration that contraction fissures could not traverse
two distinet bodies of rock. To the joint-like fissures that are con-
fined to a single bed, Whitney had already given the name “ gash ”
veins.

In the Comstock Lode report, Becker had discussed mathematically
the mechanics of faulting as applied to vein fissures, and had shown
that an important characteristic of faulting on a fissure in solid rock
is the tendency of the movement to separate the rock into sheets by
subordinate fissures parallel to the main one. From practical obser-
vation Emmons had similarly concluded that the faulting movement
which produced vein fissures was often distributed on a number of
parallel fissures, thus producing a sheeting of the country rock.
Where these fissures were sufliciently close together, so that the inter-
mediate sheets of country rock were very thin and had been partially
replaced by vein material, a banding would result which might be
mistaken for that of the typical vein of incrustation. Where they
were farther apart and of approximately equal strength, the mineral
filling, instead of being confined to a single fissure, might be distrib-
uted on several, thus rendering frequent crosscutting advisable in
their exploitation.

The idea that later-formed ore deposits are necessarily the filling of
considerable cavities or open spaces in the inclosing rocks has been
considerably modified by the important role that the process of meta-
somatic replacement or substitution has been shown to have played
in the formation of ore bodies. The idea of replacement had been
suggested in the conversion theories of the early speculators and more
distinetly expressed by Charpentier. By the geologists of the second
period it was comparatively neglected, though in a few cases admit-
ted as a subordinate factor, especially in the formation of deposits
in limestone. Even in Posepny’s frequently quoted studies of the
lead and zine deposits of Raibl in Carinthia (1873), he admits this
mode of formation only for the oxidized ores, considering the sul-
phide ores to have been deposited in open cavities.

In America Pumpelly first applied this process to the copper
deposits of the Lake Superior region (1871), of which he says: * In at
ieast very many instances, if not in all, the deposition of the copper is
the result of a process of displacement of preexisting minerals.”

Leadville and Eureka were the first large mining districts in which
it was proved that extensive ore deposits were entirely formed by
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 3831

metasomatic replacement of the inclosing rock, which in these cases
was limestone. Later observations showed that this form of deposit
was not confined to limestones, and that in fissure vein deposits, even
in acid rocks, metasomatic processes had often played an important
part in replacing by ore portions of the country rock which, under the
ald views, might have been regarded as vein filling. The interest and
importance of this view were speedily recognized, especially by
American geologists and mining engineers, and while still novel, it
was doubtless sometimes apphed without sufficient proof as an expla-
nation of the formation of certain vein deposits to the exclusion of that
of the filling of cavities or interstitial spaces. With the general
introduction of the microscope into the study of vein materials, how-
ever, a comparatively sure method was provided of distinguishing
the results of the two processes. The process of verification has in
this case resulted in the establishment of the importance and increas-
ingly wide appleability of the metasomatic theory to the formation
of ore deposits of all types.

In the latter part of the decade Irving and Van Hise’s studies of the
iron deposits of the Lake Superior region had demonstrated that they
had been deposited from solution in descending or meteoric waters,
whose downward course had been arrested by some impervious base-
ment—sometimes a dike, sometimes a bed in a synchinal basin—and
that during this time of stagnation their load of iron oxide had been
laid down as a metasomatic replacement of the inclosing rock, a de-

scens:onist theory, but of essentially modern type.

In 1893 appeared the well-known paper, * The Genesis of Ore
Deposits,” by Posepny, for ten years professor of this branch of the
science at the School of Mines in Pribram, Bohemia. Although
Posepny’s views were by no means universally accepted by geologists,
especially in America, all agreed that his work constituted a most
valuable contribution to the science by its clear definitions of the
questions involved and their masterly scientific discussion. The
great majority of ore deposits Posepny considered to be of later
origin than the inclosing rocks, even those that are found in stratified
rocks in apparent conformity with the bedding. Further, that they
have been deposited by precipitation from waters of the deep circu-
lation below the ground-water level. The ground water he conceived
descends by capillarity through rock interstices over large areas, to
rise again at a few points through open channels under the influence
of heat. It derives its mineral matter from the barysphere, or deep
region, where the rocks are richer in metallic minerals than near the
surface, and subsequently deposits them in open spaces as it ascends.
These spaces are either spaces of discission (rock fractures) or spaces
of solution, the latter sometimes being formed by ascending thermal
waters, even where no previous crack exists.

.
332. THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED.

Fresh as he was from his controversy with Sandberger over the
lateral-secretion theory, which he had disproved, at least in its apph-
cation to the Pfibram deposits, he was inclined to view with disfavor
anything that flavored of lateral secretion; hence, while admitting
that the presence of minute quantities of the metals in eruptive rocks
leads to the surmise that they had brought the whole series of heavy
metals up from the barysphere into the lithosphere or upper crust,
he preferred to assume, in the cases which the American geologists
had explained as derivation from eruptive rocks in the vicinity of the
deposits, that the mineral contents had been brought up by thermal
waters directly from the barysphere. Likewise, in the limestone
deposits, which their studies show to have been formed by metaso-
matic replacement, he thought that they must have overlooked some
evidence of crustification, and still held to the opinion that such
extensive deposits must be mainly the filling of open spaces.. Al-
though not explicitly stated, it is evident that he regarded the water
of his deep circulation as mainly of meteoric origin,

Of great practical value was the clear idea conveyed to the mind
of his readers of the distinction between the oxidized or altered min-
erals and the original or sulphide minerals of an ore deposit, a dis-
tinction previously pointed out, though less emphatically, by Em-
mons * and others.

In the same vear appeared the first of a series of important articles
on the formation of ore deposits by the Norwegian geologist, J. H. L.
Vogt, in which, as opposed to Posepny’ s views, so much more impor-
tance is given to igneous agencies that their different standpoints
recall the antagonisms of the old Neptunist and Plutonic schools.
The petrographic studies of Vogt and Brégger had disclosed in basic
dikes a tendency of the heavier impale to concentrate near the
borders. Following out the suggestion offered by this observation,
Vogt had proved by field study that certain titaniferous iron ores
were actual segregations in the eruptive magma previous to its final
consolidation. Based on petrographic studies made by Brégger and
himself, and personal observations on ore deposits, principally in
Norway, Vogt defined two methods of formation of ore deposits as
the direct result of igneous action:

1. By magmatic segregation.

2, By eruptive after-action of pneumatolysis (a term first used by
sunsen to describe the combined action of gases and water).

In the first class (of admittedly infrequent occurrence) are titanif-
erous iron ores, chromite, and other metallic segregations in basic
eruptive rocks. In the second class, commencing with tin and apatite
veins. he included, as time went on, increasingly numerous types of

THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 333

deposits. This was in one sense a revival of de Beaumont’s theories,
but the modern standpoint differed in that the existence of a liquid
molten interior of the earth had been disproved by terrestrial physi:
cists. Vogt held that as no communication could be established
between ore deposits and a heavy interior, they must have been
derived from a crust, say. 10, 25, or 50 kilometers in thickness, and in
great measure the result of eruptive processes within that crust.

Emmons (in 1893) acknowledged the importance of the magmatic
concentrations of metals in eruptive rock, but thought that in most
cases such accumulations must have been further concentrated in
order to produce economically valuable ore deposits.

During the second decade the influence of Posepny’s paper was
felt in an increased adherence among outside geologists and mining
engineers to the ascension theory. Vogt’s views received less atten-
tion in this country, because for a long time no ore deposits were
studied to which they were found to be applicable. The first case
was that of the titaniferous magnetites of the Adirondacks studied
by Kemp, who published his results in 1898.

The year 1900 was rendered important in the progress of theo-
‘retical views on ore deposition by the simultaneous appearance of
Principles Controlling Deposition of Ores, by Van Hise; Secondary
Enrichment, by Emmons and Weed, and Metasomatic Processes, by
Lindgren, and by the discussions which they prompted.

Van Hise’s article was a broad, philosophic treatment, based on
experimental data, of the whole question of underground circulation
as bearing on ore deposition. It would be impracticable to give here
any complete abstract of his paper, which is probably familiar to
most of you, and only a brief statement of such points as bear on the
general processes heretofore alluded to will be attempted. His dis-
cussion is practically confined to ore bodies deposited from aqueous
solutions, which, he considers, embrace the larger proportion of
workable deposits, and he holds that the waters from which these
deposits have been made are chiefly of meteoric origin. Their circu-
lation is In part descending, in part lateral moving, and in part
ascending, and during each of these movements they may take up
or deposit metallic minerals according as conditions favor either
action. This circulation takes place in openings in rocks, mostly pro-
duced by fracture, and hence is confined to the outer portion of the
crust, which he has defined as a zone of fracture as distinguished
from a deeper zone, that of flowage, where, under accumulated
pressure, deformation produces no macroscopic openings. Its gen-
eral tendency is to concentrate from the small openings into larger or
trunk channels. The deposits from these waters are distingutshed
as concentrations (1) from ascending waters alone; (2) from de-
scending waters alone, and (3) first from ascending and second from

descending waters. In prevailing composition the first class are
sulphides, tellurides, etc.; the second oxides or oxide salts, while the
third are chiefly the one or the other, according as they were formed
above or below the ground-water level.

Emmons and Weed, coming to the subject from a different but
somewhat narrower standpoint—that of a practical field study,
extending over several years—explained the frequent occurrence of
bonanzas, or exceptionally rich portions of deposits just below the
oxidized zone or ground-water level, as the result of leaching by sur-
face waters of the upper portions of these deposits and their redepo-
sition as sulphides in contact with preexisting metallic sulphides
(especially pyrite) in the zone below. Through similar processes of
chemical reasoning and with a similar disregard of Posepny’s
assumption that the ground-water level forms an effective barrier
separating the action of the surface or vadose waters from that of
the deep circulation, all three arrived at the same general conclusion
with regard to the continuance of rich ore in depth, a question which
has occupied the attention of geologists and miners since the days of
Werner. This conclusion was that in most ore deposits a deeper
region exists beyond the influence of surface waters in which the ore
is of comparatively low and uniform grade. Van Hise even went
so far as to say that in depth all deposits would become low-grade
pyritic ores, and that all veins would eventually wedge out.

De Launay, in his generalizations on Mexican deposits, had already
recognized three zones: (1) an upper oxidized zone, (2) a middle
zone of rich sulphides, and (3) a lower zone of low-grade sulphides.
He assumed the enrichment of the middle zone had been by descend-
ing waters, but placed it above the ground-water or hydrostatic level,
which in many veins had probably been displaced since their original
formation.

In his article * On metasomatic processes in fissure veins,” Lindgren
placed this theory for the first time on a scientific basis of chemical
and microscopical study, and by a classification of veins according to
the predominant metasomatic mineral or process involved he made its
application much clearer to the student and observer. In his closing
remarks he suggested that of late sufficient attention had not been
given to the French theory of emanations from eruptive magmas, and
that in the case of metals with low critical temperature they nay have
first been carried up under pneumatolytic conditions and with the aid
of mineralizers while still above the critical temperature, until they
reached the zone of circulating atmospheric waters.

His paper “ On contact deposits,” 1901, following out this sug-
gestion, served a useful genetic purpose by calling attenticn to and
clearly defining a group of deposits for which a pneumatolytic origin
would readily be admitted, but of which no important examples had
THEORIES OF ORE DISPOSITION HISTORICALLY CONSIDERED. 335

yet been studied in America. The term “ contact deposits,” which
had hitherto been loosely apphed to all deposits, without regard to
origin, which happened-to He near the contact of any two bodics of
rock, was restricted by his definition to those occurring near the con-
tact of igneous intrusives with calcareous beds. They are character-
ized by irregularity of form, the association of iron oxide and
sulphides of the metals with various hme silicates, generally called
* contact * minerals because they are found to be the result of contact
metamorphism. Typical developments of these contact minerals
near Christiania in Norway, in the Banat in Servia, in Tyrol, Italy,
and elsewhere had been the subject of repeated study and discussion
among European geologists since the nuddle of the century, but the
metallic deposits connected with them being generally of subordinate
economic importance had, up to the time of Vogt, not been considered
worthy of a distinct place in the classification of ore deposits.

The importance of pneumatolysis in forming ore deposits was em-
phasized by the discovery on this continent, soon after the publication
of Lindgren’s paper, of a number of economically important deposits,
especially of copper, which would come within his definition of con-
tact. deposits.

From a more theoretical point of view the contemporaneous paper
of Kemp, * The role of igneous rocks in the formation of veins,” pre-
sented a more decided opposition to the view so emphatically voiced
by Van Hise, that the majority of our ore deposits have been formed
by precipitation from circulating waters of original meteoric origin.
In this Kemp maintains that ground-water circulation is not sufficient
to account for the majority of ore deposits, but that igneous rocks
must have furnished not only their metallic contents. but a large, if
not predominating, proportion of the waters which brought them into
their present position.

The controversy which had thus arisen as to the relative importance
in the formation of ore deposits of waters of meteoric or of igneous
origin has more recently received a further impulse in the discussions
provoked by the presentation of proposed genetic classifications of ore
deposits by W. H. Weed and J. E. Spurr. These geologists took an
even more advanced position than Vogt in regard to the direct influ-
ence of igneous agencies in the formation of ore deposits, adding
siliceous segregations to his class of magmatic differentiation products
and very greatly enlarging the scope of his pneumatolytic class. The
influence of these new views is already seen in the current literature
on ore deposits, especially in articles where the author, though not in
possession of full data, still feels it incumbent upon him to present
some tentative hypothesis of origin for the deposits which he is
describing.

RESULTS ACHIEVED.

The wide divergence of views shown by these discussions to be held
by recognized authorities on the subject might lead one to conclude
that we are as far as ever from a universal agreement on accepted
theories. A more deliberate consideration of the progress of investi-
gation and verification during this last period, which has been but too
briefly and imperfectly set forth in the preceding pages, will show,
however, that the advance in this direction has been real and perma-
nent as far as regards the later stages of ore formation, which are
more susceptible of actual proof, and that the disagreement lies rather
with the ultimate or more theoretical sources of derivation, which
must always remain to some extent matters of opinion.

ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND

By Doucias W. FRESHFIELD.

We have all of us seen hills, or what we call hills, from the mon-
strous protuberances of the Andes and the Himalaya to such puny
pimples as le about the edges of the Cambridge fens. Next to a
waterfall, the first natural object (according to my own experience)
to impress itself on a child’s mind is a hill, some spot from which he
‘an enlarge his horizon. Hills, and still more mountains, attract the
human imagination and curiosity. The child soon asks, ‘Tell me,
how were mountains made?” a question easier to ask than to
answer, which occupied the lifetime of the father of mountain
science, De Saussure. But there are mountains and mountains.
Of all natural objects the most impressive is a vast snowy peak

rising as a white island above the waves of green hills—a

fragment of the arctic world left behind to commemorate its

past) predominance—and bearing on its broad shoulders a gar-
land of the alpine flora that has been destroyed on the lower
ground by the rising tide of heat and drought that succeeded the last
glacial epoch. Midsummer snows, whether seen from the slopes of
the Jura or the plains of Lombardy, above the waves of the EKuxine
or through the glades of the tropical forests of Sikhim, stir men’s
Imaginations and rouse their curiosity. Before, however, we turn to
consider some of the physical aspects of mountains, I shall venture,
speaking as Iam here to a terary audience and in a university town,
to dwell for a few minutes on their place in literature—in the mirror
that reflects in turn the mind of the passing ages. For geography is
concerned with the interaction between man and Nature in its widest

sense. There has been recently a good deal of writing on this sub-
yect—I can not say of discussion, for of late years writers have gen-
erally taken the same view. That view is that the love of mountains
is an invention of the nineteenth century, and that in previous ages
they had been generally looked on either with indifference or positive

dishke, rising in some instances to abhorrence. Extreme examples
have been repeatedly quoted. We have all heard of the bishop who
thought the devil was allowed to put in mountains after the fall of
man; of the English scribe in the tenth century who invoked “ the
bitter blasts of glaciers and the Pennine host of demons” on the
violators of the charters he was employed to draft. The examples on
the other side have been comparatively neglected. It seems time they
were insisted on.

The view I hold firmly, and which I wish to place before you to-day,
is that this popular belief that the love of mountains is a taste, or, as
some would say, a mania of advanced civilization, is erroneous. On
the contrary, I allege it to be a healthy, primitive, and almost uni-
versal human instinct. I think I can indicate how and why the
opposite belief has been fostered by eminent writers. They have
taken too narrow a time limit for their investigation. They have
compared the nineteenth century not with the preceding ages, but
with the eighteenth. They have also taken too narrow a space limit.
They have hardly cast their eyes beyond western Europe. Within
their own limits I agree with them. The eighteenth century was, as
we all know, an age of formality. It was the age of Palladian porti-
coes, of interminable avenues, of formal gardens, and formal style
in art, in literature, and in dress. Mountains, which are essentially
romantic and Gothic, were naturally distasteful toit. The artist says,
“they will not compose,” and they became obnoxious to a generation
that adored composition, that thought more of the cleverness of the
artist than of the aspects of nature he used as the material of his
work. There is a great deal to be said for the century; it pro-
duced some admirable results. It was a contented and material
century, little stirred by enthusiasms and aspirations and vague
desires. It was a phase in human progress, but in many respects it
was rather a reaction than a development from what had gone before.
Sentiment and taste have their tides like the sea, or, we may here
perhaps more appropriately say, their oscillations like the glaciers.
The imagination-of primitive man abhors a void: it peoples the
regions it finds uninhabitable with. aery sprites, with “ Pan and
father Sylvanus and the sister nymphs; ” it worships on high places
and reveres them as the abode of Deity. Christianity came and
denounced the vague symbolism and personification of nature in
which the pagan had recognized and worshipped the Unseen. It
found the objects of its devotion not in the external world, but in the
highest moral qualities of man. Delphi heard the ery, “ Great Pan
is dead!” But the voice was false. Pan is immortal. Every. vil-
Jager justifies etymology by remaining more or less of a pagan. Other
than villagers have done the same. The monk driven out of the
world by its wickedness fell in love with the wilderness in which he
ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND. 339

sought refuge, and soon learned to give practical proof of his love of
scenery by his choice of sites for his religious houses. But the litera-
ture of the eighteenth century was not written by monks or country-
men, or by men of world-wide curiosity and adventure like the
Italians of the Renaissance or our Elizabethans. It was the product
of a practical common-sense epoch which looked on all waste places,
heaths hke Hindhead, or hills like the Highlands, as blemishes in the
scheme of the universe, not having yet recognized their final purpose
as golf links or gymnasiums. Intellectual life was concentrated in cities
and courts; 1t despised the country. Books were written by towns-
men, dwellers in towns which had not grown into vast cities, and
whose denizens therefore had not the longing to escape from their
homes into purer air that we have to-day. They abused the Alps
frankly. But all they saw of them was the comparatively dull car-
riage passes, and these they saw at the worst time of year. Hasten-
ing to Rome for Easter, they traversed the Maurienne while the
ground was still brown with frost and patched untidily with half-
melted snowdrifts. It is no wonder that Gray and Richardson, hav-
ing left spring in the meadows and orchards of Chambéry, grumbled
ut the wintry aspect of Lanslebourg.

That at the end of the eighteenth century a lterary lady of western
Kurope should have preferred a Paris gutter to the lake of Genev:
is an amusing caricature of the spirit of the age that was passing
away, but it is no proof that the love of mountains is a new mania
and that all earlier ages and peoples looked on them with indifference
or dishke. Wordsworth and Byron and Scott in this country,
Rousseau and Goethe, De Saussure and his school abroad broke the
ice, but it was the ice of a winter frost, not of a glacial period.

Consider for a moment the literature of the two people who have
most influenced European thought—the Jews and the Greeks. I need
hardly quote a book that before people quarreled over education was
known to every child—the Bible. I would rather refer you to a
delightful poem in rhyming German verse, written in the seventeenth
century, by a Swiss author, Rebman, yn which he relates all the great
things that happened on mountains in Jewish history; how Solomon
enjoyed his Sommerfrische on Lebanon; how Moses disappeared
on a mountain top and Elias was looked for among the mountains;
how kings and prophets found their help among the hills; how
closely the hills of Palestine are connected with the story of the
Gospels.

Consider, again, Greece, where I have just been wandering. Did
the Greeks pay no regard to their mountains? They seized eagerly
on any striking piece of hill scenery and connected it with a legend
ora shrine. They took their highest mountain, broad-backed Olym-
pus, for the’ home of the gods; their most conspicuous mountain,
340 ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND.

Parnassus, for the home of poetry. They found in the cliffs of
Delphi a dwelling for their greatest oracle and a center for their
patriotism. One who has lately stood on the top of Parnassus and
seen the first rays of the sun as it springs from the waves of the
.Hgean strike its snows, while Attica and Beeotia and Euboea still lay
in deep shadow under his feet, will appreciate the famous lines of
Sophocles, which I will not quote, as I am uncertain how you may
pronounce Greek in this university. You may remember, too, that
Lucian makes Hermes take Charon, when he has a day out from hell,
to the twin-crested summit and show him the panorama of land and
sea, of rivers and famous cities. The Vale of Tempe, the deep gap
between Olympus and Ossa, beautiful in its great red cliffs, fountains,
and spreading plane trees, was part of a Roman’s classical tour.
The superb buttresses in which Taygetus breaks down on the valley
of the Eurotas were used by the Spartans for other purposes besides
the disposal of criminals and weakly babies. The middle regions—
the lawns above the Langada Pass, “ virginibus bacchata Laceenis
Taygeta ”—are frequented to this day as a summer resort by Spartan
damsels. The very top, the great rock that from a height of 8,000
feet looks down through its woods of oaks and Aleppo pines on the

iwin bays of the southern sea, is a place of immemorial pilgrimages.
It is now oecupied by a chapel framed in a tiny court, so choked with
snow at the beginning of June that I took the ridge of the chapel
roof for a dilapidated stoneman. I have no time to-day to look for
evidence in classical literature, to refer to the discriminating epithets
applied in it to mountain scenes.

A third race destined apparently to play a great part in the
world’s history—the Japanese—are ancient mountain lovers. We
are all aware that Fusiyama to the Japanese is (as Ararat to the

Armenians) a national symbol; that its ascent is constantly inade
by bands of pilgrims; that it is depicted in every aspect. Those who
have read the pleasant book of Mr. Weston, who, us Hnglish chaplain
for some years at Kobi, had exceptional opportunities of travel in
the interior, will remember how often he met with shrines and tem-
ples on the summits of the mountains, and how he found pilgrims
who frequented them in the belief that they fell there more readily
into spiritual trances. The Japanese minister when he attended
Mr. Weston’s lecture at the Alpine Club, told us that his countrymen
never climbed mountains without a serious—that is to say, a relig-
ious—object.

India and China would add to my evidence had I knowledge and
time enough to refer to their literature. I remember Tennyson
pointing out to me, in a volume of translations from the Chinese, a
poem, written about the date of our King Alfred, in praise of a
picture of a mountain landscape. But I must return to the six-

teenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe; I may go earlier—even
back to Dante. His ‘allusions to mountain scenery are frequent;
his Virgil had all the craft of an Alpine rock climber. Read Leon-
ardo da Vinei’s Notes, Conrad Gesner’s Ascent of Pilatus; study
the narratives of the Alpine precursors Mr. Coolidge has collected
and annotated with admirable industry in the prodigious volume
he has recently brought out.¢

It is impossible for me here to multiply proofs of my argument,
to quote even a selection from the passages that show an authentic
enthusiasm for mountains that may be culled from writers of vari-
ous nations prior to 1600 a. p. JT must content myself with the
following specimens which will probably be new to most of my
hearers,

Benoit Marti was a professor of Greek and Hebrew at Bern, and
a friend of the great Conrad Gesner (TI call him great, for he com-
bined the qualities of a man of science and a man of letters, was one
of the fathers of botany as well as of mountaineering, and was,
in his many sidedness, a typical figure of the Renaissance). Marti,
in the year 1558 or 1559, wrote as follows of the view from his native
Citys:

*'Phese are the mountains which form our pleasure and delight ”
(the Latin is better—* delici nostra, nostrique amores”) “ when
we gaze at them from the higher parts of our city and admire their
mighty peaks and broken crags that threaten to fall at any moment.

Here we watch the risings and settings of the sun and seek signs: of
the weather. In them we find food not only for our eyes and our
minds but also for our bellies;” and he goes on to enumerate the
dairy products of the Oberland and the happy life of its population.
I quote again this good man: “ Who, then, would not admire, love.
willingly visit, explore, and climb places of this sort? I assuredly
should call those who are not attracted by them mushrooms, stupid,
dull fishes, and slow tortoises” (* fungos, stupidos insulsos pisces,
lentosque chelones”). “In truth, I can not describe the sort of
affection and natural love with which I am drawn to mountains,
so that Tam never happier than on the mountain crests, and there
are no wanderings dearer to me than those on the mountains.”
“They are the theater of the Lord, displaying monuments of past
ages, such as precipices, rocks, peaks, and chasms, and never-melting
glaciers; and so on through many eloquent paragraphs.

I will only add two sentences from the preface to Simler’s Vallesia
et Alpium Descriptio, first published in 1574, which seem to me a
strong piece of evidence in favor of my view: * In the entire district,

and particularly in the very lofty ranges by which the Vallais is on all
sides surrounded, wonders of nature offer themselves to our view and
admiration. With my countrymen, many of them have through
familiarity lost their attraction; but foreigners are overcome at the
mere sight of the Alps, and regard as marvels what we through habit
pay no attention to.”

Mr. Coolidge, in his singularly interesting footnotes, goes on to
show that the books that remain to us are not isolated instances of a
feeling for mountains in the age of the Renaissance. The mountains
themselves bear, or once bore, records even more impressive. Most of
us have climbed to the picturesque old castle at Thun and seen beyond
the rushing Aar the green heights of the outposts of the Alps, the
Stockhorn, and the Niesen. Our friend Marti, who climbed the
former peak about 1558, records that he found on the summit * tituh,

auctorum. Inter alia cujusdam docti et montium ameoenitate capti

“'The love of mountains is best.” In those five words some Swiss
professor anticipated the doctrine of Ruskin and the creed of Leslie
Stephen, and of all men who have found mountains the best compan-
ions in the vicissitudes of life.

In the annals of art it would be easy to find additional proof of the
attention paid by men to mountains three to four hundred years ago.
The late Josiah Gilbert, in a charming but too little-known volume,
Landseape in Art, has shown how many great painters depicted in
their backgrounds their native hills. Titian is the most conspicuous
example.

It will perhaps be answered that this love of mountains led to no
practical result, bore no visible fruit, and therefore can have been but
a sickly plant. Some of my hearers may feel inclined to point out
that it was left to the latter half of the nineteenth century to found
climbers’ clubs. It would take too long to adduce all the practical
reasons which delayed the appearance of these fine fruits of peace and
an advanced civilization. I am content to remind you that the love
of mountains and the desire to climb them are distinct tastes. They
are often united, but their union is accidental, not essential. A pas-
sion for golf does not necessarily argue a love of levels. I would sug-
gest that more outward and visible signs than is generally imagined
of the familar relations between men and mountains in early times
may be found. The choicest spots in the Alpine region—Chamonix,
Engelberg, Disentis, Eimsiedlen, Pesio, the Grande Chartreuse—were
seized on by recluses; the Alpine Baths were in full swing at quite

ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND. 3438

an early date. I will not count the Swiss Baden, of which a geog-
‘apher, who was also a~pope, Adneas Silvius (Pius IL), records the
attractions, for it is in'the Jura, not the Alps; but Pfifers, where
wounded warriors went to be healed, was a scene of dissipation, and
the waters of St. Moritz were vaunted as superseding wine. I may
be excused, since I wrote this particular passage myself a good many
years ago, for quoting a few sentences bearing on this point from
Murray’s Handbook to Switzerland. ‘“ In the sixteenth century fifty
treatises dealing with twenty-one different resorts were published. St.
Moritz, which had been brought into notice by Paracelsus (died 1541),
was one of the most famous baths. In 1501 Matthew Schinner, the
famous Prince Bishop of Sion, built *a magnificent hotel? at Leuker-
bad, to which the wealthy were carried up in panniers on the back of
mules. Brieg, Gurnigel, near Bern, the Baths of Masino, Tarasp,
and Pfiifers were also popular in early times. Leonardo da Vinei
mentions the Baths of Bormio, and Gesner went there.”

It is not, however, with the emotional influences or the picturesque
aspect of mountains that science concerns itself, but with their phys-
ical examination. If I have lingered too long on my preamble [ can
only plead as an excuse that a love of one’s subject is no bad qualifi-
‘ation for dealing with it, and that it has tempted me to endeavor to
show you grounds for believing that a love of mountains is no modern
affectation, but a feeling as old and as widespread as humanity.

Their scientific investigation has naturally been of comparatively
modern date. There are a few passages about the effects of altitude,
there are orographical descriptions more or less accurate in the
authors of antiquity. But for attempts to explain the origin of
mountains, to investigate and account for the details of their struc-
ture, we shall find little before the notes of Leonardo da Vinel, that
marvelous man, who combined, perhaps, more than any one who has
ever lived the artistic and the scientific mind. His ascent of Monte
Boso about 1511, a mountain which may be found under this name on
the Italian ordnance map on the spur separating Val Sesia and the
Biellese, was the first ascent by a physical observer. Gesner, with all
his mountain enthusiasm, found a scientific interest in the Alps
mainly, if not solely, in their botany.

The phenomenon which first drew men of science to Switzerland
was the Grindelwald glaciers—* miracles of nature ” they called them.
Why these glaciers in particular, you may ask, when there are so
many in the Alps? The answer is obvious. Snow and ice on the
“mountain tops that freeze” are no miracle. But when two great
tongues of ice were found thrusting themselves down among meadows
and corn and cottages, upsetting barns and covering fields, and even
the marble quarries from which the citizens of Bern dug their man-

.
344 ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND.

telpieces, there was obviously something outside the ordinary proc-
esses of nature, and therefore miraculous.

Swiss correspondents communicated with the Royal Society the
latest news as to the proceedings of these unnnatural ice monsters,
while the wise men of Ziirich and Bern wrote lectures on them.
Glacier theories began. Early in the eighteenth century Hottinger,
Cappeller, Scheuchzer, that worthy man who got members of our
Royal Society to pay for his pictures of flying dragons, contributed
their quota of crude speculation. But it was not till 1741 that Mont
Blane and its glaciers were brought into notoriety by our young
countrymen, Pococke and Windham, and became an attraction to the
mind and an object to the ambition of the student whose name was
destined to be associated with them. Horace Benedict de Saussure,
born of a scientific family, the nephew of Bonnet, the Genevese botan-
ist and philosopher, who has become known to the world as a moun-
taineer and the climber of Mont Blane, came twenty years later. In
truth, he was far more of a mountain traveler and a scientific observer,
a geological student, than a climber. When looking at his purple
sill frock coat (carefully preserved in his country house on the shore
of the Lake of Geneva) one realizes the difference between the man
who climbed Mont Blane in that garment and the modern gymnast,
who thinks himself par excellence the mountaineer.

De Saussure did not confine himself to Savoy or to one group; he
wandered far and wide over the Alpine region, and the four volumes
of his voyages contain, besides the narratives of his sojourn on the
Col du Géant and the ascent of Mount Blanc, a portion of the fruit of
these wanderings.

The reader who would appreciate De Saussure’s claim as the
founder of the scientific exploration of mountains must, however, be
referred to the List of Agenda on questions calling for investigation
placed at the end of his last volume. They explain the comparative
indifference shown by De Saussure to the problems connected with
glacial movement and action. His attention was absorbed in the
larger question of earth structure, of geology, to which the sections
exposed by mountains offered, he thought, a key; he was bitten by
the contemporary desire for “a theory of the earth,” by the taste of
the time for generalizations for which the facts were not always
ready. At the same time, his own intellect was perhaps somewhat
deficient in the intuitive faculty—the grasp of the possible or prob-
able bearing of known facts by which the greatest discoverers sug-
gest theories first and prove them afterwards.

The school of De Saussure at Geneva died out after having pro-
duced Bourrit, the tourist who gloried in being called the historian
of the Alps, a man of pleasant self-conceit and warm enthusiasm, and
De Lue, a mechanical inventor, who ended his life as reader to Queen
ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND: 345

Charlotte at Windsor, where he flits across Miss Burney’s pages as
the friend of Herschel“at Slough and the jest of tipsy royal dukes.
Oddly enough, the first sound guess as to glacier movement was made
by one Bordier, who had no scientific pretensions. I reprinted many
years ago the singular passage in which he compared glacier ice to
“cire amollie.” soft wax, “ flexible et ductile jusqu’& un certain
point,” and described it as flowing in the manner of liquids (A/p. J/.,
TX, 327). He added this remarkable suggestion, foreshadowing the
investigations of Professor Richter and M. Forel: “ It is very de-
sirable that there should be at Chamonix some one capable of observ-
ing the glaciers for a series of years and comparing their advance
and oscillations with meteorological records.” To the school of
Geneva succeeded the school of Neuchatel, Desor and Agassiz; the
feat of De Saussure was rivaled on the Jungfrau and the Finster-
aarhorn by the Meyers of Bern. They in turn were succeeded by the
British school, Forbes and Tyndall, Reilly and Wills, in 1840-1860.
In 1857 the Alpine Club was founded in this country. In the half
century since that date the nations of western Europe have emulated
one another in forming similar bodies, one of the objects of which has
been to collect and set in order information as to the mountains and to
further their scientific as well as their geographical exploration.
What bowlders, or rather pebbles, can we add to the enormous mo-
a moraine the hghter portions of

raine of modern Alpine literature
which it is to be hoped, for the sake of posterity, that the torrent of
time may speedily make away with ?

For fifty years I have loved and at frequent intervals wandered and
climbed in the Alps. I have had something of a grand passion for
the Caucasus. Iam on terms of visiting acquaintance with the Pyre-
nees and the Himalaya, the Apennines and the Algerian Atlas, the
mountains of Greece, Syria, Corsica, and Norway. I will try to set
in order some observations and comparisons suggested by these va-
rious experiences.

As one travels east from the Atlantic through the four great ranges
of the Old World the peaks grow out not only in absolute height but
also in abruptness of form and in elevation above the connecting
ridges. The snow and ice region increases in a corresponding man-
ner. The Pyrenees have few fine rock peaks except the Pie du Midi
VOssau; its chief glacier summits, the Vignemale, Mont Perdu, the
Maladetta, correspond to the Tiths or the Buet in the Alps. The
peaks of the Alps are infinite in their variety and admirable in their
clear-cut outlines and graceful curves. But the central group of the
Caucasus, that which culminates in Dykhtau, Koshtantau, and Shkara,
17,000 feet summits (KKoshtantau falls only 120 feet below this figure),
has even more stately peaks than those that cluster round Zermatt.

will find the scale increased ; Siniolchum, Jannu, and Kangchenjunga
are all portentious giants. To put it at a low average figure, the cliffs
of their final peaks are half as high again as those of Monte Rosa and
the Matterhorn.

In all these chains you will find the same feature of watershed or
partings lying not in but behind the geological axis, which is often
the line of greatest peak elevation. This is the case in the Alps at
the St. Gothard, in the Caucasus for some 40 miles west of the Dariel
Pass, in the Himalaya, in Sikhim and Nepal, where the waters flow-
ing from the Tibetan Plateau slowly eat their way back behind
Kangchenjunga and the Nepalese snows. The passes at their sources
are found consequently to be of the mildest character—hills * like
Wiltshire Downs,” is the description given by a military explorer.
It needs no great stretch of geological imagination to believe in the
cutting back of the southern streams of Sikhim or the Alps, as for
instance at the Maloya; but I confess that I can not see how the
gorges of Ossetia, clefts cut through the central axis of the Caucasus,
can be ascribed mainly to the action of water.

I turn to the snow and ice region. Far more snow is deposited on
the heights of the central Caucasus and the eastern Himalaya than
on the Alps. It remains plastered on their precipices, forming
hanging glaciers everywhere of the kind found on the northern, the
Wengern Alp, face of the Jungfrau. Such a peak as the Weisshorn
looks poor and bare compared with Tetnuld in the Caucasus or Siniol-
chum in the Himalaya. The plastered sheets of snow between their
great bosses of ice are perpetually melting, their surfaces are grooved,
so as to suggest fluted armor, by tiny avalanches and runnels.

In the Aletsch glacier the Alps have a champion with which the
Caucasus can not compete; but apart from this single exception the
Caucasian glaciers are superior to the Alpine in extent and pictur-
esqueness. Their surfaces present the features familiar to us in the
Alps— ice falls, moulins, and earth cones.

In Sikhim, on the contrary, the glaciers exhibit many novel fea-
tures, due, no doubt, mainly to the great sun heat. In the lower por-
tion their surface is apt to be covered with the débris that has fallen
from the impending cliffs, so that little or no ice is visible from any

distance. In the region below the névé there are very few crevasses,
the ice heaves itself along in huge and rude undulations, high, gritty
mounds, separated by hollows often occupied by yellow pools which
are connected by streams running in little icy ravines, a region excep-
tionally tiresome, but in no way dangerous to the explorer. In steep
places the alpine icefall is replaced by a feature I may best compare
with a series of earth pillars, such as are found near Evolena, in
Canton Valais, and elsewhere, and are figured in most text-books.
The ice is shaped into a multitude of thin ridges and spires, resem-

bling somewhat the, Nieves Penitentes of the Andes, though formed
in a different material. .~

Great sun heat acting on surfaces unequally protected, combined in
the latter case with the strain of sudden descent, is, no doubt, the
cause of both phenomena. Generally the peculiarities of the great
glaciers of Kangchenjunga may be attributed to a vertical sun, which
renders the frozen material less liable to crack, less rigid, and more
plastic.

A glacier, as a rule, involves a moraine. Now, moraines are largely
formed from the material contributed by subaerial denudation, in
plain words, by the action of heat and cold and moisture on the cliffs
that border them. It is what falls on glacier, not that which it falls
over, that mainly makes a moraine. The proof is that the moraines
of a glacier which flows under no impending cliffs are puny com-
pared with those of one that hes beneath great rockwalls.

Take, for example, the Norwegian glaciers of the Jostedals Brae
and compare them with the Swiss. The former, falling from a great
névé plain or snowfield, from which hardly a crag protrudes, are
models of cleanliness. I may cite, as examples, the three fascinating
glaciers of the Olden Valley. The Rosenlaui glacier in Switzerland
owed the cleanliness which gave it a reputation fifty years ago, before
its retirement from tourists’ tracks, to a similar cause
plateau, the Wetterkessel.

One peculiarity very noticeable both in the Himalaya and the
Caucasus I have never found satisfactorily accounted for. I refer
to the long, grassy trenches lying between the lateral moraine and the
hillside, which often seem to the mountain explorer to have been
made by Providence to form grass paths for his benefit. They may
possibly be due to the action of torrents falling from the hillside,
which, meeting the moraine and constantly sweeping along its base,
undermine it and keep a passage open for themselves. There are
remarkable specimens of this formation on both sides of the Bezingi
glacier, in the Caucasus, and on the north side of the Zemu glacier, in
Sikhim.

Water is one of the greatest features in mountain scenery. In
Norway it is omnipresent. In this respect Scandinavia is a region
apart; the streams of the more southern ranges are scanty compared
with those of a region where the snowfall of two-thirds of the year is
discharged in a few weeks. Greece stands at the oppesite pole. By
what seems a strange perversity of nature, its slender streams are apt
to disappear underground, to reissue miles away in the great foun-
tains that gave rise to so many legends. Arcadia is, for the most
part, a dry upland, sadly wanting in the two elements of pastoral
scenery, shady groves, and running brooks.

348 ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND.

The Alps are distinguished by their subalpine lakes—
Anne lacus tantos; te, Lari maxime, teque
Fluctibus et fremitu assurgens, Benace, marino?
of Virgil. But perhaps even more interesting to the student are the
lake basins that have been filled up, and thus suggest how similar
lakes may have vanished at the base of other ranges.

I know no more striking walk to any one interested in the past
doings of glaciers than that along the ridge of the mighty moraine of
the old glacier of Val d’Aosta, which sweeps out, a hill 500 feet high,
known as “ La Serra,” from the base of the Alps near Ivrea into the
plain of Piedmont. Inclosed in its folds still hes the Lago di Viv-
erone; but the Dora has long ago cut a gap in the rampart and
drained the rest of the inclosed space, filling it up with the alluvial
deposit of centuries.

It is, however, the tarns rather than the great lakes of the Alps
which have been the chief subjects of scientific disputation. Their
distribution 1s curious. They are found in great quantity in the Alps
and Pyrenees, hardly at all in the Caucasus, and comparatively rarely
in the part of the Himalaya I am acquainted with.

A large-scale map will show that where tarns are most thickly
dotted over the uplands the peaks rise to no great height above the
ridges that connect them. This would seem to indicate that there
has been comparatively little subaerial denudation in these districts,
and consequently less material has been brought down to fill the hol-
lows. Again, it is in gneiss and granitic regions that we find tarns
most abundant—that is, where the harder and more compact rocks
make the work of streams in tapping the basins more lengthy. The
‘arity of tarns in the highlands behind Kangchenjunga calls, per-
haps, for explanation. We came upon many basins, but, whether
formed by moraines or true rock basins, they had for the most part
been filled up by alluvial deposits.

In my opinion, the presence of tarns must be taken as an indica-
tion that the portion of the range where they are found has, until a
comparatively recent date, been under snow or ice. The former the-
ory, still held, was that the ice scooped out their basins from the solid
rock. I believe that it simply kept scoured preexisting basins. The
ice removed and the surrounding slopes left bare, streams on the one
hand filled the basins with sediment, or, on the other, tapped them by
cutting clefts in their rims. This theory meets, at any rate, all the
facts I have observed, and IT may point out that the actual process of
the destruction of tarns by such action may be seen going on under
our eyes in many places, notably in the glens of the Adamello group.
Professor Garwood has lately employed his holidays in sounding
many of the tarns of the St. Gotthard group, and his results, I under-
stand, tend to corroborate the conclusions stated.
ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND. 349

I desire here to reaffirm my conviction that snow and ice in the
High Alps are conservative agents; that they arrest the natural proc-
esses of suberial denudation; that the scouring work done by a gla-
cler Is Insignificant compared with the hewing and hacking of frost
and running water on slopes exposed to the open sky without a roof
of névé and glacier.

The contrast between the work of these two agents was forced upon
me many years ago while looking at the ground from which the Eiger
Glacier had then recently retreated. The rocks, it is true, had had
their angles rubbed off by the glacier, but through their midst, cut as
by a knife, was the deep slit or gash made by the subglacial torrent.
There is in the Alps a particular type of gorge, found at Rosenlaui,
at the Lower Grindelwald Glacier, at the Kirchet above Meiriugen,
and also in the Caucasus, within the curves of old terminal moraines.
Tt is obviously due to the action of the subglacial torrent, which cuts
deeper and deeper while the ice above protects the sides of the cut-
ting from the effects of the atmosphere.

One more note I have to make about glaciers. It has been stated
that glaciers go on melting in winter. Water, no doubt, flows from
under some of them, but that is not the same thing. The end of the
Rosenlaui Glacier is dry in January; you can jump across the clear
streams that flow from the Lower Grindelwald Glacier. That stream
is not meltings, but the issue of a spring which rises under the glacier
and does not freeze. There is another such stream on the way to the
Great Scheideck, which remains free when frost has fettered all its
neighbors.

I should like to draw your attention before we leave glaciers to the
systematic efforts that are being made on the Continent to extend our
knowledge of their peculiarities. ‘The subject has a literature of its
one in France, one in other countries—have

own, and two societies
been constituted to promote and systematize further investigations,
especially with regard to the secular and annual oscillations of the ice.
These were initiated by the English Alpine Club in 1893, while I was
its president. Subsequently, though the exertions of the late Mar-
shall Hall, an enthusiast on the subject, an international commission
of glaciers was founded, which has been presided over by Doctor
Richter, M. Forel, and others: and more recently a French commis-
sion, under M. Rabot, has been created with the object of studying
in detail the glaciers of the French Alps. A number of excellent
reports have been published, embodying information from all parts
of the globe. There has been, and is, I rgret to say, very great diffi-
culty in obtaining any methodical reports from the British posses-
sions oversea. The subject does not commend itself to the depart-
mental mind. Let us hope for improvement. I signalize the need
for it. Of course it is by no means always an easy matter to get the
350 ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND.

required measurements of retreat or advance in the glacial snout,
when the glacier is situated in a remote and only casually visited
region. Still, with good will more might be done than has been.
The periods of advance and retreat cf glaciers appear to correspond
to a certain extent throughout the globe. The middle of the last
century was the culmination of the last great advance. The general
estimate of their duration appears to be half a century. The ice is
now retreating in the Alps, the Caucasus, and the Himalaya, and
I believe in North America. We live in a retrogressive period. The
minor oscillation of advance which a few years ago gave hopes to
those who, like myself, had as children seen the glaciers of Grindel-
wald and Chamonix at their greatest, has not been carried on.

Attempts are being made to connect the oscillations of glaciers with
periods of sun spots. They are, of course, connected with the rain or
snow fall in past seasons. But the difficulty of working out the con-
nection 1s obvious.

The advance of the ice will not begin until the snows falling in its
upper basin have had time to descend as ice and become its snout. In
each glacier this period will vary according to its length, bulk, and
steepness, and the longer the glacier is the slower its lower extremity
will be to respond. Deficiency in snowfall will take effect after the
same period. It will be necessary, therefore, to ascertain (as has been
done in a tragic manner on Mont Blane by the recovery in the lowest
portion of the Glacier des Bossons of the bodies of those lost in its
highest snows) the time each glacier takes to travel, and to apply
this interval to the date of the year with which the statistics of deposi-
tion of moisture are to be compared. If the glacier shows anything
about weather and climate, it is past not contemporary weather it
indicates.

Another point in which the Asiatic ranges, and particularly the
Himalaya, differ from the Alps is in the frequency of snow ava-
lanches, earth falls, and mud slides. These are caused by the greater
deposition of snow and the more sudden and violent alternations of
heat and cold, which lead to the splitting of the hanging ice and
snows by the freezing of the water in their pores. I have noticed
about the rising

at a bivouac that the moment of greatest cold
of the morning star—is often hailed by the reports of a volley of
avalanches.

The botanist may find much to do in working out a comparison of
the flora of my four ranges. I am no botanist; I value flowers ac-
cording, not to their rarity, but to their abundance, from the artist’s,
not the collector’s, point of view. But it is impossible not to take
interest in such matters as the variations of the gentian in different
regions, the behavior of such a plant as the little edelweiss (once the
tol.en of the Tyrolese lover, now the badge of every Alp trotter),

which frequents the Alps, despises the Caucasus, reappears in masses
in the Himalaya, and then, leaping all the isles of the Tropics, turns
up again under the snows of New Zealand. T may mention that it is
a superstition that it grows only in dangerous places. IT have often
found it where cows can crop it; it covers acres in the Himalaya, and
I beheve it has been driven by cows off the Alpine pastures, as it is
being driven by tourists out of the Alps altogether.

The Italian botanists, Monsieurs Levier and Sommier, have given a
vivid account of what they call the makroflora of the Central Cau-
casus—those wild-flower beds, in which a man and a horse may
literally be lost to sight, the product of sudden heat on a rich and sod-
den soil composed of the vegetable mold of ages. Has any compe-
tent hand celebrated the mikroflora of the highest ridges, those tiny, .
vivid forget-me-nots and gentians and ranunculuses that flourish on
rock-island “ Jardins” like that of Mont Blane, among the eternal
snows, and enamel the highest rocks of the Basodano and the Lom-
bard Alps? A comprehensive work on a comparison of mountain
flora and the distribution of Alpine plants throughout the ranges of
the Old World would be welcome. We want another John Ball.
Allied to botany is forestry, and the influence of trees on rainfall, and
consequently on the face of the mountains, a matter of great impor-
tance, which in this country has hardly had the attention it deserves.

From these brief suggestions as to some of the physical features of
mountains I would ask you to turn your attention to the points in
which mankind come in contact with them, and first of all to History.

I fancy that the general impression that they have served as efficient
barriers is hardly in accordance with facts, at any rate from the mili-
tary point of view. Hannibal, Caesar, Charles the Great, and Napo-
leon passed the Alps successfully. Hannibal, it is true, had some
difficulty, but then he was handicapped with elephants. The Holy
Roman Emperors constantly moved forwards and backwards. Bur-
gundy, as the late Mr. Freeman was never weary of insisting, lay
across the Alps. So till our own day did the dominions of the House
of Savoy. North Italy has been in frequent connection with Ger-
many; it is only in my own time that the Alps have become a frontier
between France and Italy. But questions of this kind might lead us
too far. Let me suggest that some competent hand should compose
a history of the Alpine passes and their famous passages, more com-
plete than the treatises that have appeared in Germany. Mr. Cool-
1dge, to whom we owe so much, has. in his monumental collection and
reprint of early Alpine writers just published, thrown great light on
the extensive use of what I may call the by-passes of the Alps in early
times. Will he not follow up his work by treating of the great passes?
T may note that the result of the construction of carriage roads over
some of them was to concentrate tratlic: thus the Monte Moro and the
352 ON MOUNTAINS AND MANKIND.

Gries were practically deserted for commercial purposes when Napo-
leon opened the Simplon. The roads over the Juher and Maloya
ruined the Septimer. Another hint to those engaged in tracing
ancient lines of communication. In primitive times, in the Caucasus
to-day. the tendency of paths is to follow ridges not valleys. The mo-
tives are on the spot obvious—to avoid torrents, swamps, ravines,
earth falls, and to get out of the thickets and above the timber line.
The most striking example is the entrance to the great basin of Sua-
netia, which runs not up its river, the Ingur, but over a ridge of
nearly 9,000 feet, closed for eight months in the year to animals.

From the military point of view, mountains are now receiving
great attention in Central Europe. The French, the Italians, the
Swiss, the Austrians have extensive Alpine maneuvers every sum-
mer. in which men, mules, and light artillery are conveyed or car-
ried over rocks and snow. Officers are taught to use maps on the
spot, the defects in the official surveys being thus brought to light.
It is not likely, perhaps, except on the Indian frontier, that British
troops will have to fight among high snowy ranges. But I feel sure
that any intelligent officer who is allowed to attend such maneuvers
might pick up valuable hints as to the best equipment for use in
steep places. Probably the Japanese have already sent such an
envoy and profited by his experience.

A word as to maps, in which I have taken great interest, may be
allowed me. The ordnance maps of Europe have been made by
soldiers, or under the supervision of soldiers. At home, when I was
young, it was dangerous to hint at any defects in our ordnance
sheets, for surveyors in this country are a somewhat sensitive class.
Times have altered, and they are no longer averse from receiving
hints, and even help from unofficial quarters. Since the great sur-
veys of Europe were executed, knowledge has increased, so that every
country has had to revise or to do over again its surveys. In three
points that concern us there was great room for improvement—the
delineation of the upper region as a whole, the definition of snow
and glaciers in particular, and the selection of local names. In the
two former the federal staff at Bern has provided us with an incom-
parable model. The number of local names known to each peasant
is small, his pronunciation is often obscure, and each valley is apt
to have its own set of names for the ridges and gaps that form its
skyline. Set a stranger, speaking another tongue than the local
patois, to question a herdsman, and the result is likely to be unsatis-
factory. It has often proved so. The Zardezan is an odd tran-
scription of the Gias del Cian of patois, the Gite du Champ in
French. The Grand Paradis is the last term an Aostan peasant
would have used for the Granta Parei, the great sereen of rock and
ice of the highest mountain in Italy. The Pointe de Rosablanche

was the Roesa Bianca, or white glacier. Monte Rosa herself though
the poet sees a reference to the rose of dawn, and the German pro-
fessor detects “ the Keltic ros, a promontory,” is a simple translation
of the Gletscher Mons of Simler, or rather Simler’s hybrid term is
a translation of Monte della Roesa. Roesa, or Ruize, is the Val
V’Aostan word for glacier, and may be found in De Saussure’s
Voyages.

TI would urge mountain explorers to attempt in more distant lands
what the late Messrs. Adams-Reilly and Nichols, Mr. Tuckett, and
Lieutenant Payer (of Arctic fame) did forty years ago with so much
success In the Alps, what the members of the Swiss Alpine Club have
done lately, take a district, and, working from the trigonometrically
fixed points of a survey, where one exists, fill it in by plane tabling
with the help of the instruments for photographic and telephoto-
graphic surveying, in the use of which Mr. Reeves, the map curator
to the Royal Geographical Society, is happy to give instruction. -An
excellent piece of work of this kind has been done by Mr. Stein in
Central Asia.

There are, I know, some old-fashioned persons in this country who
dispute the use of photography in mountain work. It can only be
because they have never given it a full and fair trial with proper
instruments.

Lastly, I come to a matter on which we may hope before long to
have the advantage of medical opinion, based for the first time on a
large number of cases. I refer to the effects of high altitudes on the
human frame and the extent of the normal diminution in force as men
ascend. The advance to Lhasa ought to do much to throw light on
this interesting subject. I trust the Indian Government has taken
eare that the subject shall be carefully investigated by experts. The
experience of most mountaineers (including my own) in the last few
years has tended to modify our previous belief that bodily weakness
increases more or less regularly with increasing altitude. Mr. White,
the British resident in Sikhim, and my party both found on the bor-
ders of Tibet that the feelings of fatigue and discomfort that mani-
fested themselves at about 14,000 to 16,000 feet tended to diminish as
we climbed to 20,000 or 21,000 feet. I shall always regret that when
T was traveling in 1899 on the shoulders of Kangchenjunga the excep-
tional snowfall altogether prevented me from testing the point at
which any of our ascents were stopped by the discomforts due to the
atmosphere. Owing to the nature of the footing, soft snow lying on
hard, it was more difficult to walk uphill than on a shingly beach;
and it was impossible for us to discriminate between the causes of
exhaustion.

Here I must bring this, I fear, desultory address to an end. I

might easily have made it more purely geographical. if it 13 geog-
raphy to furnish a mass of statistics that are better and more intelli-
gibly given by a map. I might have dwelt on my own explorations
in greater detail, or have summarized those of my friends of the Al-
pine Club. But I have done all this elsewhere in books or reviews,
and I am unwilling to inflict it for a second time on any of my hearers
who may have done me the honor to read what I have written. Look-
ing back, I find I have been able to communicate very little of value,
yet I trust I may have suggested to some of my audience what oppor-
tunities mountains offer for scientific cbservations to mountaineers
better qualified in science than the present speaker, and how far we
scouts or pioneers are from having exhausted even our Alpine play-
ground as a field for intelhgent and systematic research.

And even if the value to others of his travels may be doubtfu!, the
Alpine explorer is sure of his reward. What has been said of books
is true also of mountamns—they are the best of friends. Poets and
geologists may proclaiinm—

The hills are shadows, and they flow
From form to form, and nothing stands!

But for us creatures of a day the great mountains stand fast, Jung-
frau and Mont Blane do not change. Through all the vicissitudes of
life we find them sure and sympathetic companions. Let me conclude
with two lines which I copied from a tomb in Santa Croce at
Florence :

Hue properate, viri, salebrosum scandite montem,

MOROCCO.

By THEOBALD FISCHER.

To the man of general culture the word “ Morocco” calls up a
vague notion of a country in the northwest corner of Africa, and even
among the better informed a clear idea does not prevail that under the
name * Morocco ” is comprehended a group of countries and districts
quite loosely tied together only by religious bonds, and that only a
few of these constitute a sort of political union, the boundaries of
which are ever changing, and which owes its existence to the domi-
nant natural feature of the country, the Atlas range. The govern-
ment and the people, perhaps for different reasons, have been alike
at all times in maintaining the most distant attitude toward Euro-
peans.

It has been only within the last twenty years that we have suc-
ceeded in throwing light upon even the main features of this extreme
portion of the Dark Continent. Political aims have played a large
part in bringing about this result, and it is therefore not surprising
that French investigators, who are almost without exception officers
in active service or pensioned, have accomplished most. The work
of the Vicomte de Foucauld and, it seems, that of the Marquis de
Segonzac—for his book has not yet appeared—belong to the highest
achievements in the field of research on African soil. Much that is
valuable, notably chartographic material, collected by French officers,
especially of the mission militaire, on their travels through the coun-
try is probably lying unused in the maps of the French ministry of
war. Other names worthy of mention are those of the Englishmen,
Hooker, Maw, Ball, Harris, and of the Germans, Von Fritsch and
Rein. I myself have devoted special attention to Moroceo for many
years, and in 1888, 1899, and 1901, I traveled through the country for
purposes of investigation.

No presentation at all satisfactory from a scientific standpoint is
in existence. The best map is that of R. de Flotte Roquevaire, on a

seale of 1: 1,000,000, for which he had a reliable basis to work upon
in the map of P. Schnell, on a scale of 1: 1,750,000, and also in the
book by Schnell, which gives evidence of remarkable industry and
insight.

On the southeast the boundaries of Morocco are quite indefinite;
therefore its exact size can not be determined. On a rough estimate
IT ascribe to this group of countries a surface measure of 600,000 km?.
Of course I exclude Tuat and include Tafilalet, the whole district of
the Draa, the province of Tekna, and all the country southward to
the Sakiet-el-Hamra. For, as a matter of fact, the sultan at this
day exerts a certain influence as far south as Cape Juby, since he
bought the English trading colony there for a great deal of money,
garrisoned it with about sixty men, and by means of yearly gifts pre-
railed on the real sovereign of the land, the Sheik El Maleynin, to
place himself, to all external appearances, under the overlordship of
the sultan.

So far as population is concerned, I will content myself with the
statement that it amounts to about 8,000,000.

Thus Morocco is important, if only from its size and population;
and its significance is increased by its situation and by its posi-
tion relative to other countries, as well as by its extraordinary
internal resources. Morocco is by far the most important of the
three Atlas countries. Its situation enables it to maintain relations
with the Mediterranean as well as with the ocean, and to share in
the domination of the Strait of Gibraltar, the most important strait
to the entire trading world. Its towns on the ocean, whose harbors
could be made excellent without great cost, might be turned into sta-
tions for the world’s commerce to West Africa, as well as to South
and Central America, and even for the Mediterranean traffic. The
relation of Larash to the Strait of Gibraltar is just as favorable as
that of Cadiz. At the other extreme of Morocco, oases and springs
make possible a communication with Nigeria through the great desert
so active that until the most recent times, when the French tied up
the routes, products of the Sudan were carried in great quantities to
and through Morocco. Negroes formed a large percentage of its pop-
ulation, and Timbuctoo for a century acknowledged the authority of
the Sultan. As late as 1887 the inhabitants of Timbuctoo declared
to Naval Lieutenant Caron that they were a dependency of Morocco,
though they said so, it is true, to ward off the French. The advan-
tages of Morocco’s climate, soil, and mineral products can not easily
be overestimated. The provinces along the ocean coast, on account of
their black soil, rank among the richest agricultural districts on the
earth.

nally and longitudinally, of the conditions which here created a
group of lands bound together by a certain kind of union, loose as
it is. At the same time, there is no doubt that here we have a piece
of the great Eurasian mountain system. One group of its ranges
the Atlas Mountains of Moroceo—extending to the southwest, ends
abruptly at Cape Gir; the other—the Rif Mountains—continuing the
Algerian Tell Atlas and bending to the north, also ends abruptly
at the Mediterranean. The Rif Mountains are of a very recent
origin, and, like the Tell Atlas of Algeria, essentially of the
Eocene and Miocene periods. In fact, to judge from the Andalusian
system, the folds continued to be thrown up as late as the Pliocene
period, and presumably their composition is mainly Jurassic and
Cretaceous, but toward the sea of older strata. The several parallel
chains of the Rif Mountains, whose peaks are more than 2,000 m.
high, present their precipitous sides to the Mediterranean, and with
their narrow valley passes they thus form a secluded mountain region,
difficult of access, which at all times enabled its Berber inhabitants
to keep their necks clear of a foreign yoke. Marquis de Segonzac
was the very first explorer who was able to cross it, and his work will
soon give a better idea of it than is now possible.

The Rif coast, with its small coves, usually semicircular in shape,
its small, rocky islands, and its secret nooks and crannies, by virtue
of its proximity to the greatest strait in the world’s commerce has,
up to the present, been a coast for fostering the exploits of pirates, in
defiance of the Spanish presidios. These strongholds, a remnant. of
better times to which the Spaniards still cling, lie in part on island
rocks close to the coast (Pefion de Velez de la Gomera, Pehon de
Alhucemas, Las Zafarinas), or on rocky promontories forming natural
strongholds (Ceuta and Melilla). The natives keep the Spanish
garrisons behind their walls and m their blockhouses in a constant
state of siege, and the garrisons must obtain not only their food sup-
ples from Spain, but even their drinking water.

Inland, toward the Atlas, the boundary of the Rif region is that of
a valley, hydrographically well marked. Beginning with Thasa, of
late so frequently mentioned, and strategetically a very important
place, it extends to the west along the Innaun, an eastern tributary of
the Sebu, the chief river of northern Morocco, and to the east along
the Messun toward the Muluja, then along the winding Muluja itself,
and finally along the Wed-el-Kseb, a western tributary to the Muluja,
nearly to the border city of Udjda. This valley, forming a geologic
demarcation and, as it were, a low pass, at a probable height of less
than 1,000 m., constitutes the watershed between the Mediterranean
and the Atlantic. From of old it has been a trading route of the
utmost importance. It connects the Atlantic slopes of the Atlas
lands, the Maghreb-el-Aksa, the extreme west of the natives, with the

358 MOROCCO.

Mediterranean regions; and it gives Morocco a firm hold upen the
Muluja district, which constitutes a well-defined, distinctive territory
for Morocco, and is a portion of the girdle of plain land beginning -
in Algeria at Oran. It has long been the endeavor of the French to
connect the northern capital of Morocco, Fez, with Tlemsen, and
thereby Morocco itself with Algeria, as with an iron clamp, by means
of a railroad, which would traverse the route along the basin that I
have described. To compare a large with a small thing, this basin is
like the Arlberg pass, by which the Suabian Vorarlberg is connected
with the Tyrol and Austria. West of Fez it broadens out toward the
basin of the lower Sebu. Larash, at the northern extremity, or
Rabat-Sla, at the southern extremity, of this basin, or Mehedyia, at
the mouth of the Sebu itself, would thus be the Atlantic terminal of
the great inland trading route, which is clearly defined by nature
and which ends at the Mediterranean at Tunis. The basin of the
Sebu in its general features resembles strongly that of the lower
Guadelquiver. It is along the above-mentioned valley, now near
Thasa, now near Fez, that the revolts are at present occurring, which
seem to be carried on by the Berber tribes, Hiaina and Rhiata, living
in the mountains on both sides of the depression.

Toward the west, and north of the basin of the Sebu, hes the
district of Andjera, whose chief city is ‘Tangiers, which by virtue of
its position on the Strait of Gibraltar is the exit and entrance gate
to Morocco from Europe. Andjera, the most northerly district, is
filled by the Rif Mountains, which here turn their gently sloping
side toward the ocean. This side of the mountains is composed of
Tertiary strata, which form small plateaus separated from each other
by swiftly flowing streams.

As yet we have little ight upon the geologic history of the
Moroccan Atlas Mountains and -their relations to the Algerian
Sahara Atlas. Of the Sahara Atlas it is known that its trend is
southwest and northeast, that it was elevated mainly in the Eocene
and Miocene periods, that it consists for the most part of three great
groups of folds, the demareation between the groups being orograph-
ically well defined. Some of its folds, which are less pronounced, take
a more southerly direction, so that their mountainous character is, as
a rule, not very distinct, especially since the enormous masses of
detritus could not be carried off by running water after the dry
period had been ushered in. The formation of the Sahara Atlas is
chiefly limestone and sandstone, with here and there marl of the
Jurassic and Cretaceous series; but Devonian and Carboniferous
rocks appear among these, increasing toward the southwest, in the
direction of the Moroccan Atlas, in the district of the Wed Gir and
Susfana. The Morocean Atlas range shows essentially different
features from the Sahara Atlas, though the trend is in the same
MOROCCO. 359

direction. Older eruptive rocks: that is, porphyrite, diorite, and
granite, which seem to be entirely lacking in the Sahara Atlas of
Algeria, are here the most» prominent, as is proved not only by the
mountains themselves but also by the composition of the accumula-
tions of detritus at the mouths of the valleys. This recalls the
ancient denuded mountain ranges of the Iberian table-land. The
crumplings in the Moroccan Atlas seem to have begun and ended
sooner than in the other Atlas ranges; that is, at the end of the
Cretaceous period.

According to J. Thomson, the same Cretaceous strata that he flat
and undisturbed in the Vorland are abruptly uplifted and form an
essential feature of the Moroccan Atlas. Then these mountains would
be older than the Rif Mountains, the Tell Atlas, and Sahara Atlas
of Algeria. Paleozoic rocks are probably another large element in
their structure. The process of upheaval was: by far more intense,
so that even to-day much higher ridges (3,000 to 4,000 m.) and peaks
(4,000 to 5,000 m.) appear here than in the more recently formed
‘anges. The breadth of the range (about 200 km.), comprising a
number of separate folds which constitute three parallel belts. the
Great Atlas, the Anti-Atlas, and the Middle Atlas, is also much
greater. The height of the ridges is evervwhere considerable. Deep
indentations do not occur in them. South of Marrakesh (the city of
Morocco), lie three passes, the first 3,000 to 4,000 m. high, the second
lying to the northeast of the first, 2,500 m.,the third, to the southwest
in the direction of the ocean, 1,000 to 2,000 m. The range thus forms
a high wall, difficult to cross, about 1,000 km. long, separating the
desert from the Vorland. ‘Thus the Moroccan Atlas forms a moun-
tainous region nearly as great in extent as the Alpine country be-
tween Nice and Vienna. Though in general, and not only on the
side toward the Sahara, the whole range shows signs of comparative
drought, which accords with its latitude and its situation in a dry
zone. It receives so much snow during the winter that its peaks, cov-
ered with snow until late in the summer, which glisten down upon
the dry, sun-scorched plain, and the streams in spring and early sum-
mer, fed by the melting snows, provide a quantity of water for irri-
gation.

The prevailing drought, increased by an almost complete destruc-
tion of the woods, the cold, and the covering of snow in winter, the
rarity of wide valley plains, which, moreover, where they exist, are
capable of culture only with the aid of artificial irrigation in sum-
mer—all these factors make the Moroccan Atlas less suited to habi-
tation than one would expect. The population is limited to the chief
‘valleys and thus only up to a slight elevation. Proper conditions are
also lacking for cattle raising and mountain grazing. The region
offers no allurements to the conqueror. Consequently, the Berber

Mountain folk, whose subjection was difficult, have always maintained
their independence. It was scarcely possible for the masters of the
Vorland countries to secure routes of communication for themselves
with the other side of the mountains. They preferred to lock the
passes by placing castles at their openings. It is a custom obtaining
among the Berbers from the southern part of Tunis, south of Syrtis
Minor, as far as the ocean, to stow. their provisions and valuable
possessions in castles, in Morocco called Tirremt, built upon safe
heights by a village community or by a clan. This custom in some
districts prevails to a striking extent. Moreover, the Berbers place
their villages, as a rule, on precipitous heights. Asa result the range,
with its numerous strongholds and ruins of strongholds here and
there, presents a remarkable aspect.

As J. Thomson has pointed out, the Great Atlas, strictly speaking,
does not extend to the ocean, but only as far as the defile Asif Ig,
some 50 kilometers from the coast. West of this point is table-land,
including the provinces Mtuga and Haha. To the south, between
the Great Atlas and the Anti-Atlas, hes a territory, broadening out
to the ocean, called by the name of the Sus, the long Audinal river of
the Atlas, by which it is watered. It is one of the most distinctive, by
nature one of the most well-defined, districts in Morocco, and at the
same time one of the richest in natural resources. Rich in mineral!
products, well watered, and fertile of soil. the land of Sus, which
even at present has the largest share in the trade of Mogador, might,
under a good administration, become a rich, cultivated district. The
oasis city of Tarudant might become a focus of trade with the South,
and Agadir, which has the best harbor on the ocean—closed now to
foreign trade—might become a prosperous port.

The triangle made by the divergence of the Rif Mountains and the
Moroccan Atlas forms the largest and most important province of
Morocco. At all times this country, lying between the Atlas and the
ocean, has been the heart of the group of lands constituting Morocco,
the core of the body politic. I obtained an insight into its geologic
history on my two last trips. The development of the present sur-
face features is somewhat as follows: Probably toward the end of
the Paleozoic period a precipitous mountain range was thrown up,
formed mainly of Paleozoic schist, graywacke, quartzite, and argil-
laceous sandstone, interspersed with granite, porphyrite, and similar
old eruptive rocks. Where the trend of the folds is still to be dis-
tinguished, it is approximately parallel with that of the Moroccan
Atlas. The almost perpendicular strata of schist form here and
there nearly horizontal plains, as though shaved off by a razor, but
above these the more solid strata of graywacke, quartzite, and occa-
sionally limestone, stand up in projecting ridges.

The Djebilet, a bare, rocky mountain range 100 km. long, which
MOROCCO. 361

limits the northern horizon of Marrakesh; the Dj. Achdar, the Dj.
Karra, and similar smatl mountain ranges, present phenomena recall-
ing those of the Taunits in-Germany or the Sierra de Aleudiad, and
other mountains of the Spanish table-land. The similarity between
these primitive mountains of Spain and those of Morocco is in general
very great, especially in so far as the older formations were overlaid
by more recent deposits, consisting of strata entirely horizontal and
still undisturbed, but merely elevated. The older formations show
through the recent deposits only where rocks capable of more resist-
ance jutted up, or where the recent formations vielded either to the
energetic erosion and denudation produced by running water in the
pluvial period, or to aerial denudation, which is almost the only force
active since the pluvial period. It is to this force—aerial denuda-
tion—that the formation of table mountains is to be attributed.
These occur frequently in the central belt of plain land and often stand
together in groups. The thickness of the overlying deposits is not
very great. So far as I could tell, it probably nowhere exceeds 100
meters. Concerning the chronology of its formation, sufficient paleon-
tologic evidences are still lacking. On my last trip I brought fossils
from Schedma—that is, from the extreme southwest—where disturb-
ances connected with the upheaval of the Atlas are still important
factors. E. Ficheur, who probably possesses the greatest knowledge
of the geologic construction of Algeria, ascribed these fossils to the
Cretaceous period. Going upon this assumption, Tam of the opinion
that the winding valley of the Tensift, which I followed in 1899 almost
from its mouth to the sub-Atlantic high plateau at Marrakesh, was
cut into this rock. According to A. Brives, state geologist in Algeria,
and the first geologist to explore a portion of the Atlas Vorland, in
the winter of 1901-2, the overlying mountains between the Tensift
and the Um-er-Rbia, and north of this region, are to be ascribed for
the most part to the Miocene period. The investigations of this geol-
ogist in Morocco are known only through a preliminary publication.

Accordingly, the Atlas Vorland for the most part has the character
of stratified table-land. The dominating feature is that of plains—in
fact, high plateaus. As far as our present knowledge goes, it may
be assumed that two periods of uplift oecurred, the one in Eocene
and the other in Quaternary time. Consequently there are two
levels—the coast plains and the high inland plateau—which comprise
the greatest portion of the Voriand. The coast plain, whose geologic
conditions I was able to distinguish clearly in my last trip (1901),
begins at Cape Hadid, 20 kilometers north of Mogador, in a narrow
point. At the foot of Dj. Achdar, which is the dominating landmark
of central Morocco—that is, at Sidi Rehal—where the much-traveled
‘aravan route from Mazagan to Marrakesh, in the valley of Mtal,
climbs up to the higher level, the coast plain reaches its greatest

362 MOROCCO.

breadth of 80 kilometers. Northward, at the Um-er-Rbia, it narrows
down to 70 kilometers; in Shawia, to 60 kilometers. Finally it dis-
appears almost completely at Rabat, but in the valley of the lower
Sebu it broadens out again to 70 kilometers, and here extends as far
inland as the gorge of Sidi Kassem, in which the Rdem plunges down
from the upper level. North of the Sebu valley the coast plain nar-
rows down rapidly, but probably continues without break as far as
the strait at Tangiers. At Arzila I found it still well defined, though
with a breadth of only 10 kilometers, extending along the base of the
Rif Mountains.

Thus the lower plain stretches along the ocean for a distance of
650 kilometers, but for the most part it rises straight up from the
ocean, in the south to a height of 100 meters. Therefore the ocean
coast of Morocco is to be regarded chiefly as one without prominent
features, the rocky character of which is due to the close proximity of
the older formations. The earthquakes that have repeatedly shaken
the coast cities give ground for the supposition that there was a fault
here. The coast line is therefore almost entirely unbroken, it being
an exception when shelter for vessels is afforded by a shallow bay,
such as at Mazagan, or by a small island produced by erosion, like
Mogador, or where the breakers and the tides have cut out a bay from
the valley of a small river or from a system of softer strata, as at
Saffi and Casa Blanea. Real harbors are found only at the mouths
of rivers, as at Azemur, situated at the mouth of the Um-er-Rbia;
Rabat, at the mouth of the Bu Regreg@; Mehediya, at the mouth of
the Sebu, and Larash, at the mouth of the Lukkos. Unfortunately
all these river mouths are practically closed by sand bars, due to the
constant shifting of sands during nearly the entire year along the
whole coast. As a rule only small vessels can cross the bars, and
even these but rarely, when the sand is temporarily swept away by
high tides. At these ports, as at all Moroccan ports, steamers must
lie at anchor in the open roadstead and keep up their supply of steam,
so as to be ready at a moment’s notice to reach deep water. Besides,
Azemur and Mehediya, situated at the mouths of the greatest rivers,
both navigable for some distance, are closed to foreign trade, and are
therefore of no significance whatsoever. In places, also, where more
recent deposits have created a strip of plain and bays—that is, flat
coast lands—as in front of the valley of the Sebu and in Dukkala,
south of Mazagan, geographical conditions more favorable to trade
have not arisen. Nevertheless it would seem as though the bay of
Walidiya, north of Cape Kantin, a prominent landmark, might be
turned into an excellent harbor.

An average height of 150 meters might be ascribed to the steep
cliff with which the coast plain breaks off at the sea. Going inward
from this edge the plain imperceptibly rises to a height of 250 meters

MOROCCO. 363

at the base of the higher plain, which in turn presents an abrupt
elevation of 100 meters. Possibly the edge of the higher plain was
once the shore of the -ocean. The coast plain bears nearly every-
where the marks of a true plateau, and when one gets a bird’s-eye
view it appears to be level as a table. Here and there occur hills and
undulations in the ground. Their infrequency is to be attributed to
denudation and to the chalk crust so characteristic of expanses of
jand in Morocco and so fraught with danger, to be explained as
essentially a climatic phenomenon. The primitive mountain crops
out only in Shawia, where :t forms isolated cliffs.

Apart from the large rivers rising in the interior, running water
is utterly lacking in the coast plain. Most of the smaller streams
and brooks that descend from the upper level soon dry out, but their
valleys form an easy ascent to the higher table-land. The only
strips of land intersected by running water are the precipitous coast
land to a distance of 10 to 20 kilometers from the ocean and a narrow
girdle on each side of the Um-er-Rbia.

As a consequence, springs are very rare in the lower plain, and
they probably occur only in Shawai, where they are occasioned by
the impervious folds of the primitive mountains now degraded, and in
the belt along the Um-er-Rbia. For the most part in the countries
immediately along the ocean the inhabitants are dependent upon
artificial means of obtaining water, except where the great rivers
from the Atlas provide good though usually muddy drinking water.
The first expedient adopted by the natives was the construction of
artificial ponds for collecting rain water, suggested by the natural
pools formed on the chalk crust or in shallow basins. Such are
to be found in great number throughout the district, notably in
Dukkala, where there are many hundred, circular in shape, sur-
rounded with low walls, and not seldom with a mound in the center.
Some persons maintain that they are of volcanic origin, but they are
undoubtedly products of human labor. I saw some that had just
been made. Then, the people constructed cisterns on the edge of the
chalk crust, which prevented the water from penetrating into the
eround. Where these means failed to secure water for the eight or
nine months of the dry season, wells are bored, but it is a very difficult
task, as they must be dug to a great depth—-I suppose as far as the
impervious primitive mountain folds. Moreover, for the most part,
stone for the construction of walls is lacking. I measured wells 60
meters deep. The water in them is warm and very often so saline
that at first even animals did not want to drink it, and tea pre-
pared with it is unpalatable. And yet sometimes a well of this
kind is the only source for obtaining water in an entire district. In
such cases they are always placed within the kasba (citadel) of the
kadi, as a means of keeping the population in subjection. A draft
364 MOROCCO.

animal—a camel, horse, or mule—is employed all day long in pump-
ing water to the surface through a large conduit. Not infrequently
women are to be seen harnessed at the work. Here wind motors
would be entirely suitable and they would never lack motive power.

The fact that these districts along the coast at present maintain a
fixed population and are habitable to a high degree is the result of
cultivation, of long, toilsome labor on the part of man. It is also
the result of the remarkable fertility of the soil, which likewise
accounts for the form of the plain. This lower plain land of the
Atlas Vorland possesses a covering of black soil, or Tirs, as it is
there called, which is spread over a large extent of territory. In
1899 I was in a position merely to indicate its existence, but in 1901
1 could carry my investigations farther and verify my previous
observations. I submitted specimens of the soil, obtained on both
trips, to most competent specialists for chemical and mineralogical
analysis; and those analyses not only declared the soil to be unusually
fertile, but they also confirmed my theory as to its origin, which is that
it consists essentially of dust deposits from the interior. The black
soil is for the most part of slight depth and is spread unevenly; the
broadest areas covered by it unbrokenly probably occur in Abda.
Nevertheless, Dukkala is generally considered the most fertile of the
coast provinces. I myself observed black soil in the upper plain lands
of Shawia, but near the edge, and in the region of the upper Wed
Rdem in El Gharb, and through inquiries I established the fact that
of its presence in Tedla, the most inland valley of the Atlas Vorland,
the Moroccan Ferghana, as I might call it.

This belt of black soil is therefore principally characteristic of
the coast plain, where the dust carried down from the inland plains
is retained because of a more abundant rainfall in winter, a more
luxuriant vegetation, and the flatness of the land, which precludes
washing away by swift-running streams. Consequently black soil
is entirely lacking along the Um-er-Rbia and in the strips of land
along the coast that are cut up by rivers. The remarkable capacity of
this soil for water, which has been demonstrated by analysis, enables
it to retain the winter moisture, and this moisture is supplemented
to a certain degree by the abundant fall of dew peculiar to this
coast region. Good results are thus obtained, both from a winter
sowing and a spring sowing of maize or other grain. The peasants
think that rain is even harmful to maize, for it seems to thrive on
the natural moisture of the ground in winter and with the dew.
About the first of April, when the winter rains are over, a variety
is sowed that requires only three months for attaining its maturity,
and may therefore be harvested at the end of June.

The lower plain land of the Atlas Vorland is thus the granary of
Morocco, and the provinces included in it, Abda, Dukkala, Shawia,
MOROCCO. 365

and Gharb, are the richest and most densely populated of that
country. Standing on the higher plain, the traveler views with as-
tonishment the level stretches of Abda spread out at his feet as far
us the eye can reach. He sees waving fields of wheat, barley, garden
beans, chickpea, maize, canary seed, coriander, lentils, pease, and the
like. Tere and there are blue carpets of blooming flax, an innova-
tion introduced by Europeans within recent years. The whole is
strewn with white kubbas, glistening at a distance, and numerous
little duars built of tabia; but not a tree, not a shrub. Forests are
a product foreign to black soil. It is rare that even miserable
looking fig trees or date palms are planted here and there.

By far the larger portion of the Atlas Vorland belongs to the upper
tableland, which gradually rises from a height of 400 m. to a height
of 600 to 700 mm. at the base of the Atlas Mountains that dominate
the whole horizon. Here, too, the prevailing geographical feature is
that of the plain, but not to the same extent as on the lower level. All
the uphfts of the primitive degraded mountain forming small moun-
tain ranges, like the Djebilet or the Dj. Achdar, the table mountains,
tone down the monotony of the form. Moreover, the streams crossing
the entire Atlas Vorland, especially the Tensift and the Um-er-Rbia,
with their considerable fall and their strong current, frequently form-
ing rapids, have cut deep, winding, often canyon-like valleys into the
highland. These valleys are not only themselves impassable, being
accessible as watering places only at certain points, but they also con-
stitute serious obstacles in the way of travel. In the midst of magnifi-
cent savage scenery on a peninsula formed by a bend in the Um-er-
Rbia, like the Marienburg on the Moselle, stands the mighty castle
Bu-el-Awan, on the boundary of the two tablelands, the land of habi-
tations and culture and the land of steppes. The castle has not, at
the time of my visit, ever been reached by a European, which seems
almost fabulous, though the natives assured me it is so.

The whole upper tableland, rather distant as it is from the ocean,
receives only a slight rainfall, and has no black soil. The pervious
soul of the younger strata, as well as the fundamental strata of the
primitive mountains, which lack a coating of decomposed substances,
occasion great dryness. Consequently the country consists of steppes,
which, when the winters have been rainy or where the ground is richer
and moister, are not wholly incapable of being cultivated for barley
and, here and there, for wheat. According to important geographic
features, such as the character of the soil, the presence of water
sources, and the capability of cultivation, this district of steppes may
be divided into two essentially different zones—the zone of real
steppes and the zone of sub-Atlantic irrigated oases. The one, 80 to
100 km. broad, contains, it is true, some small oases, found chiefly in a
belt along the Um-er-Rbia and owing their existence to springs; on

=
366 MOROCCO.

the whole, however, the zone consists of pasture land inhabited by
nomads and seminomads. The number of herds of cattle, sheep, and
camels is fairly considerable, especially because in summer, when the
vegetation of the steppes, like a glorious carpet in late winter and
spring, is scorched by the sun, the herds find nourishment either in
the mountains or in the agricultural districts of the coast plain.

The most inland zone coincides with what I have called, from the
character of the soil, the sub-Atlantie high plateau. This stretches
along the base of the mountains for a distance of 830 km. and main-
tains a breadth of 30 to 40 km. All streams ernerging from the moun-
tains cross it. Mainly infiuenced, perhaps, by the ancient underlying
strata, especially the Djebilet, these streams unite to form the two great
drainage channels, the Tensift and the Um-er-Rbia. The watershed
of the rivers is in the sub-Atlantic plateau itself, but as it is formed
entirely of detritus, it is hardly distinguishable and probably under-
went various essential dislodgments in the pluvial period. The detri-
tus of the Atlas streams, probably accumulated for the most part
in the pluvial period, though the process still continues, forms the
predominant constituent of the soil in the sub-Atlantic zone. In this
regard the zone recalls the valley plain lands of the Po, notably in
Piedmont. All the Atlas streams afford enormous water supphes for
purposes of irrigation, and are used for it even at the present time,
although only a small fraction is accomplished of what might be done.
The water supply is increased by underground sources, which are col-
lected and brought to the surface by the so-called Chattaras, under-
eround drainage canals, similar to the Kanat and the Kariz of Iran,
the Sahrig of Yemen, and the Feggagir of some oases in the Sahara.
Thus, the yellow steppe is dotted with dark oases along the streams and
especially on the lower edge of the high plateau. In the largest oasis
is the capital Marrakesh, a true oasis city, lying in a grove of date
palmns, the fruit of which ripens even at this elevation of 500 m. above
sea level. It is the fruit trees-that lend character to the oases and
make this zone the least treeless of a treeless country. Besides the
date palm there is the olive tree, the fig tree, the pomegranate, the
orange, the lemon, the apricot, the peach, and the almond. Immedi-
ately under the fruit trees and in the vicinity of the groves, where the
soil can be watered only in winter, grain, vegetables, and the like are
cultivated. The zone to a large extent could be turned into an agri-
cultural country, and water power for electric motors is abundant.
Fortunately, the three zones of the Atlas Vorland might complement
ach other: The one produces breadstuffs in plenty, the other cattle,
and the third fruit.

The mountain folk are dependent for their sustenance upon the
Vorland, just as in Algeria the inhabitants of the desert are depend-
ent upon the lands lying between the Tell-Atlas and the Mediterra-
MOROCCO. 8367

nean. Asa result, since permanent residence is offered by the nature
of.the country, small border cities, like Demnat, Sidi Rehal, Amsmis,
and others have grown up at the mouths of the Atlas valleys.

The capital, Marrakesh, which gives its name to the country, is the
chief city of the Tensift region. Although not situated directly on
the Tensift, it has another advantage of being an oasis city in the
open, high plateau. It developed in the first place as a result of its
abundant water supply; in the second, through its position so favora-
ble to trade. As in Milan, similarly situated at the base of the Alps,
the Alpine routes converge like the spokes of a wheel, so the routes
through the Atlas mountains and those to the Sus, and the region of.
the Wed Draa merge together at the city of Morocco, only to diverge
again toward the coast towns Mogador, Safh, Mazagan, Casa Blanca,
and Rabat. Marrakesh, therefore, is the natural capital of all southern
Morocco.

Fez plays the same role for northern Morocco and is the chief city
of the Sebu region. Though only about 300 m. above sea level, if also
hes on the upper plain. The highlands here, nearer to the mountain
and lying between the Atlas and the Rif mountains, are partially
cut up by hilly territory. Fez, as well as Marrakesh, owes its devel-
opment to abundance of water, through which the city 1s adorned
with a border of luxuriant gardens, and to the fact of its being a cen-
ter of trade routes, whose direction is determined by natural condi-
tions. It is the medium of trade between the mountains and the oases
beyond, especially Tafilalet on the one side, the estuary of the Sebu,
and the sea on the other. Indeed, thanks to the above-mentioned
basin lying between the Atlas and the Rif mountains, it is the focus of
trade of the entire Maghreb-el-Aksa with the other Atlas countries.
It is proposed to build a railroad, over 100 kilometers long, to connect
Fez with some point on the Mediterranean coast. From a strategic
point of view it is the key at least to northern Morocco.

The entire Vorland falls into two divisions, according to the
character of the soil, according to natural geographical routes, and,
as a consequence of the latter, according to political conditions. The
inhabitants of the two divisions regard them as entirely different
realms, united only, as it were, in the person of the Sultan. The
northern division, North Morocco, El Gharb, is predominatingly
mountain and hill country, is well watered, and is almost everywhere
capable of cultivation. South Morocco, E] Haus, is for the most part
high plateau, and lacks water, so that it can not be cultivated. By
some Sus, the South, is regarded as a third division of equal rank
with the other two. The border country between the sultanates of
Fez and Marrakesh is one of the regions of which least is known,
becaus2 the Berber tribes inhabiting it, who speak chiefly Tamazirt
even at this day, and include the Zemmur, Zair, Zaian, Beni Meld,
368 MOROCCO.

and Beni Mtir, keep all explorers aloof, without exception, and have
prevented the armies of the Sultan and all conquerors from pene-
trating into their land or, at least, effecting a lodgment there. Even
Roman domination extended only up to this border land. Though
formed by the northern and northwestern projections of the Middle
Atlas, which here thrusts itself forward toward the ocean lke a
wedge, this region, the basin of the Bu Regreg and the Wed Beht, a
tributary of the Sebu, does not consist of high mountains. So far
as I could ascertain, the country rises in natural terraces, with 1so-
lated peaks not much over 1,000 m. high, whose core is formed by
the ancient underlying strata, which in great stretches has been laid
bare by denudation of the overlying strata. It is the steep terraces,
the rugged, rocky Jand, torn by ravines, thick with underbrush, and
in the higher mountains partially covered by mighty cedars of the
primitive forest, that have made it so difficult to penetrate into this
region, while the inhabitants, whom the nature of the country made
half nomad, are in a position, in case of need, to place themselves
in security by withdrawing with their herds inte the higher moun-
tains, to which they betake themselves at any rate in the summer
season.

On account of this impassable region all communication between
North and South Morocco is forced into the one route along the ocean
coast, and even the Sultan at the head of his army when he changes
his seat from the southern capital, Marrakesh, to the northern capital,
Fez, must take the same way. Rabat owes its strategic and commer-
cial importance in greatest measure to this fact. Rabat is the con-
necting link between north and south, a great fortress in the sense
of the term given it by the inhabitants of Morocco. Indeed, it 1s
almost a bit of walled-in country, which, however, is kept nearly
all the time in a latent state of siege by the tribes Zemmur and Zair.
Thus an enemy common to North and South Morocco which besets
Rabat separates the two districts from each other. As a result of
reflection and counsel upon this point, the father of the present Sul-
tan had a fort built through the agency of a former officer of the
Prussian engineer corps, which, with its mighty Krupp guns, domi-
nates the roadstead of Rabat.

Five German meteorological stations have been placed in Morocco;
the two older, in Mogador and Saffi, were constructed by the German
naval observatory, and I erected the two more recent stations, at Casa
Blanea and Marrakesh. The fifth is at Maragon. The best of the
meteorological stations is a sixth one at Lloyd’s signal station on
Cape Spartel. Climatic conditions, which have been investigated
at these stations, may be said to be favorable, not only in the
Atlas Vorland, but in the whole country. Malaria, the pest of the
other Atlas countries, manifests itself here only slightly. Desert

country appears only beyond the Atlas range, and here cultivation
is limited to some few eases and groups of oases, which, like the na-
tive land of the present dynasty, Tafilalet, are watered by the Atlas
streams. On the coast land of this district, as far south as Cape
Juby, the rainfall in winter is so-abundant that there is a wide area of
good pasture land, and barley can be planted in winters of copious
rainfall even outside the river-watered oases. The average rainfall
at Cape Juby may amount to 200mm. As far south as Mogador, and
probably some distance south of that city, the rainfall has attained
400 mm., which, to judge from observations in Tunis, is sufficient for
agriculture; and to judge from my own observations, an additional
advantage for agriculture is provided by the heavy dew that falls all
along the coast and is to be attributed to the action of the trade winds.
which, blowing off shore, carry out to sea the surface water and thus
bring up the cool strata from the depths. At Casa Blanca the rain-
fall amounts to more than 400 mm., at Cape Spartel it reaches nearly
800 mm., at Tangiers it rises above 800 mm. Accordingly the entire
coast land and all of North Morocco are capable of cultivation. In
fact, in the Hinterland of Mogador, in the provinces of Shedma,
Haha, and Mtuga wide areas are covered by open woods of evergreens,
that is, of argan trees. The woods more frequently, it is true, mere
coppices, extend 70 km. inland, where the steppes begin. I have
already pointed out that also in the zone of steppes, where the rainfall
probably remains considerably below 400 mm. at Marnakest (the
average seems to be shehtly more than 200 mm.) agriculture is not
entirely out of the question. At the foot of the Atlas I saw wheat
and barley fields on soil unwatered by rivers, which again gives evi-
dence of increased rainfall.

The population of Morocco has not been the object of sufficient
ethnologic investigation. My observations would lead me to the
opinion that the Berber element is much more widely spread than is
commonly supposed and that, even in the open country and the plains,
it has been able to maintain itself as against the Arabic element
although in many respects it is externally “Arabianized ” and has
adopted the Arabie speech. And yet on the high plateau a day’s
mareh east of Marrakesh I found Berbers that have preserved their
own tongue. In the whole of North Morocco, even in the vicinity of
Tangiers, live pure Berbers, the Amazirghs, and in the southwestern
part of the Atlas Vorland, in Shedma, Haha, and Mtuga, and in the
entire Morocean Atlas, live the Berber Shilha. The Arabic element
is predominatingly nomadic and limited for the most part to the
plains of central Morocco; but the Arabic tribe of Howara, living
among Berbers, has taken up settled habitation also inthe Sus. As
soon as you enter the hilly and mountainous districts you realize that

i

you are in the midst of a Berber population. The city population is
mixed, but chiefly Berber, and the Berbers in Morocco cling to the soil,
industriously devoting themselves to agriculture, truck farming, and
tree growing. Inthe mountains they have introduced artificial irriga-
tion and careful culture of the soil in terraces. Even the pure Berber
tribes of the above-mentioned border land between El Gharb and El
Haus have permanent villages in the mountains, in which they live,
however, only in summer. The completely “Arabianized” Beni
Ahsen in the low valley of the Sebu are also settled in their habits,
even though they live in circular tent villages. Every night they
drive their herds into the corral formed by the tents.

The number of negroes who originally came as slaves from the
Sudan is very great in Morocco, and the farther south you go the
more numerous they become. But this element is probably on the
road to extinction, since increase by immigration is prevented by the
French occupation of the Sudan.

Jews are scattered all over Morocco; individual families and
groups are to be found far in the interior and in the villages of the
Atlas. Like the Polish nobleman of former times, no kadi seems
to be able to get along without his court Jew. They are most
numerous in the cities, especially on the coast, where they enjoy
most protection, and they are wandering there in numbers from the
interior. They play an important role in trade and are also handi-
craftsmen to a large extent.

Morocco is entirely an agricultural and pastoral country. Mining
is unknown to-day; an industry which once flourished in a high de-
gree has fallen into utter decay. It scarcely produces the most indis-
pensable articles of daily use, and gradually more and more dress
material, metal ware, and the like are introduced from Europe. In
consequence of the inconceivable misgovernment the greater part of
the population is impoverished, the spirit of enterprise is deadened,
the desire for gain weakened, the export of grain, cattle, horses, and
other important objects forbidden, and the construction of roads and
bridges unknown. Commerce, therefore, is but sight. Though the
basis for the statement is not official, yet it is a fair estimate to place
the value of the yearly exports and imports at about $13,750,000.
The foreigners chiefly concerned in the exports are the Germans, who
came to Morocco scarcely two decades ago, but in the imports the Ger-
mans yield place to the English and the French. By this time, how-
ever, German trade with Morocco is possibly second only to the
English.

The government is so bad that in times of drought or locust plagues
it can not ward off famine, despite all its restrictions upon export,
and it provokes frequent uprisings, through which whole districts are
systematically laid waste and their inhabitants killed off. In fact one
MOROCCO. Bal

can say with safety at any time that there isa revolt going on somewhere
in Morocco. In consequence of this misgovernment the population is
nowhere dense, not even in the most richly blessed regions. [believe
that the rate of density is not more than 50 heads per square kilometer
in Abda, which is comparatively thickly settled, and in which one
comes upon a duar, though usually a small one, every quarter of an hour.
And I also believe that the estimate which ascribes a population of
8,000,000 probably comes pretty near the truth; but this is certainly
the maximum. Only a portion of this population, however, is bound
together by political ties and yields to the authority of the Sultan. Of
the 600,000 square kilometers that I ascribe to Morocco by far the
larger part belongs to what is in the country itself called Beled-es-
Ssiba, “ the independent territory,” upon which the Sultan at best
exercises influence as the religious head; and only 180,000 square kilo-
meters are comprised in Beled-el-Makhzen, “the land of the chan-
cery,” which includes the provinces acknowledging the authority of
the Sultan. The kernel of the Beled-el-Makhzen is the Atlas Vor-
land, of about 85,000 square kilometers and containing 3,000,000. in-
habitants.

In the hands of a European power which could develop the re-
sources of this country still lingering in medizwvalism and could make
its position count for all it is worth, Morocco might become a political
factor of the first rank—might, indeed, be capable of bringing about
a change in the distribution of power among the European States.
At the same time, the fact must not be disregarded that it would be
a long and difficult task to conquer the country. It would not be so
hard to conquer the Atlas Vorland, which is open country throughout
and easily accessible from the ocean, but. all the more difficult to con-
quer the Atlas Mountain countries and the thickly populated Rif ter-
ritory. But little help would be afforded by the existing division of
the mountain folk into a number of small tribes, which rule them-
selves democratically and are in a state of constant feud and vendetta
with each other, for their love of freedom is ungovernable and the
nature of the ground presents very great obstacles. This is especially
true of the natural route by which France could chain Morocco to
herself, the valley mentioned in the early part of this article, along
which at this very moment war operations are taking place, and which
will not be safe until the mountain folk to the north and the south,
the mighty tribes of Rhiata, Hiaina, and others, will have been com-
pletely conquered.

And it is these very North-Moroccan Berbers that are now armed
with the best European breechloaders, which they obtained through
the smuggling that goes on from Spain and Gibraltar and, perhaps,
recently, from Algeria as well. It would seem as though the European
powers, well aware of the frightful danger to the world’s peace in-
372 MOROCCO.

volved in the discussion of the Moroccan question, wish even now at
any cost to keep intact this State that holds European civilization in
scorn. Perhaps the question for France is only to break the influence
of the English, which has grown very strong at court. It is curious
that, to judge from the expressions of the press, the German Empire
would seem to have no political interests in Morocco, while the fact is
that all trading countries are concerned in the question of the Strait,
and, in so far as economic interests are involved, Germany holds the
second place. These interests would be devoted to destruction, our
position as > world power and a great commercial country would be
endangered in the highest degree, were Morocco in any form what-
ever to fall into the hands of any one power, such as France, for
instance. If sometime a change in the political map of this part of
Africa becomes inevitable, the German Empire must get its share
EK] Haus and Sus. German interests at the Strait are protected, at
need, if two powers hold each other in check there, Spain, it is self-
understood, not being reckoned as a power. At all events, geo-
eraphical conditions are favorable to a political division of Morocco,
which in all times has been a dormant issue.

THE WORK OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE.

By F. H. NEWELL,

Chief Engineer of Reclamation Service, U. S. Geological Survey.

During the year 1904 there has been a notable increase in the
knowledge of the possibilities of development of the West, and a
long step has been taken toward the realization of some of these pos-
sibilities by the beginning of construction of large irrigation works
by the Government. he funds for this purpose are furnished by
proceeds from the disposal of public lands in thirteen States and_ three
Territories, and the operations have been carried on by the reclama-
tion service under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior.

The corps of engineers to which has been intrusted the work of
planning and constructing the great irrigation works has been stead-
ily increased and strengthened by the addition of experienced men
through competitive civil-service examination. At the same time
the energies of the corps as a whole have been directed toward exam-
ining into the possibilities of further work, reporting details of con-
struction, and toward pushing forward the operations with as great
speed and energy as are compatible with economy and thoroughness.
The work has reached the stage where, in the spring of 1905, water
will be put upon several thousand acres of land in Nevada, and many
of the larger structures of national importance will be well underway.

In order to make choice of particular projects, it has been necessary
to pass in review the physical conditions of the entire West and to
consider from a broad standpoint the relative merits of an almost
infinite number of possibilities. In any one State there are to be
found feasible projects, large and small, and the entire reclamation
fund and all of the energies of its engineers could profitably be de-
voted to that State. It is necessary, however, under the general terms
of the law, to do something in each State or Territory and to expend
as far as practicable the major portion of the fund derived from that
State within its boundaries.

a@An abstract of an address before the National Geographic Society, January
12, 1905, revised by the author and brought up to date. This article is in con-
tinuation of a paper printed in the Smithsonian Report for 1903, pp. 827 to S841.

374 THE WORK OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE.

¢ p)

For practical purposes the term “ major portion” of the fund as
used in the law is considered to be 51 per cent. That is to say, if in
the course of time $2,000,000 is derived from the disposal of lands in
North Dakota, at least $1,020,000 should be set aside for projects in
that State, if found feasible, while $980,000 could be utilized else-
where. If the entire fund from all the States and Territories
amounted to $20,000,000, then $10,200,000 may be considered as
fixed or restricted and $9,800,000 can be expended in one or more
of the States according to the discretion of the Secretary of the
Interior.

The problem of picking out the best projects is thus a double one.
First, within each particular State and Territory the best scheme
must be chosen, and second, taking all of the States and Territo-
ries, the best projects, irrespective of State lines, can then be selected
and the minor portion of the fund utilized in their construction.
There is thus offered a wide latitude for judgment and there is
required for correct decision a full and comprehensive knowledge
of the entire West. This knowledge is not confined to physical con-
ditions or engineering details alone, but must take into account the
social or political conditions and the financial problems involved—
that is to say, the character of the people, the transportation possibili-
ties, the kind of crops, and the markets for these, must all be taken
into account, as well as the cost and permanence of the structures.

In order to give the Secretary of the Interior full information and
advice concerning this great range of conditions, the reclamation
service has been organized in such a way as to bring together men
experienced in practical affairs and in engineering details. All mat-
ters of fact which bear upon the larger problems are assembled by
men in the field, arranged and presented in concise form to boards of
engineers convened from time to time to discuss the data and to
arrive at definite conclusions. These engineers occupying consulting
or administrative positions spend their entire time traveling about
from point to point, personally examining all of the conditions, so
that when brought together each man has a large fund of personal
knowledge upon which to draw. This, and the new data presented,
enables the board, with its past experience, to take up decisively a
large range of facts and after discussion and deliberation present
these in the form of a few definite recommendations.

For each project a board is convened consisting of the men who are
most familiar with the essential facts. This board takes into con-
sideration all matters of water supply, character of foundations, and
materials for construction, also the design and operation of each part
of the work; the character of the lands to be supphed, the amount
of alkali in the soil, necessity of drainage, the climatic conditions,
crops to be grown, transportation and market facilities, together

with numerous other details... After goin,: over all of these matters
on the ground the project board puts its recommendations in writ-
ing. These are transmitted to the chief engineer and by him to
the Director of the Geological Survey, and finally to the Secretary of
the Interior. These recommendations generally lead up to construe-
tion. Contracts are prepared after advertisements have been widely
distributed and bids are received after the usual manner.

It must not be supposed that when the work of the reclamation
service was begun by the Government there was an untouched field
for its operations in the arid regions. On the contrary, private and
corporate enterprise had been for years at work in the West and had
considered nearly every opportunity which exists. In fact, one of the
chief arguments for the passage of the reclamation act was that pri-
vate enterprise had practically exhausted the field from the stand-
point of financial returns, and if the West was to be developed and
homes made for a great population it could only be done by the Gov-
ernment taking up the matter, not for direct profit in dollars and
cents, but on a basis of getting back the investment without interest
and without profit. The indirect gain to the whole country would be
far larger than the loss of interest on the investment. In going over the
ground, therefore, it has been found that the speculator has not been
idle. He has filed upon or now claims nearly every natural oppor-
tunity in the way of water rights or of reservoir location. The laws
of the United States are very broad, and practically any man ean file
upon or lay claim to lands available for purposes of power develop-
ment or water storage. It thus becomes possible for the speculator to
tie up and remove from use many of the great natural resources
of the West. For example, a corporation developing electric power
at one point can file upon and secure every other power site for hun-
dreds of miles, and at relatively small expense create a monopoly.
The Government coming into the field later is frequently put in the
position of being compelled to buy back at large cost the valuable
rights which it has recently given away.

The State laws regarding water rights are in many cases very
indefinite and speculators can, by posting notice, lay claim to the
waters of various rivers, although they do not have the financial means
to utilize them, or they may make filings upon reservoir sites or enter
under the various land laws tracts of land which command the situa-
tion. It thus results that reservoirs can not be constructed without
buying out these rights at high prices. In short, the present land
laws and their administration favor monopoly in water, and the Gov-
ernment or the bona fide investor is at great disadvantage in attempt-
ing to develop the country or to create homes for settlers. These
conditions have greatly hampered the work of the reclamation service.

If it were possible to find any considerable number of localities
ao THE WORK OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE.

where the Government could go in with a free hand, take the unutil-
ized waters, build the works without impediment, and divert the
water to public land, the problem would be very simple. On the con-
trary, the reclamation service must first ascertain, often at great ex-
pense and after a long delay, the fact as to whether there is any water
not yet appropriated, and whether it is possible to establish a legal
claim to this water. It must then endeavor to get a clear title to the
sites for its hydraulic works, as most of these commanding positions
have already been seized by speculators. The owners of smal! tracts
scattered here and there through public lands must be organized into
water-users’ associations in order that they may be dealt with on a
business basis. The building of the works is relatively a simple mat-
ter compared to the solution of many of these problems, which require
that the engineers shall be at the same time business men and that
they may have the assistance of shrewd and able lawyers and finan-
clers.

Among the most difficult matters to be determined is the relation
between private enterprise and the operations of the reclamation serv-
ice. It must be borne in mind at all times that practically all of the
irrigation development of the West has been carried on by individ-
uals or associations, and that while most of the easily constructed
works have been built, there are others which are still attractive to
the promoter. In nearly every locality where there are opportunities
of reclaiming public lands on a large scale, it also happens that there
is something which may be made a source of profit to a shrewd
investor.

It may be said, generally speaking, that no large irrigation work
has been financially successful. It has frequently been pointed out
that all irrigation works may be divided into two classes, roughly
designated as large and small. The small works or ditches built by
farmers or associations of settlers have, almost without exception,
been successful in every respect. The large enterprises, where stock
and bonds haye been sold and capital brought in from the East or
from foreign countries, have, almost without exception, proved finan-
cially unprofitable and have had a long and involved history of dis-
appointment and occasional bankruptey. Nevertheless, in spite of
this almost universal experience, there are still optimistic individuals
who plan to avoid all failures of the past and prepare glowing pros-
pectuses of new enterprises which it is alleged, if properly manipu-
lated, will bring large returns to investors. As soon as the Govern-
ment shows an interest in any particular locality some energetic pro-
moter at once concludes that there may be something there which may
be of value to himself. Tf it should be decided that a project must be
stopped as soon as any private interest of this kind is encountered,
the work of the reclamation service would soon come to a halt.
77

sy)

THE WORK OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE.

As before stated, nearly every possibility of reclamation has been
under consideration by somebody at some time, and while every effort
should be made to avoid interference, it is not fair to the communities
concerned nor to the Commonwealth for the reclamation service to
step aside in favor of speculative enterprises, especially when they
would only partly develop the opportunities.

The following paragraphs are quoted from a statement by Hon.
Thomas R. Bard, a Senator from California, and chairman of the
Senate Committee on Irrigation:

It is recognized that the primary purpose of the reclamation act is to utilize
the public domain by means of irrigation and make it available for occupation
by settlers. The right to the use of the water provided by the expenditure of
the reclamation fund must be permanently attached to the land irrigated, and
“beneficial use” is made the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right. In
every case where a considerable part of the irrigable lands are owned by the
Government it is clearly inconsistent with the spirit of the act to permit such
lands to be subject forever to a load of charges for interest and profits to be
paid upon private capital invested in the irrigation works, these charges being
in addition to a high cost of maintenance. This is especially questionable where
the water, instead of being attached to the land as an appurtenant right, is
owned and controlled by nonresident landlords.

The reclamation act applies also to land in private ownership, and it is plain
that the general welfare of the nation requires that the water resources should
be made to subserve the greatest possible good. The declaration of the law that
the right to the use of the water shall be appurtenant to the land and that bene-
ficial use shall limit the right must be undersood as a recognition of the general
principles and policies.

By keeping the obvious intent of the law in mind it will be possible to solve
many of the difficult questions which arise when private irrigation enterprises
interfere with Government projects. It is clearly the duty of the Reclamation
Service to investigate and determine whether a given private enterprise is
competent to utilize the irrigation resources to the fullest extent, and whether
the private works are of a permanent character. It is entirely proper for the
Service to refuse to abandon its own projects until satisfactory guaranties are
given that these requirements will be provided.

In short, the Service may, in the interest of the public, determine what shall
be the character and scope of the work to be undertaken by private enterprise
in this particular locality, and what shall be the burden to be carried by the
irrigated lands, and may properly assert that a compliance with such require-
ments shall be the conditions upon which the Government shall surrender its
right to provide the works and abandon its project.

The reservoir sites and similar essential portions of a comprehensive project
should be withdrawn from speculative entry by the Reclunation Service and
held for the largest practicable irrigation development. In cases where with-
drawals have been made and investigations begun, and where promoters ask
the Reclamation Service to step aside for their own benefit. they should be able
to show, first, that they intend to construct in good faith and are not merely
speculators, and, second, that the project to be constructed will*be of real publie
benefit, will develop the country fully, and will not act as an obstruction to
more comprehensive or economical systems,

.
Biles THE WORK OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE.

The fund created by the act of June 17, 1902, is added to from time
to time by the proceeds from the disposal of public lands. These
proceeds for the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June are as follows:

The fund probably reached its maximum in 1903, and the annual
increments may be expected to be steadily diminished. If, however,
it is assumed that the proceeds for the current fiscal year of 1905 are
$5,000,000, there will be available by June 30, 1905, in round numbers,
a total of $28,000,000.

The following table gives the names of the States and Territories
from which the fund is derived, these being arranged in numerical
order, Oregon, the State from which the largest portion of the fund
has come, being placed first on the list. The last in order is Nevada.
Opposite the name of each State and Territory is given the aggregate
amount derived up to and including June 30, 1904, and also the
restricted portion of the fund, or 51 per cent, this being accepted as the
meaning of that portion of the Reclamation Act which declares it to
be the duty of the Secretary to expend the major portion of the fund
in the State in which it arose.

A glance at this table shows that as a rule the States where irriga-
tion is most needed have furnished the least amount of money. This
might be expected, as these States are arid in character and the lands
are not readily disposed of.

MALHEUR DAM SITE, ON THE MALHEUR RIVER, OREGON.
THE WORK OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE. 319

The list below gives the principal projects in each State which,
from present knowledge, appear to be most desirable for pushing to
completion. Some of these have been definitely approved by the
Secretary of the Interior and others are in various stages preliminary
‘to such approval. ‘The steps leading up to the adoption of a project
are about as follows:

First, a reconnaissance is made which determines in a general way
the desirability of making a definite survey. When this survey is
well advanced or has been completed the project is brought to the
attention of the Secretary for tentative approval, and authority is
obtained for further detailed investigation and for the acquisition of
lands or rights which may be needed. The next step is generally the
completion of detailed drawings and specifications. The whole mat-
ter is then referred by the chief engineer to a project board for care-
ful consideration and report.

The estimated cost per acre of this reclamation ranges from $20 to
$30 and averages about $25.

In addition to the principal projects above sted reconnaissance
surveys are being carried on in each of the 13 States and 3 Territories,
and alternative projects are also being examined with a view to con-
struction if the principal projects are for any reason found to be
impracticable. It is proposed to have these alternative projects care-
fully examined and ready for construction as soon as the principal
projects are out of the way. The following paragraphs give briefly
the present stage of knowledge concerning each of the principal
projects:

Arizona.—The Salt River project contemplates the storage of water
380 THE WORK OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE.

for irrigating approximately 160,000 acres of land and the develop-
ing of pumping facilities for an additional acreage. The cost will
probably be about $20 per acre, and ultimately from $3,000,000 to
$4,000,000 will be expended.

California—The Yuma project on the lower Colorado River as
now outlined involves the reclamation of 85,500 acres at a cost of $35
per acre, the land being on both sides of the river, in California and
Arizona.

Colorado.—The Gunnison project contemplates the reclamation of
100,000 acres of land in the Uncompahgre Valley, at a cost of about
$25 per acre. This land is largely in private ownership. The project
involves the building of a tunnel 6 miles long from Gunnison River.

Idaho.—The Minidoka project is designed to reclaim 130,000 to
130,000 acres of vacant public land on both sides of Snake River, at a
cost of $26 per acre. This is to be accomplished by the construction
of dam and canals and development of the gravity and pumping
systems.

Kansas.—Along Arkansas River it is probable that water can be
pumped from the underlying gravels. Investigations have been made
which indicate that considerable development of private lands may
take place under the terms of the reclamation act.

Montana.—The Milk River project is designed to reclaim nearly
60,000 acres of land, mostly public, and located mainly on the south
side of Milk River, east of Malta, Mont. Water will be stored in
reservoirs. The cost will be from $20 to $25 per acre.

Nebraska—The North Platte project is designed to reclaim an
undetermined area on both sides of North Platte River, in both Wyo-
ming and Nebraska. Water will be stored in Wyoming and canals
built, heading in the State. Most of the land is now in private own-
ership. The cost of reclamation will probably be between $30 and
$35 per acre.

Nevadu.—The Truckee project, now under construction, will re-
claim upward of 150,000 acres, at a cost of about $26 per acre. There
are a number of ramifications which are yet to be worked out, and
these may result in a larger development.

New Mexico.—The Hondo project, in the vicinity of Roswell, will
irrigate about 10,000 acres, a portion of which is in private owner-
ship. The cost will be upward of $25 per acre. Water is to be
obtained from flood storage in a reservoir to be constructed on the
north side of Hondo River.

North Dakota—The Fort Buford project is designed to reclaim
60,000 acres on the west side of Yellowstone River, in Montana and
North Dakota, at a cost of about $30 per acre. Most of this land is
in private ownership.

Oklahoma.—In this Terr'tory reconnaissance has shown that water
THE WORK OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE. 381

may be stored on the north fork of Red River, and it is believed that
further exploration will show that there are lands which can be profit-
ably irrigated by this stored water, at a cost of not to exceed $20 per
acre.

Oregon.—The Malheur project, on both sides of Malheur River,
west of Ontario, will reclaim, by storage of flood waters of Malheur
River, about 90,000 acres, at a cost of about $30 per acre.

South Dakota—The Bellefourche project contemplates the recla-
mation of 60,000 acres of arid land, largely public, situated northerly
from the Black Hills, by the storage of flood waters of Bellefourche
River. The cost will be about $30 per acre.

Utah—The Utah Lake project contemplates the utilization of
waters tributary to Utah Lake and the reduction of evaporation
losses by drawing down the lake. It is possible that 60,000 acres
may be reclaimed, at a cost of $35 per acre.

Washington—The Palouse project is for the redemption of arid
lands near Pasco by storage in Washtucna reservoir. Possibly
100,000 acres, mainly in private ownership, can be reclaimed, at a
cost of $30 per acre.

Viyoming.—The Shoshone project is designed to reclaim 160,000
acres of public land in the Bighorn basin, north of Shoshone River.
Water will be stored and diverted at a cost of $25 per acre.

THE YUMA RECLAMATION PROJECT. ¢
By J. B. Lipeincorr, Supervising Hngineer.

Under the provisions of the Reclamation Act of 1902° all the
public lands along the Colorado River from the Grand Canyon to
the Mexican line were withdrawn, pending a general investigation.
Surveys were at once begun of this district and data are now in the
possession of the Secretary of the Interior relative to all projects
therein. It is estimated that there are between 300,000 and 400,000
acres of irrigable valleys between the points named, immediately
adjacent to the river and exclusive of irrigable lands in interior
valleys removed from the river. There are also 92,000 acres of mesa
lands near Yuma suitable for the production of citrus fruits, that
may be reached by pumping from the valley canal systems.

It has been decided that the proper point of beginning for the
reclamation of this vast area is in the immediate neighborhood of
Yuma. ‘This enterprise does not include or interfere with the irriga-
tion of private lands by individuals and corporations in the vicinity
of Imperial, and there is no apparent reason why there should be any
friction between these irrigation systems and those resulting from the
construction of this Federal work.

During the winter season of 1903-4 the reclamation service made
surveys for the irrigation of the valley lands of the Colorado and
Gila rivers in the immediate vicinity of Yuma, Ariz., and the Yuma
Indian Reservation in California, looking toward the utilization
of the Colorado River for their water supply. These surveys in-
cluded the making of a topographic map, on the scale of 100 feet
to the inch, at the Laguna dam site and soundings for bed rock and
foundations at that point. On the California side of the river, along

nished by the Department for the irrigation of more than 160 acres belonging
to any one individual. whether the Jands are filed upon subsequent to their
withdrawal under the Reclamation Act or are in private ownership under
previous filings. Also, that water so supplied can be furnished only to parties
residing on the lands or in their immediate neighborhood.

the route to be occupied by a possible canal, a map has been made
on the scale of 100 feet to the inch with a small contour interval.
On the Arizona side of the river a map has been made, on the scale
of 100 feet to the inch, from the Laguna dam site to Yuma along
the canal line, and in addition a number of angle-line surveys have
been run for the exact determination of the location for the canal.
Below Yuma transit surveys have been made for the location of the
canal. At the crossing of the Gila River a map has been drawn on
a scale of 100 feet to the inch, and soundings made for bed rock.
Preliminary location surveys have been made for a complete set
of levees from the Laguna dam site to the Mexican line, on both
sides of the Colorado River, and also on each side of the Gila River.
A drainage system has been projected upon the topographic maps
which have been made of the entire district to an elevation of 150
feet above river level, and to the scale of 2 inches to the mile. Sur-
veys have been made preliminary to estimates for pumping plants
for irrigation and draining. A consulting electrical and mechani-
cal engineer has examined the ground and made plans and estimates
therefor.

A board of six consulting engineers has been through the estimates
of the engineers in charge in detail, and the report which is sub-
mitted is the result of the deliberations and best judgment of all
these men, and all estimates and plans have been brought to the
complete satisfaction of each person.

In the Yuma Indian Reservation on the California side of the
river it is estimated that there will be within the levees 16,000 acres,
and on the Arizona side it is estimated there will be 91,000 acres
under the system, making a total of 107,000 acres. Of this area it is
estimated that 5,000 acres next to the Mexican line in Arizona will
be subject to overflow in such a way as to temporarily exclude them
from the irrigable areas, and in addition a small percentage of the
remaining lands are known to be in sand dunes that will be above
the level of the canal lines. In all, it is estimated that on both sides
of the river there will be a total of 56,700 acres of irrigable land, of
which 73,100 acres are in Arizona. The water supply of the Colo-
rado River is adequate for the irrigation of this area.

A number of different designs for the diversion weir have been
estimated upon in the study for the most economical type that may
be built in safety at this point. Several different locations have
also been examined to determine the best place for this structure,
bed rock having been explored for, with diamond-core drilling ma-
chinery, at all possible dam sites between Yuma and Picacho. As
a result of these explorations, the Laguna weir site has been selected
as the most desirable one for the construction of a weir to serve the
lands near Yuma, a high dam and high-line canal being considered

impossible. The type of weir selected is one that has been tried dur-
ing the last fifty years at numerous places in India and Egypt under
similar conditions, three dams having been constructed on the Nile
River within the past fifteen years on practically this same plan, all
having served their purpose efficiently and being in operation to-day.
This type of weir consists of a loose rock structure with a paving of
stones 2 feet in thickness on the downstream slope, the structure
being tied together with three parallel walls of concrete run longi-
tudinally between the granite abutments on the two sides of the
river, and the entire structure being further made secure by an
apron of loose rock pitching 10 feet in thickness and 50 feet in
width at the lower toe of the dam below the sloping pavement. The
height of this weir is to be 10 feet above low water and the slope of
the downstream side is 12 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical, with
the 50-foot apron below. The design calls for the upper core wall
of conerete to rest upon a row of sheet piling driven into the bed of
the river.

The handling of the silt of the Colorado is one of the most difficult
features of this undertaking. It is known that its amount is very
large. The river is on a grade of approximately 1 foot to the mile
above the Laguna weir site, so that this weir, 10 feet high, will make
a settling basin of relatively quiet water approximately 10 miles 11
length above it. At each end of the weir, and constructed in solid
eranite rock, will be a sluiceway 400 feet wide on the Arizona side
and 40 feet wide on the California side with provision for its enlarge-
ment to 200 feet when desired, and excavated to the depth of 2 feet
below low water in the river. These sluiceways will be closed by
large gates operated mechanically. The diversion canals will take
their water above these gates from the sides of the sluiceways.
The area of these sluiceways being so great, the water movement
toward the canal will be slow and most. of the sediment will be
deposited before reaching the canal intake. When this has accumu-
lated to a considerable extent, the sluice gates will be opened, and it
is estimated that their capacity will be approximately 20,000 cubic
feet per second. This great volume of water passing through the
sluiceways when the gates are opened will carry out with it the
sediment deposited above the intake of the canal. The ordinary low-
stage flow of the Colorado River is from 3,000 to 4,000 cubic feet per
second; so the capacity of these sluiceways will be about five times
the low-water flow of the river. These figures are given for pur-
poses of comparison only. As the result of a number of experiments
it has been found that the principal quantity of silt is carried
along near the bottom of the river, and that the surface water is
relatively free from sediment. It is planned, therefore, to take the

SM 1904; 25

water into the canals by a skimming process over a long row of gates,
so that the entire capacity of the canal can be furnished by drawing
but 1 foot in depth of water from the surface of the river. Every por-
tion of this weir and headworks, as designed, would be of rock, con-
crete, or steel, with the exception of the sheet piling, which will be
driven entirely below the water level, and so will not decay. Every
portion of the weir will be what is known as permanent construction.
Such character of work will, of course, be expensive, but it has been
proved to be sound economy to build in this way.

The capacity of these canals at their intakes will be 1,600 cubic
feet per second on the Arizona side, and 200 cubic feet per second
on the California side. The amount of silt that would be daily
delivered into the Arizona Canal, if diversion were made directly
from the stream, would approximate 17,000 cubic yards of wet mud
by volume. It is not believed to be possible for a canal to continu-
ously operate successfully for the irrigation of lands along the val-
leys of the Colorado River unless some very substantial arrangements
are made at the headworks for the handling of silt, and this is
believed to be a justification for the expenditure proposed for these
headworks; also the water must be held to a fixed level at the canal
heading for all stages of the river. This structure will cost approxi-
mately $1,000,000. It is not considered possible to remove all of the
silt from the water, but the canals have been designed so that the
velocities will be sufficient to convey through to the fields the light
material entering the canals from the intake.

Careful study has been made of the existing canals in the vicinity
of Yuma and Imperial to determine the shape that they naturally
assume, and the roughness of the bottom and sides, which tends to
retard the velocity. Based upon these data, the canals have been so
designed as to carry water at a higher velocity throughout than will
be found in the settling basins above their head, and of such velocity
as will permit of a minimum loss by seepage and evaporation. The
gates and drops of these canals and the Yuma bridges are designed
as steel concrete structures. A distribution system has been esti-
mated upon to furnish water to each 160-acre tract. There will be
small areas of land in the upper Gila Valley, and below Yuma, that
will have to be served by pumping plants, lifting the water from
5 to 7 feet. The power for doing this will be furnished from a
water-power plant to be erected above Yuma at a drop in the main
canal. This power plant will also be used in connection with the
drainage system.

One of the most difficult problems in connection with this project
is the crossing of the Gila River. It has been considered necessary
to make this perfectly safe, and for this purpose a structure has been
designed that will cross beneath the bed of the river, the top to be
THE YUMA RECLAMATION PROJECT. 387

several feet below the lowest point of the stream bed. This structure
will be of steel and concrete, some 3,000 feet in length. It will be au
inverted syphon consisting of four concrete pipes 10 feet in diameter
reinforced with steel rods.

Because of the annual rise of the Colorado River, a large portion
of the lands along this stream are subject to annual overflow, which
practically prevents residence thereon, as well as the farming of
them, without protective works. The levee, therefore, is considered
an essential feature of the enterprise. The shape of levee adopted
is one that has been developed by years of experience along the
Mississippi River. It will have a slope of 3 feet horizontal to 1
foot vertical on the water side, and 24 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical
on the land side; it will be $ feet wide on top, and be built 5 feet
above the highest water marks of the year 1903. ‘These levees will
be 4,000 feet apart (one on each side) along the Colorado River,
and 3,200 feet apart along the Gila River.

Because these lands are so flat, and the level of the water in the
ground so near the surface, it is considered necessary, for their
permanent safe irrigation, to supply a drainage system. A main
drainage canal has been designed to run through the central portion
of the areas to be irrigated, and when possible the natural drainage
lines of the country will be utilized, deepening them with a steam
dredger to such depth that they will carry off the water returning
from irrigation or seeping through the levees during the high-water
stage of the river.

When lands in any district tend to become alkaline they may
be connected, by means of local drainage canals, with this main
drain, and in this manner they could be kept free from alkali by
holding down the level of the ground water. During the ereater
portion of the year, when the river is low, this drainage water
would be discharged into the stream, but when the river is in flood
its elevation will be such as to prevent a discharge into it from the
drains. A pumping plant has therefore been designed to lift the
drainage waters over the levees during the flood period of the river
to prevent the lands becoming water-logged.

The whole system, as planned above, is one looking to the per-
manent reclamation of this district by means of irrigation, levee,
and drainage works. All portions of the system to be made of steel,
concrete, or earthwork.

The reports of the Department of Agriculture on the character
of the soils of this valley, as well as past farming experience, indi-
vate that they are exceedingly fertile. The silt of the Colorado
River, all of which can not be removed at the headworks, has high
fertilizing properties. Under these conditions, and with proper
handling of, the system, the valley should be perpetually fertile.
388 THE YUMA RECLAMATION PROJECT.

The entire cost of this enterprise, providing all the.area is irrigated
which is indicated above, will amount, according to the estimate,
to about $35 per acre irrigated. It is entirely possible, however,
that as the construction work proceeds this cost may be somewhat
increased or lessened, although an effort has been made to cover all
contingencies, and the estimates of cost have been liberal. The price
will range near $35 per acre, this to be paid for according to the pro-
visions of the reclamation act and regulations of the Secretary of
the Interior, in ten annual installments after the first delivery of
water. The annual charge for maintenance and supervision of this
system will be very low and probably materially less than $1 per
acre. There will be no charge for interest, profit, or taxes.

In order to keep the price as low as that estimated upon and to
proceed with the construction of the works, it is necessary for all
of the landowners of the portion of the district that is in Arizona,
under the projected canal, to enter into an agreement with the
Secretary of the Interior, through their local water users’ associ-
ation, for the payment for the water when it is delivered to them.
The reclamation service has made the surveys and estimates required
for the Secretary of the Interior concerning the costs and character
of these works; but it is absolutely necessary for the local land-
owners to submit to the Secretary, through their local associations,
the contracts for the acceptance of the water; and also to provide
for the rights of way required for the levee, power plants, trans-
mission lines, ete. This has been done, about 98 per cent of the entire
area under the project now being subject to the reclamation act.

The Secretary of the Interior has set aside $3,000,000 of the recla-
mation fund for the construction of this project, contingent upon
the action of the landowners of this valley and their entering into
contracts with the Department, in accordance with the provision
of the reclamation act passed June 17, 1902.

On March 15, 1905, bids for the construction of the dam were
opened, and responsible bidders offered to build this structure for the
amount estimated upon by the engineers.
THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION.

By Hueco DE VrIks.

The noble aim of university teaching is the lifting up of mankind
to a higher appreciation of the ideas of life and truth. It has to cul-
tivate the most intimate connection between theory and_ practice,
between abstract science and actual life. Throughout the world of
research this connection is felt to be the real stimulus of the work.
the very basis of its existence. American universities and American
science have developed themselves on this leading principle, and it
is especially on this account that high admiration is given them by
their European sisters. Nowhere in this world is the mutual con-
course between practice and science so general as here, and nowhere
is the influence of the universities so widely felt as in this country.
Perfect freedom of thought and investigation, unhampered rights
of professing and defending one’s conviction, even if it should be
wholly contrary to the universal belief, are the high privileges of all
real universities. Wealthy citizens spend their possessions in the
founding of such institutions, convinced that this is the best way of
promoting public welfare. The Government liberally supplies funds
for scientific research whenever its appheation to practical business
is clear. Your system of promoting agriculture by means of experi-
ment stations, of scientifically conducted farm cultures, of inquiries
in all parts of the world, and of collecting, introducing, and trying
all kinds of plants that might become useful crops is not only
admired, but even highly envied by us Europeans.

It is not without hesitation that I have accepted the honorable
invitation to speak before this renowned center of learning. The
ideas to which I have been conducted by my experiments are to a
large degree different from current scientific behef. But I have
trusted to your willingness to listen to new facts and divergent con-
victions, and to your readiness to acknowledge whatever spark of
truth might be found in them. Unbiased by prejudice, the calm
air of the university and the enthusiasm of youth seeking only truth,
and convinced that only pure truth can bring real progress, are the
judges to which I gladly submit my conceptions.

My ideas have grown slowly, and have only reached their definite-
ness and full development under the protection of the high principles

390 THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION.

of university freedom. T have needed nearly twenty years to develop
them and to gather the evidence by means of which I hope to convince
you. I kept my secret until some years ago, and worked only for
myself. In this respect old universities, as ours are in Europe, have
a distinct advantage over your young American institutions. With
you all is sparkling and boiling, with us it is the quietness of solitude,
even in the midst of a busy city. But your students and teachers
are expected to show what they are doing, and to produce their results
at short intervals. In Europe, on the contrary, we are trusted and
left free even on this point. Hardly anybody has ever asked me
what I was doing, and even those who from time to time visited my
garden were content with what I could show them, without telling
my real difficulties and my real hopes.

To my mind this is a high privilege. The solution of the most
intricate problems often does not require vast laboratory equipment,
but it always requires patience and perseverance. Patience and per-
severance in their turn require freedom from all pressure, and espe-
cially from the need of publishing early and often unripe results.
Even now I would prefer to spend this hour in recounting the obli-
gations which the doctrine of evolution is under to such men as
Lamarck and Darwin. I should like to point out how they have
freed inquiry from prejudice and drawn the limits between religion
and science; how they have caused the principle of evolution to be the
ruling idea in the whole dominion of the study of the organic world,
and how this idea has been suggestive and successful, comprehensive
and hopeful during a whole century of continuous research. Every-
where it is recognized to take the leadership. It has been the means
of innumerable discoveries, and whole sciences have been started from
it. Embryology and ontogeny, phylogeny, and the new conceptions
of taxonomy, paleontology of plants and of animals, sociology, his-
tory, and medicine, and even the life history of the earth on which we
live, are in reality in their present form the products of the idea of
evolution.

Instead of telling you of my own work, I should like to sketch the
part which of late the scientists of the United States have taken in
this work. Mainly in two lines a rapid advancement has been
inaugurated in this country. I refer to the pure university studies
and the work of the agricultural stations. Highly valuable is the
application of science to agriculture in the improvement of races.
Each of you knows how this artificial production of races of animals
and plants was one of the great sources of evidence on which Darwin
founded his theory. But at his time the available evidence was only
very scanty when we compare it with the numerous facts and the
improved methods which now are the result of half a century’s
additional work. America and Europe have combined in this line,
THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION. 391

and the vast amount of facts, heaped up by numerous investigators
and numerous well-eqtipped institutions, has produced quite a new
basis for a critical review of Darwin’s theory.

I have tried to combine all these too dispersed facts and to bring
them together, in order to obtain a fuller proof for the main points
of Darwin’s conception. In one subordinate point my results have
been different from those of Darwin, and it is this point which T have
been invited by the kindness of your president to discuss before you.

Darwin’s theory is commonly indicated as the theory of natural
selection. This theory is not the theory of descent. The idea of
descent with modification, which now is the basis of all evolutionary
science, is quite independent of the question how in the single
instances the change of one species into another has actually taken
place. The theory of descent remains unshaken even if our conception
concerning the mode of descent should prove to be in need of revision.

Such a revision seeems now to be unavoidable. In Darwin’s time
little was known concerning the process of variability. It was impos-
sible to make the necessary distinctions. His genius recognized two
contrasting elements—one of them he called sports, since they came
rarely, unexpectedly, and suddenly; the other he designated as indi-
vidual differences, conveying thereby the notion of their presence in
all individuals and at all times, but in variable degrees.

Sports are accidental changes, resulting from unknown causes.
In agricultural and horticultural practice they play a large part, and
whenever they occur in a useful direction they are singled out by
breeders and become the sources of new races and new varieties.
Individual differences are always present, no two persons being
exactly alike. In the same way the shepherd recognizes all his sheep
by distinct marks, and to find two ears in a field of wheat which can
not be distinguished from one another by some peculiarity is a prop-
osition which everybody knows to be impossible. Many highly im-
proved races of forage plants and agricultural crops have been pro-
duced by intelligent breeders simply on the ground of these always
available dissimilarities. They can be selected and accumulated,
augmented and heaped up, until the new race is distinetly preferable
to the original strain.

In ordinary agricultural breeding, however, it is very difficult. to
distinguish sharply between these two principles. Moreover, for
practical purposes, this distinction has no definite use. The practice
of selection is nearly the same in both cases, and, besides hybridizing,
with which we are not now concerned, selection is as yet practically
the only means for the breeder to improve his races. Hence it came
that at Darwin’s time there was no clear distinction between the two
types of variations, at least not to such an extent that a theory of the
origin of species could confidently rely upon it.
392 THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION.

Quetelet’s celebrated law of variability was published only some
years after the appearance of Darwin’s Origin of Species. Variabil-
ity seemed until then to be free from laws, and nearly everything
could be ascribed to it or explained by it. But the renowned Belgian
scientist showed that it obeys laws exactly in the same way as the
remainder of the phenomena of nature. The law which rules it is the
~law of probability, and according to this law the occurrence of varia-
tions, their frequency, and their degree of deviation can be calculated
and predicted with the same certainty as the chance of death, of mur-
ders, of fires, and of all those broad phenomena with which the
science of sociology and the practice of insurance are concerned.

The calculations of probable variations based on this most impor-
tant law did not, however, respond to the demands of evolution.
Specific characters are usually sharply defined against one another.
They are new and separate units more often than different degrees of
the same qualities. Only with such, however, Quetelet’s law is con-
cerned. It explains the degrees, but not the origin, or new peculiari-
ties. Moreover, the degrees of deviation are subject to reversion to
mediocrity, always more or less returning in the progeny to the pre-
vious state. Species, on the contrary, are usually constant and do not
commonly or readily revert into one another. It is assumed that from
time to time specific reversions occur, but they are too rare to be com-
parable with the phenomena which are ruled by the law of probability.

A thorough study of Quetelet’s law would no doubt at once have
revealed the weak point in Darwin’s conception of the process of evo-
lution. But it was published as part of a larger inquiry in the
department of anthropology, and for years and years it has been
prominent in that science, without, however, being applied to the cor-
responding phenomena of the life of animals and of plants. Only of
late has it freed itself from its bounds, transgressed the old narrow
limits, and displayed its prominent and universal importance as one of
the fundamental laws of living nature.

In doing so, however, it has become the starting point for a critical
review of the very basis of Darwin’s conception of the part played by
natural selection. It at once became clear that the phenomena which
are ruled by this law, and which are bound to such narrow limits, can
not be a basis for the explanation of the origin of the species. It rules
quantities and degrees of qualities, but not the qualities themselves.

Species, however, are not in the main distinguished from their
allies by quantities nor by degrees; the very qualities may differ.
The higher animals and plants are not only taller and heavier than
their long-forgotten unicellular forefathers; they surpass them in
large numbers of special characters, which must have been acquired
by their ancestors in the lapse of time. How such characters have
been brought about is the real question with which the theory of
THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION. 393

evolution is concerned. Now, if they can not be explained by the
slow and gradual -accumulation of individual variations, evidently
the second alternative of Darwin’s original proposition remains.
‘This was based on the sports, on those rare and sudden changes which
from time to time are seen to occur among cultivated plants, and
which in these cases give rise to new strains. If such strains can be
proved to offer a better analogy to real systematic species, and if the
sudden changes can be shown to occur in nature as well as they are
known to oecur in the cultivated condition, then in truth Darwinism
can afford to lose the individual variations as a basis. Then there
wil be two vast dominions of variability, sharply limited and
sharply contrasted with one another. One of them will be ruled by
Quetelet’s law of probability and by the unavoidable and continuous
occurrence of reversions, It will reign supreme in the sciences of
anthropology and sociology. Outside of these, the other will become
a new domain of investigation, and will ask to be designated by a new
name. Fortunately, however, a real new designation is not required,
since previous to Darwin’s writings the same questions were largely
discussed and since in these discussions a distinet name for the sud-
den and accidental changes of species into one another was regularly
used. At that time they were called * mutations,” and the phenome-
non of mutability was more or less clearly distinguished from that of
variability in a more limited sense. Especially in France a serious
scientific conflict raged on this point about the middle of the last
century, and its near relation to religious questions secured it a large
interest. Jordan and Godron were the leaders, and numerous dis-
tinguished botanists and zoologists enrolled themselves under their
banners. They cleared part of the way for Darwin and collected a
large amount of valuable evidence. Their facts pleaded for the
sharp and abrupt delimitation of their species, and asked for another
explanation than that which was derived from the ordinary, slow,
and continuous variations.

Their evidence, however, was not complete enough to command the
decision in their behalf. The direct proof of the sudden changes
sould not be offered by them, and they allowed themselves to be
driven to the acceptance of supernatural causes on this account.
Thereby, however, they lost their influence upon the progress of
science, and soon fell into oblivion.

Instead of following this historical line, however, I have now to
point out one of the weightiest objections against the conception of
the origin of species by means of slow and ¢
an objection which has been brought forward against Darwin from
the very beginning, which has never relented, and which often has
threatened to impair the whole theory of descent. It is the Incompat-
ibility of the results concerning the age of life on this earth, as pro-

radual changes. It is
394 THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION.

pounded by physicists and astronomers, with the demand made by the
theory of descent.

The deductions made by Lord Kelvin and others from the central
heat of the earth, from the rate of the production of the calcareous
deposits, from the increase of the amount of salt in the water of the
seas, and from various other sources, indicate an age for the inhab-
itable surface of the earth of some millions of years only. The most
probable estimates he between twenty and forty millions of years.
The evolutionists of the gradual line, however, had supposed many
thousands of millions of years to be the smallest amount that would
account for the whole range of evolution, from the very first begin-
ning until the appearance of mankind.

This large discrepancy has always been a source of doubt and a
weapon in the hands of the opponents of the evolutionary idea, and it
is especially in this country that much good work has been done to
overcome this difficulty. The theory of descent had to be remolded.
On this point conviction has grown in America during the last
decades with increasing rapidity. Cope’s works stand prominent
among all, and much valuable discussion and evidence has been
brought together.

The decision, however, could only be gained by a direct study of the
supposed mutations, but no distinct cases of mutability were at hand
to provide the material. Discussions took the place of inquiry, and
a vast amount of literature has broadly pictured all the possibilities
and all the more or less plausible explanations without being able
to give proof or disproof.

In this most discouraging state of things I concluded that the only
way to get out of the prevailing confusion was to return to the
method of direct experimental inquiry. Slow and gradual changes
were accepted to be invisible or nearly so; mutations, however,
would be clear and sharp, although of rare occurrence. I deter-
mined to start on a search for them, and tried a large number of
species, partly native forms of my own country and partly. from
different sources. Each of them had to be tried as to its constancy,
and large numbers of seedlings had to be produced and compared.
The chance of finding what I wanted was of course very small, and
consequently the number of the experiments had to be increased as
far as possible.

Fortune has been propitious to me. It has brought into my gar-
den a series of mutations of the same kind as those which are known
to occur in horticulture, and moreover it has afforded me an instance
of mutability such as would be supposed to occur in nature. The
sudden changes, which until yet were limited to the experience of the
breeders, proved to be accessible to direct experimental work. They
can not yet in truth be produced artificially, but, on the other hand,
THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION. 395

their occurrence can be predicted in some cases with enough probability
to justify the trial.» Color changes in flowers, double flowers, regular
forms from labiate types, and others have been produced more or
less at will in my garden, and under conditions which allowed of a
close scientific study. The suddenness of the changes and the per-
fection of the display of the new characters from the very beginning
were the most striking results.

These facts, however, only gave an experimental proof of phenom-
ena which were historically known to occur in horticulture. They
threw light upon the way in which cultivated plants usually produce
new forms, but between them and the real origin of species in nature
the old gap evidently remained.

This gap, however, had to be filled out. Darwin’s theory had con-
cluded with an analogy, and this analogy had to be replaced by direct
observation.

Suecess has attended my efforts even on this point. It has brought
into my hands a species which has been taken in the very act of pro-
ducing new forms. This species has now been observed in its wild
locality during eighteen years, and it has steadily continued to repeat
the phenomenon. IT have brought it into my garden, and here, under
my very eyes, the production of new species has been going on, rather
increasing In rate than diminishing. At once it rendered superfluous
all considerations and all more or less fantastical explanations, replac-
ing them by simple fact. It opened the way for further investiga-
tions, giving nearly certainty of a future discovery of analogous proc-
esses. Whether it is the type of the production of species in nature
or only one of a more or less large group of types can not yet be
decided, but this is of no importance in the present state of the sub-
ject. The fact is that it has become possible to see species originate,
and that this origin is sudden and obeys distinct laws.

The species which yielded these important results is an American
plant. It is a native of the United States, and nearly allied to some
of the most common and most beautiful among the wild flowering
plants of this country. It is an evening primrose, and by a strange
but fortunate coincidence bears the name of the great French founder
of the theory of evolution. It is called * Lamarck’s evening primrose,”
and produces crowns of large and bright yellow flowers, which have
even secured it a place among our beloved garden plants.

The most interesting result which the observation and culture of
this plant have brought to light is a fact which is in direct opposition
to the current belief. Ordinarily it is assumed that new species arise
by a series of changes, in which all the individuals of a locality are
equally concerned. The whole group is supposed to be modified in a
distinet direction by the agency of the environmental forces. All
individuals from time to time intercross, and are thereby assumed to
396 THE EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION.

keep equal pace in the line of modification, no single one being
allowed to go distinctly ahead of the others. The whole family
gradually changes, and the consequence would be that the old form
disappears in the same degree as the new makes its appearance.

This easy and plausible conception, however, is plainly contra-
dicted by the new facts. ‘There is neither a gradual modification nor
a common change of all the individuals. On the contrary, the main
group remains wholly unaffected by the production of new species.
After eighteen years it 1s absolutely the same as at the beginning, and
even the same as is found elsewhere in localities where no mutability
has been observed. It neither disappears nor dies out, nor is it ever
diminished or changed in the slightest degree.

Moreover, according to the current conception, a changing species
would commonly be modified into only one other form, or at best
become split into two different types, separated from one another by
flowering at different seasons or by some other evident means of
isolation. My evening primrose, however, produces in the same
locality, and at the same time, from the same group of plants, quite
a number of new forms, diverging from their prototype in different
directions.

Thence we must conclude that new species are produced sideways
by other forms, and that this change only affects the product, and
not the producer. The same original form can in this way give birth
to numerous others, and this single fact at once gives an explanation
of all those cases in which species comprise numbers of subspecies, or
genera large series of nearly allied forms. Numerous other distinct
features of our prevailing classification may find on the same ground
an easy and quite natural explanation.

To my mind, however, the real significance of the new facts is not
to be found in the substitution of a new conception for the now pre-
vailing ideas; it hes in the new ways which it opens for scientific
research. The origin of species is no longer to be considered as
something beyond our experience., It reaches within the limits of
direct observation and experiment. Its only real difficulty is the
rarity of its occurrence; but this, of course, may be overcome by per-
severing research. Mutability is manifestly an exceptional state of
things if compared with the ordinary constancy. But it must occur
in nature here and there, and probably even in our immediate vicinity.
It has only to be sought for, and as soon as this is done on a sufli-
ciently large scale the study of the origin of species will become an
experimental science.

New lines of work and new prospects will then be opened, and the
application of new discoveries and new laws on forage crops and
industrial plants will largely reward the patience and perseverance
required by the present initial scientific studies.
THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES.*

By O. F. Cook.

The theory that species came into existence as results of separate
creative acts has given place to the belief that the diversity of organic
nature has been attained by gradual transformation, but the uncon-
scious influence of the older view remains very strong. ven scien-
tific students of evolution still take it for granted that there should
be species, and hope to solve the problem of evolution by finding
special conditions or agencies which can make new species out of old
ones.

Science is by no means exempt from the very human tendency to
place a fictitious value upon rare and exceptional phenomena, and to
overlook the significance of familiar facts. Between Linneeus and
Darwin a century of careful descriptive study of plants and animals
intervened before the everyday incident of variation was appreciated,
and it came to be perceived that species might arise through progres-
sive change, or evolution. Having once assumed, however, that evo-
lution could explain the origin of species, we have taken to seeking
for evolutionary causes in the out-of-the-way places of biology, for-
getting that the very existence and constitution of species affords
evidence of the most fundamental character regarding the nature of
the evolutionary process.

Why are organisms grouped into species, instead of manifesting
unlimited and indefinite diversity? After reviewing the multiplicity
of organic types and the innumerable modifications possible for each,
it seems superfluous to doubt that the possibilities of diversity are
endless. And yet all higher organisms are associated in species, and
such associations have existed, apparently, throughout the biological
history of the earth. Each investigator in turn has persevered in the
hope that in learning the origin of species he would unravel the secret

tion Not the Origin of Species” (Popular Science Monthly, March, 1904) and

of evolution, but from every mechanical or environmental standpoint
species remain as mysterious as ever.

A species is a species, not through the workings of any hidden cause
of evolution, but because the component individuals breed together,
and thus remain in interconnected, coherent whole. This is the
familiar and obvious fact which has escaped the appreciation of spe-
cialists. The individuals of a species are alike, not because of any
fixed law or mechanism of heredity, but because they are traveling
together along the evolutionary pathway. When a species encounters
an environmental obstacle, and is divided into two groups, the parts
‘an then evolve separately and become different. Evolution is not
shown in the becoming separate, but in the becoming different, and
the process of gradual change would have continued if the original
group had not been subdivided.

The policy of taking species for granted has been carried by some
to the point of declaring that no satisfactory definition of species
could be made, but this was only because they were attempting to
combine two incongruous ideas, and failed to distinguish the species
as the evolutionary unit of interbreeding individuals from the pre-
evolutionary species of analytical classification, ** founded on identity
of form and structure.” In nature, however, there is no identity of
form and structure, and no such species as those into which the nar-
rowly formal systematist subdivides his genera.

It is not possible to make a definition which will enable us to
recognize species without studying them; but, on the other hand, it is
entirely practicable to tell what species are, or how they are consti-
tuted. A species is nothing more nor less than a connected or co-
herent group of interbreeding organisms. Interbreeding may enable
them to maintain a general similarity throughout the specific series,
or there may be sexual and other diversification which subdivides
the species into two or more distinct sexes or castes without inter-
mediates.

Adherence to the notion that species means “ identity of form and
structure” brings hopeless confusion of evolutionary ideas. The
fact that characters which have arisen among inbred domesticated
plants and animals disappear in crosses with the prepotent wild
stock has been taken to prove “the swamping effects of intercross-
ing” in general. The segregation of new variations is now com-
monly held to be essential for their preservation, in complete disre-
gard of the fact that the inbreeding unavoidable in such segregation
would weaken the organism and give it a fatal handicap in the strug-
gle for existence. The original assumption of this theory is as
erroneous as the final deduction. Instead of having, or tending to
have, “identity of form and structure,” it is a physiological advan-
THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES. 399

tage for the members of the species to become more and more diverse,
not in order to subdivide into more numerous species, but because
diversity of descent increases the vigor of the individual organisms
of which the species is composed.

Sexual and other diversification inside the species has continued to
become more and more accentuated in hundreds of independent
groups of plants and animals, and is everywhere recognized as a
mark of greater organic perfection. Professor Weismann held that
under constant external influences variation would not occur; @ but
the practical fact is that in the same species, and under the same
general environments, variations not only occur, but are preserved,
accumulated, and integrated into sexual differences, not by isolating
a part of the species from the rest, but under conditions of free and
continuous interbreeding. The differences between the sexes are
commonly greater than those which separate the species and genera,
or even than those which characterize the families and orders, show-
ing most conclusively that such differences can arise and become
established, even inside the species, and quite without segregation.
But instead of having been appreciated as the most important
agency and the most significant illustration of evolution, sex and
symbasic interbreeding have continued to be regarded as obstacles,
because they interfere with the fancied necessity of segregation.

Evolutionists, too intent on a practical explanation of the diversity
of species, magnified the idea that organisms become adapted to
environment, and disregarded the more fundamental fact that spe-
cies are not by nature stationary, but have an independent motion of
their own. This oversight brought us the impossible task of explain-
ing how external conditions produce evolutionary changes, and
prevented the perception that adaptations are due to external causes
only as environment may influence the direction of the normal and
necessary movement of the species.

That evolution is thus an active, universal, and truly physiological
process is not considered in current theories, largely because thought
and language have continued to follow the bias of the original Dar-
Winian controversy in seeking in evolution an explanation of the
origin of species, and in expecting, conversely, that an explanation of
the origin of species would also explain evolution. Such a history
greatly increases the difficulty of presenting this alternative view, that
the multiplication of species is in no proper sense a result of evolution,
but is due to entirely distinct causes more often antagonistic than
favorable to evolutionary progress.

400 THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES.
EVOLUTION VERSUS TAXONOMY.

The early evolutionists were all systematists deeply impressed by
the vast complexity of organic nature, a sentiment which we may
still indulge, since two centuries of labor have but made a beginning
in the task of describing and assigning names to the millions of groups
of organisms. Nevertheless, it is to be regretted that biological evolu-_
tion was viewed and expounded so exclusively from the standpoint of
the taxonomist. His interests are greatly at variance with those of
the evolutionist, and the confusion of the two distinct lines of investi-
gation has done much to perpetuate the erroneous identification of
the origin of species with the process of evolution.

The evolution best appreciated by the taxonomist is one which pro-
duces species separable by definite and easily definable characters.
He finds such species on islands and in other circumscribed regions,
and infers that isolation is an important evolutionary factor, failing
to perceive that the “ constancy ” of insular species is merely a uni-
formity made possible by the limited area of distribution, and hence
usually absent in species of more extensive range.

The systematist is prone to believe that there has been more evolu-
tion in a genus of ten readily definable species than in another occupy-
ing the same geographical region, but consisting of only one species.
For the evolutionist, however, the segregation of the numerous species
means that the conditions are less uniformly favorable for the sub-
divided genus than for the other. Among fossil organisms, also, the
more generalized the types the wider was the distribution, the separa-
tion of local genera and species following with less favorable circum-
stances or greater competition. Segregation multiples species by
separating groups of organic individuals, just as the ocean might
form many islands from a partially submerged continent. Species
are biological islands, but we do not go further in biology than in
geography by the discovery that islands must be isolated. Isolation
permits evolutionary progress to be made on separate lines, until the
differences become of diagnostic utility to the systematist; but that
isolation is responsible for the changes which bring about the diver-
gence of characters is a deduction no more logical than that the differ-
ences of islands are due to the waters which separate them.

Too narrow zeal in the descriptive task has led many systematists
to act on the assumption that the same amount of difference should
everywhere receive the same taxonomic recognition, a method some-
times defended on the ground that all variations of form or structure
indicate incipient species budding out from the parent stock, and sure
to become separate groups like other now segregated types, a supposi-
tion quite unsupported by evidence. Far more rational and more
secure would be the progress of systematic biology if recognition as
THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES. 401

species were limited to groups of individuals separate in nature,
regard being given to the completeness of segregation rather than to
the amount of difference.

It is to be admitted, of course, that when specimens from a new
locality offer tangible differences from any previously known, the
working systematist must describe and name them as reprsenting
new species. To crowd them into an old species by “ emending the
description,” or by calling them a “ variety,” is to guess at an integra-
tion in advance of knowledge; while to refuse to unite “ species,”
which have been shown to belong to a continuous series in nature, 1s
to prefer technical fiction to biological reality. A coherent group of
interbreeding individuals is the unit of evolutionary biology to which
the term species finds its most proper application. The tendency of
some systematists to refer also to intergrading unsegregated subdivi-
sions of such groups as “ species,” shows how easily conventional
taxonomic methods may obscure evolutionary distinctions.

CRITERIA OF SPECIFIC DISTINCTNESS.

Species differ, of course, in the variability of their characters, but,
other things being equal, the uniformity of the individuals of a
species might be expressed by a ratio between the range and the facil-
ities for interbreeding. A widespread species of sedentary animals
or plants will become locally diversified; more frequent intercom-
munication permits more uniform progress. A single species may
have as great a variety of characters as a dozen related groups which
have been segregated. Two species may be quite distinct and yet
differ much less than the connected extremes of another. That a
species differs in different parts of its range does not necessarily mean
that a subdivision will take place; it means merely that characters
are originating more rapidly than they spread over the whole species.
The integrity of a species is not destroyed by “ inconstancy ” of char-
acters, but because geographical or other barriers make a gap in the
series.

The failure of the extremes of a widely distributed species to breed
when brought together does not prove the attainment of specific dis-
tinctness nor the approach of it, since internal diversity does not
weaken the species, but is an evolutionary advantage, and both ex-
tremes may continue to cross freely with the connecting forms which
constitute the bulk of the species. Neither does the power to form
fertile hybrids prove that two species occupying distinct ranges are
one. Faith in such criteria is simply a remnant of the preevolution-
ary theory of the separate creation of species. The only way to ascer-
tain that two groups of organisms are separate species is to find the

sM 1904——26
402 THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES.

gap between them. Whether they will breed together or not, and
whether the hybrids are fertile and vigorous, or weak, sterile, and
aberrant, may indicate the period and degree of divergence of the
types crossed, but affords absolutely no evidence as to whether the
series to which they belong in nature are continuous or interrupted.
Specific distinctness is a question much more geographical than evo-
lutionary. Evolution continues whether the species is divided or not;
the divergence of the parts is rendered possible by the cessation of the
interbreeding, which would otherwise maintain the coherence and
relative uniformity of the undivided group.

SEGREGATION AND VITAL MOTION.

The systematist “separates ” species because they are “ different,”
but the evolutionary significance of species does not appear from
formal descriptions of these biological islands; it lies in the fact that
isolated groups of organic individuals universally acquire diagnostic
differences. Isoation has furnished millions of these tests of the
universality of biological motion, but it does not cause the motion.
Evolution is independent of isolation, and without it has often
brought about in the same species great diversity of sexes, castes,
dimorphic and alternating generations of many species of plants and
animals. Without evolutionary progress there would have been no
species as we now know them, but the causes of the segregation of
species are not causes of evolution; segregation merely permits this
universal tendency to become more manifest. If it should be found
that evolutionary divergences sometimes assist natural selection or
physical barriers in the work of subdividing species, this would
mean that evolution sometimes results in segregation, not that segre-
gation causes evolution.

Evolution is a process of change in species; it is the journey of
which individual variations are steps. Evolution changes the char-
acters of species, but it does not originate species; it makes species
different when segregation affords the opportunity.

Natural selection may assist geographical and other influences
tending to the division of species, but it is not on that account a cause
of evolution; it represents the determining aspect of the environ-
ment—the factors which influence the direction of the vital motion,
but not those which induce the motion. Natural selection may explain
differences between two species, but not the becoming different. It
is an external incident or influence and not an active principle or
agency of organic evolution. Adaptation is possible because there
is a vital motion which can be deflected, not because the environment
changes the characters of species. The river of evolution flows

. through the land of environment; the conformation of the valley
THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES. 403

determines the course of the stream, but the water descends by its
own gravity.

In the course of its progress the species explores the adjacent ter-
ritory and follows the line of least resistance to the variations it is
able to put forth. Changes are necessary to maintain the vitality of
the species and also to keep it abreast of its environmental oppor-
tunities, and if no adaptive movement can be made it is still unable
to remain stationary, but continues to change in characters indiffer-
ent to the environment, or even actually detrimental.

The species encounters obstacles and subdivides because it is in
motion; the diversity of form arises because variations can no longer
spread freely among the individuals of the species, not because the
environment introduces new characters.

That species occupy definite regions of distribution has been taken
by some to mean that the individuals are similar because they are
molded by similar influences, but that this inference is wrong is
shown both by the wide diversity of conditions under which some
species exist, and by the even wider diversity of form and structure
often found among the members of the same species, in the same en-
vironment. Similarity of conditions may permit plants and animals
of different origins to develop similar variations, and to share,
finally, the same adaptive characters, but identical conditions do not
put an end to individual variations, nor to evolutionary progress.“

THE INFLUENCE OF SELECTION.

In denying that selection has any power to initiate or actuate
developmental changes there is no intention to imply that it has not
profoundly influenced the course of evolution in many groups. In-
deed, it may be claimed that the kinetic theory” afforded the first
concrete explanation of the workings of natural selection. Vital
motion not only makes selective influence possible, but it meets the
ancient and hitherto fatal objection to the doctrine of adaptation,
since it shows how characters may originate and develop to the point
of utility or harmfulness, where adaptive selection can take effect.

That there are species, varieties, mutations, or hybrids which differ
in one, two, or three characters, as commonly asserted in discussions
of Mendel’s laws, is quite unwarranted by facts. The mention of a
single peculiar character may suffice to designate a species or variety
for taxonomic purposes, but in evolutionary studies it is careless to

forget that the diversity is general and multifarious, like that of
individual apple trees or men. Evolution is a continuous summary
or integration of this individual diversity, and is not a simple process,
but highly multiplex, as much so, indeed, as the lines of descent in
which the hfe of the species goes forward. A composite general
direction is maintained by the species because the multitudinous
strands of individual descent are bound together by interbreeding.
The variations take place in particular threads, but evolution signifies
‘rather the progressive change of the whole organic network.

The evolution of a new type means changes in many directions and
of many kinds in the germ cells and in the various tissues and organs,
as well as in the external form of the complex cell colony which we
are accustomed to look upon as a single individual.

Each cell, tissue, organ, and feature is undergoing evolution, and
for normal and permanent progress these manifold developments
must keep together. When single lines or slender strands of descent
are separated from the main network the congruence of type is lost.
The normal variation and individual diversity of the species having
been eliminated, the evolutionary coordination of cells, organs, and
functions breaks down, and abrupt changes or aberrations of heredity
appear. These degenerative mutations may not differ in their essen-
tial nature from normal variations, but the conditions of their appear-
ance are abnormal, and the results often disastrous.*. Mutations, like
hybrids, are sometimes completely sterile, and they may have at the
same time an increased vegetative vigor. The vegetative vigor of
many mutative varieties of domesticated plants has doubtless delayed
the recognition of their abnormal evolutionary status, though the
abnormality of infertile hybrids has long been appreciated. It is
paradoxical, indeed, that the increased vigor which accompanies nor-
mal variations and crosses should also attend degenerative changes,
but there is room for this apparent contradiction in so complex and
many-sided a process as evolution. 2

A domestic variety may be “ improved ” by the further increase of
the one or two characters or qualities which render it valuable, but a
new specific or generic type is the compound or resultant of many
variations in many characters. By close selection, which restricts
evolutionary progress to a narrow line of descent, a “ single charac-
ter” may push out farther in a decade than the natural multiplex
evolution would carry it in a century or a millennium, but such a spe-
cialization weakens and unbalances the organisms, and is a process of
degeneration rather than a constructive evolution. Selective inbreed-
ing and other forms of isolation accentuate single characters, but the

interbreeding of normally diverse individauls (symbasis) weaves
new types out of the variations of many lines of descent.

All organisms are-subject to selective influence in the sense that
variations are rejected with a promptness proportional to their harm-
fulness in the given environment, but generally this leaves a very
wide latitude of possible changes in which selection does not interfere.
The instances are relatively rare in. which existence becomes acutely
dependent upon the development of some one characteristic or quality.
and such narrow selection does not strengthen the type, but insures
and hastens its extinction.

The neglect of this distinction vitiates much evolutionary literature,
both that which treats selection as an actuating “ force” and that
which rejects selection for “ discontinuous variation ” or “* the muta-
tion theory.” It is true that many variations of inbred domesticated
plants and animals are very abruptly discontinuous, and that such
changes are not caused by selection, but these facts in no way mili-
tate against others equally obvious, that the natural evolution of
new types is a relatively slow and gradual process, and that selection
influences the direction of this continuous vital motion. The older
selective hypothesis was only half erroneous. Selection does not set
stationary organisms in motion, but it often guides spontaneous
change. It does not explain evolution or vital motion in general, but
it does explain adaptation, or motion in some particular direction, as
when one species differs from its relatives in special characters which
enable it to exist in a special environment. That all adaptations are
mere coincidences is as improbable as that all characters represent
useful adaptations.

Selection is not, as many “ Darwinians ” have maintained, the true,
efficient, cause of evolution. The vital motion of species proceeds
whether selection is operative or not. Species do not acquire char-
acters from the environment, but merely in accordance with it. At
any point in the evolutionary journey selection may determine
whether certain characters shall be acquired or not. It is an obstacle
in the environmental road over which the species would travel, instead
of being the source of power of the organic automobile. Selection
prevents motion in one direction, but permits advance in another. It
explains why a particular character becomes accentuated in a par-
ticular species, but is no more a cause of the developmental progress
of the species than the turns of the road are the motive power of the
vehicle.

The hypothesis of selection as the active principle or causal agency
of evolution became illogical and useless as soon as the inheritance of
acquired characters was discredited. The first idea without the

a0. F. Cook, 1903, ** Stages of Vital Motion,’ Popular Science Monthly, 63: 16.
406 THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES.

second does not account for adaptations. The “ selection ” of Nagel,
Weismann, and other believers in a “ determining principle” or
“hereditary mechanism ” of evolution is a very weak substitute for
the original Darwinian idea, since it is able to eliminate only the
hopelessly unfit, but is quite without means of influencing the
surVI1VOrs.

Segregation enables species to attain differential characters, and
selection assists their accommodation to environment, but both these
possibilities rest on the more fundamental fact that organic evolution
goes forward without external causation in groups of diverse, inter-
breeding individuals... If a species stood still selection could effect
nothing except its partial extinction. In the recognition of a con-
tinuous and universal evolutionary motion the kinetic theory supplies
the long-sought explanation of selective influence. Selection ceases
to be a mysterious evolutionary cause, but retains a practical and
easily comprehensible evolutionary function.

THE SPECIES A PROTOPLASMIC NETWORK.

The traditional illustration of organic descent by a tree with ever-
dividing branches is entirely misleading as a suggestion of the nature
of evolutionary processes, because individuals do not follow each
other in simple series. Successive generations are connected by end-
less intergraftings of the lines of descent. A species may be treated
systematically or statistically as an aggregation of individuals, and
may be described by an averaging of the characters of these, but from
an evolutionary point of view it does not exist as a species because of
the possession of a certain complex of characters, but because the com-
ponent individuals breed together; through this alone is the integrity
or coherence of the species maintained. For evolutionary purposes
we may think of the same species existing thousands of years hence,
and with any or all of its characters changed.* It is not necessary
even that the individuals of a species remain alike; in many unre-
lated natural groups extremely diverse sexes, castes, and “ forms ”
remain associated in the same species and travel together on the evo-
lutionary journey, sharing the same environment, but without any
tendency to become “ exactly alike.” Moreover, we know that sexual
and other diversities inside the species are not casual or accidental,
but normal and advantageous, facts quite overlooked in static theo-
ries, which have viewed life from a narrowly systematic standpoint

cation of the contemporaneous species of a given horizon is a different question.
THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES. 407

and have argued that interbreeding is a hindrance to evolution in
that it prevents the preservation of new characters.

The kinetic theory, on the contrary, ascribes the fact that organisms
are everywhere bound up into species to a property of fundamental
evolutionary importance, and interprets the multitudinous devices
for maintaining the coherence of groups of interbreeding organic in-
dividuals and the equally general manifestations of sexual and other
diversification inside specific lines, as due to the same requirement of
protoplasmati@ organization, an interlacing network of descent.
Without cross-fertilization species would not cohere, but would split
into numberless independent, diverging lines. This takes place with
organisms long propagated asexually, whether artificially or in na-
ture. For example, the genus Sphagnum, which very rarely produces
spores, offers a multiplicity of varieties nowhere approached among
mosses having normal sexual reproduction; but, notwithstanding so
many differences in minute details, Sphagnum has remained a very
compact, unprogressive group. Cross-fertilization prevents this type
of diversification, but it need not on that account be supposed to
impede evolutionary progress. Evolution is not merely a progressive
diversification ; it requires also a progressive synthesis of characters
by the interbreeding of the individual members of specific groups.

That sexual reproduction is a substitute or improvement of multi-
plication by fission is another partial and misleading view which has
contributed much toward the concealment of the causes of evolution.
The division of cells is the only method of organic increase; conjuga-
tion is not multiplication, but serves as a preliminary stimulant to
the necessary cell division. What is growth, for example, among the
filamentous alge, composed of chains of cells, is reproduction among
the unicellular species where divided cells become separate indi-
viduals. Only among the simplest organisms, if anywhere, is indefi-
nite reproduction possible without the assistance of conjugation.

The new science of cytology has made us aware that the division of
cells is not a passive or a simple process, but is extremely active, com-
plex, and varied. Living protoplasm is in motion, and the discovery
that cell walls are not hermetically closed, but are perforated by
delicate protoplasmic strands, lends strength to the belief of some
biologists that protoplasm circulates, not only inside the individual
cells, but through the entire organism. Conjugation may signify
that such a circulation extends also throughout the species. Or, to
vary the analogy, the net-like structure of protoplasm may be thought
of as continuous, not only in the individual, but as binding together
the whole species by the intercrossing of the lines of individual
descent. As individual organisms will in different degrees endure
408 THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES.

subdivision and are able to restore or regenerate the lost part, so
species may survive a certain amount of segregation; but if too small
a group of individuals be cut off, it perishes through the reproductive
debility long recognized as inherent in inbred or narrowly segregated
organisms. For taxonomy the tree motion of descent was sufficient
as a means of indicating the history and affinities of species and
higher groups, but evolution is a process which must be studied inside
the species, and here the diagram of relationship is not dendritic, but
reticular.

SYMBASIS A CAUSE OF EVOLUTION.

If reproduction by means of cell division is reckoned as an essen-
tial property of protoplasm, equally fundamental importance can
scarcely be denied to the property called symbasis,? which requires
this interweaving of numerous lines of descent and this simultaneous
movement of organisms in specific groups. As organic complexity
increases there is a greater necessity for cross-breeding, as evidenced
by the accentuation of sexual diversity and by the decline of asexual
propagation and of the power of regenerating lost parts. Organ-
isms which have traveled farthest upon the evolutionary journey
are most dependent upon symbasis. Nowhere among the higher
animals, including many thousands of species of arthropods and
vertebrates, is there known to be a long-continued series of nonsexual
individuals.” In comparison with the higher animals, plants are but
loose and unspecialized aggregations of cells, and yet among them
also sexual differentiation has made great progress, and in some
orders contrivances to insure cross-fertilization are highly developed.

The extent to which conjugation exists among the lower groups is
not yet determined. That it may be omitted for many generations
of a simple organism should not be taken to mean that it is entirely
absent or has no importance, since among the higher animals, where

a@Symbasis signifies etymologically a moving together or in company, and
refers to the fact that organisms exist and make normal evolutionary progress
in groups, rather than on simple or narrow lines of succession. The word may
be used also in a physiological sense, to indicate a normal and advantageous
range of interbreeding among the individuals of organic groups. It is to be
distinguished on the one side from wide cross-breeding and on the other from
narrow inbreeding, both of which produce inferior offspring and interfere with
evolutionary progress. ‘Che confusion arising from the very frequent use of
interbreeding in the contrary sense of inbreeding would also compel the intro-
duction of a new and unambiguous term.

b Among the bees fertilization may be omitted for a single male generation,
and among the plant-lice for several wingless generations, but such instances are
admittedly exceptional and specialized.
THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES. 409

cross-fertilization is recognized as indispensable, the growth of the
body to maturity requires millions of cell divisions, each of which
would mean a new generation in a unicellular species. The supposed
absence of sexual reproduction in certain parasitic and saprophytic
groups is a confirmatory exception in view of the obvious degenera-
tion of such organisms.“ .

To the many speculations on the purpose of sex and cross-fertiliza-
tion it can do no harm to add the conjecture that the presence of
moderately diverse qualities of protoplasm facilitates cell division.
Some have held that the function of sex is to assist evolution by
producing variations, and others that it neutralizes variation by
maintaining a stable average. From the kinetic point of view it
appears that symbasis, as represented by the phenomena of sex and
of cross-fertilization, is not an impediment to evolution nor a device
to cause variation, but a means of communicating it. Variations
appear without sex, and may even be accumulated, as by the adding of
one bud variation to another in plants propagated by grafts or by
cuttings, like the breadfruit, apple, and banana. Such progress is,
however, slow and halting, and 1s accompanied by a decline in repro-
ductive fertility. Symbasis not only sustains the vitality of organ-
isms already evolved, but it is directly responsible for the upbuilding
of the complex structure and vital economy of the higher plants and
animals, and it bnilds the faster when by the differentiation of sexes
two sets of variations can be accumulated.

To symbasis is due also the arrangement of organisms in the
coherent groups called “ species,” or what may be termed the specific
constitution of life. Conjugation is the means of symbasis, as divi-
sion is of reproduction. Sexual and other dimorphism, and the
numerous specializations, devices, and instincts by which cross-fer-
tilization is secured, are aids to symbasis, just as the spore-sacs,
ovaries, and placentx facilitate reproduction. The phenomena of
reproduction and those of symbasis are combined, perhaps inextrica-
bly, but all attempts at assigning them to a single cause or property
have failed.

Cross-fertilization is commonly misunderstood to be merely an
accessory of reproduction, and a negative factor in evolution, because
it is supposed to conduce to the permanence of the specific type by
averaging away the new characters which arise as individual varia-
tions. There is the amplest experimental evidence that cross-
breeding is necessary to maintain the quality and efficiency of the

«Under a kinetie theory the existence of sexual reproduction and cross-fertili-
zation in many fungi in which these processes are still unknown may be inferred
from the simple fact that the individuals are grouped into well-defined species.
410 THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES.

individual, but static theories “ have led to the belief that evolutionary
progress requires conditions unfavorable to the individuals of which
species are composed, since under such conditions selection is most
effective and abrupt variations are most striking and numerous. The
alternative kinetic theory holds that cross-fertilization, as the active
agency of symbasis, is a positive and primary factor of evolution,
coordinate with variation itself. Symbasis is the multiplier of the
evolutionary equation; it brings about the distribution and com-
bination of individual variations into the resultant vital motion of
the species. Evolution no longer appears as an abnormal or excep-
tional phenomenon, and it becomes clear that the conditions under
which the species is most prosperous are also those which permit the
most rapid evolutionary progress.

THE PREPOTENCY OF VARIATIONS.

The first corrollary of the law of symbasis is the prepotency of
variations. The combination of variations not only permits the struc-
ture of the organism to be strengthened and rendered more efficient,
but also gives prepotency, due to the opportunity of vital motion.
Variant individuals being thus both vigorous and prepotent, it is easy
to understand why diversity, and not uniformity, is the tendency of
normally extensive species; changes are necessary and welcome, and
the perpetuation of them does not require segregation. Numerous
and well authenticated instances of distinctly prepotent variations

a Statie theories, under which species are held to be normally stationary, may
be subdivided into two groups, those which look upon evolutionary progress as
gradual and as actuated or carried along by natural selection, and those which
treat the motion as discontinuous or saltatory and due, not to selection, but
to abrupt variation or mutation. Selective theories, again, may hold either
that the environment causes the desirable variations or :

“

acquired characters,”
or they may imply the motion of a somewhat constant range of variability in
species, which are thought of as growing out farther on one side because selec-
tion keeps them pared off on the other. Movement is thus aseribed variously to
the direct action of the environment, to selective isolatiou, to abrupt trans-
formation or mutation, or to some combination of these.

Under Haeckel’s biogenetic law evolution appears as @ resultant of (1)
palingenesis, a positive hereditary tendency to repeat the ancestral form, and
(2) kenogenesis, a negative, disturbing, adaptive influence located in the environ-
ment. The late Professor Hyatt summarized a similar view by characterizing
heredity as gentipetal and environment as gentifugal, the one tending to make
all individuals alike, the other causing difference and evolutionary progress.

The kinetic theory depends upon none of these supposed factors, but inter-
prets vital motion as continuous, gradual, and self-caused, or Inherent in the
species, though the environment is thought of as influencing the direction of
organie change. Selective influence is neglected altogether by still other
theories, such as that of Naegeli, in which evolution is explained by an internal
“hereditary mechanism,” supposed to carry the species along in a definite direc-
tion.
THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES. 411

are known, and such were taken by Mivart and other zoologists to
prove that species do not originate by gradual change, but abruptly
or by “ extraordinary births,” a view quite similar to the more recent
theories of mutations," but distinctly more practical, because the
“mutations ” of plants which are the basis of the inferences of Pro-
fessor De Vries are not prepotent but * recessive,” presumably because
they do not represent true genetic variations, but are symptoms of
what may be described as an evolutionary debility, due to inbreeding.
The disappearance of mutative characters when the new variations
are crossed with the parent form or with each other is merely the
recovery, as it were, of the health of the species when the abnormal
condition of inbreeding has been removed, as shown so conclusively
m Darwin’s well-known experiments with pigeons, and confirmed by
an abundance of similar facts. Though differently interpreted,
many other facts supporting this view were collected by Darwin, who
summarized the results of his studies of Ipomea, Digitalis, Origanum,
Viola, Bartonia, Canna, and the common cabbage and pea, as follows:

The most important conclusion at which I have arrived is that the mere act
of crossing by itself does no good. The good depends on the individuals which
are crossed differing slightly in constitution, owing to their progenitors having
been subjected during several generations to slightly different conditions, or to
what we call in our ignorance “ spontaneous variations.” %

Differences between the plants of different habitats mean also dif-
ferent lines of descent and attendant variations, and the beneficial re-
sults of bringing these together may be explained by reference to
symbasis rather than to the “ slightly different conditions.”

While it may not be insisted that species, as described and named
by systematists, are never originated by “extraordinary births ” or
from * mutations,” both suppositions are obviously improbable as gen-
eral explanations. Mutations are seldom fitted to survive because
they are less vigorous and less fertile than the parent type, so that
they must be segregated at once in order to be preserved. And even
prepotent variations have no necessary connection with the origina-
tion of species, since however rapidly the characters of a species
might change, it would still be the same species until a subdivision
had taken place. The more a species evolves the more different from
its relatives it becomes, and the more satisfactory for the purposes of

a Mr. William R. Maxon, of the U. S. National Museum, calls my attention to a
very early announcement of the mutation theory.

“The truth is that species, and perhaps genera also, are forming in organized
beings by gradual deviations of shapes, forms, and organs, taking place in the
lapse of time. There is a tendency to deviations and mutations through plants

systematic study, but this progressive transformation of the “ type ”
varries with it no necessity for subdivision, nor any indication that
evolution is concerned with the origination of species.

SUMMARY.

Evolutionary study and thought have been hindered by the con-
fusion of two unrelated biological phenomena, (1) evolutionary
progress or vital motion, and (2) the origination or multiplication of
species. The “origin” of a species is not more evolutionary than
any other stage in its history. The causes of the subdivision of spe-
cies are not causes of vital motion; the two processes are quite dis-
tinct. The separation of two species is not a focus of the evolutionary
problem; it is a mere incident of developmental history.

Segregation is the principle or active cause of the multiplication
of species, but the nature and causes of evolutionary progress are not
to be ascertained by discovering that species originate by subdivision.
Vital motion is continuous, and is neither actuated nor interrupted
by the segregation which multiphes species.

Natural selection may assist in the segregation of species, but it is
not a factor in evolutionary progress except as it influences the direc-
tion of vital motion. Specific groups become diverse when the com-
ponent individuals no longer share their variations through symbasic
interbreeding; not because new characters are induced by external
influences. Evolutionary divergence may take place under identical
conditions, and in characters which have no relation to the environ-
ment and no value to the organism except to permit the necessary
vital motion.

A stationary heredity or the continued repetition of an identical
structural type exists nowhere in nature; variation is an inherent
evolutionary property. Segregation is not necessary for the preser-
ration of variations; genetic variations are prepotent and are more
rapidly propagated by crossing with the parent form.

A second evolutionary property of organisms is symbasis, which
has built up the complex structure of the higher animals and plants
by combining individuals into the interbreeding groups called species.
The evolutionary species is not a complex of characters or a mere
aggregation of similar plants or animals; it 1s°a protoplasmic net-
work held together by the interbreeding of the component individuals.
Symbasis accelerates vital motion, but hinders the multiplication of
species.

Species and evolution are different aspects of the same fact; evo-
lution goes forward within specific lines as a manifestation of the
same property which necessitates the existence of species; variation
and cross-fertilization are not antagonistic phenomena, but are two
phases of the same creative process.
SOME BIRD LIFE IN BRITISH PAPUA

By R. A. VIVIAN.

What British Papua lacks in big game it contrives to fill with
fowls of the air, which, though varied and numerous, do not exist
in that enormous quantity one would be led to expect of a fertile
country lying only a few hundred miles south of the equator.

No classification of a technical nature, but a brief description of
the different species and their habits, where known, being the object
of this paper, further remarks will be unnecessary in introducing
to the reader the typical birds of Papua, or New Guinea, viz, the
birds of paradise, principally Paradisea raggiana. Our Teutonic
neighbors evidently admire the birds so much that they have given
them the premier position by striking local coinage on the obverse
side with a somewhat exaggerated design of the greater bird of
paradise (P. apoda).

The exquisite plumage of these birds having been already treated
to a presumably microscopic survey, it is scarcely necessary to dwell
further in that respect, but rather on their apparent desire to be
noisy. Their rapidly ascending, shrill “ caw, caw, caw,” repeated,
penetrating the ordinary stillness of the forest, being akin to a
clarion call, while their prancing on a tree limb, which the natives
introduce and imitate in their dances, is very ludicrous. Moulting
seems to take place about August, which is near the end of the dry
(or southwest) season. The noise of the rapids in large rivers and
creeks appears to attract them, as they congregate there chiefly.

The writer is not aware whether it is widely known among orni-
thologists that a blue-plumaged bird of paradise exists in Papua.”
Neither can he recollect meeting anyone who has seen the particular
species in the flesh. The assumption is based on seeing tail feathers
of the Opi tribe. The latter could not be induced to part with the

feathers of a sky-blue tint of a bird of paradise in the headdress of a
chief for an ample consideration. Where and when they had been
obtained the natives knew not, beyond pointing vaguely toward the
mountains far inland. The local name, “ damba,” as for a raggiana,
was also given.

The enormous goura pigeons (Gouwra coronata) are glorious crea-
tures. The noble crests of mottled and slate-colored hues give the
birds an almost commanding appearance. A peculiarity about these
birds is that only in the River Musa district (latitude 9° to 10° south)
are they to be found in considerable numbers. Whether a special
kind of fruit tree only exists in the locality would be interesting to
know, as otherwise that particular part of the mainland scarcely
differs in any respect from other portions of the country east of
longitude 148°. It is well known, of course, that a different variety
of bird inhabits the Fly River districts (@. @albertis).

Pigeons of lesser size, viz, the blue, white, black, and white Torres
Strait, and the white necklaced varieties, mostly inhabit the man-
grove trees on the coast in flocks, and toward sunset can be eaily
shot, flying with alarmed cries in circles above their roosting place
and returning in a few minutes within the zone of the sportsman’s
deadly gun fire. In the islands in the southeastern portion of the
possession the beautiful blue-green bronze pigeon, with white tail
and long neck feathers (* nicobar ”), and a species with a remarkable
fleshy protuberance at the base of the upper mandible, make their
home in the thick scrub.

The varieties of doves are numerous, among which might be men-
tioned a very pretty particolored one with green, white, and yellow
on its body and a patch of magenta above the beak, found on the Con-
flict Group. Also the almost tame green and brown species of the
Lachlan Islands.

At all times of the day and night cassowaries can be heard uttering
their peculiar plaintive cry as they wander through the dense forest.
They are very hard to approach, and only on one occasion was the
writer permitted to see a wild one, and that was through the effect
of a lucky shot by a recruit in the armed constabulary. So far as it
is remembered, the bird was of the common type peculiar to the
country, and stood about 5 feet in height. A one-time planter in
Milne Bay once kept a pair of these birds and trained them to per-
form the duties of watch dogs. As would be expected, black and also
white (Triton) cockatoos (Cacatua ducorpsi) ; red, green, and blue
parrots; rifle birds (Craspedophora magnifica), and scarlet-breasted
green parrakeets are very numerous, and are to be found in flocks
where cocoanut, breadfruit, banana, wild cherry, and plum trees are
in bearing. Plait-billed hornbills (?hytidoceros undulatus), m par-
ticular, devour these fruits greedily, and travel long distances from

their nests to satisfy their wants, making a start from home regularly
at daybreak and returning at sunset. The male usually possesses a
really fine head of golden feathers, which extend from the base of
the bill quite 4 inches down the neck. The hen birds are all black,
with the exception, as with the males, of a few white feathers on the
under part of the wing. Corrugations to the number of 9 have been
seen on the beak. What do these indicate? The rustling noise
these birds make when on the wing is of a weird character, and,
together with the hoarse note they produce, suggests to the imagina-
tive the approach of something ill-omened. They fly in couples, at
an estimated speed of 15 to 20 miles an hour in calm weather.

On a small island in the China Straits our boating party on one
occasion disturbed a huge pelican (Pelicanus conspicillatus) that was
evidently seeking food on the shore. Preparing to shoot it, we were
discomfited by seeing it take a few bounds and with an apparent
effort rise on the wing, and, lazily sweeping in gradually increasing
circles, ascend until it was a mere speck in the sky.

The musical note of the magpie is heard occasionally in Papua.
There is no mistaking its carol. The bird may possibly prove a new
variety. Everywhere obi paradise crows (Lycocorax obiensi) in
moderate numbers split the air with their hoarse cries and plunder
banana plantations, and are especially fond of the paw-paw fruit.

Snipe (Gallinago australis) have been shot on the northeast coast,
where in January they are found when migrating, though from
whence, and whither bound, it is hard to say. Wild duck, too. are
plentiful in the same locality. On the south coast and in the Gulf
district small duck with a broad patch of white on the wing, and a
variety about the size of teal have been obtained.

Vide extract of an expedition up the Morehead River, western divi-
sion, several years ago:

There was a great variety of bird life, among which there were observed the
white ibis and great heron, shags, enormous goshawks (Mrythrotriorchis dori),
wild geese and ducks, most beautiful long-tailed green and scarlet parrakeets,
tiny jeweled kingfishers (Ceyr solitaria), and a little dark chocolate-colored
velvety bird that lived in the reeds (probably Jegalurus alboscapulatus), and
quantities of pigeons, cockatoos, and parrots.

The black-feathered scrub hen, or brush turkey (7. jobiensos), is
tar from being a rowdy bird, and for its modesty in that respect
rarely fills the sportsman’s bag. A sudden splutter of wings and a
dark object flying at a moderate rate toward where the scrub is thick-
est complete the disgust of the man with the gun. One receives some
compensation, however, by being able to raid rather easily the ground
nests of these birds for eggs. ‘The nest, or rather natural incubator,
is usually at the base of a large tree trunk, where the hen lays her

leaves 2 to 5 feet deep and quite 12 feet in diameter. The heat of
this rubbish does the rest, and the young find no difficulty in scram-
bling out into daylight in due course. The egg is of a light pink
color, and is about the size of a domesticated turkey’s. Nests have
been discovered at a height of 2,500 feet above sea level.

On a Government banana plantation, and on large streams, the
writer often perceived hosts of swifts (Collocalia terrefrancica)
appear an hour before sunset, darting rapidly hither and thither, as if
feeding on minute insects of the air. This generally occurred during
the wet season, November to February.

It was from the same point—Cape Nelson—that a coming “blow ”
from the southward was always heralded some hours before by the
appearance of a few frigate birds (/regata aquila), which hovered
in the locality while the wind lasted, and as like mysteriously dis-

appeared. It would be more
appropriate to call them
“ prophet birds.” During a
gale they meet the fierce
gusts with seeming equanim-
ity, neither wing moving;
but with bodies rigid and
heads to windward they re-
main almost stationary, ex-
cept occasionally a shghtly
wo «<—«e — perceptible swaying and mo-
memtarily opening and clos-
ing of the tail feathers—a
steadying agency probably,
besides an aid of ascent—of
which a few remarks will be
added later. Then with a lightning turn they gracefully sweep at a
downward angle with fearful velocity for any given distance with the
wind, and then with the most consummate ease bring up “ all stand-
ing,” poised as before, the wings meantime remaining stiff, but
scarcely horizontal, at the time the bird prepares to turn. Such a re-
sistance do they offer to a storm that sometimes when a bird is bal-
anced a short distance overhead one can almost imagine seeing the
wind rushing past its form. They have never been seen to approach
the water closer than 300 feet, while, on the other hand, they often
soar upward to a considerable height. The evident method these
birds adopt to ascend is peculiar, and very interesting to watch at
close quarters. For, though the bird itself is practically rigid, except
for slight movements—particular parts of which have been alluded
to—yet those simple actions really explain how the bird rises. ‘Thus,

SOME BIRD LIFE IN BRITISH PAPUA. 417

in addition to what has already been stated, they consist of upward
and downward motions, as if, while pressing against the wind,
advantage is taken when a lull occurs (see Fig. A): and, secondly,
with head still to windward, allowing itself to fall back a few yards
as though for a “ breather,” but still maintaining a slight upward
tendency during the progress (see Fig. B). Then repetitions ad lib.
(See diagram. )

Their rate of speed when with the wind would be quite 60 to 70
miles an hour, if not more.

Mr. Louis Beck, writing in the Pall Mall Gazette, mentions the
frigate bird as the swiftest of all sea birds, and in some of the equa-
torial isles of the Pacific it is used as a letter carrier. Taken from
the nest before it can fly, it is hand fed on a fish diet by the natives,
and in the course of a few months becomes so tame that it can be
hberated during the day and will return to its perch at sunset. In
the records of the London Missionary Society mention is made of
the letter-carrying frigate birds of the Ellice group (northwest of
Samoa), and that writer, who resided in those islands for three
years, had frequent opportunities of witnessing their performances.

In the northern division the following birds have been recorded
as existing there, and it would be interesting at a future date to
Jearn of their respective peculiarities. They are the dollar bird
(Lurystomus), New Guinea pheasant, weaver bird, and flycatcher
(Monachella muelleriana). Brilliantly hued finches, wagtails, and
racquet-tailed kingfishers (Zanysiptera microrhyncha) also excite
curiosity. White-headed sea hawks (//aliastur girrenera) are not
numerous, but are sufficient to make the owners of chickens very
wrathful, owing to their depredations in the poultry run.

It may not, by the way, be out of place to devote a few lines to the
native breed of domestic fowls. The male is a very pretty bird, very
like a gamecock, with a long pendant on either side of the tail. A
pure white variety is also bred, and is highly prized by the Papuans.
Query: Where did these birds originally come from? All explana-
tions are vague on the matter.

In the islands and several parts of the mainland curlews, golden
plovers, and herons, both black and white, are free agents, and at as
high an altitude as 6,000 feet on the main range the rare orange-
erested bower bird (Amblyornis subalaris) has its playground,

Respecting the “death bird” of New Guinea, too much credence
should not be indulged in until confirmed. Native myths are numer-
ous and extraordinary, even precise in details. The moon, we are
impressively told by some Papuans, was originally found in the soil
by one of their number, who, in attempting to carry the luminary to
his village barely escaped with his life through not relinquishing the
prize as it ascended heavenward.

BIRD SANCTUARIES OF NEW ZEALAND-

New Zealand has done two things thoroughly, as the following
paper from The Argus of July 23, 1904, will show. One of these
is to preserve those wingless birds so characteristic of the country,
and which, because of their helplessness, would soon disappear as
settlement increased; the other is to acclimatize the best game of
other countries. Thus, in turning Canadian moose in their moun-
tains, they brought a Canadian forester to look after the young
calves, and a Scotch gamekeeper is now engaged in attending to the
grouse. Resolution Island, in Dusky Sound, West Coast, discovered
by Captain Cook, is named after one of the ships in which Cook made
his first voyage. There is material for a charming little book on
nature in this official document, the last place a Victorian, knowing
something of the character of his own government reports, would
look for it. And Mr. Henry’s chat about the birds which are in his
charge and have become, in some instances, his pets and friends, is so
homely, so sympathetic, shows so much of close and loving observa-
tion, that something material to the literature of nature in New Zea-
land would have been lost had the notes not been published.

The wingless birds that are being given sanctuary on Resolution
Island are the weka, or wood hen (Ocydromus australis), the kakapo,
or great ground parrot (Stringops habroptilus), the roa (Apteryax
haasti), and the kiwi, or apteryx (Apterya oweni). In addition to
these, which are his special charge, Mr. Henry writes of all the birds
which are either native to or visit the island. It is the wingless ones,
however, that are of chief interest. Had New Zealand possessed
among its native fauna any destructive animals, such as the Austra-
han dingo or the Tasmanian devil, these birds would have been
extinct long ago. In settled country both dogs and cats play havoc
with them, and the English weasel, which, as Mr. Henry observes,
would never have been introduced had its habits been known thor-
oughly, is also destructive. When rabbits became such a nuisance
that poisoned wheat was laid for them, some of the wingless birds
were killed in thousands, like the English pheasants, which have
been so successfully acclimatized. In many of the public reserves of

420 BIRD SANCTUARIES OF NEW ZEALAND.

New Zealand, such as the charming gardens at New Plymouth, one
van hear the pheasant calling constantly in the brush, and it is this
thick native underwood which gave originally complete protection
to the wingless birds.

The weka, or wood hen, is evidently one of the most interesting of
the residents on Resolution Island. The quaint ways and quick
sagacity of two of them, “ Chicken” and “Scrag,” who visit the
‘aretaker’s house on the lookout for table scraps, and share the con-
tents of the dog’s dish without risk, are amusingly described. These
birds mate for life, and take turn about in hatching and protecting
the brood. One of them is never absent from the nest from the time
the first egg is laid until the young, which look lke balls of soft
down, are able to protect themselves. This care is the more neces-
sary, as both the eggs and young are destroyed by rats, weasels, and
sparrow hawks. Sometimes, of an evening, when the tide is low,
the wood hens take their families out on the beaches, and the spar-
row hawks watch for them there and kill the young by scores. The
weka is, in its turn, destructive. Paradise ducks (Casarca variegata) ,
like the wild ducks of Australia, cover up their eggs carefully with a
mat of down when leaving the nest, but the wekas have an heredi-
tary knowledge of the trick, and a young bird, which has never seen
a duck’s nest, tears away the down to get at the eggs the moment it
discovers one. If they find a hen’s nest with the eggs uncovered,
they always go through the motions of tearing away the nest before
starting to eat the eggs. Although on friendly terms with the care-
taker, they hide their own nests away from him very carefully, and,
if one of the pair comes to the house for scraps for its mate, it always
takes a roundabout track to the nest, and is careful to see that it is
neither watched nor followed. They kill each other’s young, so that
every pair on the island has its own run, and no others are allowed
to intrude. Mr. Henry considers these birds most valuable as insect
destroyers in an orchard, and observes that, if they were difficult to
get, fruit growers would be quite keen about them. On the table-
land above the Otira Gorge, when crossing from the west coast, one
often sees the weka and her brood running along the track in front
of the coach. When the first brood have been hatched and are fairly
grown, the hen hands them over to her mate and starts to lay again.
The male shepherds the young persistently, apparently gives them
all the food he can find, and if they call fer help in danger he is with
them in an instant, keen for a fight. When he finds a rat he tackles
it instantly, though not strong enough to kill it single handed. The
squeaking of the rat is a signal to another weka, who rushes up and
helps to kill the enemy.

It is surmised that the kakapo, or great ground parrot—the only
parrot which does not fly—had once the use of its wings. Finding in
BIRD SANCTUARIES OF NEW ZEALAND. 42}

New Zealand no ground enemies and abundance of food and cover,
it ceased to use its wings, which only subjected it to the risk of being
taken by a hawk, and as the wings degenerated from disuse the legs
developed in the same proportion, so that now it is a good runner.
Tree parrots in Australia are awkard on the ground, but the seed-
ating grass parrots all run quickly. In addition to the islands,
which are so convenient a sanctuary, the government has two pre-
serves for kakapos on the mainland. They are night feeders, though
fruit eaters, an unusual combination, as Mr. Henry points out. Like
the owls, they have a disk of prominent feathers about the eves, and
near the nose those long hair-like feathers or feelers common to noc-
turnal birds or those which have their home underground. They are
so feeble, so unconscious of having enemies, that one may go up to
them without their showing any alarm. If touched they are resent-
ful, but if you sit down beside the bird a little while in daylight it
tucks its head calmly under its wing and goes off to sleep again.
Unlike the wega, the kakapo hides her nest away carefully from her
own mate, who is generally both fat and indolent. These birds only
breed every second year, and the curious point about them is that all
the birds lay in the same season—a peculiarity which naturalists are
quite unable to undertsand. Their call at night is very much like the
booming of a bittern in the swamps, and the night drumming is only
heard just before the nesting time. In the following year they are
silent. The birds are always plentiful where wild berries grow
thickly, and New Zealanders speak of such spots as “ kakapo gar-
dens.” The young, when first hatched, are covered with snow-white
down. The holes so frequently found in their gardens, where they
have scratched, suggest that they dig for truffles, and it is known that
they eat mushrooms.

The roa, another of the wingless birds, is distinguished by its
wonderful beak—long, slender, and shghtly curved. This, too, is a
night bird, and rarely found far away from forests. It uses its
long, snipe-like bill just for the same purpose that the snipe does its
bill, except that it works in harder ground, and its chief food is earth-
worms. Its sight is poor, but nature, as is usually the case, compen-
sates for this defect by sharpening up its sense of smell and hearing.
When seen in the moonlight, it moves slowly along with its bill out-
stretched, and often stands with the point of its bill resting upon the
earth, as though either trying to scent the worms or feel for their
movements underground. The peculiar thing about their breeding
habits is that a young bird a week or so old and a fresh egg are fre-
quently found in the same nest. Like the wekas, the parent roas share
the cares of a family, though in another way—the male does all the
hatching. The young are born with all their feathers ke mature
birds, and apparently all their intelligence as well, for as soon as they
422 BIRD SANCTUARIES OF NEW ZEALAND.

are hatched they start to search for their own food, and require no
hints as to the best place to find it. The single egg, like that of the
mutton bird, is exceptionally large. Thus, in the nesting season the
hen, always in fine condition, weighs about 8 pounds, the “ hatcher ”
5 pounds and the eggs 18 ounces.

The gray kiwi is described as a shy, gentle, little thing, that seems
to depend wholly for its existence on its ability to hide away in lonely
places. They are shaped much like the roa, but have straight beaks.

t is a lght-loving bird, that feds by day mostly upon white grubs.
It resembles the roa in its breeding habits, laying one large egg,
hatched by the male bird, but while, in the nesting season, the pair of
roas are rarely separated the kiwis are just as rarely found together.
The young are very beautiful birds, quite silent, but so alert and cau-
tious that if you take your eyes off them for a while they disappear.
When grown, they have a shrill, whistling note, which Mr. Henry
describes as like a guard’s whistle in a railway train heard a little way
of. In summer both the roa and the kiwi like to go up to the high
ground, affecting naked mountain crests, and their pathways are
clearly marked. The kiwi builds in a short burrow underground,
generally protected at the mouth by the root of a tree. In the case of
both the roa and kiwi, it looks as though the male bird hatched con-
tinuously for about thirty days. They go on the nest fat and plump,
and by the time the young bird is hatched are feeble skeletons.
THE HOUSE SPARROW.

By Dr. J. O. SKINNER, U. S. Army (Retired).

Mr. Thompson, a Canadian, referring, about twenty-two vears ago,
to the unwise introduction into the United States of this intolerable
nuisance when its character and habits were so well known in Eng-
lund, made the following statement: “ What wonder that the Eng-
lish farmer stared in blank amazement when first he heard of it, or
that he failed to account for the action, except on the assumption
that America bad been visited by a wave of temporary insanity.”
We shall attempt to briefly give a few of the facts from which this
inference was doubtless drawn.

The house sparrow (Passer domesticus), commonly called in Amer-
ica the “ English ” sparrow, has been known for ages as one of the
worst of feathered pests. The name * English ” sparrow is mislead-
ing, since it would indicate that it originated in England which is
not really the case, for its history begins with that of man, and it is
referred to by Aristotle and many other European writers on natural
history who followed him; in fact, there is reason for believing that
it was known to people of whom we have no written history. When
writing was invented the sparrow was selected for the hieroglyphic
symbolizing enemy, and proofs of its destructive habits have been
cited by certain authors showing that it has been the enemy of man-
kind for more than five thousand years. This prolific little poacher,
belonging to the granivorous family (/7ringillidac), not only does
much damage to grain, fruit, and other products of the soil, and dis-
figures all buildings used by it for nesting purposes, but it is so pugi-
Nstic that it drives away many insectivorous birds which are of
great benefit to those engaged in agriculture or horticulture. More
than any other wild bird, it is attached to human dwellings and is
not known to thrive anywhere far away from the habitations or
works of men, extending its range in new countries as settlements
are formed and lands are cultivated.

It has already fully adapted itself to all continents and has been
transported to some of the most distant islands in the Indian and

Pacific oceans.
, 423
494 THE HOUSE SPARROW.

In the fall of 1850, Mr. Nicolas Pike, of Brooklyn, N. Y¥., brought
over from Europe eight pairs of this bird and turned them loose the
following spring. For some unaccountable reason, unless it be that
they were the recipients of too much kindness, they did not thrive,
and in 1852 a second and more successful effort was made. In 185+
and 1858 it was introduced at Portland, Me., and at Peacedale, R. L,
und a few birds escaped at Boston.

During the next ten years it was imported direct from Europe to
eight other cities, and in one case 1,000 birds were sent to Philadelphia
in a single lot. By 1870 it had become established as far south as
Columbia, S. C., Louisville, Ky., and Galveston, Tex.: as far west as
St. Louis, Mo., and Davenport, Iowa, and so far north as Montreal,
Canada, thus gaining a residence in 20 States, the District of Colum-
bia, and 2 provinces of Canada, and the end of its migration was not
yet. Between 1870 and 1880 it had extended its habitat over 15,000
square miles, and in 1873 Salt Lake City and San Francisco had been
reached by this rapid colonizer. Even this extended area did not
satisfy its migratory instincts, for during the next five years it estab-
lished itself in more than 500,000 square miles of territory, and by 1886
35 States and 5 Territories, practically all of the country east of the
Mississippi (except parts of 3 Southern States), as well as 8 Western
States, had been invaded and occupied. Its range of habitation now
covered, including nearly 150,000 square miles in Canada, over
1,000,000 square miles, and by 1898 only 3 States (Wyoming, Nevada,
and Montana) and 3 Territories (New Mexico, Arizona, and Alaska)
were free. It is presumed that by this time it has reached even those
districts, and its occupancy of the entire United States is complete.

Besides the United States, New Zealand and Australia have been
much damages by the “ English” sparrow, it being regarded in
certain Australian colonies as a nuisance almost equal to the rabbit.
Although introduced by an acclimatization society on the North
Island of New Zealand in 1866, it threatened, sixteen years later,
to spread over the whole island, since it appeared in the most inac-
cessible places, contrary to its usual preference for cities and towns.
This was no doubt due to overcrowding, the result of its rapid
propagation. Having been carried to Victoria in 1865, it was not
iong before it discovered and occupied Queensland, New South
Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania, although thus far it has
been excluded from Western Australia by vigorous legal measures
prohibiting its introduction. It will no doubt reach there in due
time on its own transportation. It has already migrated to many
other parts of the world and may be regarded as a veritable little
cosmopolite. It is also present on Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean,
and having reached Honolulu twenty years ago, it is fair to assume
that if it has not already “ prospected ” our possessions in tle Philip-
THE HOUSE SPARROW. 495

pine Islands, it will do so very soon. On the Atlantic side it is found in
Bermuda, the Bahamas, and Cuba, and possibly Porto Rico, although
its presence there has not yet been reported. Its conduct in Bermuda
since it was sent there in 1874 has been just as objectionable as else-
where, so that, after at first punishing with a prescribed fine anyone
who attempted its destruction, the lawmakers themselves were obliged,
ten years later, to change their code by placing a legal premium on
its extermination. Although the area of the islands is less than 20
square miles, nearly $38,000 was expended in two years for this
purpose with no appreciable effeet, so numerous had become the
progeny of this prolific profligate.

Although the house sparrow is now very generally distributed over
Pennsylvania, it first appeared in the Cumberland Valley (Cham-
bersburg) of that State about 1872, according to the observations of
Mr. Davidson Greenawalt, and may have emigrated there from Ship-
pensburg, where one pair was carried from Philadelphia about 186s.

It considers itself at home everywhere, apparently, and evidently
comes to stay wherever found. There is no instance in ornithology
where any other bird has multiphed so rapidly or covered such an
extensive area in so short a time. This is not altogether surprising
when it is remembered how much it has been assisted until recently,
by persons unfamiliar with or indifferent to its character and habits.

Not only has it been transported intentionally from place to place,
but has been pampered until the mistake was made too manifest to be
longer ignored. The number of eggs in a set varies from four to
seven, and one pair of birds usually raises four, sometimes five, and
even six broods, according to some observers, in a year. It takes
very little computation to determine what the results of this extraor-
dinary fecundity would presumably be in a single decade. As it
always prefers cities, towns, or villages—in fact, does not go to the
country except at harvest times, until it is crowded out by overpopu-
lation following its rapid propagation—it is further protected, by
this choice of habitation,against the dangers and hardships by
which the increase of many other birds is restricted. As a rule

excessive reproduction cf a species in the animal kingdom, with its
consequent overcrowding, results in disease (epidemics or parasites)
which prevent its unlimited multiplication. This is not the case with
the house sparrow; it is one of the most vigorous of birds, notwith-
standing its numerous progeny. It adapts itself wonderfully to
diverse conditions, being able to endure the prolonged heat of trop-
ical summer as well as to survive the protracted cold of a Canadian
winter.

In view of the reputation and record of this bird wherever found,
and the repeated warnings given to those who were about to import
it, the continued interest in it and persistent effort to secure and sue-
426 THE HOUSE SPARROW.

cor it have been, indeed, difficult to understand, unless in the belief
that it was done with the mistaken idea that it would destroy insect
pests, particularly canker worms, in the parks of cities, and where it
was originally introduced. This error was pointed out at the time,
but was ignored; in fact, such a sparrow “boom” existed at one
period in this country that parties so infatuated found it cheaper to
import direct from Europe than from New York and other places
at home. There were two classes who always seemed anxious to
have the house sparrow in this country. One was the European
part of our population, who, remembering the surroundings of the
homes they had left, longed for its familiar chirp and suggestive
cheerfulness; the other was that class of people who thought they
were getting an insectivore, although they were informed by com-
petent authority to the contrary. Now, there is an insectivorous
bird called and known in England as the hedge sparrow, but which
is no sparrow at all. It is the Accentor modularis, belonging to
an entirely different family (Sylviidw), the old-world warblers, is
related to the thrushes, and, like all of its family, feeds on insects
almost entirely, while the sparrow family proper are mainly graniv-
orous, except in the spring and summer when raising their young,
which they feed on insects and other soft food. It is reasonable to
suppose that the importer of the house sparrow confused it in his
mind with the hedge sparrow. ;

Sonnim, in the Dictionaire d'Histoire Naturelle, nearly a century
ago, writes that sparrows lived “ only in society with man, dividing
with him his grair® his fruit, and his home; they attack the first
fruit that ripens, the grain as it approaches maturity, and even that
which has been stored in granaries.” Te also states that “ 82 grains
of wheat were counted in the craw of a sparrow shot by the writer;
and Rougier de la Bergerie, to whom we owe excellent memoirs on
rural economy, estimates that the sparrows of France consume annu-
ally 10,000,000 bushels of wheat.” Reports from France have been
confirmed by those from other countries, and the character of the
house sparrow has been discussed in France, Germany, and Great
Britain for more than four centuries. The damage done by it to
agriculture and horticulture has been immense, simply incalculable,
for it has been inflicted directly and indirectly.

Jesides the direct injury by it to grain crops (wheat, corn, oats,
rye, barley, buckwheat, etc.), to fruits, garden seeds, vegetables, and
to buds, blossoms, and foliage of trees and vines, is also that resulting
indirectly from its molestation of other wild birds which are known
to be decidedly beneficial to the garden and farm, Testimony has
been secured showing that there are at least 70 kinds of these, includ-
ing martins, swallows, wrens, and bluebirds, which are interfered
with to the great loss of farmers and gardeners. It not only succeeds
THE HOUSE SPARROW. 497

in many instances in preventing many desirable birds from nesting,
by oecupying their premises and driving them away, but it even de-
vours their eggs while they are absent finding and feeding on insects.

For fifteen years, say from 1855 to 1870, after its colonization in
America, the protests against its introduction were confined to a few
well-informed naturalists and to such naturalized persons as had ob-
served its ravages elsewhere. Gradually, however, its advocates and
defenders became less numerous. The evidence of the little criminal’s
guilt was irrefutable, as determined by competent witnesses in the
form of innumerable dissections.

Many methods, legislative and otherwise, it is true, have been
adopted and pursued in various places to exterminate it, but without
success. Pennsylvania enacted the following law June 4, 1883:

Sec. 1. Be it enacted, etc., That from and after the passage of this act it shall
be lawful at any season of the year to kill or in any way destroy the small bird
known as the English sparrow.

Many other States have done as much and more. Some towns and
counties have offered bounties. One State (Michigan) paid at one
time a bounty of 1 cent per head on English sparrows.

Shooting, poisoning, trapping, and nest destroying have been
resorted to without any appreciable effect.

Probably the most promising method of checking its increase would
be the systematic destruction of its nests and eggs during the breeding
season. This has never been done on a large scale, although a few
years ago the city of Boston undertook to clear the nests from Boston
Common. About 4,000 nests and 1,000 eggs were destroyed, but after
three weeks the work was stopped by order of the mayor.

The northern shrike is known to kill English sparrows, but since
it occurs in the United States only in winter, and does not usually
frequent cities or towns, its work as a sparrow destroyer would be
problematical. The outlook for relief from this pest and nuisance
is therefore serious and discouraging.

A letter received by the writer from the late Dr. Ellott Coues, one
of the leading ornithologists of his day, relative to this matter, con-
tains the following disheartening statement :

The multiplication of these early lots and of many later ones has given the
invincible foreigner an assured foothold over most of the United States from
which he will never be dislodged. The case is paralleled in Australia and New
Zealand. I led the “sparrow war” for twenty years and only surrendered to
the inevitable. You may do what you please, shoot or poison as many as you
can, more will come to the funeral, and nothing you can do will make any
appreciable difference. The case is hopeless.

seriously interfered with by it, and the writer has frequently seen
the martin dispossessed, after a desperate resistance, of the premises
provided for it by farmers, and ultimately driven away entirely by
the sparrow, from its home and neighborhood.

Referring to the advent of the English sparrow, the Kansas City
Journal quoted some time ago from the Topeka Journal as having
“an account of the first English sparrows brought to Kansas. In
1864, I. W. Giles conceived the idea of importing some of these birds.
He shipped in all 28 of them. They were confined in cages at his
place in Topeka until all but 5 had died. At last the 5 were turned
loose to take their chances of life or death, though Giles had no hope
that they would live. They fooled him. They took up their home
in the neighborhood. The following autumn there were 12 birds.
The second season found 60, and the third summer about 3,000. Then
they increased so fast that no account could be kept, and in the
twenty-five years which followed they spread all over the West.”
SOME TIBETAN ANIMALS.¢
By R. LYDEKKER.

Naturalists are speculating whether the opening up of Tibet, which
is practically sure to follow the present expedition to Lassa. will
result in the discovery of any new animals of special interest. So far
as the smaller mammals, such as mice, rats, squirrels, shrews, ete., are
concerned, it can not be doubted that systematic collecting will be sure
to yield a certain number of new forms. With regard to the larger
mammals, the case 1s, however, different, and it would be unwise to
expect that any strikingly new type is likely to turn up, although
important information will doubtless be obtained in due course with
regard to the mode of life and the nature of the habitat of several
of the mammals already known to us. The reasons for taking this
somewhat discouraging view as to the prospects of discovering new
animals of large size in Tibet are as follows:

In the first place, although few Europeans have hitherto actually
reached Lassa, the country has been traversed to the northward of
that city from east to west—notably by Messrs. Bower and Thorold
in 1892—by travelers who have done all in their power to collect
specimens of the fauna; while many sportsmen, naturalists, and col-
lectors have penetrated far into the interior from either the eastern or
the western border. Moreover, the typical Tibetan fauna inhabiting
the high plateaus above 14,000 feet is closely allied to, if not absolutely
identical with, that of eastern Ladak, which lies within the limits of
Kashmir territory, and has therefore for many years past been readily
accessible to Europeans. On the other hand, the mammals of the
somewhat lower and apparently more or less wooded districts forming
the eastern portion of Tibet range into the northwestern provinces of

430 SOME TIBETAN ANIMALS.

China, such as Shansi and Kansu, where they have of late years been
collected by Mr. F. W. Styan, an English tea planter. Not that our
information with regard to the mammals of eastern Tibet depends
by any means solely on the collections made in Kansu and Shansi.
On the contrary, the great French missionary explorer, Abbé David,
succeeded many years ago in penetrating into the heart of the Moupin
district of eastern Tibet, whence he brought back a number of mam-
mals belonging to types previously unknown to science. Practically
all that has resulted from subsequent exploration and collection is to
prove the extension of the range of these peculiar types into western
China, and to add to them a few species differing only in compara-:
tively trivial features. The absence of any distinctly new types in
this west Chinese fauna seems to point to the improbability of any
striking novelty among the larger types of animal life remaining to
be discovered in Tibet.

Of the strange animals first brought from eastern Tibet by Abbé
David, and subsequently obtained
by Mr. Styan in western China, by
far the most remarkable is the crea-
ture now known to naturalists as
the great panda (.27uropus mela-
noleucus), although at one time de-
nominated the particolored bear
(fig. 1). In appearance this ani-
mal is, indeed, strangely bear-like,
although far inferior in bodily size
to most members of the Urs:dw, the rudimentary tail, plantigrade
feet, short ears, and broad head being all ursine features. Moreover,
it is not a little remarkable that a species of true bear (Ursus pruin-
osus) inhabiting Tibet not infrequently presents a type of coloration
approximating to that of the great panda, in which the legs and
underparts, together with a band across the shoulders and a ring
round each eye, are sooty black, while all the rest is pure white. On
the other hand, when the face of the great panda is compared with
that of the much smaller and long-tailed arboreal animal inhabiting
the eastern Himalaya, and known as the true panda (.4lurus ful-
gens), a marked resemblance can be detected, and when careful com-
parison between the teeth and skeletons of the two animals is made, it
becomes apparent that the great panda is much more nearly related
to the long-tailed species than it is to the bears. In fact, these two
animals appear to be the Old World representatives of the raccoons
and coatis of America, and thus afford one more instance of the close
affinity existing between the faunas of eastern Asia and North Amer-

ica. The teeth of the great panda (fig. 2) are most beautiful and
interesting objects—on the whole approaching much nearer to those
of the lesser panda than to the ursine type. Of the habits of the great
panda, we are at pres-
ent in complete ignor-
ance; but on this
point we may hope in
time to be enlightened
by the opening up of
Tibet. Whether we

creature alive in the

Regents Park, it is difficult even to guess. Probably the great panda
is a native of the more or less wooded districts of eastern Tibet, and
not of the arid and elevated central plateau.

The same must undoubtedly be the case with the Tibetan snub-
nosed monkey (Rhinopi-
theeus rorellanw) (hig. 3),
which was lkewise the
first-known — representa-
tive of a new. generic
type discovered in the
Moupin district of east-
erm Tibet by the Abbé
David. It has, however,

been subsequently — ob-
FG. 3.--Orange snub-nosed monkey. tained in Szechuan, while
a second representative of
the genus has been discovered in northwest China and a third in
the mountains bordering the Mekong River. That the Tibetan repre-,
sentative of the snub-nosed monkeys, at all events, is a native of a
cold climate may be inferred from its massive and “* chubby ” build
and its thick coat, which in winter forms a long, silky mantle of great
beauty on the back. As to the peculiar form of the nose, so utterly
unlike that of ordinary monkeys, the suspicion arises that it may be
in some way connected with life at a high altitude, seeing that the
Chiru antelope, to be noticed later on, has gone in for a very strange
development in the way of noses. At present, however, we are very
much in the dark as to the relative height of the districts in which
these strange monkeys are found.
Nothing special need be said with regard to the above-mentioned
Tibetan bear, except that it appears to be a peculiar species. The
mere mention that the snow-leopard (/elis uncia) is an inhabitant of

‘
432 SOME TIBETAN ANIMALS.

the Tibet plateau must likewise suffice, seeing that this handsome cat
has a wide range in central Asia.

Several species of deer are found in or near Tibet, although all of
them appear to be confined to the wooded districts bordering the arid
central plateau. The finest of these is undoubtedly the shou (Cervus
affinis), a species allied to the red deer, inhabiting the forests some-
where near the head of the Chumbi Valley, in Sikhim. This deer is
very rare in collections, where it is represented mainly by skulls and
antlers, but it is probable that specimens will before long be forth-
coming. A young individual is stated to have been killed during the
early days of the Tibet expedition. Thorold’s deer (C. albirostris)
is a rather smaller and much darker colored species, readily distin-
guished by its white muzzle and the comparatively simple antlers. It
exhibits the relatively heavy build characteristic of species inhabiting
cold countries. This fine deer was first cbtained in the wooded dis-
tricts to the north of Lassa by the Russian explorer Przewalski, and
subsequently by the English traveler Doctor Thorold, to whom the
British Museum is indebted for its specimen. The third deer peculiar
to the country is the Tibetan tufted deer (Zlaphodus cephalophus),
a species of the approximate size of a roebuck, and typifying a pe-
culiar genus. In general character this deer is nearly related to the
Indian and Malay muntjaes (Cervulus), the bucks being armed with
similar long tusks in the upper jaw, but the antlers are even smaller
than in the latter, being reduced to mere knobs, and there are distinc-
tive peculiarities in the skull. This interesting deer was first obtained
by the Abbé David in the Moupin district of eastern Tibet, but a sec-
ond species was soon afterwards secured near Ningpo, in eastern
China, while a third kind has recently been described from the moun-
tains near Ichang, in central China.

In hollow-horned ruminants (oxen, sheep, antelopes, etc.) Tibet is
specially rich, many of the species being peculiar to the country,
where several of them are confined to the high central arid plateau.

The first place in this group must undoubtedly be assigned to the
yak (Bos grunniens), one of the finest and largest of the wild oxen,
specially characterized by the great growth of long, shaggy hair along
the flanks and underparts of the body and the well-known bushy tail.
In this country, unfortunately, a somewhat false impression of the
yak is prevalent, owing to the fact that all the specimens hithérto
imported belong either to a small domesticated breed from Darjiling
or to half-breeds, the latter being generally black and white, instead
of the uniform black distinctive of the pure-bred and wild animal.
None of such half-breeds can compare with the magnificent half-
tamed animals kept by the natives of the elevated Rupsu Plateau, to
the south of the Indus, where they afford the cnly means of transport
by this route between Ladak and India. And even these Rupsu
SOME TIBETAN ANIMALS. Ee

beasts are inferior to the wild yak, which stands nearly 6 feet at the
shoulder. These magnificent animals are absolutely confined to the
arid central plateau, on some parts of which, hitherto closed to Euro-
peans, they are said to be comparatively numerous.

Another native of the same bare plateau is the Tibetan argali, or
wild sheep (QOvis ammon hodgsont), a magnificent animal, with horns
of wonderfully massive proportions in the old rams. Since, however,
this species is only a local variety of the true argali of central Asia
generally, it is of less interest than the types exclusively confined to
the country. The same may be said of the shapoo, or Tibetan urial
(Ovis vignet), which is the typi-
‘al race of a smaller race of wild
sheep, whose range extends in
one direction into northwestern
India and in another into Persia.
A third species of wild sheep,
the bharal, or blue sheep (Ovis
nahura), readily distinguished
by its smooth and peculiarly
curved horns and close gray-
blue coat with black points, is,
however, absolutely characteris-
tic of the arid Tibetan plateau,
on which it is found in large
flocks. On the other hand, the
Asiatic ibex (Capra sibirica),
which frequents the more craggy
ground instead of the rolling up-
lands, is a species with a very
wide distribution in central Asia.

Although the yak and_ the
bharal may be regarded as rep-
senting by themselves distinct Ys
subgeneric types, all the hollow- F1a. 4.—Head of male chiru.
horned ruminants hitherto men-

tioned are members of widely spread genera. We now come, how-
ever, to a remarkable species, which is the sole representative of a
genus quite apart from any other and absolutely restricted to the arid
central plateau. This is the graceful chiru, or Tibetan antelope
(Pantholops hogsoni), of which the bucks are armed with long,
slender, and heavily ridged horns of an altogether peculiar type
(fig. 4), while the does are hornless. Possibly this handsome ante-
lope may be the original of the mythical unicorn, a solitary buck,
when seen in profile, looking exactly as if it had but a ‘single
sM, 190428

434 SOME TIBETAN ANIMALS.

long straight horn. Although far from uncommon, chiru are
very wary, and consequently difficult to approach. Like all Tibetan
animals, they have a firm thick ceat, formed in this instance of close
woolly hair of a gray-fawn color. The most peculiar feature about
the chiru is, however, its swollen puffy nose, which is probably con-
nected with breathing a highly rarified atmosphere. This antelope
has never been exhibited alive in a menagerie, and, as is the case
with the other large mammals of the central desert plateau of Tibet,
it would probably not live if removed from its native uplands to ordi-
nary levels. A second antelope inhabiting the same country as the
chiru is the goa (Gazella picticaudata),a member of the gazille group,
characterized by the peculiar form of the horns of the bucks and cer-
tain features of coloration, whereby it is markedly distinguished from
all its kindred save one or two other central Asiatic species.

The most remarkable of all the Tibetan hollow-horned ruminants is,
however, the takin (Budorcas taxicolor), of which the typical repre-
sentative inhabits the Mishmi Hills, in the southeast corner of the
country, immediately north of the Assam Valley, while a second
variety is found farther east in the Moupin district. The takin,
which may be compared in size to a Kerry cow, is a clumsily built
brute with yellowish-brown hair and curiously curved horns, which
in some degree recall those of the South African white-tailed gnu.
Its nearest relatives appear to be the serows of the outer Himalaya
and the Malay countries, which are in many respects intermediate
between goats and antelopes. As it lacks the thick woolly coat of
the chiru and the goa, there can be little doubt that it inhabits a coun-
try with a less severe climate than that of the central Tibetan pla-
teau, and it is probably a native of the more or less wooded districts
of comparatively low elevation forming the outskirts of Tibet. It
is one of the few large animals that hitherto appears never to have
fallen to the rifle of a European.

With the large and handsome wild ass or wild horse (for it is, to a
great extent, intermediate between the two), locally known as the
kiang, we return once more to a characteristic denizen of the desert
plateau forming the heart of Tibet. The nang (L’quus hemionus
hiang) stands close on 13 hands at the shoulder, and is of a bright red
bay in color, with the muzzle, underparts, and legs dazzling white.
Its ears (fig. 5) are relatively much shorter and its hoofs much
broader than in the true wild asses of Africa, from which it also
differs markedly in color, while its ery is somewhat between a bray
and a neigh. In the higher and more open parts of Ladak, kiang
are to be seen in large numbers; and they come galloping round the
convoy of the traveler in circles, with their heads carried high in the
air, so that the face is almost horizontal. Whether the kiang is en-

titled to be ranked as a distinet species, or whether it should be
regarded merely as a variety of the chigetai, or wild ass of Mon-
golia, and the lowlands of central Asia generally, is a moot point.
3ut, be this as it may, the creature is absolutely confined to the
central desert plateau of Tibet, where in winter it develops a coat
as thick and rough as a door mat, in order to afford effectual protec-
tion against the rigors of that season at such an altitude.

In addition to the foregoing list of large mammals, Tibet is like-
wise the home of a number of peculiar species of smaller. size.
Among these it must, however, suffice to make mention of only two on
the present occasion. Firstly, there is a remarkable species of water
shrew, differing in many respects from the common water shrew
(Neomys fodiens), and accordingly referred to a genus by itself
under the name of Vectogale elegans. Of that genus it is the sole
known representative. When we are
fully acquainted with it the Tibetan
palm civet (Paradoxurus laniger),
at present known only by a single
skin obtained so long ago as 1836,
will prove almost as interesting a
species, for it 1s quite probable that
it will turn out to be generally dis-
tinct from the palm civets of India
and the Malay countries, from which
it differs by its woolly coat.

Such a large number of peculiar
generic and specific types of mam- Fi. 5.—Head of kiang.
mals restricted to a continental area
of the comparatively small size of the Tibetan plateau is a feature
unparalleled elsewhere, and to find an analogous instance we must
take the case of an island like Celebes, which has been isolated for
ages from all surrounding lands. It would seem, therefore, that
Tibet has been similarly isolated, so far as immigration and emigra-
tion of its animal fauna is concerned, for a vast period of time; an
insulation due, doubtless, to its great elevation above the sea level, and
the consequent severity of its climate and rarity of its atmosphere.
Climatic peculiarities of this nature can only be endured by animals
especially adapted to such conditions of existence, and it is accord-
ingly only natural to expect that when once the Tibetan fauna had
become modified for the needs of its environment it would have re-
mained permanently isolated from that of the surrounding countries.

THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES.*

+

By Dr. J. Cossar Ewart, F. R. 8.

Hitherto it has been generally assumed that wild horses have been
long extinct, that all domestic horses are the descendants of a single
wild species, and that, except in size, ponies in no essential points
differ from horses.

Now that systematic attempts are being made to improve native
breeds of horses in various parts of the world, it is obviously desir
able to settle onee for all whether, as is alleged, occidental as well as
oriental and African races and breeds have sprung from the same
wild progenitors, and more especially if all ponies are merely dwarf
specimens of one or more of the recognized domestic breeds of horses.

To be in a position to arrive at a conclusion as to the origin of the
carious kinds of domestic horses, and at the same time find an answer
to the important and oft-repeated question, What is a pony? one must
clear up as far as possible the later chapters in the history of that
section of the Equide to which the true horses belong.

It is generally admitted that the ancestors of the living Equide
reached the Old World from the New, the later immigrants crossing
by land bridges in the vicinity of Bering Straits. If horses came
originally from the New World, to the New World we may turn for
information as to their remote progenitors.

According to recent inquiries, North America possessed in_ pre-
Glacial times at least nine perfectly distinet wild species of Equidee.

e. 2, Nguus complicatus ot

Some of these were of a considerable size
the southern and middle western States, and 2’. occidentalus of Cali-
fornia were as large as a small cart horse. Others were intermediate
in size—e. g@., H. fraternis of the southeastern States; and at least
W. tau of Mexico—was extremely small. Some of the American

pre-Glacial Equide were characterized by very large heads and short,
strong limbs, some by small heads and slender limbs, and although
the majority conformed to the true horse type, two or three were
constructed on the lines of asses and zebras.

438 THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES.

When true horses first made their appearance in America the cli-
mate and the land connections between the Old World and the New
were very different from what they are to-day. One result of these
differences was that before the close of the Pliocene period—i. e., prior
to the great Ice age—it was possible for American horses to find their
way into Asia and thence into Europe and Africa. One of the earlier
immigrants (#quus stenonis) has left its remains in the Pliocene
deposits of Britain, France, Switzerland, Italy, and the north of
Africa. While 7’. stenonis was extending its range into Europe and
Africa, two others (7. sivalensis and FH. namadicus) were finding
their way into India, and yet other species were doubtless settling in
eastern Kurope and central Asia.

It may hence be safely assumed that as Africa now contains several
specie of zebras, Europe at the beginning of the Pleistocene period

yas inhabited by several species of horses.

We know that before the beginning of the historic age horses had
become extinct in North America, but we have not yet ascertained
what was the fate of the equine species which reached, or were evolved
in, the Old World before or during the great Ice age. It is believed
by some paleontologists that the Indian species, #’. sévalensés and
FE. namadicus, became extinct, and that Z’. stenonis gave rise through
one variety (7. robustus) to the modern domestic breeds, and by
another (Z’. ligeris) to the Burchell group of zebras. 2’. s¢valensis,
unlike /. stenonis, but like the still earlier three-toed horse Hipparion
and certain prehistoric South American species, was characterized
by a depression in front of the orbit for a facial gland (probably
similar to the scent gland of the stag), and usually by large first
premolar (wolf) teeth in the upper jaw. In some recent horses
having eastern blood in their veins there seems to be a vestige of the
preorbital depression, and in some of the horses of southeastern Asia
(e. g., Java and Sulu ponies), as in some zebras (e. g., Grévy’s zebra
and a zebra of the Burchell type found near Lake Baringo), there
are large functional first premolars. It is hence possible that lineal
but somewhat modified descendants of /#. stvalensis of the Indian
Pliocene may still survive, and that 2. stvalensis was a lineal descend-
ant of Hipparion.

We are, however, more concerned with the ancestors of the domestic
horses of Europe and North Africa than with oriental horses.

From osseous remains already found we know horses were widely
distributed over Europe during the Pleistocene period, and that they
were especially abundant in the south of France in post-Glacial times.
It has not yet, however, been determined how many species of horses
inhabited Europe during and immediately after the Ice age, nor yet
to which of the pre-Glacial species prehistoric horses were genetically
related. Bones and teeth from deposits and caves in the south of
THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONTES. 439

England seem to indicate that during the Pleistocene period several
species of horses ranged over the west of Europe. The Pleistocene
beds of Essex have yielded bones and teeth of a large-headed, heavily
built horse, which probably sometimes measured more than 14 hands
(56 inches) at the withers. From the * elephant bed” at Brighton
portions of a slender-limbed horse have been recovered, and Kent’s
Cave, near Torquay, has yielded numerous fragments of two varieties
or species which differed somewhat from the Essex and Brighton
species. The “elephant-bed ~ horse has hitherto been described as
very small, but if one is to judge by the bones in the British Museum
it may very well have reached a height of 50 or even 52 inches (122
or 13 hands). The Kent’s Cave horses were probably from 18 to 14
hands high. One in its build approached the Essex horse, the other
the slender-limbed species of the “elephant bed” at Brighton. If
there were two or more species in Pleistocene times in the south of
England (then part of the Continent), it is probable that yet other
species inhabited south and middle Europe and the north of Africa.

As already mentioned, horses were extremely abundant in the
south of France in the not very remote post-Glacial period.2 Evi-
dence of the existence of large herds we have at Solutré, where for
a number of years there was an open-air Paleolithic encampment.
Near the Solutré encampment (which hes in the vicinity of the
Sadne, about midway between Chalons and Lyon), the bones of
horses” and other beasts of the chase were sufficiently abundant to
form a sort of rampart around part of the settlement. It is difficult
to say how many species of horses are represented at Solutré, but
there seems no doubt that the majority belonged to a stout, long-
headed, but short-limbed animal, measuring about 54 inches (13.2
hands) at the withers. Though of smaller size, the typical Solutré
horse had nearly as large joints and hoofs as the Essex Pleistocene
species. Like the Essex horse, it seems to have been specially adapted
for living in low-lying, marshy ground in the vicinity of forests,
and for feeding during part of the vear on coarse grasses, shrubs,
roots, and other hard substances, for the crushing of which large
teeth, set in long powerful jaws, were indispensable.

That lightly built as well as stout species existed in post-Glacial
as in Pleistocene times is made evident by bones found in caves and
by drawings and sculptures made by Paleolithic hunters. Of the
existence of two kinds of horses in post-Glacial times, practically
identical with the stout and slender-limbed Pleistocene species, the
cave of Reilhac, near Lyon, is especially eloquent. It is, however,

historic Horses.’’)

in late Paleolithic times of various kinds
of light and heavy species of horses is
-made manifest.

In the cave of La Mouthe, e. g., two
horses are incised on the same panel—per-
haps by the same hand—one of which (fig.
1) has a very long head attached nearly
at right angles to a short, thick neck,
while the other has a small head, Arab-
like ears, and a long, slender neck, such as
we are wont to associate with race horses.

In the Combarelles cave (Commune of
Tayac), the walls of which for more than
100 yards are crowded with animal fig-
ures, there are, in addition to 23 nearly
full-sized engravings of horses, numerous

studies of equine heads.
Some of the Combarelles
horses decidedly differ
from those of La Mouthe.
There is, e. g., a large
drawing of a heavily built
horse (fig. 2) with a coarse
head, an arched muzzle,
a thick under lip, rounded
quarters, and a tail with
long hair up to the root.
At another part of the cave
there is what appears to be

derfully suggestive of an Arab, and at yet
another part of the cave a horse with a

stands an animal with a head like that of
a modern Shire horse.

In addition to the types figured on the
walls of caves, there are others carved on
pieces of horn and other durable substances.
The majority of the horses engraved on
horn are characterized by a very large
coarse head, but a few (e. g., the horse from
Schaffhausen) are remarkable for the small

size of the head, the fine muzzle, and small ears.
THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES. 441

As already indicated, the men of the early stone age have left us
drawings of some four or five different kinds of horses, some with
large heads and stout limbs, some with fine heads and slender limbs,
some with nearly straight croup and a well-set-on tail, others with
rounded quarters and the root of the tail far below the level of the
croup. Drawings made at the present day will be of little use some
centuries hence in providing an answer to the question, How many
species of horses existed in Europe at the beginning of the twentieth
century? They will confuse rather than enlighten future inquirers,
because for several generations breeders of horses, like breeders of
rattle and dogs, have with the help of selection and isolation succeeded
in creating humerous artificial strains. Is there any reason for sup-
posing the evidence afforded by the prehistoric drawings is more valu-
able to us than recent drawings will be to our successors thousands of
years hence, should they desire to ascertain how many species of horses
Britons possessed at the end of the nineteenth century? That depends
on whether in Paleolithic times the horse was domesticated in Europe.

It is extremely probable that the men of the early stone age had
now and again tame horses, just as nowadays we have at times tame
zebras, but it is most unlikely that they had herds of horses which
they systematically bred and reared as stockmen now breed and rear
cattle.

That the domestication of the horse as now understood was not
attempted in Palseolithic times may be inferred from the fact that the
majority of the horses in the Solutré bone mounds were from five to
seven years old. Had horses been bred for food, as we nowadays
breed cattle, young individuals would have been most abundant at
Solutré.

If it is admitted that the engravings on the walls of caves and on
pieces of horn fairly accurately represent animals which actually
existed at the end of the ice age, and if it is also admitted that the
creation of new varieties by artificial selection was never attempted
until at the earliest the arrival of the Neoliths, it follows that in post-
Glacial as in Pleistocene times there were several perfectly distinct
wild species of horses in Europe.

For some reason or other it has hitherto been very commonly
assumed that, as in recent times the wild striped horses of South
Africa—the quagga and zebras—have been gradually supplanted
by occidental 6r oriental domesticated horses, the wild horses of
Europe were gradually displaced by domesticated varieties intro-
duced by the Neoliths. It seems to me quite unnecessary to assume
that the indigenous varieties so long familiar to the Paleolithic
inhabitants were exterminated,

of indigenous varities, in all probability meant the introduction of
vet other varieties.

I may here repeat that now, as throughout the nineteenth century,
it is generally assumed that all the domestic breeds—small as well as
large-—have sprung from a single wild species. The great French
naturalist Cuvier believed not only that all living horses belonged
to one species (the Hquus caballus of Linnzus), but also that there
was no specific difference between living breeds and the fossil horses
of the Pleistocene period, Professor Sanson, of the French National
College of Agriculture, in his Traité de Zootechnie (1901), assuming
a ica origin for domestic breeds, divides recent horses into two
. long-headed and a short-headed group each of which
consists of several races, while Captain Hayes, in his recently pub-
lished Points of the Horse (1904), says, ‘* no breed of horses possesses
any distinctive characteristic which serves to distinguish it from
other breeds,” and adds that “as a rule locality * * * and arti-
ficial selection are the chief factors in the formation of breeds.”
Elséwhere Captain Hayes states: “As far as I can learn, no attempt
has been made to separate ponies from horses except on the purely
artificial basis of height.” Even those who are prepared to admit
that recent horses may have sprung from several wild species allege
that, owing to domestication, intercrossing, and artificial selection,
it is no longer possible to indicate the distinguishing characters of
the two or more wild species which took part in forming the present
races and breeds.

THE WILD HORSE (/’quus caballus prjevalskii) .

The wild horse may be first considered. For many years the
semiwild Tarpan of the Russian steppes was regarded as the nearest
living relative of the wild ancestor of the domestic breeds, but in
1881 the existence of a true wild horse was announced by the Russian
naturalist Polyakov. This horse occurs in the vicinity of the Gobi
Desert and the Great Altai Mountains, one variety living to the
southeast, another to the west, and a third to the south ae Kobdo.
All three varieties are of a yellow-dun color, the southeastern (Zagan-
Nor) form being especially characterized by a dark muzzle, dark
points, and a dark mane and tail; in the western (Urungu) variety
the muzzle is nearly white, the limbs are light down to the fetlocks,
and the mane and tail are of a reddish-brown tint, the southern
(Altai) form being nearly intermediate in its coloration. The
markings consist of a narrow dorsal band, faint indications of shoul-
der stripes, anid indistinct bars in the region of the knees and hocks.

a@Points of the Horse, pp. 422-425.
THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES. 443

In all three varieties the mane is short and upright in the autumn,
but long enough in spring toarch to one side of the neck; in summer
the upper two-thirds‘of the dock of the tail carries short hair, the
distal third long hair, which continues to grow until it reaches the
ground; in winter the upper two-thirds of the tail carries hair from
2 to 4 inches in length. The hair of the body and limbs is short in
summer, but under the jaw and over the greater part of the body
and limbs it is from 3 to 4 inches in length in winter.

The hoofs are narrower and have longer * heels” than in the com-
mon horse, but, as in the common horse, each mb is provided with
a chestnut and with an ergot, the hind chestnut (hock callosity)
being very long and narrow.

In the variety (fig. 1, pl. 1) occurring in the Altai south of Kobdo,
probably the most primitive of the three, the head is large and coarse,
and, compared with the length of the body, longer than in any do-
mestic breed. In a side view it is noticed that the forehead is promi-
nent (bumpy), the lower part of the face straight or slightly con-
vex, the under lip long, and that the head forms nearly a right angle
with the short neck. The eyes are lateral in position, and appear
unusually close to the ears owing to the great length of the space
between the eye and the nostril. The ears are long and generally
project obliquely outward (fig. 1, pl. 1), as im many cart horses. The
croup is nearly level, but the hocks are usually bent and turned in.
Judging by the behavior during the last two years of the wild horse
in my possession, I am inclined to think his less remote ancestors,
though in all probability members of the steppe fatina, lived for a
time (perhaps during the Ice age) in the vicinity of forests. As is
the case with other gregarious animals, he strongly objects to be
separated from his companions, and he also objects to have his
movements circumscribed by fences. It has often been said “ nothing
jumps better than a cart colt.” The cart colt Jumps because he
has sprung from big-jointed, broad-hoofed, forest-haunting ances-
tors whose existence often depended on their being able at a bound
to clear fallen trees and other obstacles. The wild horse when shut
up in a loose box by himself is very restless, and keeps rearing up
against the door until set at liberty; if placed in a paddock away
from his special comrades he generally succeeds in either scrambling
over or breaking down the fence.

The wild horse never encounters fences in the Gobi Desert, but,
probably because he had forest-bred ancestors which had often to
eross fallen trees, he endeavors without a moment’s hesitation to
clear all obstacles that come in his way, while true desert forms
endeavor to break through them.

It has been suggested that the wild horse of the Gobi Desert is
not a true wild animal, but only a domesticated breed that has re-
444 THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONITES.

verted to the wild state.* Against this view I may mention (1) that
all the wild horses are of a yellow-dun color, and that, though those
to the west of Kobdo differ in tint from those to the east, the eastern
and western varieties seem to be connected by the less specialized
variety to the south of Kobdo; (2) that travelers in Central Asia
all agree in stating that the Mongolian ponies vary greatly in color—
in a Chinese hymn known as the “ Emperor’s Horses” as many as
thirteen colors are referred to; (3) the descendants of the horses
which escaped from the Spaniards in America after several centu-
ries of freedom were of all sorts of colors; and (4) in horses which
live in subarctic areas the hair at the root of the tail tends to increase
so as to form a sort of tail lock, which when caked with snow pro-
tects the hind quarters during snowstorms; the complete absence of
this tail lock—fairly well developed in one of my Mongolian
ponies—is a very strong argument against the assumption that
Prjevalsky’s horse is nothing more than a domesticated breed that
has reverted to the wild state.

The wild horse of the Gobi Desert is certainly the least specialized
of all the horses living at the present day. In being of a yellow-dun
color, in shedding annually the hair of the mane and the hair from
the upper two-thirds of the tail, in having ergots and chestnuts on
the hind as well as on the fore limbs, and in having canines and
fairly large upper first premolars, Prjevalsky’s horse is distinctly
primeval. Only in the all but complete absence of stripes and in
having very long powerful jaws armed with relatively large teeth
‘an the Gobi horse be said to be specialized. :

It is extremely probable that Prjevalsky’s horse was familiar to the
troglodytes who inhabited the Rhone Valley in prehistoric times.
One might even go further and say that in fig. 1, from an engraving
in the cave of La Mouthe, we have a fairly accurate representation
of the head of Prjevalsky’s horse.

Tt is, of course, impossible to say which of the recent breeds are
most intimately related to the Gobi horse. Though the head and
ears are suggestive of some of the heavier occidental breeds, in its
trunk and limbs it more closely resembles Mongolian and Korean
horses, some of which, like Prjevalsky’s horse, decidedly differ from
Shires and Clydesdales in having a small girth owing to a want of
depth of body. To which domestic breeds the wild horse has con-
tributed characters which will probably become more manifest after
he has lived for some time under domestication. That heavy occi-
dental breeds are not pure descendants of Prjevalsky’s horse is sug-

a{t was formerly stated that the wild horse was simply a hybrid between a
Mongolian pony and a kiang. I recently showed that a hybrid of this kind is
quite different from the wild horse. See Proc. Roy. Soe. Edin., Vol. XXIV,
part y, 1902-3, and Nature, Vol. LX VIII, p. 271.

gested by the fact that cart horses, like zebras, have usually six
lumbar vertebre—the Wild horse of Asia has only five, like the wild
asses.

THE CELTIC PONY (A’quus caballus celticus).

From the most primitive member of the Equide family I shall turn
to the most specialized, viz, to what I have ventured to call the Celtic
pony.

In color and markings a typical Celtic pony only differs from the
intermediate (Altai) variety of the wild horse in having a slightly
darker muzzle, a less distinct ight ring around the eye, and a more
distinct dorsal band. The hair is similar in structure, but shghtly
longer in the Celtic pony during winter (fig. 2, pl. 1), more espe-
cially under the jaw—where it forms the so-called beard—over the
hind quarters, and on the legs. In the mane, tail, and callosities the
Celtic pony is very different from the wild Gobi horse. The mane is
made up of a mesial portion (nearly twice the width of the entire
mane in an Arab) consisting of strong dark hair, and of two lateral
portions the hair of which is lighter and finer and less circular in
section than the hair of the central portion. The mane in the adult
grows at the rate of from 9 to 10 inches per annum, and as only about
one-third of the hair is shed annually, the mane reaches a consid-
erable length. Owing to the great width of the middle portion the
one-half of the mane generally falls to the right side, the other to the
left. The front part of the mane hangs down over the face to form
a forelock (fig. 2, pl. 1).

The most remarkable feature of the Celtic pony is the tail. To
begin with, the dock is relatively very short—so short that one is apt
to suppose it has been docked. The distal two-thirds of the dock
varries long dark hairs, the majority of which continue to grow until
they trail on the ground. During winter and spring the proximal
third of the dock (about 4 inches) carries stiff hair from 3 to 6 inches
in length, which forms what may be known as a caudal fringe or tail
lock (fig. 2, pl. 1 and fig. 1, pl. 11). In the case of Arabs and other
semitropical horses, the first 1 or 2 inches of the dock are usually cov-
ered with short, fine hair like that over the hind quarters, but in the
Celtic pony fine, wiry hairs from 4 to 5 inches in length extend right
up to the root of the dock under cover of the body hair of the croup.
The most distal hairs of the tail lock overlap, but are quite distinct
from, the long persistent hairs carried by the lower two-thirds of the
dock. The hair in the center of the fringe, of the same color as the
dorsal band (fig. 1, pl. 1), projects obliquely backward; the hair at
the sides is light in color and projects obliquely outward. The pres-
ence of this very remarkable bunch of hair at the root of the tail was
quite incomprehensible until I noticed what happened during a snow-
446 THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES.

storm. The moment the storm set in the pony orientated herself so
that the snow was driven against her hind quarters. In a few min-
utes the lock of hair was spread out to form a disk, to which the snow
adhered, and thus provided a shield which effectually prevented the
flakes finding their way around the root of the tail, where they would
have soon melted and effectively chilled the thinly clad inner surface
of the thighs. Provided with a caudal shield, long, thick hair over the
hind quarters and back, and a thick mane covering both sides of the
neck and protecting the small ears, a Celtic pony is practically snow
proof. While the storm lasted the pony in question stood perfectly
still, with her head somewhat lowered, save when she shifted her posi-
tion as the wind veered from northwest to north. Very different was
the behavior of an Arab and a thoroughbred Highland colt close by.
After trying various attitudes the Arab, carrying her head low and to
one side, made a rush for the shelter of an adjacent wood; the half-
bred colt—prevented by her Celtic blood from running away—tried
in vain one position after another, and long before the storm ceased
looked thoroughly miserable and began to shiver as if chilled to the
bone. It hence follows that the tail lock is not, as I at first assumed,
an inheritance from a primitive ancestor akin to the wild horse, but
a highly specialized structure which eminently adapts the Celtic pony
for a subaretic environment. I need hardly say the caudal fringe is
not a product of artifical selection, for even in Iceland, where it reaches
its maximum development, neither its existence nor its use has, so far
as I can gather, ever been referred to. It need only be added that to
maintain a tail lock of this kind it is necessary that the short, wiry
hairs of which it consists must be renewed once a year.

In separating asses and zebras from horses, stress has hitherto
been laid on the difference in the mane and tail, and especially on
the absence of hind chestnuts. As already pointed out, the wild
horse during summer in its mane and tail agrees with asses and
zebras. The mane and tail are hence no longer of specific impor-
tance. This is also true of the chestnuts, for in the Celtic pony,
as in asses and zebras, the hind chestnuts (hock callosities) are com-
pletely absent. In the wild horse, as in the vast majority of heavy
and cross-bred horses, the hind chestnuts reach a considerable size,
but in asses and zebras and the Celtic pony I have failed to find any
rudiments of hind chestnuts, either before or after birth. Further,
in the Celtic pony the front chestnuts are small, and, still more
remarkable, the fetlock callosities (ergots) have entirely vanished ;
in asses and zebras the ergots are always present, and in some cases
still play the part of pads. The Celtic pony is hence not only more
specialized-—further removed from the primitive type—in its mane
and tail, but also in having lost the fetlock pads (ergots) and the
hock (heel) callosities. Nature makes little effort to get rid of use-
THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONTES. 447

less vestiges, so long as they are harmless. When an ergot or a
chestnut is accidentally torn off there is considerable loss of blood.
It is conceivable that in the remote past horses which happened to
be born without ergots proved better adapted for a life in the sub-
arctic regions—were Jess likely to suffer from injury when moving
through frozen snow and to become a prey to wolves—and_ hence
had a better chance of surviving and leaving descendants.

There is also evidence of specialization in the teeth of the Celtic
peny. In many horses—e. @., the horses of southeastern Asia—the
canines and upper first premolars (wolf teeth) are well developed,
but in the Celtic pony the first premolars seem to be invariably
absent, while the canines are either absent or very minute, even in
old males. In all the typical Celtic ponies IT have seen the head is
small, Arab like in outline, and well put on to a relatively long neck;
the muzzle is fine and shghtly arched, the under lip short and well
molded, the nostrils are wide, and the eyes on a level with the fore-

head, while the ears are short, white tipped, and carried as a rule in
an upright position. Owing to the shortness of the jaws the pro-
portion of the head to the body is as 1 to 2.50 instead of 1 to 2.20,
as in the wild horse.

Except in size I have been unable to discover any difference be-
tween the skeleton and teeth of the Celtic pony and those of the small
horse of the “elephant bed” of the Brighton Pleistocence. In the
most northern part of Iceland, where the few pure specimens of the
Celtic pony survive, only a height of 12 hands (48 inches) is
reached. Under more favorable conditions the height would prob-
ably be 50 or 52 inches, the size of some of the “elephant bed”
horses and of the smaller variety of the desert-bred Arab, to which
the small, slender-limbed occidental pony closely approximates.

In temperament the Celtic pony is very different from the wild
horse. Captain Hayes had no difficulty in handling the wild horse
in my possession, but from first to last, though giving evidence of
marked intelligence, it was absolutely irresponsive and spiritless.
A Celtic pony, on the other hand, rapidly learns what the trainer
wishes and responds with alacrity. In its keenness and speed, stay-
ing power and agility, a pure Celtic pony is as different from an
ordinary heavy-headed Iceland pony (i. e., a dwarf horse) as an
Arab is from a cari horse.

The question may now be asked, is my most typicai Celtic pony a
pure or nearly pure specimen of a once widely distributed wild
species, or is it at most an approximation to an ideal type living

a}f, as it seems likely, the absence of ergots (i. e., of spurs in the center of
the footlocks) is an advantage in arid regions, such as the Libyan Plateau,
we can understand their freyuent absence in Barbs and Arabs.
448 THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES.

representatives of which no longer exist? I regard the pony de-
seribed above as an almost pure representative of a once widely dis-
tributed wild species, for the following reasons: (1) In its color and
markings it is almost identical with Prjevalsky’s horse, and not
unlike some of the varieties of the wild Asiatic ass. (2) The hind
chestnuts and all four ergots are completely absent. (3) The tail lock
is perfectly adapted for its work—were the hairs shorter the fringe
would be ineffective, were they longer the snow shield, if ever formed,
would rapidly disintergate. (4) The first premolars are completely
absent, and only one of the four canines is represented, and that only
by a minute peg which barely projects beyond the gum. (5) The
pony in question proved sterile with stallions belonging to five dif-
ferent breeds, as well as with a Burchell zebra and a kiang; but she
at once bred when mated with a yellow-dun Connemara-Welsh pony,
which closely approximates to the Celtic type. (6) Ponies having
the more striking Celtic characteristics occur 1n isolated and outlying
areas, where one would expect to find remnants of an ancient highly
specialized species which perchance reached the Old World from the
New in pre-Glacial times or during warm inter-Glacial periods—in,
e. g., Iceland (which has been almost completely isolated since the
twelfth or thirteenth century), the Faroe Islands, Shetland, the
Hebrides, the west of Ireland, and Finland.

Flat-nosed variety of the Celtic pony.—tIn the Faroes, the Hebrides,
and in Shetland there are slender-limbed ponies which, except in
their color and the shape of the head, and in some cases the form of
the hind quarters, closely agree with my typical Celtic pony. In
these ponies the depression below the eyes is more pronounced, and
extends well-nigh to the muzzle, which is nearly flat. The nostrils
look downward, and the space between them, instead of being arched,
as in the Iceland specimen, is flat, and forms nearly a right angle
with the face.

Some of these flat-nosed ponies are of a foxy red color, others are
dark brown. According to Landt, the majority of the Faroe ponies
a century ago were foxy red—the St. Kilda ponies, 18 in all, seen by
Martin at the end of the seventeenth century, were also of a red
color—the others were with few exceptions dark. A foxy red Faroe
pony in my possession has neither dorsal band nor bars on the leg,
but it has a light mane and tail, a nearly straight croup, and well
formed hind quarters. All the other foxy red Faroe ponies I have
seen or heard of closely resemble the one in my collection.

The dark Faroe ponies, like the dark Barra ponies, only differ from
the foxy red ponies in not having in every case a straight croup and
a high set-on tail, while the dark variety of the Celtic pony found in
Shetland is in build more like the typical Iceland specimens than the
Faroe variety.
THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES. 449

Herodotus (v. q.) says of the horses of the Sigynnze—the only tribe
he knew the name of across the Danube—they “are shaggy all over
the body, to 5 fingers in depth of hair; they are small, flat-nosed, and
unable to carry men; but when yoked to chariots they are very fleet,
therefore the natives drive chariots.” This description, so far as it
goes, is singularly accurate of the foxy red Faroe ponies, even to
their being very fleet “ when yoked to chariots.” It is extremely
probable that in the red colored Faroe ponies we have a remnant of a
very old and once widely distributed variety, the orign of which is
never likely to be revealed. I’or some unaccountable reason the silver
mane and tail are as a rule either handed on untarnished to cross-bred
offspring or they reappear in the second or one of the subsequent
generations. It is hence possible that various large breeds—such as
the Suffolk Punch, the white-maned horses of the Hebrides and of the
north and west of Ireland, certain silver-maned Hungarian and
Russian races, not to mention Chittabob and other English thorough-
breds—have all inherited their ight manes and tails from an ancient
foxy red variety of the Celtic pony.

The origin of the dark-brown variety of the Celtic pony is also
wrapped in mystery. These dark-brown ponies may represent
another old variety from which the Exmoors have sprung—a variety
which has contributed the tan-colored muzzle and the ring round
the eye so characteristic of many of the best Highland and Island gar-
rons. One of these dark-brown ponies, brought from Barra as a 2-
year-old, looked for a time like a miniature thoroughbred. Now as a
3-year-old it might pass for one of the oldest and best type of the dark
Feroe ponies. Neither the dark nor the red Faroe ponies ever
possess all the Celtic characteristics; at the most they are three parts
pure, and I may add they cross freely with Norwegian and other
breeds, generally transmitting such Celtic “ points” as they possess
to their mixed offspring.“ It is worthy of note that in some of the
small-headed horses engraved in the Combarelles and other caves
inhabited in Paleolithic times the croup is straight and the tail set
on high, as in many Arabs; in others the tail, instead of being in a
line with the croup, looks as if it had been an afterthought—an
appendage inserted fairly well up in some cases, lower down in

others, as is the case in many large and small horses with rounded
quarters. In the engravings showing a small-headed horse with a
straight croup we seem to have the foxy-red variety represented; in
ae with somewhat drooping quarters we may have a representation
of the dark-brown variety of the Celtic pony.
If one may judge from its specialization and from its being now
adapted for sub-Arctic conditions, the Celtic pony belongs to a

450 THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES.

variety which at a very remote period branched off from the main
stem and possibly reached Europe and north Africa long before
the advent of the Neoliths, to become the progenitors not only of
occidental, but also of African races.¢

As might have been anticipated, Celtic characters can often be
identified in British and other occidental breeds. Many thorough-
breds, which are an unequal blend of Barbs and of Arabs in which
eastern races often prevail, and of light and heavy occidental vari-
eties, show traces of Celtic ancestors. Many small thoroughbreds
“ride like a pony,” or have a pony head, or pony legs, some even want
the ergots or hind chestnuts, or the tail has a vestige of a fringe, or
there is the gait and temperament, alertness, and intelligence of the
pony. Many of the Highland garrons have pony characteristics,
and this is also true of all the old mountain and moorland breeds,
more especially of the mealy-nosed Exmoor ponies and some of the
better bred dun-colored Connemaras.

Even in Clydesdales of the older type pony characters sometimes
surge to the surface, while in crossbred animals they sometimes pre-
dominate. Recently I heard of a powerful, active 17-hand horse,
with a wonderful reputation for speed, strength, and staying power,
in which the hind chestnuts, greatly to the surprise of the owner,
were completely absent. On making inquiries as to the pedigree of
this horse I ascertained he was bred in Caithness and was the grand-
son of a Highland pony.

THE NORSE HORSE (Hquus caballus typicus).

During prehistoric times in certain parts of Europe a tundra fauna
gave place to a steppe fauna, which later was succeeded by a forest
fauna. Evidence of this succession we especially have in the rock
shelter at Schweizersbild, near Schaffhausen. In the lower deposits
the remains of the reindeer, musk ox, variable hare, Arctic fox, and
other tundra forms occurred. Nearer the surface were relics of ham-
sters, the woolly rhinoceros, kiang, horse, and other denizens of the
steppes; and on still higher layers the bones of the beaver, hare, and

aThat the Celtic pony is akin to the smaller high-caste Arabs has already
heen hinted. The only fundamental difference, apart from the coat, main, and
tail, between many small Arabs and a Celtic pony is in the ears; in the Arab
they are long and often incurved at the points. The long ears of the Arab may
either be due to eastern blood of the Kattiawar kind or to long ears being an
advantage to the wild ancestors that frequented the great Libyan plateau, as
long ears are of advantage to the mountain zebra and to the kangaroo of the
Australian bush. About the origin of the large varieties of Arabs provided with
ergots, with hind chestnuts like those of Prjevalsky’s horse, a somewhat long
head, a tendency to a Roman nose, large joints, and a circumference of 74 to 8
inches below the knee, I am unable to offer an opinion.
THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES. ie

squirrel, the badger, pine martin, and wild boar, the stag, roedeer,
urus, horse, and other recognized members of a true forest fauna.

Tn the case of the Equidee it is often extremely difficult to determine
to which species any given bones belong, and hence it is impossible to
state definitely that the horses found along with the hamsters and
other steppe forms essentially differed from those which were con-
temporaries of the stag and wild boar and other typical forest forms.

It may, however, be assumed that even in post-Glacial times the
majority of the inhabitants of the steppes would when mature be
quite or nearly whole colored, while frequenters of the forests would
as often be either striped or spotted; that, e. ¢., the horse which fre-
_quented the Rhine valley along with the kiang and woolly rhinoceros
would resemble the wild horse (2. ¢. prjevalskii) which, with the
kiang, now lives in the vicinity of the Great Altai Mountains, while
the horse which at a subsequent period was a contemporary of the
wild boar, stag, and roedeer would be more or less richly striped, and
in its limbs and general conformation adapted for a life in or near
forests.

That there is some ground for this assumption will, I think, be
admitted when due consideration is given to results obtained by cross-
ing various kinds of horses with a Burchell zebra. When ponies of
the Celtic type—i. e., ponies which in their color are identical with
Prjevalsky’s horse, almost certainly the lineal descendant of the
steppe horse of Paleolithic times—are crossed with a male Burchell
zebra, hybrids are obtained which, while in build strongly suggesting
a Burchell zebra, are as profusely striped as the great zebra of Soma-
liland, and have at least five times as many transverse stripes across
the trunk as occur in their zebra sire. When, however, pony mares of
the Norwegian type are crossed with a Burchell zebra the hybrids
resemble in make their Norse dams, and in their markings closely
approximate the common or mountain zebra. The explanation of
these remarkable differences seems to be that in the case of the Celtic
pony hybrids the remote (Grévy like) ancestors of the Burchell zebra
control the development and determine the plan of the decoration,
while in the case of the Norse pony hybrids the remote striped-horse
ancestors contribute the more obvious characters—the Norse ponies
having more influence in determining the plan of striping than the
highly specialized Celtic ponies, from which stripes had probably all
but completely disappeared countless generations before they began
to fade on the horses which belonged to the forest fauna.

It is probable that the highly specialized Celtic pony, as well as
the primitive Gobi wild horse, belong to the steppe fauna, and it is
equally probable that the yellow-dun (Fjord) horse, in which a
striped coat may be said to be latent, belongs to the forest fauna. If
this be admitted, it follows that the environment of the Norse race has

452 THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES.

been for untold ages so different from that of the Celtic pony and the
wild horse that it centuries ago acquired the rank of a distinct species,
or at least a well-marked natural variety.

The question now arises: Does there exist in any of the outlying
parts of the world (where artificial selection has been made use of to
conserve old rather than to create new types) horses of a red rather
than of a yellow-dun color—more like the red deer than the kiane—
horses with a sufficient number of imperfect stripes on the body and
bars on the legs to indicate descent from ancestors decorated after the
manner of the mountain zebra? As is now generally known, dun-
colored horses with remnants of a striped coat now and again make
their appearance in all parts of both the old and new worlds. It is
also a matter of common knowledge that dark yellow-dun horses,
sometimes with fragments of numerous stripes, are always to be met
with in, among other places, Mongoha, Tibet, the northwest provinces
of India (especially in the State of Kattiawar), and in the northwest
of Europe, more especially in Norway, the Highlands and islands of
Scotland, and in Iceland. With the exception of the Kattiawars,
which, probably as the result of rigid selection, stand apart, all the
others have many points in common—some of the dun Mongol ponies
agreeing closely with Norwegians; but they all—the Kattiawars more
than the rest—decidedly differ from 2’. ¢. prjevalskii, the wild horse
of the Great Altai Mountains, and from typical specimens of the light
yellow-dun Celtic pony.

The most richly striped horses I have hitherto come across occur
in the northwest of Scotland. One of these recently examined is
alike in make, color, and markings so unique, and looks so little
modified by domestication and artificial selection, that 1t must, I
think, be considered as a fairly typical specimen of a once wild
species. The history of the yellow-dun striped race, to which the
specimen alluded to belongs, has not yet been written, but there is
little doubt that it was introduced into Scotland from Scandinavia
about the end of the eleventh or beginning of the twelfth century.
As this yellow-dun striped race may very well have been familiar to
Linneeus, it may, I think, be taken as the type of the large occidental
breeds, and known as the Hquus caballus typicus.. A typical speci-
men of the Norse variety is of a dark yellow-dun color, with black
“points ” and a nearly black mane and tail. The mane is long and
heavy and tends to fall to both sides of the neck, as in the Celtic
pony. Only a few hairs at the root of the tail are shed in summer,
and there is no attempt to form a tail lock in winter, while the fet-
locks, never very long, are limited to the region of the ergots. The
forehead is decorated with narrow stripes, which in their number
and arrangement agree more with the mountain than with the true
Burchell zebra. A broad dorsal band extends along the back to lose
THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONTES. 453

itself in the tail; there are stripes on the neck and faint stripes ex-
tend a short distance from the dorsal band across the body, as in the
British Museum quagga, while the legs, especially in the region of the
“knees ” and hocks, are marked by distinct bars.

The ears are short and are carried in a nearly upright position;
the forehead (which is not particularly wide), in having two ridges
extending upward from the prominent eyes to meet under the fore-
lock, ditfers greatly from the “bumpy” forehead of Prjevalsky’s
horse and the flat forehead of the Celtic pony. The space between
the orbit and the nostril is relatively longer than in the Celtic pony,
but shorter than in Prjevalsky’s horse. The eyes project beyond the
level of the forehead. In the Celtic pony the eyes are large and
adapted for a wide range; in the wild horse they are some distance
from the front of the head; in the Norse horse they are small and
look downward rather than forward. The outline of the face be-
comes convex above the muzzle and ends in a somewhat long upper
lip, adapted, like the upper lip in the giraffe, for feeding on leaves
and twigs. In the neck and shoulders, trunk and limbs, the Norse
variety may be said to resemble a small cart horse of the Suffolk type.

Compared with the wild horse, the withers are lower and the hind
quarters more rounded, and the tail springs more abruptly and at a
lower level, and hence fails to convey the impression that it is a
direct continuation of the trunk. The dock is relatively longer than
in the Celtic pony, but shorter than in the wild horse. The limbs are
short, but the joints are large and the hoofs fairly broad; hence in a
side view of the foreleg a considerable increase is noticed as the
thick fetlock joint is reached.

It will be evident from what has been said that the Norse horse
differs chiefly from the wild Gobi horse in being of a darker dun
color, in being far more richly striped, in the shape of the head, size
of the ears, position of the eyes, and also in the muzzle, mane, tail,
hind quarters, joints, and hoofs. From the Celtic pony the Norse
horse also differs in the color and markings; but it especially differs
in the tail and in the greater proportional length of the distance be-
tween the eye and the nostril, and in having a complete set of ergots
and chestnuts. It is inconceivable that the Norse variety could revert
to the Prjevalsky horse type, or be regarded as an offshoot from the
Celtic pony.

The question may now be asked, Is there any evidence that the
Paleoliths of the south of Europe were familiar with horses of the
Norse type? Figure 2, plate 11, gives an imperfect idea of a specimen
of the Norse race from the west of Ross-shire. If this figure of a
horse still living is compared with figure 2, which faithfully repro-
duces an engraving made thousands of years ago in the Combarelles

.
454 THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES.

cave by one of the artist hunters of the early stone age, it will, I
thik, be admitted the Norse horse probably belongs to a very ancient
race.

I need only add that I regard the Norse race as the foundation of
what in the Highlands are known as “ garrons.” Horses of this type
may very well have been originally obtained by blending the old
indigenous yellow-dun striped race with Flemish and French breeds
imported direct from the Continent or introduced from England
during the middle ages. Further, it is extremely probable that the
Norse race took part in forming the small active Clydesdales of a
former generation.

OTHER OCCIDENTAL HORSES.

In addition to Oriental and African varieties, which doubtless
include several wild species amongst their ancestors, there are two
or more Occidental varieties which in various ways differ from the
Norse and Celtic races and from Prjevalsky’s horse.

One of the latter races include long, low, heavily built animals
with unusually long heads; another consists of short-bodied animals
with a large head and a pronounced Roman nose.

The long-headed variety which occurs in the Hebrides and the
Central Highlands reminds one of the horses engraved during the
stone age on a piece of reindeer horn. In one specimen of this
variety met with in Perthshire the profile is straight, and the dis-
tance from the orbit to the nostril is 18 inches, 1. e., 2 inches more
than in a member of the Norse breed of a like size, and 4 inches
longer than in a 14-hands Connemara pony allied to the Celtic race.
Some of these long-headed forms with a straight profile and a well-
molded muzzle resemble the horses of the Parthenon.

Horses with a pronounced Roman nose also occur in the western
islands and Highlands of Scotland, and in Ireland, Austria, America,
and other parts of the world into which breeds were introduced from
Spain. One of this Roman-nosed type, of a yellow-dun color, met
with in the Outer Hebrides, was especially interesting. It very
decidedly differed from members of the Norse race in the same dis-
trict, but, on the other hand, it agreed in the outhne of the head with
some of the engravings in the Dordogne caves. It is hence conceivy-
able that the Roman-nosed variety (from which the modern Shire
breed may be an offshoot) is a very old one—a variety which was
firmly established centuries before domesticated breeds first made
their appearance in Europe.
THE MULTIPLE ORIGIN OF HORSES AND PONIES. 455

SUMMARY.

I have endeavored to indicate that in post-Glacial as in pre-Glacial
times there were several distinct species of horses, and that it is
extremely probable some of the prehistoric species and varieties have
persisted almost unaltered to the present day. I have shortly deseribed
three distinct kinds of living horses, viz, the wild horse of the Gobi
Desert (2. ¢. prejevalshii) ; the Celtic pony, which, though no longer
wild, may be known as the /. ¢. celticus; and the Norse horse, which
may very well stand as the type of one of the large Occidental breeds,
and be known as Zc. typicus. I have also pointed. out that in addi-
tion to these three very distinct types—two at least of which have
taken part in forming quite a number of our British breeds—we have
a long-headed, heavily built variety with a straight profile, and a
long-headed, heavily built variety with a more or less pronounced
Roman nose. I have also indicated that in addition to several Occi-
dental varieties there are several African and Oriental varieties, and
I might have added that, in so far as the English thoroughbred is a
mixture of African and Oriental varieties and of Occidental light
and heavy varieties, it might be cited as an excellent example of a
breed which includes amongst its ancestors several wild species—a
breed which has had a multiple origin.

EGYPTIAN AND ARABIAN HORSES.
By E. PrIsse b’AVENNES.

I.—Eayrrran Horsss.

Everyone knows that in spite of its admirable qualities the thor-
oughbred Arabian steed is rarely to be found on our stock farms.
Although many people well qualified to speak have written at length
upon the Arabian horses, there still remains a good deal to be said.
But amidst the absorbing interest attached to the breeding and rais-
ing of this noble animal we should not allow ourselves to forget the
Egyptian horse,

There has been much discussion as to the native land of the horse;
but no one has yet been able to prove with any degree of certainty
to what country we are indebted for this beautiful and useful quad-
ruped. Some writers, influenced no doubt by the renown of the civ-
ilization of ancient Egypt and struck by the military scenes sculp-
tured or painted on palaces—as at Thebes and Karnak—have
advanced the theory that the horse had its origin in the valley of the
Nile and was propagated throughout the Old World by the conquests
of the Pharaohs.

This assertion, allowed to go unchallenged and almost without
criticism, is refuted by every bit of evidence the Egyptian monu-
ments can furnish.

The history of the Egyptian people divides itself into three great
periods. The first is that of the primitive monarchy, from the
founder Menes to the extinction of the kings of the twelfth dynasty,
three thousand seven hundred and three years before the Christian
era. This is the epoch of the invasion of the shepherds or hyksos.?

The dominion of the Asiatic conquerors over Egypt forms the
second period. Their expulsion, about 1822 B. C., opened a new era
of prosperity under the Pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty and
marks the beginning of the third period.

On the monuments of the first of these periods, such as the hypogea
of Memphis, Beni-Hassen, Syout, and Kofim-el-Ahmar, the army is

shown to be made up entirely of foot soldiers and no trace of any
bas-rehef or painting representing horses, cavalry, or war chariots
is to be found on these monuments. ‘This tends very strongly to make
one believe that the horse was not known to the Egyptians before the
close of the twelfth dynasty, after the campaigns of Osortassin in
Asia. Without doubt it was with the invading shepherds that the
horse first made its appearance and became naturalized in the valley
of the Nile.

A searching study of these Pharonic palaces enables us to state
positively that there is not a single representation of a horse on any of
the Egyptian edifices erected before the invasion of the Hyksos.
Only after the overthrow, and more generally after the expulsion of
these Asiatic conquerors, do we find depicted on the Egyptian monu-
ments military scenes in which horses and war chariots play a con-
siderable part in determining the great changes in the tactics of the
Egyptian army. Moreover, the ancient historians, ike Herodotus,
Diodorus Siculus, and Strabo, are unanimous in omitting any mention
of the appearance of this noble animal prior to the epoch of the
Hyksos invasion.

Had the horse been indigenous to the valley of the Nile the early
Egyptians, who were accustomed to deify the more remarkable ani-
mals and plants of their country, would certainly not have neglected
to give to one of their gods the head of the hardy and spirited courser
who shared with man the dangers of the battlefield.

If they did not raise altars to him, as they did to so many sacred
beasts, it is only because they held in abhorrence the people to whom
the introduction of the beautiful animal was due.

Finally, if the first Egyptians did not institute sacrifices of horses,
like the assouame’ d’ ha ¢ of the Hindoos, it was because the flesh was
tabooed on account of the inveterate hatred that the customs of the
Hyksos had left among the earlier inhabitants of the land. Never-
theless, the Egyptians esteemed the horse too highly to employ him in
agriculture, and never, except in one little bas-relief on the temple of
Khons ? at Karnak, do we find horses harnessed to a plow.

After the expulsion of the Hyksos, about two thousand two hundred
years before the Christian era, the Egyptians began to give much
attention to the equine race, and the care they lavished upon their
breeding soon resulted in a great numerical increase.

aThe sacrifice of the horse, assouame’ d’ ha, is one of the oldest rites men-
tioned in the Hindoo books. It was considered very efficacious and always had
a place in the honoring of the Hindoo trinity.

In some other sacrifices—known as the balidaya—the Hindoos likewise offered
horses, but instead of burning the flesh on the altar, they presented it raw to
the gods.

It looks as though the ancient Egyptians early realized the bene-
ficial effects of crossbreeding, for among the conquered peoples who
paid tribute to Thoutmes TTI, of the NVITT dynasty, one thousand
eight hundred and twenty-two years before the Christian era, came
the envoys of an Adriatic race—probably Mesopotamia—who brought
* horses,” a chariot, etc. These imported animals were without doubt
intended for the improvement of the Egyptian race.

Judging from the bas-reliefs and paintings, the Egyptian horses
were tall, like the Nicwan horses of the plains of Media described by
Herodotus. They had slender tapering necks, well-rounded chest
and shoulders, high withers, long clean-cut legs, and long and plenti-
ful tails. The colors in which they are generally represented on the
monuments of the Nile Valley indicate that white, bright bay, and
piebald were the common colorings. These are, in brief, the details
furnished us by the Egyptian monuments of the time of the Pha-
raohs; the two accompanying figures give an exact idea of the curious
old representations.

This vigorous species is still preserved in the upper valley of the
Nile and is sometimes even found in Egypt where it is known as the
Donkolawi; that is to say, a native of the province of Donkola in
Nubia.¢

These Donkolain horses, which do not, we are told, thrive in cold
climates, are tall—5i or 6 feet in height—black, bright bay, or pie-
bald; the head is long and bushy, of the type common to the cows and
sheep of this country; the face is quite attractive and intelligent, the
shoulders well chiseled and round rather than square, the withers
high, the flanks large, the chest, as a rule, full and muscular, the legs
long and inclined to slimness, with white stockings on two or four
feet.

The Donkolain is deliberate in starting and must be put into his
paces gradually; then he has a brillant action, with movements agile,
nervous, and elastic. He is very steady, can stand a great deal of
fatigue, and shows much docility and affection for man.

However, the remarkable vigor which characterizes this horse in
his native country is lost 1f he remains for any length of time in
Lower Egypt. This degeneration, for which none can account, is so
evident that the Egyptian Government, after the organization of its
cavalry corps, was obliged to throw out of service all the Nubian
horses in its ranks.

The crossing of the Donkolawi with Nedjedian mares, as tried at
the Choubra stud near Cairo, produced very beautiful animals of very
little value. This experiment, made probably without forethought,
care, or sanitary precaution, could hardly be expected to give very

460 EGYPTIAN AND ARABIAN HORSES.

satisfactory results, and should not lead to the rejection of the Donk-
olain horse. Moreover, it is hardly to be expected that the best
results can be achieved in the first generation, but rather by dint of
continual interbreeding.

At present, as a matter of fact, the Egyptian horse is not a very
distinct species; they have been bred so at random that they do not
retain any of the characteristic forms or traits which would serve to
distinguish them permanently.

The modern Egyptian horse is below the medium size, but is
stocky and well filled out. Huis head is long, square, and ponderous,
his large ears are as a rule awkwardly placed, his eyes are little but
expressive, his nose is sloped off sharply and his nostrils flattened.
He has a full chest between a pair of heavy shoulders, which are
ordinarily square rather than rounded. His withers are not very
prominent. The rump is deeply cleft, the stomach large, the hams
and knees strong, the feet broad, the mane and tail coarse and
abundant.

Not infrequently these horses have their front legs disproportion-
ately short; their bodies are not always long enough for symmetry ;
and the head and hind quarters often resemble those of a mule. These
faults, however, are traceable to the Syrian type, a breed which has
contributed much to the composition of the modern Egyptian.
Bright bay, chestnut, and a dirty gray are the colors usually found;
white is not at all common, and, being the color of princes, is very
much sought after; black is the rarest of all.

The Egyptian horse is gentle, docile, and generally quite lively.
When excited his veins fill, his nostrils distend, his eyes shine; all
his movements are full of fire and vigor, but his strength is soon
exhausted.

The Egyptians show much consideration in the treatment of their
steeds, but the way they raise, feed, and pamper them is not calecu-
lated to produce a remarkable breed. On account of this care the
animals are too short winded to run any great distances.

The art of horse training is but comparatively little known among
the Egyptians. A colt, within a few days after birth, is allowed to
follow its mother on all excursions. The rider, however, is careful
to stop often, so that the youngster shall not suffer for nourishment.
Sick or well, the colt is weaned at the end of six or seven months,
and then they give him very little food until he is 2 years old.
Moreover, they take no pains about providing any transition from
ereen food to dry. These habits have most deplorable consequences
in underdeveloping and predisposing the animal to all kinds of
sickness.

Like his predecessors in the days of the Pharaohs, the modern
Egyptian does not use his horse for agriculture; he regards it as a
LGYPTIAN AND ARABIAN HORSES. 461

useful luxury and trains it with that idea only in mind. The pace
and the gallop are the only gaits that the Egyptians ever teach their
horses, and they haye hardly any tricks of the horse trainer. They are
generally broken in on a track or narrow place, where they can run
at full gallop so close to a wall that they must turn on their hind
legs as a pivot or, what is still more difficult, stop short on their front
ones. This practice, however, is not without its injurious effects on
the horses.

The ancient Egyptians did not shoe their steeds, which traveled
everywhere without any detriment to their hoofs. Shoes were not
at all necessary in Egypt and were not used except by the Turks, who
introduced the custom in the cities and army. Unshod horses are not
subject to foot diseases common among others.

As among the Arabs, signs, supposed to be lucky or otherwise.
determine the value of a horse. Little knots formed by the skin at
certain points are by far the most sought-for omens; next in impor-
tance come the stars on the forehead, then various other marks, and
finally the shade of color. The inhabitants of Egypt, like those of
Arabia and Turkey, esteem highly horses with three white feet.

All the luxuriousness of the Egyptian cavalier finds outlet in his
horse’s trappings, which are of a remarkable richness and beauty and
greatly resembling those used in Europe during the middle ages. The
saddles, equipped with high pommels, afford the rider a very secure
seat. The saddle bow is well adapted to the configuration of both
man and beast. In case of a fall the great stirrups aid in assuring
safety, and they are of great assistance to a rider when using his
weapons.

In order to correct various bad habits, such as biting, kicking, rear-
ing, the Egyptian employs methods much more efficacious than the
mere use of the sharp edges of his stirrups. When a horse bites they
proceed to irritate him and then present him with a bad leg of mutton
just from the fire. The pain that the animal experiences when he
seizes this seething viand makes him think twice before biting again.
The method of procedure with a rearing horse is equally simple. A
groom or a horse trainer, carrying in each hand a bardaque or heavy
water cooler full of cold water, accompanies his master. When the
horse begins to rear the rider seizes one of the porous jugs and breaks
it on the breast of his steed. The shock and the sensation of the cold
water soon checks any tendencies of that kind.

At one time the Pasha Mohammed-Ali sought to improve his race
of horses by establishing at Choubra a stock farm containing 450
mares from the finest herds of Nedjd and Syria. Under the super-
vision of a Frenchman this establishment was just beginning to meet
with remarkable success when it was turned over to a Turkish di-
rector. In:a very short time it met the fate of all European institu-

tions that have to struggle against the ignorance, prejudices, and
laziness of the Turks or native Egyptians. The stud of Ibrahim
Pasha contained nearly 400 Nedjdian and Aneza horses; those of the
Pashas Abbas and Kourchid were equally well filled with stallions
and mares from Arabia and Hauran. Such a provision should cer-
iainly have assured Egypt a remarkable race; but so little was the
method and care displayed in their administration and so great is the
ignorance of the Egyptians and Turks of everything which pertains
to the breeding and raising of horses that these establishments failed
utterly to accomplish anything worthy of note.

As a result the breed of Egyptian horses, which in the past was
famed for its virtues, is to-day nothing more than a mixture of all the
races brought into that country since the Arabian conquest. ‘These
foreign elements have modified the shape and size of the Egyptian
{ype to such an extent that the horse as we find him in no wise resem-
bles his ancestors depicted on the bas-rehefs of ancient Egypt. How-
aver, it is a perfectly safe conclusion that none can compare with the
thoroughbred Arabian—the only direct descendant of the pure-
blooded horse.

II].—Tur ArAsiaAn Horse anp His Principat Marks.

The scarcity of the pure-blooded Arabian horse in our studs is a
fact to be deplored, especially as this race must always be depended
upon to ameliorate the breed of our horses. But their scarcity, as
well as their value, will lend additional interest to a few details con-
cerning the origin and the introduction into France of this valuable
“ regenerator.”

The Arabian horse is par excellence the king of horses.’ In every
case where the blood is pure it presents the most perfect type, and in
every case of mixture its offspring show some remarkable qualties.
Almost alone it seems to have the faculty of improving the various
breeds with which it is crossed and of perpetuating through succes-
sive generations its characteristic traits. As everyone knows, Ara-
bian horses are wonderfully intelligent. Story after story is told
of their extraordinary affection and sagacity. Moreover, they pos-
sess other admirable qualities. More than any other horse an Arabian
can stand hunger, thirst, extreme fatigue, and bad weather. Conse-
quently he makes an ideal war horse.

The Arabian horse was acclimated in France about the time of the
first Crusades and is the foundation of our beautiful and powerful

races of Limousin, Brittany, Ardennes, Auvergne, and others almost
as well known. . -

The Romans valued most-highly as a war mount the Numidian
horse.¢ They used them with great success in their expeditions
against the Germans, the Gauls, and the Scythians. During the Cru-
sades the Frankish peoples brought home numbers of oriental horses,
which they soon came to value highly for breeding no less than for
war.

All the famous horses of history—that of Richard Careur de Lion
at Medina, of Philip Augustus at Bouvines, of William the Con-
queror at Hastings, of Saint Louis at Massoure, of Francis the First
at Pavia, of Henry the Second at the tournament in which he was
killed, of Henry the Fourth at Arques de Ivry, of Louis XIV in his
wars and fetes, and, finally, of Napoleon at Marengo and Austerlitz—
all these horses were “Arabians ” or * Barbs.”

The Arabian horse is easily recognized by a peculiar physiognomy.
He has always a remarkable expression which is not found in any
other race and which seems to signalize him as the type of the spe-
cies. His head is square and sharply chiseled; in front it is large and
sometimes bulgy; the back of the skull is also well developed. The
eyes are large, prominent, and ordinarily very beautiful, with the
characteristic black lashes. The ears are small, well placed, and
mobile. The lower jaw is a little strong; the forehead is hollow
rather than prominent; the muzzle is sharp; the nostrils large and
susceptible of great dilation when the horse is excited. The mouth
is of medium size, with a small lower lip. A well-attached head and
sasy curve of neck and shoulder give an elegance to the animal. The
neck is long enough to bend gracefully, and, when the horse runs,
is thrown back to form what is termed the ‘“ stag neck.” This con-
formation, looked upon somewhat as a fault, is natural to all animals

oe

who run long distances.

The withers of the Arabian are well filled out without being con-
spicuous; the back narrow, the sides rounded, the loins double and
full, the hind quarters long and rounded. A well-placed tail is car-
ried with vigor and grace. This horse, like all energetic creatures, is
not above medium size. Its articulations are large and strong, its
vigorous muscles show plainly beneath the skin. The rump, the
withers, the hind quarters, are above all remarkable for their strength.
The solid hocks are close together, a conformation peculiar to swift-
running animals, like the stag and the gazelle.

The shoulder and foreleg are free and muscular. The delicate legs
are clean cut, with detached tendons: the shank of the front lee is
usually short and the saphenous veins inconspicuous. The feet are

464 EGYPTIAN AND ARABIAN HORSES.

oval, with very hard black hoofs, the hind feet being sometimes a
little rounded in the back. The mane and tail are not very full. The
hide is delicate, the smooth and silky skin giving those splendid lights
never found except on oriental horses.

Nedjed, in the center of Arabia, is the home of the first races of
horse. The Arabs generally trace the origin of their breed of horses
into the most remote days of paganism. There are two races or gen-
eral divisions of Arabian horses; the Atik, that is to say, “ pure ” or
* pure blood,” born of Arabian father and mother; the Hedjin and the
Moukrif, both mongrel or half-breed, the first having an Arabian
father and a foreign mother, the second having an Arabian mother
and a father of another race.

In Persia, in Syria, in Egypt, and the Magreb, although these coun-
tries themselves produce excellent horses, the Arabian courser is given
the preference over all others, and the oriental warriors take great
pride in owning them.

This much-vaunted animal does not conform with the generally
accepted European standards of beauty in horseflesh, and many
judges refuse to accord him a degree of perfection beyond reproach.
Nevertheless, it is quite true that the Arabian steed surpasses all
others in a magnificent combination of speed and strength.

When the blood is the same, the Arabs prefer very much a mare to
a stallion for three reasons: The first consideration is the enormous
profit to be derived from the former. Cases are known in which
Arabs have made 10,000 or 20,000 douras ($10,000 to $20,000) on
the offspring of one mare. There is a saying, “ The fountain head of
wealth, a mare which foals a mare.” In the second place, a mare does
not neigh in an ambuscade or night attack, and is less sensible than
the stallion to hunger, thirst, and heat. Thirdly, in contrast to the
stallion the mare requires but little care; she does not need much food
and her master takes or sends her to pasture with the camels and
sheep, without the expense of an attendant sais to prevent her from
wandering off.

The Arabian horse has acclimated itself in every country where it
has been introduced and stands undisputed the finest warhorse in the
world. All climates are good to him, every latitude suits him, and he
is satisfied with any kind of food. The ordeals which these horses
underwent during the campaigns in Crimea and Russia are in them-
selves proof of this.

From the earliest times the Arabians have given studious attention
to distinctive marks by which they may at first glance recognize the
merits or defects of a horse.

The physical qualities prized mostly in their steeds are: A little

chest, hind quarters. high and rounded, belly inconspicuous, tail
short and fine, nervous legs with short, flexible pasterns, and hard
and ample hoofs. When the three principal qualities, that of head,
hind quarters, and of legs, are found together the horse is considered
perfect. But, on the other hand, when a horse shows any unlucky
sign they will have him neither for mount nor for stallion. For
there are several natural signs which the Arabs regard as significant.
some as sinister for the owner or rider, others as favorable and luck
bringing. Whatever superstitions they may show in simular matters
it is certain that these ideas have had root in long-extended observa-
tions, and that superstitious as they are they would never consent to
reduce by two-thirds the price of their borses bearing unlucky signs
if there were not some mysterious foundation of truth in these beliefs.

The greater parts of these signs are small feathers, or epis, situated
on different parts of the body. An “epi” is a little mesh or tuft of
hair which makes a slight projection on a horse’s hide. Each one of
these has to the Arab a significance according to the place where it
occurs and the length and fineness of the hair.

Here is a list of the most characteristic epis familiar in Mesopo-
tamia, Syria, Nedjed, which is to say in the countries where the most
beautiful horses of the Orient are found. The numbers refer to the

dicates the reverse.

Horses which have epis on both sides of the tail are execrable; they
are entirely bad when these funestral signs—probably identical with
those called Irmah (14)—are not balanced by some other signs.

The omens which the Arabs draw from markings and other signs
on their horses are not less remarkable than the qualities and faults
they deduce from the epis. A black horse without any spot will
bring misfortune. A black stripe on the back from the neck to the
tail is an enviable sign. Black spots on the fetlock joint diminish by
at least one-half the value of a stallion or colt. The horse with a hard
cornea is not only swift, but very patient into the bargain, while a
restive animal has, as a rule, small eyes and narrow nostrils. Horses
with tawny hair around the pasterns are good for breeding.

* Look out,” says the Arab, “ for spots which are not exactly cen-
tered in the forehead.

* Any horse which has a white star and no white feet will carry you
to‘destruction.

* Horses with black spots on the mouth are unlucky, wicked, and
inclined to bite and kick.
EGYPTIAN AND ARABIAN HORSES. 467

* A horse with white on his lips and mouth will run faster than the
wind. ‘

* A horse whose white face stops on its nose will rear continually
and throw the best of riders.

“Tf the upper lip is white underneath near the gums it is a favor-
able sign; if it is black it is unfavorable.

“ A white mark on each side of the chest, back of the stirrup, indi-
rates speed and safety; they are called * the wings.’

“The horse with long white stockings is a dangerous brute. If
the white runs higher on the right side than the left, sell him or pre-
pare your burial garment.

* The horse with the chest of a lion, the hind quarters of a wolf, and
the legs of a gazelle, long may he live.”

These maxims show, if any such proof is needed, the great care the
Arabs display in keeping pure the blood of their royal animal.

The preceding indicates sufficiently the superiority which the Ara-
bian charger has had, and still has, over other races. It is hardly
true—as many of our English trained horsemen insist—that the
English horse is only the Arabian increased in stature and endowed
with other qualities suited to the varied exigencies of civilization.
With its growth in size, the English horse has lost its long wind, its
courage, its sobriety, its endurance, and the suppleness of articula-
tion; all of which are characteristic of the Oriental horse. The
Arabian horse runs as well as the English, and if, as they say in
England, the Arabian is perfected in that country, it is only by saeri-
ficing all the solid qualities of the thoroughbred Arab to an exaggera-
tion to a single one—speed—a quality which nature has not seen fit to
give him as liberally as to more timid animals.

The horse, it has been said, is the expression of society; railroads,
the automobiles, bicycles, telegraph and telephone, everything man
has invented to devour space, though they tend to diminish the
necessity for the horse, will never cause him to disappear. In spite
of all our progress he will always remain an indispensable utility,
and, if only for the use of the Army, we should endeavor to preserve
the thoroughbred Arabian, the * regenerator ” of all other races.

BEES AND FLOWERS.

3y EK. L. Bouvier,
Professews au Muséum @Histoire Naturelle, Paris.

That bees visit flowers is well known to everybody, as is the fact
that these constant visits of theirs are by no means disinterested.
Of the flower the bee asks two things: The pollen dust from the sta-
mens and the sugared nectar, which most often is found at the bottom
of the corolla. The pollen serves as food immediately, but among the
social bees and very probably among the solitary species as well, the
nectar must first undergo a series of changes. The cane sugar in this
liquid, under the action of salivary products, is transformed into
glucose. It acquires a peculiar taste and odor, and, as honey, is de-
posited by the bee in the cells of its hive, where it is mixed with
pollen to form a nourishing paste, or consumed at once by its collector.

In their wild state adult bees live on honey and pollen exclusively ;
no other food will support them. Under domestication they will
accept certain substitutes, meal in the place of pollen, and sugared
water instead of nectar, but, when possible, they will invariably
return to the flowers and feed as do their wild relations.

Among the solitary species, the female bee makes this paste of pollen
and honey for her young: among the social bees, especially with our
common honeybee, it is the sterile females or drones who attend to
this duty. To speak more exactly I may say that the larvee of the
honeybee in their early stages are nourished with a pecuhar jelly,
rich in albuminoids secreted by the drone nurses, and that the larvee
of the queen bee subsist on this all through their evolution. Since
this jelly is produced by the nurses out of the honey and pollen, I do
not exaggerate when I say that these two substances are as necessary
to young bees as to old.

470 BEES AND FLOWERS.

Twill soon describe the wonderful implements which the bees use in
the collection of their food, but first let me show how sagacious they
are in their visits to the flowers in search of it. According to the
observations of Bonnier and de Lavens, the assignment of honey bees
to the various flowers varies considerably, but is always calculated.
Every morning each swarm sends out its scouts to explore the neigh-
borhood and to determine the proper plants and the places where they
grow. On the return of the advance guard great numbers of workers
go forth, some to collect pollen, others to pilfer for nectar. The prin-
ciple of the division of labor is observed perfectly, each toiler col-
lects one or other of the products exclusively, and almost always at
the same trip, at least, limits his visits to a single kind of flower.
Thus the work is done surely and rapidly.

* Bees and bumblebees,” says Darwin, “ are good botanists, for they
know that varieties can show great differences in the color of their
flowers without ceasing to belong to the same species. I have fre-
quently seen drones fly straight from a plant of Dictamnus frawinella,
usually all red, to a white variety; from a variety of Delphinium con-
solida and of Primula veris to one of an entirely different color; from
a dark purple Viola tricolor to a golden yellow one, and in two species
of Papaver from one variety to another of a very different color. But
in this last case, some bees flew impartially to one or the other species
and acted as though the two were simple varieties.”

Innumerable observations of this kind have been made. As Dar-
win indicates, the insects recognize at a distance the appearance of a
desired flower, and, without doubt, its perfume as well. As a result
of this instinct the honeybee adapts itself to circumstances and
following the order of florescence, frequently changes its field of
action. In the spring you find it visiting the few flowers then open,
especially the catkins. A little later it frequents the cherry trees, the-
peach trees, and the pear trees; still later, when most of the corallas
are radiant, the Leguminosae, especially the Robinia, the clover, and
sainfoin, are favorites. Apiarists recognize this faculty of choice as
an element to be considered in bee keeping, and often take advan-
tage of it by cultivating not far from the hives plants which are
covered with blossoms for a long time.

The processes employed by the bees for getting at the desired sweets
are far from uniform. ‘The honeybee, whose mandibles are not over
strong, usually satisfies himself by crawling into the corolla, the
Xylocopidae do not put themselves to so much trouble; one stroke
of their powerful jaws lays bare the nectar. The mason bees and the
bumble-bees often have recourse to the same rough method. Fre-
BEES AND FLOWERS. 471

quently the ingenious honey bee takes advantage of the perforations
made by earlier visitors of this class to get at the nectar more quickly.

But it is useless to dwell longer upon these points. Bees are
admirably adapted to the collection of nectar and of pollen, and these
two products are necessary to them and sufficient for them at any age,
so much so that one may say, with M. Perez, that “every species of
bee without exception would disappear if flowers should cease to
bloom or if they should cease to produce nectar and pollen.”

This fact well established—that flowers are indispensable to the bee,
it is next necessary to see if the bees are in return of any service to the
flowers, and, if so, how much. The question has been much discussed,
and to this chiefly are due the differences of opinion that T will speak
of in a few moments.

Refore entering the thick of the fray, let me explain a few of
the fundamental principles governing the fertilization of phanerog-
amous plants. In most of these plants, especially the more common
ones, the stamens, or male organs, and the ovules, or female organs,
are found in the same flower, which in that ease is called a hermaphro-
dite. On its periphery are found the stamens crowned by the anthers
containing the pollen and in the center rests one or more sacs which
are united to form the pistil and which inclose a varying number—
always infinitely less than the number of pollen grain—of ovules.
For these to become seeds it is necessary that the pollen germinate on
the pistil and, by working through it, unite with each ovule. In the
plants of which the flowers are unisexual—that is to say, some flowers
are male, others female—the process is the same except that in this
case it 1s necessary that the pollen be brought to the pistil of the
female flower.

This is brought about in two ways, by close fertilization and by
cross fertilization. In the former the ovules are impregnated by the
pollen of the flower which contains them, in the latter the fertilization
is from pollen of a different plant. Darwin has shown that cross fer-
tilization is much more advantageous to a plant than close, and that
the maximum benefit 1s obtained in the crossing of two varieties of the
same species. The advantage is shown in general by a more robust
vegetation, an earlier flowering, and the formation of more and better
seeds. Darwin’s demonstrations rest upon an abundance of experi-
ment and observation, and are, moreover, justified by modern practice
extended even into the animal kingdom.

Nothing indicates more clearly the advantages of cross fertiliza-
tion than does its great predominance in the vegetable kingdom; it
is absolutely necessary in the case of plants with unisexual flowers,
and, despite all appearances to the contrary, obtains in many, if not
A 2 BEES AND FLOWERS.

most, cases of plants with the bisexual flowers. For there is that
curious fact developed by Darwin and by many botanists, that
when pollen of the same flower and pollen from another flower of
the same species are placed simultaneously on the pistil of an her-
maphrodite flower the latter will germinate more rapidly and will
in most cases determine the fertilization. Clearly this must render
crossing almost inevitable. Although the pollen of an hermaphrodite
may fall directly on the contiguous pistil it is more than likely that
a puff of wind or the visit of an insect will place on the same stigma
some grains of foreign pollen in time to anticipate it.

But returning to the bees. We have shown the predominance of
cross fertilization among the flowering plants and pointed out the
advantages resulting to the plant. Now, if it can be demonstrated
that the bees are the most active agents in this cross fertilization
there will be no longer any doubt as to their usefulness.

All flowers, whether their reproductive organs mature simultane-
ously or at different times, give up their pollen to insects or to the
wind or in a very great majority of cases to both. Plants whose fer-
tilization depends entirely upon the action of the wind are called
anemophiles. Lacking insect allies, all the primitive Phanerogams
were anemophile exclusively, and have transmitted that characteristic
to their descendants; they are represented by the Gymnosperms with
unisexual flowers, of which the conifers are our best known type.
Since the wind is an absolutely blind instrument so much of the pollen
is lost that these anemophiles must produce considerable quantities.
Walk through the woods at Vincennes a few weeks hence, and if the
wind be right you will find the ground tinged with yellow by the
pollen of the massive pines.

However, plants exclusively anemophile are few; the greater
part of the flowering plants disseminate their pollen both by the wind
and by insects. These two agents of distribution are by no means
equally efficient; the wind blows the pollen dust about at random,
while the insects carry it direct to the pistils of the flowers they fre-
quent.

Darwin and numerous others found by experiment that at least
half of the plants we grow are rendered entirely or partially sterile
by being covered with a gauze to keep away the insects.

Generally speaking, the plants which require most insistently the
visit of insects are those whose flowers are the most irregularly
formed. Many of them have their flowers so arranged that the insect
is forced in his attempts to reach the nectar to cover himself with pol-
len and thus produce cross fertilization. In no case is this more strik-
ing than in that of the sages; in these abnormal Labiates two stamens
have disappeared and the other two have dwindled to a long con-
nective loaded with a pollen sac. Entering the throat of the flower
BEES AND FLOWERS. A473

to reach the nectar (at ng, fig. 1) the bee (D) strikes with his
head the short sterile arny (ac) which acts as a sort of lever to bring
down the long arm with its pollen sac (a) to cover his back with the
fertile dust. Thus laden the busy workman flies to another flower and,

With the exception of the Salvia coccina, studied by Ogle and Dar-

win, all the sages are thus fertilized by the bees.

Among the primroses we find a much larger and more varied

a different manner. As illustrated in the Primula vulgaris (fig. 2)

the style (st’) scarcely reaches beyond the middle of the tube of the
corolla and the stamers (a@’) are placed near the orifice; others (A)
where the position is reversed, the style (s¢) extending to the orifice
and the stamens forming a ring in the center of the tube.

To this remarkable difference is added another hardly less curious;
the pollen of the short-styled flowers is large grained (pg’) while the
pollen of the others comes in very small grains (pg). These plants
are therefore as ill adapted as possible to direct fertilization or cross
fertilization through the action of the wind. Some sort of insect
intervention becomes almost necessary. When a bee goes into one of
the short-styled flowers (B) he strikes the stamen with his head and
covers it with pollen dust. When he enters a flower of the other sort

heterostyle plants and has demonstrated that their fertilization is
almost always by crossing effected by the visits of insects.

Among the violets, the Aristolochiacee and many other Phanero-
gams, the arrangement of the parts of the flower renders even more
necessary the intervention of insects, but I pass them over in order to
reach the orchids, where in almost every case this intervention is abso-
lutely necessary.
BEES AND FLOWERS. 475

Figure 8 shows the details of an orchid: The great lip (/) of the
corolla ends in a long spur which incloses the nectar-producing
organs (vn). Near the front-of the spur the style expands into
a double stigma, which hangs beneath the one large anther (@).
Instead of being a diffused dust, the grains of pollen are closely con-
nected and form two masses (po), which are joined by the stipes (¢)
to a glutinous body (7) at the entrance of the spur. Except the
Ophrys apifera, which, thanks to a special structure, can do so, the
plants of this family are utterly incapable of self fertilization.
Nor can the wind aid them. The pollen grains can easily be lifted
up with a needle or pencil point from the glutinous mass where they
are collected. It is by an analagous process that honey bees effect
the cross-fertilization of these plants. On entering the spur in
search of nectar they come into contact with the viscous disk (A)
and generally carry off one or two of the pollen grains attached
somewhere on the front portion of their body. As Darwin has
shown, the sticky substance dries very quickly and when the insect

enters the spur of another flower the mass is abandoned so that it
becomes attached to the stigma, where it yields the fertilizing element.

The part that the insects play and the advantages of cross-fertiliza-
tion among the orchids are shown with all possible clearness in the
case of the vanilla. In Mexico this plant is fertilized naturally by
different insects, especially by the Melipones, which greatly resemble
our bees, but in other regions artificial fertilization is produced by
rubbing the stamen on the pistil with a needle. M. Lecomte, who
has studied the matter, attributes the superior quality of the Mexican
ranilla to the advantage of natural cross-fertilization over artificial
auto-fertilization. In our own greenhouses the vanilla plant has the
same ‘experiences—it can produce flowers, but no seed, without pre-
liminary fertilization.

We must therefore conclude that the Anthophila, and particularly
the Mellifera, have a place of no small importance in the fertilization
of flowering plants. They give them the advantages of crossing, and
in a large number of cases are absolutely essential to their repro-
duction.

AT6 BEES AND FLOWERS.

Perhaps M. Perez exaggerated their importance a little when he
said, with Dodel-Port, that “a hundred thousand species of plants
would disappear from the face of the earth ” if the bees ceased their
visits, but no one can doubt that such a contingency would cause a
very great disturbance in the vegetable kingdom.

We have now arrived at two facts of the first importance: Flowers
are necessary to bees, and bees, on their side, are very useful or even
necessary to the fertilization of flowering plants. It now remains
to inquire whether this reciprocity of service has had as a consequence
any reciprocal adaptation in the two sorts of beings.

It is generally admitted that all living things are subject to greater
or less variation, and that among these variations those which are
advantageous to the species are fixed and further developed by hered-
ity and natural selection. So if flowers are necessary to the bees
and bees are useful or necessary in the fertilization of flowers, it is

Fia. 5.—Side view of a honeybee.

only natural to suppese that all the variations which favor food col-
lection in the former and reproduction in the latter will in the course
of time be acquired and amplified. This is strictly reasonable: but
seience will not rest content with a priori generalizations, and we
must discover how far this logical conclusion is justified by actual
facts.

The adaption of the Mellifera to the collection of pollen and
nectar appears in various degrees through the whole series from the
Prosopis to the honeybee Apis mellifera. The structure of the for-
mer does not differ essentially from that of the wasps, only if the
jaw appendages have been a little elongated and the hairs a httle
more numerous we are at the beginning of the real evolution of the
Mellifera. In the honeybee, on the other hand, the evolution has
reached its highest point and shows itself plainly in the adaptations.
Vor the collection of pollen there are the collecting hairs which cover
every part of the body and which, on the inside of the first tarsal joint
BEES AND FLOWERS. 477

of the hind legs, are grouped to form a marvelous little brush. Little
balls of pollen gathered together by this covering are received in a
little basket-lhke depression on the outside face of these legs, where
they accumulate and are held by a fringe of curved hairs until the
workman, finding his ruffles growing too heavy, goes back to the
hive to get rid of his burden. For the collection of nectar the
adaptive modifications are even more perfect and more complicated.
With the exception of the mandibles, all the buccal appendages are
elongated and grouped so as to form a proboscis, which at rest is
folded twice upon itself, and in action is half as long as the body.
Hollowed out on the inner surface and stretched out to their fullest
extent the jaw-boxes and the labial feelers are joined to form the
sides of this organ; (fig. 6, nos. 3 and +) im the axis is the tongue,
sharp and rough, which is tipped with another tongue in miniature.

This tip is creased into a narrow gutter on its ventral surface ‘and
is entirely covered with little absorbent hairs. No more suitable
instrument could be devised for the collection of the liquid sugar in
the nectaries, for these organs are usually deeply buried in the corolla,
sometimes forming a circle at the base of the pistil, as in the
Crucifer (fig. 8, no. 2), sometimes relegated to the lower end of
the floral spur as in the orchid. (Fig. 4.) Thanks to the absorb-
ent hairs on the little tongue, the nectar is drawn in through the
capillary groove as far as the canal formed by the jawbones and the
labial feelers, thence it goes to the upper surface and mounts to the
mouth through the impulsion produced by the dilation and backward
and forward movement of the tongue. In order to understand this
mechanism one should watch bees when drinking water: A month
ago at the Laboratory of Vegetable Biology I saw a large number
thus occupied; gathered on a bit of moss which covered a little raft

they extended their proboscides and drank in the same way they
collect nectar.

Between these and the Prosopis there is a long series in which we
may see the instruments for collecting nectar improve step by step.
With the Nylocopidae, the Anthophoridae, and the Kuglossidae, we
arrive at the Mellifera,.where the social life does not yet exist, but
where the proboscis equals in perfection, and sometimes even sur-
passes, In development that of the common bee. Among the Euglos-
sidae it measures at least one and a half the length of the body.

The collection of pollen is effected by appendages which much
resemble those of the Halictinae, only the hairs are short and more or
less brush-like on the leg as well as on the first joint of the tarsus.
These brushes approach those of the honeybee without attaining the
same degree of perfection, for the differentiations which make the

basket has not yet taken place, and the double brush and the accom-
panying wrinkles must retain the pollen as well as collect it.

One step more and we arrive at the honey bee; here the brush on the
leg has been replaced by the basket and that of the first tarsal joimt
serves only to collect the pollen dust. The insect no longer waits until
he reaches the nest to mix this dust with the honey, but at the moment
he collects he makes little balls which he carries in his basket. To
respond to the exigencies of the social life the honey gatherer accumu-
lates a reserve and has acquired a faculty of secreting a waxy matter
which allows him to construct cells. However, these aptitudes are by
no means equally developed in all the forms of the group; at the foot
of the series are the bumble-bees who build without skill great ovoid
cells where they raise their young and store their reserves. These re-
serves are never large and often insufficient to provide for the colony

stitution and often disappear altogether at the approach of the bad
season. Even the Mellifera are more industrious and farsighted than
this. The reserve receptacles of their complicated nests in the tropical
regions somewhat resemble the cells of the bumble-bees, but they are
intended simply as magazines to hold enough provision to allow the
colony to maintain itself when the flowers cease to bloom. Those of
the honey bee are very different in character; they are intended ex-
clusively for the subsistence of the young and consist of a stratum of
cylindrical cells cleverly joined. This architecture brings us to that
of the bees, properly speaking, which rises to the perfection of sim-
plcity and economy of material. Here the cells are all of the same
type and are intended for stroage as well as for the rearing of the
young. They consist of hexagonal prisms separated by common
walls, and in each comb is formed two opposite layers separated by a
common base. No lost space, no materials wasted; these edifices are
marvels of construction.

Among the four species of bees known to us an appreciable differ-
ence in industry may be noticed; the little Apis florea and the great
Apis dorsata nest in the open air and build only a single comb; the
Apis indica constructs parallel combs, frequently in cavities, but nev-
ertheless readily accessible to Teigius and other enemies; finally,
our honey bee builds in the same way, but better protects his work by
rarefully driving away all parasites.

Thus, from Prosopis to the honeybee, we find a series growing more
and more perfect by degrees. These forms, developed in the course of
time, recall the various evolutionary stages through which the honey
bees have passed, and show how these insects unquestionably adapt
themselves to the flowers. The apiarists know that the honeybees
are not all equally adapted for nectar gathering, and that certain of
them collect more advantageously than others with longer tongues;
they have even invented a special apparatus, the glossometer, to meas-
ure the length of that organ. By rigorous selection these bee keepers
hope to fix a form in which the tongue will attain its highest develop-
ment. They will then be in possession of the race best suited to the
pursuit of nectar. With their marvelous instincts, how invaluable
will be our bees when they can get rid of the very long proboscis of
the Euglossidae ¢

Here we enter into the domain of hypothesis, but without depart-
ing from probability, for the honeybee is an essentially variable
creature. Native to Asia,” like all the other species of the genus,
they are now found all over the world from the equator to the extreme
limits of the temperate zones. Our black bee is already very different

from the Italian variety with its yellow fuzz, but both are even
still farther removed from the tropical bees, especially those of the
islands. Careful study is necessary to assign all these varieties to the
same type; there are thirty forms, most of which have been taken by
many zoologists for distinctive species.

To-day hardly anyone disputes the adaptation of bees to food-
gathering in the flowers, but the adaptation of the flowers to these
visitors remains an object of heated controversy. One of the schools,
headed by Darwin and Sir John Lubbock, exaggerates the influence,
while the other, M. Gaston Bonnier
and his pupils, denies its existence.

Before entering upon this deli-
cate question let me recall the pas-
sage in which Sir John Lubbock has
fixed its extent and portent. ‘“ Not
only,” says he, “ have the form and
the colors, the bright tints, the sweet
odors, and the nectar been gradually
developed by force of an uncon-
scious selection exercised by the in-
sects, but even the arrangement of

nectar is an adaptation to attract

insects. According to this author the nectaries are organs of reserve
where the cane sugar, dissolved in the cellular juice, is elaborated
and stored. As night falls, closing the air-stomata and arresting
the chlorovaporization, the emission of water vapor by the plant is
replaced by a sort of sweating, which comes slowly from all points of
the surface and the nectaries in the form of little drops more or less
rich in sugar. Thus the drops of nectar have the same origin as the
water given forth by the water-carrying stomata. They are the result
of a stoppage in the transpiration and do not present any peculiar
character other than that of having traversed organs rich in sac-
BEES AND FLOWERS. 481

charines. The nectar never contains more than a small part of the
sugar secreted by the nectaries.

When the insects do not collect the nectar soon after its emission
it is reabsorbed by the plant and serves to nourish the tissues and to
develop the organs, especially those for the formation of seeds. In a
word, it is for its own use, and not to attract bees for fertilization,
that the plant secretes nectar. It thereby accumulates reserves at the
points nearest to the place of utilization. Ordinarily this is in the
flower, where it best can serve the development of the seeds, but
sometimes it is in other parts of the body, where it is more needed.

It is therefore impossible to consider nectar and the nectaries en-
tirely as the products of an adaptation which would have as its result
the attraction of insects to its flowers. Sir John Lubbock seems to
me wrong on this point.

IT am not so certain about the odor. Whether it come from petals
or nectar, no one can doubt that it attracts the keen-sensed bees.
Their olfactory sensibility is demonstrated by the ability they show
in discovering honey in the closest places. In the small house in
which is kept the honey taken from the hives, at the Laboratory of
Vegetable Biology, I saw hundreds of bees. The building was per-
fectly tight and all the chinks in the windows stopped up, and in
spite of assiduous search it was impossible to discover the fissure
which gave entrance to the swarm. As an additional bit of evi-
dence, M. Perez very justly observes that bees frequenting the willow
‘atkins in the early spring always come thither from the side toward
which the wind blows the fragrance.

I do not forget that Sir John Lubbock has seen bees indifferent to
a bit of honey placed but a short distance from their hive, but believe
that Perez exactly interprets this experience when he says that the
collector bee at the moment when it goes out to work is ‘* exclu-
sively absorbed by the idea of its work,” and that it is “ indifferent to
all which is not the object of its activity of the moment.” Nor do I
ignore the fact that Gaston Bonier finds an objection to the theory of
attraction by perfumes in the bee’s indifference to the delicate fra-
grance of the I/elittis melissophyllum. But I also know that all
flowers are not equally attractive and that the Melittis is a plant
for which the bees show little taste.

We will therefore admit with a great majority of the naturalists
that the odor of flowers is an element of attraction for insects. As
a consequence is 1t necessary to believe with Darwin and Sir John
Lubbock that these perfumes are the product of an adaptation of the
flowers to the insect? It is rather bold to commit oneself to the
affirmative when so many plants are strongly scented in places other

sM 1904 31

482 BEES AND FLOWERS.

than their flowers. However, the vastly greater frequency with
which these perfumes are found in flowers leads one to admit that the
theory of the English authors has at least a great degree of proba-
bility. In any case no one will deny that the perfume in flowers does
attract insects, especially the honeybee.

Still more evident is the attraction of the colors in flowers. Who has
not seen bees flying through the fields choosing the favorite flowers and
disdaining all others? Numbers of cases have been cited in which
the bee evidently associated the notion of color with the idea of booty,
and in which the tints of the flowers alone served him as a guide.

IT would not dwell on this question had not two eminent naturalists,
Gaston Bonier and Plateau, denied “ that, all other things being
equal, brilhant colors in preference to those of duller shade attract
insects.” Plateau covered a dahlia, little by little, with green leaves
and observed that the bees continued their visits to the flowers in spite
of their green color. Monsieur Forel tried the same experiment by
pinning green leaves over twenty-eight out of fifty-three flowers of
various colors displayed in the same basket. He found that the bees
immediately ceased visiting the covered ones (and neglected them for
two hours until one bee discovered the stratagem), and within a short
time they were visited like the free blossoms. ‘ Plateau, therefore,
has experimented badly and drawn false conclusions,” says Monsieur
Forel. ‘ When he covered his dahhas he covered them slowly and
only on top. The bees perceived the trick and could still see the sides
of the dahlias. Plateau had failed to reckon with. the memory and
the attention of the bees.”

Gaston Bonnier experimented differently. On a smooth bit of
green turf about 20 m. from some hives he placed a row of rectan-
gles about 2 m. apart. These blocks, measuring 22 by 12 cm., were
red, green, white, or yellow, and all daubed with the same quality of
honey. They were impartially visited by the bees, with apparently z
sheht preference for the green. In considering this experiment one
should not forget that there was absolutely no reason why bees
absorbed in the search of nectar or pollen should visit these great.
colored rectangles which in nowise resembled flowers of any kind.

Monsieur Forel introduced into a basket of dahlias a number of
large artificial flowers in the heart of which he placed a bit of honey.
The bees were satisfied with the dahhas until one of their number
wandered ito the artificial flowers. As he repeated his trip he was
imitated by others until the dahlias were deserted and all the imita-
tions were visited except those colored green; this continued even
when the artificial flowers had been despoiled of their honey. All the
brilliant imitation attracted the bees; all of the green ones were
unnoticed. But, in drawing his deductions, I believe Forel is wrong
in not ascribing to bees a keen enough perception of odors; he forgets,
BEES AND FLOWERS. 483

as does Bonnier, when he offers as an argument against the attrac-
tions of color their visits to green catkins and honey-smeared leaves,
that bees allow themselves to be guided by all their senses, and do not
depend on smell or sight alone.

It seems, then, quite certain that the honey bees are attracted by
color in flowers, but not so certain that color is an adaptation of the
plant to the insect. Although the latter is believed by many of the
most distinguished naturalists it still wants conclusive demonstration.
Like the odor the adaptation does exist, but more than that can not be
said positively. However this may be, both of these agents serve to
attract the bees and in this way favor the fertilization of the phan-
erogams.

This is even more true of the variously complicated flowers—the
long-tubed corolla, the narrow spurs, the stamens covered ‘by the
petals. Granted that over and above the attraction they exercise on
the bees, the color and perfume of a flower may play some part in the
adaptation of a plant, the same can not be said with regard to these
complications of the calyx and corolla. How can the infinite variety
of these organs and their sometimes fantastic arrangement be
explained without recourse to the hypothesis of a reaction of the
plant toward the insect? This reaction began the day the first
insects visited the first flowers and is continued through the present.

To summarize: (1) Nectar and the nectaries are certainly in-
tended primarily for the plant itself and do not prove an adapta-
tion of the flower to the insects. (2) The colors and perfumes of
flowers may be, perhaps, the result of such an adaptation, but im any
‘ase they strongly attract anthophilian insects, signalling to them
the presence of booty. (3) In many cases, if not all, the complicated
forms of the flowers must be attributed to the adaptation of flowers to
their visitors.

Such is the state of our knowledge as it stands to-day, founded, I
think, on the closest observation and the best reasoning. In the very
nature of things adaptation requires long evolutionary periods; it
can rarely be proved directly, and evidence regarding it is only to be
obtained by long comparative observations.

However, it is almost unanimously conceded nowadays that the
Mellifera, at least in so far as their collecting aparatus is concerned,
ere beautifully adapted to the flowers, but, despite the fact that prac-
tice has shown that plants are in every way more plastic than ani-
mals, it is still strongly disputed that the flowering plants have
adapted themselves to bees.

If there does exist any reciprocal modification between the Mell-
fera and the flowering plants it is not at all necessary to suppose that
one group has been modified for the benefit of the other. Each has
evolved on its)own account. Explained thus, the many objections
484 BEES AND FLOWERS.

to the theory of reciprocal adaptation are overthrown. The bee has
but one object, the pursuit of food, and all things which aid him in it
are welcome. Usually the plant profits thereby ; sometimes it suffers.
On the other hand, the plant seeks only to assure its propagation and
all of its modifications tend only toward that goal. It is only indi-
rectly that the colors and perfumes are of advantage to insects; the
complicated flower, most favorable to the reproduction of the plant, is
to the bees an obstacle. The cleistogamous flowers give a striking
proof of the independence of a plant so far as insects are concerned,
These tiny, feeble flowers are close-fertilized without any interven-
tion; insects never visit them. Found generally among normal flow-
ers, they prove that plants seek by all possible means to render
fertilization inevitable.

Claude Bernard has splendidly formulated this truth in an aphor-
ism quoted by M. Gaston Bonnier in his work on the nectaries: ‘“ The
law of the physiological finality is in each individual being and not
outside it; the living organism is made for itself; it has its own
intrinsic laws. It works for itself and not for others.” It is not. pos-
sible better to define the reciprocal adaptations which we have shown
exists between bees and flowers. It is by no means for the benefit of
the plant that the collecting apparatus of the bees is modified, but
only that the bee may better nourish itself. On the other hand, it is
to the distinct advantage of the plant and its propagation that flow-
ers are modified in shape, color, and odor. The insect has gained by
the conformation of the flowers; the flower by the visits of the insect.
But each of these beings has been evolved on its own account and
adapted itself, as pointed out by the illustrious Lamarck, to the vital
conditions of the world in which it lives.
THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON.*

By Prof. W. A. HerpMaAN, D. Sc., F. R. S

The celebrated pearl “ oysters” of Ceylon are found mainly in
certain parts of the wide, shallow plateau which occupies the upper
end of the Gulf of Manaar, off the northwest coast of the island
and south of Adams Bridge.

The animal (Margaritifera vulgaris, Schum. = Avicula fucata,
Gould) is not a true oyster, but belongs to the family Aviculide,
and is therefore more nearly related to the mussels (J/yfilus) than
to the oysters (Ostrwa) of our seas.

The fisheries are of very great antiquity. They are referred to by
various classical authors, and Pliny speaks of the pearls from
Taprobane (Ceylon) as “ by far the best in the world.”  Cleopatr:
is said to have obtained pearls from Aripu, a small village on the
Gulf of Manaar, which is still the center of the pearl industry.
Coming to more recent times, but still some centuries back, we have
records of fisheries under the Cingalese kings of Kandy, and sub-
sequently under the successive European rulers—the Portuguese
being in possession from about 1505 to about 1655, the Dutch from
that time to about 1795, and the English from the end of the eight-
eenth century onward. A notable feature of these fisheries under
all administrations has been their uncertainty.

The Dutch records show that there were no fisheries between 1732
and 1746, and again between 1768 and 1796. During our own time
the supply failed in 1820 to 1828, in 1837 to 1854, in 1864 and several
succeeding years, and, finally, after five successful fisheries in 1887,
1888, 1889, 1890, and 1891, there has been no return for the last decade.
Many 1 reasons, some fanciful, others with more or less basis of truth,
have been given from time to time for these recurring failures of
the seen eh peveral 1 investigations, such as that a Doctor Kelaart

(who unfortunately died before his work was completed) in 1857
to 1859 and that of Mr. Holdsworth in 1865 to 1869, have been
undertaken without much practical result so far.

In September, 1901, Mr. Chamberlain asked me to examine the
records and report to him on the matter, and in the following spring
I was invited by the Government to go to Ceylon with a scientific
assistant and undertake any investigation into the condition of the
banks that might be considered necessary. I arrived at Colombo in
January, 1902, and, as soon as a steamer could be obtained, proceeded
to the pearl banks. In April it was necessary to return to my uni-
versity duties in Liverpool, but I was fortunate in having taken out
with me as my assistant Mr. James Hornell, who was to remain in
Ceylon for at least a year longer in order to carry out the observa-
tions and experiments we had arranged and complete our work.
This programme has been carried out, and Mr. Hornell has kept me
supplied with weekly reports and with specimens requiring detailed
examination.

The Ss. Lady Haveloch was placed by the Ceylon government
at my disposal for the work of examining into the biological condi-
tions surrounding the pearl oyster banks, and this enabled me on
two successive crises of three or four weeks each to examine all the
principal banks and run lines of dredging and trawling and other
observations across, around, and between them, in order to ascertain
the conditions that determine an oyster bed. Toward the end of my
stay I took part in the annual inspection of the pearl banks, by
means of divers, along with the retiring inspector, Capt. J. Donnan,
C. M. G., and his successor Captain Legge. During that period we
lived and worked on the native bark Pangasameeporawee and had
daily opportunity of studying the methods of the native divers and
the results they obtained.

It is evident that there are two distinct questions that may be
raised—the first as to the abundance of the adult “ oysters” and
the second as to the number of pearls in the oysters, and it was the
first of these rather than the frequency of the pearls that seemed
to call for investigation, since the complaint has not been as to the
number of pearls per adult oyster, but as to the complete disappear-
ance of the shellfish. I was indebted to Captain Donnan for much
kind help during the inspection, when he took pains to let me see as
thoroughly and. satisfactorily as possible the various banks, the
different kinds and ages of oysters, and the conditions under which
these and their enemies exist. I wish also to record my entire satis-
faction with the work done by Mr. Hornell, both while I was with
him and also since. It would have been quite impossible for me to
THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON. 487

have got through the work I did in the very limited time had it not
been for Mr. Hornell’s skilled assistance.¢

Most of the pearl oyster banks or “* paars” (meaning rock or any
form of hard bottom, in distinction to “ manul,” which indicates loose
or soft sand) are in depths of from 5 to 10 fathoms arid occupy the
wide shallow area of nearly 50 miles in length, and extending oppo-
site Aripu to 20 miles in breadth, which lies to the south of Adam/’s
Bridge. On the western edge of this area there is a steep deelivity,
the sea deepening within a few miles from under 10 to over 100 fath-
oms, While out in the center of the southern part of the Gulf of
Manaar, to the west of the Chilaw Pearl Banks, depths of between
1,000 and 2,000 fathoms are reached. On our two eruises in the
Lady Havelock we made a careful examination of the ground in sev-
eral places outside the banks to the westward, on the chance of finding
beds of adult oysters from which possibly the spat deposited on the
inshore banks might be derived. No such beds outside the known
“paars” were found, nor are they likely to exist. The bottom
deposits in the ocean abvsses to the west of Ceylon are “ globigerina
ooze” and “ green mud.” which are entirely different in nature and
origin from the coarse ferrigenous sand, often cemented into masses,
and the various caleareous neritic deposits, such as corals and nulli-
pores, found in the shallow water on the banks. The steepest part
of the slope from 10 or 20 fathoms down to about 100 fathoms or
more all along the western coast seems tn most places to have a hard
bottom covered with Aleyonaria, sponges, deep-sea corals, and other
large encrusting and dendritic organisms. Neither on this siope nor
in the deep water beyond the chff did we find any ground suitable
for the pearl oyster to live upon.

Close to the top of the steep slope, about 20 miles from land, and
in depths of from 8 to 10 fathoms, is situated the largest of the
“paars,” the celebrated Periya Paar, which has frequently figured
in the inspector’s reports, has often given rise to hopes of great
fisheries, and has as often caused deep disappointment to successive
Government officials. The Pertya Paar runs for about 11 nautical
miles north and south, and varies from 1 to 2 miles in bredth, and

this—for a paar—large extent of ground becomes periodically cov-
ered with young oysters, which, however, almost invariably dis-
appear before the next inspection. This paar has been called by
the natives the “ mother paar” under the impression that the young
oysters that come and go in fabulous numbers migrate or are carried
inward and supply the inshore paars with their populations. Dur-
ing a careful investigation of the Periya Paar and its surroundings

aMr. Hornell is now marine biologist to the Ceylon government and inspector
of the pearl banks.—-W. A. H. January, 1905.

.
455 THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON.

we satisfied ourselves that there is no basis of fact for this belief:
and it became clear to us that the successive broods of young oysters
on the Periya Paar, amounting probably within the last quarter
century alone to many millions of millions of oysters, which if they
had been saved would have constituted enormous fisheries, have all
been overwhelmed by natural causes, due mainly to the configuration
of the ground and its exposure to the southwest monsoon.

The following table shows, in brief, the history of the Periya
Paar for the last twenty-four years:

Feb., 1880. Abundance of young oysters.

Mar., 1882. No oysters on the bank.

Mar., 1883. Abundance of young oysters, 6 to 9 months old.

Mar., 1884. Oysters still on bank, mixed with others of 8 months old.

Mar., 1885. Older oysters gone, and very few of the younger remaining.

Mar., 1886. No oysters on bank.

Noy., 1887. Abundance of young oysters, 2 to 3 months.

Noy., 1888. Oysters of last year gone and new lot come, 3 to 6 months.

Noy., 1889. Oysters of last year gone; a few patches 8 months old present.

Mar., 1892. No oysters on the bank.

Mar., 1898. Abundance of oysters of 6 months old.

Mar., 1894. No oysters on the bank.

Mar., 1895. Ditto.

Mar., 1896. Abundance of young oysters, 3 to 6 months.

Mar., 1897. No oysters present. ,

Mar., 1898. Ditto.

Mar., 1899. Abundance of oysters, 3 to 6 months old.

Mar., 1900. Abundance of oysters 8 to 6 months old; none of last year’s

remaining.

Mar., 1901. Oysters present of 12 to 18 months of age, but not so numerous as
in preceding year.

Mar., 1902. Young oysters abundant, 2 to 838 months. Only a few small
patches of older oysters (2 to 25 years) remaining.

Noy., 1902. <All the oysters gone.

It is shown by the above that since 1880 the bank has been natur-
ally restocked with young oysters at least eleven times without yield-
ing a fishery.

The 10-fathom line skirts the western edge of the paar, and the 100-
fathom line is not far outside it. An examination of the great slope
outside is sufhicient to show that the southwest monsoon running up
toward the Bay of Bengal for six months in the year, must batter
with full force on the exposed seaward edge of the bank and cause
great disturbance of the bottom. We made a careful survey of the
Periya Paar in March, 1902, and found it covered with young oysters
a few months old. In my preliminary report to the Government,
written in July, I estimated these young oysters at not less than
100,000 millions, and stated my belief that these were doomed to
destruction and ought to be removed at the earliest opportunity to a
THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON. 489

safer locality further inshore. Mr. Hornell was authorized by the
governor of Ceylon to carry out this recommendation, and went to the
Periva Paar early in November with boacs and appliances suitable
for the work, but found he had arrived too late. The southwest mon-
soon had intervened, the bed had apparently been swept clean, and
the enormous population of young oysters, which we had seen in
March, and which might have been used to stock many of the smaller
inshore paars, was now in all probability either buried in sand or car-
ried down the steep declivity into the deep water outside. This expe-
rience, taken along with what we know of the past history of the bank
as revealed by the imspectors’ reports, shows that whenever young
oysters are found on the Periya Paar they ought, without delay, to be
dredged up in bulk and transplanted to suitable ground in the Cheval
district—the region where the most reliable paars are placed.

From this example of the Periva Paar it is clear that in considering
the vicissitudes of the pearl oyster banks we have to deal with great
natural causes which can not be removed, but which may to some
extent be avoided, and that consequently it is necessary to introduce
large measures of cultivation and regulation in order to increase the
udult population on the grounds, give greater constancy to the sup-
ply, and remove the disappointing fluctuations in the fishery.

There are in addition, however, various minor causes of failure of
the fisheries, some of which we are able to investigate. The pearl
oyster has many enemies, such as star-fishes, boring sponges which
destroy the shell, boring mollusks which suck out the animal, internal
Protozoan and Vermean parasites and carnivorous fishes, all of which
cause some destruction and which may conspire on occasions to ruin
a bed and change the prospects of a fishery. But in connection with
such zoological enemies it 1s necessary to bear in mind that from the
fisheries point of view their influence is not wholly evil, as some of
them are closely associated with pearl production in the oyster. One
enemy (a Plectognathid fish) which doubtless devours many of the
oysters, at the same tinie receives and passes on the parasite which
leads to the production of pearls in others. The loss of some individ-
uals is in that case a toll that we very willingly pay, and no one would
xdvocate the extermination of that particular enemy.

In fact, the oyster can probably cope well enough with its animate
environment if not too recklessly decimated at the fisheries, and if
man will only compensate to some extent for the damage he does by
giving some attention to the breeding stock and “ spat,” and by trans-
planting when required the growing young from unsuitable ground
to known and reliable * paars.”

Those were the main considerations that impressed me during our
work on the banks, and, therefore, the leading points in the conclu-

.
490 THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON.

sions given in my preliminary report (July, 1902) to the governor
of Ceylon ran as follows:

1. The oysters we met with seemed, on the whole, to be very
healthy.

2. There is no evidence of any epidemic or of much disease of any
kind.

3. A considerable number of parasites, both external and internal,
both Protozoan and Vermean, were met with, but that is not unusual
in mollusks, and we do not regard it as affecting seriously the oyster
population.

4. Many of the larger oysters were reproducing actively.

5. We found large quantities of minute “ spat ” in several places.

6. We also found enormous quantities of young oysters a few
months old on many of the paars. On the Periya Paar the number
of these probably amounted to over 100,000 million.

7. A very large number of these young oysters never arrive at
maturity. There are several causes for this.

8. They have many natural enemies, some of which we have deter-
mined.

9. Some are smothered in sand.

10. Some grounds are much more suitable than others for feeding
the young oysters, and so conducive to life and growth.

11. Probably the majority are killed by overcrowding.

12. They should therefore be thinned out and transplanted.

13. This can be easily and speedily done, on a large scale, by
dredging from a steamer, at the proper time of year, when the young
oysters are at the best age for transplanting.

I4. Finally, there is no reason for any despondency in regard to
the future of the pearl oyster fisheries, if they are treated scientific-
ally. The adult oysters are plentiful on some of the paars and seem
for the most part healthy and vigorous, while young oysters in their
first year, and masses of minute spat just deposited, are very abun-
dant in many places.

To the biologist two dangers are, however, evident, and, paradox-
ical as it may seem, these are overcrowding and overfishing. But the
superabundance and the risk of depletion are at the opposite ends of
the hfe cycle, and therefore both are possible at once on the same
ground—and either is sufficient to cause locally and temporarily a
failure of the pearl oyster fishery. What is required to obviate these
two dangers ahead and insure more constancy in the fisheries, 1s
careful supervision of the banks by some one who has had sufficient
biological training to understand the life problems of the animal,

and who will therefore know when to carry out simple measures of
farming, such as thinning and transplanting, and when to advise as
to the regulation of the fisheries.
THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON. 49]

In connection with cultivation and transplantation, there are vari-
ous points in structure, reproduction, life-history, growth and habits
of the oyster which we had to deal with, and some of which we were
able to determine on the banks, while others have been the subject of
Mr. Hornell’s work since, in the little marine laboratory we estab-
lished at Galle.

Although Galle is at the opposite end of the island form the pear!
banks or Manaar, it is clearly the best locality in Ceylon for a marine
laboratory—both for general zoology and also for working at pearl
oyster problems. Little can be done on the sandy exposed shores of
Manaar island or the Bight of Condatchy—the coasts opposite the
pearl banks. The fisheries take place far out at sea, from 10 to 20
miles off shore; and it is clear that any natural history work on the
pearl banks must be done not from the shore, but as we did, at sea
from a ship during the inspections, and can not be done at all during
the monsoons because of the heavy sea and useless exposed shore.
At such times the necessary laboratory work supplementing the
previous observations at sea can be carried out much more satisfac-
torily at Galle than anywhere in the Gulf of Manaar.

Turning now from the health of the oyster population on the
“ paars,” to the subject of pearl formation, which is evidently an un-
healthy and abnormal process, we find that in the Celyon oyster
there are several distinct causes that lead to the production of pearls.
Some pearls or pearly excrescences on the interior of the shell are due
to the irritation caused by boring sponges and burrowing worms.
French writers have made similar observations in the case of Donax
and other Lamellibranchs; and -Dubois (1901) has more recently
ascribed the production of pearls in mussels on the French coast, to
the presence of the larva of Distomum margaritarum. Jameson
(1902) then followed with a more detailed account of the relations
between the pearls in Mytilus and the Distomid larvee, which he
identifies as Distomum (Brachyecelium) somaterizw (Levinson).
Jameson’s observations were made on mussels obtained partly at Bil-
hers (Morbihan), a locality at which Dubois had also worked, and
partly at the Lancashire Sea-Fisheries marine labortory at Piel in
the Barrow Channel. Finally, Dubois has just published a further
pote in which, referring to the causation of pearls in Mytilus, he
says: “ En somme ce que ce dernier [Garner] avait vu en Angle-
terre en 1871, je Val retrouvé en Bretagne en 1901. Quelques jours
apres mon départ de Bilhers, M. Lyster Jameson, de Londres,
est venu dens la méme localité et a confirmé le fait observé par
Garner et par moi.” But Jameson has done rather more than that.
He has-shown that it is probable (his own words are “ there is hardly
any doubt”) that the parasite causing the pearl-formation in our
499 THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON.

common mussel (not in the Ceylon “ pearl oyster”) is the larva of

Distomum somaterivw, from the eider duck and the scoter. He also
beheves that the larva inhabits Tapes or the cockle as a first host
before getting into the mussel.

We have found, as Kelaart did, that in the Ceylon pearl oyster
there are several different kinds of worms commonly occurring as
parasites, and we shall, I think, be able to show in our final report that
Cestodes, Trematodes, and Nematodes are all concerned in pearl
formation. Unlike the case of the European mussels, however, we
find so far that in Ceylon the most important cause is a larval Cestode
of the Tetrarhynchus form. Mr. Hornell has traced a considerable
part of the life history of this parasite from an early free-swimming
stage to a late larval condition in the file fish (Balistes mitis) which
frequents the pearl banks and preys upon the oysters. We have not
yet succeeded in finding the adult, but it will probably prove to infest
the sharks or other large Elasmobranchii which devour Balistes.

It is only due to my excellent assistant, Mr. James Hornell, to state
that our observations on pearl formation are mainly due to him.
During the comparatively limited time (under three months) that I
had on the banks I was mainly occupied with what seemed the more
important question of the life conditions of the oyster, in view of the
frequent depletion of particular grounds.

It is important to note that these interesting pearl-formation para-
sites are not only widely distributed over the Manaar banks, but also
on other parts of the coast of Ceylon. Mr. Hornell has found Balistes
with its Cestode parasite both at Trincomalie and at Galle, and the
sharks also occur all around the island, so that there can be no ques-
tion as to the probable infection of oysters grown at these or any other
suitable localities.

There is still, however, much to find out in regard to all these
points and other details affecting the life of the oyster and the pros-
perity of the pearl fisheries. Mr. Hornell and I are still in the mid-
dle of our investigations, and this must be regarded as only a prelimi-
nary statement of results which may have to be corrected, and I hope
will be considerably extended in our final report.

It is interesting to note that the Ceylon Government Gazette of
December 22 last announced a pearl fishery to commence on Iebru-
ary 22, during which the following banks would be fished: The
Southeast Cheval Paar, estimated to have 49 milhon oysters; the
East Cheval Paar, with 11 milhons; the Northeast Cheval Paar,
with 13 millions; the Periya Paar Kerrai, with 8 million—making in
all over 80 million oysters.

That fishery is now in progress, Mr. Hornell is attending it, and
THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON. 493

we hope that it may result not merely in a large revenue from pearls,¢
but also in considerable additions to our setentific knowledge of the
oysters.

As an incident of our work in Ceylon, it was found necessary to
fit up the scientific man’s workshop—a small laboratory on the edge
of the sea—with experimental tanks, a circulation of sea water, and
facilities for microscopic and other work. For several reasons, as
was mentioned above, we chose Galle, at the southern end of Ceylon,
and we have every reason to be satisfied with the choice. With its
large bay, its rich fauna, and the sheltered collecting ground of the
lagoon within the coral reef it is probably one of the best possible
spots for the naturalist’s work in eastern tropical seas.

In the interests of science it 1s to be hoped, then, that the marine
laboratory at Galle will soon be established on a permanent basis,
with a suitable equipment. It ought, moreover, to be of sufficient
size to accommodate two or three additional zoologists, such as
members of the staff of the museum and of the medical college at
Colombo or scientific visitors from Europe. The work of such men
would help im the investigation of the marine fauna and in the eluci-
dation of practical problems, and the laboratory would soon become
a credit and an attraction to the colony. Such an institution at
Galle would be known throughout the scientific world, and would
be visited by many students of science, and it might reasonably be
hoped that in time it would perform for the marine biology and the
fishing industries of Ceylon very much the same important functions
as those fulfilled by the celebrated gardens and laboratory at Pera-
deniya for the botany and associated economic problems of the land.

aTt was a most successful fishery. <A still larger one, bringing in over a mil-
lion rupees to the Government, was held in 1904, and there are now excellent
prospects for an important fishery in the spring of 1905.—W. A. H., January,

FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

By THEODORE GILL.

Flight is a preeminent attribute of terrestrial animals and is more
especially associated by most persons with the birds, but it is by no
means an uncommon faculty. Indeed, not to be able to fly is the ex-
ception for land animals, if number of species determine such a
problem. This will be evident when it is remembered that all but a
small percentage of insects fly, and insects are far more numerous
than all other inhabitants of the land combined. Furthermore, the
birds, whose chief attribute is the power of flight and adaptation
therefor, are more numerous than all other terrestrial vertebrates to-
gether. We may repeat, therefore, that non-flight is exceptional and
flight the normal provision for animals generally; flight, indeed, has
been developed anew, time after time, in animals with limbs of the
ambulatorial type.

The power of flight 1s also generally attributed to certain fishes, and
it is interesting and significant that the adaptation and power which
enable fishes to course through the air have also been developed in
several entirely distinct groups. The faculty exists in its greatest
perfection in two widely distinct families, one (the Exoccetids) being
unarmed, soft-finned fishes of the group called Synentognathi and
the other (the Dactylopterids) being armed acanthopterygian fishes
related to the Gurnards. There are other fishes—-among them rela-
tions of the Exocoetines and Dactylopterids—which have the power
of progressing through the air to some extent, but their power to do
so is so much less than those generally called flying fishes that they
need not be considered here. ‘Those to be now described will there-
fore be confined to the two famihes indicated—the Exoccetids and
Dactylopterids.

Tn all the flying fishes the power of flight, or rather sustentation in
the air, is effected in the same manner, that is, by the elongation of

495
496 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

the rays of the pectoral fins and a corresponding extension of the
inter-radial membrane.¢ By this amplification of surface the fishes
are buoyed up in the air. The pectoral fins are not used in the
impulse which takes them out of the water; the sole impelling organ
is the caudal fin. The muscles of the pectoral fins of flying fishes
are little, if any, more developed than in fishes having normally
strong pectorals. This weakness of the muscles operating the pec-
toral members contrasts remarkably with the great development of
the pectoral and other muscles which impart the power of real flight
to bats and birds.

A noteworthy coincidence is the limitation of flying fishes to the
ocean-—the great expanse of waters. None are found in bodies of
fresh water, however large they may be, and this is equally applicable
to the tropical sea lake of Tanganyika as it is to the northern Lake
Superior. The only approximate exception has been indicated by
the French traveler, Jacques Savorgnan de Brazza, who claimed
that the ttle Pantodon buchholzi of the fresh waters of West Africa
has the faculty of emerging from the water and sustaining itself for
a short time in the air; thus it may be regarded to some extent as “a
fresh water flying fish,” as Boulenger has stated. The extent of the
Pantodon’s aerial excursions must be very limited, however, as the
extension of the pectoral fins is comparatively limited; in fact, its
excursions must be leaping rather than flying.

This Pantodon (P. buchholz7) is the sole known representative of a
peculiar African family, the Pantodontids, related to the Osteoglos-
sids. The only authority for considering it a flying fish is the des-
ignation given to it by the French traveler, Jacques Savorgnan
de Brazza. He obtained a single specimen at Nganchou (or Gant-
shu), on the Congo, while obtaining water for drinking, and it was
exhibited in a collection made by him as a flying fish (‘ petit poisson
volant ”).” As such it is illustrated in the Cambridge Natural His-
tory (VII, 559) by Boulenger, who calls attention to it as “ observed
by M. de Brazza to be a freshwater flying fish.” The fish only
attains a length of about 4 inches.

The very words of the travelers and others, whose observations have
been utilized, are preserved when the continuity of the narrative
permits.

a'The rays to some extent correspond to or are homologous with the digits of
the wing of a bat or bird, and the ” of a fish is therefore more like that

‘

‘wing

of a bat than that of a bird; the wing of the fish, however, corresponds only

to the distal portion of the bat’s wing—that beyond the carpel bend.

The Exocetids, or true flying-fish family, manifest considerable
diversity in form and in extension of the jaws, but agree in having the
supramaxillaries only in contact (and not united) with the intermaxil-
laries, lower pharyngeals united in a broad triangular body, third
pair of upper pharyngeals much enlarged, and the vertebrae desti-
tute of zvygapophysoid processes. They naturally fall into three
groups or subfamilies, the Flying fishes proper or Exoccetines, the
Sauries or Scomberesocines, and the Halfbeaks or Hemirhamphines.

Another very characteristic feature is the course of the lateral line;
this is developed low down on each side of the abdomen and above
the anal fin to the lower lobe of the caudal.

The flying fishes proper, or Exoccetines, have both jaws rounded or
simply angulated in front, and the pectoral fins are generally greatly
enlarged and adapted to the sustentation of the body in the air. Not-
withstanding this striking specialization of the group, there are con-
siderable differences. All agree, however, but in various degrees, in
provision for emergence by leaping from the water and for progress
in the air.

The form is adapted for the life most of them lead; the subfusi-
form shape, with a quadrate periphery and with the sharp cut front,
is fitted for progress in water as well as air with the least friction.
The elongated lower lobe of the caudal enables a final strong upward
impulse to be given to the leaping fish; the pectoral and ventral fins
are enlarged with the maximum of surface to sustain the body in the
air and the minimum of weight in the framework. Their foremost
rays are also sharp edged forward so as to act, in analogy with cut-
waters, as “ cutairs ” as well as cutwaters. The air bladder is greatly
enlarged and filled with a gaseous emanation (mostly nitrogen),
which diminishes the relative weight of the body.

The flying fishes are mostly true pelagic animals, and some—one or
more—may be met with in midocean in every tropical and sub-
tropical sea, while a few wander into northern and southern tem-
perate regions. Although such may be the case, however, most of
them probably live within 100 or 200 miles of land, and the geo-
graphical distribution of some, at least, is not much less restricted
than that of ordinary shore fishes. “About 65 species” have been
described; and of those about 20 have been found in American seas,
the others, of course, being limited to that extent at least. Five of
the American species have not been found elsewhere, Cypselurus

xenopterus, C. californicus, and C. callopterus being known only from
SM 1904——32

.
498 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

the Pacific coast of America, and (. gibbifrons and C. cyanopterus
from the Atlantic. The others enjoy a wide range and most are
found both in the Atlantic and Pacific.

There is a notable uniformity in size for so large a group, the
extremes for full-grown of different species being near 8 inches at
one extremity and 18 at the other. About a foot is near the average
and a foot and a half appears to be the usual length of the full-grown
Californian flying fish (Cypselurus californicus), and sometimes at
least attained by several others.

All are gregarious and keep quite close together in large—sometimes
very large—schools. They often swim at or very near the surface of
the water, with the pectoral and ventral fins pressed close to the body,
or at least not far divergent from the sides and below, and are pro-
pelled “by rapid, long, sweeping strokes of the tail and posterior
half of the body.” But every now and then the pectoral fin on one
side is slowly expanded to its full extent for the purpose, it appears,
of simply stretching them for exercise, as they swim on without
turning with the fin open. The effect of this expansion appeared
to Hugh Smith “ exceedingly striking and pretty, the fin looking
like silver, and when several of the fish were in company the flash
‘raused by a fin being opened, now here, now there, now on one side
of a fish, and then on the other, heightened the effect considerably.
It was curious to note, when the expanding fin was closed, how com-
pletely it disappeared, altering the appearance of the fish entirely.”
Sometimes in sport, sometimes to escape pursuing enemies, with
increased vigorous movements of the tail, they spring out of the
water, immediately spread their pectoral and ventral fins, and start
an aerial progress known as flight.

The so-called flight of the flying fishes has been the subject of much
heated controversy. The coolest and most scientific treatment of
the question has been made by Karl Mébius, and most of the best
equipped recent investigators have come to the same or similar con-
clusions as he did. Flying fishes do not fly any more than flying
squirrels, flying opossums, flying lemurs, flying lizards, or flying
frogs; they do not fly like birds or bats or most insects. The answer
to the question, “ Do flving fishes fly?” will therefore depend on what
is called flight. If flight is the act or result of a volitional series of
beats of the wings, as in birds, then fishes do not fly; if the word be
extended to cover the use of quasi-wings for inactive sustentation of
the body or as parachutes, as in flying squirrels or flying opossums,
then flying fishes may fly.

Mobius (1878, 1885) contended that “ Flying fish are incapable
of flying [the italics are his] for the simple reason that the muscles
of their pectoral fins are not large enough to bear the weight of their
body aloft in the air. The pectoral muscles of birds depressing their
FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS. 499

wings weigh, on an average, one-sixth of the total weight of the body,
the pectoral muscles of bats one-thirteenth, the muscles of the pectoral
fins of flying fish only one thirty-second. The impulse to which
flying fish owe their long shooting passage through the air js deliv-
ered while they are still in the water by the powerful masses of mus-
cle on both sides of their body, which are of much greater breadth
than in the case of the herring or any other fish of their own size.”

The movement of the pectoral fins, described generally as flickering,
vibrating, or flapping, “is only a vibration of their elastic membrane,
and is to be referred to the same laws as those which govern the
flapping of a tight-set sail when a ship under a stiff breeze is driving
close to the wind. The flapping or vibration at once springs up
whenever the sail gets parallel to the wind.

“ The more rapidly a flying fish darts out of the water the greater
is the momentum with which the air presses on the outspread pectoral
fins. Should, now, the atmospheric pressure induce these fins into a
horizontal position parallel to the wind their vibration is a necessary
result. Let the outspread pectoral fins of a dead flying fish be held
horizontally before the opening of a pair of bellows and the fins will
be seen to vibrate as soon as the current of air passes under them.”

Such are the conclusions enunciated by Mobius in a special memoir
(in German) on the movements of flying fish through the air( 1878)
as epitomized in 1885. These, however, were vigorously objected to
by C. O. Whitman (1880), who urged, “ Admitting that in form,
size, length, and structure the pectoral fins of Exvocatus are less well
adapted to flight than the wings of most birds, there is still ample
room to believe, on anatomical and physiological grounds alone, that
they are capable of executing true flight.”

Opposed to this view are the expressed opinions of many distin-
guished traveler-naturalists. Moseley, who circumnavigated the
globe as naturalist of the great Challenger Expedition, expressly
declares that he had “never seen any species of Hvoca@tus flap its
wings at all during flight. These fish merely make a bound from the
water and skim, supported by their extended fins, the tips of which
meanwhile quiver in the air occasionally from the action of air cur-
rents against them, and sometimes from the shifting a little of their
inchnation by the fish.” Jordan and Evermann (1896), who had
many opportunities for observation “under most favorable condi-
tions,” were convinced that “no force is acquired while the fish is
in the air. On rising from the water the movements of the tail are
continued until the whole body is out of the water. While the tail
is in motion, the pectorals.seem to be in a state of rapid vibration,
but this is apparent only, due to the resistance of the air to the motions
of the animal. While the tail is in the water the ventrals are folded.
When the action of the tail ceases, the pectorals and ventrals are
500 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

spread and held at rest. They are not used as wings, but act rather
as parachutes to hold the body in the air.” Boulenger, the best-
informed ichthyologist of Europe, voices the general verdict in the
apt declaration (1904) that “nearly all” the family “are in the
habit of making great leaps out of the water,” and this tendency
culminates “ in the flying fish (/’voc@tus), which skip or sail through
the air in a manner the explanation of which has given rise to much
controversy. According to the latest evidence, the sole source of
motive power is the action of the strong tail while in the water. No
force is acquired while the fish is in the air. The pectorals are not
used as wings, but as parachutes.”

The contention that flying fishes have the power to materially
modify their course in midair is generally thought by qualified ich-
thyologists to be not corroborated by their structure or by exact
observation. Louis Agassiz (1868), however, was “ confident not
only that they change the direction of their flight, but that they
‘aise or lower their line of movement repeatedly without returning
to the water.”

They must have leverage to work from, and after leaving water
they must go as their final impulse directs or as the wind determines.
Even those who contend that they can direct their course may admit
that “when in mid flight” they can not “suddenly divert their
course.” Mathew (1873) observed one which “emerged from the
sea within 10 yards of the ship and flew directly toward her, coming
so violently into contact with the ship’s side that it fell stunned, and
floated astern on the surface of the sea with its pectoral fins rigidly
expanded.” Possibly they may be able sometimes to flex the tail
or fold one fin in the air and thus change the course to some degree.

The extent of flight at a single stretch naturally varies with cir-
cumstances. The best estimate has been that an ordinary flight may
extend from 30 to 50 vards in less than twenty seconds, but this may
be reenforced by dipping in the sea and obtaining a new basis for pro-
pulsion. Mathew (1873) thought that “200 yards would be an
unusually long flight,” but had “ occasionally seen individuals go at
least 100 yards farther,” and believed “if hard pressed they could
even exceed that.” Mr. F. A. Lucas writes to me: “I have seen
this fish come aboard from leeward and have seen them fly very much
more than 200 yards. I have seen them come up to the vessel’s bow,
but they did not alter their course; simply folded their wings and
dropped back again.” He explained that “ the distance a fish travels
through the air, after ricocheting from a wave top, before it again
touches the sea is often much greater than its original fight, and
besides gaining fresh impetus from this contact they also remoisten
their gills and refresh themselves.” Jordan and Evermann esti-
mated that “they will ‘fly’ a distance of from a few rods to more
FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS. 501

than an eighth of a mile, rarely rising more than 3 or 4 feet. * * *

When the fish begins to fall, the tail touches the water, when its
motion again begins, and with it the apparent motion of the pectorals.
Tt is thus enabled to resume its flight, which it finishes with a splash.
When in the air it resembles a large dragon fly. The motion is very
swift, at first in a straight line, but later deflected into a curve. The
motion has no relation to the direction of the wing. When a vessel
is passing through a school of these fishes, they spring up before it
as grasshoppers In a meadow.”

When a flying fish falls on the deck of a vessel it may spasmod-
ically and very rapidly move its pectorals upward and downward,
and such a movement may be made while the fish is “on the wing ”
and give the appearance of “ vibration,” so often claimed to be
observed. This action doubtless adds something to the force of the
leap from the water, but it is by no means actual flight.

Tt has been claimed that flving fishes are not often to be seen in
periods of calm and a smooth sea; it is when the winds blow strong
and the waves roll high that most of them make their appearance.
“ Tt is easy to understand how the action of the wind combines favor-
ably or otherwise with their flight.” “As any air in strong motion,
when it impinges against obstacles (a ship’s side or waves) rises, it
raises also the fish, so that this flies over the wave or may come on
board the ship. In short, as Professor Mobius proves in detail, all
the phenomena observed may be fully explained by the combined
action of the oblique projection forward and the wind.” “ Directly
against the wind they commonly fly farther than with the wind, or
when their course and the direction of the wind form an angle
together. Most /’voca@ti which fly against the wind or with the wind
continue, during their whole course of flight, in the direction in which
they come out of the water. Winds coming laterally upon the orig-
inal course of the Hwocati deflect these into their direction.”

Fic. 2.Showing how the flight of the fish is influenced by wind current.

The qualification that the fishes are “ not often to be seen in periods
of calm” of course implies that they may be sometimes. Kneeland
(1870) specifically asserts that he saw them rise “ out of a perfectly
smooth sea.” Whitman (1880), a much more reliable observer, also
had “ often seen great numbers of these fish when the air was almost
motionless—so still that not a ripple could be discovered on the glossy
surface of the water ”—and it even seemed to him * that they were
502 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

not much, if at all, less numerous on such occasions than when there
was a moderate wind.”

Flying fishes rarely fall on board of a ship during the light of
day, but passengers on the old sailing vessels were frequently told
in the morning that fishes had been caught on deck during the night
and would serve as part of their breakfast. According to Mébius,
“they mostly fall upon ships which le not higher than 2 to 3 meters
above water, and when these are sailing on a wind (the wind coming
obliquely from beyond) or with half a wind (the wind coming at
right angles against the ship) and are sailing rapidly. Flying fish
never come on board from the lee side, but always and only from the
weather side.” All those “ which withdraw from ships fly, during
their whole course through the air, near the surface of the water.”

Collingwood (1868) had “known them fly into a cabin through
the open port, attracted by a lhght burning within.” The fact of
entry into the cabin need not be questioned; the inference that it was
deliberate is a nonsequitur.

The flight of a flying fish is never brought to an easy and grace-
ful conclusion like that of a bird, but ends in a fall and with a splash.

Those flying fishes which keep near the coasts and resort to shal-
low water may occasionally, at least, seek and rest on the bottom, as
Goode (1876) has recorded that Cypselurus ewsiliens did. In Ber-
muda he received a small living fish which he kept alive “ for some
hours.” Its “ favorite position was on the bottom of the dish, where
it would remain with its pectorals and ventrals expanded, looking
very like a large butterfly sunning itself on a flower. When dis-
turbed it would feld its fins close to the sides of its body and swim
about with great velocity by rapid, long, sweeping strokes of the
tail and posterior half of the body. The extent to which it flexed
its body was quite remarkable, almost reminding one of the motions
of a shark. When much excited it would rise into the air with a
sudden spring, its pectorals expanded, seeming to have no difficulty
in leaving the water in a space less than a foot in diameter.”

Flight, indeed, must be considered as only an occasional exercise of
flying fishes, and the normal condition must be one of rest or quies-
cence alternating with natation, which may frequently be extended
into emergence from the water or flight. For economical purposes
the fishes are looked for in the water and in the water are caught, as
will be seen by the notices respecting their capture given in subse-
quent paragraphs of this article.

II.

The food of the flying fishes consists of such animal organisms as
occur in the seas which they frequent. ‘They are numerous crusta-
ceans, some mollusks, such as Pteropods and Janthinids, and various
FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS. 508

small fishes. The fishes are, in fact, almost omnivorous, as may be
understood from the means of capture used by professional fisher-
men and anglers.

Their procreative characteristies are very little known. Accounts
are contradictory, but 1t may be because there is a difference in this
respect between different species or even different shoals. Mathew
(1873) was “inclined to fancy ” that they spawned “in mid-ocean,”
for he had “seen them not an inch long more than 1,000 miles from
the nearest land, and these minute specimens when in the air bear a
strong resemblance to locusts on the wing.” Many young have been
observed and collected by others in mid-ocean. There is, in fact, little
if any, doubt that some do spawn far from land. Howard Saunders,
an excellent ornithologist, however, found large shoals about rocks
and inferred that they were there to spawn (1874). ‘“ At the Chincha
Tslands, on the coast of Peru,” Saunders observed numbers of an un-
identified species make “their appearance about the last week in
March, and the water round the rocks was alive with them, the nu-
merous fissures and crevices seeming all too few for their require-
ments. Looking down through the clear water,’ he “could see a
moving mass struggling for places, and, respecting a long narrow rift,
one of the sailors remarked that it was * just like the pit on boxing
night.’ As many as were wanted “could be taken with the hand
from the fissures in the rocks.” At the time Saunders “ never noticed
these flying fish ‘on the wing,’” and inferred that ‘“ doubtless they
were too heavy.” 4

The author of an article on “ flying fish catching in Barbados,” con-
tributed to Chambers’s Journal (1894), claims that there is “ no doubt
that they deposit their ova in the massive banks of ‘ Sargasso
[| =Sargassum] bacciferum,’ or Gulf-weed, which is met with in such
vast quantities as to impede a vessel’s progress through it. Through
the pleasant groves and avenues of these floating forests the young
try in millions disport in comparative security.” The author claims
also to have “ often amused ” himself “ by catching the young fry
thrown up with piles of Gulf-weed on the beach and seen masses
of the spawn, like huge bunches of white currants, entangled among
its close-knit fronds.” These bunches were probably from the Anten-
narioid mouse-fish (Pterophryne histrio), and the young fry may
have been misidentified.

aMr. F. A. Lucas writes to me that “in regard to the flying fish, H.rocoetus, my
experience at the Chincha Islands was similar to that of Mr. Saunders except
that I did not find them so abundant. I saw them in the water and caught
some with the grains, but neyer saw one fly there.”
504 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

Whatever may be the facts respecting the places selected for
spawning, the eggs of flying fishes are undoubtedly like those of their
relatives. Some eggs obtained near Naples in June and July, 1894,
were identified as those of an exocoetine, and described by F.
Raffaele. They were found attached to floating bodies (straws that
had been used for packing fruit) from which they hung like pigmy
grapes. They had characteristic filaments, not very unlike those of
Scomberesox.

The early post-embryonic stages are unknown, but undoubtedly it
will be found that the pectoral fins at first are short and that their
large size is acquired some time after birth. |

Flying fishes are beset by enemies in the form of large pelagic
fishes, such as dolphins, tunnies, bonitos, and albicores, as well as
sharks and porpoises. In order to help them escape, the develop-
ment of the power to leave the water has resulted, and most of the
near relatives of the flying fishes which could not acquire the power
have long since ceased to live, for the nearest living relatives belong
to other groups—the Sauries and Half-beaks. The pursuing fishes
are as swift and active in the water as the flying fishes, and even
escape from the water serves often only to delay capture, for the
pursuing fish may catch one as it falls from the air. The history of
a shoal of flying fishes pursued by one of dolphins would be an
interesting as well as tragic one. Is pursuit ever continued till the
shoal is exterminated or a few escape through their insignificance in
the vast waste of water?

There is another phase of danger, attributed in many a popular
work, from which the flying fish are practically—that is, generally—
exempt. The danger is often represented as twofold, a piscine
Charybdis and an avine Scylla. But danger from birds in the air
is almost nothing.

It must not be supposed, because a shoal of flying fishes is observed
at sea with many in the air at one time, that pursuers are necessarily
in the rear. Notwithstanding the statements of some travelers, the
fishes may be unmolested, and their aerial excursions may be merely
the manifestation of exuberance of spirit and in obedience to an
instinct which impels not only them but all their distant relations—
the sauries, halfbeaks, and garfishes—to leap from the water. Pos-
sibly a school may enjoy a lifetime free from molestation.

IF. Mathew, “during long voyages in the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans,” had many “ opportunities of closely observing the habits of
flying fish,” but he had never “ seen a bird of any description attempt
to seize them while in the air,” nor was he “ acquainted with anyone
who has witnessed such a thing.” He knew of “no bird that could
FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS. d05

manage to catch them. The various species of albatross, petrels,
gulls, skuas, and shearwaters are either too slow on the wing or too
small.” While it is not impossible that birds may occasionally pur-
sue fishes, such attacks must be quite exceptional and not habitual, as
popular accounts would lead the reader to suppose. Such stories
have been repudiated also by Saunders (1874), Pascoe (1881), and
the Earl of Pembroke.

Nevertheless. flying fishes, under some circumstances, can be caught
by birds and are caught in numbers. Collingwood, in his * Ram-
bles of a Naturalist” (1868), records a notable case. ‘ Pratas
Island” is a coral islet of the China Sea (latitude 20° 42’ north,
longitude 116° 43’ east), “ about a mile and a half long and half a mile
wide,” frequented by numerous gannets and, on examining the food
vomited by disturbed birds, Collingwood “ found it to consist invari-
ably of flying fish, generally of a large size, and usually but slightly
digested. There were sometimes six or seven of these fish, in other
cases only three or four, in two or three cases a squid or two inter-
mixed with them.” Yet “ not a single fish was observed on the wing ”
near the islet. The ingested fishes “ were probably taken in the water
by the birds.”

V.

Flying fishes are of considerable gastronomic importance and are
regarded by most of those who have tried them as very savory and
surpassed by few others. Perhaps the best known to epicures are the
Cypselurus speculiger (long known as the Hvocetus volitans) and
the Cypselurus californicus. The palatability of the former was
appreciated at Barbados by the writer, and Jordan and Everman have
declared the latter to be “an excellent food fish, sometimes taken by
the thousand off Santa Barbara.” On account of their mode of
occurrence, however, regular fisheries are entirely exceptional.

One region, the island of Barbados, is quite celebrated on account
of the numbers of a species of flying fish just mentioned (Cypselurus
speculiger) that occur in the vicinity. It is “so abundant in some
seasons of the year,” says R. H. Schomburgk (1848), “ that they con-
stitute an important article of food, and during the season a large
number of small boats are occupied in fishing.” “ Such large num-
bers are occasionally caught that they meet with no sale and are
thrown away or used as manure.” They form a staple in the way of
fish for the island and every visitor during the proper season is ad-
vised to try the flying fish and, heeding, does not repent. ‘“ The suc-
culent delicacy of the fish is certainly a thing to remember.” So
records a writer in Chambers’s Journal (1894).

The fishing grounds are “little more than 10 or 12 miles from

.
506 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

home,” some not more than 5. “ There are about 200 boats engaged
in the fishery. Nowise notable for grace of form or elegance of rig,
they are substantial, undecked vessels of from 5 to 15 tons capacity,
built in the roughest manner, and furnished in the most primitive
way. The motive power is a gaff mainsail and jib and a couple of
sweeps for calms. * * * The fleet leaves the ‘ canash’ (harbor)
before daybreak, each skipper taking his own bearings and working
for the spot which he thinks will furnish the best results. * * *
The tackle used is of the simplest kind. A wooden hoop 8 feet in
diameter, to which is attached a shallow net with inch meshes; a
bucketful of—well, not to put too fine a point on it—stinking fish;
a few good lines and hooks, and a set of grains, form the complete
layout. * *, * As soon as the boat is hove to and her way
stopped, the usual exuberant spirits and hilarious laughter are put
and kept under strong restraint, for a single sound will often scare
away all fish in the vicinity and no more be seen that day. The fish-
erman leans far over the boat’s side, holding the hoop diagonally in
one hand. The other hand, holding one of the malodorous fish
before mentioned, is dipped into the sea, and the bait squeezed into
minute fragments. This answers a double purpose; it attracts the
fish, and the exuding oil forms a ‘ sleep’ or glassy surface all around,
through which one can see to a great depth. Presently sundry black
specks appear far down; they grow larger and more numerous, and
the motionless black man hanging over the gunwale scarcely breathes.
As soon as a sufficient number are gathered he gently sweeps the net
downward and toward the boat withal, bringing it up to, the surface
by drawing it up against the side. Often it will contain as many
fish as a man can lift; but so quietly and swiftly is the operation per-
formed that the school is not startled, and it very often happens that
a boat is filled (that is, 7,000 er 8,000 fish) from one school. More
frequently, however, the slightest noise, a passing shadow, will alarm
the school; there is a flash of silvery light, and the water is clear, not
a speck to be seen. Sometimes the fleet will return with not 1,000
fish among them, when prices will range very high until next day,
when, with 50 or 60 boats bringing 5,000 or 6,000 each, a penny will
purchase a dozen.”

This mode of catching flying fishes has been in vogue in Barbados
for a couple centuries. G. Hughes (1750) observed that “ when
full grown and in perfection ” they “ will neither fly out of [man’s]
way, as they do from the dolphin, nor will they dive into the deep,
but suffer themselves to be taken up with the hand or with a small
hoop net, which is the common and most expeditious way of taking
them.”

The mode of fishing thus described is designated by the Barba-

dians as “ driving ” and is one of the three special ways of taking the
FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS. 507

three principal market fishes of Barbados, the others being “ snap-
pering” for the snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) and “ brimming ”
for the brim or bream (/’telés oculatus). According to a report of
the West India royal commission of 1897, “the flying-fish season
extends over about seven months—from December to July. After
July ” the fishes “* become poor in size and quality and develop what
are known to the fishermen as ‘ feathers,’ but are probably some kind
of parasite,” probably the crustacean Penella, “ which infests their
bodies and renders them unfit for food.”

The royal commission of 1897 reported that “an average catch
may be put down at 1,000 to 1,500 fish, but it not unfrequently hap-
pens that the take reaches as high a figure as 5,000. The heaviest
catches are made in April and May. At such times the supply
sometimes exceeds the demand, when great quantities are wasted or
merely used as manure. The average quantity landed monthly at
Bridgetown fish market in a good season is 390,000, and the average
price obtained may be put down at the rate of 150 fish for one dollar.
The owner of a boat takes a third of the whole catch; the remaining
two-thirds is divided among the hands. The building and fitting of a
ilying fish boat is about $150, and the annual outlay in repairs, ete.,
amounts to about $30.”

Flying fishes might be regarded as unlikely subjects for fly an-
gling, but Francis Smith (1875) experimented with gratification to
himself. ‘“ The monotony of a sea cruise was pleasantly broken on
the 25th of January by an occurrence so unusual as to excite the
wonder of the oldest sailors. Off the coast of Peru a large shoal of
flving fish appeared and afforded excellent sport during the after-
noon. <A variety of baits were employed in their capture—bits of
red bunting, small spoon baits, and artificial minnows and flies—the
most taking being a large red fly and a small gilt minnow, but all the
baits mentioned caught some. In following the minnow through the
water, the fish would open both pectoral fins and poise themselves
for a rush at it; spreading the wings also had the effect of checking
their progress if their suspicions were aroused by a near inspection
of the bait. When hooked they proved a very game fish, taking out
several yards of line in their first rush, and often taking a flight in
the air, line and all.”

VI.

The many species of the exoccetine flying fishes naturally appear
under many modifications of varying significance and have been
segregated in six genera. Four may be diagnosed here.

Most of them have the snout short and the lower jaw more or less
obtuse, the pectorals elongate and extensible nearly or quite to the
caudal, the ventrals inserted behind the middle of body and extensible
508 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

beyond the first rays of anal; further, the ventrals are acutely elon-
gated at the third ray and the first two short and compressed. The
species so distinguished are combined in the genus Cypselurus.

A few species agreeing in most respects with the Cypseluri differ in
the insertion of the ventral fins in advance of the middle of the body
as well as in their brevity; the fins are also truncate or emarginate
and very short, not extending to the anus; the pectorals are moder-
ately elongate. They constitute the genus Hwocwtus and the only
species of the entire group (/. volitans) known to Linneus is one.

A few other species agreeing fundamentally with the Hwoca@ti have
the ventrals submedian and rather short but angulated by the exten-
sion of the third ray; the pectorals are moderately long; further-
more, the roof of the mouth is more dentigerous, the vomer, palatines,
and pterygoids being armed with teeth. These have been set apart
in a genus called Parexocetus, the type of which is the P. mento of
the Indian and Sunda-Moluccan seas. An American species is the
T. hillianus of the Caribbean Sea.

One species is separated from all others by the pike-like head, the
snout being longer than the postorbital region and the lower jaw
elongated, projecting in front and with a flat, triangular area; the
pectorals are moderately elongated, the ventrals rather short and
rounded behind. The single species is the Modiator acutus of the
tropical American seas.

The differences thus indicated are coincident with others.

The Dactylopterids, otherwise known as Flying Gurnards or Fly-
ing Gurnets, differ radically and in innumerable characters from the
true Gurnards, and vastly more from the Exoccetoid flying fishes, but
a few external ones will suffice to give an idea of the family. The
elongated body is somewhat swollen upward under the first dorsal,
and covered with hard-keeled scales; the head is oblong and parallel-
opiped, and the suprascapular bones form an integral part of the
skull, and extend far back as flat spiniform processes on each side of
the dorsal fin; the preoperculum of each side is armed at its angle
with a long horizontal spine reaching backward under the pectoral ;
the jaws have granular teeth; the branchial apertures are con-
tracted ; the dorsal fins short, as is also the anal; the pectorals divided
into two parts, a small anterior and a very large posterior, which
spread out sideways; the ventrals imperfect and not far apart. The
pectorals are set upon osseous bases (actinosts) differentiated for the
two parts.

FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS. 509

As almost every external feature is characteristic, so are many
internal parts. In connection with the longitudinal arch or convex-
ity of the back, so different from the straightness of that of the Gur-
nards, a very remarkable deviation of the air bladder from normal
relations is noteworthy; the dorsal curvature, indeed, is a coordinate
of an otherwise unexampled position of the bladder.

The air, or swimming, bladder is unique in character, as Calder-
wood states, in that “it is not situated below, but [mostly] above,
the vertebral column, not forming part of the abdominal contents,
but situated dorsally in a special cavity [recess] of its own. When
the abdominal cavity is opened ventrally, and the viscera removed,
only the ventral surface of the bladder is seen, forming part of the
dorsal boundary of the cavity. Seen from this point of view, it is
formed of a broad central portion, white and tendinous, and of two
lateral portions strongly muscular.” The physiological significance
of this comes into view when
we consider one of the habits Pa
or aptitudes of the fish.

The structure and position art
of the air-bladder are adapt-
ed for keeping the Dactylop-
terid with back upward in
the air in spite of the form
of the body and its relation
to the vertebral axis. ‘“ The
bladder, being prevented

pressure from the surround- (Adter Bouleriger)
ing water is suddenly re-
moved, the high dorsal position of the secondary portion becomes of
the greatest possible advantage.” It helps the fish to emerge from
the water and maintain its equilibrium in the air.

Such are the most characteristic features of the Dactylopterids com-
mon to all the members of the family. The species are few—about
half a dozen—and closely related to each other, all being strictly
congeneric.

It might naturally be supposed that fishes so specialized in form,
so peculiar in appearance, and so remarkable for the development of
their pectoral fins and their unusual functions, would have received
distinctive English names, but such is not the case. Flying gurnards
or flying gurnets are the general names given in most works, but
they are mere book names and not of the common people; further,
the names are deceptive and have often misled, for the fishes are not
very closely related to the true gurnards or gurnets, although more
so than to any other fishes. Bat-fish is a designation for the common

510 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

Dactylopterid of the Atlantic in Barbados, and Cook (or Cooke)
is another peculiar to Jamaica. The former name, however, is better
known in connection with the strange pediculate fish, J/althe ves-
pertilio, and the latter (Cook) is the specific term of a wrasse in
England and of species of Holocentrids (/Tolocentrus and Myripris-
tis) in Barbados.

The most common species, or at least the most generally known,
and the only one certainly ascertained to be an inhabitant of the
Atlantic Ocean, is the Dactylopterus volitans. The best and fullest
account of its habits has been given by R. Schmidtlein (1879), who
had good opportunities to observe it in the tanks of the zoological
station at Naples. A translation from the German of the greater
part of his observations is interwoven into the following account.

The appearance of the living fishes, as it appeared to Schmidtlein,
is thus described :

The flying gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans) occurs about Naples
in great numbers, principally in the autumn and until the late win-
ter, and approaches very close to the gurnards as regards its habits.
Its appearance is very peculiar and suggestive of its mode of life.
The bony cap which, like a stiff mask, incloses the skull, gives to it
a peculiar physiognomy from which, however, the bull-like feature
of the gurnards (7'rigla) is absent, because the eyes are placed later-
ally and the snout declines abruptly from the frontal. The result
is a well-formed head of the right proportion to the size of the body,
and from which the large, round eyes with red irises are moved in
a jerky manner and look out with a wondering expression. To
this armored part of the body is joined the nearly conical trunk,
covered with hard scales and with a complete equipment of fins.
First come the pectorals which are modified into large organs for
flying and provided in their anterior portion with short individually
movable rays which, however, are connected by a membrane. Be-
hind the throat are the ventrals which have been advanced forward ;
they are for the most part folded and directed downward. The
dorsals are delicate and provided with a glass-like transparent
membrane.

The coloring of the fish appears at a distance and superficially as
a mixture of dark tints, but is found to contain, on closer examina-
tion, a great quantity of many-colored markings. The back is col-
ored a beautiful brown, with dark spots and bands. The sides, as
far as the middle of the belly, are pale rose, with silvery reflections,
and the outspread wings show in the center rows of black and light
eye-like spots, which recall the coloring of tropical butterflies by
their markings and gay tints, together with the magnificent blue
with which they are hemmed in. This beautiful sight may be espe-

cially enjoyed when looking at the fishes from above in the sunlight
or in the broad daylight, while inducing them to unfold their wings
by holding a stick close to them. Then golden green specks appear
all over the body; at every motion the fins play in all colors in dif-
ferent places, like the wings of the butterfly known as the purple
emperor, and also the gay mingling of beautifully distributed tints
on head and back contribute to the splendor of the brilliant creature.
Besides, Dactylopterus possesses the faculty of changing its colors
to light or dark. This is particularly fortunate for the young ones,
where the bottom is similarly colored, as, because of their small size,
they are more exposed to the attacks of enemies. It has also been
observed that the young flying gurnards far more commonly stay
on the bottom of the basin than the larger fishes, and here harmonize
splendidly with the sand, especially where it is mixed with multi-
colored gravel. Furthermore, the coloring of such specimens is
also less pronounced and the markings are darker, more monotonous,
and frequently indistinct. At dusk the fishes are often scarcely
visible.

The adult Dactylopterids lke to stay on the bottom of their basins,
where they stand and walk about on the ends of their downward-
turned ventrals hke the Gurnards do on their * legs,” while they wag
their dorsal fin and tail and scratch in the sand with the short ante-
rior portion of the pectoral to look for food. They are gregarious
and swim about in a body, even when in company with other fishes.
They show great resemblance to the Gurnards in their movements
and in the use of their fins, and what has been said with regard to the
Gurnards in this respect is applicable to the Dactylopterids, with the
exception that the latter swim somewhat more slowly and leisurely,
and possess a stronger inclination for flying than the former. Their
power of flying may not be far behind that of the Exoccetines.

But although at first sight so well adapted for semiaerial life, the
Dactylopterids are nevertheless essentially bottom fishes, or seek rest
on some surface. Sir John Richardson long ago (1865) noted that
*in the clear waters of the Boca Tigris, off Trinidad, great sculls of
these fish may be seen near the bottom, perpetually fluttering their
large wing-like pectorals.” Of course. in mid-ocean some other kind
of resting place must be secured and there the beds of sargasso weed
furnish suitable resorts. But near land they resort to the bottom
at considerable depths, and in temperate regions, on the approach
of winter, retreat to still greater depths to secure a warmer and more
equable temperature.

The power of flight has been attributed to Dactylopterids by most
authors, and is there not a fine colored plate illustrating a school of
them in mid-air in a very popular work on natural history (Brehm’s

‘
ALY FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

Thierleben)? Against this power other authors have pronounced
and denied the fishes any aptitude for aerial progression. On the one
hand, Signor Le Bianco, of the zoological station of Naples, informed
W. L. Calderwood (1889) that “it is met with in the bay at a depth
of from 20 to 60 meters, say 10 to 30 fathoms, but is never seen on the
surface.” (Le Bianco, in an article of his own (1888) had indicated
it as scarcely pelagic (raramente pelagico). On the other hand, some
reliable men and good naturalists have testified to their ability to
emerge from the water and progress for short distances through the
air. Neglecting all observations recorded more than half a century
ago, comparatively recent notices confirm old statements, to some ex-
tent at least.

Richardson, the best informed ichthyologist of the middle of the
last century, also especially testified to their aerial excursions
“'They are able to rise from the water and fly through the air like
the Exocoeti or flying fishes already mentioned. With such force
does the Dactylopterus pursue its flight that it will spring upon the
deck of a ship of war, and it has been known to strike a sailor on the
forehead and knock him down.”

Moseley, the naturalist of the great Challenger Expedition, attested
that * whilst out in a boat collecting animals amongst the gulf weed ”
he saw Dactylopterids around him and “ watched these little flying
fish fly along before the boat at a height of about a foot above the
water for distances of 15 or 20 yards,” and he “chased them and
caught one or two with a hand net amongst the weed.”

Moseley believed that the Dactylopterid had a somewhat different
flight from the Exocoetids. He had “never seen any species of
Fxococtus flap its wings at all during its flight. These fish merely
make a bound from the water,” but he believed he could “not be
mistaken ” in the conviction that he had “ distinctly seen species of
flying gurnets move their wings rapidly during their flight. I
noticed,” says he, ‘ the phenomenon especially in the case of a small
species of Dactylopterus with beautifully colored wings, which
inhabits the Sargasso Sea. Whilst out,in a boat collecting animals
amongst the Gulf weed, these small flying gurnets were constantly
startled by the boat and flew away before it, and as they did so
appeared to me to buzz their wings very rapidly. Their mode of
flight seemed to me to be closely similar to that of many forms of
grasshoppers, which can not fly for any great distance, but raise
themselves from the ground with a spring and, eking out their
momentum as much as they can by buzzing their wings, fall to the
ground after a short flight.

“Doctor Mobius, who similarly watched the flight of a species of
flying gurnards, maintains that neither form of flying fish flap
their wings at all during flight. I no not consider the question as
FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS. Billo

vet set at rest. Of course no flying fish can raise themselves in the
air by means of their wings alone.”

Schmidtlein believed that their power of flying was probably not
far behind that of the Exocoetids, so far as the fishes have been
observed in nature, but in the aquarium experimentation on this
question is not to be thought of. On the contrary, the authorities
of the Naples station have to protect the basin for these fishes with
bars and nets to prevent their escaping, because they would other-
wise fly either through the window into the open air or to either side
into the adjoining tanks. And, as a matter of fact, the station loses
a rather large number of the fishes because they jump out and fall
against the walls, or on the bridge over the aquarium, and perish
there.

II.

The Dactylopterids are naturally carnivorous, but their food is
determined by the size of the mouth and their environments.  Ac-
cording to Schmidtlein, their small mouth permits them to swallow
only small morsels; therefore they lke to take crustaceans, such as
shrimps (Crangon or Crago) and prawns (Palaemon), young crabs,
and tiny fishes, which they find dead on the bottom.

to:

W. P. Calderwood and G. P. Bidder told Ernest Holt (1898) * that
when a Dactylopterus was placed in a tank at Naples containing
some small sharks the latter bit pieces out of its pectorals, a liberty
resented by violent grunting.” It is added that “ g@urnards and
dories also grunt under circumstances of discomfort, the sounds
being of the nature which appears from experiment to be perceptible
by fishes. They may possibly subserve a function which is in part
protective.”

The Dactylopterids emit sounds under certain conditions, both in
the water and out of it. While Calderwood was killing a couple of
specimens “sounds exactly similar to those of the Gurnard were
distinctly heard, and simultaneously with each sound a distinet con-
traction of the bladder could be felt from the exterior. These con-
tractions were quite independent of any movements of the mouth or
operculum.” Schmidtlein never heard the sounds emitted voluntarily
under water, nor observed the movement of the gill covers which
produce them. Experiments relating to this subject were made by
him and details promised for another place, but never published.
The testimony of Calderwood and Bidder, however, supphes the defi-
ciency in Schmidtlein’s observations. .

The sounds thus noticed are produced by the action of four muscles

514 FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS.

upon the air-bladder already noticed. The muscles are two for each
lobe, a large intrinsic and a small extrinsic muscle. The nervous
impulses are communicated to them by the last pair of cerebral nerves.
The intrinsic muscles, by contraction, produce vibratory quiverings
(frémissements) which, reinforced by the bladder, become sonorous
vibrations easily perceptible. These muscles, contracting while
they vibrate, may change the shape of the bladder, stretching or relax-
ing such or such a part of the organ of this flexible sounding-board
(instrument de renforcement), and by such changes modify the
several qualities of sounds. The whole subject has been discussed at
great length by Dufossé in his memoir on the sounds produced by
[uropean fishes, published in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles in
1874. In this article those who may be especially interested in the
subject will find explanatory details. (See especially 5. serie, t. 20,
article 8, pp. 47-51, 67, 68, 76, SO-S4.)

But the air-bladder with its accessories is not the only sound-
producing organ. The peculiar modifications of the suborbital bones
and opercular apparatus are associated with a peculiar function—a
stridulation which may be distinctly heard at a considerable distance.
The pontinal or third suborbital bone is articulated so that it can
be bent at a right angle with the enlarged second, and when the
spiniform preoperculum is flexed outward the little pontinal is
extended across and at a right angle between the reentering angle of
the preopercular sinus and the second suborbital. When the pre-
opercle is depressed and pushed forward and inward, its anterior
articular surface grates upon the hinder angle of the lower jaw, and
a distinct stridulatory sound is produced, reminding one of the
strident notes of orthopterous insects, such as crickets or locusts, and
grasshoppers. Attention was called to this fact and a full explana-
tion given by W. Sorensen in 1884.

Oviposition probably occurs in the spring and the eggs are doubt-
less cast and fertilized near the surface of the water, and there
the earlest days of the fish’s life are spent. The earliest stages are
unknown, but it is in the postlarval growth that the greatest inter-
est is centered. When, or rather before, the young has acquired a
length of a third of an inch, it has a helmet whose posterior processes
reach as far back-as the soft dorsal and the preopercular spines
extend to the anal; at the same time the pectoral fins are short and
entire, and the spinous dorsal little developed. This condition, so
different from that manifest in maturity, continues, but with dimin-
ishing disproportion, till the length of nearly or quite 2 inches has
been attained. Fishes possessing these characters were believed by
the old ichthyologists to represent a peculiar genus, to which the
FLYING FISHES AND THEIR HABITS. 515

apt name Cephalacanthus (spined head) was given. But between
the very little fish and the one about 2 inches long all gradations
occur. With advancing age the spines become more and more
reduced, the pectorals elongated, differentiation of each pectoral
into two distinct parts supervenes, and the spinous dorsal is at length
as large as the soft. The mature or true Dactyloptcrus stage is thus
attained. This condition of maturity, however, may be hastened or
delayed so that it may be attained when the fish is smaller than many
which still have the attributes of immaturity, or it may be delayed
until the fish has reached a length of 2 inches even. The transfor-
mation of the Cephalacanthus into the Dactylopterus, nevertheless,
takes place rapidly at last.

V.

The Dactylopterids are not usually looked upon as game fishes, but
Moseley, while on the Challenger, hooked one at Cape Verde of which
he tells in his Notes by a Naturalist. ‘“ The trammel net was set
nightly in the harbor by Mr. Cox, the boatswain, and yielded some
fine fish. Among these were some flying gurnets, which evidently,
from their being caught in the trammel, frequent the bottom a good
deal like our wingless gurnets. One was caught with a line at the
bottom. I hooked one, however, near the surface, when fishing with
a rod and trout tackle for small mackerel and silver fish. This was
quite a novel experience in fishing. The flying fish darted about like
a trout and then took a good long fly in the air, and in an instant was
down in the water again and out again into the air, and being beyond
my skill in playing with such light tackle, soon shook itself loose and
got free.”

Moseley not only made an attempt on the fish as an angler, but also
as a fowler. As the Challenger. on its way from Ascension Island,
approached Boatswain Bird Island, and “as the vessel steamed along
the shore of the main island, large flying gurnets (Dactylopterus) ,”
it appears from the narrative (p. 298), “ rose, scared by the vessel,
-and skimmed rapidly away in front of the bows. The attempt was
made to shoot them on the wing, a novel experiment, but quite with-
out success. The flight was rapid and the boat was in constant
motion, pitching and rolling; no doubt in calm weather the thing
might be done,” thought the narrator.

The Dactylopterids are naturally quite sensitive to cold. At Na-
ples it was practically impossible to keep a lot through the winter.
According to Schmidtlein, their life is considerably shortened by the
cold of the winter, and it has a very disturbing influence on their
health, makes them sluggish and dull, and but rarely permits a speci-
men to live through the winter months till spring. The fish is, there-
fore, a periodical guest of the aquarium, the supply being renewed
every season.

THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS.¢
By A. DASTRE.

An idea which has gained popular credence, and still hazily lingers
in many cultivated minds, is that man of the present day is descended
from a handsomer, stronger, and more superb ancestral race. In the
course of time, it is said, the powerful sap that nourished the mighty
bodies of our ancestors has, little by little, become corrupted or
exhausted, until debilitated, feeble, and nervous generations have suc-
ceeded the productive, rich-blooded, and exuberant generations of old.

Without going to such an extreme, some students, more positive
and more scientific, think nothing more than that the human body
has undergone a sort of evolution of decline, manifesting itself in a
progressive diminution in size. These ideas, which appear in various
forms, becoming more and more veiled, are nothing else than rem-
nants of an ancient superstition, the belief in giants.

What isa giant? Does it exist? Cana race of giants exist? Has
such a race existed? These are questions that in all times have
excited a lively interest. The imagination of the ancients was fed on
stories in which the heroes were either giants or else mere pygmies.
Even to-day tales about giants enliven our infancy. The reality of
their existence excites such universal curiosity that it should not be
‘ause for wonder that it has given rise to interminable and fruitless
discussions among savants.

Of all these writings—of these innumerable fabulous stories of
combats between giants and gods and the discussions about giants—
nothing worthy of consideration remains. Recent works upon the
subject are of more value. The problem now presents itself in a
more practical aspect than it did to our predecessors. We have
more records than they had; we are in a position to know whether
man’s size has varied in prehistoric and historic times, and whether
there ever existed aggregations of colossal men meriting the appel-
lation “race of giants.” Since it is incontestable that individuals

of gigantic size do appear from time to time, a systematic study of
the subject should be undertaken and would yield invaluable results.
The research begins by investigating the significance and reason for
the existence of these monstrous beings, and ends by learning why
they can not reproduce and perpetuate colossal creatures like them-
selves.

Two sciences, anthropology and medicine, control the study of
the subject, and the progress of our knowledge in the matter is due
to both of them. The present article will deal with the subject
chiefly from the anthropological standpoint, more especially in the
light thrown upon it by contemporaneous anthropological research.
The part which medical science played in explaining the causes of
aberrations from the normal size is sufficiently definite and limited
to warrant separate examination without inconvenience to the
student. A word or two about it here will, therefore, be enough.

Anthropologists have applied the rule and compass to the study
of primitive man, and they have measured in whole and in part the
remains of our ancestors that lived in the geologic ages, the humble
hewers of stone from the Quaternary age up to the dawn of the
present era. Popular fancy exaggerated their size immoderately,
for anthropologists, through the implements of an exact science,
have found that instead of being giants they were men of only
mediocre height. Anthropologists have also unearthed skeletons of
men that lived since the beginning of the historic period, and meas-
urements here, too, have proved that the average height of man
shows no tendency to diminish. Scientists, then, by careful methods
of measurement have furnished evidence in favor of the truth that
Jean Riolan tried to establish as early as the beginning of the seven-
teenth century, and which he clearly expresses in the title of one of
his works published in 1618, Discourse on the Height of Giants,
in which it is shown that in all times, even the most ancient, the
tallest men and the giants were no bigger than the giants of the
present day.

To come back to the bearing of medical science upon the subject,
it is medicine which has most recently thrown hight upon the question
of giants, and medicine maintains that to it belongs the study of
giants in the present day, the rare few that now and then appear.
Giants are men whose development instead of pursuing a normal
course has undergone a morbid deviation, and whose nutrition has
been perverted. They are dystrophic. Their great stature shows
that one part has gained at the loss of another; it is a symptom of
their inferiority in the struggle for existence. Their condition is not
only a variation from the ordinary conditions of development—that
is to say, they are “ congenital monsters,” the study of which belongs
to the science of teratology—but it is a variation also from a state of

THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS. blo

health physiologically and normally sound; that is to say, they are
diseased and fall within the domain of the pathologist. “ Here, then,”
as E. Brissaud says, “-you have your giants despoiled of their ancient
and fabled prestige; mythology yields the place to pathology.”
Such is the new doctrine in its most categoric or most expressive
form.

The imagination of all ancient peoples was haunted by the chimer-
ical vision of a sort of superman, like ordinary man, but bigger and
stronger. These beings of perfect proportion, but of colossal stature,
were giants. The conception has remained firmly fixed in popular
belief, and it has been so general and so deep rooted that the question
must perforce arise whether it did not have some foundation in re-
ality. A priori, one is tempted to see in it the recollection, magnified
by tradition, of a colossal race that actually existed. All mythologies,
in fact, contain legends of giants. Greek mythology represents huge
beings, children of the earth, carrying on formidable conflicts against
the gods who inhabit heaven. The details of the struggle are
recounted in a thousand different ways; now, it is an army of giants
who stand in battle array under the leadership of Alcyoneus and
Porphyrion and await the attack of the inhabitants of Olympus, aided
by the hero Hercules. Another time it is Otus and Ephialtes, who
pile mountain upon mountain to scale heaven and throw burning
rocks against it. But the wars which break out over and over again
always end in the triumph of the king of the gods; and the giants
doomed to inevitable defeat are struck by Jupiter’s thunderbolts,
crushed under the wheels of his chariot, and finally hurled into Tar-
tarus.

Historians and critics who insist that all myths have a significance
symbolic and natural at the same time have no trouble to explain this
one. They find in it a reflection and personification of the subter-
‘anean forces in revolt against the laws of nature—the Greeks said
Divine laws—which require and maintain the solidity and fixity of

the earth. These irregular, tumultuous forces, voleanic eruptions,
earthquakes, violent cataclysms, these agents of destruction proceed-
ing from the bowels of the earth and loosed against the order of the
world; that is, against the gods, all these are giants. It is a remark-
able fact that while the poets in symbolizing these natural forces gave
frightful descriptions of them, endowing them with multiple mem-
bers, with horrible heads, and enormous mouths spitting flames, the
Greek artists, on the contrary, always susceptible to actual forms, rep-
resented them simply with human faces and figures. J*or example, in
a painting on a very ancient vase the giant Anteus is represented
as thrown into a prostrate attitude by Hercules and seeking to touch
the earth with- his hands in order to draw fresh vigor from it. His
body, though that of a man admirably proportioned, is nearly double

.
520 THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS.

that of Minerva, who strikes him with her lance, or that of Hercules,
who draws a bow upon him. Moreover, the hugeness of the body is
itself a rare and exceptional feature in the representations of the
Greek artists, who quickly renounced this significant deformation, so
that in ancient art giants would not have been distinguished from
ordinary human beings if, after the archaic period, the custom had
not arisen of terminating their lower limbs in the bodies of serpents.
A beautiful cameo in the museum at Naples shows Jupiter crushing
under the wheels of his chariot some serpent-footed giants whom he
had already thrown to the ground with his thunderbolt.

Analagous legends have been transmitted to us by the historians of
all the peoples of antiquity. Scholars have collected many references
to giants in the Scriptures and in the writings of profane authors.
Sometimes the huge beings form a whole people, or a tribe, or an
ethnic group, though most frequently they appear in history as excep-
tional individuals. A list of references would be too long to be
given here. It must suffice to mention a few sources of information,
as Etudes biologiques sur les géans (Masson, 1904), by P. E. Launois
and P. Roy. Buffon in his work on the natural history of man gives
some information obtained from the Memoir of Lecat read in his
day at the academy of Rouen. It is there recalled that the Greeks
attributed to Orestes a height of 114 feet, which Pliny consented to
reduce to 7 cubits or 104 feet. He also mentions the skeletons of Sec-
ondilla and of Pusio, preserved in the gardens of Sallust. These
could not have measured less than 10 feet. In our time Prof. C.
Taruffi, of Bologna, in his work (Milan, 1878) on gigantism—which
he calls macrosomy—collected a vast number of records which show
that the general belief has threaded history that modern man is the
dwindled, degenerate offspring of ancestors of gigantic stature.
From this point of view the isolated specimens of giants that appear
at long intervals would be accidental repetitions of a vanished type,
belated representatives of an extinct race.

This universal, deeply rooted prejudice rests upon evidence so
manifold and so categoric that it might easily influence all but the
scientifically equipped critic, and it is not until relatively recent
times that the man of science himself has been in a position to discuss
the evidence and cast doubt upon the belief. It may be of some value
to recall that ideas upon the subject even in the nineteenth century
were still sufficiently indeterminate for Silberman to feel justified in
raising the question, in 1859, before the Academy of Sciences, as to
whether the human body has varied in size within historic times.
He answered the question in the negative. He affirmed that the stat-
ure of the Egyptians had not changed since the construction of the
pyramids; but some uncertainty attaches to the calculations made by
him for arriving at the height of the contemporaries of the king
THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS. 591

Cheops in order to SOU Ee their size with that of the present
generation.

The same uncertainty does not characterize the methods of modern
anthropometry. Only limited faith is placed in the evidence of his-
torians, geographers, or voyagers, and none but scientific measurements
‘an be relied upon. The stature of vanished populations is obtained
directly by measuring their skeletons or parts of their skeletons, the
relations of which to the whole have been established by previous
study and careful research. No one has gone further than IL.
Manouvrier in determining precisely the relation, long ignored, that
exists between the various parts of a skeleton. For the use of
anthropologists he codified after a fashion the rules outlined of old
by Orfila and revised by Topinard and E. Rollet in France, by
Humphry and J. Beddoe in England, and by Langer and Toldt in
Germany. He made a sort of chart for ready reckoning, by the aid of
which, from the dimensions of the femur or the tibia, we can deduce
the height and the size of the body itself. The degree of approxi-
mation of the results is known, the extent of the extreme aberrations,
the causes of the aberrations, and all the conditions, in short, for
reducing the aberrations to a minimum. In these means of investi-
gation contemporaneous anthropology has weapons with which to
attack the prejudices that have long existed in regard to the gigantic
stature of our far-removed ancestors and in regard to the pretended
diminution in size which the human figure has been progressively
undergoing.

Errors and exaggerations such as these have been collected, trans-
mitted, and propagated by historians of all times. The first expres-
sion that they received is incontestably to be found in the Bible.
The Hebrew scriptures allude in various passages to enormous
men—as, for example, the population found by the spies of Moses
in the Promised Land. The prophet Amos compares these occu-
pants of Canaan to oaks for strength and to cedars for height. The
simile forcibly recalls almost the very words of the Poeémes Barbares,

in which the hordes of primitive men are described as they issue from
dark woods and limitless deserts:
More massive than the cedar, taller than the pine.

In the Book of Kings the giant Goliath is said to have been 11
feet 4 inches tall; and Deuteronomy narrates that the iron bed of Og,
the King of Bashan, was 9 cubits, or about 15 feet, long. All the
Jews, however, did not entertain blind faith in the accuracy of these
figures, and many of them questioned how gigantic races, so power-
filly built, could have completely disappeared. The prince of
scribes, Esdras, who edited the canonical books at the end of the
Babylonian exile and freed them of errors that had crept into them,
pleads the progressive debasement of the race. Succeeding gener-
Nyy THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS.

ations grow smaller and smaller; and so the colossal statures of the
first men have dwindled to frailer forms. The opinion of Esdras
appears among all peoples and in all histories of later times. The
Greeks expressed the same idea of physical decadence, of a falling
away from the grand stature of personages in the heroic age. Homer
and Hesiod lament the decline, and, later, Herodotus, Pausanias, and
Philostrates speak of it in a similar strain. Plutarch finally goes so
far as to hken the men of his time to infants in comparison with
the ancients. Among the Romans the same conception is found. Re-
call the lines of Virgil when the laborer with his plow turns up the
bones and arms of his ancestors: “* He gazes astounded on the gigan-
tic bones that start from their broken sepulchers.” Pliny in his
natural history expresses even more extreme ideas in this regard.
He mentions the discovery in a mountain of Crete of a human skele-
ton 6 cubits long, or more than 20 meters.

The moderns have had the same notions concerning the diminution
of man’s size. The historians of the Norse lands in many a passage
celebrated the huge stature of the ancient inhabitants of Scan-
dinavia.

Belief in the former colossal height of man and his continued de-
cline in size through the ages seemed to be verified by the discovery
of huge bones in ancient tombs. Lecat mentions tombs in which
were found bones of giants 15, 20, 30, and 32 feet tall. But in his
day scholars were no longer dupes of such evidence. It was known
at the time—that is, in the second half of the eighteenth century—
that the enormous bones were not those of human beings, but of
large animals. In the opinion of Buffon they belonged to a horse
or an elephant; for, he says, at one time warriors were buried with
their war horses, and so, possibly, with their war elephants. But
in less enlightened times, the bones were taken to be those of immense
giants and were venerated as such. Sometimes they were exposed
at cathedral doors. According to Langer, cited by Launois and Roy,
one could see an exhibition of this nature under the porch of the
chapel of the castle at Cracow as late as 1872. It was composed of
a mastodon’s bone, the skull of a rhinoceros, and one of the jawbones
of a whale.

Of all these finds the most celebrated on account of the discussions
to which it gave rise was made in 1613 near Romans, Dauphiné,
by workmen engaged in digging sand. Near a building of brick they
unearthed a skeleton 25 feet long. Now, it was pretended that a dis-
covery of medallions bearing the image of Marius had been made in
the neighborhood; and these two events suiliced as ground for the
supposition that the bones were those of the giant Teutobochus, king
of the Teutons, who had been conquered by Marius, near Aix, in 102
B. C, and had died soon after. Jean Riolan, physician and skillful
THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS. 523

anatomist, said that it was an imposture to attribute the bones to
Teutobochus. Other mer, like Guillemeau, royal surgeon, and Nico-
las Habicot defended the theory, and a controversy rich in incident
lasted five years. The belief, which even in the time of Buffon seemed
to lack the marks of verisimilitude, was not finally dissipated until
De Blainville, in May, 1835, declared to the Academy of Sciences that
the bones attributed to Teutobochus were those of a mastodon iden-
tical with mastodons previously found in Ohio.

For lack of populations of real giants, that is, men whose enormous
stature separated them by a sort of hiatus from the tallest men one
ordinarily sees, modern explorers have brought to our knowledge two
‘races of men who are very tall without being inordinately so. They
are called pseudo-giants. The two groups, representing the type of
the tallest men on the globe, are the Patagonians of America and the
Polynesians.

The Patagonians are especially interesting. Magellan was the first
to see them, in 1519, on the strait called by his name, between Terra
del Fuego and the American continent. Once during the five months
of winter that he was forced to pass in this region, which he thought
uninhabited, the Spaniards were visited by a native, come without
doubt from some distance. He was gay, vigorous, confident, and he
did not hesitate to go on board the vessel. In the written account of
the voyage, the height of this savage is described as having been so
great that the head of an average-sized man in the crew reached only
to his waist. He was stout in proportion, his strength was consider-
able, and his appetite commensurate with his size. Having been well
treated, he soon brought some of his companions of his own propor-
tions. Magellan gave them the name of Patagonians.

If this description were to be taken absolutely literally, the Pata-
gonians must have been about 83 feet tall. Elsewhere, it is true, the
author of the narrative ascribes to the natives only 7 feet 6 inches.
It is interesting and instructive to note the variety of estimates made
of their height by voyagers who have seen them. Magellan accords
them 74 feet; Commodore Byron 7 feet; the Dutchman Sebald de
Noort 10 to 11 feet. Smaller size, however, is attributed to them by
Commerson, traveling companion to M. de Bougainville and the
Prince of Nassau. He says their height is not much greater than that
of the average-sized Frenchman, usually from 5 feet 8 inches to 6
feet; none exceeded 6 feet 4 inches. This is far from being gigantic,
as Commerson remarks, and he comes out very strongly against the
fables and les related concerning these pretended Titans. He is
right. The Patagonians are men of great size, but they are by no
means giants. Topinard, who forty years ago measured a fairly
large number of their skeletons, assigns to them a height of 1.78m.

The general run of anthropologists admit the division of races or
524 THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS

peoples into four groups, according to their average height. The
first group is that of the “ tall-bodied.” ranging from the English
(1.703 meters), the shortest among them, to the Tehuelches of Pata-
gonia (1.781 meters), the tallest, and including the Scotch (1.710
meters), the Scandinavians (1.713 meters), the Negroes of Guinea
(1.724 meters), and the Polynesians (1.762 meters). The second group
is of those “ above the average ” (1.65 meters to 1.70 meters), which,
beginning with the French (1.650 meters) at the bottom of the scale,
comprises the Russians (1.660 meters), the Germans (1.677 meters),
the Belgians (1.684 meters), and the Irish (1.697 meters). The size
of the third group, that is, of those below the average, ranges from
1.65 meters downward to 1.60 meters, and includes, among others,
the Hindoos (1.642 meters), the Chinese (1.63 meters), the Italians
of southern Italy, and the Peruvians. The last group is that of the
“ short-bodied,” which includes, among others, the Malays and the
Lapps.

The Patagonians, then, are only tall men, but they “ hold the rec-
ord,” which fact, however, has been disputed, first, in favor of a popu-
lation on the Upper Nile, the Dikas; next in favor of the Polynesians,
then the Scandinavians, and last, the Scotch.

To recapitulate: There actually exists, then, no population or
ethnic group of giants. Specimens of giants do appear, but only in
isolated, individual, and accidental cases. Since physicians at the
present time liken gigantism to a malady, we may say (from now on
borrowing their language) that this disease is nowhere endemic, that
it manifests itself a ttle everywhere, but in sporadic cases under
the influence of conditions yet to be determined. !

So much for the question of gigantism in present times. But the
question is not one of the present; it is the past that perplexes, and it
is the past with which we are concerned.

cir:

As we have seen, it is in the past, in the long-distant past, in which
tradition has placed the origin of a race of giants, who have subse-
quently undergone a process of progressive degradation. This thesis
has been adopted by a fair number of writers more or less qualified to
judge of the matter. Some of them, hke Henrion in 1718, even ven-
tured to draw up a table giving in positive figures the series of degra-
dations undergone by the human stature in the course of time, from
Adam, said to have been 123 feet (40 meters), Abraham, 27 feet (9
meters), and Hercules, 10 feet (about 3 meters), to Alexander the
Great, 64 feet (nearly 2 meters), and Cesar, 5 feet (1.62 meters).
These figures are so absolutely puerile and fantastic that they do not
merit attention.

It is the task of anthropometry to try to estimate man’s size in the
THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS. 525

various epochs of history as well as in prehistoric times and geologic
ages. For this it is necessary to arrive at some sure method of calcu-
lating the real size of the living being from his skeleton, or from
fragments of his skeleton, found in the deposits of the Tertiary or
Quaternary periods or in the sepulchers of historic times. The estab-
lishment of such a method of mensuration has for many years occu-
pied L. Manouvrier, and it constitutes one of his best titles to a seien-
tific reputation. The basic work that he published on the subject
appeared in 1892; and recently, in 1902, he crowned his efforts, as it
were, by issuing a study “upon anthropometric relations and the
principal proportions of the body” (sur les rapports anthropomé-
triques et sur les principales proportions du corps). The memoir is
of great interest to natural history in general. Parts of it are well
worthy the attention of artists, painters, and sculptors, whose clas-
sical canons, perhaps a bit factitious, ought to be submitted to the
control of the science of man as he really is.

The results of the investigations made by L. Manouvrier can be
expressed in a word. They have proved that man’s stature has not
undergone any important regular variation during the hundreds of
thousands of years that have rolled by since his first appearance upon
the globe. So far as one can judge from the isolated specimens
brought to hght by excavations, the stature of man has undergone no
appreciable change. In this regard civilized man is the same as
primitive man.

The study of animals has led to similar conclusions. In general,
the body of animals of a certain species or of a certain variety is not
modified; or if it is modified, the change has causes by no means dis-
playing the character of a chronologic evolution. Geoffroy Saint-
Hilaire, in order to show that man’s stature has not necessarily
changed since geologic times, based his argument upon precisely this
fact, that the body of a domesticated animal species is identical with
that of the wild species.

EY,

The furthest removed ancestor of man seems to be the famous
Pithecanthropus erectus. In the course of the years 1891 and 1892,
as may be remembered, a physician in the Dutch army, Eugene Du-
bois, discovered near Trinil, on the island of Java, some bones of puz-
zling appearance and with characteristics intermediate between those
of a man and those of an anthropoid ape. There, in a deposit un-
doubtedly of the Tertiary epoch, was a complete skull, a femur, and
two molars.

Simple as were these remains, they nevertheless sufficed for assign-
ing to its proper place and rank in the animal hierarchy the being
from which they came. It belongs between the anthropoid ape, the
526 THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS.

gibbon, and man himself. The femur, whose form indicates adapta-
{ion to an erect posture, reveals man; the skull, whose capacity is
too small for man but a little too large for an ape, reveals a superior
anthropoid. The remains were in a state of fossilization corre-
sponding to their antiquity and permitting them to be handled with-
out danger of breaking them. They were exhibited throughout
Europe and submitted to the examination of all competent anato-
mists—Krause, Waldeyer, Virchow, Luschan, Nehring, in Germany;
Milne Edwards, E. Perrier, Filhol, in France; Cuningham and
Turner, in England.

At Berlin the scholars brought into prominence reasons why the
anthropopithecus could not be a man; at London they showed why it
could not be an ape. So nothing was left the transformists but the
conclusion that the creature, which was neither a man nor an ape,
must be both at the same time, and that it constituted the transition
stage from ape to man, the “ missing link” of the chain that binds
the human to the animal kind. E. Dubois assigned a height of 1.70
meters to the anthropopithecus; the estimate of M. Manouvrier is
somewhat less. The length of the femur permits us to attribute a
height of about 1.65 meters, the average height of the European, to
this precursor, this original ancestor of man.

After measuring skeletons of the Tertiary epoch, as was done by
M. Manouvrier, it was necessary to do the same for those of the
Quaternary epoch. The task was undertaken by M. Rahon.t The
most ancient specimen of that period is the skeleton of Neanderthal,
found in 1857 in a limestone cave of Neanderthal, between Diissel-
dorf and Elberfeld. The first measurements, made by Professor
Schaafhausen, showed that the relative proportions of the members
were those of a European of average size or a little below the average.
Schaafhausen determined the height to be 1.601 meters; Rahon’s
estimate, 1.613 meters, is almost the same.

It would be idle to give in detail similar measurements made of all
the human bones of the Quaternary period that MM. Manouvrier and
Rahon had before them either in the original or in casts. They com-
puted the height of the man of Spy to be 1.610 meters, that of the
man found in the clay of Lahr 1.720 meters. The latter, as is appar-
ent, belonged to the group of “ tall-bodied ” men. The troglodyte of
Chancelade, found in the more recent strata of Quaternary soil, was
1.612 meters, the crushed man of Laugerie 1.669 meters. The aver-
age for the four cases is 1.652 meters.

These figures would indicate but a moderate size in our distant
ancestors, who were contemporaries of the cave bear and chased the

mammoth and the rhinoceros of the chambered nostrils. They in no
wise resemble the colossal beings created by popular fancy and de-
scribed by the poets as “more massive than the cedar and taller than
the pine.” Nor were they “ stronger than the oak.” They lived more
or less miserably. The men of the quaternary period had already
begun to be industrious and they fashioned implements of roughly
hewn stone. This was the beginning of the paleolithic or old stone
age. It must have lasted a very long time, to judge from all the
succeeding changes of climate and water courses.

V.

The following age is the neolithic or new stone age. Its duration
was also very long, sufliciently long for Europe to be covered with its
megalithic monuments and sepulchral structures. It was the time in
which the cutting of flint, carried on toward a state of perfection,
ended in the fashioning of various instruments for fishing, hunting,
or fighting. These lost the rude character of the utensils in the pre-
ceding age, and the polishing of flint marked a turn in the affairs of
prehistoric man.

The bony remains of the neolithic age underwent the same patient
investigation and the same measurements as those of the paleolithic
age; and Rahon and Manouvrier succeeded in determining the
size of the people of this time, as of the preceding. Here the facts
to work upon were much more numerous, for the number of skeletons
that have been extracted is considerable. Conclusions were drawn
from the examination of 429 men and 189 women. The average
stature of the men is 1.645 meters, of the women 1.526 meters. But
among these there were a number cf tall and short persons, Just as is
the case at the present time. To cite several instances, the man of
the Madeleine, the station next to Les Eyzies, in the department of
Dordogne, measured 1.86 meters. The bones found at Les Eyzies
belonged to still larger types. In this region Christy and Lartet
exhumed from the cave of Cro-Magnon three well-preserved skele-
tons, which have given rise to observations of extreme interest to
anthropology. They were the skeletons of an old man, an adult man,
and a woman, and they have served as types for the establishment of
a race become celebrated under the name Cro-Magnon. On a merely
superficial examination of the bones, one can tell that the persons
must have been robust and tall. Broca unqualifiedly declared their
stature to be superior to the Frenchman’s; but since it was impossible
to reconstruct a skeleton in its entirety, he was not in a position to
make direct measurements and give an indisputable figure.

Therefore it was with some hesitation that he assigned to them a
probable height of 1.80 meters. Broca, it must be stated, for aid in
his reconstruction could not fall back upon tables that would have
528 THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS.

enabled him approximately to deduce the size of the entire body from
nothing but the measurement of a single bone like the femur.
Tables of this sort, it is true, existed in his time, provided by physi-
cians who practiced forensic medicine, but they did not inspire him
with confidence because the relations between the various parts of a
skeleton had been established according to the principle of Paris or
Lyon—that is, for the human structure as represented by the existing
race of Frenchmen. But it is known that the relations between the
various parts of the body are not the same in all the races of the
present day; the principles for each are different. So much the
more likely it is they would be different among prehistoric races.
What is more, in a race like the French, there are two distinct types,
each having the same measurement, but the one class is long-
legged (macroscelic, in the term of the anthropologists), the other
short-legged (microscelic). A priori it would seem as though all
these difficulties would dash the hope of establishing a relation more
or less fixed between the segment of a limb and the entire body.
But these are the very difficulties that the methods of anthropometry
were devised to overcome, and, as has been said, the method of Mon-
sieur Manouvrier has succeeded.

Whatever the means employed (and it is useless to recall them
here), Broea decided upon 1.80 meters as the height of the old man
of Cro-Magnon. Some other investigators estimated it at 1.78
meters, and Topinard went so far as to say it was 1.90 meters, a
figure altogether exceptional and unexampled up to this time in
the case of prehistoric man. The estimates of Rahon and Manou-
vrier were lower. They fixed the height of the old man at 1.736
meters; that of the woman at 1.658 meters, and that of the adult man
at 1.667 meters. Even these numbers betoken great height, superior,
certainly, to the average height of the inhabitants of France. The
race of Cro-Magnon, then, was a race of tall-bodied men.

The stature of the man of Mentone, whose skeleton was discoy-
ered by Riviere in ground of the neolithic period of the Quaternary
age, was even larger. The caverns which exist in the red escarp-
ments rising from the broken stone road between Mentone and Vinti-
mille have furnished a fair number of bones, the last specimens being
those of a child, a woman, and a man. Their fragility does not
permit of their being handled and renders their measurement a deli-
cate operation. From the tables of Monsieur Manouvrier the height
of the man is calculated to be 1.752 meters. Monsieur Reviére had
reckoned it to be from 1.95 to 2 meters. It is clear that if one should
consider the man of Mentone as the average type of the man of his
time, the race to which he belonged would have been superior in
stature to that which inhabits the same country to-day. They would
have compared in size with the tallest actual races of Europe, the
THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS. 529

Scandinavians or the Scotch. But there are many reasons for sup-
posing that the man of Mentone ranked in the series of tall-bodied
persons among the men of his own race.

In examining specimens of races inferior in stature to the French
we find the man of Bolwillher measuring 1.60 meters; the skeleton in
the sepulchral Caverne de ’ Homme Mort in the department of
Lozere, 1.62 meters; that in the cave of Géménos, 1.67 meters: in
the cave of the valley of the Rousson, in the department of Gard, 1.63
meters. The man of the cave of Orrouy, in the department of Oise,
represented a vigorous race and was 1.64 meters tall.

It would be irksome to prolong the enumeration. All the caves
and caverns that have delivered up their human bones to the curios-
ity of anthropologists, the contents of all the sepulchral erypts, all
prehistoric burial places, the dolmens of Belgium, of Quiberon, those
in the departments of Lozére and Indre, the sepulchral vaults of a
dolmenic character, like those of Crécy en-Vexin, the covered alleys
like that of Mureaux, the peat districts of the department of Somme,
and the dolmens of Algeria—the contents of all these have been
examined and the bones found in them measured. The measure-
ments made of more than 400 subjects (to be exact, 429) give us a
more correct idea than we previously had of the stature of our ances-
tors in the neolithic period, and we are able to say with certainty
that they were perceptibly shorter than the Frenchmen of to-day,
their average height being 1.645 meters; that of the French, 1.650
meters. Therefore it is not true that we have undergone an evolu-
tionary process of degeneration. It would be false to state that

primitive man was our superior in stature.

Anthropological investigations bearing upon historic times scarcely
offer anything more of interest to us, for one can tell in advance that
measurements of the body would not furnish different results from
those already set forth, since the stature of men of our race, which
did not vary in the course of thousands of centuries during a period
of extraordinary changes, would certainly not undergo perceptible
variation in the course of a few hundred years during which condi-
tions of existence have sustained but insignificant changes in com-
parison with those of preceding periods. Such, in fact, is the very
conclusion to be drawn from the examinations made by Rahon and
Manouvrier of the bones of human beings in various epochs of the
historic period. In the first group they place the bones that may
be called proto-historic, since they belong to a time the date of which
has not been exactly fixed and of which no records remain. For
example, in the museum of natural history (Paris) there is a collec-
tion of bones gotten together by M. de Morgan from the dolmens of
the Caucasus near Koban and belonging to men who lived at an

sM 1904——34
530 THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS.

epoch not exactly determined, which corresponds to the age of iron.
These men are of those who constructed the megalithic monuments of
Roknia and of the Caucasus, in which their remains are found.
Their stature is hardly larger than that of the actual inhabitants of
the country, the men reaching a mean height of 1.673 meters and
the women 1.564 meters. According to Schortt, the average size of
the present natives of Caucasus is 1.650 meters. Therefore we have
an average height almost the same as that of the French.

In turning to France, an examination of the skeletons found in
the Gallic or Gallo-Roman cemeteries of Vert-la-Gravelle, of Jon-
chery, and of Mont-Berny reveals a height of 1.66 meters in the men
and 1.55 meters in the women. The Frankish populations buried in
the sepulchers of the Department of Marne were 1.67 meters in
height; those of the cemetery of Ramasse in the Department of Ain,
considered to be Burgundians by M. de Mortillet, showed a height of
1.666 meters for the men and 1.538 for the women. The average
stature of these peoples, who occupied France in the Gallo-Roman
epoch, was a bit higher than that of the French nowadays, but not so
much higher as one would suppose from the remarks of historians.
With each investigation of each epoch the same conclusion is reached,
and we repeat it as though it were the refrain of a couplet: Man’s
stature in the proto-historic period, as in the preceding period, was
almost invariable.

The final researches of M. Rahon bear upon the Parisian popula-
tion from the fourth to the eleventh centuries. The cemetery of
Saint-Marcel was used in the fifth and sixth centuries, that of Saint-
Germain-des-Prés more recently, in all liklihood in the tenth and
eleventh centuries. The comparison and measurement of bones from
these two cemeteries show that the average height of men and women
is the same for both burial places, being 1.677 meters in the case of
the men and 1.575 meters in the case of the women. The result gives
rise to two observations. One is that in the course of six centuries
the average height of Parisians has maintained a remarkable fixity.
.The other observation bears upon a comparison with the present
stature of Parisians. A difference of nearly 1 centimeter (7 milli-
meters) in favor of the medizeval Parisians exists between the average
height of present Parisians and those of the middle ages.

This is at once a great deal and very little. The greater size is
explained by the fact that the bones which were put aside, guarded
in collections, and finally submitted to measurement were the
best preserved, the most solid, and those, in consequence, which, hav-
ing most successfully resisted destruction, proved in themselves that
they had belonged to the select. One such circumstance is sufficient
to explain a slight difference of some millimeters.

It may be admitted as the result of pretty general experience—the
THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS. 531

result, in fact, which arises from all that has so far been said in the
present article—that when a race or people is sufficiently homoge-
neous, When it is not too mixed with other very dissimilar races, the
average height is found to remain the same, provided enough meas-
urements have been obtained. In the course of time it becomes inva-
riable; it provides significant indications of great value. he ame-
lioration of conditions of existence, which would appear to increase
stature, does so only indirectly by eliminating a greater number of
exceptional cases, which lower the average in a factitious manner. It
excludes from comparison persons who, through disease or sickness
contracted during the period of growth, have not developed harmo-
niously or attained their full height.

Nevertheless, it 1s important to state that the results announced
some years ago by Manouvrier and Rahon have raised some objec-
lions. At first glance it is clear that all their measurements syste-
matically lower the numbers generally assigned to man’s height.
In many cases the outcome of their exact methods contradicts not only
general opinion, but the affirmations of historians and the results of
approximate measurements. Objection was raised before the society
of anthropology. A. Hovelacque, in particular, expressed his aston-
ishment at the very low figure at which M. Rahon estimated the
height of the Burgundians of Ramasse. All ancient authors agree
in declaring the Burgundians, a Teutonic people, originally from
North Germany, between the Oder and the Vistula, to have been
extremely tall men. According to the measurements of M. Rahon
they were only a little above the average (1.666 meters). If, as M. de
Mortillet says is true, the men buried at Ramasse were Burgun-
dians, and if the number of skeletons examined is enough to establish
an average, one sees the consequences of the flagrant contradiction
between anthropology on the one hand and historic evidences on the
other.

M. Manouvrier replied to the objections made by A. Hovelacque.
He declared that this contradiction did not affect him, since the deter-
mination of the size of the body from exact measurements of the long
bones was an operation sufficiently precise to carry greater weight
than the assertions of historians and geographers. Even the most
exact historians, like Herodotus, Ceesar, and Strabo were capable of
exaggerating the size of the people of whom they wrote. We have
seen how the navigators and explorers of the eighteenth century, in
speaking of the Patagonians, of individuals whom they themselves
had seen, gave varying descriptions of them. Some set their height
down as 6 feet, others at 74 feet or more. Such facts as this may well
put us on our guard against illusions of the eye, and still more against
those of the imagination.

Even so, the figures given in regard to the height of the Burgun-
532 THE STATURE OF MAN AT VARIOUS EPOCHS.

dians indicate that they were a tall-bodied race. Their stature is 16
millimeters, or nearly 2 centimeters more than that of the average
Frenchman of to-day. And such a difference is not a negligible
quantity. It makes an impression upon the eye, gratifying in its
certainty, and it corresponds to the difference of judgment expressed
when we say of a man that he is middle-sized, or of another that he
is tall. For example, we call the Sardinians short and the Belgians
tall; yet the average height of the Sardinians is only 2 centimeters
less, and of the Belgians only 2 centimeters more, than that of the
French.

The general conclusion of the studies sketched in brief in the pres-
ent article can be nothing but a repetition of the conclusions reached
at the end of each special study. The bones of primitive man, of pre-
historic man, and, finally, of historic man, when submitted to exam-
ination, show that man’s stature has experienced no appreciable
changes in the course of time, has shown no traces of an evolutionary
degeneration. We are not a stunted posterity, and we have the right
to spurn the insult of the poet who says that ‘“ we are dwarfs beside
our fathers.”
OLD AGE.¢

By Envir METCHNIKOFF,

Subdirector of the Pasteur Institute.

In compliance with the request of Doctor Toulouse, editor of the
Revue Scientifique, I will try to give you an idea of the present
state of our knowledge concerning old age, and I shall begin by
speaking of the difficulty of the task which I have to perform. The
problem of old age is one of the most complicated and difficult found
in the biological field. As it is far from being solved it will be
impossible for me to present to you a completed study with results
sufficiently precise to be practically apphed. On the other hand,
the course of procedure which we pursue in studying this question
has already been made public, and consequently contains nothing
especially new.

The reason why, in spite of these disadvantages, I have accepted
the proposition of M. Toulouse is because I wish to inform the pub-
lic concerning the extent of our investigations upon old age and to
make known what an immense field yet remains to be covered before
we can arrive at a satisfactory solution of the problem.

In considering this question of old age we are beset on every side
with difficulties. At what period of our life does this ultimate
stadium begin; at what time ought a man to say that, having entered
upon this stage of his existence he dare no longer conduct himself
as an able-bodied individual? You will doubtless recall that it was
but a few months ago that the students of the faculty of medicine
in Paris loudly and noisily protested against the decision of the
Senate that had suspended the law prescribing a limit of age for the
professors. “ We do not want old dotards,” declared these young
men. It is not rare to see old scientists of very great merit remain in
their chairs up to an age when they are no longer capable of assim-
ilating scientific progress, of judging correctly concerning new ad-
vances. Their auditors readily see that they are no longer abreast

with their coworkers; the old professors alone can not perceive this.
As regards myself, if I had remained in my native country I would
necessarily have been retired five years ago as having accomplished
my thirty-five years of service.

You understand that, in view of this my task becomes still more
delicate. Happily, in the present state of our civilization one risks
only more or less disapproval. In the more ancient times or among
modern uncivilized peoples the situation was and is much more
serious.

Thus, throughout Melanesia it is the custom to bury alive old men
who become incapable of useful labor. At Vate the old men have
at least this consolation, that during the funeral ceremonies it 1s cus-
tomary to attach to their arms a pig which may be eaten during the
feast given in honor of the departure of the soul for the other world.

When the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego are threatened with
famine they kill and eat the old women before they do the dogs.
One who asked why they did this was answered, “ Dogs catch seals
while old women do not.”

Civilized peoples do not imitate the Fuegians or other savages.
They do not kill and eat their superannuated members, yet the life
of the aged often becomes very unhappy. Ineapable of any useful
work in the family or the community, old people are considered as
a very heavy charge, and though we have no right to make way with
them, we desire, nevertheless, their final departure, and are impatient
at its long delay. The Italians say that “ old women have seven
lives;” the Burgomasks think that old women have seven souls,
besides an eighth soul, quite small, and a half-soul besides, and the
Lithuanians complain that an old woman is so tenacious of life that
she can not even be ground in a mill.

These popular opinions have their echo in the frequent occurrence
of criminal attempts on the lives of old men, even in the most civilized
countries of Europe. In running through the chronicle of crimes
one is astounded at the number of assassinations of old people, espe-
cially of old women. -It is not difficult to find the motives of these
criminal acts. A convict in Saghahen Island, condemned for the
assassination of several old men, ingenuously remarked to the physi-
cian of the prison: “ What’s the use of making a fuss about them ?
They were already old, and would have died anyway in a few years.”

In the celebrated novel of Dostojewsky, Crime and Punishment,
the author takes his readers into a tavern where the young people are
discussing all sorts of general problems. In the midst of the con-
versation a student declares that he “ would kill and rob the cursed
old woman without the shehtest remorse.” “ In fact,” he continues,
“this is the way the matter stands: on one side we have a stupid,
unfeeling old woman, of no account, wicked and sick, whom no one
OLD AGE. 535

would miss; on the contrary, who is an injury to everyone, who does
not herself know why she keeps on living, and who perhaps will
be good and dead to-morrow. While on the other hand there are
fresh young lives wasting for nothing at all, without being helped by
anyone; these can be numbered by thousands; everywhere it is the
same.”

Old men not only risk being assassinated; they often end their
lives prematurely by committing suicide. Deprived of the means
of existence, or attacked by serious maladies, they prefer death to
their unhappy life. The frequency of suicides among old men is
well established by statistics and supported by a quantity of precise
data. This fact has long been known. New statistics tend to confirm
it. Thus, in 1878, in Prussia there were 154 suicides per 100,000 indi-
viduals among men from 20 to 50 years of age, and almost double that,
295, among men between 50 and 80. Denmark, the classical country
of suicide, confirms the rule. There were at Copenhagen, during the
years from 1886 to 1895, for every 100,000 individuals, 394 suicides
among men from 30 to 50 ye vars of age, and 686 cases of self-murder
among the old from 50 to 70 years of age. The young and strong
adults furnished, therefore, 364 per cent of suicides, while the num-
ber afforded by the aged amounted to 634 per cent.

It is only in exceptional cases that these suicides can be attributed
io the failure of the instinct of life. Most frequently life, although
desired, becomes intolerable because of such circumstances as we have
already mentioned. The desire to live, instead of diminishing tends,
on the contrary, to increase with age. The old F uegian women, aware
that they are destined to be eaten, flee into the mountains whither they
are pursued by the men and carried back home where they must sub-
mit to death.

It has for a long time been noticed that the longer one lives, the
longer one desires to live. Charles Renouvier, a French philosopher,
recently deceased, gave new proof of the truth of this rule. When 88
years old and feeling himself to be dying, he jotted down his impres-
sions during his last days. This is what he wrote four days before
his death:

“T have no illusions regarding my condition. I know that I am
soon to die, in a week or perhaps two, and yet [ have so many things
to say about our doctrine. At my age one has no right to hope.
One’s days, or perhaps one’s hours are numbered. I must be
resigned. * * * JT can not die without regret. I regret that I
can in no way foresee what will become of my ideas. Besides I am
going before I have said my last word. One always has to leave
before terminating one’s task. This is one of the saddest of the sad-
nesses of life. * * * This is not all. When one is old, very old,
habituated to life, it is very difficult to die. I readily beheve that
young people accept the idea of death more easily than the old.
536 OLD AGE.

When one is beyond 80 years he becomes cowardly and does not
wish to die, and when one knows beyond question that death is near
a feeling of melancholy prevades the soul. * * * I have studied
the question in all its aspects. I know that I am going to die, but I

do not succeed in convincing myself that I am going to die. It is

not the philosopher in me that protests. The philosopher in me does
not believe in death, it is the old man, the old man who has not the
courage to face the inevitable. However, one must be resigned.”

It is seen then that in spite of old age, in spite of the wear of the
spirit and the body, the instinct of life really increases with age. Old
men desire to live, desire to continue to play their part and to go on
with their work, as is proved by the old professors who do not want to
abandon their chairs. Old men do not eyen renounce the tender
passion. When 74 years old Goethe fell in love with Ulrica von
Lewezow, a young girl of 17 years, and even proposed marriage.
Failure in this project caused him great unhappiness, which he
expressed in an elegy known as the Elegy of Marienbad. This is
his plaint:

“An invincible desire distrains me; no resource is left me but
eternal tears. Let them burst forth and flow on unrestrained. They
can never extinguish the flame that consumes me. Already furious,
it rages in my breast where life and death contend in fearful strife.
* * * For me the universe is lost. I am lost to myself. The
gods, whose favorite I lately was, have tried me; they lent me
Pandora, so rich in treasures, richer still in dangerous seductions ;
they intoxicated me with the kisses of her mouth which gave so much
delight; they snatch me from her arms and strike me with death.”

This unhappy love suggested to the old poet some brilliant strophes,
but the works of the last period of Goethe’s life, such as the second
part of Faust or the end of Wilhelm Meister, show a decided decline
in his genius.

Old age is, then, the epoch of our existence which is full of the
greatest contradictions. On the one hand there is a great desire to
live, to be active, to love; on the other, the impossibility of realizing
these desires. What are the characteristics of this period of human
hfe which is so full of unhappiness? ;

it.

The aspect of old age is too well known for it to be necessary to
describe it in detail. The skin of the face is dry, wrinkled, usually
pale. The hair is white, the body more or less bent, the walk slow and
difficult, the memory defective. Such are the most significant traits
of the aged. It is often thought that baldness is characteristic of old
age, but this opinion is erroneous, for the head begins to become bald
at a comparatively early period. At an advanced age baldness fol-
lows its course, but whoever has not begun to lose his hair when young
will not become bald during old age.
OLD AGE. bod

Stature decreases with age. According to numerous measurements
men lose, between 50 and 85 years, more than 8 centimeters (3.166),
women still more (4.3 centimeters). Sometimes this loss may reach
6 or even 7 centimeters.

Weight also diminishes during old age. According to Quételet, the
maximum weight of men is attained at 40 years of age, of women at
50. From 60 years onward weight diminishes and at 80 years this
loss amounts, on the average, to 6 kilograms.

The diminution in the height and weight of the body indicates a
general atrophy of the organism in old age. Not only do the soft
parts, such as the muscles and the viscera, become lighter, but even the
skeleton loses weight in the old because of the diminution of mineral
matters. This decalcification during old age, extending to all parts
of the skeleton, causes a brittleness of the bones of the aged, which
often leads to fatal results. One of the greatest representatives of
medical science during the nineteenth century, Virchow, at the age
of 82 years, in descending from a tramway, made a false step and
broke the neck of his femur. In spite of all the attention that could
be given hin he died of the general exhaustion of forces after remain-
ing several months in bed. Princess Mathilde fell in her chamber.
This fall, which would have had no bad result in a young person,
‘caused in this woman, 83 years old, a fracture of the neck of the fe-
mur. <As in the case of Virchow a prolonged confinement to bed led
to general malnutrition which terminated in death. This part of the
skeleton, the neck of the femur, becomes particularly brittle in the
old because of osseous atrophy.

The muscles are also much subject to atrophy during old age.
They lose in volume, the muscular tissue becomes paler, the fat
between the muscular fasciculi diminishes in quantity and sometimes
almost completely disappears. Movements also become slower and
muscular force diminishes. Measurements of the force of the hand
and of the trunk, made by means of dynamometers, show a progres-
sive diminution in the old. This enfeeblement is more pronounced in
men than in women.

The volume and the weight of the viscera also diminishes, although
in a different ratio for different organs. In order to explain the gen-
eral atrophy of the body in old age an attempt has been made to ascer-
tain the intimate structure of the organs and tissues of the aged. The
visible manifestations of our organs represent the total of the fune-
tions of the microscopic elements that enter into their constitution.
In order to understand the formation of the caleareous deposits upon
which Paris is sifuated, and by aid of which its houses are con-
structed, it is necessary to consider the properties of the mollusks that
have formed the shells which have accumulated and become cemented
together to produce the stones. In the same way, in order to judge
538 OLD AGE.

of the senile alterations of our body, it is indispensable that we should
study the changes that occur in the cells that compose it.

A great number of these elements are continually being lost. From
the surface of our epidermis are detached minute scales composed of
a quantity of flat desiccated cells that have become incapable of pro-
tecting our skin. The secretions of the mucous membranes daily
carry away great numbers of the cells that make up those membranes.
There is, therefore, a considerable wear of the microscopic elements of
our body which must be reconstituted in order to maintain its equi-
hbrium.

Under these conditions it was quite natural to ask whether the
reparation of our cells is as well effected in the old as in those of
adult life. This question arose all the more naturally because there
are known examples of very low organisms that multiply by division,
and which, after a considerable number of generations, finally fall
into a state of exhaustion in which reproduction becomes gradually
slower and more difficult, and may even cease altogether. This state
of debility, which has been compared to senile atrophy, yields to cer-
tain influences, such as the conjugation of two exhausted individuals,
or even to improved nourishment.

But since among inferior organisms, which resemble so much the
cellular elements of our body, reproduction becomes exhausted at the
end of a certain period, we are led to suppose that the same law may
also apply to the senile atrophy of our own organism. Therefore,
numerous scientists affirm that old age finally results because it is
impossible for an organism to repair the cellular losses by the forma-
tion of a sufficient number of new elements—that is to say, because of
the exhaustion of the reproductive faculty.

One of the scientists who have more especially concerned them-
selves with general questions, Weismann, expresses himself on this
subject in a very categorical manner. According to him, the senile
degeneration that ends in death does not depend on the wearing away
of the cells of our organism but rather upon the fact that cellular
proliferation, being limited, becomes insufficient to repair that loss.
As old age appears in different species and different individuals at
various ages, Weismann concludes that the number of generations
that a cell is capable of producing differs in different cases. It is, how-
ever, impossible for him to explain why, in one example, cellular mul-
tiplication may stop at a certain figure, while in another it may go
much further.

This theory appears so plausible that no attempt has been made
to support it by precise facts. We even see, in the most recent
attempt at a theory of old age, by Doctor Biihler, the thesis of the
exhaustion of the reproductive power of the cells accepted and devel-
oped without sufficient discussion. It can not be denied that it is
OLD AGE. 539

during embryonic life that cells are produced with the greatest
activity. Later on this proliferation becomes slower but it neverthe-
less continues to occur throughout the course of life. Biihler attrib-
utes the difficulty with which wounds heal in the aged, precisely to
the insufficiency of cellular production. He also thinks that the
reproduction of the cells of the epidermis which are to replace the
desiccated parts of the skin diminishes notably during old age.
According to this author it is theoretically easy to predict the
moment when cullular multiplication in the epidermis must com-
pletely cease; as the desiccation and desquamation of the superficial
parts continues without cessation it becomes evident that it must
finally result in the total disappearance of the epidermis. The same
rule is applicable, according to Biihler to the genital glands, the
muscles, and all sorts of other organs.

These theoretical considerations do not, however, agree with well-
known facts which speak but little in favor of a general diminution
of cellular proliferation in old age. The hairs and the nails, which
are excrescences of the epidermis, keep on growing throughout the
entire life, thanks to the reproduction of the cells which constitute
them. There is no arrest at all in the development of these parts
even in the most advanced age. Far from that. We know that the
hair that covers certain portions of the body increases in quantity
and length in the old. In certain inferior races like the Mongols,
the mustaches and the beard do not grow abundantly until advanced
life, while young people have but small mustaches and very little
or no beard. In women of the white race the same phenomenon
oceurs. The delicate and almost imperceptible down that covers the
upper lip, the chin, and the cheeks of young women is transformed
into veritable hair which forms the mustaches, beard, and whiskers
of old women. Doctor Pohl, a specialist in everything that concerns
the hair, measured the rapidity of growth of hair under different
circumstances. He found that in an old man of 61 years the hairs of
the temples grew 11 mm. in a month. But these hairs, in the
same regions, in boys of from 11 to 15 years grew in the same time
11.8 mm., which represents almost the same figure.

There is therefore in the three subjects studied by Doctor Pohl no
considerable diminution in the cellular growth in the old, in spite
of the great difference in age. It is true that this observer showed
that the hair of a young man between 21 and 24 grew at a rate of 15
mm. per month, while in the same individual at the age of 61
years the rate lowered to 11 mm.; but this slowing down of the
growth of the hair was only apparent. In fact, the first figures
related to hair from different regions of the hairy scalp, while the
second related only to the hair of the temples. Now it is well estab-
lished by Doctor Pohl himself that in the latter place the hair grows
540 OLD AGE.

more slowly than elsewhere. On the other hand, in boys from 11 to
15 years old, studied by this observer, the rapidity of development of
the hair was always shown to be less than 15 mm. It was often even
below the 11 mm. found in the man 61 years old.

In spite of the abundant growth of the hair in old age, these parts
undergo a senile degeneration; that is to say, the loss of pigment.
This blanching is doubtless an atrophic phenomenon which is not duc
to an arrest of cellular multiplication, but to the disappearance of
colored granulations,

Let us now cast a glance at some other manifestations of old age.
The debility of muscular movements is connected with modifications
in the structure of the muscular fibers which also do not indicate an
absence of reproductive power. The fascicles which form the mus-
cles undergo a veritable atrophy, for they become much thinner than
in their normal state. Besides there is deposited in their interior a
quantity of fatty granulations, and, what specially merits attention,
the nuclei of the muscular fibers show a very abundant multiplica-
tion, forming masses arranged in long series. Douaud, who has
published a thesis upon the modifications of muscles in old age,
remarks in this connection that the endogenous multiplication of
muscular nuclei in old age is very active and that it takes place in
exactly the same way as in the embryo. In this example of senile
atrophy we are far then from finding a cessation of reproductive
power in the cells.

As regards the brittleness of the bones in old people, this is also
caused by cellular multiplication which produces large cells capable
of destroying the osseous substance and making the bones spongy.

Detailed microscopic observation of senile organs has shown in a
direct manner the existence of cellular multiplication. Thus Sacka-
roft observed it in the lymphatic ganglia of old persons, and among
others in a man 102 years old. The few data just cited suffice to
enable us to reject the theory that old age is caused by the exhaustion
of the reproductive faculty of the cells. We must seek for another
more comformable with the well-established facts of senile degeneres-
ence. Without entering upon new details, let us try to comprehen-
sively survey those we have already given. What common features
connect the blanching of the hair with the atrophy of muscular
fibers and the brittleness of the bones of the aged ?

The loss of colored granulations in the hair is due to the setting free
of a quantity of wandering cells which seize the pigment and trans-
port it elsewhere, leaving the hair decolorized. In the atrophy of
the muscles there is a multipleation of the nuclei and of the substance
that surrounds them. As in the hair there are cells which devour
the pigment, so in the muscles there are the multiplied elements we
have just cited which devour the contractile substance. In senile
OLD AGE. 541]

bone the osseous substance is destroyed by the giant cells mentioned
above. In the cells.of the senile organs just studied the general and
essential phenomena consist, then, in the destruction of parts useful to
the organism by wandering cells that present some traits in common
with each other. They are voracious cells belonging to the category
of elements designated under the generic name of macrophages. Cer-
tain macrophages remove the pigment of the hair, certain others
destroy the osseous lamelle, others still devour the contractile sub-
stance of muscles.

It is easy to prove that this activity or rather superactivity of the
macrophages is observed in the most diverse organs of the aged. It
is found in the brain, where the cells are in the act of devouring the
most noble elements of our organism. In the kidneys and the liver of
old persons there are found collections of macrophages that cause the
secretory cells of those organs to disappear, thus occasioning phenom-
ena of atrophy of very great importance.

After having destroyed the noble elements of the aging organism,
such as the nervous, renal, and hepatic cells, the macrophages become
fixed in place and are transformed into connective tissue without
ever being able to supply the place of the precious elements that
have disappeared. It is in this way that there is set up in the aged
that main factor of our premature decay, sclerosis of the organs. A
study of the special phenomena of old age shows, then, that they
arise from a cellular activity that brings about the destruction of
the noble elements and the superiority of the macrophages. The
latter, which ina normal state act as protectors of the organism against
the invasion of microbes, at last themselves invade the most useful
parts. There is produced in our body by the advance of age some-
thing analogous to what occurs in the old age of certain peoples when
the army, intended to protect the state against exterior enemies, turns
against the citizens of its own country.

In this invasion of the senile organs by the macrophages there
sometimes occurs a veritable struggle between these voracious cells
and our noble elements. Weakened by diverse causes these elements
show signs of degeneration in the form of deposits of fat or of pig-
ment. In these conditions of inferiority the cells of the brain, of the
kidney, or of the liver more readily become a prey to the macrophages,
whence results the loss of intelligence and the disorders of digestion
and of the emunctories which are so common among old people.

But in other cases there can not be any serious question of a struggle
between two categories of living elements. When the macrophages
devour the pigment of the hair, or, indeed, destroy the osseous sub-
stance, there occurs rather an aggression of the macrophages upon
inert parts that are incapable of defending themselves.

We have tried to show that the theory of the mechanism of old age
549 OLD AGE.

which attributes a preponderating part to the attack on the valuable
elements made by the macrophages is not a mere plausible speculation,
but rests on numerous and exact facts. It would be interesting to
penetrate more deeply into the causes of this drama which is being
played within our own organism and which occasions such serious
evils. Unhappily science is not sufficiently informed to satisfy an
investigating spirit otherwise than by the aid of hypotheses.

j00.

It has often been said that old age is a kind of disease. In fact the
great resemblance between these states is incontestable. Among the
maladies to which an organism 1s subject there is a considerable group
that manifest themselves in the form of atrophies. Sometimes it is
an atrophy of muscles which occasions a considerable weakness in
the voluntary movements and in which we find proliferation of the
nuclei, as in the muscles of old people. Atrophic maladies of the
kidneys and of the liver are numerous, and in these we find a dis-
appearance of the glandular tissue and its replacement by connective
tissues the same as we find in old age. Atrophy of the osseous sub-
stance produced by giant cells often occurs in the course of certain
maladies. In all these examples the more profoundly we study the
lesions the more we become convinced of their similarity to those
which take place during old age.

Although the cause of many of the atrophic maladies is still un-
known, there are nevertheless some whose origin is sufficiently estab-
lished. Thus, among the atrophies of the muscles, we may cite that
which is induced by the parasitism of trichine. The penetration of
these minute worms into the muscular fascicles produces lesions that
oceasion multiplication of muscular nuclei and a destruction of the
contractile substance.

The analogy with the atrophy of muscles is undeniable. The
atrophic maladies of glandular apparatuses, such as the liver and the
kidneys, are often occasioned by poisoning by alcohol, lead, and other
chemical substances or they may be occasioned by some infectious
microbic malady. Again, it is this latter cause which often leads
to the destruction of the osseous substance. In certain infectious
maladies like tuberculosis and leprosy the bacilli penetrate into the
bones and succeed in forming there infectious foci. These bacilli
are, however, incapable by themselves of dissolving and destroying
the osseous substance, but the products that escape from them into
the bones exercise an irritating action upon the giant cells which set
to work to eat away the osseous lamelle impregnated with lime. The
tuberculous or leprous agent plays, therefore, only an intermediate
part in the atrophy of the skeleton, which is immediately caused, as in
OLD AGE. 5438

old age, by the work of the giant cells designated under the name of
osteoclasts. :

Since the mechanism of senile atrophy is entirely similar to that of
atrophies of microbie or toxic origin, it may be asked whether in old
age there may not be some intervention of microbes or their poisons.
May not this abnormal excitation of the macrophages that leads
them to destroy all sorts of noble cells of the organism and to even
attack the pigment of the hair and the osseous substance be also due
to the action of certain poisons elaborated within the body? The
principal source of these poisons is clearly indicated: our digestive
tube contains an enormous quantity of microbes, and many of them
are capable of secreting substances that are more or less toxic. Our
intestinal flora resembles the flora or forests in which there are
found by the side of boleti and other edible mushrooms a great num-
ber of poisonous ones. It is true that our intestine is, up to a certain
point, protected against the invasion of the microbes contained in it
and even against their poisonous products. We may with impunity
feed animals that are quite easily affected by certain infectious mala-
dies upon the microbes that produce those maladies. Thus guinea
pigs may swallow without harm great quantities of the bacilli that
produce anthrax, but if there is the least lesion in the intestinal wall
the mortal malady will declare itself. The presence of infectious
microbes in the digestive tube may therefore have sad results.

The intestine is likewise protected against the absorption of certain
poisons. We may, for example, cause guinea pigs to swallow, with-
out effect, many cubic centimeters of tetanic poison, a hundredth part
of a drop of which injected under the skin will inevitably bring on a
mortal tetanus. The intestinal wall does not, therefore, absorb the
tetanic poison. There are, however, other poisons that do not follow
this rule and which are easily absorbed in the intestine. Cases of
poisoning by poisonous mushroooms taken for edible ones are quite
frequent. Neither is there any lack of microbic poisons that traverse
the intestinal wall. We see arise from time to time veritable epi-
demics that are serious and even fatal as a consequence of the con-
sumption of fish, meat, or conserves spoiled by microbes. In these
vases there is usually an entrance into the intestines of the botulynic
bacillus, which secretes a very violent poison readily absorbed by the
organism in the same way as is the poison from noxious mushrooms.
The symptoms of Asiatic cholera are also produced by a toxine elab-
orated in the digestive tube and absorbed by the intestinal wall.

But in the cases which we have just cited there occurs an acute
poisoning, occasioned by the toxic products of microbes and of mush-
rooms introduced into the intestines. Now, there is no doubt but
that there occur besides these examples others in which the poisoning
is less violent and less rapid and in which the microbes of the intes-

‘
544 OLD AGE.

tinal contents secrete their products for a long time, thus setting up
a chronic poisoning. It is exactly among these products that we
should seek for the cause of the weakening of our noble elements
and the stimulation of the destructive activity of the macrophages.
Tt is true that certain poisons once absorbed by the organism initiate
the production of counter poisons Thus, Ehrlich, after having
caused his mice to swallow quantities of vegetable toxines, ricine and
abrine, proved that the blood of these animals became the best anti-
dote against these poisons. The human organism after absorbing
for years the microbic products elaborated in the intestines might
indeed thus acquire an immunity with regard to them. This sup-
position is very probable, but it does not at all apply to a whole
series of microbic poisons, such as the phenolic substances, the
ammoniacal salts, and others, for their absorption oceasions no
production of counter poisons.

According to the hypothesis we are advancing, the principal
phenomena of old age depend upon the indirect action of microbes
that become collected in our digestive tube. And, since the wearing
away of the substance of the bones in tuberculosis and leprosy is
effected by osteoclasts excited by the poisons derived from the bacilli
characteristic of those two maladies, so the same wearing away of
the bones may come from a stimulation of the same osteoclasts by the
poisons of intestinal microbes. If this is the case, our organism con-
tains within itself the cause of its own destruction, in the same way
that grapes carry upon their surface the germs of the ferments that
set up alcoholic fermentation by destroying the sugar the fruits
contain.

This hypothesis rests upon a great number of well-established
facts, but it lacks direct proof, which can only be furnished by inves-
tigations carried on for long years. In this imperfect state it
becomes necessary to bring together as many arguments as possible
in order to justify our supposition.

If it is really intestinal microbes that are the cause of our senile
atrophy, we must believe that the more the flora of the intestines 1s
reduced the fewer manifestations of old age there will be.

If we compare an old mammal with an old bird we are at once
struck with the great difference in their external appearance. An old
horse or an old dog can easily be recognized by its ugliness, its lazy
movements, its worn teeth, its lusterless hair turned white on certain
portions of the body. A dog of 12 to 15 years shows very markedly
all these signs of senile decrepitude. Birds keep their age much bet-
ter and longer than mammals do. An aged duck, more than 20 years
old, is alert in its movements and does not show externally any sign of
its advanced age. Parrots and parroquets also remain for long years
in a very youthful state. <A little parroquet from 15 to 19 years eld,
OLD AGE. 545

which I observed very closely for several years, manifested no signs
whatever of old age. It was very lively and curious, interesting
itself in all sorts of things about it, and its plumage was brilliant and
richly colored. We have possessed for some years past a parroquet
that, according to reliable information, must be from 70 to 75 years
old. It is impossible to recognize its advanced age, so normal is its
appearance and so easy are its movements.

The few examples just cited confirm the general rule that birds
have a much geater longevity than the large majority of mammals.
Now, birds are distinguished by having an intestinal flora very much
poorer in microbes than that of mammals. Possessing no large intes-
tine, birds lack that great reservoir for alimentary refuse which, in
mamimals, breeds an enormous quantity of all sorts of microbes. A
very simple method of assuring ourselves of this consists In a micro-
scopic examination directed toward ascertaining the comparative
quantity of microbes contained in different parts of the digestive tube
of a small mammal, a white mouse for example. We find quite a
large number in the stomach; very few in the upper portions of the
small intestine. The lower part of the small intestine contains many
microbes, but it 1s in the cecum and the large intestine that are found
quantities truly enormous. The examination of the digestive organs
of a small bird, a canary for example, having the same weight as the
mouse above mentioned, gives quite a different result. In canaries
microbes are found, but in very small numbers. The stomach and the
small intestine contain throughout their course only a few isolated
specimens. The inferior portion of the intestinal tract contains a few
more microbes, but their number is very far from being equal to that
found in the mouse. The cecum, that large reservoir for intestinal
microbes in the mouse, is represented in the canary merely by two
rudimentary culs de sac destitute of microbes. It is not astonishing
that, under these conditions, the toxic effects derived from intestinal
sources should be much less in the canary (and in birds in general)
than in the mouse and most other animals. So we sce that while the
mouse is already old after a few years, and lives hardly five years at
most, the canary 1s vigorous for a much longer period and may attain
the age of 15 or even 20 years.

When we see that cold-blooded vertebrates, such as turtles and
crocodiles, attain a very advanced age without showing any extensive
signs of senility, we are tempted to ascribe this fact to the rather
inactive life of those animals. As they do not need to maintain a
high bodily temperature, they take but little food and are not forced
to expend much energy in procuring it. Birds have none of these
advantages. They lead a very active and agitated life; in order to
preserve their normal condition they must maintain a higher bodily

sM 1904——35

ny
546 OLD’ AGE:

temperature than is necessary for mammals, yet they attain a greater
and more active old age than do mammals, even including man.

Notwithstanding the great difference between the life of birds on
the one hand and that of turtles and crocodiles on the other, these
animals have this point in common, that in them the large intestine
is very slightly developed, if not absent, and their intestinal flora is
extremely scanty.

In spite of the imperfect state of our knowledge at the present
time, the mass of facts we have cited may well justify us in main-
taining the hypothesis that the intestinal microbes play the part of
one of the preponderant causes of that chronic malady, our old age.

Since science has already found very efficacious means both for
protecting the organism against infectious maladies and for curing
such maladies when they are not too far advanced, why should not
one seek for something to render old age less painful, it also being a
state which should be considered as having a microbic origin ?

If, as seems more and more probable, the source of our early decay
is found in our intestinal flora, we ought to seek some means either
for eliminating it more or less completely or for modifying it pro-
foundly. The idea of suppressing the large intestine, that useless
part of our digestive tube that we have inherited from our animal
progenitors and that serves as the principal reservoir for noxious
microbes, can not be considered seriously. It is evident that we can
not count upon the extirpation or even upon the surgical exclusion
of the large intestine. In the cases in which this operation becomes
unavoidable we find that the organism tends to form a second large
intestine. We have under observation at the present time a young
woman in whom the suppression of the greater part of this organ,
made nearly a year ago, has by no means suppressed the disadvan-
tages due to intestinal microbes. It even seems that there is pro-
duced at the expense of the remaining portion of the large intestine
a pocket which collects the alimentary waste and nourishes a multi-
tude of microbes.

In the present state of our knowledge we are inclined rather to
consider the question of modifying our intestinal flora. There is
now present in it many injurious microbes. It is only necessary to
have some lesion in the intestinal wall that allows these to escape into
the peritoneum to set up an infectious disease of the gravest character.

The microbes capable of inducing putrefaction are among the most
dangerous. Now, these microbes have bitter enemies in other mi-
crobes, especially in those that set up the fermentation of sugars and
produce lactic acid. Are there no means of acclimatizing such
microbes within our digestive tube in order to combat with their aid
intestinal putrefaction ¢ ;

Bacteriological researches have shown that many microbes, even
OLD AGE. 54%

’

when taken in very targe quantities, perish in the intestines of man
and of animals. Thus, for example, the vibrio of cholera, that dread
agent of Asiatic cholera, has-many times been swallowed with im-
punity by various persons. Its destruction was so complete that it
was impossible to find it again in the alimentary waste. Schiitz
introduced directly into the small intestine of dogs a quantity of
vibrios which he saw soon after had disappeared. The same phenom-
ena were observed in chickens, the microbes being destroyed in their
digestive tubes.

Tn every attempt at a modification of the intestinal flora it is, then,
necessary to find out whether a given microbe is really capable of
living in the intestines. For certain lactic microbes this fact has
been established by experiment. In curdled milk prepared by a fer-
ment of Bulgarian origin, placed at our disposal by Professor Massol,
at Geneva, there is found a large bacillus remarkable for its ability
to produce a great amount of lactic acid. This bacillus, when swal-
lowed by man, does not suffer the fate of the vibrios which we have
mentioned. It is not destroyed in the intestines, but passes through
alive. Its presence has been demonstrated by Doctor Cohendy even
many days after its introduction by the mouth. Here, then, is a
microbe not normally present in our intestinal flora which may be
implanted there artificially, either with curdled milk or under the
form of a pure culture; endowed with great power of producing
fermentation, it will be capable of effectively combatting intestinal
putrefactions.

It is interesting to note that this microbe is found in the sour milk
consumed in large quantities by the Bulgarians in a region famous
for the longevity of its inhabitants.

We have, then, reason to suppose that the introduction of this Bul-
garian clotted milk into our diet may counteract, or at least diminish,
the injurious effect of the intestinal flora. This would be the first
example of artificial modification of that flora.

To sow useful microbes within our digestive tube is not sufficient.
It is also necessary to prevent the introduction of injurious ones.
With this end in view we should avoid, as much as possible, uncooked
foods that serve as vehicles for all sorts of microbes. In spite
of the washing of vegetables and fruits, such as salads, radishes,
strawberries, cherries, and others, they are yet contaminated with
dust, soil, manure, and fecal matters. Now, these often contain in-
jurious microbes and eggs of animal parasites. Doctor Bienstock
found in the earth of his strawberry beds tetanic spores, which he
found would be destroyed in his own digestive tube when a little of
that earth was swallowed. But we must not count too much on the
antimicrobic power of our intestines, and it is much more prudent not
to use these vegetables and fruits until they are cooked—that is to
548 OLD AGE.

say, until after the destruction of all or a large part of the microbes
that they contain. ‘This measure, together with the use of water that
has been boiled, will prevent, once for all, the penetration into our
body of wiid microbes whose injurious effects can not be denied.

Thanks to the means we have just outlined, as well as to others
which we may add thereto later on, we may in the future transform
our intestinal flora, now so varied and uncultivated, into a flora of
much fewer species, exempt from injurious microbes but containing
useful ones—in a word, into a cultivated flora:

But independently of this prospect, it 1s possible to avoid the dis-
advantages of our present intestinal flora by specific serums, prepared
with a view to neutralizing the injurious action of certain microbic
poisons and of destroying the microbes themselves.

As, according to our hypothesis, these microbes act upon our organ-
ism by weakening our noble elements and stimulating their adver-
saries, the macrophages, it will be rational to seek the means for rein-
forcing the former. The weakening of the latter can not be
considered for the moment, as the macrophages are of great use to us
in the struggle against several infectious diseases, and notably against
the most terrible of all, tuberculosis.

The idea of reinforcing our noble elements is based upon the study
of certain poisons called cytotoxines. Not being able to enter into
the details of this question we will content ourselves with remarking
that, while strong doses of these poisons destroy our cells, minute
doses, on the contrary, reinforce them. We should, then, attempt to
assist our noble elements in their struggle against the macrophages
by the aid of cytotoxines. This problem is complex and delicate, and
requires humerous preliminary researches of long duration. These
were begun a year ago. At this time the question is not sufficiently
mature for any kind of discussion.

The theory of old age and the hypotheses which are connected with
it may be summarized in a few words; the senile degeneration of our
organism is entirely similar to the lesions induced by certain maladies
of a microbie origin. Old age, then, is an infectious: chronic disease
which is manifested by a degeneration, or an enteebling of the noble
elements, and by the excessive activity of the macrophages. These
modifications cause a disturbance of the equilibrium of the cells com-
posing our body and set up a struggle within our organism which
ends in a precocious aging and in premature death, contrary to
nature.

It is very probable that during the time we are growing old the
intestinal microbes that have set up within our body permanent fac-
tories for different poisons play a very important part. It is, then,
entirely possible to struggle against premature senility by modifying
OLD AGE. 549

our intestinal flora and by reenforcing our noble elements, so sensitive
to microbie poisons. :

But, you may say, all this is theoretical. It may be scientific, but
it has not been proven. You may ask me to speak to you of our
present established knowledge concerning old age, of what modern
medicine proposes to do in the way of remedying this unenviable con-
dition. This question has for a long time been under consideration,
and I will now give you the last utterance of empiric wisdom. A
much-esteemed physician of London, Doctor Weber, who is himself
very old, has quite recently summarized the means that he used to
make his own age supportable and to ameliorate that of his numerous
clients.

These are the rules that he drew up for this purpose: “All the
organs must be preserved in a state of vigor. Morbid tendencies,
whether hereditary or acquired during life, must be recognized and
combated. Moderation must be used in the consumption of food and
drink as well as in the pursuit of other corporeal pleasures. The air
within and about the dwelling must be pure. Corporeal exercise
must be taken daily in all conditions of weather. In many cases it is
also necessary to take respiratory exercises as well as to walk and
climb. One must retire early and rise early. Sleep should be lm-
ited to six or seven hours. Every day a bath should be taken or the
body be well rubbed. The water employed for this may be cold or
warm according to individual temperament. Sometimes warm and
cold water may be alternately employed. Regular work and intel-
lectual occupation are indispensable. The mental attitude should be
that of enjoyment of living, tranquillity of mind, and a hopeful con-
ception of life. On the other hand, the passions and nervous disturb-
ances of sorrow should be combatted. Finally, one should have a firm
determination that will compel the preservation of health, the avoid-
ance of alcoholic hquors and other stimulants as well as narcotics and
analgesic substances.”

These counsels are certainly very useful to follow, but very fre-
quently they are insufficient for the attainment of a normal old age.
Many very sober persons, not addicted to alcoholism nor any other
excess, contract chronic maladies of the kidneys, of the blood vessels,
of the digestive organs, and of the nervous system which result in
premature and most painful old age.

Empirical rules, even when dictated by the widest experience, can
not, then, suffice to solve the problem, and we must seek the aid of
science in order to obtain an effective result. The scientific study of
old age is therefore indispensable. In order to make this study pos-
sible, we must, first of all, have material upon which to work; that is
to say, old people, and, indeed, many old people. The opinion that

.
550 OLD AGE.
old people are merely a burden upon society, which ought to support
them simply because of our moral laws, is certainly erroneous.

Not only do the young, but many older persons share the opinion
that old people incapabie of work are no longer good for anything.
Some ten years ago a celebrated German physiologist, who had
reached a great age, told me how he felt because of his uselessness to
society, and added: “ What can one do? I can not decide to kill
myself.” Well, now that science has taken up seriously the study of
the problem of old age, old people have become very useful subjects,
especially so for the young, who may be able to profit by the results
of these studies. If we should make way with the aged, as certain
savage tribes sill do, old age could never be modified nor ameliorated.
Tf we should make way with the sick, as was formerly done, and as is
still done among certain tribes, we should never discover any means
for curing diseases. If we had killed diphtheritics under the pretext
that the greater part of them were going to die and that they were a
source of danger to their healthy neighbors, we should never have
discovered the serum which now cures them.

Old people, even in their condition of decrepitude, may be very
useful, on condition that scientists ean be found who will undertake
the task of carefully studying them. There is also a certain consola-
tion in the thought that when we ourselves have become incapable of
studying old age we may serve as subjects of study to other observers.
In any case, it is to be hoped that in the future, which is, without
doubt, somewhat distant as yet. old age may cease to be one of the
greatest misfortunes of humanity, and that this chronic disease may
vield to the ever-increasing progress of exact science.
CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY TO
HUMAN HISTORY.¢

By W. H. flo“MEs.

The importance of archeology to the student of history is now fully
recognized. The science is establishing its claims to consideration
more fully year by year, especially since it has become allied with
geology, which furnishes the necessary time scale, and with paleon-
tology, which supplies the scale of life. The branch of inquiry
which only a few years ago dealt with isolated fragments of knowl-
edge, with disjointed portions of the framework of human his-
tory, now essays to aid in building up the entire skeleton of that
history, and, with the aid of the allied sciences of ethnology and psy-
chology, in clothing it with the integuments of a living reality.

America is taking a noteworthy part in this rehabilitation of the
race and, fortunately, is most helpful just where the Old World is
weakest. In America the past of man, for the most part at least,
connects directly with the present and with the living. Exch step
backward along the course of culture development proceeds from a
well-established and fully understood base, and there is thus no
baffling gap between history and prehistory, as in the Old World.

In America all the steps of culture from the highest to the lowest
within the native range are to be observed among the living peoples,
and we are thus able to avoid many of the snares of speculation with
respect to what men have thought and men have done under the
greatly diversified conditions of primitive existence.

In America the conditions are simple. The antiquities of a region
represent in a large measure the early history of the known peoples
of that region. There have not been the successive occupations, the
racial interminglings, the obscuring and obliteration of phenomena
that so seriously embarrass the student of the ancient nations of the

Old World. The stone age and the red race stand practically alone
within the field of study.

In America the high-water mark of culture barely reached the
lower limit of civilization. In the Old World the fuller representa-
tion of man’s career is above that limit, so that America can be ex-
pected to assist, especially in building up the substructure of human
history. It can be expected to furnish a fuller reading of the early
chapters of culture progress than any other part of the world.

The position of aboriginal America in the field of culture history
and the area of that history which American archeology, ‘as well as
American ethnology, can be expected to illumine is clearly indicated
in the accompanying diagram.

In this diagram the whole field of human history is represented
by the five spaces which, beginning below, are: (1) The stage of pre-
human development, through and out of which the race arose; (2)

the average stage, in which humanity took definite shape; (8) the
barbarous stage, in which powerful nations were founded and sys-
tems of record were developed; (4) the civilized stage, in which
higher culture was achieved, and (5) the enlightened stage, reached
as yet only by a limited number of nations. The idea of time is not
involved in this diagram. The stages of progress thus become a
scale on which the cultural achievements of any race or people in its,
struggle upward may be laid down. It enables us to show just what
relative place is taken by each race or people and just how much and
at what points each can contribute to the history of man; for human
history as written is composite, made up of the separate histories
of many peoples of all grades of development set together as a
inosaic.

The fan-shaped figure A in the diagram may be taken to express
the history of the race; that is, the whole of human progress from
CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY TO HUMAN HISTORY. 553

the slender beginnings of the savage stage up to its greatest expan-
sion at the present day. The same figure may stand with equal pro-
priety for the career-of a single people or nation that has reached
the highest mit of culture. In the diagram, the beginnings of
cultural development are represented at the base of the figure by a
few slender threads of activity. In savagery these threads multiply
slowly into a considerable number and, with ever accelerated rapidity,
divide and subdivide in barbarism and civilization, expanding with
marvelous rapidity in the horizon of enlightenment. While this
expanding figure may be regarded as expressing the growth of human
culture, it may also symbolize the development of the race in popula-
tion and in physical perfection.

The figure indicated by B may stand for the career of peoples of the
lowest existing order of culture, such as the Fuegians or Andama-
nese—peoples which can contribute to general history only within a
very limited range, since their career traverses only the lower half
of the field of savagery. It is to be noted, however, that these lowly
peoples can contribute much more fully to the history of this partic-
ular stage of progress than can any of the nations that have passed
this stage and have risen to higher levels.

The field covered by the American race is outlined in C. Uncer-
tain and indefinite in the beginning stages, the traces being hardly
legible on account of the absence of written records and the insuffi-

ciency of archeological research, it develops upward, stopping just
short of the level of civilization. Many strands of culture had ep-
peared and had grown strong, but writing had not been fully achieved
and other arts peculiar to civilization had not made their appearance.
It is within this field that Americanists pursue their studies and make
their contributions to the history of the race and of developing civili-
zation. Above this stage they find nothing and below it only meager
and uncertain traces of the beginning stages of human culture. The
archeologist finds within this limited American field, however, exten-
sive phenomena relating to the various branches of barbarian activity,
especially to such as leave their traces in material form. Prominent
among these branches are agriculture, hunting, fishing, quarrying, and
mining. The shaping of implements and utensils, the building arts,
metallurgy, sculpture, ceramics, the textile arts, the graphic arts and
writing, war, games, culinary arts, religious arts, personal adornment.
the decorative arts, etc. These groups of phenomena, as exhibited in
America, have been the subject of earnest study by a large number of
scholars and already a great body of data relating to them has been
collected and an extensive literature is in existence. A few of the
more instructive of these groups may be briefly reviewed.

Quarrying and mining —Much of the history of the activities con-
cerned in the acquisition of the raw materials of subsistence and the
554 CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY TO HUMAN HISTORY.

arts is best studied among existing peoples. This is especiallly true
of hunting and fishing, the gathering of wild fruits and grains, and
agriculture. But archeology alone can be depended upon to tell the
story of the industries concerned with developing the mineral
resources. These activities escaped the observation of the conquerors
and colonists and were discontinued so abruptly that very meager
records of their operation have been preserved. The story of the
struggles of primitive man in exploiting the valleys and mountains
and in extracting the staple materials of the stone-age culture from
their rocky beds forms one of the most interesting and important
chapters in the history of incipient civilization. With implements
of stone, bone, and wood the aborigines attacked the massive strata,
breaking up solid bodies of flint, quartz, obsidian, jasper, ete.,
for the manufacture of implements and carving out huge monoliths
from the living rock for building and sculpture. A study of the
American mines and quarries gives us a vivid conception of the
strength and persistence of the forces that underlie human develop-
ment, and of the difficulties encountered by the race in carrying culture
upward through the stone age to the higher level of the age of metal.
The shaping of the stone into implements and utensils supplemented
the work of the quarryman, and the story of the development is clearly
told in many lands. But America’s contribution to the history of this
most important branch of activity is exceptionally full and _ satis-
factory.

Architecture —Aboriginal architecture in America teaches the
lessons of the initial development of this branch of culture with
exceptional clearness, beginning at the lowest stage and carrying
it up to about the stage of the keystone arch. The present period
affords a wide range of phenomena representing the elementary forms
of building, and post-Columbian chronicles give us somewhat meager
elimpses of the higher development that came under the observation
of the Spanish conquerors, whilst archeologic remains supplement the
lessons of the historic period. We find constructions of great variety
and of remarkable preservation in the Mississippi valley, in the Pueblo
country, on the Mexican plateau, in Yucatan, Guatemala, and Hon-
‘luras, and in South America. By the aid of these we see how the
midden and the earth mound develop into the pyramid with its mul-
tiple stairways of cut stone; how the walls change from irregularly
placed stone, and clay-covered wicker to massive structures of accu-
rately hewn stone; how the chamber spaces, ceiled at first with weak
timbers subject to quick decay, are spanned later by the offset arch of
stone. We see supported on this native arch the concrete roof, so
massive as to defy the earthquake and support the forest growth of
suecessive centuries; we see the multiplication of stories, tier on tier ;
we see the spanned space, limited at first to a few feet, increase indefi-

CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY TO HUMAN HISTORY. 555

nitely to the many-vaulted roof supported by a wilderness of limestone
columns; we see walls decorated within and without with symbolic
sculptures, single buildings presenting thousands of square yards of
embellished surface, and marvel at lofty false fronts and roof crests
that were added to afford space for the exercise of the native genius
for decoration.

These chapters in the evolution of the building arts are not taught
with equal clearness and fullness in any other part of the world.
Besides the direct lessons which bear upon the history of the art of
architecture, many side hehts are thrown upon other branches of
primitive culture—mural decoration, sculpture, and furnishing, as
well as the organization of society, religious beliefs, and systems or
writing.

Sculpture.—Sculpture reached its highest development in Greece,
but the stages through which the art passed are but meagerly re-
~ corded in the extant art works of Hellas. The earlier steps are repre-
sented by isolated bits in many places, but the primitive phases of
the art are by no means so fully exhibited as in America. We have
there a vast body of material covering every stage from the very
beginning of stone-shaping up to full relief and realistic portrayal
of the human subject. No people known to us has within the ecul-
ture range of the Americans shown such versatility and power with
the hammer and chisel; none has embodied in stone a mythology so
rich in imagery, including as it does forms of men, beasts, mon-
sters, and cosmic phenomena in greatest variety. The archeologist
has here spread out before him, with the work of the living peoples
to guide him, as in an open book the whole story of the evolution of
sculptural phenomena within the horizon of barbarism.

Metallurgy—The working of metals is among the most impor-
tant activities of civilized man, and has been a chief agency in the
development of culture, as is especially manifest in gigantic forward
steps of recent years. Although the general course of metallurgic
development and the mutual relation of its successive stages of prog-
ress are well made out, much remains to be learned, and in this diree-
tion America is able to make the most valuable contributions. We
learn from history something of the metal work of the American
aborigines. Tin, lead, and iron were little known, and the smelting
of ores was in its infancy, but gold, copper, and silver were extensively
employed when the Spaniards arrived, and these metals were forged,
fused, cast, alloyed, plated, and otherwise handled with a skill that
astonished the conquerors Archeology verifies the statements of his
torians and adds much to our knowledge of the manipulation of
metals and of the forms produced in the primitive stages of culture.
not only in regard to the Western Continent, but for the general his-

tory of the subject at periods where the records in the Old World are
most defective.

Ceramics.—Of art in clay we may say much the same as of sculp-
ture. No people known to us has furnished such a vast body of
material for the study of this art from its beginnings up to the level
of glaze and the wheel as have the pre-Columbian Americans. The
clay took on a multitude of forms in which were embodied a wide
range of mythologic and esthetic concepts.

The graphic arts.—To the history of writing aboriginal America
makes many contributions, and these, lke the others referred to,
fall within that part of the history of progress wherein Old World
evidence is least satisfactory. In the Old World we trace back the
history of writing step by step to a point near the beginning of the
glyphic system. In the New World we pass back from the lower mar-
gin of the glyphic to the very beginning of the graphic, thus all but
completing the history of the evolution of the recording arts. ‘

With a knowledge of the present and prehistoric phases of picture
writing, it is easy to utilize and interpret the vast body of material
in this branch furnished by archeology; but, rich as is this material,
insufficient hght is thrown upon the transition from picture writing
to phonic writing, the particular stage of development in which
archeologists find one of the most fascinating fields of research. The
great body of evidence brought before the conquering Europeans
was not appreciated by them, but rudely destroyed, and the remains,
graphic and sculptural, are now being gathered together and studied
in the most painstaking manner by our scholars, who hope almost
against hope to find a key to the problems of transition. Within
the cluster of graphic phenomena which gave birth to writing, we
have evidence bearing upon other important branches. We here
get glimpses of the history of the calendar: we find traces of the
pictorial art, which had not yet reached the stage of light and shade,
perspective, and portraiture, and discover many germs of embellish-
ment, both mythologic and esthetic.

Although many of the obscure problems arising in this American
field have been successfully worked out, many others are still await-
ing the attention of Americanists and will no doubt yield, little by
little, to their persistent efforts.

The more important unsolved problems of aboriginal America are
those of race origins, of culture origins, and of chronology. These
problems do not relate so much to particular nations as to the history
of the race as a whole; not so much to peculiar or local cultures as to
the origin and evolution of the native activities; not so much to
tribal or national chronology as to correlations of race and culture
history with the geological time scale.

With respect to race and racial characters American archeology
CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY TO HUMAN HISTORY. 557

has as yet little to add to what may be learned from studies of the
living peoples. So far as observed, the variations in type of fossil
forms do not extend decidedly beyond the range of variation observed
among the living. It has been sought to establish a paleo- American
type in South America, but we are not certain that a sufficient
comparative study of the osseous remains of the present peoples of
the world has been made to warrant a satisfactory determination.
Conservatism is especially desirable in any attempt to establish new
‘acial types or special orders of culture.

Regarding race origin it may be said that there is still room for
speculation. Opinion seems, however, to be settling down to the view
that the American race, as it stands to-day, is not autochthonous, but
is an offshoot of Asiatic peoples, originally more or less diverse in
character and arriving in America, mainly at least, by the Bering
Strait route, not abruptly, but in the normal course of race distribu-
tion from a natal habitat, the migration continuing for untold cen-
turies. Americanists have here a difficult, a perplexing, but a most
fascinating, field of research.

To-day, one of the most absorbing questions encountered by the stu-
dent of American archeology is that of the origin of the aboriginal
cultures. Some regard these cultures as autochthonous; others have
looked for their source in many different parts of the world. Al-
though no final conclusion can yet be announced, we may assume that,
along with the incoming peoples, all or most of whom must have
been extremely primitive dwellers of the far north, there came the
simplest forms of the arts of hunting, fishing, shelter-building, and
the preparation of food; that from these elements, under the influence
of more southerly environments, there arose in time diversified cul-
ture groups, such as are now under investigation in various parts of
the continent. We can not but admit, however, the plausibility of
the theory that seafaring wanderers from other lands have now and
then reached American shores, bringing with them the germs of dis-
tinct cultures, and, further, that the characteristic art phenomena
of certain centers of progress are such as to give countenance to this
idea. This is a most interesting and important branch of archeolog-
ical research, and one with which archeologists must at this stage par-
ticularly concern themselves.

Archeology furnishes a vast amount of interesting data regarding
the states of culture of the American race, but we note that in all the
researches so far conducted no traces of culture phenomena have been
found which extend below, on the one hand, or above, on the other,
the range observed among the living or historic tribes. There is
nothing so unique that it might not belong to known tribes or their
immediate ancestors. It has been sought to differentiate a paleolithic
culture and period in America, but without tangible result. So far
558 CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY TO HUMAN HISTORY.

as the use of the terms * paleolithic ” and “ neolithic ” are concerned
they may both be omitted from the nomenclature of American arche-
ology without loss, if not to possible advantage. The simplest forms
of stone implements occur everywhere in association with the most
highly developed forms, and neolithic forms are reported from for-
mations of nearly all periods back to the earhest that have been
observed.

In America, especially North America, we have sought almost
in vain to establish a definite chronology of man and culture. Evi-
dence of antiquity 1s not wanting, but when we try to adjust the
phenomena to the geological time scale we meet with indifferent suc-
cess. Hundreds of ancient caves have been searched, with only nega-
tive results; glacial gravels have been examined with great care, but
the returns are exceedingly meager; river terraces and kitchen-inid-
den deposits yield nothing of particular value, and the results, when
viewed as a whole, instead of enlightening the mind, fill it rather with
confusion. It is within the bounds of possibility that this confusion
may in a measure be due to the presence in America of an autochtho-
nous race element.

The contributions of American archeology in this department are
not to be compared with those of the Old World, where definite
chronological results are forthcoming on all hands. That America
may yet furnish contributions of importance in this branch of in-
quiry, however, lies well within the bounds of possibility.

It is thus seen that there are in America numerous questions await-
ing solution, and there is vagueness in many places; but, notwith-
standing this, the results of our archeological investigations are on
the whole most gratifying. Each year the areas of the uncertain and
the unknown are being reduced, and when the results achieved are
supplemented by the rich materials derived from the study cf the
living peoples they must go far toward illuminating the pages of the
story of humanity in general which the Old World has been gradu-
ally but surely revealing.

Viewing the whole field of prehistorical research, we are struck
by the fact that the past of man is rapidly disclosing itself to our
vision, so that presently we shall be able to look backward through the
biological and cultural vistas of his coming and connect the present
with the vanishing point of the human perspective with «n insight
and comprehension little dreamed of until now.

INTRODUCTION.

‘There is a land called Crete in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a
fair land and a rich, begirt with water, and therein are many men
innumerable, and ninety cities —Odyssey, xrx, 172, Butcher and
Lang’s Translation.

The high expectations which scholars held of the good that would
come to archeology through systematic excavations in Crete have
not been disappointed. It is still too early to estimate the full valne
of the excavations which have been made by the British at Knossos,¢
Psychro,? Praesos,° Zakro,’ and Palaiokastroy by the Italians at
Phaestos* and Aghia Triadha,’ and by the American Exploration
Society at Gournia. Enough has been unearthed, however, in the
last four years to revolutionize our ideas of the state of culture
attained by the Cretans of the “ golden age” during the third and
second millenniums B. C., and to lay surer foundations for the study
of European.civilization than ever before existed. Further work will
no doubt bring many fresh surprises and will throw new light on the
origins of Mediterranean culture.

The great palaces at Knossos and Phaestos complete each other
architecturally, the former giving an elevation of three or even four
stories, the latter furnishing a ground plan “ simple and grandiose,”
as it has been called by Mr. Evans. In both we see the houses of
rich princes who loved luxury, who patronized the arts of builder,
sculptor, and painter, and used the talents of the scribe as well. The
smaller finds at Knossos and Aghia Triadha by their variety and
number give us a fuller knowledge of this prehistoric civilization
than we have of many a later stage of culture, but of this, as of most
subjects which deserve any investigation, the more we know the
more we want to know. Palaces ad tombs are not sufficient; we
want also the homes of the people, for without an insight into the life
of “the many” we can not rightly judge the civilization of any
period. By a singular chance a well-preserved town, dating from
the earlier period os the Great Palace at Knossos (about 1800-1590
B. C.) and containing a large quantity of tools, pottery, and other
articles of daily use, has been brought to light by the excavations of
Americans (* people of the great democracy,” as Cretans call us) at
Gournia, on the north shore of the isthmus that connects the east end
of the island with the rest of Crete. It is not rash to suppose that
this is one of the ninety cities mentioned by Homer in the famous
passage of the Odyssey quoted above.

THE ISTHMUS.

Strabo, in Book X, Ch. TV, 3, of his Geography, describes the long,
narrow island of Crete, with its northern coast line indented by deep
gulfs, which at two points reduce the island to less than half its
average width. At the Isthmus of Hierapetra, which is the eastern
of these two points and the narrowest portion of the island, the
northern and southern shores le but 60 stadia (12 kilometers, about
8 miles) apart. Here nature has made the communication between
sea and sea not only short, but easy, by leaving a narrow strip of
lowland between the mountain ranges of Dikte in Sitia and Dikte in
Lasithi (the legendary cradle of Zeus), a break in the long chain
that forms the backbone of Crete. East of the isthmus an almost
vertical rock wall of mountains hides from view the summit of
pe Kavousi, which dominates Sitia (1,472 meters, or about

1,829 feet), while across the valley to the west the land rises in more
ae ascent to mountain level, and from many foothills Aphendi
Khristos* (2,155 meters, or about 7,070 feet), the loftiest peak of
Lasithi, can be seen.

At the northeast corner of the isthmus, shut in by mountains on
the east and coast hills on the west, lies the plain of Kavousi. In

EXCAVATIONS AT GOURNIA, CRETE. 561

seasons of abundant rain like 1903 it gives good yields of olives,
rarobs, grapes, and grain; but in dry years like 1901 it is parched
and fruitless. More. fertile, because better watered, is the lovely
valley of Kalo Khorio, which occupies the northwest corner of the
isthmus, descending to the Gulf of Mirabello. Between Kavousi and
Kalo Khorio® the coast, though utterly barren, is wonderfully beau-
tiful. At Pachyammos there is a good beach; elsewhere steep cliffs,
alternating with coves, form a coast line as picturesque as any in
southern Europe, and within these coves rest waters as clear and
rich in color as those of Capri. The main highway of Crete, con-
necting Sitia, Herakleion (Candia), Rethymo, and Canea, follows
this coast and near Pachyammos meets the road that crosses the
isthmus from Hierapetra. Since the earliest times this isthmus road
must have been in constant use, for no other route across the island
is so short, so level, so direct. Halfway between the two seas stands
Episkopi, and side roads lead east to Monasteraki, Kato Khorio, and
Apano Khorio, at the foot of the Thriphte Range, and west to
Vasiliki and Kentri, situated on low hills. From Episkopi south
the lowland widens, and, being watered by mountain streams, is
richly productive of lemons, oranges, figs, and mulberries, as well as
of the commoner fruits and grains. This cheerful fertility continues
until the neighborhood of Hierapetra is reached, a region as barren
as the northern shore and far less interesting.

From time immemorial the isthmus has been inhabited, and yet it
is an interesting fact that with the exception of Mierapetra, where
the modern city is built above ruins of Hellenic and Roman cities
of the same name, the sites occupied at different periods are distinct ”
one from another. Men of the bronze age chose low hills not far
from the sea; their successors, a ruder people of the iron age, had
strongholds on almost inaccessible mountain heights; Greeks and
Romans established trading stations on the shore; Venetians and
Turks built watch towers and block houses at commanding points for
the purpose of holding the unfortunate Cretans in subjection ; mod-
ern Cretans still prefer the security of the hills, but a seaward move-
ment has already begun as a result of the peace and order that since
the liberation of Crete in 1898 have prevailed throughout the

me in 1901, wnen the American Exploration Society, of Philadelphia,
offered to support further researches in Crete. Mrs. Cornelius Stev-
enson, secretary of the society, actively forwarded the enterprise, and
Mr. Calvin Wells, of Pittsburg, and Mr. Charles H. Cramp, of Phila-
delphia, generously contributed the necessary funds. My colleague
in 1901 was Miss B. E. Wheeler, of Concord and Providence, one of
my classmates at Smith College. Miss Wheeler and I landed in Crete
April 7. Much progress had been made at Knossos and Phaestos,
and such suecess in the Myceneean and pre-Mycenean field, or, to use
more up-to-date nomenclature, the “ Minoan” field, increased our
longing to find something belonging to this golden age of Cretan
history.

We made a round trip through Chersonnesos (a Greco-Roman
city), Neapolis (the town from which one visits a difficult 1ron-age
site at Anarlachos and the Hellenic Deyros), Olunta (ancient city
Olus, near which he remains probably prehistoric), Gonlos (site of
the ancient city Lato and of an important prehistoric settlement),
Kavousi, Episkopi, Mesoleri (ancient Oleros), Kalamavka (reserved
by British as a prehistoric site), Mallais (Homeric Malla), Psychro,
and back to Herakleion. On this trip we saw nothing more promis-
ing than our clue at St. Anthony’s and the Cyclopean wall at Avgo,
and as Miss Wheeler was willing to try a second year’s luck on the
isthmus of Hierapetra, we informed the Government of our wish to
renew work in that region. The St. Anthony clue was too slight to
be mentioned save between ourselves, and when we returned to
Kayvousi presumably to find geometric or at best sub-Mycenzan
things, our quest excited pity rather than envy among the archeol-
ogists at Herakleion. .

We went directly to Avgo to learn the nature of the megalithic
structure near the Chapel of the Virgin. Avgo Valley is so over-
shadowed by the surrounding mountains that the sun does not reach
it until late, and the mornings and evenings are very cool. Conse-
quently the peasants live here only in summer and content themselves
with one-room stone huts without windows.

For two weeks our party living in these huts suffered some hard-
ships, especially during thirty-six hours of incessant rain that caused
serious floods in eastern Crete, wrecked a hut near us, loosened our
own walls, and poured into the hut we used for a kitchen. The
results of our excavations at Avgo were meager. On_ holidays
and on days when the ground was too wet for digging we rode
up and down Kavousi plain and the neighboring coast hill seek-
ing for the bronze-age settlement, which I was convinced lay in

these lowlands somewhere near the sea. It was discouraging work,
for my eyes soon’ came to see walls and the tops of beehive
tombs in every chance grouping of stones, and we went to many
a “rise of ground which at a distance looked a perfect Mycenean
hill, but proved to be all rock. From an archaeological, as well
as an agricultural, point of view the curse of the Ka-
vousi region is the shallowness of soil; even at Gournia
we often have occasion to bemoan it. At last the rumor
of our search reached the ear of George Perakis, peasant
antiquarian of Vasiliki, a village 3 miles west of Ka-
vousi, and he sent word by the schoolmaster that he
could guide us to a hill three-quarters of a mile west of
Pachyammos, close to the sea, where there were broken
bits of pottery and old walls. Moreover, he sent an ex-
cellent seal stone picked up near the hill, and although
seal stones are not good evidence, being easily carried
from place to place, his story was too interesting to pass
unheeded. Accordingly, on May 19, Miss Wheeler and
I rode to the spot, found one or two sherds with curvi-.
linear patterns, like those from St. Antonys; saw stone
in lines, which might prove to be parts of walls (never
more than one course visible), and determined to put
our force ef 30 men at work there the following day.
Three days later we had dug 19 trial pits and had
opened houses, were following paved roads, and were
in possession of enough vases and sherds, with cuttle-
fish, plant, and spiral designs, as well as bronze tools,
seal impressions, stone vases, ete., to make it certain that
we had a bronze-age settlement of some importance.
Accordingly, I sent the following cablegram to the
American Exploration Society, which was received in
Philadelphia four days after the first visit paid by me,
or, as far as I can learn, by any archeologist to the site
of Gournia: “ Discovered Gournia—Mycenean _ site,
street, houses, pottery, bronzes, stone jars.” We imme-
diately petitioned the Cretan Government for special ee aa
permission to excavate this new site for the American First “fina”
Exploration Society of Philadelphia, and our request Ree one tat
was promptly granted. .
Gournia is a name given by the peasants of the district to a basin
opening north on the Gulf of Mirabello and inclosed on the other three
sides by foothills which rise west of the narrow strip of isthmus.
For one-half its length from south to north this basin is divided into
two narrow valleys, of which the western forms a broad torrent bed,

dry in summer. The southern end of the ridge was used in Greco-
Roman times, for here in the chapel of Aghia Pelaghia is a stone bear-
ing the inscription “ Klythos made (it),” and close at hand graves
have been discovered containing Roman vases. This end of the ridge
being for the most part an irregular mass of limestone, is suitable, per-
haps, for burial, but not for habitation. Farther north the ridge be-
comes less rugged; platforms of earth are upheld by rock ledges; there
is a slight dip, and we stand on the acropolis of the ancient city; every
foot of its summit and slopes covered with roads and dwellings. But
the rock reappears at the northern point of the ridge, beyond which
the valleys meet and extend in one plain to the sea. The eastern valley
and a small part of the plain can be cultivated, but hills and shore
bear no crops except stones and low carob trees. The rugged charac-
ter of the ridge and the dense growth of carobs which covered it made
it possible for the acropolis to escape the notice of passing archeolo-
gists, although many had traveled along the important highway from
Herakleion to Sitia, which actually crosses the lower part of our site
and les within one-eighth of a mile of the acropolis itself. The higher
hills south and southwest of Gournia are composed of pudding stone,
which easily breaks off in shallow caves, while the lower hills are of
hmestone, like the ridge.

Our town, which until we know its ancient name must be called
by the modern designation Gournia, covered not only the middle of
the ridge, where it rises 200 feet above sea level, one-quarter of a mile
back from the gulf, but extended across the eastern valley up the
hills to the east and northeast, so that the acropolis was the center of
a settlement of considerable size. To-day the nearest harbor is at
Pachyammos, a small coast-guard station three-quarters of a mile
east of Gournia. This place seems destined to grow to an important
port. An excellent road, built by French soldiers during the recent
international occupation of Crete, connects it with Hierapetra, on the
south coast, only 8 miles distant, and this land connection between
the two seas across the narrowest portion of the island is preferred
to rounding Sitia, where storms are frequent and severe. The line
of the north shore has changed, and it may be that in early times the
harbor lay in an arm of the sea directly north of Gournia. At all
events, the sea has here encroached on buildings which are proved by
construction and by contents to be of the same period as those on the
ridge. From this group of buildings a road probably led up to the
low acropolis, and on reaching the middle eminence must have met
a road which we have found continues on both the east and west sides
of the hill, rising by steps where the slope is steep, and conducting
the traveler at length to the small palace of the local governor.

At the beginning of excavations only a few stones showed above the
surface and many houses were entirely hidden, being discovered in

the course of digging by workmen who, following the roads, came
upon their thresholds.» The upper parts of the houses had fallen long
ago, covering the hill with their ruins. On the top of the hill, where
denudation is constant, there was but a scant covering of earth over
the native rock; here some of the best objects of bronze and terra
cotta were found within 50 centimeters of the surface, and, indeed, at
certain spots, which we now know to have been within dwellings, the
native rock lay bare. On the sides of the hil) where earth accumu-
lates we were often obliged to dig + or 5 meters before reaching virgin
sou, live rock, beaten floor, or stone paving, as the case might be.

Excavations have been carried on at Gournia through two cam-
paigns, May 20 to July 2, 1901, and March 30 to June 6, 1903, with a
force of 100 to 110 workmen and about a dozen girls who wash pot-
sherds. Unfortunately, Miss Wheeler could not leave America in
1903 to give her efficient aid toward the accomplishment of the work
which we had started and planned together; but I was ably assisted
in the second season by Mr. Richard B. Seager, who took special
charge of the pottery as well as helping in the field. Miss Moffat, of
Northampton, Mass., left a Paris studio to accompany the second
year’s expedition, and has made for the American Exploration Society
a series of excellent colored drawings of some of the better vases and
scores of drawings to scale of the commoner pottery, saving thereby
many shapes which, through the inferiority of the common clay, would
have been lost. I consider these drawings and others executed for us
by the Danish artist, M. Bagge, among the most important contribu-
tions which have been made to archeology by our expedition.

The brief survey of results to be given here is strictly provisional,
and will, I hope, be superseded by a more careful study of the work
when the excavations at Gournia shall have been completed.

THE TOWN AND ITS BUILDINGS.

The sketch plan reproduced in the accompanying illustration,
begun in 1901 by Mr. Fyfe, of Glasgow, architect for Mr. Evans at
Knossos, and finished by me in 1903, with the help of Mr. Harold
Hastings, gives a better idea of the town than words can. As the
squares measure 20 meters on a side, the entire area cleared may be
roughly computed as 2 acres, the top of the acropolis as about 1 acre,
and the palace as one-third of an acre. Thirty-six houses and parts
of several others are uncovered.

The roads of Gournia have an average width of about 1.60 meters
and are paved with stones which seem to have been chosen from
near the sea, and which, worn first by the sea and then by the passing
of many feet, present a fairly smooth surface. They are laid with
care, not actually fitting, but leaving no such ruts and holes as are
566 EXCAVATIONS AT GOURNIA, CRETE.

seen in Cretan roads to-day. Where the roads ascend we find flights
of steps as in modern Naples; the longest flight is in the road that
climbs the east slope.

Gournia houses are superior to any homes of bronze age people
found on the Greek mainland. Their lower courses are of rubble,
but often considerable care is taken in the choice of stones, and
they are roughly aligned. The size of stones varies greatly—cer-
tain walls on the east slope of the hills being sufficiently massive to
have suggested on first discovery fortification walls, but as further
digging disclosed massive and weak walls side by side, we came to
the conclusion, in which all who have visited the site agree, that
the heavier construction belongs simply to the better-built houses
and that the place is unfortified. The width of the house walls
raries from 50 to 90 centimeters, 60 centimeters being the average.
That the upper walls of many of the houses are of brick is abun-
dantly ‘proved. These bricks average 40 by 380 by 10 centimeters,
and seem to be fire baked. Before May, 1901, only sun-baked bricks,
or those accidentally burned by conflagration had been found in
bronze age settlements in the A%gean; but almost simultaneously
at Zakro at the extreme east end of the island, where Mr. Hogarth
was conducting successful excavations, at Avgo, and at Gournia
fire-baked bricks came to hight in May, 1901, and they have since
been found at Palaiokastro. The clay is coarse and unevenly baked,
but the bricks retain their shape well. Bricks were used not only
in upper walls, but also in partitions—always on a stone base. In
a house on the east slope we found partition walls made of mud,
which, after drying in the sun, was overlaid with plaster, a careless
construction not uncommon in modern Greek villages. The marvel
is that such flimsy work should have remained sufficiently intact for
thirty-five hundred years to be immediately recognized and preserved
by the workmen who dug it out.

Plaster is employed extensively on the door jambs and on the
walls, both outer and inner, overlaying stone and brick. It is of
several varieties, a coarse white kind and a gray pebbly sort being
commonest. In some instances a coarse plaster covers the wall and
a second finer layer covers this, the color of the finer layer being
usually a very light bluish gray, although we have a few precious
bits of brighter stucco of a shade somewhat deeper than the Pom-
peian red. In one of the western storerooms of the palace we found
two small curiously molded pieces of stucco, one shaped as a thun-
derbolt and the other as a swallow; these have one flat surface,
as if they might have formed ornaments in relief on the wall.

Doorways are carefully made with stone sills and bases for the
jambs, which were in rare instances of stone covered with plaster,
sometimes of wood, often of brick clay plastered over. A shapeless

EXCAVATIONS AT GOURNIA, CRETE. 567

mass of bronze, evidently reduced by heat, lay in a doorway of the
palace, and may have formed a part of the trimmings of the door.
Asa rule the house walls are not sufficiently high for windows to have
been preserved, but three openings in walls on the east slope were
certainly intended to admit light and air. Floors were made of
beaten earth, “ terrazza” (a cement of pebbles covered with a layer
of plaster), stone slabs, or paving stones like those in the roads. As
for roofs, the evidence seems all in favor of the flat terrace forms
common to-day in the East. Pieces of plaster still bearing impres-
sions of reeds show what the ceiling must have been. In a ground-
floor room of the palace a large tree trunk was found fallen and
burned, completely charred through, but retaiing its original shape;
this supported either the flooring of the upper story or the roof. The
central hall of the palace was choked with such timbers.

In plan the houses are simple, conforming to the lay of the land
‘rather than to a fixed form. When similarity of plan can be detected,
as in certain houses on the east slope, the arrangement is modern
rather than classical and is in agreement with the mosaic pictures of
Minoan houses found in the palace of Knossos in 1902. As in the
mosaic, so at Gournia we see the houses built flush with the streets
and usually provided with a good stone threshold; crossing this we
enter a paved antechamber with doors leading to the ground-floor
rooms and steps mounting to the second story; cellar steps may de-
scend directly from the antechamber or from an inner room. Certain
cellar rooms are finished in plaster and provided with doors; others
were entered, if at all, by ladders from above and can have served
only for storerooms; still others were mere substructures. Several
houses on the east slope have open courts which seem to have been
generally omitted in the private dwellings on the top of the hill for
lack of space. We know that there were second stories, because five
stone staircases are well preserved and the former existence of wooden
steps at many other points is clearly indicated. Moreover, many ob-
jects, and these usually the best, were found in the earth at varying
heights above the floor level, and except where there was proof that
these had stood on a wooden shelf, since rotted away or burned, they
must have fallen from an upper story.

No satisfactory explanation has vet been given for a stone object
which is very often found just within the street door. It looks like a
large mortar, and either stands upon the paved floor or is sunk
beneath it to the rim. It would make an awkward basin, for there
is no way of removing water except by dipping; on the other hand,
its position, invariably close to the outer door, makes us think that it
raust have served some other purpose than the one of pounding and
grinding which its form suggests, or at least that some special sig-
nificance was attached to its use. No pestle has yet been found with
568 EXCAVATIONS AT GOURNIA, CRETE.

it, although smaller pestles and mortars are among our commonest
finds.

Special mention, should be made of the palace. On the west
side are four storerooms communicating with a flight of steps, and
three long, narrow magazines opening on a common corridor that
correspond, though on a much smaller scale, to those at Knossos and
Phaestos. The rooms south of these magazines were reached by a
staircase, of which the steps are destroyed, but a transverse support-
ing wall still remains. West of the storerooms the road widens into
a small plateia, of which we have not yet determined the western
boundary. South of this is a space, having a cement pavement, which
seems to be part of the palace, possibly a loggia, in which case the
west road continuing south must have formed a covered way within
the palace. From the southern end of this covered way a paved
passage leads east, while the road continues southwest. The eastern
passage ends in three steps as-
cending east and a return series
of two steps which communi-
cated with the building south of
the passageway. Beyond the
three steps is a large open court,
which seems to answer to the
west court of Knossos, and may
have served as a market place
for the town. This court was
paved with cement; its eastern
and southern limits are not yet
; eis sea us reached. As we turn north
Fra. 2.Sacred horns (coarse terra cotta). from the steps we see on the left

running north for a distance of
5.60 meters a stylobate, on which stood two square pillars, measuring
85 centimeters on a side at the base, with shafts about 20 centimeters
less in dimensions. Of the southern pillar nothing remains, but its
position can be distinctly traced on the stylobate; of the northern
pillar we still have the base and lower part of the shaft. The profile
of the base is carefully cut.

Beginning March 30, 1903, at this portico, from which we had
removed our last loads of earth in 1901, we dug northward into the
center and, as it proved, the most interesting part of the palace. In
the northwest corner of the court we came upon two low flights of
steps at right angles to each other, which reproduce the arrangement
at Knossos and Phaestos. Within their angle a pair of sacred horns,
fashioned in coarse terra cotta, measuring 0.38 centimeter across and
0.38 centimeter in height, lay as if fallen from above. The flight of

EXCAVATIONS AT GOURNIA, CRETE. 569

steps leading west gives access to the interior of the palace. With-
out trying for the present to explain a huge single block of stone near
the top of the steps that may have been the floor of a bath, we may
turn northward, cross a threshold 1 meter wide and 2 meters long,
and following a corridor that runs first west and then north, enter
an inner court paved with cement (* terrazza ”’) and open to the sky.
The west side of this inner court was formed by a line of storerooms
mentioned above, which he on a somewhat lower level; north of the
court are more storerooms, a corridor leading to the west entrance of
the palace, a well-preserved bath, and a small staircase to the second
story. On a step of this staircase stood a three-legged stone basin,
too heavy to be saved by the owners or easily looted by an enemy.

The east side of the inner court opens through a portico composed
of two square pillars alternating with two round on a square hall,
which was certainly covered, as it was choked with fallen timbers,
masses of plaster, and stone slabs that in Minoan houses, as in many
Italian houses to-day, made the flooring of the second story. In the
southeast corner of the hall is a rectangular recess with a stone bench
around three sides and a round base for a column that must have sup-
ported an architrave across the open side. Here we may suppose the
prince sat to receive his friends and to dispense justice. It is a semi-
public part of the palace, corresponding to the throne room at Knos-
sos. No doubt the private rooms were on the second story. To them
a narrow flight of stairs led from the northeast corner of the hall.
The walls of this hall are carefully built of well-squared blocks of
soft limestone, like those used in the more important parts of the
outer walls of the building. At first we were astonished to find im-
mediately adjoining this important hall on the north one square and
two oblong storerooms, the square room containing 12 huge pithoi,
one of which is still perfect; but reflection shows that this arrange-
ment is a good one, for if the hall was semipublic and was an eating
hall for retainers it would be convenient to have * cellar” and pantry
at hand.

A part of the hill was cut away to give a level floor for the hall
and the adjoining rooms, and on the east the ground les 6 or 8 feet
higher. Here on the top of the hill no soil could accumulate to pro-
tect the ancient structure, and a careful scouring down to live rock
simply proved that there had been nothing lower than the second-
floor level between the hall and some narrow rooms of “ magazine
type” on the extreme eastern limit of the palace, where the land
again descends, and that of the second story not even a vestige re-
mains. To the south of the palace, as here described, Hes a building
of many rooms, which may form a southern wing (possibly the
women’s quarters) or may be the beginning of a block of houses. It

.
570 EXCAVATIONS AT GOURNIA, CRETE.

contains a bath with cement floor and stuccoed wall, on which traces
of red and yellow color are still visible, a small square court, several
storerooms, and a deep cistern with water channel.

In all the more important parts of the palace squared blocks of
soft limestone take the place of rubble; usual dimensions about 1.40
meters long, 90 centimeters wide, and 60 centimeters high. One
block attains the length of 2.10 meters. These blocks are carefully
trimmed on all sides, and are laid in a thin bed of clay, each course
receding about 10 centimeters from the one below it. The outer face
was covered with stucco, and we have some traces of its use or the
inner walls also. On a block near the southwest corner the dc
ax of Zeus is carved, as at Knossos and Phaestos. We note also ”
reentrant angles, a feature of Cretan architecture of this period.

Of the shrine which lies in the center of the town, approachce
a well-worn road of its own, I shall say very little, as it opens uy
large a subject for discussion here. Not imposing as a piece of a
tecture, it is yet of unique importance as being the first “ Mycena. .
or “ Minoan” shrine discovered intact. The worshiper ascendea
three steps and, through a doorway 1.50 meters wide, entered an in-
closure about 3 meters square, surrounded by walls half a meter
thick and 50 to 60 centimeters high. ‘The floor is of beaten earth.
Lying near the top of the hill, our shrine has suffered much from the
forces of nature. A wild carob tree growing within its bounds had
partly destroyed and partly saved its contents, of which the more
noteworthy are a low earthen table, covered with a thin coating of
plaster, which stands on three legs and possibly served as an altar;
four cultus* vases bearing symbols of Minoan worship, the disk,
consecrated horns and serpent, a terra-cotta female idol entwined
with a snake, two heads of the same type as the idol, several small
clay doves and serpents’ heads, all of coarse terra cotta, and a frag-
ment of a pithos, on which a double-ax and disk are modeled in re-
lief. These were huddled together in the northeast corner; the rest
of the shrine was entirely empty of finds, and nothing stood in the
recess at the southwest corner, although this seems to correspond to
the shelf in the shrine more recently discovered at Knossos, on which
were found many offerings.

aT have called them “ cultus” vases, and such I do believe them to be in
spite of Wide’s article on Mykenische Gétterbilder, in Idole Athenische Mittheil-
ungen, XXVI, 1901, pp. 247-257, in which he calls similar objects from Prinia
“idols.” These resemble ring stands found in Egypt, and with their slightly
flaring rims would conveniently hold bowls. Objects with the same rings, flar-
ing bases, and flaring rims have been found at Orchomenos and elsewhere in
Greece and the islands, but none of this height. The Gournia vases are fur-
nished with two opposite sets of upright loops, with an upright handle between
them.

Of tombs we haye as yet found no trace at Gournia, although vig-
orous search has been made for them, but we have signs of intramural
burial on the north spur of the acropolis, where within an inclosure
resembling a house we uncovered the bottoms of three casellas (aver-
age length 1 meter), together with many human bones, three bronze
knives, and a thin tip piece of beaten gold, without pattern, as large
as the end of a thumb. Fragments of two other casellas were un-
earthed about 7 meters north of this point. But on this north spur
of the acropolis the soil is never more than 30 centimeters deep, and
this readily explains why of the casellas only the bottoms and 5 or 6
centimeters of the sides were preserved, why the bones were scat-
tered, and why no more objects were found with them. Within the
north room of house 6 on the west road, 1 meter below the surface,
we came upon a better preserved casella decorated with a link pat-
tern of debased type, and close to it a grotesque mourning female
figure in coarse terra cotta similar to figures found in Cypriot tombs.
I believe that these objects were deposited in this house at a period
distinctly later than that of the settlement itself, and it may be that
the casellas on the north spur are also late, although too little remains
to establish a proof.

ARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCHES ON THE FRONTIER OF
ARGENTINA AND BOLIVIA IN 1901-02.¢

By Eric von ROSEN,
Stockholm.

In the spring of 1901 an expedition left Sweden, under the leader-
ship of Baron Erland Nordenskidld, for the Argentine Republic and
Bolivia. Of that expedition I became a member, for the purpose of
carrying on archeological and ethnographical research. Time does
not admit of my sketching here the course of the expedition, and that
is the less necessary as Baron Nordenskidld has already published
several essays in which an account of its doings has appeared; I at
once, therefore, pass on to describe the archeological results I was
able to obtain during the progress of the expedition.

About 3,500 meters above the sea, at the foot of the chain of moun-
tains that border on the west the lofty plain of Puna de Jujuy in
northern Argentina, a farm, Casabindo, is situated. The district
round, now desolate and almost desertlike, was nevertheless at one
time inhabited by numbers of people. Evidence of that fact exists in
the very numerous remnants of huts, corrals, and irrigation terraces.
These monuments of a by-gone civilization have long been known to
exist, and Doctor Uhle visited the place on one of his journeys, yet,
save for Doctor Lehmann-Nitsche’s Catalogue of the Puna Collection
in the La Plata Museum and some statements in Ambrosetti’s essay,
entitled “Antiguedades Calchaquies,” nothing has up to the present
been published relative to Casabindo.

About 1 kilometer north of the farm there are some heights,
formed of a tolerably loose species of rock resembling sandstone.
Owing to weathering and the etfect of the wind, grettolike excava-
tions of varying dimensions have been formed in the rock in the proc-
ess of time; many of these grottoes have in earlier times been used as
burial places. On plate 1, figures 1, 2, we see photographs of one of

those grottoes, showing, in the corner, a skeleton which I unearthed.
The grottoes average about 1.5 meters in depth and about 2 meters
in height at the entrance. The rock forming the foundation of the
grotto slopes usually downward from the entrance, but rises again
farther in, so that a longitudinal section shows that the floor, the
inner wall, and the roof of the grotto together form a curve which
nearly approximates to two-thirds of the circumference of a circle.
Thus the floor of the grotto 1s markedly concave in form; it is cov-
ered with a layer of sand, usually of a depth of as much as one meter
at the deepest part. In that layer the corpse is found deposited in a
sitting posture, or else, where there was not a sufficient depth of sand,
in a lying one, but always with the legs bent up and pressed upon the
chest, so that the chin and knees almost touch. I have not observed
that the corpse was systematically placed facing any particular point
of the compass. In front of the entrance to the grotto there is often
to be seen a semicircular arrangement of stones, piled in several
courses, one on top of another; that was presumably a precautionary
measure against the removal of the sand by the blowing of the wind.
Asa rule, I found only one skeleton in each grotto, but in some there
were up to the number of three. In some graves the dead had house-
hold utensils, ete., lying beside them, though in only one of the graves
which I examined was there any trace of clothes. As the layer of
sand in the graves has never been exposed to the influence of any
damp to speak of, a number of the corpses, instead of rotting away,
have merely dried up; they resemble mummies in appearance. It
seems to me scarcely probable that any species of embalming was
resorted to; it must, indeed, have been superfluous, inasmuch as the
articles of wood and other perishable or destructible substances
which I found in the grottoes are in remarkably good preservation.

I succeeded in collecting a fairly large number of specimens of
skeletons, both of adults and children. Professor Retzius is at pres-
ent studying them, and he informs me that all the heads from here
bear evidence of having been artificially deformed to a greater or
less extent. The hairs upon them are coal-black, coarse, but not
very stiff. Round one of the heads there was a curious bandage
of Hama wool. The body to which this skull belongs was wrapped
round in two woven mantles, one of a very delicate texture, worked
in a strange pattern and of an exceedingly pretty color; the other
coarser and very thick. The finer one is probably of vicuna wool,
and was woven in a peculiar manner, whereby the threads were
made to follow the pattern. Consequently the threads in some
places are very closely packed together, in others wider apart. The
coarser mantle is of lama wool. Close to the skin of the dead body
1 found remnants of a garment of some thin material, originally
white in color.

As already mentioned, in the majority of cases articles had been
deposited in the graves with the dead bodies; as a rule these arti-
cles consisted of a bowl, some corncobs, and a cup, which at the
time of the burial was probably filled with water, as is the custom to
this day among the Chorotes Indians. Some graves, however, were
more plentifully supplied with similar articles, as small cups of
burnt clay, clay bottles with painted ornamentation, a small red
clay bottle of a beautiful shape and of a fine material, a clay bowl
with a handle in the shape of an animal’s head. At the bottom
of this bowl there is a black cross, painted, and with arms of equal
size. Some corncobs were found in the bowl. In one grave two cups
of exactly the same size and appearance were found, cut out of one
piece of a hard kind of wood (pl. 1x, fig. 3); the exterior is richly
adorned with engraved ornaments. The discovery so far from the
sea of some shells of marine mussels, probably used as spoons, 1s
remarkable. In these graves were further found a bone = case
containing cactus prickles, used doubtless in tattooing, as is still
the case among the Chorotes; an instrument flattened like a spoon
at one end; some of the so-called Hama bits. It is possible that the
objects in question were actually used for that purpose, but if so
JT presume that they were not placed in the animal’s mouth, but
across its nese, for I have not been able to discover any trace of
wear by the teeth on any of the numerous specimens I have come
across. On one of the “bits” of the same description there is a
rein of llama wool fastened to it.

Outside most of the grave grottoes I found that the sand for a
somewhat limited area around was mingled with splinters of pottery,
pieces of chipped stone, bones of animals, charcoal, etc. These
collections of remnants of a bygone civilization each extended over
an area of at the utmost 15 square meters; in places they were as
much as one-half meter in depth. That dwelling places and graves
were found so close together goes to show that the custom preva-
lent, for instance, among the Chiriguano Indians of burying the
dead near their residences was general in this portion of the Puna,
too. In the collections spoken of above I came upon some clay
vessels of rather larger size than the generality. Besides splinters
of pottery, chipped stone, charcoal, corncobs, and sundry bones of
llamas, ete., I also found there arrow and lance heads, axes, spindle
whorls, stone beads, etc. The axes or parts of axes discovered there
were made of schist and were all of approximately the same type.
One of the axes is about 15 millimeters thick and the edge has been
sharpened on one side. Some of the other axes found there, how-
ever, had their edges sharpened on both sides. Ambrosetti and
Lehmann-Nitseche describe implements of an exactly similar char-
acter, but they do not seem to have found any trace of the axes
576 ARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCHES IN ARGENTINA AND BOLIVIA.

having been provided with handles. I made the discovery, how-
ever, very soon, that the implement had had a handle, for on several
of the specimens I obtained there were plain marks of friction against
some hard object on one of the surfaces of the projecting part,
which itself resembled a handle. On some of the axes is plainly
to be seen that the wooden handle has produced a shallow, level
furrow in the stone (pl. vin, fig. 4). Subsequently I found in
another grave a handle bent at an acute angle and shaped at one
end for fastening the ax more securely to it. I placed one of the
axes before described in contiguity to this handle, and thereby con-
vinced myself that the worn surface on the ax very closely corre-
sponded to the level surface of the handle; the two parts were prob-
ably united together by means of something wound around them
or by being incased in leather. It is possible that resin or some
other adhesive substance may have been employed to prevent the
ax gaping; the fact of its having been insecurely attached is, how-
ever, amply proved by the considerable amount of wear shown on
the handle.

The fragile material of which the ax is made renders it an 1mpos-
sibility that it can have been used for dealing with any hard sub-
stance; on the other hand, this ax would be an admirable implement
for peeling off the soft exterior of the pillar cactuses, when the hard
internal stem of the plant is to be got at. With the trifling exception
of small bushes and the Polylepis racemosa, which resembles a shrub,
and, moreover, occurs very sparsely, there do not exist any trees but
the cactuses in the whole of the Puna that yield wood for manufac-
turing purposes or for fuel. These cactuses (pl. m1, fig. 1) attain a
respectable growth. The adaptability of the wood of the cactus for
manufactures is shown both by the loom (pl. m1, fig. 1) made of cac-
tus wood and by the door (pl. 1, fig. 2) of the same material.

About 8 kilometers northwest of Casabindo, in a narrow valley,
there are numbers of remains of round stone huts. They are, indeed,
so numerous that we may well assume that a population of several
thousands dwelt here. Stone huts of a similar appearance are still
used in the Puna, though only sparsely. The illustration (pl. m1,
fig. 2) shows a modern hut of the kind. The roof timbers are of
‘actus wood, covered with sticks and straw. The valley leading from
Casabindo to the ruined city is hemmed in by fairly steep slopes,
covered almost throughout with stone terraces of from 1 to 2 meters
in height and of similar appearance to the irrigation terraces of the
Inca period, which are so common in Peru. Plate rv, figure 1, repre-
sents a terraced mountain slopé at Casabindo. Plate ry, figure 2, shows
a small grotto, the entrance to which has been blocked up with a
stone wall. Grottoes of that kind are of very general occurrence in
the vicinity of the irrigation terraces. At the foot of the wall there

was a rectangular opening large enough for a man just to manage to
creep through. A couple of walled-up grottoes of a similar character
to this one were investigated by me, but they proved to be empty, and
their object is a puzzle to me. Ambrosetti has described a grotto of
the kind, but he, too, is unable to arrive at any satisfactory explana-
tion of the use to which they were put, although he is inclined to con-
sider them emptied graves.

Near the ruined city just mentioned I came upon an urn of burnt
clay deposited in the ground and containing the dried-up corpse of a
child with a deformed head. The mouth of the urn was covered with
a clay plate turned upside down. The child had its sandals buried
with it and a rattle, consisting of the fruit of the Juglans australis
that grows in Chaco. A clay dish, containing some corncobs and a
couple of bowls of pumpkin rind, had also been deposited in the urn.
Beneath a projecting slab of rock, quite close to the above-described
grave, I came upon another, containing several skeletons and numer-
ous objects, as a clay vessel, a bowl of pumpkin rind, a wooden spoon,
small spindle whorls of wood, an implement in the shape of a knife of
some hard wood, a bar of wood with remnants of a fiber tie attached.
The Chorotes Indians have an implement which they use for carrying
fish about in and which in appearance exactly resembles this; further,
a club or mallet, a diminutive club, a bow, a miniature bow, an ax
handle, a miniature ax handle, a square slab of palm wood, and a bag
of leather. This bag contained bars of wood that show evident
traces of having been employed in kindling a fire. A more detailed
account of the procedure, as observed among the present-day Chaco
Indians, I propose to give in my lecture upon the Chorotes. In the
same grave I further found a well-preserved sandal of almost the
same type as those used now in the Puna; small leather bags, contain-
ing red, yellow, and green pigments; implements of copper; a thin
sheet of copper; an interesting implement of copper (pl. vit, fig. 3),
and a whetstone.

Adjacent to those objects, which are of pure Indian origin, I also
found a wind instrument made of cow horn, and the remains of a
small knife of iron with a wooden handle. These two articles prove
that the ruined city at Casabindo was still inhabited at the period of
the Conquista.

At Cangrejillos, in the most northerly part of the Puna, I came
upon a dwelling place of considerable size with numerous remains
of stone huts. Here was found, among other things, a stone ax of
exactly the same type as the Casabindo axes. At Chani, too, in South
Puna, I came upon remains of large-sized villages, one of them at a
height of nearly 5,000 meters above the sea. At the topmost summit
of the same mountain, at 6,100 meters elevation above the sea, my com-

panions, Herr Von Hofsten and Doctor Fries, found remains of two
carefully constructed W4-shaped cromlechs, partially covered over
with snow. Within the compass of one of the cromlechs there were
found a cylindrical bead of blue mineral as hard as glass, and some
splinters of pottery of the same appearance as those common in the
dwelling places in the Puna. Pieces of cactus wood were also found.
It is uncertain whether there was a signaling station here or a place
of sacrifice. Owing to the rarefaction of the air, my two peons were
unable to proceed to the top. I pushed on alone to the top of one
of the peaks, where I took photographs at a height above the sea of
about 6,000 meters. Plate v, figures 1 and 2, represent species of
sacrificial erections in use among the Puna Indians at the present
dav; the first is dedicated to the goddess Pachamama, and is formed
of stone which are thrown up by every passer-by; the other is in the
form of a kind of miniature house, in which chewed cocoa is
offered up.

In Quebrada del Toro I visited at Ojo de Agua a dwelling place
of very considerable extent. The slope forming the eastern wall of
the valley was dotted over with the foundation walls of huts of a
rectangular shape; on the western slope, on the other hand, there
were none. In digging up a mound on the western side I found
numerous graves; consequently that side had been reserved for the
dead.

The grave mound is about 13 meters high and 36 meters in
diameter. The graves may have been originally marked above the
surface of the earth by circles of small stones. I found traces of them
at the top of the mound. The mound had evidently, in the process
of time, sunk considerably; I could judge that that was so by the
skeletons and objects buried there being found in all sorts of posi-
tions. Professor Retzius informs me that the heads from this locality,
too, are deformed. Many objects were here found in the graves. It
is worthy of remark that.in almost every grave rattles, consisting of ,
the fruit of the Juglans australis, were met with. A specimen of the
same description was also found, as I have above pointed out, in the
erave of a child at Casabindo. Clay vessels of different types were
very common. In addition to a number of other objects resembling
those found in the graves at Casabindo T also came upon some imple-
ments here which deserve a special mention, as a sort of wooden
knives of different sizes, the greater ones (pl. rx, figs. 1, 2) used
possibly as knives in battle. ‘The wood in them is particularly heavy
and hard, and was undoubtedly brought from Chaco. Some comblike
instruments of wood, one of which is shown in plate 1x, figure 4, were
often found. As to the use they were put to, however, I do not ven-
ture even upon a guess. Plate 1x, figure 5, shows a copper imple-
ment with wooden handle. Implements of that kind, but lacking

wooden handles, are common enough among the finds in graves in
the Puna and neighboring districts. This is the first time they have
ever been discovered with their wooden handles still attached to them.
There is nothing to show that the handle was bound on with thread or
was incased in leather; hence one must assume that the copper im-
plement retained its place in the handle by reason of the pressure of
the hand holding it. It is my opinion that these implements were
used in cutting out leather.

Before drawing this account to a close, I desire to make mention
of a dwelling place that I came upon at Tolomosa, quite close to
Tartyja;/1o Bou ia. This dwelling place was far larger, both in
extent and in wealth of relics of the past, than any of those I have
previously described, and derives, moreover, a special interest from
the fact that nothing as regards the archeology of that neighbor-
hood was known before. Owing to the loose nature of the soil,
however, and to the tropical rains, all the remains of foundation
walls, ete., had been destroyed. The picture of plate vr and on plate.
vit, figure 1, show how the ground, by reason of its loose consistency,|
has been scored and furrowed by the rain, so as to produce the most
marvelous shapes and figures in its surface. The ground, however,
there was dotted almost all over, for an area of upward of a square
kilometer, with splinters of pottery, arrowheads, spindle whorls,
ornaments, copper implements, ete., while here and there the rain
had partially uncovered urns, which it was then possible to dig out
of the soil that still encompassed them. To give an idea of the
abundance of relics with which the ground around this dwelling
place was strewn, I may mention that, among other things, I found
upward of 8,000 artistically beaten arrowheads (pl. x, figs. 1 to 5,
7 to 9, 12, 15, and 17) of almost every type, made of flint, obsidian,
chalcedony, and rock crystal, and upward of 500 spindle whorls of
stone of 24 distinct main types (pl. x, figs. 14, 16, and 18). Further
urns of the type which is characteristic of this locality (pl. vi, fig.
1). An urn of an approximately similar appearance is figured in
Doctor Lehmann-Nitsche’s catalogue of the finds in the Puna.¢

Some other clay vessels of different types were also found. One
who is figured on plate vin, figure 2, is of a shape that is very com-
mon in Peru. Among other finds, I may mention mortars of stone,
a grinding stone with two handles, stone rings, in some cases evi-
dently used as club heads. Further, some pendants in the shape of
animal figures (see pl. x, figs. 11, 13), a rattlesnake carved in bone
(pl. x, fig. 6), and phallus-like pendants of stone (pl. x, fig. 10)
and pun clay. A few spec imens of copper ware such as rings

for the arms and for the fingers, pins with heads shaped to resemble
the Llama’s, pierced metal disks, implements of the same type as
those common in the Puna, and fragments of tweezers—were also
found. Some of the copper specimens I have had analyzed, with
the result that the material of which they are made is pronounced
to be of sterling quality, with but trifling traces of any impurities.
The finds from Tolomosa, as well as the other collections I made
during the progress of the expedition, are undergoing examination,
and I trust I may be able to complete my work upon them in the
near future. The collections are all at the ethnological section
of the Riksmuseum in Stockholm.

To judge by the finds from the various dwelling places, it would
seem as though Ojo de Agua and Casabindo were inhabited by the
same tribe, or at all events by tribes nearly related to each other,
while in the Tarija Valley, on the other hand, there would appear to
have dwelt a population considerably dissimilar to those in the above-
enumerated localities. The majority of the specimens found in the
graves at Ojo de Agua have counterparts among the finds from Casa-
bindo, e. g., lama bits, bows, implements and ornaments of copper,
etc. Common to both localities was the custom of depositing walnut
rattles in the graves. These rattles, whose place of origin must have
been far-distant wooded regions, were possibly obtained by way of
barter with some tribe of the Chaco Indians, or were cherished as
relics in commemoration of warlike raids into far-off territories.
The find of marine mussels proves that the inhabitants of the Puna
must have come into contact with tribes who lived far removed from
them. The custom of burying children in clay vessels was preva-
lent both at Ojo de Agua and at Casabindo, and all the heads from
those two localities display deformation both as regards adults and
children. The only head, on the other hand, which I succeeded in dis-
covering in the Tarija Valley does not show any trace of having been
deformed. The specimens discovered at the last-mentioned locality
are, moreover, with few exceptions, of an entirely different type from
the Punaones. The few isolated articles that are similar to specimens
from Ojo de Agua and Casabindo, have, in all probability, come into
the hands of the inhabitants of the Tarija Valley through the channel
of trade with the people of the Puna. Further, at several dwelling
places in the Puna, among others at Cangrejillos, I discovered here
and there an isolated specimen of arrowheads analogous to those
which are characteristic, both in type and variety of flint, of the
Tarija Valley. As regards the age of the different dwelling places,
the finding of the iron knife and the cow horn at Casabindo proves,
of course, that the ancient culture, at any rate at that locality, con-
tinued on till the invasion of the Spaniards; but at all the other dwel-
ARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCHES IN ARGENTINA AND BOLIVIA. 581

ling places I investigated, both in the Puna and at Tolomosa, no
object was met with that could suggest foreign influence, and that,
although the number of specimens obtained from the last-named
locality was several thousands, it is still a tolerably risky proceed-
ing to endeavor to identify the former inhabitants of the dwelling
places with any still extant Indian tribe. More extensive research is
requisite before that can be attempted with any certainty of correct-
ness. Many circumstances point, nevertheless, to the Indians now
living in the Puna, though their numbers are exceedingly small, as
descendants of the tribes that were once so numerous and so powerful
in these regions. In spite of the great uncertainty still attaching to
this problem, I have, nevertheless, thought it desirable to touch upon
it here, in order to give rise possibly to a discussion upon it.

OBJECTS FOUND AT THE ANCIENT DWELLING PLACE NEAR TOLOMOSA, IN THE TARIWA
VALLEY. NATURAL SIZE.
A GENERAL VIEW OF THE ARCHEOLOGY OF THE
PUEBLO REGION.

By Enaar L. HEWEtT.

I. Limits or THE REGION.

The term “pueblo region” has not yet been acceptably defined.
As used in this paper it designates that portion of the United States
over which are distributed the archeological remains and the hving
remnants of those aboriginal North American tribes which from
their chief common characteristic, that of permanent substantial
house building, received from the Spanish conquerors the name of
Pueblo or town Indians. It embraces almost the whole of New
Mexico and Arizona, with small portions of southwestern Colorado
and southeastern Utah. There is probably no reason why the term
should not be extended to embrace large portions of the states of
Sonora and Chihuahua, in Old Mexico.

To determine the exact limits of the pueblo region is one of the
tasks of American archeology that awaits completion. Special ex-
ploration with a view to the determination of these limits has not
yet. been undertaken. However, the archeological remains are of so
conspicuous a character that the boundaries are approximately
revealed. I accept the Pecos valley, in eastern New Mexico, with its
tributary the Gallinas, as the eastern limit. Straggling ruins are
found farther east, in Scott County, Kans., and in the Canadian
valley, in Texas; but these are remains of temporary settlements.
There is no well-established evidence of serious attempts by the
aborigines to form permanent substantial settlements upon the
“oreat plains.” Those easterly remains of pueblo culture in the
Gallinas valley near where the city of Las Vegas now stands and
in the Pecos valley in the vicinity of the present Anton Chico were
also comparatively transitory. The northern limit is less definite,
but is approximately the northern rim of the San Juan Basin, in
Colorado and Utah. Such pueblo settlements as were formed north of
the San Juan-Grand divide—for example, those of the Lost Canyon

,

and others in the Dolores drainage—were of little importance. On
the west and northwest the limit is the northwestern outline of the
basin of the Rio Colorado. Pueblo settlements beyond this boundary
were few. On the east side of the river typical pueblo culture
flourished. Passing to the western side we find it gradually ceased
to be characteristically pueblo. On the south the boundary as
accepted in this paper is the southern rim of the Gila valley. This
limitation is purely arbitrary, however, as traces of identical or but
shghtly differing culture extend much farther south.

An examination of the physiography of the frontiers of this cul-
ture is instructive. East of the Pecos and of the Rocky mountains
are the vast unbroken grassy plains, the great cattle range of recent
years, and the favorite buffalo range of earlier times. The buffalo
afforded the principal food supply for the plains Indians. It was
an unstable source of subsistence. This, in primitive life, induces
a correspondingly mobile population, whereas a culture of the
Pueblo type is based on sedentary habits. Physiographic conditions
account for the arrest of Pueblo culture east of the Pecos. Its
failure to extend west of the Colorado is likewise a matter of physi-
ography, for along the lower course of this river absolute aridity
prevented settlement, while farther up the great chasm of the Grand
Canvon barred migration. The reason for the arrest of the Pueblo
frontier on the north with the San Juan-Grand watershed is not
so apparent. To the northeast was an excellent game country, full
of warlike hunting tribes, forming an effective barrier in that direc-
tion, but to the northwest through Utah and Nevada the physi-
ographic conditions were altogether favorable to the Pueblo culture,
and an open gateway in that direction is found east of the Colorado.
On the south the Gila does not constitute either a physiographic or
ethnographic boundary, since similar conditions extend down into
Mexico. By common usage the name “ Pueblo” is applied only to
tribes within the United States, disregarding the ethnic similarities
of north Mexican tribes. Here we find natural gateways for the
entrance of early immigrants into Pueblo territory from the Rio
Grande at the southeast and along the Gila and its tributaries from
the southwest. ;

There is thus inclosed within the boundaries above described a
physiographic area which is accurately characterized by the term
“semiarid,” the limits of which are approximately coextensive with
the limits of the Pueblo culture. The climatic conditions are pecul-
iarly definite. Dryness is the prevailing condition. Precipitation
is very unequally distributed throughout the year. Heavy rainfalls
of from a few hours to some days’ duration are followed by months
devoid of moisture. The character of the soil is such thatthe effects
of rainfall rapidly disappear. Absorption, evaporation, and drain-

age proceed with great rapidity. Between the Pecos and the Colo-
rado are extensive plateaus of inferior grass lands, timbered moun-
tain ranges, narrow arable valleys, and vast stretches of sandy
desert. Much of the area exceeds a mile above sea level. The
country was probably always deficient in game, neither were wild
fruits plentiful, nor was any indigenous food supply abundant.

These physiographic conditions exercised a coercive influence over
the primitive culture of the Southwest, making fixed abodes and an
agricultural basis of food supply necessary. To the east and north
nomadic hunting tribes followed where the food quest led them.
They shunned the southwestern desert for the same reason that the
buffalo did. Navahoes, Comanches, and Apaches did not invade
this region until comparatively recent years, for obvious reasons.
In the economic systems of primitive men we find the germs of up-
to-date commercialism. Wealth is obtained by producing it and by
dispossessing others of it. The tribes mentioned belonged to the
predatory class. As game was scarce in the Southwest, there was no
reason for their going there until it became worth while for predatory
reasons.

The true indigines of the Southwest were necessarily agricultur-
ists. Coming into a region where game and wild fruits afforded
insufficient subsistence, they, probably partly from previous experi-
ence and partly from immediate necessity, were constrained to sup-
plement their food supply by the cultivation of food plants. The
preparation of ground for agriculture and the necessary devices for
the utilization of water for irrigation induced a comparatively per-
manent abode and substantial house building. Settlements, with rare
exceptions, were perforce clustered in narrow valleys along water-
ways, or in cliffs, or on mesa tops, within reach of streams or peren-
nial springs.

Thus the indigines of the Southwest were and are Pueblos (town
builders) throngh the coercion of physiographic environment. As
an ethnic division they are a most indefinite one, embracing several
well-established linguistic stocks and numerous minor dialectic
groups, which become more numerous the farther back they are
traced. Every existing Pueblo tribe that has been studied has been
found to be composite, formed by combination of sundry ethnic
groups more or less amalgamated. Incoming bands, regardless of
blood or previous condition, if they came seeking permanent abode.
became Pueblos, whether they amalgamated closely by blood with
previous settlers or not, by virtue of their enforced adoption of the
mode of life made necessary by the physiographic conditions of the
region. Similarity of house life, of food, of method of acquiring the
same, of inventions necessary to food production, of utensils for con-
serving and transporting the secant and precious water supply, of

experience with the elements and soil, of suffering from far ine and
foes, in time led to a degree of like-mindedness which found corre-
sponding expression in religious belief, in esthetic feeling, in social
organization. The Pueblo tribes, while remaining unlike »s to lan-
guage and somatic characteristics, naturally became alike in general
and specific culture. Some of these elements of likeness may be
stated as follows: They were all producing rather than predatory
tribes; they preferred sedentary to nomadic life; they preferred
stable rather than transitory homes; they developed a societary sys-
tem founded on “mother right;” they evolved a highly complex
theogony, characterized by elaborate rain and growth ceremonials;
they developed highly the art of pottery with elaborate symbolic
ornamentation.

The name “ Pueblo” is thus almost without ethnological signifi-
cance, having no reference to tribal or linguistic relationship, but
relating mainly to a type of culture that developed in response to the
influence of a definite physiographic environment, the limits of which
were fixed by nature as above set forth.

II. Criasses or ARCHEOLOGICAL REMAINS.

A much greater variety of archeological remains exists in the
Southwest than in other parts of the United States, owing to the per-
manence of abodes, the adaptation of climate to the preservation of
artifacts usually perishable, and the comparatively uninhabited con-
dition. While in other parts of the country little save the contents
of graves, consisting of stone implements, pottery, and osseous re-
mains, now exist, and the majority of these lost or disturbed by the
progress of agriculture, here we find not only graves and all the usual
mortuary remains, but extensive remains of houses in every stage of
preservation, with all the appurtenances of domestic life preserved
therein, and numerous shrines, ceremonial deposits, and an extensive
paleography displaying the esthetic and religious life.

The ruins of domiciliary structures are capable of division, not on
structural differences, but by situation, into the two general classes—
pueblos and cliff dwellings. The first embraces all those multiple-
chambered structures, either single or in clusters, that are situated
on mesas or in valleys independent of support from natural rock walls.
The second includes those that are wholly or in part embraced within
cliffs, built against cliffs, or situated on ledges under overhanging
cliffs, either single or multiple chambered. The location of the vil-
lage of a pre-Columbian sedentary tribe was selected primarily with
reference to water and arable lands. This was modified in time by
the necessities of defense against incoming predatory enemies, which
multiplied as the Pueblos accumulated food supphes sufficient to
make them desirable prey. The kind of a house to be built was

determined by the geology of the location. If in the open, sandstone
or tufa blocks, bowlders, and adobe were used, as furnished by the
environment, and the structure timbered with what nature supplied.
If considerations of defense necessitated a cliff dwelling, its character
was a geological question. Great natural caves and recesses under
overhanging cliffs were selected, and houses not structurally differ-
ent from the pueblos in the open were built within them. Such for-
mations oecur numerously throughout the Rio Colorado drainage
area. Accordingly we find this class of chff dwellings distributed
over the valleys of the San Juan, Little Colorado, Gila, and their
tributaries.

In cliffs of volcanic tufa, or other material sufficiently friable to
permit of easy working with stone tools, dwellings were excavated.
Small natural caves in such regions were utilized as dwellings, with
or without further excavation, and both with and without masonry.
Large open caves were sometimes walled up. Interior walls were
sometimes built. Houses not structurally unlike pueblos in the open
were built in front of these excavated rooms against the cliffs. The
name “cavate dwelling ” (originally proposed by Professor Mason)
has long been applied to excavated cliff dwellings. They are distrib-
uted over the four drainage basins of the pueblo region, being most
numerous on the western tributaries of the Rio Grande, the northern
tributaries of the San Juan, and the northern tributaries of the Gila,
particularly the Rio Verde.

Til. Disrrisnution.

The distribution of the Pueblo culture, as disclosed by archeolog-
ical remains, was determined primarily by drainage. The region lies
on both sides of the Continental divide. The eastern portion is
drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries; the western by three
principal tributaries of the Rio Colorado, viz, the San Juan, the Lit-
tle Colorado, and the Gila. These four drainage basins constitute
the primary seats of Pueblo culture.

The primal needs of primitive man are water, food, and shelter.
In the Southwest, water was first in importance. Where water was,
food was possible. Such game as the country supported frequented
waterways and springs, and here only were to be found the conditions
necessary to the production of food plants. Accordingly, the exten-
sion of the indigenous culture was directed by the drainage, and so
thoroughly did it overspread the region under consideration that
there is not a-valley of any consequence from the Pecos to the Colo-
rado, and from the San Juan to the Gila, that is without its charac-
teristic archeological remains. Following is a list of the principal
valleys, basins, canyons, and mesas containing ruins:

TV. PRESERVATION.

Present state——The present state of preservation of the south-
western ruins depends upon several conditions. Cliff dwellings,
because of their sheltered situation, are much better preserved than
pueblos in the open. Of the former class those of the excavated type
are naturally the best preserved, since in many of them there are no
artificial walls at all and deterioration occurs only with the falling
away of the natural rock. This form of deterioration does occur to
a destructive extent in many places and manifestly is not preventable,
but even in the absence of all protective measures thousands of speci-
mens of this class of domiciles would remain in a state of perfect
preservation for ages. The pueblo-like cliff dwellings being situ-
ated under heavy overhanging ledges are well protected from the
elements and unmolested would endure for centuries. But their
destruction seems to have been made the peculiar pastime of a cer-
tain class of human beings. The early explorers of the Mancos
Canyon would now find, in many cases, unrecognizable heaps of stone
where thirty years ago were well-preserved structures. The excava-
tion of cliff dwellings without due regard to the preservation of walls
should be made a grave misdemeanor. The preservation of these
remains 1s now almost entirely a matter of protection from vandals,
since they are quite perfectly sheltered from the elements.

The ruins of pueblos are exposed not only to vandalism but also
to the constant destructive effects of the weather. In most cases the
buildings are almost totally destroyed, only small fragments of walls
remaining standing above the débris. Noted exceptions to this are
illustrated in accompanying plates. The height of walls bears little
relation to the age of ruins. The difference in the state of preser-
vation is due principally to the character of the material used in con-
struction and the degree of exposure to vandalism. In some cases
walls have been taken down by the settlers and the stones used in the
590 GENERAL VIEW OF ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PUEBLO REGION.

construction of buildings, corrals, ete. Much destruction was
wrought in earher times by the removal of the timbers for firewood by
settlers and passing campers, thus causing the collapse of all walls
above the first story. Ruins in the treeless desert have suffered
especially from this cause. The material used in building has much
to do with the state of preservation. Other things being equal, the
pueblos that were built of small bowlders and adobe were the first
to succumb to the elements and are most reduced, the convex surfaces
of the stones affording little stability to the walls as the plastering
and chinking material weathered out. The Rio Grande pueblos were
mostly of this class and are reduced to mounds. Somewhat more
durable were those built of tufa blocks as in the Pajarito Park oueb-
los. But here also the imperfectly flattened surfaces of the stones are
readily freed by the weather from the supporting mortar and chink-
ing stones, and collapse of the walls readily occurs. The best pre-
served of all are those built of laminated sandstone as in Chaco
Canyon. The flat slabs fit together perfectly with but little mortar
or chinking to weather out, so that the walls, even in the absence of
timbers, remain intact until thrown down by human agency.

Future preservation—The subject of preservation of American
antiquities is now receiving an amount of attention never heretofore
accorded it. For a quarter of a century certain thoughtful people
have been calling attention to the matter and the continuous publica-
tion of archeological and ethnological literature is bearing fruit.
Learned societies, scientific and educational institutions, legislative
bodies, and public-spirited individuals are beginning to devote to the
question consideration commensurate with its importance. The prob-
lem is an intricate one. A more general diffusion of information con-
cerning it is urgently needed.

Of the archeological remains in the Southwest, probably nine-
tenths are on lands yet owned or controlled by the Government of
the United States, mainly upon forest reserves, Indian reservations,
lands withdrawn from entry for special purposes, military reserva-
tions, and unappropriated public lands. So the question may still
be dealt with through the National Congress and [Executive Depart-
ments. In some cases it may become necessary to interest States and
Territories in preservative measures, and in others private owners,
railroad companies, and companies owning land grants will need to
be impressed with the importance of preserving these remains for
archeological research.

Preservation must be:

(1) Permanent in cases where the condition and historic or ethnic
significance of the ruins give them special educational value.

(2) Temporary in the case of all aboriginal buildings, graves, and
other archeological remains not included in the first class, the pro-

tection to be afforded until all data of importance to science have been
investigated and all artifacts in connection therewith removed to
inuseums for permanent preservation.

Preservation is to be secured :

(1) Through Congress: Under special legislation creating national
archeological reservations or parks and general legislation establish-
ing a system of custodianship and administration over all archeo-
logical remains on the lands owned or controlled by the Government
of the United States. Up to date but one measure looking toward the
preservation of antiquities has ever been passed by the National Con-
gress, and this provided for the preservation of a single building—
Casa Grande, in Arizona. As early as 1896 a general bill was pre-
pared and presented to the National Congress and similar measures
have been introduced since from time to time down to the 58th
Congress, but none have passed.

(2) Through Executive Departments: By the exercise of powers
inherent in such departments under the Constitution and General
Statutes. With the single exception above noted, all that has been
accomplished by way of protection of antiquities has been by this
method. It is exceedingly fortunate that, as will be seen further on,
so much can be provided for incidentally in connection with the ad-
ministration of our great economic, Indian, and military interests,
thus involving but little additional expense.

By virtue of section 441, United States Revised Statutes, the care
and custody of the public lands is vested in the Secretary of the
Interior, and section 453 declares that the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office shall perform, under the direction of the Secretary
of the Interior, all executive duties in any wise respecting such lands.
There can be no question that this statute places upon the Department
of the Interior and the General Land Office the obligation to protect
the archeological remains that are upon the public lands as definitely
as 1t does any other values thereon.

In the exercise of the power thus conferred a policy has developed
in the General Land Office and Office of Indian Affairs, under the
Department of the Interior, that is highly commendable as far as it
goes. This policy utilizes forest supervisors and rangers, special
agents, Indian school superintendents, Indian agents, additional
farmers, and police in the protection of ruins in connection with and
as one of their regular duties for the avowed purpose of preserving
them for scientific investigation. It establishes the liberal policy
that any competent scientist who desires to place the material se-
cured in a public museum will be authorized by the Department of
the Interior to examine ruins, but that no person will be permitted
to excavate them for the purpose of acquiring specimens for traftie
or private gain, and that willful destruction of historic and prehis-
592 GENERAL VIEW OF ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PUEBLO REGION.

toric landmarks must cease. Especially noteworthy is the emphasis
laid by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on “ the im-
portance of furthering in every way possible researches with a view
to increasing the knowledge of such objects and aiding the general
advancement of archeological science.” Every thinking man will
uphold this policy most cordially.

As above stated, practically all that has been accomplished thus
far has been through the exercise of powers inherent in the executive
branches of the Department of the Interior. This authority is read-
ily invoked, and in the past has responded with great promptness to
every reasonable recommendation. By this means the following pro-
tective measures have been secured:

1. Through the General Land Office:

(a) All ruins on forest reserves * have been placed under the care
of the regular forest rangers. This includes the vast number of
ruins on the Gila Forest Reserve, the Black Mesa Forest Reserve, the
San Francisco Mountains Forest Reserve, and a considerable num-
ber on the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve. ;

(b) The Pajarito Park, in New Mexico; the Mesa Verde Park, in
Colorado, districts containing vast numbers of prehistoric ruins, and
a tract on which stands El Morro or Inscription Rock, in New Mexico,
a most important historic landmark, have been withdrawn from dis-
posal under the public-land laws and recommended for permanent
preservation as national parks, as has also the petrified forest in Ari-
zona, withdrawn primarily for preservation as a natural wonder, but
also containing Important ruins.

(c) The proposed Jemez and Taos forest reserves, in New Mexico,
and the proposed Rio Verde Forest Reserve, in Arizona, have been
withdrawn from entry or disposal. This will incidentally preserve
a vast number of important ruins.

(d) The ruins situated on unappropriated public lands have been
held to be subject to the authority of the Department of the Interior
and orders have been issued through special agents prohibiting injury
and unauthorized excavation.

2. Through the Office of Indian Affairs:

(a) Special custodians have been appointed for ruins-in Canyons
del Muerto and de Chelly on the Navaho Reservation in Arizona;
for those on Mesa Verde on the southern Ute Reservation in Colo-
‘ado, and for those on the Zufi Reservation in New Mexico.

(b) The office prohibits all unauthorized persons from entering
Indian reservations and despoiling ruins or carrying away remains
of antiquity.

a Jurisdiction over forest reserves transferred to Bureau of Forestry, Depart-
ment of Agriculture, February 1, 1905.
GENERAL VIEW OF ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PUEBLO REGION. 598

(c) Order of February 11, 1905, prohibits licensed Indian traders
from dealing in prehistoric wares, thus removing from the Indians
and other persons the temptation to despoil the ancient cemeteries for
the sake of the small profits to be derived therefrom. This corrects
an abuse that has been very prevalent and disastrous.

Up to the present time there has been no coordination of the efforts
of the various departments of government along this line; no general
supervision is exercised ; no systematic reports on the condition of the
ruins are required; no system for regulating excavations and the
disposition of specimens exists. The matter should no longer be
dealt with sporadically. What is needed is a comprehensive system
of administration and regulation for the whole subject.

Measures for the preservation of antiquities can not be intelligently
framed without consideration of their situation with reference to
ownership or jurisdiction. In this respect all those of the Pueblo
region may be classified as in the following list. Below each class I
have indicated the executive officer having jurisdiction over the class
of lands named and necessarily of all antiquities thereon.

1. Those on national reservations or parks:
The Secretary of the Interior. “
2. Those on forest reserves :
The head of the Bureau of Forestry, under the Secretary of Agriculture.
3%. Those on Indian reservations :
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the Secretary of the Interior.
4. Those on military reservations :
The Secretary of War.
5. Those on unappropriated public lands :
The Commissioner of the General Land Office, under the Secretary of the
Interior.
6. Those on lands withdrawn from entry for special purposes :
The Commissioner of the General Land Office, under the Secretary of the
Interior,
Those on State lands.
Those on private lands (railroad lands, grants, homesteads, ete.).

In the appended list of important districts and sites the jurisdiction
if known is indicated.

The first class includes at present only Casa Grande in Arizona,
but important additions to this class are contemplated by certain
bills that have been before Congress for some years. The protection
of ruins in such reservations or parks is always adequately provided
for by special service.

The second class, those on forest reserves, includes, as will be seen
by reference to the list, a large proportion of the most important
ruins. By act of Congress of February 1, 1905, the administration
of forest reserves was transferred from the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, Department of the Interior, to the forester and

chief of the Bureau of. Forestry, Department of Agriculture. Forest
reserves are constantly patrolled by a force of forest rangers, and the
policy developed in the General Land Office of making it the duty of
these officials to protect ruins from despoliation is continued under
the Bureau of Forestry. This is all that could be desired. It may
be said that ruins of this class are the most fortunately situated of
all, for they are no longer liable to alienation by sale or entry of the
lands, and are adequately policed, with little or no expense for special
service. Large additions will be made to this class when the pro-
posed Jemez, Taos, and Rio Verde forest reserves are established.

The third class, those on Indian reservations, includes a large pro-
portion of the most important sites. The Office of Indian Affairs
fully recognizes the obligation to protect the ruins and prevent unau-
thorized excavation, and is, moreover, furnished with appropria-
tions and clothed with authority to utilize the same for the em-
ployment of such additional service as is necessary. Special cus-
todians are employed in districts of unusual importance, and this
service will doubtless be extended as need therefor is shown. It may
be said that all ruins that come under this class are in a position to be
adequately protected.

The fourth class, those on military reservations, are not numerous,
and the attention of the War Department has not of late been called
to the necessity of protecting them. Undoubtedly this Department
would take the necessary steps if advised of the desirability of the
same, and it doubtless has facilities for effective custodianship with-
out providing special service therefor.

The fifth class, those on public lands, are quite numerous, but not
nearly so numerous as has been supposed. The inadequacy of all
general archeological measures that have been proposed heretofore,
so far as I have been able to determine, hes fundamentally in the
fact that they have not taken cognizance of the legal definition of the
term “ public lands.” The courts have held the term “ public lands ”
to signify the Federal lands lying open on the market for preemp-
tion or homestead, and that when the Government has reserved cer-
tain holdings from preemption they ceased to be “ public lands.” 4
Thus limited, class five will probably not include over 15 per cent of
all the ruins on lands owned or controlled by the Government of the
United States, and on the list of important districts and sites it will
be seen that very few fall within this category. These lands, with
everything situated thereon, are constantly being alienated by pre-
emption, railroad selections, and lieu selections. Furthermore, with

the admission of New Mexico and Arizona as States, about 23,000,000
acres of public lands within their borders will pass to those Common-
wealths, and their legislatures will have to be invoked for the pro-
tection of ruins thereon. There are few, if any, remaining cases
where it is desirable that agricultural or otherwise useful lands
should be withheld from preemption or other disposal because of
the ruins situated upon them. Where such cases do exist, it would be
possible for the General Land Office, if informed by recognized
authority, to withhold by temporary withdrawal the smallest acre-
age adequate to the protection of the buildings, cemeteries, ete., until
excavated and reported on, after which the tracts should be released.
There are several important isolated sites and some inportant dis-
tricts situated on lands completely worthless for agricultural or other
economic purposes which should be withdrawn by the General Land
Office, since any preemption of them would be solely for the purpose
of securing possession of the antiquities thereon in violation of the
spirit of the land laws. Cases in point are the Chaco Canyon ruins,
in northwestern New Mexico, and those of Montezuma Mesa, south-
west of Acoma. The status of ruins on public lands, as that term
is here used, in not at all satisfactory. The General Land Office has
done what was possible by way of withdrawal and recommendation
for Congressional action in cases of exceptional importance in which
no economic interests were involved, and has prohibited unauthorized
excavation, but it has been ruled that under no existing provision of
law can funds be used to pay for custodianship. Accordingly the
protection afforded must of necessity be inadequate. A slight amend-
ment to the sundry civil bill would remedy this.

Those of the sixth class, situated on lands withdrawn from entry or
other disposal for special purposes, are very numerous, as may be seen
from the hst of important districts and sites. It is to be hoped that
all in this class may be speedily transferred to classes 1 and 2, as
contemplated by their withdrawal. With the establishment of
Pajarito National Park and the Jemez and Taos forest reserves the
efficient and permanent protection of a large proportion of the most
important of the ruins of the Rio Grande drainage will be assured.
The creation of the Mesa Verde National Park and saving, by with-
drawal, of as many of the Chaco Canyon pueblos as are on lands still
open to preemption, would insure the preservation of a fair propor-
tion of the important sites of the San Juan drainage. With the
establishment of the Rio Verde forest reserve all the great groups of
the Gila drainage will have been brought incidentally under ade-
quate permanent custodianship. ‘The status of ruins of the sixth
class is more satisfactory than those of the fifth. They are preserved
from alienation by preemption or other disposal and warning notices

are kept posted thereon, prohibiting injury and unauthorized exca-
vations, but these lands are not policed for the same reason that
those of class 5 are not. However, the orders of the Department
of the Interior have been effective to a great extent and ruins on
withdrawn lands are sutfering but little from vandalism.

The seventh class, those situated on State lands, is inconsiderable
at present, but with the admission of the Territories and subsequent
segregation of their lands this class will require consideration. As
segregation will not, as a rule, be in large areas, but by single sec-
tions, large districts of ruins will not be affected, but important
isolated sites will be, and the State governments should then be
invoked to exercise protective authority over them.

The eighth class, those on private lands, includes many important
sites. The number of private land grants. in New Mexico espe-
cially, is very large, and some of them are covered with important
ruins. Many are on railroad selections and some on small holdings
or homesteads. Some owners of homesteads and grants realize the
importance of preserving these ruins for scientific research and
exercise due custodianship over them. Others use the stones for
building material, and timbers, if any, for firewood.

The above is as comprehensive a presentation of the status of
archeology in the pueblo region as I am capable of making within
the limits set for this paper. It is based on many years of personal
residence and field work in. the Southwest, in connection with the
researches of all other investigators of the pueblo field, the results
of which I have freely availed myself of. During the past six
months I have had the opportunity to give considerable attention to
the phases of the subject dealt with in this paper, for which the
resources of the General Land Office, the Office of Indian A ffairs,
the Bureau of Forestry, and the Bureau of Amercian Ethnology
have been most cordially placed at my disposal. I feel that my con-
clusions are at least not hastily drawn.

V. Synopsis oF Imporrantr Districts AND SITES.

In this arrangement I have endeavored to point out only those
archeological districts and special sites which, by reason of their
character. situation, state of preservation, or ethnic significance, are
particularly worthy of investigation. The list is by no means a
complete one. Doubtless many are omitted that are as important
as those named, and it is to be remembered that every aboriginal site
or object is of sufficient importance to warrant investigation.

In order to indicate, when known, how the various sites are located
with reference to jurisdiction, I have used the following abbrevia-

The majority of the above (1 to 9) are sites occupied within the last
four centuries and abandoned at intervals from the time immediately
preceding the Spanish occupation down to 1838. The years imme-
diately following 1680 were particularly disastrous to the Rio Grande
Pueblos. Archeological research at these sites should be fruitful in
throwing light upon the first influences of the exotic civilization upon
the indigenous tribes. They are all ruins of considerable magnitude,
but in many cases reduced to mounds.

This is strictly a prehistoric district and archeologically one of the
richest in the Pueblo region. The cliff dwellings are of the excavated
type and exist in vast numbers, almost every southern escarpment
being honeycombed with them. Besides the identified pueblo ruins
named, several others of almost equal importance and hundreds of
minor ones are scattered over the district. The permanent reserva-
tion of this tract will preserve intact a fairly complete exhibit of
the prehistoric civilization of the Rio Grande Valley. This is now
assured, for it falls within the limits of the proposed Rio Jemez
Forest Reserve, and will in due time come under the custodianship
of the Bureau of Forestry if it does not become a national park. The
only collections that have been made from this district are in the
museum of the New Mexico Normal University at Las Vegas.

extensive, and received its name from what was the central geographical feature
of the entire district, viz, Pajarito Canyon. This has since been found to be
largely on Ramon Vigil Grant, which was almost surrounded by the proposed
park. As the lines are now drawn, it creates Pajarito Park with the “ Pajarito n

af apply this name to the district north of Cochiti, which embraces the ruins
of the former habitations of the Cochiti Indians. It was included in the

entire tract. This is no longer possible, since every alternate section
is now patented railroad land. The central group of ruins, 1. e.,
Pueblo Bonito and its environs, have passed to private ownership
unless annulled by the General Land Office. This tract of country
is absolutely worthless for any economic purpose. The fate of the
great body of ruins situated here is a striking illustration of the
need for comprehensive legislation on this subject. This loss to
science and history is solely the result of there being no one whose
business it is to look after such matters. Through the generosity of
the Messrs. Hyde, of New York City, a splendid collection obtained by
the partial excavation of Pueblo Bonito is preserved in the American

These are historically the most important ruins in the United

and many other pueblo sites of equal magnitude. Many are in a fair
state of preservation, some reduced to mounds; but it will be generally
agreed, I believe, that all remains of this historic group, whatever
may be their condition, merit preservation. Being under custodian-
ship, they should suffer but little from vandalism. Large collections
from these ruins are in the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, the results
of excavations by the Hemenway expedition.

VI. Concussion.

It is manifestly time for decisive action on the question of Ameri-
‘an antiquities. Congress should at once enact comprehensive leg-
islation on this subject. It is the duty of those interested in Ameri-
can archeology to prepare the necessary information and present it
to the proper authorities in such manner that the scope of legislation
needed will be self-evident. I offer the following suggestions, which
I beheve, in the hght of our present information, to be in accord with
the views of a large majority of the archeologists dealing with
American subjects and acquainted with the American field:

1. That the preservation of antiquities on all lands owned or con-
trolled by the Government of the United States should be provided
for by law.

2. That custodianship of antiquities should be left where it is, viz,
in the departments having jurisdiction over the lands on which an-
tiquities are situated, and that the protection of said antiquities by
said departments should be made obligatory.

3. Expert authority should exist for the periodical inspection of
ruins, report on the same, and recommendation of preservative meas-
ures to the departments having custodianship.

4. The privilege of excavation should be restricted to institutions,
domestic or foreign, that can conduct the same in a scientific manner
and make report of results, and that will place all collections secured
in permanent public museums.

5. There should be expert inspection of excavations, to see that the
GENERAL VIEW OF ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PUEBLO REGION. 605

came are conducted according to the regulations prescribed, and to
see that collections are disposed of as provided for by law and not
for commercial purposes.

6. Adequate penalties for violation of the law should be prescribed

In the meantime it is unnecessary to await the movement of the
great machinery of Congress when so much power already exists in
Executive Departments and so much loss goes on that future Con-
gressional action can never repair. Results can be steadily accom-
plished. Departments invite authentic information and recommen-
dations. When furnished with evidence they act promptly and
effectively. All who are interested in the preservation of American
antiquities—and this is a rapidly growing number—should encour-
age and uphold these efforts in every possible way.

MODERN FEMALE SKULL (GERMAN AUSTRIAN) FROM THE TYRO-
LEAN ALPS, WITH PAINTED INSCRIPTION AND DECORATION,

MALE SKULL, WITH BLACK DESIGNS ON THE FACE, FROM SANTA
CRUZ ICI AND CALIFORNIA.
THE PAINTING OF HUMAN BONES AMONG THE
INDIANS.¢

By ALES HrpiicKa.

Painting of human bones is one of the ethnic phenomena of a
relatively high differentiation found unaccountably in various, widely
separated parts of the world; and the custom has probably existed
in prehistoric as well as historic times. Painted skulls or bones
have been found in the York Islands (Finsch), in Polynesia, and
among the Papuans, in Austraha (W. Krause), New Zealand (Thi-
lenius, Martin), and Andaman Islands. A skull of a child (No.
164763, U. S. National Museum) from the Andaman Islands shows
on the vault, bilaterally, a geometrical design, including a line
of connected diamond-shaped figures, in red paint; and on the vault
of an adult female skull (No. 164765, U. S. National Museum),
from the same locality, are four lines, running from before backward,
of similar but smaller diamond-shaped figures painted in white.
Bones covered more or less by red pigment—in many instances it
has not been definitely settled whether intentionally or accidentally—
are very common in the older kourgans over large regions in Cau-
casus and southern Russia (Vasselovski, Antonoviteh, Zaborovski,
Spizyn, and others), in Moravia (Makovsky), Bohemia (Matiegka),
Switzerland (Martin), Italy (Pigorini), France (d’Acy, Piette,
etc.), and Germany (Krause). A curious habit of placing inscrip-
tions of name, date of birth and date of death of the person upon the
skull, and surrounding this with a hand-painted design, has existed
until recent years in the Tyrolean Alps. The U. S. National Mu-
seum possesses three examples of such skulls (from Professor Koll-
man, in Basel), one of which is here illustrated (fig. 1, pl. 1), and I
have seen a number of others in Professor Zuckerkandl’s collection in
Vienna.

On the American continent bone painting has been reported by
some of the old chroniclers, as well as some modern students. I

a Modified, with some additions, from the author’s A Painted Skeleton from
Northern Mexico, with Notes on Bone Painting among the American Aborigi-
nes, printed in American Anthropologist, n. s., vol. 3, Sept.—Dec., 1901, pp.
701-725.

605 THE PAINTING OF HUMAN BONES AMONG THE INDIANS.

shall mention both later on. It existed, in more or less separated
localities, in South America, as well as in North America and in
Mexico.

The subject has been repeatedly brought to my attention in exam-
ining Indian bones in our various museums, and is so closely and in
several ways associated with various modes of accidental bone
staining that the two must, to a certain extent, be treated together.

All pigmentation of human bones, including painting, is divisible
into five varieties.

The first variety, which is quite common, includes the skeletons
that have been more or less stained or infiltrated accidentally by the
coloring matter of the earth in which they have lain. As pronounced
examples of this variety of staining I may mention the bones of a part
of Mr. Bandelier’s collection from Bolivia (A. M. N. H.), which are
thoroughly stained and infiltrated by red clay. The accidental stain-
ing is mostly reddish or yellowish, but it may be dark, as was observed
by Professor Putnam in certain burial places in Tennessee, and as
can also be seen in a number of Florida skulls in the American Mu-
seum, and in the Costa Rica crania recovered from a deposit of vol-
canic ashes, now in the Carnegie Museum. Usually in these cases all
the bones of the body are colored, and with little difference in inten-
sity. The cavities of the skull show the same or nearly the same
coloring as the parts more exposed.

The second variety of stained bones consists generally of skulls
which had been stained green by salts of copper. ‘These salts resulted
mostly from the decomposition of copper (or copper alloy) ornaments
or implements buried with the bodies. The staining in these cases,
as a rule, is but partial; the coloring is greenish and is deepest at the
nearest points of contact with the decomposed articles. The copper
salts discolor the skull even through the skin. There is in the
National Museum a comparatively fresh female skull from Oregon
(No. 150011). in which the borders of both orbits and some of the
neighboring parts, though still covered by their skin, are green, On
the closed eyelids of each eye are seen two circular impressions, appar-
ently made by some coins pressed into that position; the copper salts
resulting from the decomposition of these coins penetrated through
the opening of the eyelids as well as through the skin and discolored
the bone beneath. There is another specimen of allied nature in the
collection from Utah. Green-stained skulls have been found in
numerous localities on both parts of the continent, especially along
the northwest coast. The Wasco skull here pictured shows a char-
acteristic coloration of this nature (fig. 1, pl. 11).

In the third and very frequent and widely distributed variety of
stained bones, there is more or less staining of the skeleton by pig-
ments which were buried with the body. In most cases known to me,
THE PAINTING OF HUMAN BONES AMONG THE INDIANS. 609

or of which T have found mention in literature, the coloration was
red, and in most instances-due to red ocher. In a few cases, probably
more recent burials, the pigment was vermilion.

The fourth class of stained bones is much more restricted than
any of the preceding; it consists mainly of skulls which had been
painted by hand. In all but two cases known to me on this con-
tinent the paint was red, and was applied sometimes over the facial
parts of the skull only, at other times over the whole cranium, and
in a few instances also over other bones of the skeleton. I shall
cite examples of this class from United States, Canada, and other
regions.

The fifth and final variety of bone staining consists of skulls on
which designs have been made in colors. Such specimens thus far
found are few and they are probably all, or nearly all, recent.

A variety of red pigmentation of human bones by the products of
pigment producing bacteria has been suggested by Krause; I have
as yet come across no instance where such agency would appear prob-
able. Blackening of bones is occasionally witnessed in maceration.

In a number of instances it is difficult, if not impossible, to decide
whether the given bones have been stained accidentally by the pig-
ment buried with the body, or whether they have been intentionally
painted. It may be assumed, however, as a general rule, that where
the coloration is symmetric, rather uniform in extent, and restricted
to the external surface, not extending into the fossw, ventral cavity,
or even the alvoelar spaces of a skull, we have to deal with inten-
tional painting of the specimen. In accidental staining the pigment
is often found mixed with the earth about the bones, it covers the
bones less regularly, and penetrates more or less into all the larger
spaces. It is, of course, also possible that the paint applied to the
bones by hand after their burial spreads somewhat by natural means
to other parts, as well as to the soil, but in such instances the second-
ary coloration of the bone is hable to be restricted besides irregular,
and the staining of the soil is very limited.

It is principally the last three varieties of pigmented bones which
ure, 1n this country each in a distinctive way, of ethnological-interest,
for they represent so many different, though probably related, cus-
toms of the American aborigines.

The geographical distribution of such stained or painted bones on
this continent appears to be very wide, but so far is quite irregular.
With the increase of material, some of the existing lacune will
undoubtedly be filled, while in other cases there will be traced, accord-
ing to indications, allied customs. On the whole it seems that one or
another use of red pigment, particularly ocher, has been quite general
in the funerary rites of the American Indians.

sM 1904——39
610 THE PAINTING OF HUMAN BONES AMONG THE INDIANS.

The deposit of pigments, particularly of ocher, in the shape of
paint, with the bodies of warriors, and especially of chiefs, was
very prevalent. Red paint was one of the Indian’s necessities, and,
with some of his other possessions, was buried with him as a part
of his equipment for the future world or his journey thither.
Lafitau (vol. mu, 8, p. 413), in referring to the articles generally
interred with the body of an Indian, mentions, among other things,
“a quantity of oil and some color with which to paint himself.”
Loskiel (vol. 1, p. 120) tells us that the Indians formerly “ used
to put a tobacco pouch, knife, tinder box, tobacco and pipe, bow and
arrows (or a gun, powder, and shot), skins and cloth for clothes,
paint, a small bag of Indian corn or dried bilberries, sometimes the
kettle, hatchet, and other furniture of the deceased into the grave,
supposing that the departed spirits would have the same wants and
occupations in the land of souls as they had in this world. But this
custom,” Loskiel says, “is now (in 1794) almost entirely abolished in
the country of the Delawares and Iroquois.”

Among the Hurons, according to Sagard (Histoire du Canada,
Paris, 1636, vol. m1, p. 647), some paint was buried with the women,
in order that in the other world they had enough to paint their robes
with. Quantities of red ocher have been found in ancient Maine
graves by Mr. C. C. Willoughby, of the Peabody Museum. Rev. J.
M. Spainhour, in 1871, found in a mound on St. Johns River, North
Carolina, three skeletons, and with each a quantity of red pigment
(Yarrow, p. 27.) According to Elliott (vol. 1, 60) and Young (p.
142), “ the first Europeans who came to Cape Cod found there in an
Indian grave nice matting, a bow, a decorated and painted board, and
two bundles of red powder, in which lay the bones of the buried.”

Mr. Moorehead found red ocher, and in a few instances also yellow
and white mineral paints, heaped, as he expresses it, on or near the
hands or other parts of the body, in earth mounds in several parts
of Ohio. Lewis and Clark (vol. 1, p. 239) mention having found
some red and blue paint with the cadaver of an Assiniboin female.
Mr. H. I. Smith, of the American Museum of Natural History,
unearthed a skeleton at Saginaw, Mich., which was covered with red
pigment, the surrounding soil being of a totally different character.
Dr. J. Walter Fewkes found vessels containing ‘* yellow ocher, ses-
auioxide of iron, green copper carbonate, and micaceous hematite ”
in what was apparently the burial of a priest, at Awatobi, a ruin of
a former pueblo the base of what was formerly the first mesa of the
Hopi Indians, in northern Arizona, and he found similar pigments
in graves at Sikyatki, another ruin in the same region; and examples
of a similar nature could be multiplied.

Judging from the references to Indian mortuary customs made by
various authors, there were apparently a large number of instances
THE PAINTING OF HUMAN BONES AMONG THE INDIANS. 611

in which, in addition to, or possibly without, the deposit of some pig-
ment with the deceased; the body, or at least the face, was painted.
If the pigment used was mineral in character, as was almost invari-
ably the case, the probability of the bones becoming more or less
stained by it after the flesh had decayed was very strong. The custom
of painting the body is especially well deseribed by Lafitau. Speak-
ing of the Indians of New France, he says that among them every
“cabane” had special individuals who took care of the deceased.
Those who are thus employed “ wash the body, oil it, and paint its
face and head. * * * Sometimes the man while yet living an-
nounces his death, arranges a feast, and lets himself be washed, oiled,
and painted, and bundled up still alive into the position which he is
to have in the grave.”

Loskiel gives similar information about the Indians of the Eastern
States and Canada: “ Immediately after the death the corpse is
dressed in a new suit, with the face and shirt painted red, and laid
upon a mat or skin in the middle of the hut or cottage.” Charlevoix
(vol. vr, p. 107) says that among the Canadian Indians “the dead
man is painted, enveloped in his best robe, and, with his weapon be-
side him, is exposed at the door of his cabin in the posture which he
is to preserve in the grave.” Sagard (vol. 1, p. 649), speaking also
of more than one northeastern tribe and without mentioning any
separately, says that “ not only are the savages in the habit of paint-
ing their faces black when any of their relatives dies, but they paint
also the face of the cadaver.”

The Iroquois, according to La Potherie (vol. m1, p. 9 et seq.),
“visit from time to time the burial place, paint the half-rotten bodies,
change their clothing, and rearrange them in the fossa.” Morgan
also mentions the face painting of the dead Troquois.

All the nations of the upper Missouri, according to Perrin du Lac,
painted the bodies of their dead warriors with red ocher. These
tribes comprised the Ricaras, Mandans, Grosventres, Chugayennes,
Sioux, Cayoroas, Tocaninambiches, Tokionakos, Pitapahatos, Pa-
daws, Halisanes, Assiniboins, and Crows. The custom was witnessed
among the Crows as late as 1870 by Col. P. W. Norris, superintendent
of the Yellowstone Park (cited by Yarrow), and quite as late among
the Dakotas by Surg. L. S. Turner, U. S. Army (also cited by Yar-
row). “The work among the Dakotas,” says Doctor Turner, * be-
gins as soon as life is extinct. ‘The face, neck, and hands are thick
painted with vermilion or a species of red earth found in various
portions of the Territory.”

The Creeks practiced a similar custom,’ and there are indications
of the former existence of a similar habit among the Omahas.

Professor Boas and Mr. Swanton inform me that many of the

612 THE PAINTING OF HUMAN BONES AMONG THE INDIANS.

tribes of the North and Northwest paint the faces of their dead. The
use of other colors than red were observed, but the latter predomi-
nates. ;

As to the Southwest and Mexico information on this subject is
very meager, but evidence points to similar practices.

Bone painting proper is comparatively rare, or at least much less
common than the custom of paint interment and of the painting of
various parts of the corpse. We meet with instances of bone paint-
ing proper in Ohio, Florida, and South Carolina, in the East; in
California, and possibly in British Columbia, in the West and North-
west; and in Mexico, and a few parts of Central and South America.

In Ohio painted bones were found by Prof. F. W. Putnam (Tur-
ner group mounds) and by Mr. W. K. Moorehead. The latter
writes 7 me on the subject as follows:

Painted bones have been found in a mound at Omega, Ross County, Ohio; in
Jackson County mound, Ohio, and in two mounds within the corporate limits
of Chillicothe. One of the latter was discovered by Mr. Clarence Loveberry,
assistant curator of the above [Ohio Archeological and Historical] society.
The others were found by myself. Near Green Camp, Marion County, Ohio, in
a stone grave 6 feet below the surface, Mr. Loveberry discovered a skeleton
entirely painted.

All of these were coated with red pigment or ocher, including in nearly every
ease all of the larger bones. There are other instances in which just the hands,
or the feet, or perhaps the skull were coated. These are usually from mounds,
either large or small. Bones on which the pigment was simply heaped were
clearly distinguished by the surrounding soil being also stained.

I have never observed instances in which skeletons were coated with yellow
or black paints. (We have found yellow and white mineral paints near the
hands of skeletons several times. )

We have never found painted bones in stone mounds. They are invariably
in earth mounds or stone graves. ,

In South Carolina the custom is thus described by Lawson (pp.
O22.)

As soon as the party is dead they lay the corpse upon a piece of bark in the
sun, seasoning or embalming it with a small root beaten to powder, which looks
as red as vermilion; ® the same is mixed with bear’s oil to beautify the hair and
preserve their heads from being lousy, it growing plentifully in these parts of
America. After the carcass has laid a day or two in the sun they remove and
lay it upon crotches cut on purpose for the support thereof from the earth ;
then they anoint it all over with the forementioned ingredients of the powder
of this root and bear’s oil. When it is so done they cover it very exactly over
with bark of the pine or cypress tree, to prevent any rain to fall upon it, sweep-
ing the ground very clean all about it.

As soon as the flesh grows mellow and will cleave from the bone they get it
off and burn it, making all the bones very clean; then anoint them with the
ingredients aforesaid, wrapping up the skull (very carefully) in a cloth artifi-
cially woven with possum’s hair. * * * The bones they carefully preserve

mn a wooden box, every year oiling and cleansing them; by these means _ pre-
serve them for many ages, so that you may see an Indian in possession of the
yones of his grandfather, or some of his relations of a longer antiquity.

In Florida bone painting seems to have been practiced extensively
und from an early period. The custom is mentioned in this part of
he country by Garcilasso de la Vega and by Herrera. Romans (p.
38) deseribes it among the Choctaw as follows:

The day [of the burial] being come, the friends and relations assemble near
he stage, a fire is made, and the respectable operator, after the body is taken
lown [from the stage on which it has lain for two to four months], with his
iuils tears the remaining flesh off the bones and throws it with the entrails
nto the fire, where it is consumed; then he scrapes the bones and burns the
scrapings likewise. The head being painted red with vermilion, is, with the
est of the bones, put into a neatly made chest (which for a chief is also mude
ed) and deposited in the loft of a hut built for that purpose, and called “ bone
iouse.”” Each town has one of these. After remaining here one year, or there-
ibouts, if he be a man of any note, they take the chest down, and in an assembly
f relations and friends they weep once more over him, refresh the color of the
read, paint the box, and then deposit him to lasting oblivion.

An enemy and one who commits suicide is buried under the earth, as one to
ve directly forgotten and unworthy of the above ceremonial obsequies and
nourning.

The late Andrew E. Douglass found what was possibly inten-
jonally painted bones near St. Augustine, Fla.

In certam parts of California the custom of bone painting seems
o have been common.

Dr. H. IF. ten Kate discovered several painted skeletons in Lower
Salifornia (a cave on Espiritu Santo Island) and M. Diguet found
thers in the valley of Las Calaveritas. All the specimens from
his part of the country were painted red. Those discovered by
en Kate were colored with ocher, while Diguet’s specimens were
lecorated with a paint obtained from volcanic ashes. M. Diguet
(p. 48) thought the localization of the burials in which painted
ones are found was restricted to “the islands of Espiritu Santo
ind Cerralbo and a number of localities on the peninsula reaching
na straight line from the Gulf of California to the Pacific Ocean.”
The collections in the National Museum- include one male adult
‘keleton (No. 148213, collected by EK. Palmer), from the Espiritu
Santo Island, Lower California, parts of which, especially the
femora, Show what appears to be intentional red painting. It 1s
srobable that from parts of this skeleton the paint, which looks
ike ocher, has been washed off. There is another male adult skele-
‘on (No. 61398, collected by L. Belding). and a separate lower jaw,

@Sanchez Mound, situated about 8 miles north of St. Augustine. Over 20
vodies found. “ Each cluster of bones was surmounted by the skull, and the
whole mass encrusted with red paint, which discolored the sand an inch around
them.” (Proceedings Am. Assoc. Ady. Sci., 1882, XX XI, p. 587.)
614 THE PAINTING OF HUMAN BONES AMONG THE INDIANS.

from near La Paz, Lower California, every part of which shows
intentional red painting, probably in ocher. The skull is here repro-
duced as a type of specimens of this nature (pl. mm.) In a few
patches on different parts of the skeleton the paint is nearly rubbed
er washed off.

Professor Boas informs me that some red skeletons have been
excavated near Thompson River in British Columbia, but it is not
certain whether these bones were accidentally stained or intentionally
painted. In the collection of the American Museum of Natural
Ilistory is a skull (No. 99-1604) of a Clayoquot warrior from the
west coast of Vancouver Island that is painted outwardly a very
dark brown. There are other skulls from the Northwest in the
collection of the American Museum that show red stains (particularly
No. 99-3047, Copalis, west coast of Washington; Smith), but in these
intentional painting is doubtful.

In Mexico I have never found any color stain on the bones in the
territory of the Tarahumares; but a skeleton painted red with some
vegetable dye and with traces of yellow, described by me before, was
obtained by C. Lumholtz just south of this region.

Several of the Tarasco crania from Michoacan (No. 99-175, for
example) in the American Museum collection show red stains, but
these may be accidental.

Finally, the American Museum collection includes several skulls
and some bones of ancient Zapotecs and Mixtecs, collected by Mr.
Saville in Oaxaca, and some of these show plain and indubitable
signs of intentional painting with some inorganic red pigment,
apparently ocher.

As to Central America and South America, one of the few refer-
ences to the custom which I have noted concerns the Caribs, who
according to Gumilla (Brinton’s Myths of the New World, p. 225),
about a year after death cleaned the bones of their dead, bleached
them, painted them, and wrapped them in odorous balsams; they
were then placed in a wicker basket which was kept suspended from
the door of the dwelling. ‘“ When the quantity of these heirlooms
became burdensome they were removed to some inaccessible cavern
and stored away with reverential care.”

The second instance pertains to the Bororos, one of the Amazon
tribes, who, according to Ehrenreich, unearth the body about two
weeks after death, clean the bones, paint them red, and additionally
decorate the skull with red feathers. Von den Steinen, who wit-
nessed the procedure among the Brazilian Indians with Ehrenreich,
deseribes it thus:” * The observance lasts a whole day. The remains

are unearthed eight to fourteen days after burial. The bones are
thoroughly cleaned.’ . ‘They were brought and all parts of the
skeleton were, before our eyes, painted red. They began with the
skull. The whole was apparently a mode of decoration.” * The
painted skull was additionally pasted over with red feathers. All
the bones, skull imeluded, were placed in a basket, which served
for the final interment and which also received a coat of red, being
in addition well covered with red feathers. The red pigment was
a vegetable substance obtained from a certain seed.”

IT have thus far found no historical evidence of bone painting
in Peru. There is no example of it among the over 200 Peruvian
skulls in the National Museum. Among more than 500 ancient
Peruvian crania of the Bandelher collection in the American Museum
there is but one that shows distinct red stains, but these seem to be
more accidental than otherwise. But in the more recent Gaffron
collection in that museum there is a male adult skull, from the neigh-
borhood of Cuzco (No. 99-3682), which shows over large portions of
its surface a firm pink incrustation, in all probability the remnant of
intentionally apphed paint. According to E. Krause there is in the
Reifs-Sttibel collection of crania from Ancon, Peru, one of which the
face is covered with * zinnober.” “

The painting of designs on human skulls on this continent requires
but few words. I have seen only five specimens of this sort and
found no mention of others. Four of the crania, one from Cali-
forma, two Wasco from the Columbia River, and one from the Santa
Cruz Island, California, are in the National Museum, and one found
by Mr. H. I. Smith at Lytton, British Columbia, is in the American
Museum of Natural History. The design on all but the Santa Cruz
Island specimen consists of red, or in one of the Wasco skulls red
and blue, cross made in very much the same manner (see fig. 2,
pli). It is in all probability a recent work of some of the Chris-
tianized Indians. ‘The Santa Cruz Island skull shows a_ partly
faded, apparently ancient design, in black, above and under the orbits
and on the maxille (see fig. 2, pl. 1).. A human skull, the vault
of which has been cut off, while the remainder was painted with
brown streaks and fitted into a stringed musical instrument, is pre-
served in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and was
supposed to be of south American origin, but it came in all proba-
bility from Africa.

TIE SIGNIFICANCE OF BONE PAINTING AMONG INDIANS.
sone painting among the American aborigines is most probably
a development of the custom of painting the corpse, just as the
latter is an extension of the custom of painting the living. Paint.

616 THE PAINTING OF HUMAN BONES AMONG THE INDIANS.

particularly red paint, was, and to some extent still is, among
many American Indians, a part of the warrior’s preparation for
battle, and it was a mark of fitness, elevation, bravery, honor; and
some of the tribes honored their distinguished dead, or even all
their dead, with the same paint, applied in more or less the same
manner in which it was used by the living. The bones of at least
the naturally deceased friends were generally regarded with rev-
erence.

According to Brinton (op. cit., p. 257) the opinion underlying
all customs connected with the preservation of bones among various
American people was “that a part of the soul, or one of the souls,
dwelt in the bones; that these were the seeds which, planted in the
arth, or preserved unbroken in safe places would in time put on
once again a garb of flesh and germinate into living human beings.
Language in some localities seems to strengthen this theory. The
Iroquois word for bone is ‘ eshen, for soul, ‘ atishen, literally that
which is within the bone. (Bruyas, Rad. Verborum Troqueeorum. )
TM an Athapascan dialect bone is ‘ yami,y soul, ‘i-yune. (Busch-
mann, Athap, Sprachstamm, pp. 182, 188.)

Yet there may have been instances in which the flesh or the bones
of the dead were partly or wholly painted for other reasons. It is
probable that in some instances the paint was considered a necessary

ss

or advantageous or proper equipment for the journey to the future
world. Lafitau (vol. 1, 8, p. 388) says that the Indians “ apphed
the paint to the head and face in order that the horrors of death
should not be seem.” According to Boas, among the Chinook, who
bury their dead mostly in canoes raised above the ground, after a
time “the burial place is made good with red paint,” which implies
that in this tribe such paint is connected with some superstition.
Finally, according to Bandelier, among the Muysca in Bogota, New
Granada, bodies painted with red ocher were a sign of deep mourn-
ing. Judging from the general want among Indians of rational
notions regarding the natural processes in the living or dead, it seems
very improbable (though I formerly was inclined to think otherwise)
that the paint was in any instance applied simply as a preservative.

SLING CONTRIVANCES FOR PROJECTILE WEAPONS.

By F. KRAvSE,

Leipzig.

There is already a rich, though scattered, literature on the subject
of shng contrivances for missile weapons, but it is made up mostly of
travelers’ notes, mentioning these contrivances in certain localities,
although there are also some comprehensive works treating them
according to type and distribution. A general treatise, however, 1s
still needed from which may be obtained a view of their distribution
and varieties throughout the world.

The missiles are projectiles driven by the lever power of the arm
in contradistinetion to those like the ax, hammer, sword, knife, and
lance, which depend upon the thrusting power of the arm and, with
few exceptions, are intended merely for operation in the immediate
vicinity. The most primitive projectiles were the stones and clubs
and from the beginning the purpose has been to improve these missiles
by giving them greater power of flight and surety of aim. This
has been attained by lengthening the arm artificially and strengthen-
ing the lever power, from which great distance resulted. This was
attained for the stone by means of the sling, and the club was made
more efficacious by changing the form, as with the throwing clubs
of the South Africans, the Fijians, and others; in the sickle-shaped
missiles, so that they became formidable as a projectile; in the boom-
erangs of the Australians, or in the sharpened, thinner shafts for
arrow or spear. The arrow, in its turn, could be sent afar through
the principle of elasticity in the bow, an instrument encountered in
all parts of the world, and which has further developed into arbalests
and to firearms. Sling contrivances for the spear are found in.cer-
tain parts of the world depending upon either the lengthening of
the arm, upon lever power, or that which serves to give the spear a
revolution upon its axis. These contrivances were formerly quite
widely dispersed, but are now to be found only in certain widely sepa-
rated localities. They are divided into two classes: (1) Spear slings,

usually called “* throwing sticks,” a misleading term, since it conveys 4
false meaning, as though these shafts were themselves thrown, while
they merely serve as a help in throwing; and (2) throwing nooses
and throwing thongs.

The spear sling is spread over four distinct areas: (1) Australia
and, partially, Melanesia and Micronesia; (2) among certain north-
eastern Asiatics, as well as among the American and Greenland Eski-
mos; (3) Central America and equatorial South America, and (4)
France during the reindeer epoch.

The throwing noose is found in (1) New Caledonia, New Hebrides,
and New Zealand; (2) Hawai; (3) Togo, India, China (?); (4)
among the Romans, Greeks, Celts, Cythians, and other barbarians.

The spear sling is a piece of wood formed either flat, like a board,
or in the shape of a rod; it is held in the right hand snd attached
at the foot of the spear. In throwing, the right arm, stretched back-
ward and holding the apparatus, is thrust forward with full force;
at the same time the spear is released. The spear sling thus length-
ens the arm of the thrower and serves as a lever to thrust the lance
forward after it has flown beyond the reach of the hand.

According to the methods by which the shng stick is fastened to
the butt of the spear, three kinds are distinguished by v. Luschan:
(1) “male;” (2) “ female,” and (3) “mixed ” (Zwitterhaften).

The male spear slings have a hook pointing toward the front, or
grip at the upper end, and the spear has a small cavity or groove
in the butt end into which the sling hook catches. The spear thus
has a support until thrown off, and at the same time can easily
release itself from the stick. In using, the native deftly catches the
hook of this sling into the cavity at the butt of the spear, so that the
instrument les parallel to the underside of the shaft, while the out-
stretched left hand grasps the spear nearer the point, the fingers
upward.” When the spear is to be thrown, “the (right) hand
grasps the sling stick as well as the weapon. Both are then turned
backward as far as the arm can reach, and the spear thrown forward
with all the might.”° One foot is generally thrust backward in

a Lauterer: Australia and Tasmania, p. 272.

The principle which y. Luschan advances (Das Wurfholz in Neu-Holland
und Mikronesien) is not entirely correct. He compares the throwing motion
with that of slinging an apple from a stick. But in this operation almost a quar-
ter circle is described by the arm and stick, with the apple as center; about the
same motion is therefore made as with the sling for stones. With the spear
sling the same motion takes place as in ordinary spear throwing, except that
the right hand does not itself hold the spear, but its continuation, the stick.

throwing,’ the discharge, therefore, occurring by the forward thrust
of the sling-lengthened arm. This male spear sling occurs in different
forms in Australia and in South America.
+ The female spear sling is provided with a groove along the upper
side, which terminates in a cavity near the outer end. Into this
groove the spear is laid lengthwise, and either its somewhat tapering
end or hook set-thereon is inserted into the cavity. (See the second
rariety of Greenland spear slings.) The spear lies firmly upon the
shaft and easily releases itself from the cavity. The use is, in gen-
eral, the same as the male spear slings. This class, with various
modifications, 1s dispersed throughout Melanesia (especially in New
Guinea), Micronesia, and Greenland.

Mixed spear slings are intermediate between the other two kinds.
In these, at the end of the grooves on the upper side, a hook whittled
from the shaft or inserted independently protrudes horizontally, or
forward somewhat obliquely. On this the hollowed end in the butt
of the spear is hooked. Its use is the same as in the other kinds.
This class has the widest dispersion, being found among the north-
eastern Asiatics, American Eskimos, in southern North America, in
Central America, and one variety in South America; also very prob-
ably in France. The spear slings of the Greenland Eskimos are some-
what analogous in construction and use.

The grips of the spear slings are greatly varied, in many classes no
special grip being present; the shaft is grasped at the smoothed end
(Austrahan). With others, on the contrary, care is taken that the
hand may have a firm hold, and that the grip may not slp out of it
easily. Tor this purpose the shaft at that point is made either rough
by indentations or notches (Australian), wrapped with hair (Austra-
lian), or covered with rosin, in which a shell or stone is often stuck,
to make a firm grip easy; a hole is made, in which the forefinger is
inserted (Eskimo) ; one or more pegs project from the border, against
which the index and other fingers rest (Eskimo, South American) ;
or, finally, a grip is set on, in which again finger holes occur (Eskimo,
Central and South American).

The operation of the spear sling is very important, as with it one
should be able to send the implement three or four times as far as
with the bare hands. The natives of Australia, for instance, hit
quite accurately at 40 paces;’ at 10 paces their spears still bear de-
struction to the victim;° and an Englishman saw a native of Port
Jackson (Sidney) aiming the spear sling at a mark 276 feet away.”

While spears can be thrown 50 to 75 feet with the bare hand, from

the spear sling they easily reach 200 to 300 feet. Indeed, according
to Clutterbuck,’ the Australians are said to have made even 150 yards
with the spear sling. Whether these last statements are entirely
accurate we can not decide, but one constantly sees references to
great distances attained by aid of the spear sling.

LOCALITIES AND TYPES.

We now turn from this general view to the localities where the
«pear sling is used, to familiarize ourselves with the types there occur-
ring.

The region in which spear slings are most frequent, even at the
present day, is Austraha. The principal weapon of the Australans
is the spear, 3 to 4 meters in length, and all Australian spears
except those used in catching fish are thrown by means of a sling,
called “ wommera,’’® which is used both in war and in the chase. It
was at one time distributed throughout Austraha, but, being sup-
planted more and more by firearms, slings are now limited to West
Austraha from the north and the territory beyond New South Wales
and Victoria.

The male type only is found in Australia, and may be divided into
two large groups. In the first the hook and shaft are in one piece,
while in the second group the hook is a separate piece (bone, tooth,
wax), often of different material than that of the shaft, fastened on
by winding with reed and thread and smeared with wax.

This first group occurs only in Melbourne and vicinity. The grip
of the shaft is rounded, often thickened by means of wax, sometimes
roughened by means of incisions to prevent the hand from slipping
during slinging. The shaft broadens toward the center and sud-
denly tapers to a point at the outer end. The under side from the
center out is slanted or rounded toward both edges, the upper side
shghtly hollowed. Very broad and very narrow forms occur, as
well as round, between which are all intermediate degrees. They
are often carved, especially on the back, with all sorts of figures and
with the line ornamentation so general in Australia (pl. 1, figs. land 2).

Those of the second group, with the hook composed of wood, bone,
tooth, or wax set into the outer end of the handle, are subdivided into
two types, with numerous subdivisions. ‘Type I comprises broader
or narrower blades, or those slightly hollowed on the under side,
while Type IT is of round shafts. Type I again falls into two sub-
divisions: (a@) The spear sling is more or less broad, therefore leaf-
shaped; the hook is fastened at the upper end upon one side; (0)

SLING CONTRIVANCES FOR PROJECTILE WEAPONS. 623

the slings are likewise rather broad, the hook not fastened to the flat
surface but to the edge of the shaft. The spear slings with the hook
upon the face are found from King Georges Sound to Geography
Bay," in the great west Australian desert, in Nullagine, on the table-
land, and by the Sherlock River.” The second kind is therefore
restricted to West Australia. It is a thin, extremely broad, long-oval
board, often hollow on the upper side and slightly curved upon the
lower, the small wooden hook is set upon the face, so that great wind
resistance 1s overcome during use; why the shaft is so wide is not
known; at least, no advantage is to be derived from the breadth.
The grip is composed of a lump of gum, applied either symmetrically
or slightly sidewise, from which protrudes a piece of shell or stone,
the latter serving for a firmer grip, sharpening the spear points, and
generally as a cutting instrument, since it has an edge.” This type of
spear sling is quite abundant (pl. 1, fig. 3). The type found among
the Nannines (West Australia)? is similar, it is a not very broad,
parallel-sided, flat stick, about 1.20 meters long, tapering at both
ends. The wooden hook is attached above. on the face, a piece of
gum is applied for a grip, in which is a piece of shell or stone
(pl. 1, fig. 4). 'This leads to the type used from Beagle Bay north-
ward as far as Port Darwin,’ at Carpenter Gulf, and in the northern
territory of South Australia; perhaps even farther inland to the
Eiry Lake.e The shaft is of nearly the same form as the preceding,
execept that it is not parallel-sided, but tapers toward the outer end.
The grip is clearly defined and allows a firm grasp. The hook being
bound to the shaft with cords and gum, the entire shaft is then
covered with a reddish earth. Decorative figures are often carved
upon the sides (pl. 1, fig. 5).

The type found from Port Darwin to Port Essington and on Mel-
ville Island is quite as flat, narrow, and pointedy it differs from the
foregoing in that the shafts are bent and very elastic. The handle
consists of a pear-shaped piece of gum. That. part of the shaft next
the grip is ornamented in lines. What advantage these particular
shafts present is not known, as they are elastic, they permit a bow
thrust, and at all events, they make throwing a greater distance pos-
sible. They are quite rare (pl. 1, fig. 6). A class which but partly

belongs to this group is used on the Murray River. The grip is
very long and cylindrical; the shaft then swells to a broad central

portion, arched underneath and flat on top, which graduates toward
the outer end and terminates into a rounded staff, where a kangaroo
tooth is fastened. The grip is made rough or has opossum fur applied
to prevent the slipping of the fingers. This kind forms the transition
to the second type, the rounded stick (pl 1, fig. 5).

The second group of the first type is of broader or narrower shafts,
to which the hook is attached, not upon the face, but upon the edge.
They are found particularly upon the Cape York Peninsuia and in
northern Queenland; perhaps also in New South Wales. Certain
‘ariations again appear within this type: On one kind, usual on Cape
York Peninsula, two long oval shells are attached slantingly above.
Whether these serve merely as a grip for the hand or some further
advantage is to be attained through them is not known (pl. 1, fig. 8).

Another kind, also from Cape York Peninsula, is substantially
narrower and shorter and does not have the shell, but a quite smooth
grip, which, however, has distinct lashings. It may be that the shell
has been lost; in that event both these types would be in a single
group (pl. 1, fig. 9). Lastly, a third type similar to the boomerang
occurs in northern Queensland. As the tooth protrudes beyond the
edge, it is quite probable that this shaft was also a boomerang,
and is a doubly useful weapon (pl. 1, fig.’10.) Only with these
three weapons is it possible to swing the stick in a circle, accord-
ing to v. Luschan’s principle. But at all events, as the hook is on
the edge, these three types serve to develop the utmost slinging
force of the shaft, for by it the wind resistance is easily overcome
and distance and accuracy substantially increased. These are, per-
haps, the most perfect spear slings in Australia. One reported by
Klemm “¢ may also belong here, as it occurs at Port Jackson and in
the vicinity of Sydney. He merely says that a native attained a
distance of 276 feet with the spear sling. He characterizes the
implements generally as 5 feet long, with a small peg or hook at the
outer end and a shell at the opposite for ornament, which serves as a
grip.

The second type of the second group presents long, rounded shafts,
and is usual in northeastern Australia, especially in the northern
territory. These are plain, rounded shafts about 1.20 meters long,
tapering slightly toward the outer end. The grip is thickened by
means of concentric layers of gum? or wound with cords twisted
from human hair, showing a large tuft at the end,’ and the hook is a

large wooden tooth or a lump of gum which ends in a sharp point
(Goligse ys nt cs Gi ;

Luschan “ gives ten or twelve sharply defined types of Australian
spear slings, which are characteristic of the localities where found.
These types have been discarded here, and a new division made
as follows: The chief characteristic on the spear sling is the hook.
According to its various modes of attachment, spear slings are
divided into those having hook and shaft in one piece, and those in
which the hook is attached independently. The latter, according to
shape, have broad shafts, board-shaped, or round shafts, with two
smaller groups of those with hook on the face and those with hook
on the edge.

In the greater or less breadth of the shafts, in the variety of grips,
in the straight or twisted forms of shafts, there are not such varieties
for characterizing a main division as in the different fastenings of the
hook, the principal piece on the male spear sling. All these slight
differences must be regarded as local modifications of the present
main type.

The second area in which spear slings appear is northeast from
Australia, in Melanesia, or, rather New Guinea and Micronesia, in
which area spear slings are chiefly used as weapons of war,? whether
also of the chase there are no accounts. It probably Sri spread
through Melanesia and Micronesia, but is known only from New
Guinea, the Iiji Islands, the Carolines, Pelew, and Marianas. Ac-
cording to type, only female spear slings occur here.

We can further distinguish two groups of spear slings—those with
a piece and those without a piece attached. The former occurs in
New Guinea only, and the spear sling is here on the German north
coast as far as Astrolabe Bay, covering Empress Augusta River,’
Cape della Torre,’ Venus Hook,’ Hansa Inlet,’ Hatzfeldhafen,’ Cape
Gourdon,’ Hammaker River Astrolabe Bay,’ where they are very
numerous and always beautifully worked.” This spear sling is made
of a shaft of bamboo 60 to 80 centimeters long, cut off so that one
end (the upper) terminates at a knot. About two-fifths of its length
(measured from grip) the shaft is split off in such manner that at one
end one-fourth and at the other three-fourths of its thickness is cut

away. The knot at the end is retained and shows a small excavation.
The spear belonging to this, 2.50 to 8 meters long, has in the middle,
near the center of gravity, a short hook bent backward, artistically
fastened to the shaft with a rattan or bast binding. In use, the spear
is laid lengthwise in the furrow of the sling, but in such manner that
the little wooden hook catches into the hollow at the knot.t The
spear thus has a support in throwing outward and releasing, but still
does not lie-firmly enough to enable it to hit a mark. To achieve
that, and to assure a certain direction of flight, an attached piece is
placed between the beginning of the groove and the grip, always
lying in a groove by itself. Beginning at the grip, it rises at a slant
of some 10 centimeters above the beginning of the groove and is
securely bound to the shaft with string bands. It does not le on a line
with the spear groove, but alongside and parallel. It is whittled from
wood and ornamented with great care, the favorite forms carved
being those of animals, kangaroo, rhinoceros birds, and crocodiles
frequently appearing as attached pieces, often completely convention-
alized so that their meaning is obscured (pl. 1, fig. 12).

As already indicated, the purpose is to give the spear a firm sup-
port to hinder its gliding off. In use, therefore, the hook is inserted
into the cavity, the spear laid imto the groove with the right side
leaning against the attached piece, where it is tightly pressed with

the thumb, the fingers clasping the grip, the attached piece here
taking the place, so to speak, of fingers (v. Luschan). The grip
is simply the smooth reed, seldom ornamented, but often covered
with plaited work, so that the hand has a firm hold, while at the
knot are all kinds of decorations, notched carvings and plaited bands,
which are at the same time to hold the reed from splitting. The
motion in slinging off is the same as with the Australian spear slings
(pl. 1, figs. 18 and 18a).

All other spear slings in Melanesia and Micronesia are without
attached piece. They have probably died out here entirely, for
examples are little known. There are many reports of their appear-
ance in this district, but the fact is announced without giving pre-
cise description of the stick and its weapon. Waitz mentions spear
slings of the Fiji Islands. (Anthropologie der Naturvélker, VI, p.
597 et seq.) The weapons are here beautifully worked. ‘They are

Weule in Leipzig. Doctor Liese was in New Guinea for a long time and there
saw this practice, and upon his return brought several examples which are now .
in the museum at Leipzig. Doctor Weule demonstrated with these. Compare
therewith vy. Luschan: Das Wurfholz, p. 148, whose opinion, accordingly, is
incorrect,

also mentioned from the Caroline Islands, the Philippines, New
Guinea, and Pelew Island. _

In type these shafts:were similar to those of New Guinea, even to
the piece attached and the finer execution (pl. 1, fig. 14). The
spears there have no spine set on, as those from New Guinea; it is
therefore presumed that the sharp butts of the spears are stuck into
the hollow at the outer end of the spear sling, and are held securely
by the first, second, and fourth fingers of the right hand. The prac-
tice 1s, therefore, nearly the same as in Australian spear slings. An
attached piece is, of course, superfluous. Report is made of another
use of spear slings in the Pelew Islands; the elastic bamboo spear
is set with its point in the groove of the shaft, the left hand holds
the spear toward the outer end and inclines it more or less according
to the distance sought. When the hand is removed the spear flies and
usually falls perpendicularly upon its target.¢| Reports of Chamiso
from Yap will probably be similar, that the spear was shot from the
bow with the aid-of a trough-shaped piece of bamboo.

The third area in which spear slings are found, having much
variety in shaft and quite extensive use in hunting on the water, even
though it is being supplanted by firearms, is the polar regions.?
‘They are used there among the Giliaks (Amur district and Sag-
halin), among certain northeast Asiatic races, upon the Aleutian
Islands, on the shores of Alaska, on the north coast of America,
in Labrador, Greenland, and among the Eskimos generally. The
Greenlander, whose artistic spear slings will be considered further
on, 1s here omitted. According to the provision for the forefinger,’
three groups are distinguished: (1) A hole for the forefinger is cut
on the side of the shaft to the right from the spear groove; (2) the
pocket or cavity for forefinger is placed on the central line of the
under side and, if it goes through, terminates in the spear groove ; and
(3) a notch for the forefinger is cut to the right of the grip, from
behind which protrudes a peg. We find the first group in Labrador,
Baffinsland, along the entire northern coast of North America, in
Alaska, on the Fox and Aleutian islands, as among the Giliaks, and
certain northeast Asiatics. It is usually a broad strip of wood, taper-
ing more or less to a point at the outer end. A groove for the spear
is made on the flat upper side, from the end of which projects a small
bone hook (this is not fastened with gum and bindings, as in the case

¢'The plan has been arranged according to the provisions for the forefinger,
as this is the most distinguishing characteristic of these north-country sling
sticks. This division makes possible a simple grouping of the different kinds,
and a clear view of their distribution in these areas, both geographically and
ethnographically.
628 SLING CONTRIVANCES FOR PROJECTILE WEAPONS.

of the Australian sticks, but is inserted in the shaft). The groove
deepens as it approaches the hook; toward the opposite end it becomes
shallower and terminates in the handle. To the right of this groove,
at the more or less distinctly defined grip, is a hole through which the
forefinger is placed durmg use, making impossible the slipping of the
board. The grip either is quite smooth on the edges or has notches
for the fingers. The spear, thick, heavy, and harpoonlike, has a eav-
ity at its square end into which the hook of the spear sling fits when
in use, while the spear itself les in the groove. The left band holds
the spear toward the point, otherwise the mode of shooting is simi-
lar to that of the Australian spear slings. Shght modifications of
this variety, all pertaining to the grip, are noted in different localities
in the polar regions.“

Why are such distinct handles encountered here in the north? The
answer is easy. Because of the small diameter of the forefinger hole
it is not possible to use gloves; the natives are, therefore, forced to
take hold of the spear slings with the bare hand. Even then, be-
cause of the strong jerk in throwing off, the last-named tend to glide
out of the hand. How much more will it not be the case when cold-
benumbed hands try to hold the smooth shaft? It-is necessary, there-
fore, to attain the firmest possible grasp, which, as we have seen, has
been done with these artistic grips. The most perfect in this regard
is the shaft of the Mahlemut, in which all the good qualities are in-
cluded—distinet handle, thumb groove, forefinger pocket on under
side, finger grooves on the side, with peg and finger-tip cavity, shaft
groove, and end hook. As to our three principal kinds, the first is
from Baffinsland and Labrador onward over the entire north coast
of North America as far as northeast Asia, and returns to America
through the Giliaks, Aleuts, Unalaskans, and Kadiak islanders as
far as Prince William Sound. It is important to notice that this
variety is to be found among the northeast Asiatics, Gillaks, and
Aleuts, since this might help to prove the relationship of these iso-
lated peoples to the Eskimos in a broader sense, in addition to other
similarities.

We now come to the spear slings of Greenland. ‘Three varieties
are also used here, which are attached to the spear by an entirely
new method. The spear slings lying before me are genuine works
of art, wrought probably with iron tools and ornamented with in-
layings of bone. They were finished off upon the order of a Green-
land missionary who was having a complete Kajak outfit made for

the shaft and the grip, which are omitted in this translation. ‘They are illus-

himself; but, having no use for it, it was transferred, still new, to
the possession of the Leipzic Museum fiir Volkerkunde, together
with three spear slings and ail appurtenances. The first variety is a
shaft 48 centimeters in length, tapering slightly toward the outer
end about 5 to 8 centimeters broad, called * Norsék” (‘ Vogel-
wurfbrett ”), according to Virchow, which is used for throwing in a
straight line, and is also used in this manner in Labrador (pl. rit, figs.
20 to 80e). The upper side is flat; the under slanted off both ways
from a central line. In the middle of the upper side a groove shallows
from the start and stops short before reaching the outer end of the
stick, so that a small, smooth space is left. Upon this a tapering
bone hook is attached, leaning toward the front and projecting over
the groove. On both sides of the grip are thin bone pieces somewhat
tapering, which secure a firmer grip. No ornamentation is present
in this kind. A very ingenious harpoon is thrown with this, having
a quite strong, round shaft, 1.15 meters long. At the butt end a bone
plate is set, which is so hollowed out that the point of the spear-shng
hook fits exactly into it. The comparatively long iron head with
harpoon blade is so fastened that when the toggle strikes it remains
in the animal and is still connected with the shaft by means of a
leather line. The shaft now turns downward and takes a perpen-
dicular position in the water and a bladder attached at the other end
easily holds the shaft upon the surface of the water and shows the
hunter the position of the animal. .The method of throwing is the
same as with Australian sticks.

The second variety is even more ingenious. It is female, and the
groove extends from front to back, the shape and the handle being
otherwise the same as with the first variety. Two holes in the groove
are to be noted, one occurring about the middle of the grip, the other
in a bone set on at the end of the groove fitting into it. The hole is
not perpendicular, but slants backward. The shaft is decorated
with five carved walrus-ivory pieces inserted in each side of the edge
(pl. m1, figs. 31. a toe). The accompanying harpoon is 2 meters long,
with solid iron point inserted into a piece of bone. The thick shaft,
at 20 centimeters beyond the center of gravity, has two bone pegs
corresponding to the holes in the spear slings, and set backward to
fit into them. In use the spear is laid in the groove of the spear
sling, the pegs fitted into their holes. The shaft then still projects
50 centimeters backward beyond the board. The spear sling is not
applied at the end, but quite in the center of the spear (as with those
from New Guinea). In slinging, according to Virchow,” the thrower
gives a slight push upward, so that the first peg rises from the shaft;

the second hook, as it is placed slantingly backward, easily releases
itself from the shaft, and serves to help it in swinging off. A
strongly curved thrust is attained after the first push in swinging
off. This implement is used in hunting aquatic animals, for which
a curved thrust from the kaiak is necessary.

The third variety is most interesting. Its shaft is generally of the
same form as the foregoing, except that it tapers suddenly at the
outer end to the half of its width. The grip is about the same as
the preceding, the reverse, slanting toward each side, is not decorated.
The shallow groove runs from front to back. Eight centimeters dis-
tant from the inner end, in the center of the groove, isa hole, which
narrows toward the bottom. In the groove at the upper end a narrow
bone about 6 centimeters long is inserted, which bends upward and
forward to a hook extending from the end of the weapon (pl. m1,
figs. 32 a to e). The harpoon accompanying it, called “ erneinek ”
(Klemm), is 1.60 meters long, somewhat thicker front and back than
in the center, and leveled. The bone point is bound fast to the shaft,
on the butt end is a bone plate with a small hollow, on both sides
of this a long, flat, broad piece of bone is attached, formed lke a
shuttle (Klemm), which extends about 12 centimeters over the end.
Both these plates are very ingeniously fastened by means of small
bone rivets. Thirty-seven to forty-two centimeters from the back end
a bone hook is struck through the shaft at right angles, so that the
hook nearest that end is on a level with the flat surface of both bone
plates. In use the hook of the spear sling grips into the cavity of the
end plate between the two prolonged flat bones. The other hook, 37
centimeters distant, grips into the hole in the shaft, which is supported
by the left hand. Again an upward push is given from the front, so
that the spear releases itself from the board. The back hook then
gives the proper swing and direction, and thus results a curved
thrust. Both the side pieces of bone at the back end serve, according
to Klemm, to make the aim straighter and surer. They therefore
serve the same purpose as the feathers at the end of the arrow. At
the second hook an 8-fathom-long leather line (Klemm) is fastened
by means of a bone ring. So it is seen how the Eskimos, “ with much
intelligence, with simple appliances, have provided themselves with
an implement for the main purpose of their existence, the hunt, which
allows them to take their prey at considerable distance from their
kaiaks and with the greatest safety.” (Virchow.)

The last area of distribution of the spear sling is Central and
South America. It was used both in the chase and in war. The
spear sling was in use, probably till the end of the conquest (1530),
in Utah, Colorado, California, Florida, Mexico, Yucatan, on the

south) in Columbia; Ecuador, Peru, and in the Amazon River dis.
trict, east Peru, and north Brazil. 1t is still in use in Michoacan,
on Lake Patzcuaro, and in Brazil among the tribes of the upper
Xingu and Araguaya. There are three types—one androgynous
and two male. The androgynous form is the old Mexican atlatl.
The shaft is thin and not very strong. For a grip it is hollowed
out on the edges, and a leather thong forms a loop on either side for
the second and third fingers, or a piece of shell is attached to the
back; ora piece cut from shell¢ is placed on each side of the handle;
or braided cords” take the place of the thong; or, in rude types, a
crosspiece only is attached, which projects to right and left.
Finally, there is a groove in the center, or often one at both sides of
the shaft. San Marcos, Fla.,° Santa Barbara, Cal.¢ The grip .is
like one from Greenland (see pl. mi, fig. 33). On the front a
furrow diminishes toward the outer end, where a peg protrudes.
In the class made of rings of shell a piece of hide is attached,’ by
the aid of which the third and fourth fingers press against the board
from beneath. The upper end was often decorated with feathers,
hair tufts, or narrow thongs. Sometimes a transparent quartz peb-
ble was attached (according to Starr, 5) as a luck stone (see pl.
iv, fig. 34). In use the second and third fingers hook into their
rings, the spear is laid into the groove, and the cavity at the end
rests against the peg. The first, fourth, and fifth fingers encircling
the shaft hold the spear securely upon the sling. This form was
still in use about the time of the discovery of America. In the
deseriptions and ilustrations of Spanish historians of the conquest
they are incorrectly drawn and explained.’ It was used in war, but
oftener in the chase and in fishing It appears in ancient calendars
and picture writings, especially associated with the sun god Tona-
tiuh or Niuhpilli, the fire god Niuhtecutli, and of Tezcatlipoca,” as
seen in the works of Durian, Torquemada; Ramusio, Oviedo, Ro-

dwellings and tombs—for instance, from the mummy caves of the
hacienda del Coyote, in Coahuila,’ or from San Marco, Fla.,? Santa
Barbara, Cal.,° Utah,’ and southwestern Colorado, and besides the
ordinary ones, several magnificent examples, certainly not intendéd
for use, being richly ornamented with carvings, paintings, and
gilding, and representing temple decorations, and probably dedi-
cated to the rain goddess Tlaloc,’ as they show her symbol. These
beautiful examples come from Tlaxiaco, in Mixtec, in the street of a
Pueblo toward Oaxaca.°

The same type still appears at this day in spear slings used in
Michoacan on Lake Patzcuaro.’ There is no account from ancient
times that this type was in use in war, but it is still employed in
hunting water fowl’ on Lake Patzcuaro, the flat shores being coy-
ered with bamboo thickets in which thousands of ducks nest. The
spears are about 2 to 8 meters long and have a_ three-pronged
pomt. The spear sling from this area is flat on the upper side and
half round on the lower, 60 centimeters long, with round grip, which
broadens into a flat piece which has two holes for the third and
fourth fingers. (Doctor Seler also mentioned’ that the shafts from
Patzcuaro Lake, of which Mason gives first notice, had ears cut from
shells, tied on with cotton cord, one on each side, for the third and
fourth fingers. According to these writers, the shafts are very simi-
lar to those of the ancient Mexicans). The shaft narrows outward
and has a broad deep groove on the upper side, at the end of which a
small hook is carved from the shaft. The grip is cut to fit the hand
and terminates in a hook which serves to draw the spear out of the
water (see pl. rv, figs. 835 and 36). .This type was employed in Utah.

déro)” Palenque in Guatemala,? Panama,’ Province of Cueva (after
Oviedo’), in addition -probably also on the Greater Antilles and
Lucayas (Bahama Islands °).

According to Starr the spear sling is still in use on the inner angle
of the Atlantie Gulf coast, in Tenanpulco, in Apulo, and at Tecohitla
and Nanthla River. Another shaft is here to be mentioned which is
probably the prototype of the Mexican. It is from Santa Barbara,
Cal., and seems shorter than any other known’! (see pl. tv, fig. 37).
The shaft is broad and thick and about one and one-half times as
long as wide. On the upper side, extending from the front, is a
narrow groove which ends at two-thirds of the distance. At the
outer end a sharp tooth bent forward protrudes. Two finger holes.
one at each side of the groove, are bored through the shaft, as in the
spear shngs of Florida and Lake Patzcuaro. It is assumed that this
is the original of the Mexican spear sling; for, first, the short length
is proof that the evolution of the spear sling is here in its first stage:
secondly, ancient illustrations of spear slings not much longer are to
be seen in Doctor Seler: Intern. Arch., Volume ITT, page 159, figure 4
(see fig. 88), the Codex Mendoza; thirdly, Mrs. Nuttall mentions, as
"a weapon of war, a spar sling only 23 centimeters long.

The second type was in use in northwestern South America. In
Colombia, among the Chibchas;% in Ecuador, among the Purahaes
(according to Cieca) as in the vicinity of the Latacunga; beyond
this, mainly on the highlands (Oviedo, Valesco), and Quito,” on the
Riobamba,’ as in Peru,’ quite common. No spear sling now occurs
there. All that we know of it is learned, either from deseriptions
and illustrations in Spanish writers, from facsimiles in gold (for
example those of Chibcha in the Leipzig Museum), from pictures
on pottery (Peru), or from a few examples still in existence (from
(Quito, in Rome; from Riobamba, discovered by Mia. Reiss). This
type is entirely different and decidedly masculine. A rough stick

has close to the grip a hook of wood, stone (Chibcha), or bone
(Quito), at an angle of 90 degrees. Near the upper end the shaft
broadens into a small disk handle (see pl. tv, fig. 89); in using, the
right hand grasps this disk, and the forefinger the side hook there
found, the spear, as usual, being set against the upper hook. These
are abundant in collections? a number being in the Leipzig Museum,
showing that at one time the spear sling was widely dispersed
and much used (see pl. iv, fig. 40). The typical form of this hook
is a small straight base with a fluke joined to it by means of a
slanting neck seldom running directly upright. The whole was fas-
tened to the end of the shaft by lashing in twine. Besides these
plain examples, still others more decorated occur, many having
bird forms, for example the hook of the arrow slings of the Ozonanes,
now in Rome (see pl. rv, fig. 41). In the areas of these hooks there
is a means of deciding the former distribution of spear slings. Some
were found in Colombia, in Boyoca, and in Chile, on the borders of
Ecuador; in Ecuador, in Culpi on the Riobamba, and in Azognes.
It is from this area that Reiss brought the similar half-modern
example from guano on the Riobamba. This ancient pattern seems.
to be that found in Quito, now in Rome.?

The third type is the Brazilian. It is still used in the chase, in
tortoise-catching, and in war’ among the peoples of the Magda-
lena and Amazon river district: (1) By the Tecunas, Cocamas, Com-
bos, Campevas, Sorimoes; (2) by the Cauca and Patyagora stocks,
and the Paez; (3) by the Canamaris, Purupurus, Paumari. It is
still in use among the peoples of the upper Ningu and Araguaya;
and (4) by the Aueto, Kamayura, Trumai, Suya, Karaya.

The spear slings of these four groups are of the male type, with a
hole or pocket for the forefinger in the center of the under side. The
first group shows quite a broad, thick shaft, flat above and arched
below. It broadens perceptibly in the middle, and there is a good
grip for the hand. On the under side of the middle is a rectangular
ravity for the forefinger. A hook is attached to the upper side of
the outer end (see pl. iv, fig. 42). This type was in use for tortoise
harpoons,? among the Tecunas,’? Cocamas,’ and Conibos.’ Perhaps
the type of the Campevas or Omaguas and Sorimoes (in Tefle-Ega ’).

Tecunas. Still, the latter also mention a groove or a cross piece,
and isolated examples are found among old Indians of these tribes,
who use them in fishing. — The type of this class is not yet determined.

The second group embraces a type of which two examples were
found in huaecas, at Manizales, in southern Antioquia, now in the
Copenhagen Museum.’ They have the inner end thin and flat, with
broad center piece as grip, in which is the finger hole and pointed end.
The outer end is like a staff, and terminates in a knob with a scroll,
into the upper surface of which a short, narrow groove is cut for the
insertion of the hook (missing). A band passing across this held the
hook still more firmly “ (see pl. tv, figs. 48a and 48b). This, aceord-
ing to Bahnson, is the type of the Cauca spear sling. Uhle suggests
that sling sticks with a groove probably existed in the Cauca Val-
ley, and were in use among -the Cauca tribes, and certainly in
Antioquia, in the Aburra Valley opposite (according to Cieca, Rob-
ledo), to the south in Arma (according to Cieca), in the district of
Ori, Cartama (on the left bank of the Cauca opposite Arma), Pozo
to the south, among certain peoples related to the population of
Arma (according to Robledo), Quimbaya, opposite Carthage (accord.
ing to Cieca), and among the Pantagora tribes, on the upper Cauca
and Maedalenian valley (according to Piedratuta) ; also by the Paez
in the mountainous countries between these two rivers.”

In the third group the hole for the forefinger is placed in a space
adjoining the grip. The shaft is flat like a ruler, broadish at each
end and narrower in the midle. The hole for the forefinger, on the
back, is between two cross bars. A small groove is supposed to have
existed in some examples. The hook for the spear end is a tooth-
shaped bone attached to the extreme end of the shaft (see pl. rv,
fio. 44). In former times it was employed among the Purupurus
(two examples in Vienna), Canamaris (a few examples still used
in fish and turtle catching on the. Jurua River in 1867 were en-
countered by Chandless), and by the Paumaris on the Upper Purus.°
The fourth subclass is still in use. The shaft is a delicate rod (on
the Araguaya it is angular in section), with broad flat handle in-
curved on both sides. Near the place where the grip changes into
the shaft is a hole for the forefinger. Toward the upper end the
shaft tapers to a pomt, where is lashed obliquely a small hook of
wood or, among the Karaya, of bone (see pl. tv, fig. 45). It
formerly served as a fighting weapon only, but is now mostly used
in sport, and as such is very popular. The spear sling dance, called
“vauari,” also shows this, in which the wounding and death of a

warrior with one of these weapons is portrayed." Spears are not
thrown with these, but a ight arrow with a dull head for stunning.
Instead of a point, a heavy stone or piece of wood is attached with
cords and gum, or merely wax balls or tucum nuts serve as heads
(see pl. iv, fig. 46). The shaft is often decorated at the upper
hook with bunches of gay feathers. There is a smaller spear sling
for children. Ehrenreich found such among the Karaya. This
type, according to Karl v. den Steinen® and Doctor Ehrenreich,”
is used among the Suya, Trumai, Kamayura, Auét6 on the Xingu,
and by the Karayé on the Araguaya. In conclusion, there is still
another spear sling from Brazil, of mixed type, which does not fit
into this scheme and has nothing in common with the American
spear slings. The shaft is flat on the upper side and half round
below. It has a groove running the whole distance on the upper side,
bounded by narrow lath-lke borders. The outer end is flat and
oblong and covered with a neat braid of cotton cords, which holds
the peg firmly to the end of the groove. There is no distinct grip.
The outer end of the shaft is decorated with two bunches of human
hair (see pl. iv, fig. 47). According to Bahnson,° after comparison
with two illustrations in the Copenhagen Museum, one may assume
that it was indigenous to the tribes of the Tupi nation.

Thus, in Central and South America are three restricted areas of
the distribution of the spear sling. The Mexican type extends from
Utah to Panama; the second is indigenous to Colombia, Ecuador,
and Peru; the third has been and still is used, in part, in Colombia,
eastern Peru, northern and eastern Brazil. Each of the three types
is in itself a complete unit, and the third in contradistinction to the
other two. But between these three types themselves no relationship
is discoverable; each is distinctly foreign to the other. A common
prototype can not here be thought of. But a relationship between
the shafts of the Eskimo and those of American type might be con-
sidered, as Mason suggests. Both are of the mixed type, and in the
grip occurs here one or two, there one, finger hole. But all connect-
ing links between the most southerly Eskimo shafts (Sitka) and the
most northerly Mexican types (Utah) fail.

Another means ot increasing the distance of flight and accuracy of
aim is the projectile sling or thong.

Two principles are distinguished, the first serving to strengthen
the propulsion. Small cords are loosely attached to the spear or

SLING CONTRIVANCES FOR PROJECTILE WEAPONS. 637

small loops are tightly fastened. The second assists the rotation and
the center of gravity-by means of a longer cord wound around the
spear, setting it in rotation when released.

The first type, which is used in war as well as the chase, is in two
groups—(«a) a throwing strap loosely attached to the spear; and (/)
a cord fastened to the spear.

The first group is found in New Caledonia, New Hebrides, and
New Zealand, with a variety in New Zealand and Hawau.*

The projectile thong is a short cord braided from cocoa fiber or bat
hairs, which has at one end a loop and at the other a knot, and which
is called in New Guinea “sipp” (see pl. rv, fig. 49). The spear
belonging to this, from 8 to 4 meters in length, has a hook back of the
center of gravity, finely carved from the shaft, and usually represent-
ing a man’s head; the spear also is beautifully ornamented with
wrappings of hair and feather tufts. In use the loop is thrust over
the thumb ” or little finger,’ while the knot is placed back of the hook
on the spear. In throwing, the spear, grasped by the left hand near
the point, draws the cord tightly toward the right. The releasing
is accomplished as with the ordinary spear except that the cord
assists the final rotation and the knot releases itself readily from the
knob, so that by this “the force of the throw is much increased.” ?
Forster (Vol. IT, pp. 220 and 304) suggests that the projectile thong,
after.the knot was fastened back of the knob, was wrapped around
the spear (see pl. rv, fig. 49).

A subclass, which shows the combination of the shaft and the pro-
jectile thong, occurs in New Zealand and Hawai. Schurtz reports,
in Urgeschichte der Kultur, that a simple wooden spear fastened to
the snare with the aid of a stick was used in New Zealand, which
released at the proper instant when thrown. This was called * ko-
taha,” and the spear used in connection was called “ kopere.”

The second group shows a small leather loop fastened to the spear.
It appears in Togo and in India. Numerous spears from ‘Togo are
found in the Leipzig Museum, 1.8 meters in length, with lanceolate
iron point and a long iron spud. About 20 centimeters back of the
center of gravity there is a small leather loop about 4 centimeters in
length (see pl. tv, fig. 50). No literature on these spears is at hand
and about their use nothing is known. Egerton (Handbook of In-
dian Arms, p. 12, pl. 2, fig. 6; and p. 79, pl. 72, figs. 72 and 75) gives
numerous illustrations of spears from India which also have a loop

around the shaft. In the spear on page 12 (next to fig. 1) the long
loop is shown quite near the point, while in the spears of the Dravida
and Tamuls, on page 79 (figs. 2 and 3), quite broad flat loops are
found at about the center of the spear.

The second type of projectile noose aids the spear in attaining a
forward rotary motion. We come upon it in the roller straps of the
Greeks and Romans. The spear thong seen with this is called * hasta.
amentata.”

The thong spear was originally in use in Greek gymnasiums, then
it became a hunting weapon of the northern hunting peoples (tol-
ians, Acarnanians, Locrians, Thessalians, Thracians, Scythians, ete.),
until it was finally adopted as the universal projectile weapon of the
peltasts. It was also sometimes employed by horsemen. Among the
Romans it was first adopted through Pyrrhus, and from then on was
the standard weapon of the light armed, who carried five to seven.

The tragula of the Gauls seems also to have been such a strap spear,
according to Cesar.“ It is pictured by numerous writers, as well as
in plastic and pictorial illustrations, 1. e., in the vase pictures of the
British Museum; bronze disk picture of gina, in Berlin; Etruscan
vase (illustrated by Hamilton ITT, 33); pictures on vases copied by
O. Jahn, Millingen; grave pictures from Paestum, copied by Springer
(Kunstgeschichten I, p. 115); and the slaughter of Alexander, in
mosaic. The spear, upon which the strap was buttoned, was probably,
with the point, about 4 feet long and but a finger breadth in diameter.
The point was usually extremely long, thin, and fine, so that it bent
after the first throw, which made it impossible to use it a second time.
The thong was narrow, cut from leather, at the most an ell in length,
and the ends were usually sewed, buttoned, or buckled together.
The strap was tightly fastened to the spear by means of a single or
double wrapping, back of the center of gravity, therefore at different
parts of the spear, according to the weight of the iron point. In
throwing, the noose was drawn taut, whereby the rotation was caused,
the strap unwinding itself and revolving the spear lengthwise. The
strap remained hanging to the spear, the more seriously injuring
the wounded.

MATERIALS USED TO WRITE UPON BEFORE THE
INVENTION OF ERINTING.@

By ALBERT MAIRE,

Librarian of the University of Paris.

The subject treated here is not new; it is to be found, indeed, in
many works, or scattered in special reviews, in monographs, and notes
upon the history of writing and upon the methods and materials used
for that purpose. But a synthetic presentation of this knowledge in
a definitive form has thus far not been attempted. It is at once
curious and instructive; connected, on the one hand, with the history
of the evolution of languages and of writing, and,on the other, with’
a portion of human industry. It is, in a word, a contribution to the
sociological history of mankind.

The patient research of linguists and the comparative study of the
most ancient styles of writing have led to the enunciation of the idea
that certain signs or rudimentary drawings of a kind still used
by the uncivilized of our day were employed at the very origin of
writing—pictographic writing.

First let us have a definition of writing; the one Monsieur Philippe
Berger gives: “ It is the art of fixing the word by conventional signs,
traced by the hand, which are termed characters. Characters may
represent ideas or sounds. We term ideographic writing such as is
used. to give us the ideas directly; phonetic writing, such as expresses
by characters the sounds of the word. Writing differs from design
in that it is inseparable from language. If, in ideographie writing,
the characters are pictures of certain ideas or certain objects, they
are recalled to the mind under the form which they assume in speech ;
that is to say, through the medium of the word. All systems of
writing which were in the beginning purely ideographic became, by
degrees, syllabic. The distinction between alphabetic and non-.
alphabetic writing is the only one which corresponds with historic
reality.” ®

640 MATERIALS TO WRITE UPON BEFORE INVENTION OF PRINTING.

We can not here relate the history of the evolution of the various
styles of writing; the aim of these pages is to make known the
materials that have been used to write upon.

In giving the history of the materials and processes which have
brought down to us the annals and ideas of humanity, this description.
of the methods adopted by man to develop the expression of an idea
and to make that idea penetrate simultaneously the intelligence of
the human species becomes a history of humanity itself.

Do we not return to the source of this humanity, of its beginnings
and its progress in civilization, in seeking the manner in which
thought came to be fixed in tangible form and transmitted through
the ages? Before the first peoples with a history—the Egyptians,
Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Chinese, Hindoos, American Indians—

research is litthe more than hypothesis. An impenetrable obscurity
rests over those distant times in which man was concerned only with
his material wants.

Man looked round about him. From the first nature offered him
products which asked only to be utilized. Stones and marble, metals,
wood, the bark of trees and their leaves, the skins of animals and
their intestines, tissues, and artificial products of all kinds contempo-

raneously or successively received the impress of sculpture, painting,
cr the inseription of human actions and thoughts. In every case
where it is possible to cite an example we shall do so. Some figures
which complement the facts adduced, and will perhaps be helpful to a
comprehension of the subject, have been scattered through the text.

But before starting in on any methodical plan we must speak of
some mnemonic devices which bear a distant relation to writing.
They were, however, intended to perpetuate the memory of the deeds
or condition of an individual.

ROCKS, CRUDE AND PLANED, BUT NOT DETACHED.

The rupestrine inscriptions, probably the most ancient of all, are

rectly upon the rough

ROCKS CUT INTO TABLES OR BUILDING STONES.

It requires no great effort to find inscriptions of this kind. As
civilization developed, man began to prepare with care the material
upon which he wished to write or carve. Throughout the Orient,
from Egypt to India, monuments constructed of dressed stones are
covered with carvings or pictures, explained and commented upon by
inscriptions (fig. 17). The Greeks and the Romans employed stone
tables for the purpose of engraving laws, public and commemorative
records. The funeral cippi and stele of nearly all nations are cov-
ered with inscriptions, and likewise the coffins of stone and wood.

Are not our modern cemeteries like an immutable obituary, or,
better still, like a huge biographical dictionary ?

Inscriptions upon stones of all kinds—marble, sandstone, granite,
slate—are so frequently met with around us that it seems superfluous
to cite examples.

The baked earths deserve special mention on account of their
preparation and their antiquity. In ancient times the Persians,
Medes, and Assyrians were about the only nations that customarily
made use of clay, either dried or baked, for writing upon (fig. 18)¢,
inscriptions of this kind are known which date back to more than
four thousand years before Christ. These countries were so poor in
rocks that all their structures were built of brick.

Ceramics were still in their infancy when designs and symbolic
signs were employed for decoration. Everyone is familiar with the
geometrical designs, the crossed, dotted, or concentric lines which
ornament prehistoric pottery.’ The ceramics discovered at Hissarlik
and Mycene present strange decorations; one finds colored and
concave designs, swastikas, and inscriptions in archaic characters

In Grecian antiquity fragments of pottery were utilized as ma-

tions explanatory of the figures.

METALS.

It can not be demonstrated that iron never received engraved
inscriptions in antiquity. The great decomposition which this metal
must have suffered under the influence of the oxygen of the atmos-
phere and the earth is the only reason why none has come down to us.

series of exploits.*| In Rome the use of columns and of tablets of
bronze for inscribing laws followed that of wood. We find in all the
museums of Europe inscriptions upon metals (fig. 23). One of the
most remarkable is the famous bronze tablet preserved in the Museum
of Lyons, containing the address delivered in the year 48 by the
Emperor Claudius.’

Lead beaten thin and reduced to leaves served the same purpose.
Job laments his inability to write a discourse upon sheets of lead. In
Greece lead thus prepared was quite frequently used. Suetonius
terms these leaves of lead plumbea charta;° tablets were also made
of it, which were employed all through the Middle Ages.

It seems unnecessary to cite coins and medals. They always bore
a legend, either symbolic or explained by letters.

WOOD, BARK, LEAVES.

Wood as a material used to engrave and write upon is perhaps more
ancient than stone, but there is no trace of it left from the prehis-
toric period. It was split into thin boards, upon which were traced
in different colored inks the characters of the language. The Egyp-
tians must have proceeded in this manner, if one may judge by a syca-
more board discovered in 1887 in the third pyramid of Memphis,
which, according to the Egyptologists, dates back more than five
thousand years.

The ancient laws of Solon and of Draco were likewise traced upon
wooden tables. They were called “ axones.” These tables joined in
the shape of quadrangular prisms and crossed by an axis, were first
set up perpendicularly in the citadel, where, revolving by the slight-

est effort, they presented successively the entire code of laws to the
eyes of the beholders. (F rg. 24.)¢

In Rome the laws were written upon boards of oak, which were
exhibited in the Forum. The word * album” probably originated in
the Roman custom of inscribing in black ink upon tablets of wood,
painted white, their annals or daily happenings.”

St. Jerome informs us also that small boards and cubes of wood
were employed to engrave the alphabet upon, to teach the children to
read.

The tablets in use among the Romans and throughout the middle
ages were made of wood. They were likewise made of lead, ivory,

parchment, and even of the bark of trees. In the time of the poet
Fortunatus not only were tablets of ash used, but small, smooth rods
as well.¢

The Egyptians observed the custom of putting “ tablai” (fig. 25)4

upon their coffins. These tablets contained the names and attributes
of the deceased person. All that have thus far been collected seem
to date from the Roman occupation, since the inscriptions are in
Greek.

Shavings of wood, taken off by the plane, were also utilized.
Theophrastus cites an example of it,¢ and Pancirot says that the
Lombards joined these shavings by means of glue and thus manufac-
tured a sort of paper.” The idea of writing on wocd is not lost in
eur days. Entire books are written on (tastes of wood resembling
thin veneer. Visiting cards of wood are sometimes seen. In China
paper and envelopes are used where the paper is exceedingly thin
and is covered with a pellicle of wood. The school primers of the
East—Algeria, Turkey, and other Moslem regions—are made of
small boards (pl. iv), recalling in form the Egyptian tablai, upon
which the letters or sentences from the Koran are written. The
inscriptions, which are so curious, but which have not yet been de-
ciphered, discovered on Easter Island, are engraved upon wood.
Wood is even at the present day employed in China for engraving
characters in relief, which are subsequently printed. Our xylo-
graphic plates of the fifteenth century were also of wood.

Finally, wood is still employed to make blackboards, in use in

schools.

In the remotest times the ancients used the outer bark of trees for
writing, but the numerous inequalities and the frequently great
fragility of the bark caused it to be abandoned, with the exception
of that of the cherry, the linden, and the birch. They sought to
utilize the inner bark, or liber, of the tree, and employed by prefer-
ence that of the pine, the fir, and the linden.“ The Greeks and the
Romans wrote extensive works upon the prepared bark of trees.

The leaves of trees have also been used. The Syracusans voted by
writing on olive leaves, whence the word petalism, a synonym of
ostracism.’ The leaves of several other trees, among them the mal-
low, contributed to the same purpose. A sort of tissue was made
from the leaves of a certain palm.

In Persia, a great part of Asia, India, Indo-China, China, Borneo,
Sumatra, even in Oceania, prepared leaves of trees, particularly
of certain palms, were and are still made use of. In Malaysia they
use the leaves of cabbage palms, dried, polished, or covered with a
brilliant or gilt varnish; it is after these successive preparations
that they trace the characters with a pencil or engrave them with a
very fine point. Certain books, formed thus, resemble a good deal
the slats of our Venetian blinds, opening and closing in the same
manner. In the Maldives they use the leaf of the makarekau,
which has a breadth of 1 foot and a roe of 3 feet.4

LINEN AN) OTHER TEXTILES.

It was natural enough that textiles should be used for the tracing of
characters with a pencil or calamite. Their flexibility and the facility
of preserving them adapted them to it. Most of the “ books of the
dead ” which the Egyptians placed in the sarcophagi were written
upon linen. In Greece, Italy, Rome, and the Orient textiles served
the same purpose. The Samnites had a ritual written in that
manner, which served to regulate the order of the sacrifices before
engaging in a war.

At Rome the land records preserved among the archives were
written upon linen year by year and kept in the temple of Moneta
at the capital, as well as the libri lintei, a list of the magistrates.
Textiles were used even for transcribing literary works. Martianus
Capella designates them under the name of carbasina volumina.
Sidonius Apollinaris wrote his poems upon pieces of linen. During
the middle ages this custom still continued, for an abbot recom-
mends his monks to copy the works of St. Anastasius upon their
clothes in case paper should be lacking.” In the Orient silk was
utilized for the same purpose. “ In France,” says Géraud, “ up to
the last century, it was the practice in the universities to have those
copies of a thesis which were intended for personages of importance
printed on satin.¢

We have spoken incidentally of tablets; they were made of wood,
lead, ivory, and even parchment, and, excepting those of lead, were
coated with wax, and written upon with a point or stylus... To
preserve them, they were placed together and tied into bundles. | In
order that the writing should not be obliterated under pressure or by
rubbing, the edges of the tablet had a slight projection to which the
wax flowed; so that the engraved characters were not effaced when
the tablets were pressed together. Later the tablets formed a dip-
tych; that is to say, they were composed of two tablets united by a
hinge. Closed, they presented two surfaces, plain or ornamented,
but without writing; open, one could write upon both of the wax-
covered inner surfaces.

LEATHER, VARIOUS KINDS OF SKIN, PARCHMENT.

With the advent of skins we enter upon a period in which writing
becomes a more common practice; documents multipiy, works of the
imagination and historical annals assume a new form. It is no longer
tradition alone which transmits poems, legends, and recollections. By

the use of skin and its various preparations, manuscripts are recopied
and circulate among all classes of ancient society.

For a long time skins rudely prepared, scarcely tanned, were used
for writing. We know through documents that the Egyptians em-
ployed them two thousand years before our era; the Assyrian monu-
ments depict seribes writing on scrolls. The Persians recorded their
annals upon hides, while the Tonians prepared for the same purpose
the skin of the sheep and the goat. According to biblical texts, the
Hebrews were accustomed to the use of skins, and copied their law
upon rolls of leather“ (pl. v). “ There is preserved,” says Lalanne,”

cloak. In certain islands of Polynesia, and particularly in. New
Zealand, the tattooing of the men was governed by the brilliancy of
their deeds. The designs, which covered the face and the body, repre-
sented symbolically a description of events. Even the human skin
has incidentally been used to write upon. Between tanned skin and
parchment there was but a brief interval. In order to diminish the
weight of the leather, man first had to thin it. Then he tried to
bleach it—hence the origin of parchment. It is possible that it was
at Pergamus the improvement was made. They must have manu-
factured it and dealt in it there, since the product derives its name
from that place. It is believed that it was known fifteen centuries
before the present era.

The skin of the goat, the sheep, and the ass was prepared by
methods nearly identical with those of our own day." The first pro-
duections of parchment were so defective that they were only used to
cover books made of papyrus and tablets and for labels. It is
only toward the fifth century before our era that the practice of
writing on parchment became general. As its preparation improved
its use spread more and more. After the eleventh century this
material entirely supplanted papyrus, which had become rare and
poor. We know that books of importance, manuscript and printed,
are composed of parchment. Up to the eighteenth century it was
always used for royal acts and private transactions.

PAPYRUS.

It is from the stem of the Cyperus papyrus (paper rush) that
according to Baillon, paper was manufactured. This rush, a native
of Egypt, it is said, was very abundant up to the middle ages, but
it has become rare and is not met with except on the marshy banks
of streams in the far south. The root, as thick as a man’s arm,
spreads out horizontally, the stalks rise from it at right angles to
a height of from 7 to 10 cubits ’—that is, about 3.6 to 4.5 meters.
The slender stem, tenuous, triangular almost through its entire
length, is terminated by an umbel composed of green filaments,
producing a most beautiful effect. But it is not in Egypt only that
the papyrus was found, it grew in Sicily, Spain, the southern part
of France, as far up as Avignon, in the shallows of the Rhone,’ as
well as in the greater part of the streams of Africa and Madagascar.“

6 The Greek cubit varied from city to city; its average length was 0.43 centi-
meters.

bridge which leads from Avignon to the island of Barthelasse. °

654 MATERIALS TO WRITE UPON BEFORE INVENTION OF PRINTING.

The use of the plant was not confined to making paper. The
root served for fuel. From the fibers of the stalk, dried and plaited,
rope was manufactured. The roofs of houses were also covered with
them. In case of famine the lower part of the stem was used for
food, although its nutritive value is very slight. The stems, cut
and joined together, served to make hght rafts.

The coarsest part of the papyrus was employed to make sails for
boats or a material which the poor used for clothing.

The most ancient Egyptian texts on papyrus extant date back to
3580-3536 before our era.” Theophrastus speaks of it in his treatise
on plants. Pliny copied this in part, but not altogether faithfully.
The work of Pliny, however, possesses merit in a different direction.
It is to him we owe the description of the manufacture of paper.
Numerous writers have taken up Pliny’s text, translating it, inter-
preting it, and even trying to manufacture paper.° Stodhart alone
seemed to have been succeeding in his attempt, when, unfortunately,
death interrupted his researches.?. A bit of papyrus of his manufac-
ture is preserved in the brary of the French Institute. Dureau de
la Malle published a long memoir on this manufacture. He com-
plains of the obscurity of Pliny’s text, in which opinion he is con-

The following seems to have been the method in manufacturing
paper from papyrus:

The stalk, shortened at the top and base, was split by a sharp point
through its entire length into very fine strips. This operation was
generally begun in the center, and the first two central strips were
reserved for the manufacture of paper of a superior quality. The
succeeding layers were reserved for the manufacture of paper of an
inferior quality. The two outside strips, composed almost exclusively
of bark, had to be rejected. There is no question, as some writers
have suggested, of the use of the bark; 1t was much too thin, com-
posed, like most of the monocotyledons, of cells of compact tissue,
filled with chlorophyl and perhaps with some traces of silica.

These slips (¢Avpy, philyre) were laid together side by side
upon an inclined table, whose surface was plentifully moistened, so
that the slips adhered to each other. According to Pliny, they were
dampened with Nile water, which alone could dilute the viscous
liquid of the crushed cells, necessary to cause the lamellae to adhere to
ach other.”

The layer formed by these slips was termed “ scheda.” On top of
the scheda a new layer of slips was placed, crossing those of the
lower one; thus a sheet, or plagula, was produced whose diameter
in each direction was equal to the length of a philyra. When it was
sufficiently desiccated, the plagula
was squeezed in a press, which con-
tracted every part of it; then it was
exposed to the sun to dry.

A number of plagule, from 10 to
20, according to the period, were
jomed together, then they were
rolled, and a quire, or scapus, was
formed of it.

The quality of the papyrus ob-
tained varied according to the width
of the first cuts or philyre. The
best quality was called hieratic,

was the Livian, the amphitheatric,

The discovery of paper assured to the “* book ” an indefinite vital-
ity and expansion. The material par excellence had, in fact, been
found, indestructible material, which allows the book to be more
phable, less heavy, to pass down the ages as well, if not better, than
papyrus and parchment.

and twenty-three years before our era, that the invention of paper is
due. Whether it was in consequence of cordial relations or through
Chinese prisoners that paper was introduced in Samareand is of
iittle importance; the fact is certain that it did become known there
in 751. Forty-three years later paper was known at Bagdad and at
Damascus. Its employment and manufacture spread rapidly in
Syria, Arabia, Egypt.

Doctor Karabacek had the good fortune to recover, among the
treasures of KE] Uschmunein, all the secrets of Egyptian paper
makers. He even discovered bills, or receipts of imposts, dating
from 950 to 1036 of our era. This paper is sometimes very thin and
often highly glazed.

In the twelfth century paper mills were established in Fez, Mo-
rocco, and in Xativa, Spain, whence they spread to Valencia and
other cities.

In Italy paper mills existed at Fabriano from the thirteenth cen-
tury. The collection of Prof. A. Zonghi comprises several thousand
samples of paper from that locality, dating from 1267 to 1750. He
even had the patience to raise the filigrees from these papers, and his
manuscript album contains more than 20,000 designs.’ According to
a charter of the bishop of Lodeéve, granted in 1189 to Raymond de
Popian, a paper mill was to be erected at that date in Herault, but
this document could not be found. It is only cited in the chronology
of the bishops of Lodeve. Some reservation must therefore be made.

This is not the case with another document found in the cartulary
of the monasteries of Gellone and Aniane, published by Meynial and
the Abbé Cassan. It is beyond doubt, according to this record, that
paper was known in France in 1346.¢

Its introduction into Europe seems to coincide with the exodus of
the Jews to Spain and the south of France after the Arabs had ex-
pelled them first from the north of Africa and later from the south of
Spain.

cf the fourteenth century. Ulmann Streemer had established him-
self at Ulm. Born in 1328, he died in 1407. He has left memoirs in
which he recounts his annoyances*with some of his workmen.*

Mentel, a contemporary of Gutenberg (1400-1478), established a
paper factory at Strasburg.

John Tate is the first paper maker in England. After him must
be mentioned Spielmann, of German origin, jeweler to Queen Eliza-
beth. He was created a knight and obtained for a term of ten years
the exclusive privilege of collecting all the rags required for his mill.?

In the beginning, paper was manufactured in a mold—that is to
say, the workmen drew directly from the vat of paste a certain quan-
tity of it, and, by a particular twist of the hand, he spread it over ¢
frame, whose under side was formed of brass wires (wire cloth)
stretched, and pressed against each other, and kept rigid by other
metallic threads (cross rods) somewhat stronger, aiid placed across
the first. The whole process of manufacturing paper is too familiar
to require anything further to be said regarding it.

Until recently the opinion of scholars and of all those who had
studied the composition and the manufacture of paper was that the
first products of that industry were made from cotton. The name
itself under which paper was designated in Latin and Greek seemed
to demonstrate this: Charta bombyeina, cuttunea, damascena,
yaeuns bOMbANXL V OS.

Numerous dissertations, erudite enough, but all equally inaccurate,
attempted to prove the existence of cotton paper.° All the proofs in
favor of this method, based solely on the outside and superficial
appearance of the paper, and on the texts containing vague defini-
tions, vanished as soon as a really scientific analysis and examination
of paper was made. Wiesner and Briquet were the first to examine
paper with the microscope; the latter has recorded in the Mémoires
de la Société des Antiquaries de France (5° série, Tome VI*, 1885)
i result of a microscopic analysis of 122 specimens of paper from
the most varied sources, and embracing a period extending from the
eleventh to the fifteenth century.

The following is the résumé of his conclusions:

There has never been any cotton paper.

658 MATERIALS TO WRITE UPON BEFORE INVENTION OF PRINTING.

Rag paper is more ancient than has been supposed. It goes back
to the tenth century.

Rag paper was first used in the Orient. It did not penetrate into
the Occident until two or three centuries later.

Paper was filigreed from the thirteenth century in the Occident.
This practice was transported later to the Orient.?

It is certain that in China from the very origin of the discovery of
paper, bamboo must have been used in its manufacture. Other vege-
table materials may have contributed to the same use. The Japanese
paper which we know is manufactured from the bark of certain small
trees, Edgewortia papyrifera, Broussonetia papyrifera, and Wik-
stroemia canescens.

A longer digression upon this subject would carry us beyond cur
projected limits. With the discovery of printing we must stop.

We may conclude by saying that man, inspired by the desire of
leaving traces of his hfe and actions, sought every means to transmit
them to his descendants. What an evolution he has passed through
from the pictographic inscriptions upon the rocks to the phonetic
alphabet written on paper and finally printed.

AN INQUIRY INTO THE POPULATION OF CHINA.

By WILLIAM WOoopbvVILLE ROCKHILL.

iis

From the earliest times of their history the Chinese have made
every few years enumerations of the adult population of the Empire.
The history of the census in China may be divided into two parts.
During the first, extending from the first recorded count in’ the
twenty-third century B. C. down to 1712 A D., with a few excep-
tions, the number of tax-paying households alone was recorded. In
the second period the total number of individuals is purpesed to have
been taken.

In the first period the census was made solely for the purpose of
levying the taxes, and there is every reason to believe that the local
officials systematically kept the returns forward to the central Gov-
ernment below the real figures, so as to divert to their own use as
much of the taxes levied as they possibly could. In the second period,
that reason no longer existing (see infra, p. 663), it became a matter
of pride with the officials, as well as good policy, to swell the returns
of population.

There is much uncertainty as to the number of individuals con-
tained in each recorded * household ” or hu, and whether by the word
“individual” (literally “mouth,” k’ou) is to be understood male
adults, or both sexes, or persons of all ages—exclusive of infants—
who have never been included in the enumerations of any period. In
the time of Mencius (fourth century B. C.) the “ family” (chia)
Was supposed to comprise eight months (k’ou). This was the num-
ber of persons whom 100 mou (about 15 acres) of medium land were

seem that the “ household ” comprised from 4.8 to 5.2 individuals;
in others, the T’ang, for example, it rose to 5.8. During others, as the
Sung, it was only a fraction over 2 persons, according to Sacharoft,
though Biot ’ contends that in this period it was a fraction more than
‘ persons, as in the preceding period of the T’ang. Under the Yuan
dynasty, according to Amiot, the “ household ” comprised 5 persons,
and in the succeeding Ming dynasty it seems to have varied from
about 5 to over 6.6. Even during the present dynasty we are in grave
doubt as to the numeric value of the term hu (“ household,” “ fam-
ily”). Father Amiot and other foreign writers have thought it rep-
resented 5 persons, de Guignes* says 2 to 8, but in the opinion of
E. H. Parker it averaged 6 persons.?. In the census of 1842, which
gave the number of households and of individuals, the former aver-
aged 2.3 persons to the family; and in a census of the city of Peking
for 1846 it averaged 3.1. I am disposed to accept 4 as a fair figure
for enumerations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.°

During the Han dynasty, from A. D. 1 to 156, we have 10 enumer-
ations.’ The first, taken in A. D.1, gave 12,233,062 “households” and
59,594,978 “individuals.” The last, taken in 156, gave 16,070,906
“ households ” and only 50,066,856 “ individuals.” The territory over
which these censuses extended did not vary appreciably during the
whole of this period of one hundred and fifty-five years; it was sub-
stantially the same as at the present day. The population during this
century and a half was nearly stationary.

In A. D. 606, when China was again united under one rule, what
has been held by western writers to be a very careful census was
taken. It again gave the population of the Empire at about 55,-
500,000.29

During the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries, although a consid-
erable number of enumerations of the people are recorded, they are
so confused that it is impossible to fix with more than the roughest
approximation the population at that time of China proper, which

d See infra, pp. 663-664. In Japan the average number of persons by house-
hold, which often includes several families, was 5.55 at the close of 1898.

elt is true that in the case of the prefecture of Wen-chou, in Che-kiang, it
was found in 1881 that the average number of persons per home was about 5.14
(see infra, p. 314), and in the case of Ch’ung-k’ing in Sst-ch’uan in 1877 a
detailed census of the city gave about -£.5 persons to a family (Hz. C. Baber,
Journ. of Explor. in west. China, p. 25).

then covered about the same area as at present. The census which
appears to have been the most carefully made was that of the year
756. It gave 8,814,708 families and 52,919,309 individuals for the
free population, exclusive of infants and very old people; it included
the kingdom of Korea. The total population in A, D. 756 may there-
fore have been about 61,000,000. Biot, using the censuses referred
to in this paragraph, has calculated the average yearly increase of
the population of Chian proper between A. D. 650 and 755, and found
it to have been about 0.0063 per cent.

During the eleventh century, when the Empire was again united
under the rule of the Sung, we have ten enumerations of the popula-
tion, that of the year 1080 showing evidence of having been the most
carefully taken. It gives the number of households of freeholders
(chu) and tenants (k’o) as 14,852,686, or 33,303,889 individuals. No
matter how numerous we allow the exempted and unenumerated classes
to have been, it is not conceivable that they could have more than
doubled this number; so we may, I think, safely assume that at the
end of the eleventh century the population of China proper was not
much more than 60,000,000, the same as in the middle of the eighth
century.

Biot has calculated the average yearly increase during the Sung
dynasty (A. D. 976 to 1102) and found that from 976 to 1021 it was
about 9.02 per cent, and from 1021 to 1102 only 0.0103 per cent, or
0.015 per cent during these one hundred and twenty-five years.

In 1290, at the end of the Mongol conquest of China by Kublai
Khan, a census of China proper gave 13,196,206 households of 58,-
834,711 individuals. Admitting that vast numbers of Chinese had
been reduced to slavery by the Mongols and countless thousands had
been killed, the population at the end of the thirteenth century can
hardly have been much in excess of 75,000,000.

During the Ming dynasty there were no fewer than 21 censuses
between 1381 and 1578. The highest figure of the recorded popula-
tion during this period was 66,598,337 individuals in 1403, and the
lowest 46,802,005 in 1506. The last census, that of 1578, taken at a
time when the country was extremely prosperous and enjoying gen-
eral peace, gave the populaticn as 63,599,541 souls. .

While agreeing with Sacharoff that the various censuses of this
period are not of a trustworthy character, I beheve they may be
considered sufficiently accurate to show that during the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries the population of China increased very slowly,
certainly not more rapidly than during previous periods of its
history.

Between the founding of the present Manchu dynasty (A. D.
1644) and 1734 we have enumerations of the population by house-
holds for nearly every year. E. H. Parker has extracted them from
the Tung hua lu for the years between 1651 and 1860.¢ From 1651
to 1730 they are as follows for every tenth year:

4It is interesting to note that nearly all European writers of the latter part
of the sixteenth and of the seventeenth centuries, such as Trigault, Matteo
Ricci, Nerrada, Martin Martini, Semedo, Mandelslo, and Osbeck, give approxi-
mately the figure of the census of 1578 as that of the population of China in
their time, some of them stating that it included only adult males or * fighting
men.” I can find no authority for this in any Chinese work. Gemelli Careri
(Voy. Round the World, Pt. IV, 826) made out the population of China at the
end of the seventeenth century to be 59,788,364 men, “exclusive of women.
children, paupers, Officials, literati, army, the imperial clan, ete.’ He gives the
number of families as 11,502,872. The figures, both of individuals and of house-
holds, are substantially those of the census of 1578. He cites no authority for
his statement concerning Classes of the population not included in the census.
I am inciined to believe he took his figures and this statement bodily from
Athanasius Kircher or Father Martin Martini, but they in turn furnish no
authority for their belief that the recorded population was exclusively composed
of male adults,

Statistical Society, XII, pt. 1, pp. 150-156. Du Halde, Description, ete, II,

the taxpayers were the adult males only between twenty and sixty years of age.

Tn the case of the census of 1720 we are told that there were, exclu-
sive of the taxed population, 309,545 famihes free from taxation,
and 851,959 families in the case of that of 1730. Parker notes that
“evidence clearly shows” (but, as usual with him, he does not go to
the trouble of giving any) “that the numbers given above must be
multiphed by six, and not by five, as was done by Amiuot, in order to
obtain the number of individuals.” Pending production of evidence,
T shall follow Father Amiot’s views on this point, and would add 2
per cent for the tax-free famihes, which include officials, literati, the
army, ete. On this basis we find that the total population of China
proper in 1651, during the troublous times which accompanied the
establishment of Manchu supremacy, was about 55,000,000—just
about the number we should have assumed it to be had we to deduct
it from the data supplied by history alone. From 1651 down to the
present time the figures of the returns vary with such extraordinary
rapidity, so unlike anything we have noted in the whole long list of
sarlier Chinese enumerations, that one is inevitably brought to look
on them as fanciful and probably far remote from the truth.”

In 1712 an imperial edict ordered that the number of families
(24,621,334) given in the enumeration of the preceding year should
remain the invariable basis for the assessment of the crown taxes, -
and that all subsequent censuses should give the total number of
inhabitants. Nevertheless, it was only in 1741, after repeated orders
had been given by the Imperial Government, that a return was made
of the total population of China. According to it the population
was 143,412,000. For 1743 we find in the Institutes of the Ta
Ch’ing dynasty (Ta Ch’ing Hui-tien) a detailed census of the seven-
teen provinces—corresponding to the eighteen of the present day—
but again given by households. This census gave the total number
of households (hu) as 28,877,364, comprising 143,621,460 individ-
uals, or about 4.8 persons to a household. To this number, which

aDe Guignes (Voyage a Peking, Vol. III, pp. 56-86), after a study of the
Chinese census returns of 1748, 1761, and 1794, concluded that they were exag-

gerated, and also that the figure five adopted by the missionaries to ascertain
the number of persons in a family was too high by half. He calculated the
population of China proper in L789 at 150,000,000 as a maximum,

corresponds very closely with that given for 1741, Amiot would add
493,075 individuals for unenumerated officials, 2,470,000 for the
literati, and 4,115,325 for the army. To this again he would add
some 50,000,000 for the civil employees of Government, the monks,
nuns, brigands, vagabonds, troglodytes, ete., with which, he says,
China is full. Here I think he is unquestionably wrong, for the
civil employees were included either in the already accounted for
class of officials, or in the general returns,* while as for monks, nuns,
etc., the number was unquestionably so small that it may be omitted
in such a rough estimate as that we are attempting to reach. We
may adopt the number 148,000,000 individuals as a maxmum for the
total population of China proper in 1748.

The various estimates of the population made by the Government
of China since 1743 are contained in the following table, in which
have also been included the annual rates of increase or decrease
between succeeding dates deducted from them:

«The figures for 1850 and 1860 are given on the authority of the Tung hue lu. ‘The
data from which the figure for 1885 is deduced were supplied me in 1885 by the Chinese
board of revenue Hu Pu, and supplemented and completed by figures supplied by the
same board to Mr. Popoft for ten provinces for the year 1879. ‘This enumeration, as also
those for 1761, 1812, 1842, and 1882 are given in detail, infra, p. 676. See also S. Wells

Since the last date in the preceding table a number of estimates of
the population of China proper have been made by various writers,
but none of the estimates has any particular value, all of them being
based on the data supplied Popoff for 1879 and 1882. E. H. Par-

inces yor 1894; this is the wildest guess yet made, and foots up a
total of 421,800,000. In.1903 the Statesman’s Year Book (p. 506)
published a table “issued by the Chinese Government as the results
of a census taken for the purpose of the apportionment of the
indemnity to the powers,” in which the population is estimated at
407,253,000. ‘There is not a scintilla of evidence to show that any
census was taken for the purpose stated, and, furthermore, there
was no necessity for taking one, as the sums levied from the various
provinces for the indemnity of 1900 were procured by indirect
taxation. Here again we have nothing more than a guess of the
Chinese beard of revenue.

EE

An attempt will now be made to determine the value of the vari-
ous enumerations of population since that of 1741, which IT am
inclined to beheve was probably a closer approximation to the truth
than were any subsequent ones, the Imperial Government being in
strong, intelligent hands, its mandates executed with more faithful-
ness and precision than at any other subsequent period, and the Empire
enjoying perfect peace. I feel confident, however, that it was in
excess of the truth, for it must be borne in mind that no census
such as we make in this country has ever been attempted in China.
The statutes of the Empire” require, it is true, that all families
should make returns of their members, and impose punishments
for failure to comply or for falsification of returns; it would there-
fore seem easy to tabulate these returns at any time, but experience
has proved that such is not the case. In China all statements of
population are largely guesswork, and where numbers are guessed
they are always magnified, especially when there is no reason to
keep them down, as was the case prior to the imperial edict of
1712, referred to previously.

China enjoys a salubrious chmate and a fertile soil, and the people
have always been extraordinarly industrious and thrifty. As a gen-
eral rule the taxation has been fairly equable, and life and property
safe in times of peace. These conditions are all conducive to a large
increase in population. There is another reason which should from
the remotest times have been potent in producing a larger increase
of population in China than in other countries enjoying like nat-
ural advantages. I refer to the desire of every Chinese to have pos-
terity to keep up the ancestral worship. We find Mencius (B. C.
372-289) saying: “ There are three unfilial acts, and to have no pos-
terity is the greatest of them” (pu hsiao yu san, wu hou wei ta).?

‘ailure to support one’s parents enduring poverty is only second to
it, for by failing to have posterity one offends against the whole line
of one’s ancestors by putting an end to the sacrifices due them. To
this belief is due the universal practice of early marriages which has
always prevailed in China.

The exceptional checks we find to a large increase of the popula-
tion are, however, quite as potent as the encouragements to its
increase just mentioned. Among these, famine, floods, and_pesti-
lence have been the most constantly operating, and have arrested
rapid increase more even than the losses incurred through the fearful
butcheries which have throughout China’s history invariably accom-
pamed the suppression of every rebellion, the establishment of
every new dynasty.

Alexander Hosie in his paper on * Droughts in China from A. D.
620 to 1643,” or during a period of one thousand and twenty-three
years, found that drought had occured in five hundred and eighty-
three years in some one of the eighteen provinces, frequently in four
or five of them at the same time, and in many cases they were accom-

ch’eng (see Journ. Ch. Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc, n. s., XII, 51 et seq.), may be sum-
marized as follows:

Between A. D. 620 and 700 inclusive, there were 41 years with droughts, of
which 2 were the results of great floods.

From 701 to SOO, inclusive, there were 46 years with drought. In 790 typhus
ranged.

From 801 to 900, inclusive, there were 48 years with drought, 8 of which were
of great severity.

From 901 to 1000, inclusive, there were 60 years with drought, 18 being “ great
droughts.”

From 1001 to 1100, inclusive, there were 68 years with drought, 6 being of
long duration, S “great droughts” and one (1086-87) universal and of long
duration.

From 1101 to 1200, inclusive, there are 60 recorded droughts, of which 9
were “ great droughts,” 4 of long duration and 5 “ very severe.”

From 1201 to 1300, inclusive, there were 76 droughts, of which 12 were “* great
droughts ” and 4 ‘ very severe.”

From 1301 to 1400, inclusive, there were 59 years with drought, of which 25
were “ great droughts,” 4 accompanied with floods in other sections of the coun-
try, 4 with locusts, and during 6 of the droughts the people resorted to
cannibalism.

From 1401 to 1500, inclusive, there were 57 years with drought, of which 56
were “great droughts; during 8 cannibalism is recorded, and during several
typhus raged.

From 1501 to 1600 there were 84 years with drought, of which 69 were
droughts” (in A. D. 1568 it extended over 8 provinces) ; during several can-

“ great
nibalism is recorded.

From 1601 to 1643, there were 15 years with drought. In 15 years it occurred
in Shan-hsi and in 11 in Che-kiang.
INQUIRY INTO THE POPULATION OF CHINA. 667

panied by floods, typhus, and other scourges. Frequently these
droughts lasted in the same section of country for several successive
vears or occurred at such close intervals that the country had not
time to recover from them. To cite but two cases: from A. D. 1601
to 1643 drought is recorded in some one province of China in thirty
years, in fifteen of which it occurred in the province of Shan-hsi, and
in eleven in that of Che-kiang.

The fearful loss of life which has marked every calamity that has
visited any part of China, and the nearly incredible cruelty which has
been shown in the suppression of every uprising that has taken place
from the earliest days down to the present time, are unfortunately
too well authenticated to be denied.

Without going back to the early annals of the Chinese for examples
of the terrible mortality which has always attended natural calamities
and warfare in China, a few in the last three centuries, vouched for
by reliable European writers, or by foreigners resident in the country
at the time of their occurrence, may be cited here.

Father Du Halde®¢ states that in the year 1582 “ there was such a
great drought in the Province of Shan-hsi, that it was impossible to
count the number of those who died of starvation. There were dug
in various localities some sixty great ditches, each of which held a
thousand corpses, and were thereafter called Van gin keng.” (Wan
jen k’éng), “ Grave of a myriad men.”

The same author” says that on September 2, 1678, there was an
varthquake in the Province of Chih-h when over 30,000 persons lost
their lives in the town of T’ung-chou alone. On November 30, 1731,
there was another earthquake in the same province, when over 100,-
000 persons lost their lives in Peking, and more than that number in
the adjacent country.

Father Amiot,? writing from Peking, May 20, 1786, tells of a
terrible drought which for the three past years had visited the prov-
inces of Kiang-nan, Ho-nan, and Shan-tung. The people in vast num-
bers sought to reach other provinces, but thousands upon thousands
died on the roads and their corpses were devoured by the survivors.

As regards the extraordinary loss of life attending military opera-
tions in China, Du Halde states ¢@ that in 1635 the Chinese, to defend
the city of K’ai-feng Fu in Ho-nan against the rebels, cut the Yellow
River dikes. The whole city was submerged and 300,000 persons lost
their lives.

668 INQUIRY INTO THE POPULATION OF CHINA.

The history of Clh’ang Hsien-chung, told by Du Halde,* by Father
dOrelans,’ by Father de Mailla,’ and others, is an example of what
has frequently occurred in China during its long history. In the
disturbed period which followed the overthrow of the Ming dynasty
this person overran with his troops the provinces of Ho-nan, Kiang-
nan, Kiang-hsi, and Sst-ch’uan. It is said that for the slightest
offense not only was the offender himself put to death, but the same
punishment was visited on all the inhabitants of the same street.
Five thousand eunuchs were beheaded because one of their number
refused to treat him as Emperor. He called some 10,000 students
to the examinations at Ch’éng-tu Fu in Sst-ch’uan and had them all
put to death. He had butchered over 600,000 persons in that prov-
ince alone! On leaving Ch’éng-tu to march into the adjoining
province of Shen-hsi he had all the inhabitants chained, led out of
the city, and executed. Then he ordered his soldiers to put to death
their own wives as troublesome impediments in times of war, and
he gave the example by having his own wives executed. So reads
his story. If it is not all true much of it certainly is.

Turning to the nineteenth century, always on the authority of care-
ful European investigators, Colonel Kuropatkin (the present com-
mander in chief of the Russian army in Manchuria) speaking ? of the
Mohammedan rebellion in Shen-hsi and Kan-su of 1861 and subse-
quent years, states, on the authority of Sosnovski, that on the ocea-
sion of the siege of Ho-chou in Kan-su, which lasted seven months,
20,000 men were put to death by the Chinese on the fall of that place.
When the neighboring town of Hsi-ning Fu was captured, 9,000 were
put to death. At the capture of Chin-chi P’u, the Mohammedan
stronghold, 50,000 were killed and a vast fruitful and thickly popu-
lated tract turned into waste. At Chuguchak and its environs 40,000
men perished at the hands of the Chinese, and the town was left
without a single inhabitant.

Doctor Macgowan, who was residing in China during the whole
of the T’ai-p’ing rebellion, says of it:¢ ‘“ Nine provinces had been
desolated by it; flourishing towns and cities had been made heaps of
ruins, and wild beasts made their dens within them, whilst fully
thirty millions of people had been put to death by these ruthless rob-
bers ” (rebels and imperialists).

Another authority says: “ During the first year of the great Tai-
ping rebellion the registered population declined by two-fifths, but

though many millions must have perished, it is not at all likely that
the numbers of 1850 (4147493,000) were more than decimated. Even
then, to kill or starve 48,000,000 people in ten years would mean
12,000 a day, in addition to the 40,000 a day who (at the rate of 30
per thousand per annum) would die naturally, and would balance
about the same number of births. Moreover, the rebellion covered
only one-half the area of China, so that 24,000 a day is certainly
nearer than 12,000."

The loss of life attending the crushing of the two Mohammedan
and the Nien-fei rebellions (1860-1875) mounted certainly to over a
million. Then we have a quarter of a million killed in the suppres-
sion of the Mohammedan rebellion in Kan-su in 1894-95. If we
add to this terrible source of loss of population that resulting from
famines and floods, the total is nearly doubled. There were great
famines in 1810, 1811, 1546, and 1849, which, according to the
Tung hua lu, the best official authority we have on the subject, re-
duced the population by 45,000,000. Although this figure may seem
excessive, we know that in the next great famine, that of 1877-78,
which visited only four provinces of the Empire with great severity,
no fewer than 9,500,000 persons fell its victims. This figure I quote
on the authority of the China famine relief committee of Shanghai.

We must add to this again the loss of life which attended the great
flood of 1888, when the Yellow River broke its banks and flooded
nearly the whole province of Ho-nan. According to memorials sent
at the time to the Emperor, about 2,000,000 were drowned or starved
to death by this catastrophe. Then there is the unknown, but cer-
tainly terrible, mortality during the great drought and famine in
Shan-hsi, Shen-hsi, Chih-h, and southern Mongolia in 1892-93 and
i894. There have also been numerous epidemics of cholera and
plague which have devastated sections of the Empire in the last
twenty to thirty years, and still we have not exhausted the Lst of
‘auses of violent fluctuations, of extraordinary loss to the population
of China during the nineteenth century.”

It must not be lost sight of that these figures represent only the
mortality among adults; it is extremely improbable that infants were
counted at all.

Popoff, in his study on the population in China,° estimates that the

a). H. Parker, China, p. 190.

bT was told in 1901 by the late Li lung Chang that over 80,000 Chinese lost
their lives in Peking alone during the Boxer troubles of 19980. Admitting that
this figure and all those here given are exaggerated, it is true beyond all doubt
that the loss to the population from these causes has been fearful.

¢P. S. Popoff in Novoe Vremya, No. 3066, September 10, 1884. Conf. S. Wells
Williams, The Middle Kingdom, 1, 270,
670 INQUIRY INTO THE POPULATION OF CHINA.

population of China proper has not only not increased during the
period of forty years, from 1842 to 1882, but has even diminished by the
considerable number of 30,942,592.

The only reliable data I have found on the subject of Chinese vital
statistics are the following:

In 1880 the governor of the province of Che-kiang reported“ to
the Emperor that as the result of a general census of the province
taken in 1879 it was found that the population was 11,541,054.

Mr. Popoff, the interpreter of the Russian legation in China, was
informed in 1882 by the board of revenue in Peking that the
population of this same province of Che-kiang was then 11,588,692,
and in 1885 the same board informed the writer of the present paper
that it was then 11,684,348.

As corroborative evidence of the value of these figures, we learn
that Commissioner of Customs Alfred E. Hippisley’ found by a
careful report made to him by the taotai of the prefecture of Wen-
chou that the average number of persons per home was about 5.14,
and that the total population of the prefecture was 1,841,690. ‘“ The
area of the prefecture being about 4,500 square miles, the average
population would therefore seem to be about 409 to the square mile
in this prefecture, and thus largely in excess of the general average
of the province.”

The best available information concerning the area of the province
of Che-kiang © gives it as 34,700 square miles. Assuming, then, that
the average population to the square mile is one-fifth less than in the
prefecture of Wen-chou (say 325 to the square mile), the total popu-
lation of the province in 1881 would have been about 11,145,000—a
figure substantially agreeing with that given by the governor of the
province for 1879 and that supplied Popoff in 1882.

The population of Che-kiang, according to the above figures,
increased from 1879 to 1882—say about three years (1880-1) from
11,541,054 to 11,588,692, or 47,638. From 1882 to 1885 (also three
years) it increased from 11,588,692 to 11,684,348, or 95,656. This
would be an annual increase from 1879 to 1882 of 0.206 per cent,
and from 1882 to 1885 of 0.275 per cent, or an average yearly rate
from 1879 to 1885 of 0.240 per cent—this under the most favorable
possible circumstances, the country being blessed with peace and
plenty during all that period and for some years previously. At this

Che-kiang show just the contrary of what I am seeking to prove, but it must
be seen at once how fanciful must be the returns of population when the total
mumber in a vast province is deduced from a rough count in a small district.
This is substantially the method the Chinese follow,

rate the population of Che-kiang would double itself by natural
increase in 417 years. :

Newsholme,’ calculating the average birth rate and death rate for
the five years 1891-1895, found that in Prussia the population would
double itself by natural increase in 49.2 years; in England in 59.1
years; in Italy in 65.7 years; in Austria in 74.1 years, and in France
in 591 years, the annual increase in the period named averaging in
the latter country only 0.08 per 1,000. Conditions of life in other
provinces of the Empire of China are approximately the same as in
Che-kiang—in fact, in a number they are worse, particularly as
regards the frequency of famines, floods, and epidemics; neverthe-
less, Chinese enumerations would have us believe that the population
in China increases more rapidly than in the most favored countries of
the world.

In the case of China, natural increase is the only one to be taken in
line of count; Immigration into China is practically nil, and emigra-
tion from China proper to other portions of the Empire, excluding
Asia, has only within quite recent times become of considerable size,
and even now it 1s not sufficient to appreciably affect the sum total
of the population in the approximate count we are trying to make of
it. The only migratory movements of the Chinese have been from
province to province of the Empire. Without going far back into
the past it will suffice to mention the repopulation of the provinces of
Ssi-ch’uan and Yiin-nan after the Manchu conquest from the Hu
Kuang provinces and the similar movement to Sst-ch’uan during
the great T’ai-p’ing rebelhion. The emigration from Shan-hsi into
southern and eastern Mongoha after the famine of 1877-78, and that
from Shan-tung and Chih-h into Manchuria still gomg on, are the
most important recent movements of population to outlying parts
of the Chinese Empire. The emigration to southern Asia and_ to
remoter parts of the world is drawn exclusively from the provinces
of Fu-kien and Kuang-tung, and though considerable, is not so large
as to affect to any appreciable degree the rough figures of population
we hope to establish.”

Very little accurate information has come to us as to the death
rate in any given locality of China; in fact, the only official data I
know of is the death rate in Peking during one year, 1845, for which
year we have also the returns of a detailed census of the population
within the Peking city walls. These were obtained by Sacharoff
and published in his valuable study, cited previously. According to

dren, say, under 5 years of age) during the whole year was 39,438,
or about 23.9 per 1,000 inhabitants-—by no means an excessive rate.

The death rate among infants, resulting from the highly insani-
tary conditions in which the whole population, rich and_ poor,
throughout the Empire constantly lives, and also from female in-
fanticide, must be exceedingly high. This latter cause of infant
mortality is accountable for a considerably increased death rate in
the provinces of Kuang-tung, Fu-kien, Che-kiang, Shan-hsi, Kiang-
hsi, An-hui, and in most of the other provinces of the Empire in a
lesser degree.”

Everything considered—especially the fact that in a very large
part of China the people live huddled together in towns and villages,
and that nowhere is any attempt ever made toward sanitation or the
prevention of the spread of contagious disease—it seems quite safe
to put the death rate in China at 30 per 1,000 as a minimum.

Let us revert now to the figures given by the Chinese Government
for the population at the varies periods since 1741 and see whether
the annual rates of increase are at all reasonable. This examination
is distinctly disappointing; nothing less satisfactory could be con-
ceived. Between 1743 and 1788—during which time China enjoyed
extraordinary peace and prosperity, disturbed only by some uprisings
of aboriginal tribes in the mountainous regions of the west, and two
small rebellions, one in Shan-tung in 1777, the other in Shen-hsi in
1781—no great famines or other natural calamities are: recorded.
Nevertheless, the annual rate of increase of the population (the
enumerations being all presumably made in the same manner, with
the same classes excepted), which between 1748 and 1749 was 2.90
per cent, fell from 1749 to 1757 to 0.91 per cent, to rise between 1757
to 1761 to 1.87 per cent, falling again to 0.73 per cent between 1761
and 1767, and to 0.57 per cent from that date to 1771. The next
change is phenomenal: Between 1771 and 1776 it was 5 per cent, but
immediately after, between 1776 and 1780 it fell, without any known
reason, to 0.86 per cent, to rise again between that date and 1783 to
2.34 per cent. The average annual rate of increase during the whole
period was 1.83 per cent. In Japan, where much more favorable
conditions exist than in China, the average yearly increase of the
population from 1872 to 1899 has been only 1.04 per cent.

If we accept the figure given for the population in 1741 (148,412,-
000) as being closer the truth than subsequent ones, and bearing in
mind the reasons given previously for and against a rapid increase of
population, we may assume that the population of China proper
barely doubled in the hundred years following; consequently in 1842,
instead of being, as given in the official enumeration, 413,000,000, it

was probably about 250,000,000.

Referring now to the extraordinary causes of mortality from 1842
down to the present day, some of which are mentioned on preceding

674 INQUIRY INTO THE POPULATION OF CHINA.

We are therefore led to the inevitable conclusion that the present
population of China proper can not greatly exceed that of 1842, a
conclusion reached by another line of argument in 1881 by my friend
A. E. Hippisley, in his too-brief study above referred to, and by Mr.
Popoff in 1884.

The following considerations tend to strengthen this opinion: The
most recent enumeration of the population of China which can lay
claim to any value is that of 1885. In it we find that the returns
given for six provinces (Chi-hi, Anhoui, Kan-Soo, Kuang-hsi, Ytin-
nan, and Kuei-Chu) are the same as those given in the earlier census
of 1882, but which in this latter were in reality for the year 1879. A
comparison of the official estimates for these provinces, with the esti-
mates made by careful foreign investigators is highly interesting.

In the case of the province of Sstt-ch’uan, which the board of reve-
nue estimated at 71,073,730 in 1885, all foreign writers agree that it
is quite impossible to beheve that any such population exists or can
exist in it. Its western, northwestern, and southwestern parts are
extremely mountainous and very sparsely inhabited. Furthermore,
the province contains no extremely populous cities. Ch’éng-tu, the
rapital, has about 350,000, and Ch’ung-k’ing about 130,000.

The Lyons Commercial Mission, speaking of the year 1895-96,
states its behef that the estimates of the maritime customs at Ch’ung-
k’ing for 1891 of 30,000,000 to 35,000,600 for the province of Ssu-
vl’uan is too low, but accepts that of from 46,000,000 to 45,000,000.7
G. J. L. Litton, writing in 1898, estimated the population of Sst-
ch’uan at more than double that given in the enumeration of 1812,
and put it at 48,000,000. F.S. A. Bourne, also writing in 1898, says
that the population of Ssti-ch’uan is probably between 45,000,000 and
55,000,000. In a report in 1904 Hosie gives it as 45,000,000.¢

Kiang-hsi, for which the official returns give a population of more
than 24,000,000, is believed by W. J. Clennell, writing in 1903, to
have less than 12,000,000.4. The same writer estimates the popula-
of Fu-kien in 1903 at “certainly under 19,000,000,” whereas the
Chinese figure for 1885 is 23,502,794. As regards Yiinnnan, the
Lyons Mission® puts the population in 1896 at from 7,000,000 to
3,000,000. F. S. A. Bourne, writing of Ytin-nan in 1896, says that
* according to the best native authority the population is estimated at
one-fifth of what it was before the (Mohammedan) rebellion,’

while Litton, in 1903, thought it was “ not over 10,000,000." The
Chinese estimate of the population of this province in 1879 (the same
figure is given for 1885). was 11,721,576, but only two years before
that, in 1877, General Mesney ” placed it at 5,600,000.

Kuei-chou in or about 1896 was thought to have about 7,000,000
inhabitants,’ in this agreeing with the Chinese estimate.

Without going any further we see that for the five provinces above
mentioned foreign investigators substantially agree that the Chinese
estimates are too large by some 56,000,000. All the Chinese figures
are one-half to one-third too high. TI have not the least doubt that
the same reduction must apply to the estimates for most of the other
provinces, the error in excess increasing presumably with the density
of the population. The conviction is therefore forced on me that the
present population of China proper does not exceed 275,000,000, and
is probably considerably under this figure.

The population of China is most unevenly distributed. In cer-
tain sections, for example, around Swatow, and in portions of Ho-nan,
Shan-tung, and Chih-li, it is extraordinarily dense, while in others,
as Kan-su, Yiin-nan, Kuei-chou, and Kuang-hsi, it is surprisingly
sparse. Guesses of the population based on partial returns from some
densely populated center would give a most erroneous idea of the
population not only of the province as a whole, but of even a smaller
division of the country. TIT have traversed several times all the north-
ern provinces of China—Chih-li, Shan-hsi, Shen-hsi, and Kan-su—
and can vouch for the fact that in none of them does the population
appear to exceed in numbers what the soil can easily support. The
absence of easy lines of communication over which surplus produce
can be readily exported, and the fact that the Chinese do not raise
cattle or any domestic animals in considerable numbers, tend to re-
strict the areas cultivated by the farmer. It seems certain that China
could support a much larger population than it now has

a condition
which could not exist if the population had reached the enormous

figure which imaginative writers give us. T am confirmed in this
opinion by such a careful observer as F. S. A. Bourne, who, referring
to the journey of the Blackburn Chamber of Commerce mission,!
which traversed the whole Yang-tzt. Valley and southwestern China,
says: “ From what we have seen on this journey I should say that
China could support twice her present population, and that each man

The figures given in the censuses of 1761, 1842, 1882, and 1885 were supplied
to Father Amiot, Sacharoff, Popoff, and Rockhill by the Chinese board of reve-
nue. Figures in the returns for 1882 and 1885 marked with an asterisk are
those given to Sacharoff for the year 1879. They are the latest official esti-
mates.

The figures given under the census of 1812 are taken from Sacharoff, whose
authority was presumably the official Va Ch’ing Hui-tien.

a47n a most interesting study entitled *“* Tenure of Land in China and the
Condition of the Rural Population” (Journ. Ch. Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc, N. S.,
XXIII, pp. 59-174) we find it stated (pp. 76-79) on excellent authority that * it
is impossible to say with any sort of exactness what proportion of the whole
soil of China is tilled by peasant owners, but probably it can not be put at less
than one-half. The other moiety is owned in great measure by retired officials
and their families, the class known as the literati and gentry. * * * Con-
siderable tracts of land are owned by such families, and it is the invariable
rule in these cases to lease the land to small farmers. In the central and popu-
lous parts of China these holdings are exceedingly small, often less than an
English acre, seldom larger than three or four acres. * * * Most ijands
yield one or more subsidiary crops in the course of the vear, besides the prin-
cipal crop. * On the frontier provinces, where the soil is poorer and
the population more sparse, the size of the holdings is in general much larger
than in the central provinces, and the people would seem as a rule to be better
off. But as population increases there seems everywhere to be a strong tendency
for holdings to become reduced to the minimum size that will support a single
family. The more fertile the soil the smaller the farms and the more minute
the subdivision. Tow marvelously fertile the soil is under fayorable circum-
stances will be seen from the fact that * * * one mow (6.6 to an acre) wil!
support one individual. On this basis a square mile is capable of supporting
a population of 3,840 persons.”
* CHINESE ARCHITECTURE.¢

By STEPHEN W. BUSHELL, C. M. G., B. Se, M. D.

The first impression given by the view of a Chinese city from the
parapet of the city wall—whether it be Tientsin, with the 150,000
houses of its population of shopmen and artisans, or Peking, with
its temples, its imperial and princely palaces, and its public build-
ings—is that of a certain monotony, resulting from the predomi-
nance of a single type of architecture. After a long residence this
impression still remains. and it is very rarely that a building stands
out which is not reducible to one general formula.

China, in fact, in every epoch of its history and for all its edifices,
civil or religious, public or private, has kept to a single architectural
model. Even when new types have been introduced from the West
under the influence of Buddhism and Mohammedanism, the lines
have become gradually toned down and conformed to his own
standard by the leveling hands of the Chinese mason. It is a car-
dinal rule in Chinese geomancy that every important building must
face the south, and the uniform orientation resulting from this adds
to the general impression of monotony.

The most general model of Chinese buildings is the ting. This
consists essentially of a massive roof with recurved edges resting
upon short columns. The curvilinear tilting of the corners of the
roof has been supposed to be a survival from the days of tent
dwellers, who used to hang the angles of their canvas pavilions on
spears; but this is carrying it back to a very dim antiquity, as we
have no records of the Chinese except as a settled agricultural peo-
ple. The roof is the principal feature of the building and gives to
it when finished its qualities of grandeur or simplicity, of strength
or grace. To vary its aspect the architect is induced occasionally
to double, or even to triple, it. This preponderance of a part usually
sacrificed in western architecture is justified by the smaller vertical

elevation of the plan, and the architect devotes every attention to the
decoration of the roof by the addition of antefixal ornaments, and
by covering it with glazed tiles of brillant color, so as to concen-
trate the eye upon it. The dragons and phenixes posed on the crest
of the roof, the grotesque animals perched in lines upon the eaves,
and the yellow, green, and blue tiles which cover it are never chosen
at random, but after strict sumptuary laws, so that they may denote
the rank of the owner of a house or indicate the imperial foundation
of a temple.

The great weight of the roof necessitates the multiple employ-
ment of the column, which is assigned a function of the first im-
portance. The columns are made of wood; the shaft is generally
cylindrical, occasionally polyhedral, never channeled; the capital
is only a kind of consol, squared at the ends or shaped into dragons’
heads; the pedestal is a square block of stone chiseled at the top
into a circular base on which the shaft is posed. The pedestal, ac-
cording to rule, ought not to be higher than the width of the column,
and the shaft not more than ten times longer than its diameter.
Large trunks of the Persea nanmu from the Province of Sstichuan
are floated down the Yangtze River to be brought to Peking to be
used as columns for the palaces and large temples.

The nanmu is the tallest and straightest of Chinese trees, the
graim improves by age, and the wood gradually acquires a dead-
leaf brown tint, while it preserves its aromatic qualities, so that the
superb columns of the sacrificial temple of the Emperor Yung Lo
(pl. 1), which date from the early part of the fifteenth century,
still exhale a vague perfume. The pillars are brightened with ver-
milion and gold, but it is the roof which still attracts most attention,
in the interior as well as outside, the beams being often gorgeously
inlaid with colors and the intervening ceiling geometrically divided
into sunken panels worked in relief and lacquered with dragons or
some other appropriate designs.

The stability of the structure depends upon the wooden framework ;
the walls, which are filled in afterwards with blocks of stone or brick-
work, are not intended to figure as supports; the space, in fact, is
often occupied entirely by doors and windows, carved with elegant
tracery, of the most flimsy character. A Chinese fabric so far is curi-
ously analogous to a modern American building of the newest type,
with its skeleton framework of steel filled in with dummy walls.

The Chinese seem to have a feeling of the innate poverty of their
architectural designs and strive to break the plain lines with a pro-
fusion of decorative details. The ridge poles and corners of the
sagging roofs are covered with finial dragons and long rows of fan-
tastic animals, arranged after a symbolism known only to the iiti-
ated, the eaves are underlaid with elaborately carved woodwork

brilliantly lacquered, the walls are outlined with bands of terra-cotta
reliefs molded with figures and floral sprays; but in spite of every-
thing the monotony of the original type is always apparent.

Chinese buildings are usually one-storied and are developed hori-
zontally as they are increased in size or number. The principle which
determines the plan of projection is that of symmetry. The main
buildings and wings, the side buildings, the avenues, the courtyards,
the pavilions, the motives of decoration, all the details, in fact, are
planned symmetrically. The architect only departs from this formal
rule in the case of summer residences and gardens, which are, on the
contrary, designed and carried out in the most capricious fashion.
Here we have pagodas and kiosques elevated at random, detached
edifices of the most studied irregularity, rustic cottages and one-
winged pavilions, dotted down in the midst of surroundings of the
most complicated and artificial nature, composed of rockeries, lakes,
waterfalls, and running streams spanned by fantastic bridges, with
an unexpected surprise at every turn.

Ruins in China are rare, and we must turn to books to get some
idea of ancient architecture. The first large builedings described in
the oldest canonical books are the lofty towers called * t’ai,” which
were usualy square and built of stone, rising to the height sometimes
of 300 feet, so that they are stigmatized as rumous follies of the
ancient kings. There were three kinds of t’ai, one intended as a
storehouse for treasures, a second built within a walled hunting park
for watching military exercises and the pleasures of the chase, and a
third, the kuan hsiang t’ai, fitted up as an astronomical observatory.
The Hsia dynasty, of the second millenium B. C., was renowned for
its buildings and irrigation works; their predecessor, Shun, as a
patron of the potter’s art; while among their successors the Shang
dynasty was celebrated for its sacrificial vessels and wine cups, the
Chou dynasty for the finish of its hunting and war chariots. Among
the later representatives of the t’ai are the towers of the great wall,
which are built of stone with arched doors and windows—the Chinese
would seem always to have employed the arch in stone architecture
the storied buildings dominating the gateways and angles of the city
walls, often used to store arms, and the observatory of Peking,
which is also a square tower mounted upon the city wall. When
the tower is planned of oblong section, broader than it is deep, it is
technically called a “ lou.”

Chinese buildings might be classified as civil, religious, and fune-
real, but it is more convenient to group all together in the few illus-
trations allowed in our limited space. The Hall of the Classics,

and the stone drums, as described above, are installed. The Emperor
goes there in state on certain occasions to expound the classics, seated
upon the large throne within the hall, which is backed by a screen
fashioned in the form of the five sacred mountains. It is a lofty
square building with a four-sided roof covered with tiles enameled
imperial vellow, and surmounted by a large gilded ball, encircled by
a pillared veranda under a second projecting roof of yellow tiles.
The four sides consist each one of seven pairs of folding doors with
tracery panels. It is surrounded by a circular moat with marble
balustrades, crossed by four bridges leading to the central doors. On
the sides of the courtyard in which it stands are two long cloistered
buildings, sheltering about 200 upright stone stele covered with in-
scriptions over the front or back. The inscriptions comprise the
complete text of the “nine classics,’ and were engraved by the
Emperor Cl’ien Lung, in emulation of the Han and T’ang dynasties,
both of which had the canonical books cut in stone at Si An Fu, the
capital of China in their times. The text is divided on the face of
the stone into pages of convenient size, so that rubbings may be taken
on paper and bound up in the form of books. It was the custom as
early as the Han dynasty to take such impressions, a practice which
may possibly have first suggested the idea of block printing.

A sundial of antique form is seen mounted on a stone pedestal in
the foreground of the picture. On the other side of the hall, the
south, stands a magnificent “ porcelain ” pailou, resembling the one
illustrated in plate m1, which spans the avenue leading to Wo Fo Sst.
the “temple of the sleeping Buddha,” in the western hills near
Peking. The pedestals and three arches are built of sculptured mar-
ble, separated by walls of vermilion stucco from the paneled facing
of faience covering the rest of the structure, which is enameled in
and forms an elaborate frame-

three colors—yellow, green, and blue
work for the inscribed tablet of white marble enshrined in the center.
This tablet, the motive of the erection, displays a short dedicatory
formula, composed and presented by the Emperor, which is chiseled
and filled in with red in the actual lines of his original brushwork.
These archways, which are a characteristic feature of Chinese archi-
tecture, are only erected by special authority. They are generally
made of wood with tiled roof, and are usually intended as memorials
of distinguished men and women. Some, however, are built entirely
of stone, like the immense gateway with five portals at the avenue
of the Ming tombs. The stone toran of Indian stupas is doubtless
the original form from which the Chinese pailou, as well as the
Japanese tori, is derived.

One of the grandest and most interesting sights of Peking is the
Temple of Heaven, which is within the southern or Chinese city, sur-
rounded by stately cypress trees in the midst of a walled park over

8 miles round. The oxen used in sacrifice are kept in the park, and
there are separate inclosures provided for the other sacrificial ani-
mals, which include sheep, deer, pigs, and hares. The consecrated
meats are prepared in accordance with an ancient ritual in kitchens
built for the purpose, to which are attached special slaughterhouses,
well houses, and stores for vegetables, fruit, corn, and wine. The
Chinese have no idea of vicarious sacrifice, the offerings to their
supreme deity are lke the precious objects, raiment, and foods which
are set forth in ancestral worship. Heaven is not worshiped alone;
the ancestral tablets of four of the imperial forefathers are always
associated with the tablet of Shang Ti, the “ supreme deity,” followed
by those of the sun, moon, planets, and starry constellations, while
the spirits of the atmosphere, winds, clouds, rain, and thunder are
ranged in subordinate rank below. Heaven is distinguished by the
offering of blue jade pi, a foot in diameter, round and with a square
hole in the middle, like the ancient mace-head symbols of sovereignty,
and by the bullock being sacrificed as a whole burnt offering. The
jade and silk are also burned; twelve rolls of plain white silk and
hempen cloth being sacrificed for heaven, one for each of the other
spirits; while the banquet piled on the altar in dishes of blue por-
celain is proportionately lavish.

The great altar of heaven, Tien T’an, the most sacred of all Chi-
nese religious structures, is seen in plate rv. It consists of three circu-
lar terraces with marble balustrades and triple staircases at the four
cardinal points to ascend to the upper terrace, which is 90 feet wide,
the base being 210 feet across. The platform is laid with marble
stones in nine concentric circles and everything is arranged in mul-
tiples of the number 9. The Emperor, prostrate before heaven on
the altar, surrounded first by the circles of the terraces and their
railings, and then by the horizon, seems to be in the center of the
universe, as he acknowledges himself inferior to heaven and to
heaven alone. Round him on the pavement are figured the nine cir-
cles of as many heavens, widening in successive multiples till the
square of 9, the favorite number of numerical philosophy, is reached
in the outer circle of 81 stones. The great annual sacrifice on
the altar is at dawn on the winter solstice, the Emperor having
proceeded in state in a carriage drawn by an elephant the day before,
and spent the night in the hall of fasting called Chai Kung, after
first imspecting the offerings. The sacred tablets are kept in the
building with a round roof of blue enameled tiles behind the altar
which is seen on the right of the picture. The furnace for the whole
burnt offering stands on the southeast of the altar, at the distance of
an arrow flight; it is faced with green tiles, and is 9 feet high,
ascended by three flights of green steps, the bullock being placed

.

inside upon a iron grating, under which the fire is kindled. The
682 CHINESE ARCHITECTURE.

rolls of silk are burned in eight openwork iron urns, stretching from
the furnace round to the eastward; an urn is added when an Em-
peror dies. The prayers written upon silk are also burned in these
urns after they have been formally presented in worship before the
tablets.

To the north of the great altar, which is open to the sky, there is a
second three-tiered marble altar conceived in similar lines, but some-
what smaller, called the “ Ch’1 Ku T’an,” or “altar of prayer for
grain.” This is dominated by the imposing triple-roofed temple
presented in plate v, which is covered with tiles of deep cobalt blue
shining in the sunlight so as to make it the most conspicuous object
in the city. The name of this edifice, as set forth on the framed
plaque fixed under the eaves of the upper roof, in Manchu and Chi-
nese script, is Ch’i Nien Tien (temple of prayer for the year). The
Emperor goes there early each year in spring to make offerings for
a propitious year. It is 99 feet high, the upper roof supported by
four stately pillars, the lower roofs by two circles of 12 pillars, all
straight trunks of nam-mu trees recently brought up from the south-
west, when the temple had to be rebuilt after its destruction by fire.
Originally founded by the Emperor Cl’ien Lung, it was rebuilt dur-
ing the present reign in every detail after the old plan. During the
ceremonies inside everything is blue; the sacrificial utensils are of
blue porcelain, the worshippers are robed in blue brocades, even the
atmosphere is blue, venetians made of thin rods of blue glass, strung
together by cords, being hung down over the tracery of the doors and
windows. Color symbolism is an important feature of Chinese
rites; at the temple of earth all is yellow; at the temple of the sun,
red; at the temple of the moon, white, or rather the pale grayish
blue which is known as “* yueh pai,” or moonhght white, pure white
being reserved for mourning. The altar of the earth, Ti T’an, is on
the north of the city, outside the city wall, and is square in form;
the offerings are buried in the ground instead of being burned. The
temples of the sun and moon are on the east and west and are also
outside the city wall of Peking; the princes of the blood are usually
deputed by the Emperor to officiate at these.

A good illustration of the ting, which is so characteristic of Chinese
architecture, has been given in plate 1, from a photograph of the large
sacrificial hall of the Emperor Yung Lo. The tombs of the Ming
dynasty, called colloquially “ Shih-san Ling,” “ Tombs of the Thir-
teen (IKmperors),” are, as the name indicates, the last resting places
of thirteen of the Ming Emperors. The first was buried at Nanking,
his capital; the last near a Buddhist temple on a hill west of Peking,
by command of the Manchu rulers when they obtained the Empire.
The Emperor Yung Lo (1403-1424), who made Peking his capital,
choose this beautiful valley for the mausoleum of his house. It is

6 miles long, 30 miles distant from Peking to the north, and the
imperial tombs are in separate walled inclosures, dotting the slopes
of the wooded hills whieh skirt the valley.

The avenue, with its row of colossal stone figures, has been noticed
in the last chapter. At che end of the avenue one comes to a triple
gateway leading to a court with a smaller hall, and passes through
to reach the main courtyard with the large sacrificing hall, where, by
order of the Manchu Emperors, offerings are still presented to the
long-deceased ruler of a fallen dynasty by one of his lineal descend-
ants selected for the purpose. The hall is mounted upon a terrace,
with three balustrades of carved marble extending all around, as-
cended by three flights of 18 steps in front and behind, leading to three
portals with folding doors of tracery. It is 70 yards long by 30 deep,
with a massive tiled roof supported by eight rows of four pillars
each. The columns, of Persea nanmu wood, are 12 feet around at the
base and over 60 feet high to the true roof, under which there is a
lower ceiling, about 35 feet from the floor, made of wood in sunken
square panels painted in bright colors. The ancestral tablet is kept
in a yellow roofed shrine mounted upon a dais, with a large carved
screen in the background, and in front stands a sacrificial table with
an incense urn, a pair of pricket candlesticks, and a pair of fiower
vases ranged in line upon it. Leaving this magnificent hall and pass-
ing through another court, planted lke those preceding, with pines,
arbor-vite trees, and oaks, one comes to the actual tomb. A subter-
ranean passage 40 yards long leads to the tumulus, the door of which
is closed by masonry, but flights of steps east and west lead to the
top of the grave terrace. Here, in front of the mound and immedi-
ately above the coffin passage, is the tombstone, an immense upright
slab, mounted upon a tortoise, inscribed with the posthumous title,
“Tomb of the Emperor Ch’éng Tsu Wen.” The tumulus is more
than half a mile in circuit, and, though artificial, looks like a natural
hill, being planted with trees to the top, among which the large-
leafed oak (Quercus bungeana), on which wild silkworms are fed,
is conspicuous.

The usual paraphernalia of the shrine of an ancestral temple are
seen in plate vt, which is a view of the interior of the Confucian
temple in the Kuo Tzt: Chien, the old national university of Peking.
The ancestral tablet is seen dimly in the center of the picture en-
shrined in an alcove between two pillars. The tablet, 2 feet 5 imeches
high and 6 inches broad, mounted upon a pedestal 2 feet high, is in-
seribed in gold letters upon a lacquered vermilion ground in Manchu
and Chinese, “ The tablet of the spirit of the most holy ancestral
teacher, Confucius.” The pillars are hung with laudatory couplets,
and the beams with dedicatory inscriptions,one of which is penciled by
sxach sueceeding Emperor in token of his veneration for the sage. The
684 GHINESE ARCHITECTURE.

line of four large characters above, for example, Wan shih shih piao,
“the model teacher of myriad ages,” was composed and written by
the Emperor K’ang Hsi in the twenty-fourth year of his reign (A. D.
1685), and is authenticated by his seal attached to the inscription.
The wu kung (“sacrificial set of five”), comprising incense urn,
pricket candlesticks, and flower vases made of bronze, is here posed on
separate stands of white marble. In front of all is the table ready
for the sacrificial offerings, which are regularly presented at spring.
and autumn. The rest of the large hall is lined with tablets of Tséng
Tzu, Mencius, and the other distinguished sages and disciples of Con-
fucius, whose spirits are officially worshiped in turn on the same cer-
emonial occasions.

The ornamental lines of an open garden pavilion, which also comes
under the general heading of t’ing, are fairly exhibited in plate vir, in
spite of the half-ruined condition of the picturesque structure, as it
appeared when it was photographed after the destruction of the sum-
mer palace during the Anglo-French expedition of 1860. It stands
on the border of the lake at Wan Shou Shan, having recently been
repaired for the Empress Dowager, who has tea served there for her
European guests, brought from Peking in state barges towed by steam
tugs. It is hung with bronze bells which tinkle softly in the breeze.
The central building, as well as the two pailous spanning the avenues
through which it is approached, has its woodwork gaily decorated
with painted scrolls, relieved by graceful bands of open fret, and it is
roofed over all with yellow enameled tiles. Notice the stone mon-
sters at the four corners mounted upon short octagonal pillars with
decorated capitals, which might be remote descendants of the ancient
Hindu lon pillars of Asoka’s time molded on modern Chinese lines.

A view of the K’un-ming Hu, the lake which has just been referred
to, is given in plate vir. The name comes down from the Han
dynasty, when it was given to a lake near Si-an Fu, the metropolis of
the period in the Province of Shensi, on which the Emperor Wu Ti
had a fleet of war junks maneuvering to exercise the sailors for the
conquest of Cochin China. The present lake, which is 4 miles in cir-
cult, has been the first of the inland waters of China to have modern
armed steamers in its waters, when the Empress Dowager had a
review of model ships built at her command the year before the
Boxer troubles. The imperial pavilion, erected by the Emperor
Cl’ien Lung on the spot where the best view of the lake was to be
obtained, is a prominent object in the picture. He was fond of
inditing verses, and a favorite ode of his composition on the beauty
of the surrounding scene is incised there on a marble stele.

The bronze ox in the foreground was also molded under his
auspices, and it is inscribed, as may be seen in the picture, with
dedicatory stanzas written by the imperial brush, which are printed

in the official description of Peking. The ox, as the chief agricul-
tural animal, has been sacred in China from the earhest times, and
it still has a foremost place in rustic spring ceremonial, being
molded in clay for the purpose. The verses, which are too long to
be quoted in full, relate how the Emperor has taken as his model the
ancient Yu of Hsia, whose eulogy was handed down on an iron ox
after he had carried off the river floods, how he has propitiated the
sacred ox, a constellation of the zodiac, the queller of dragons and
river monsters, and installed its figure here to preside forever over
the irrigation channels which he has dug for the benéfit of the
villagers, concluding with the peroration :

Men praise the warrior emperor of the Han,

We prefer as our example the ancient Yao of T’ang.

The marble bridge of 17 arches in the picture is a remarkable
example of the fine stone bridges for which the neighborhood of
Peking has been celebrated since Marco Polo described the many-
arched bridge of Pulisanghin, with its marble parapets crowned with
lions, which spans the river Hunho and is still visible from the hills
which form the background of the summer palace. Our bridge,
which was built in the twentieth year of Clvien Lung (A. D. 1755),
leads from the cemented causeway to an island in the lake with an
ancient temple dedicated to the dragon god and called Lung Shen
Sst, the name of which was changed by Cl’ien Lung to Kuang Jun
Sst, the “ Temple of Broad Fertility,’ because the Emperor, as a
devout Buddhist, objected to the deification of the Naga Raja, the
traditional enemy of the faith.

A characteristic bridge of different form on the western border of
the lake is illustrated in plate 1x. This is called, from its peculiar
shape, the Lo-ko Ch’lao or Hunchback Bridge, and has only one
arch, 30 feet high, with a span of 24 feet. Its height allows the
imperial barges to pass underneath without lowering their masts,
and it is withal one of the most picturesque features of the landscape.

A bronze temple which stands on the southern slope of the hill
of Wan Shou Shan is seen in plate x. It is 20 feet high, double
roofed, and designed in the usual lines, but every detail is executed
in bronze, the pillars, beams, tiles, tracery of doors and windows,
and all ornamental appendages having been previously molded
in metal. This is one of the few buildings which defied the fire in
1860. It stands on a marble foundation with carved railings and
steps, which are piled with bricks and bushes to keep off pilferers of
the valuable material. The miniature stupa, or dagaba, which crowns
the crest of the roof, is an attribute of a Buddhist building, and this
one, 1n fact, is intended to be a shrine for the historical Buddha, as it
contains a gilded image of Sakyamuni enthroned on a lotus thalamus,
with the usual'set of utensils for burning incense.
686 CHINESE ARCHITECTURE.

The pagoda illustrated in plate x1 from the grounds of the impe-
rial summer palace of Yuan-ming Yuan is a fine example of archi-
tectural work in glazed faience, in the style of the famous porcelain
tower of Nanking. The Nanking pagoda was razed to the ground
by the Taiping rebels in the year 1854, but specimens of the tiles and
ornamental fixtures are preserved in the museum. The practice of
facing buildings, inside as well as outside, with slabs or tiles of
faience coated with colored glazes is very ancient in Asia. The pro-
cessions of archers and lons lining the walls of the staircases of the
palaces of Darius at Susa are striking examples of early date, and
the art was further developed in the decoration of the mosques and
tombs of Persia and Transoxiana during the middle ages. It dates
in China from the later Han dynasty, during which green glazed
pottery first came into vogue, and was revived in the earlier half of
the fifth century, when artisans are recorded to have come from the
Yueh-ti, an Indo-Scythian kingdom on the northwestern frontiers of
India, and to have taught the Chinese the art of making different
kinds of lu-h, or colored glazes. The center of the manufacture to-
day is Po-shan Hsien, in the province of Shantung, where slabs and
rods of colored frits are produced, to be exported to all parts of the
country, whenever required for the decoration of cloisonné and
painted enamels on metal, porcelain, or faience. The imperial pot-
teries for this kind of work are established in a valley of the western
hills near Peking, as well as in the mountains in the vicinity of Muk-
den, the capital of Manchuria. Figures of Buddha and other temple
divinities are fabricated at these works, as well as the many kinds of
antefixal ornaments, facings, and colored tiles required for imperial
buildings. When a suite of European palaces was designed by the
Jesuits Attiret and Castighone for Yuan-ming Yuan, enameled
fountains, elaborate screens with trophies, helmets and shields, balus-
trades with ornamental flowerpots and the like were executed at these
potteries in orthodox Italian style.

The glazes used in the decoration of this pagoda are five in number:
A deep purplish blue derived from a compound of cobalt and man-
ganese silicates; a rich green from copper silicate; a yellow, approach-
ing the tint of the yolk of an egg, from antimony; a sang de beeuf red
from copper mixed with a deoxidizing flux, and a charming turquoise
blue derived from copper combined with niter. The last two are
more sparingly employed than the rest. The fivefold combination is
intended to suggest the five jewels of the Buddhist paradise. A
jeweled pagoda, pao t’a, of portentous dimensions, is supposed, in the

suddhist cosmos, to tower upward from the central peak of the
sacred mount Meru, to pierce the loftiest heaven, and to illuminate
the boundless ether with effulgent rays proceeding from the three

jewels of the law and the revolving wheel with which it is crowned.
Speculative symbolism of this kind is carried out in the form of the
pagoda. The base, four-sided, represents the abode of the four ma-
harajas, the great guardian kings of the four quarters, whose figures
are seen enthroned here within the open arches. The center, octa-
gonal, represents the Tushita heaven, with eight celestial gods, Indra.
Agni, and the rest, standing outside as protectors of the eight points
of the compass; this is the paradise of the Bodhisats prior to their
final descent to the human world as Buddhas, and Maitreya, the com-
ing Buddha, dwells here. The upper story, circular in form, repre-
sents the highest heaven, in which the Buddhas reside after attaining
complete enlightenment; the figures in niches are the five celestial
Buddhas, or Jinas, seated on lotus pedestals.

The ordinary pagoda of 13 stories, octagonal in section, solidly
built of brick upon massive stone foundations, is seen in plate xr.
This one, which dates from the end of the seventh century, is attached
to the temple of Ling-kuang Sst, in the western hills near Peking,
and it is plainly visible from the top of the city wall 12 miles distant.
It is not certain, however, whether it be still standing, as it was unfor-
tunately condemned to be blown up by dynamite in 1900, because the
Boxers had made this temple their headquarters. The Buddhist
monks have always chosen the most picturesque spots for their mon-
asteries, and there are no less than eight temples on the slope of this
particular hill, which is about 800 feet high, and many more in the
vicinity. Some have imperial traveling palaces, called Hsing Kung,
in adjoiming courts; all have guest rooms, k’o t’ang, as part of the
original plan for the entertainment of strangers and passing pilgrims.

The general plan of a Buddhist temple resembles that of a secular
residence, consisting of a series of rectangular courts, proceeding
from south to north, with the principal edifice in the center and the
lesser buildings at the sides. A pair of carved stone lions guard the
entrance, flanked by lofty twin columns of wood which are mounted
with banners and lanterns on high days and holidays. The gateway
is large and roofed to form a vestibule, in which are ranged, on either
side, gigantic figures of the four great kings of the devas, Ssti ta
tien wang, guarding the four quarters; while in the middle are gen-
erally enshrined small effigies of Maitreya, the Buddhist Messiah,
conceived as an obese Chinaman with protruberant belly and smiling
features, -and of Kuan Ti, the state god of war, a deified warrior,
represented as a mailed figure in the costume of the Han period,
seated in a chair.

Passing through the vestibule, one sees on either side of the first
court a pair of square pavilions containing a bronze bell and a huge
wooden drum, and in front the main hall of the temple, called T:

hsiung pao tien, the “ jeweled palace of the great hero ”—that is to
say, Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha. He is always the central
figure of the imposing triad enthroned upon lotus pedestals inside;
the two others are usually Ananda and Kasyapa, his two favorite
disciples. Along the side walls are ranged life-size figures of the
eighteen Arhans (Lohan), with their varied attributes, disciples who
have attained the stage of emancipation from rebirth. Behind the
principal court there is often another secluded courtyard sacred to
Kuan Yin,.the “ goddess of mercy,” where Chinese ladies throng to
offer petitions and make votive offerings. Avalokitesvara (Kuan
Yin) is installed here in the central hall, often supported by two
other Bodhisattvas, Manjusri (Wen-shu), the “ god of wisdom,” and
Samantabhadra (Pu-hsien), the * all-good.” The surrounding walls
are usually studded with innumerable small figures of celestial bod-
hisats, tier upon tier, molded in gilded bronze or clay, and posed in
niches. The wing buildings in this court are devoted to the de-
ceased inmates of the monastery, and contain portraits and relics of
bygone abbots and monks. The side cloisters are two-storied in the
large temples, the treasures of the monastery being stored above, as
well as libraries, blocks for printing books, and the like.

An outer wall encircles the whole, inclosing besides a stretch of the
hill slope, which affords ample space for the separate accommodation
of the higher dignitaries of the establishment, for kitchens and
stables, storehouses of fruit and grain, open pavilions for sipping tea
and enjoying the view, and secluded quarters in terraced villas for
the residence of occasional visitors.

The Buddhist triad displayed in plate xur was taken from the in-
terior of the large hall of the temple called Huang Sst, which was
built by the founder of the reigning Manchu dynasty for the resi-
dence of the fifth Grand Lama of Tibet, when the high dignitary
‘ame on a visit to Peking in the year 1647, and to which the stupa
shown in plates x1v-xv is attached. This is a lama temple, and
the large images of gilded bronze represent Avalokita, Manjusri, and
Vajrapani, seated upon lotus pedestals, the smaller standing figures
being two attendant bodhisats carrying the alms bowl and chowry
brush. The five little images posed in line in front of the pedestal
of Avalokita represent the celestial Buddhas, Amitabha and the rest,
and an image of Sakyamuni, the earthly reflex of Amitabha, is
mounted in front. The massive altar tables and the sacrificial uten-
sils and ritual svmbols placed upon them are all chiseled in marble.
The canopied background of the large figures is carved in wood and
gilded, with the aureole encircled by a frieze of elephants, lions, and
mythical animals, culminating in coiling dragons, overawed by
cherub-like garudas, which brood over the three jewels of the faith,
the whole being enveloped in a broad, rolling band of scrolled flames.

CHINESE ARCHITECTURE. 689

The difference between Lamaism and the ordinary form of Chinese
Buddhism is shown most*strongly by their discordant conceptions of
Maitreya, the coming Buddha. His Chinese statuette has been de-
seribed above, under the name of Milo Fo, as it is placed in the vesti-
bule of a temple, and he is, besides, worshiped at many private
houses and shops, so that he is almost as popular a divinity with men
at [Xuan Yin, the so-called “ goddess of mercy,” is with Chinese
women. In Japan Hotei, the merry monk with a hempen bag, is
claimed by some to be an incarnation of the Bodhisat Maitreya, and
is endowed there with national traits in the spirit of playful rever-
ence which characterizes the Japanese artist. The Lama conception
of Maitreya, on the contrary, is that of a dignified and colossal fig-
ure, robed as a prince, with the jeweled coronet of a bodhisat, tower-
ing above the other crests of the roofs of a lamasery, or occasionally
carved on the face of a cliff. There is a gigantic image of Maitreya
in the Yung Ho Kung, at Peking, made of wood, over 70 feet high,
the body of which passes through several successive stories of the
lofty building in which it is installed. The devout votary must
climb a number of winding staircases to circumambulate the sacred
cfhgy in the orthodox way, till he finally reaches the immense head.
Yung Ho Kung was the residence of the Emperor Yung Cheng be-
fore he came to the throne, and it was dedicated to the Lama Church,
in accordance with the usual custom, when he succeeded in 1722.
When the Emperor visits the temple a lamp is lit over the head of
Maitreya, and a huge praying wheel on the left, which reaches up-
ward as high as the image, is set in motion on the occasion. The
resident lamas, mostly Mongols, number some 1,500, under the rule
of a Gegen, or living Buddha, of Tibetan birth, who rejoices in the
title of Changcha-Hutuktu Lalitavajra. An excellent portrait of
this dignitary, from a miniature on silk, is given in Prof. A. Grun-
wedel’s Buddhist Art in India.

Lamaism may be said to rank as the state church of the reigning
Manchu dynasty. The Lama temple illustrated in plate xvr was built
by the Emperor K’ang Hsi, in the vicinity of the summer residence
at Jehol, outside the Great Wall of China, where Earl Macartney
was received by the grandson of the founder in 1793. The temple is
built in the style of the famous palace-temple of Potala at Lassa, the
residence of the Dalai Lama. But the resemblance is only super-
ficial; deceptive as it may be when seen at a distance from one of the
pavilions in the Imperial Park, on closer inspection the apparently
storied walls prove to be a mere shell, with doors and windows all
unperforated. The temple buildings erected upon the hill behind,
the double roofs of which appear above the walls in the picture, are

really planned in the conventional lines of the t’ing and finished
after the ordinary canons of Chinese architecture.

The picturesque stone structure illustrated in plate xv, which is
commonly called “ Wu T’a Sst,” or the “ Five-Towered Temple,” is
situated 2 miles west of Peking. It is said to be a copy of the ancient
Indian Buddhist Temple of Buddhagaya, as explained in the follow-
ing sketch of its history. In the early part of the reign of Yung Lo
(1403-1424) a Hindu sramana of high degree named Pandita came
to Peking and was given an audience by the Emperor, to whom he
presented golden images of the five Buddhas, and a model in stone
of the diamond throne, the vajrasana of the Hindus, the chin kang
pao tso of the Chinese, being the name of the memorial temple
erected on the spot where Sakyamuni attained his Buddhahood, which
has recently been restored under British auspices. The Emperor
appointed him state hierarch, conferred on him a gold seal, and
fitted up for him as a residence the “True Bodhi” temple in the
west of Peking, which had been founded during the preceding Mon-
gol dynasty, promising at the same time to erect there a reproduction
in stone of the model temple which he had brought with him, as a
shrine for the sacred images.

The new temple was not, however, finished and dedicated till the
eleventh month of the cyclical year kuei sst' (1473), of the reign of
Ch’eng Hua, according to the marble stele set up beside it, which was
inscribed by the emperor on the occasion. This states that in dimen-
sions as well as in every detail it was an exact reproduction of the
celebrated diamond throne of Central India. The temple is sur-
rounded by a carved stone railing of Indian design, which is hidden
by the wall in the picture, and which is surmounted by a stone fenc-
ing. The body of the temple, about 50 feet high, is square and of
solid construction, composed of 5 tiers of stones carved with Buddhas
seated in niches. Inside the arched doorway, right and left, are two
staircases piercing the solid stonework and leading to the flat plat-
form above, which displays in prominent relief a pair of Buddha’s
footprints and an infinite variety of symbols and Sanscrit letters
strange to Chinese architecture. Within the five pagodas of Indian
form, the central one larger than the rest, which are posed on the
platform, the golden Buddhas brought from India are said to be
enshrined, while their figures are repeated in stone and sunk in niches
on the four sides of the walls outside each pagoda. For a description
of the original temple reference may be made to Gen. Sir A. Cun-
ningham’s book, Mahabodhi, or the Great Buddhist Temple under
the Bodhi Tree at Buddha-Gaya, London, 1892.

Taoist temples are built upon the same general plan as the temples
dedicated to the Buddhist cult. The adherents of Lao Tzt have bor-
rowed from the Buddhist bonzes the interior decoration of their sacred
CHINESE ARCHITECTURE. 691

halls, as well as the plastic representation of divinities, the wor-
ship of idols, and many of their ritual ceremonies. The Buddhist
triad is replaced by an imposing triad of supreme deities called Shang
Ti, who preside over the jade paradise of the Taoist heavens; statues
of Lao Tzt and of the 8 immortals, called Pa Hsien, are posed in
prominent places; and there are separate shrines for the 38 star gods
of happiness, rank, and longevity, and for a multitude of lesser lights
of the faith whose name is legion. The sacrificial vases, candlesticks,
and incense burners, as well as the other ritual surroundings, bear
distinctive Taoist symbols and emblems.

This slight sketch of Chinese architecture may be closed by a brief
reference to Mohammedanism, which counts in China some 25,000,000
adherents, so that the emperor rules as many Muslim subjects as the
British raj, about as many as the Sultan of Turkey and Shah of
Persia together. There are about 20,000 Muslim families in Peking,
with 11 mosques. Many of their shops and eating houses are marked
with the sign of the crescent, and they have almost a monopoly of cer-
tain trades, including drivers of carts and pack mules, horse dealers,
butchers, and public bath keepers. Every large city has its mosque,
the Chinese name of which, Li Pai Ssi, or “ temple of ritual worship,”
has been generally adopted by Protestant missionaries for their
churches. The most ancient Chinese mosque is that of the * Sacred
Souvenir ” at Canton, which is said to have been founded by Saad-
ibn-abu-Waccas, maternal uncle of Mohammed, who is supposed to
have come to Canton to preach Islamism. This mosque was certainly
in existence in the ninth century, when there was an Arabian colony
in Canton. It was burned down in 1341, rebuilt soon after, and
again thoroughly restored in 1699.

Chinese mosques resemble Buddhist temples in the fact that there
is nothing in their exterior to indicate the foreign origin of the
religion to which they belong. They are of Chinese style throughout,
with the exception of lines of verses from the Koran written on
the interior walls in Arabic script in the intervals of intricate scrolls
of the usual Muslim formula, which form the only motives of
decoration. The main building is divided into five naves by three
rows of wooden pillars, the Mirhab, or wang-yu-lo, being at the end
of the central nave. The general impression, on entering, is one of
severe simplicity, contrasting strongly with the interior of a Buddhist
or Taoist temple full of gilded images and embroidered hangings.
The only furniture is one broad table of wood, carved in ordinary
Chinese style, near the entrance, on which is posed on a pedestal the
inevitable imperial tablet with the inscription “ Wan sui wan wan
sui” (a myriad years, a myriad, myriad years), which is officially
prescribed for every temple, no matter what the faith, as a pledge
of the loyalty of the worshippers. An incense-burning apparatus

in bronze of three pieces—the conventional “ Set of Three” (San
Shih), composed of a tripod urn, a round box with cover, and a vase
to hold tools, all chased with Arabic scrolls—usually stands on the
same table.

One of these Mohammedan incense burners is illustrated in plate
xvii. It is of cast bronze, shaped as a shallow bowl, with two
monster-head handles, standing on three feet, also ornamented with
masks of monsters. The sides, encircled above and below by rows of
bosses suggestive of rivets, are engraved in two panels with foliated
edges with Muslim inscriptions in debased Arabic, executed in relief
ona punched ground. It is marked inside with two dragons inclosing
the seal “Ta Ming Hsiian Té nien chih,” 1. e ., made in the reign of
Hsiian Té (A. D. 1426-1435) of the great Ming dynasty. On the
base, underneath, is another seal mark inscribed “ Nui t’an chiao
shé,” 1. e., for tutelary worship at the inner altar.

In the same courtyard as the mosque there are side buildings which
serve as cloisters for the mullahs and the other resident. officials,
including usually a school where young Muslims are taught the ele-
ments of their religion from books printed in Chinese Turkistan,
where the natives are all Mohammedans. ‘There is,as a general rule,
no minaret in Chinese mosques; the muezzin calls out the time of
prayer from the entrance gateway. <A half-ruined gateway of
unusual height is illustrated in plate xrx. It belongs to a mosque
built close outside the palace wall, within the city of Peking, by the
Kmperor Chien Lung, for the benefit of a favorite concubine, a
princess of the old royal line of Kashgaria, so that she might hear
the call to prayer from a pavilion built for her, just opposite, on a
hillock inside the wall of the prohibited palace. The Emperor tells
the story himself on a marble stele erected by him in the precincts
of the mosque with a triangular inscription, engraved in three scripts,
Manchu, Chinese, and Turki, which has been translated in the Jour-
nal Asiatique by Monsieur Devéria.

PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE

By ARTHUR LASENBY LIBERTY.

Taking first a wide survey of the whole subject, it will be remem-
bered that the advantages of using an alloy in the working of metals
appear to have been known and appreciated at a most remote period
in the history of the human race, and that not only does such process
combine the different excellencies of the two or more metals used, but
the cohesion and consequent strength of the alloy is generally found
creater than either of the metals considered separately, instead of, as
might be supposed, resulting in the exact mean strength of the two or
more metals employed. It is considered most probable, too, I believe,
that the first discovery of metals was due to the accidental presence
cf ore in the stones used in primitive hearths and fireplaces, and that,
consequently, the more readily fusible metals, such as copper, tin,
and lead, were those first known, and of these, copper being the most
widely diffused, is supposed to be the first metal used by man. Cop-
per is, however, rather difficult to cast, and it must have been one of
the most notable discoveries made by our primeval forefathers, that
by a small admixture of tin an alloy was produced that could be
sasily cast, was capable of being finished to a smooth surface with
sandstone or a file, and was very much harder than the original cop-
per itself. Weapons and instruments made of this alloy—that is to
say, of bronze—are, therefore, as is well known, characteristic of the
sarly stages of civilization—the termination of the stone age showing
cecasional evidence of the use of pure copper. In later, as well as
probably in prehistoric times, large quantities of the red metal copper
were obtained from Cyprus (whence is probably due its modern
name). While almost as far back as 4000 B. C., according to Mr.
Klinders Petrie, the Egyptians are said to have worked copper mines
in the peninsula of Sinai for the production of bronze. But the
question, I believe, is still an open one as to where the ancients de-
rived their supplies of tin. Tin, however, is mentioned among the

spoils taken from the Midianites, and it has been conjectured that it
was mined in some district of Central Asia, because it is also claimed
to have been known (though where obtained is not clear) at an
equally early date in China, and I believe, also, in Hindustan.

At a later date, but still before the Pheenicians had sailed beyond
the pillars of Hercules, tin was unquestionably shipped from 'Tartes-
sus in the south of Spain, a locality generally identified as the Tar-
shish of the book of Ezekiel. Still later, as we all know, the same
enterprising navigators traded for tin to Cornwall and Devon, the
Cornish peninsula, indeed, being identified by the Greeks solely with
that metal, and named by them “ Cassiterides,” the land of tin, a title
which, in view of the continuance and richness in the supply of this
metal, it might justifiably have retained to days within hving mem-
ory. Bronze being therefore the earliest known alloy, it may, per-
haps, be permissible to suppose that the invention of pewter was due
to an accidental reversal of the bronze-making process—that is to
say, a small quantity of copper being mixed with a large proportion
of tin. Be this as it may, such an alloy was subsequently discovered
and found to possess much greater toughness and malleability than
the pure white metal, and proved not to be affected by the acid of
Wine or vinegar (as is bronze). It was, too, both in appearance
and durability, to a certain extent a passable substitute for the rarer
metal, silver. It has even been suggested as probable that the “ tin ”
mentioned by Homer in his description of the shield of Achilles, the
“tin” statue of Dedalus referred to by Aristotle, and other similar
artistic works described by ancient writers, was in reality a kind of
pewter, since pure tin is very brittle, especially at certain tempera-
tures, and not at all adaptable for working easily with the hammer.

Plautus mentions pewter dishes as being used at a banquet, and
Galen recommends the keeping of antidotes and other drugs in ves-
sels of glass, silver, or pewter. It would exceed the bounds of this
paper, however, to attempt to follow the not too easily traceable his-
tory of pewter through the classic to the middle ages; although I
wish to call passing attention to some illustrations of pewter vessels
from the extremely interesting collection of Romano-British pewter
now in the British Museum. It will suffice to mention that the craft
existed in the early days of Greece and Rome, was never absolutely
lost, even in the dark ages, and was practiced, more or less, in Saxon
and Norman times in England as well as on the Continent. In medi-
eval days the principal patrons were, of course, the church, espe-
cially the monasteries. But I believe no specimens of this period are
now extant. And this recalls the unfortunate fact that the facility
with which pewter can be remelted and cast has been always fatal to
the survival of ancient examples, for whenever pewter objects be-
‘ame badly worn or bruised it was always customary to send them
PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE. 695

to the melting pot to be remolded. All the ancient pewter utensils
and vessels which have come down to us, are, therefore, those only
which could not readily receive damage.

As Viollet-le-Duc points out, pewter in medieval days was the
material in universal use for the tables and sideboards of the middle
and upper classes, silver plate appearing only in the royal palaces
and in the dwellings of the highest nobles, and then probably in very
limited quantities at the upper table on the dais. The peasant and
the artisan, it will be remembered, used dishes and platters of wood,
or, as it was called, “ treen,” from whence we are told comes our word
“* trencher.”

THE PEWTERERS’ CRAFT IN ENGLAND.

The manufacture of pewter, therefore, during long centuries was
a most important industry, the quantity produced was enormous,
and from the eighth century, when the mines of Spain, the only
others which appear to have been of importance, had ceased to be
available in consequence of the Moorish conquest, down to the dis-
covery and working of the tin mines at Perak, our own country
possessed a practical monopoly of the metal, for the tin derived from
Bohemian mines discovered in the thirteenth century was compara-
tively small in quantity. I would suggest, therefore, that the major
portion of the pewter made in Europe from the days of Roman civili-
zation down to the latter part of the last century, was made from
English tin; that is to say, down to the time when the general use
of pewter was supplanted by the introduction of earthenware and
glass; just as in the same way pewter itself had previously sup-
planted the general use of wooden ware. Assuming, then, the patri-
ctic postulate that Great Britain so long held a practical monopoly
in the supply of tin to the world’s markets to be correct, I purpose
referring in detail to the tin and pewter industries mainly, in this
country only, and the more particularly as they seem to be sufficiently
typical of the lke industries elsewhere.

Mr. Welch tells us that by far the larger portion of the tin pro-
duced in England was absorbed between the Pewterers’ Company of
London and members of the same craft throughout the country.
Bapst says that Bruges was the principal mart for British tin on the
continent, and that it was supplied thence to the whole of the north
and west of Europe. The tin mines are still called “ stannaries ”
(from stannum, the Latin word for tin), and were at a very early
period granted privileges and placed under regulations by the Crown.
According to Camden, King John, who was Ear! of Cornwall before
his accession to the throne, gave the earldom, with its privileges, to
his second son, Richard, who derived from the stannaries in royalty
and fines an annual income of 200 marks, equal to about £20,000 of
696 PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE.

our money. “ Great revenues,” says the foregoing authority, “ were
drawn from the same source by the Dukes of Cornwall (beginning
with the Black Prince); the royalty in the Middle Ages being as
much as 40s. (equal to over £30 of our money), for every thousand
pounds weight of dressed tin brought into the market.” Atl tin had
to be brought to certain specified towns to pass the Stannary courts,
and there be stamped with the mark of the Duchy and the dues paid.
After which, according to Mr. Welch, the guilds of the mines could
sell to whom they pleased, except that the King or the duke had the
right of preemption at the market price. Later the Pewterers’ Com-
pany of London obtained the right to purchase one-fourth of all the
tin brought to London for sale. The tin miners and, in fact, all con-
nected with the industry at the mines were subject only to their own
stannary courts of law (except in capital cases), and had even their
own prison at their headquarters at Lostwithiel. Generally speak-
ing, the royalties and dues were farmed. It must be understood, too,
that whereas in other parts of the United Kingdom only the gold and
silver were reserved to the Crown, the tin of Cornwall and Devon
has always been the property of the King whoever may have been
the owner of the soil. It is a peculiar institution, therefore, of Corn-
wall and Devon that, on lands not under cultivation, anyone on com-
plying with the necessary formalities can mine for tin on condition
of paying the royal dues and one-fifteenth to the landowner. The
last assembly of the stannaries was held in 1752.

In common with all the other crafts carried on in the towns, that of
the pewterer was doubtless bound by some sort of fraternity or asso-
ciation in the early middle ages, but the first formal institution of a
guild was in the reign of Edward III, A. D. 1348. The ordinances
for the government of this body were drawn up by its members and
submitted to the lord mayor and aldermen, and by them approved.
The records of the Craft of Pewterers thus commenced are more or
less continuous from the establishment of the still existing Pewterers’
Company in the reign of Edward IV, A. D. 1478, and are the material
from which Mr. Welch has compiled his interesting history of the
Pewterers’ Company, published two years ago. These records, too,
are not only interesting as a history of the guild, but afford a mass
of information as to its relations to the general body of the citizens
and the government of London in medieval times. The earliest rules
for controlling the craft provide for the assay of all wares and for
experts superintending the same. Anyone selling pewter before it
passed the proper test, was condemned to forfeit the goods. Still,
contrary to the general belief as to custom in such matters, the regula-
tions do not appear to limit the ranks of the workmen to those who
duly passed through a formal apprenticeship, but stipulated that
either such (or otherwise competent men) should be employed. An

incidental commentary on the primitive lighting arrangements of
the time is contained in the rule that no work is to be done at night,
and it is easy to understand that work produced under the flare of a
rough flambeau, or, on the other hand, by the meager light of a tallow
randle, was not likely to enhance the reputation of the craft. As
just mentioned, the penalties for bad workmanship, or for inferior
quality of metal, were forfeiture of the articles and fines; suspension
from membership was also inflicted in some cases, and for very bad
or often-repeated offenses, expulsion. This last practically amounted
almost to outlawry, for unless the offending member were readmitted
it deprived him of his livelihood; since, if not a member, he could
neither buy nor sell nor be employed. No master was to employ a
workman without a character from the last employer, nor was he,
under any circumstances, to entice away another’s workman.

The qualities of pewter were also prescribed to prevent adultera-
tion and inferior quality of metal being used. These regulations
were always strictly enforced, and the control of the guild over the
trade was fostered by the Crown and Parhament for many ages, its
effect being to set up a very high standard of quality, both of mate.
rial and workmanship, and thus maintain the excellent reputation
of English pewter, besides insisting on a code of commercial morality
which could not but have a great effect on the members as citizens.

The craft at this time consisted of three grades: The livery, or
brethren, from whom were elected the wardens and other officers of
the craft; the freemen, or yeomanry, members who had obtained
license to set up in business for themselves, and the covenant men
(journeymen) and apprentices. One of the rules most strictly en-
forced was that no members were allowed to go to law with one
another, all disputes having to be submitted for decision to the
warden and craft, thus keeping in view the idea of brotherhood in
the society.

These ordinances, it must be remembered, were promulgated by
the body called the Craft of Pewterers; and although there was
doubtless a fraternity of workmen prior to this, and probably dating
from quite early times, the regulations in question, having now been
ratified by the lawful government of the city, first put the control
of the trade on a legitimate basis. It must also be remarked that
such control, though absolute, was not despotic, an appeal always
lying to the lord mayor and aldermen in cases of injustice and
oppression. In fact, not only under the Craft of Pewterers, but
afterwards under the duly chartered Pewterers’ Company, the city
fathers often interfered in case of an arbitrary exercise of power,
without any appeal to them having been lodged. With all the
faults of the paternal government of trade during the middle ages
the spirit of ‘the guilds was distinctly democratic, and such regula-
698 PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE.

tions were recognized as existing for the benefit of all. The records
show, indeed, in a very striking manner the absence of privilege and
mere influence, the very master or wardens of the company, in their
capacity of craftsmen and dealers, sometimes falling under its
discipline.

During the hundred and thirty years which elapsed between the
formation of the old body of the Craft of Pewterers and the incor-
poration of the Pewterers’ Company the guild had no hall, but
rented premises for their feasts and business meetings from the
House of the Austin Friars. Special religious services were ob-
served by the brethren at Christmas, Easter, and the Feast of the
Assumption, generally at the Church of the Grey Friars. The ex- '
pansion of trade and the consequent increase of wealth and influence
of the city of London generally during the fifteenth century doubt-
less excited the ambition of the craft for incorporation as a regular
city company, and after delays, probably due to the disturbed state
of the government through the Wars of the Roses, a charter was
granted by King Edward IV in 1473 creating the existing Pewterers’
Company. This charter is still preserved in the archives of the
guild, and is a beautifully written and illuminated document in
Latin. The powers already de facto possessed by the craft were
by this instrument confirmed and extended, one of the most valuable
new concessions being that of the right of search for inferior goods
and metal below the proper standard of purity. This right not
only was to extend over London and its suburbs, but over the whole
country, and all provincial mayors and sheriffs were enjoined to
assist the company’s officers in the work. AI] such inferior goods or
metal was to be seized and sold, the proceeds to be divided between
the company and the Crown. These searches, besides fulfilling the
primary object of protecting the trade against fraud and bad work,
had the result of greatly strengthening the company’s importance,
and consequently attracting numbers of provincial pewterers into
its ranks. The officers of the company who undertook the country
searches were accustomed to entertain the provincial master pew-
terers while on circuit at the expense of the guild, and the country
members when in town also enjoyed the hospitality of the city.
Hawking goods by peddlers at fairs or markets was strictly forbid-
den, under pain of fines and confiscation of the articles, the shop-
keepers, who of course were at the charge of rent, taxes, and other
dues, claiming and enforcing the privilege of keeping the trade in
their own hands.

Soon after the establishment of the company and its consequent
expansion the need began to be felt for a hall of its own, and accord-
ingly a site was found for the same in Lime street, where the present
hall now stands. From very early times it had been the custom for
PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE. 699

the wardens to purchase large quantities of tin from the stannaries in
bulk and to retail the-same at a small profit to the members, a plan
doubtless advantageous to all parties, as the profit was apphed to the
payment of the general expenses of the guild. During the building
of the hall, however, which necessarily caused a great drain on their
resources, this practice was discontinued, but was resumed on the com-
pletion of the work. Part of the site was occupied by tenements built
at the same time by the company, and the rents of these and sums
received for the hire of the hall for wedding parties appear to have
materially increased its income.

In 1504 a statute of the Parliament of King Henry VII abrogated
the right of any guild or company to make ordinances without the
same having received the assent of the chancellor, treasurer, or other
officers of the realm, and at the same time rendered illegal the partic-
ular by-law which forbade members of such a fraternity from suing
one another in the King’s courts. In the same Parliament an act was
passed in the interest of the pewterers to suppress hawking by ped-
dlers, the adulteration of metal, and the use of false scales and
weights. This statute was confirmed in the fourth year of the reign
of Henry VIII.

In accordance with the first-named act of 1504, the ordinances of
the company were, after eighteen years’ delay, submitted to the King
for confirmation in 1522, and duly assented to after the usual presents
and gratifications to courtiers and ministers. About this time the
importation of foreign pewter was seriously competing with the
English trade, and after a considerable amount of lobbying and
bribery in Parliament an act was passed in 1533 totally prohibiting
the importation of foreign pewter, any so smuggled to be forfeited,
together with a fine to the amount of the value. The right of search
was again confirmed, and no foreigner was to be employed in the
trade under any circumstances and under heavy penalties, and no per-
son of foreign birth to be apprenticed. It was also forbidden for an
Englishman to exercise the craft anywhere beyond sea, and thereby
teach it to foreigners. Hawking was again forbidden, even when
exercised by duly qualified pewterers, none to be sold except in a shop
attached to a dwelling house, or in open fairs and markets. It is
curious to note here that the Pewterers’ Company republished these
acts in a book form so late as 1741.

As an instance of the tight hold kept by the company on its mem-
bers, it may be mentioned that at a court held in March, 1559, it was
decreed that Robert West should bring his wife upon Friday next
to “ reconcile herself to Mr. Cacher and others of the company for her
naughty misdemeanor of her tongue toward them.”

No man was allowed to set up in business without first submitting
to the master ‘and wardens a specimen of his work. In case of dis-
TOU PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE.

putes between members of the guild, it was often decided that the one
of the litigants held to be in the wrorg should invite the other
with his wife to supper, “and then to be merry together and so
to be lovers and friends henceforth.”

A very high standard of commercial morality was enforced. For
instance, no pewterer was allowed, under a penalty of a fine of 20s.
(probably equal to £10 of our money) to say to a prospective cus-
tomer that his goods were superior in quality to those of others.

The following is a specimen of the amenities obtaining at the time
between the English and those of the sister kingdom: * Thomas
Wolshire shall pay for his opprobrious words toward Richard Scot,
saying ‘ He played the Scot’s part and had the Scot’s heart,’ 16d.”
Members had to attend the funerals of their confreres on pain of
fine, unless they had a reasonable excuse.

Not only apprentices, but unmarried journeymen lived in their
master’s house and accompanied him to church on Sundays. They
were not to absent themselves until after the afternoon service, when
they were permitted to amuse themselves with shooting at the butts
and dancing. On the other hand, the company was resolute to
defend the rights of members, and once, for example, forbade any
of the craft from serving any persons belonging to the Saddlers’
Company until a claim against it by a pewterer had been satisfied.
Adulteration of metal, as before mentioned, was severely punished.
sometimes by expulsion, the culprit being described as acting con-
trary to his oath and “like no trewe pewterer and to the great
slaundre of all the pewterers in London.” Sometimes on giving
an undertaking and a surety not to repeat the offense he was received
back, but was made to pay a substantial fine. In cases when the
offense was not very flagrant the punishment was to make the culprit
change his mark, this being equivalent to a fine, in consequence of
the loss of time and the expense of re-marking his stock and oblit-
erating his old mark.

The statute of apprentices having been passed in 1563, the com-
pany, in 1564, issued an ordinance that each member of the livery
should be allowed to take one apprentice, the master and wardens
might have three, but only on condition that they employed two
journeymen. Misbehaving apprentices were sometimes sentenced
to be whipped in the hall. No member was allowed to sell old pew-
ter bought secondhand, and no pewterer was to act as seullion even
for the lord mayor himself, nor to repair or clean pewter except at
his own workshop—a suggestive rule for maintaining the dignity
of the craft. Gilding pewter was strictly forbidden, except when
given as a present to friends. To insure proper registration, the

members of the livery were accustomed to set up their marks in the

hall.
PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE. 701

Tt was a custom coexistent with the company for members to be
enrolled who were not pewterers. An instance that may be given
is-that of one Isaac Tucker, who, in the year 1556, was admitted
on the recommendation of “Sir Water Rawghley” (sic) on pay-
ment of £10, half of the usual fee payable by such members. It is
expressly stated that this was done out of respect to “Sir Water,”
and for no other reason.

No journeyman was allowed to trade on his own account, but must
obtain the permit of the company and register his mark or “ touch,”
as it was technically called, and if a tradesman left London and
afterwards returned he had to pay his dues for permission to start
a second time. No tin was to be exported, except after having
passed through the pewterer’s hands—that is, in bars or made into
pewter ingots.

In the last year of Elizabeth’s reign it was forbidden to allow
country pewterers and others to enter sheps where London men were
at work, “ whereby they come to great hght of further knowledge: ”
in other words, were finding out trade secrets. The monopolies
granted by James I to the farmers of tin had a very prejudicial ef-
fect on the industry, and the company accordingly petitioned several
times against the practice, which, after a time, was modified by the
King. The sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth century
must have been the palmy days of the pewter trade. The pros-
perity of the middle class brought substantial comfort into the homes
of the artisan and the laborer, and every fairly well-to-do citizen,
among other belongings, seems to have made a point of possessing
his “ garnish ” of pewter, while even the thrifty workman and _ peas-
ant had a modest quantity. A “garnish,” I may here recall, con-
sisted of 12 plates, 12 smaller platters, and 12 dishes. At this
period, also, large quantities of pewter were kept in stock by mem-
bers of the trade for hire to the nobility and gentry as well as to
public bodies for banquets and other festivities, the pewterers often
helping one another with loans when a great demand was made on
their resources.

DECLINE OF THE INDUSTRY.

The causes of the decline of the pewter manufacture in England,
as on the Continent, were mainly, as before stated, the competition of
cheap earthenware for table and other domestic use, followed by
deterioration of quality and design, and consequent loss of influence
on the part of the English Pewterers’ Company. The guild had for
centuries maintained, by rigid enactments, the high quality of English
pewter, both for home consumption and for export, and these enact-
ments were enormously aided in their enforcements by the company’s
right of search. During the troubles of the great civil war, however,
702 PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE.

this right fell almost into desuetude, and after the restoration the
company found that it is much easier to maintain a privilege than to
reimpose one when once practically abrogated. The right of search
was felt to be unsuited to the spirit of even that age, and the company
never succeeded in getting it legally recognized again. Possibly, as
has been suggested, the authorities were indisposed to bring the ques-
tion before the courts of law; as, in the case of an adverse decision,
the right would definitely cease to exist, whereas by leaving the mat-
ter unsettled it might be once more established, should a favorable
opportunity arise. It is probable also that the practice which we |
have seen had existed from early times, of admitting into the fellow-
ship of the guild members who were not connected with the craft,
became more and more common, until many of the influential so-
called “ pewterers ” had ceased to possess any real business interest
in the trade, with the inevitable result that the main object of the
existence of the company was neglected.

Efforts, however, were made from time to time to revive the declin-
ing industry, but slowly and surely the products of the potteries ousted
ihe plates, dishes, and vessels of pewter, whilst the art of plating
inferior metals with silver displaced the old pewter dish covers,
cruets, salt cellars, drinking cups, and the like, until at last even in
the village inns and hostelries the electroplated tankards displaced
the pewter pot. This last fact is significant, since good judges of malt
liquor never lost the tradition that ale or stout was of better flavor
when drunk from what was called “its native pewter.” Thus the
once flourishing craft of the pewterer degenerated to the production
of some few mere utilities, such as lavatory fittings, public house bar
appliances, and plumbers’ requisites. Although exclusive reference
has been made to English pewter, we must not forget that the pew-
terers’ craft embraced Scotland, notably Edinburgh, as demonstrated
by the “ Tappit Hen ” and “ Christening Tankard,” which examples
by the courtesy of Mr. Walter Churcher are, with others from his
collection, here for our inspection this evening.

MARKS.

Great numbers of old touches or makers’ marks have come down
to us, but it is, unfortunately, the fact that no register of them exists,
and unless the name is mentioned they are, therefore, difficult to
identify. Much interesting information from the collector’s point of
view has been written on the subject of marks, but it will suffice for
the purpose of this paper to say that no piece of pewter was allowed
to be sold without a mark, and that this rule extended to the pewter
mountings on stone jugs and tankards; and it is thought probable
that the crowned “ Rose” mark was in some measure the official
“touch ” of the Pewterers’ Company, being one of their armorials,

while the double “f” was a penal mark sometimes affixed to the
work of a member who had been found guilty of malpractices, and
signifying, as it did, false, the result commonly was his being obliged
to join the ranks of the journeymen of the craft.

ALLOYS.

And now I must refer to the alloys and the process of acttial manu-
facture. It is still questionable, I believe, what were the precise alloys
and the relative proportions used in the manufacture of ancient pew-
ter; and, indeed, down to our own day the word “ pewter ” has an elas-
tic meaning. I gather, however, that some among the old examples
show a large admixture of lead, as, for instance, a vase handle of the
fourth century of our era, dug up in Rome, which, according to
Bapst, was assayed in France early in the last century and found to
contain about three-sevenths lead, without any trace of copper. This
must, therefore, be considered as of very inferior quality. By way
of explanation it has been suggested, indeed, that tin procured with
difficulty from a remote and barbarous region was almost as dear as
silver, and that this may account for the low grade of pewter being
in use in Rome. On the other hand, however, Mr. Gowland’s analy-
sis of varying examples of Roman pewter show that the question of
cost was by no means invariably considered. His results give for
what he terms “typical” Roman pewter: 72.86 tin to 26.90 lead,
and 70.58 tin to 27.62 lead; that is, to put it roughly, three parts tin
and one part lead.

According to Mr. Welch, in the ordinances of the old English craft
of pewterers two qualities of pewter are described, the first of tin
with a small admixture (supposed to be about 5 per cent) of what is
called “kettle brass,” otherwise known as “ peak” metal, the peak
metal being a compound of copper with some other metal not defi-
nitely ascertained, and probably always kept a mystery of the guild.
The second quality was originally called “ vessel of tin,” being a com-
pound of tin and lead in the proportion of 1 hundredweight of tin
to not exceeding 26 pounds of lead. This alloy was afterwards
known as “ lay,” or lead, metal.

Some old pieces of the Elizabethan and Stuart periods were
assayed two years ago by my friend, Mr. Haseler, when conducting
some experiments on behalf of Liberty & Co., and besides tin he
found them to consist of small quantities of copper, with traces of
antimony, the latter probably being added for the hardening and
cleansing of the other metals. These pieces were of what is known
as the old first quality of pewter. We have seen that the craft
always guarded most jealously the good reputation which the Eng-
lish pewter held, and that it included the keeping up of the requisite
standard of purity in the metal. It was for this purpose, indeed,
704 PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE.

that the Pewterers’ Company possessed and exercised their peculiar
powers. Thus, as has been noted, all tin brought to London was
Hable to be assayed by the company’s inspector before being sold,
and it could be seized and forfeited if of inferior quality, no matter
io whom it might belong. It was also ordered (in 1438) that all
articles (in accord with a published list) should be of a certain
standard weight, thus insuring to purchasers a definite quantity of
the metal. This was doubtless an excellent rule to prevent fraud
when recasting was so constantly resorted to in order to make good
the constant wear and tear to which pewter articles were lable at
a time when they were used for practically all domestic purposes.
Thus, it was a definite rule that “ chargeours” of the largest size
were to weigh three-fourths hundredweight per dozen, 1. e., 7 pounds
each, and small “ bolles ” 13 pounds per dozen.

Yn the present day and of late years many experiments have been
made and various modifications have been tried in the composition of
pewter, nearly every manufacturer having his own particular for-
mula. For the production of modern pewter goods aspiring to be
classed as artistic in design, the inferior alloy containing lead is dis-
carded altogether (except by the Japanese in the manufacture of
their antimony ware). And to avoid as far as possible the use of
copper, which some consider to have a bad effect on the color, tin is
nowadays alloyed in the proportion of about 5 per cent of antimony,
or bismuth, or both. An excess of copper imparts a brownish tint,
whilst the use of lead (always be it remembered the alloy of the
so-called second quality pewter) imparts the well-known gray color
tone which, be it acknowledged, has for some of us a decided charm.
Still, as we know, if lead is used beyond a certain proportion it ren-
ders the pewter dangerous for the use of liquors containing acids,
such as beer, wine, vinegar, etc., by reason of the chemical action they
set up, the excess lead producing poisonous oxides.

A series of experiments were made some years ago under the
auspices of the French Government, which resulted in a law being
passed prescribing the proportion of lead which may safely be used,
and this was fixed for France at 164 per cent. The old pewterers
appear to have had one advantage over the modern in the fact that
their lead nearly always contained a small percentage of silver,
which (unfortunately for the pewter trade) science has enabled the
modern smelters to extract. ‘That is to say, the fascinating luster
which many old pieces of pewter possess is generally ascribed to the
presence of this small proportion of silver in alloy. Modern German
pewter, as compared with modern English, contains a much larger
proportion of antimony, with some bismuth, and gives out when bent,
or bitten (which the modern English does in a far less degree) the
well-known distinguishing crackle or cri, Modern German pewter

is produced principally in Nuremburg, Crefeld, and Munich. The
German alloys have, in my opinion, however, the disadvantage of
being more brittle than those used in this country, and I refer par-
ticularly to those used by the company with which my own name is
associated. The alloys used by it are, as before mentioned, the results
of careful trials made by my friend, Mr. Haseler, a partner in and
director of Liberty & Co.’s works at Birmingham. His endeavor has
been to reproduce a metal similar, as far as possible, to the best of the
old English pewter, and in point of solidity the new alloy is, I
believe, unequaled. The exact constituents and proportions used are
regarded as a trade secret by my colleagues, as is the case with the
composition of the alloy used by our German friends, although both
could, doubtless, be readily assayed.

MANUFACTURE.

Pewter work is either cast, spun, or hammered, and the methods
of manufacture differ in no essential in the present day from those
of the olden times. Most of the old pewter was cast in molds of
brass, which were highly finished inside and fitted with great nicety.
But specially prepared iron is preferred nowadays, as higher skill
in the working of the more enduring metal has been attained.
Pewter can be cast of any degree of thinness, and is turned out of the
mold in a state requiring a minimum of work in the finishing pro-
cess, apart from the inevitable polishing and soldering. In the
active days of the Pewterers’ Company the guild was accustomed to
purchase and to have made to order a large number of molds, which
were let out on hire to its members. The latter, of course, also pos-
sessed stocks of molds of their own, often held in shares by different
tradesmen. The reason for this arrangement was the great expense
of producing properly made molds, and by this means the expense
was shared by members to mutual advantage. The elaborate pieces,
inerusted with ornament in relief, produced on the Continent during
the Renaissance, especially in the sixteenth century, were cast in a
different way, 1. e., in sand, and in sections afterwards soldered to-
gether. These pieces, being produced in small quantities, the cost
of a metal mold would have been prohibitive, since even for plainer
work it was necessary to spread the cost of a mold over a great num-
ber of articles. The articles being cast in sand, however, left a
finely granulated surface, requiring a considerable amount of extra
labor to finish them by polishing and chasing.

One of the most satisfactory pieces of old English pewter, and per-
haps the example most frequently referred to, is a large dish in the
South Kensington Museum, of which, by the courtesy of Sir Caspar
Purdon Clarke, I have been enabled to bring a sketch here to-night.

sm 1904——+415
706 PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE.

It will be seen that it is engraved with the royal arms and a floral
border of simple design, and bears an inscription dated 1662. The
engraving on it is plainly but boldly executed, and has the great
merit of obtaining that too often ignored quality, namely, suitability.
But, as we have seen, the quality of English pewter, as far as regards
the metal employed, was always unrivaled, and the strength and ex-
cellence of the workmanship was also equal to the best. In the de-
partment of design, however, we have nothing to show in old pewter
to compare in elaboration with some of the pieces still existing, the
work of continental craftsmen. I greatly prefer, however, the taste
of our own workmen, who made their platters and bowls almost al-
ways plain (and, therefore, more easily cleaned), depending on the
shapes alone for the good effect of the cups, tankards, and measures.
The shapes of our old craftsmen’s hollow ware are almost always ex-
cellent and generally far superior to the classical ewers and vessels
produced by the Frenchmen of the Renaissance. Our rivals on the
Continent, indeed, appear to have made the great mistake throughout
of overelaboration (for pewter is essentially a homely metal), with
the inevitable result of subordination of shape to ornament. Some
of the ewers and other vessels made by Briot, who has been called
the Cellini of the pewterers, are, however, dignified, in addition to
being elaborate. But too many of the show pieces in the museums
and private collections by German makers of the Renaissance period
are both inferior in execution and absurdly overdone in decoration.

The solder used is still the hard solder of the middle ages, made of
tin and lead, sometimes with a small proportion of bismuth, and
when skillfully done the process insures not only mechanical adhe-
sion, but forms an alloy of itself between the solder and the metals
joined. The old pewterers strictly forbade the use of soft solder (1. e..
solder with too much lead) ; and although handles of jugs, ete., and
the ears of dishes were at one time soldered an ordinance made in
the reign of Elizabeth decreed that in future they were to be cast in
one piece. Modern hollow ware is often “ spun,” as it 1s technically
called, very much in the same way as clay on a potter’s wheel. The
metal is forced into the shape required by a blunt steel tool onto a
wooden “ chuck,” or block, of the shape of the vessel to.be made, and
much of the ornament is worked by hand with the hammer and
chaser. Some pieces are entirely hammered up from the sheets of
pewter, and therefore bear the impress of individuality to a more
marked degree.

THE REVIVAL.

T now come to the concluding and the more practical side of my
subject—the revival of the pewterer’s craft as an art industry. And
here I would again allude to the notable paper on pewter read by
lod

PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE. (soir

Mr. Gardner ten years ago, and the interesting fact that no sooner
had the echoes of his words of lamentation died away than the cloud
which threatened extinction to the industry slowly lifted, and from
that day the erstwhile moribund craft has been struggling back to
life. Among the controlling influences tending toward this result a
certain firm, whose name I need not mention, had, shortly after that
time, adopted for designs in silver piate and jewelry the motif
and lines of ancient Celtic ornament. The results proving fairly
satisfactory, the question arose, Why not apply the lke forms and
designs to the manufacture of pewter? Thus, rightly or wrongly,
the pioneers of the revival of Celtic ornament decided to work in
pewter on somewhat parallel lines with silver, and came to the con-
clusion that nothing is produced by the silversmith which may not,
as occasion arises, be made in pewter, but with the distinct proviso
that any attempt to imitate the precious metal should be avoided.
For pewter, however, only modifications of Celtic forms were used,
and these were soon supplemented by floral and plant motives to
which the distinguishing name of “ Tudric” was given. This modest
effort was, at all events, the first step toward the reawakening of the
pewter industry, and up to the present it remains the only effort
that has been made in England. It attained some commercial suc-
cess, and, directly and indirectly, it has been the means of the revival,
so far as a revival has at present progressed. But the ideal of
modern English pewter, as conceived by its sponsors, aims at more
than a commercial suecess—it aims at a high standard in design, a
high standard in workmanship, and a high standard in the quality
of the metal, and it strives to avoid overmodeling and overchasing.
It would devote attention to shapes being properly adapted to the
several purposes for which the objects are made, it would see that the
constructive lines be graceful, well contrasted, and strong, and that
ornament, when used at all, be used with restraint, and grow out of
the general design. These excellent intentions, unfortunately, are
not always carried out, for faulty and eecentric notes strike out from
time to time. These, however, it is confidently believed, are mere
accidents by the way, and will doubtless become less and less fre-
quent. The Germans are, practically, the only Continental repre-
sentatives of the modern pewter industry, and they, having observed
the new note struck in England, appear to have seized upon the fact
that a change in the fashion of their own wares was desirable. So,
forthwith, they proceeded to produce what they conceived to be an
improvement upon the English work, and translated it into the
fantastic motif which it pleases our Continental friends to worship
as Vart nouveau. Still, alongside the foolish and undesirable, it
inust in justice be admitted that the Germans have recently produced
many original:and pleasing designs in pewter. I allude, particular-y
708 PEWTER AND THE REVIVAL OF ITS USE.

to the work of Messrs. J. P. Kayser & Sons, Messrs. Walters Scherf
& Co., and Messrs. Lichtinger & Co. The present aim of the German
pewterers seems to make for rather different results in certain details
than with our designers, the ornament being made sharper and
higher in relief, and the excess of antimony, or some similar alloy,
used enables them to execute this kind of casting with great facility.
As compared with goods made in this country the surface manipula-
tion and finish of German goods is often more careful and _ satis-
factory. On the other hand, our alloys are much less brittle, our
work flatter and broader in treatment, and thus, it will, I think, be
found that our designs and methods are more suitable to the capa-
bilities of the metal, and are therefore better calculated to per-
manently advance the pewter industry.

As for the lines on which to advance, it should be remembered
that for historic mansions and houses where the apartments are
furnished after the style of the Renaissance, and wherever magnifi-
cence is fitting and desired, a rich and sumptuous array of costly
silver plate is doubtless in harmony with its surroundings; but for
the majority of households I venture to think that pewter is equally
desirable for the many decorative adjuncts of refined and restful
furnishing, and the more particularly as it can be obtained at modest
cost. On this latter point we are continually being told that objects
of art should net be regarded as luxuries, but should be easily attain-
able by rich and poor alike. Everything, therefore, which tends
toward the production of useful and beautiful objects at prices
within the reach of all classes should be welcomed. And _ herein,
perchance, in these days of culture, are to be found the future possi-
bilities of pewter, for its soft neutral tone and subdued luster har-
monizes with any scheme of decorative coloring. Those, too, who
object to the use of electroplate as an imitation of silver may be
content to accept equally good forms in solid pewter in its place,
while those who are already the fortunate possessors of treasures
in pewter may contemplate with equanimity the advent of the
burglar.

The manufacturer, however, realizes that as by a process of
natural evolution pewter has ousted wood from the kitchen, so china
in its turn has inevitably supplanted pewter. The fact must be
squarely faced by him, therefore, that it is useless to reproduce the
large majority of those many fascinating forms in old pewter, where
the purposes which brought them into being are now attaimed by
the substitution of other and more appropriate wares. For instance,
however beautiful their form and patina, it would be absolutely
useless to tempt a modern housewife to purchase pewter plates and
vessels for tea and table use, now that spotless and dainty white

porcelain cups and dishes are obtainable at equal or less cost. A
recent author tells us, indeed, that “it is a good thing to rub pewter
over with a rag saturated with vaseline,” but surely the process
appeals to the palate as the reverse of appetizing, and is calculated
further to emphasize the housewife’s objection to pewter for culin-
ary and table use. Then, too, besides the wares made for the service
of food and other purposes requiring easy and perfect cleansing
there is a quite considerable range of other things once made in
pewter, which an altered state of conditions has rendered useless.
These also are undesirable for the modern pewterer to reproduce.
The author just quoted writes, however, in reference to some of
them: “Among other instances of articles in pewter which have
now unfortunately ceased to be made are snuffboxes, candle boxes,
table fountains, and lavabos, or hanging washstands.” Now, while
sympathizing with collectors in regretting the disappearance of the
good work of bygone days, it would be a more helpful attitude for
the manufacturer to try to substitute useful objects for the useless
ones. Instead of table fountains and candle boxes one might sug-
gest the production of electroliers, jJardinieres, and presentation
caskets, challenge cups, card trays, and a host of et ceeteras of the
flower vase order. We have, indeed, an example of how a similar
evolution was brought about by the Japanese metal workers, who,
when they found that sword hilts and their inlaying were no longer
required, transferred their attention to the invention of the cheap
and clever antimony ware with which they have since flooded the
European markets. And this antimony ware, be it remembered, is a
branch of the pewterer’s trade.

And now we come to the two questions which T have been working
up to, i.e. (4) are the pewter wares now being made equal in quality
and design to the average work of the best periods of bygone days?
and (ii) what are the future prospects of pewter as an art industry /

The latest eritic on this subject, the writer just referred to, has
not one good word for modern pewter. He says:

In striving to arrive at “art” pewter the manufacturers have produced the
wrong kind of alloy. It is far too crude and white, and has a meretricious
look, besides the fatal fault of almost looking like silver or electroplate.
Another fault is that it is far too brittle and hard. There is no nice feeling
in it; it is, unlike old pewter, hard and repulsive to the touch. Again, * * #*
satisfactory designs for pewter can not be extemporized by any designer, how-
eyer cunning he may be at catching the public taste, so called, with a gaudy
cretonne or a meaningless wall paper.

Happily, it is needless to add, there are many who hold more hope-
ful views on this subject, who consider a distinct advance has been
mode already, and who believe that there is good promise for the
future.

DISCUSSION.

The chairman, in moving the vote of thanks to the author, said:

The charm of art was never so close, intimate, and grateful as when it was
conferred on the familiar articles of utility about our hearths and homes. Its
charm infinitely transcends in vaJue the prices of the materials on which it
is lavished, and can be equally imparted to the costliest substances—black
ebony and white ivory, silver and gold, and precious stones—and to compara-
tively worthless substances—clay, iron, copper, tin, brass, and pewter, and ordi-
nary woods—provided the artistic manipulation of them is sympathetically
adapted to the distinguishing natural qualities—and the defects of the same—
of these materials and to the uses the ‘objets d'art”? fashioned of them are
intended to fulfil. Just ten years ago Mr. J. Starkie Gardner gave us his
scholarly paper (Journal, June 1, 1904) on “ Pewter,” and in it, as Mr. Lasenby
Liberty has told us, expressed a regret that pewter had not shared up to that
date in the great artistic renaissance of the reign of Queen Victoria. This
observation was at once taken up by Kayser, and by Lichtinger in Germany,
and in this country also by Mr. Lasenby Liberty, who for the past ten years
has devoted himself, with the enthusiasm and resolution with which he pur-
sues all his artistic enterprises, to the resuscitation of the ancient and once
flourishing and famous British art of pewtery. Mr. Lasenby Liberty to-night
has fully and clearly, and in the spirit of the most impartial criticism, told us
of all that has been attempted and done in this respect by his firm, and from the
specimens of their work placed before us and the illustrations of them in his
lantern slides we can judge of the difficulties of the undertaking to which Mr.
Lasenby Liberty has set himself as a labor of love and of the measure of suc-
cess with which these difficulties have been overcome. What is required of all
such articles is that while artistic they should never lose their utilitarian and
homely character—that is, the character impressed upon them through untold
generations of rough and ready domestic service. If this character is overlooked
or ignored, or in any way blurred or masked, either in the form or the embellish-
ments of these articles, if, indeed, it is not directly indicated and emphasized by
their artistic treatment, the art elaborated on them has been wasted and is
worthless, however unencumbered by purposeless conventionalities and unsig-
nificant symbols or however original in conception and sincere in execution. The
“summam alicui rei dare”? to achieve here is directness, simplicty, and balance
of form, the subordination of any ornamentation to the form and to the interpre-
tation of its function, and the perfect adjustment of both form and ornamen-
tation to the materials of which these articles are severally framed and to the
human purposes they have to subserve. The decoration must not only be
responsive to form and use, but as reticent as it is significant, and must avoid
all excess. There must be no straining after originality, which, unless it comes
of the rarest and richest genius, tends to languish under weak hands into nerve-
less and contemptible affectations and conceits and in strong ones to. run riot
in violent and offensive eccentricities. In France the contortionists of Vart
nouveau haye reached the basest artistic degradation in the studied pruriency
of the nude decorative bronzettes with which the shop windows of all Europe
have been crowded during the past three or four years. Compare them for a
moment with the exquisite modeling and the purity of conception which is their
animating soul, of the clay figurines of the coroplasts of ancient Tanagra and
Thisbe, Cyme, and Myrina and you at once realize the gulf fixed between the
inspirations of artistic genius and the diabolical subtleties of merely manipula-
tive dexterity, There is, moreover, nothing new in this art nouveau, It is, in

and which in our time has been brought into vogue by the marvelous black and
white drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, a man of undoubted genius, but who, it
should always be remembered, received his artistic training as an architectural
draftsman, and again by the seductive jewelry of Lalique and cameo cut glass
of Gallé. But at its best it is not of true artistic inspiration, but an intel-
lectually conceived and calculated mannerism, foredoomed in the hands of
mediocrities to the fate of all mechanical imitations. Truly artistic decoration
in its whole scheme and in every detail is ever as spontaneous and free as the
beauty and grace and sweetness of the “all a-blowin’, all a-growin’” flowers of
the Thames side meadows of a morning in May.

CAMEOS.
By Cyrit Davenport, F. S. A.

The word “cameo” does not in any way help toward a proper
understanding of the term. The real derivation of the word is
unknown. As we now understand them, cameos may be defined as
small bas-reliefs cut upon some substance precious because of its
‘arity, beauty, or hardness.

The earliest examples of the art are perhaps to be found in the
scarabs of ancient Egypt, combining both the cameo and intaglio, as
their bases are engraved with designs. Early instances also exist in
the form of small sculptures on the back of seal stones, of Greek
and Etruscan origin, as also rarely in Mycenean work. Glass cameos
were probably made at Rome long before the Christian era, and of
still earlier date are found small rosettes and medallions of clay
impressed with designs in relief and gilded.

The ancient Egyptian scarabeei are usually made in some soft
stone, steatite, syenite, or serpentine, all of which can be cut by flint
or obsidian flakes, or even by hard metal chisels. But harder stones
were sometimes successfully cut, examples being found in amethyst,
sarnelian, obsidian, and jasper. The majority appear to have been
made in molded glass or porcelain, usually with a green or blue glaze.

About the third century B. C. the peculiar adaptability of the
banded onyx for cameo work was first generally realized, and 14
‘rapidly became the favorite material in which the most skilled
artists worked; and cameos in time became valued articles of per-
sonal adornment, increasing in favor in proportion as the use of
seal rings declmed.

Onyx, which is a silicious chalcedony, is usually formed in irregu-
lar hollows in trap rock, and is deposited gradually in successive
layers from the outer contours toward the center, alternately crystal-
line and amorphous. The crystalline layers are white in reflected

714 CAMEOS.

light, the amorphous are translucent, grayish, and curiously per-
meable by liquids. In consequence of their permeability certain
colors are sometimes naturally acquired by the amorphous layers of
chalcedony. In cases where the water of infiltration is loaded with
iron a yellowish red will probably be found, producing what is
‘alled a sardonyx, from a Persian word “ zard,” meaning yellow.
Other metals will impart other tints.

Pliny (first century), in his Natural History, among other notes
concerning jewels, says that (Book xxxvir) in his hands are
books “ wherein it is deciphered how to sophisticate transparent
gems,” a statement which likely enough refers to artificial coloring
of chalcedony. But at the same time it may also only mean the
paste imitations which were plentifully made both before and dur-
ing the time the Natural History was written.

It is, I think, probably due to the discovery of the remarkable
adaptability of the onyx stone for cameo work that the art has
developed so as to become one of a considerable range and consider-
able importance both from the antiquarian and the artistic point
of view.

Without this discovery we should not have possessed the Strozzi
Augustus of the British Museum, or the Portland vase, or any of
the works like them, bearing designs cut in one colored layer on a
background of another, but we might have had the vase of St.
Martin cut simply in an agate without any reference to the trend of
its color layers, and the phalerae in chalcedony or amethyst, or any
other stone of one color. But without the onyx cameos it is likely
enough that all the rest would never have been considered more than
small and delicate pieces of sculpture, not belonging to a school o
their own, so that for the existence of cameos as a distinct branch
of art we are probably indebted particularly to that unknown
lapidary who first hit upon the idea of cutting the banded onyx
parallel to its color layers instead of across them.

At Oberstein, in Oldenburg, there is a large onyx industry, origi-
nally fixed there because the stone was found plentifully in the
neighborhood, but this supply having now become comparatively
small, onyxes are sent there in quantities from India, Brazil, or
Egypt to be sliced up ready for cutting, shaped, and artificially
stained with colors as may be desirable.

The staining of onyx is well understood and is now reduced almost
to a certainty, so that it is said that any ancient and presumably
natural tint can be artificially produced with great accuracy :

Reds by means of pernitrate of iron.

Black by oil, honey, or sugar.

Blues by iron with ferrocvanide of potassium (prussian blue).

Greens by nitrate of nickel.

Heat alone will often darken and improve the color of an onyx.

Sulphuric acid will often improve the color of an onyx when
metallic oxides already exist within it.

Nitric acid will often pale an onyx.

The white or crystalline layers are seldom meddled with. They
can only be shehtly reddened superficially by painting with a solu-
tion of iron or a little thickened by heat or strong acid.

Early carvings and engravings on hard stone were probably at
first cut with a sharp diamond splinter alone; in time the diamond
point was only used to sketch out the design on the polished surface
of the stone, the actual cutting being afterwards done more easily
and expeditiously by means of a hand drill, or some more powerful
tool analogous to the modern jeweler’s lathe. The harder stones
require the help of oil and diamond dust to cut them, the soft iron
points which are used becoming thickly coated with microscopic
pieces of diamond and when rapidly revolved forming a very power-
ful cutting surface.

Emery is mentioned by both Theophrastus and Pliny as being the
best material for rubbing down stones for engraving, the softer of
which. were probably sometimes engraved with flint points. Emery
will polish a diamond; it is crystallized alumina and a variety of
corundum.

For polishing ordinary stones rotten stone (powdered alumina)
or tripoli powder (powdered silica) are most generally used. For
polishing, of course, the material used must be softer than the sub-
stance to be polished, and the points used for carrying the polishing
powders are also soft, copper, ivory, or wood.

My examples are arranged in three divisions: Antique subject or
portrait cameos on small or flat stones; antique vases and cups on
nodules of onyx or cut as cameos on blue or white glass; and the
later or Renaissance cameos.

The Greeks were the most successful workers in cameo that have
existed, the few remaining specimens of their work done during the
early Ptolemaic period (third and fourth centuries B. ©.) are
unsurpassed, and the finest pieces made at Rome from the first cen-
tury B. C. to the third century A. D. were actually. the work of
Greek artists. The universal acknowledgment of the surpassing
excellence of the Greek workmen is marked in an interesting way by
the fact that the extremely skillful Renaissance cameo cutters nearly
all signed their names, if at all, in Greek characters.

Augustus Octavianus Cesar, second Emperor of Rome, who reigned
during the latter part of the first century, B. C., and the first few
years of the Christian era, was evidently not only a splendid model
for the cameo cutter, but also a man of much learning and culture

‘

and a great patron of the arts. He is said to have been the original
of Aneas as depicted by Virgil.

During the Roman Empire until the time of Constantine great
luxury prevailed, and no doubt the lavish expenditure which was
indulged in by the opulent and luxurious collectors of their time
tempted the most skilled of the Greek cameo cutters to migrate to
Rome and follow their avocations there more profitably to themselves
than they could anywhere else.

Toward the end of the third century the Greek influence began to
die out of Roman art in cut gems, and consequently there is a marked
decline in the hitherto high standard reached in their production, and
in the fourth century, when Constantine the Great moved his court
to Byzantium, “ Nova Roma” as it was sometimes called, a new style,
Christian in feeling, began, and the classical designs hitherto preva-
lent were changed as to their attributes: or superseded by others of
new character. Hercules becomes David, Perseus and the Gorgon
do duty for David and Goliath, Venus and Leda both become the
Virgin Mary, and the heads of Medusa have the snakes cut away and
are changed into the Holy face of St. Veronica. Byzantine art in
cameos is not remarkably good; it is chiefly noticeable for the skillful
manner in which advantage is taken of the natural markings of the
bloodstone.

Some ancient portrait and subject cameos are of world-wide celeb-
rity, either because of the exquisite beauty of the art displayed upon
them, or for the size and beauty of the stones in which they are cut.
The largest of these are both illustrative of scenes in the life of the
Emperor Tiberius, who succeeded Augustus; one is at Paris (13 by
11 inches) and the other at Vienna (9 by 7§ inches). M. Ernest
Bahelon thinks these may both have been cut by the celebrated en-
graver of intaghos, Dioscorides. Then there is the beautiful double
profile cameo at St. Petersburg, known as the “ Gonzaga Cameo,”
representing, perhaps, Ptolemy II, Philadelphus, King of Egypt, and
his wife, and another of the same king with his second wife, at
Vienna. Adolf Furtwaengler considers these may be portraits of
Alexander the Great and his mother Olympias. They were both
most likely made during the early Ptolemaic period.

The large double portrait cameo, formerly in the Marlborough
collection and now in the British Museum, is also one of the great
cameos of the world; it measures 8? by 6 inches, and represents an
emperor and empress facing each other, in profile, with the attributes
of Jupiter Ammon and Isis.

The most beautiful single head in a cameo is probably the portrait
of the Emperor Augustus, now in the British Museum, and formerly
in the Strozzi collection at Florence (pl. 1). It measures 5 by 34
inches, and is cut upon a most beautiful sardonyx. Another mag-
CAMEOS. reer

nificent single head, a portrait of the Emperor Claudius, measuring
71 by 5% inches, but badly broken, is in the royal collection at Windsor.

Among the Renaissance cameos, as far as I know, there is only one
of great celebrity, that is the small marriage group of Eros and
Psyche, falsely signed “‘TPY®ON EMOITET,” which was formerly
in the Marlborough collection and has now gone to America.

Besides the usual form of portrait or subject cameos so well known
to us, samples of which you have just seen, there is another class which
is important and perhaps not so well known or appreciated as 1t ought
to be. These are the vases, dishes, and cups which are cut as cameos
and made out of nodules of onyx or of blown and cut glass. There
are now but few ancient examples of this development of the art of
the cameo cutter left; most of them have succumbed to the destroy-
ing influence of time. It is said that when the Roman General Pom-
pey brought back from Egypt the treasure he had captured from
Mithridates, King of Pontus (first century B. C.), there were some
2,000 cups of carved hard stone among it. One of these is said to
exist in the “ Cup of St. Denys,” now at Paris, but it appears to me
to have the characteristics of later work. The * Tazza Farnese,” now
at Naples, and formerly in the collection of Lorenzo de Medici, is a
flat agate dish (diameter about 8 inches), magnificently cut as a
cameo, with figures probably of Egyptian divinities. It is considered
to have been made during the early Ptolemaic period, probably at
Alexandria. The “Vase of St. Martin,” now at St. Maurice
d’Agaune, in the Rhone Valley, is an onyx cup, dark, still with its
Byzantine setting; it is probably early Byzantine work, or possibly
late Roman mounted by Byzantine artists. ‘The smal] but exquisite
chalcedony vase (84 inches high) recently bequeathed to the British
Museum by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, belongs to this class.
The lip, lid, and foot are of enamelled gold, added probably in the
sixteenth century.

Besides these, which are all of the first importance, are the remark-
able works of the same kind, but executed in glass; the Portland vase,
in the British Museum, the Vase des Vendanges at Naples, and the
Auldjo vase in the British Museum. The Vase des Vendanges alone
is perfect. These are all antique, and as exquisitely worked as if
they were made of the most valuable stones. The Portland vase 1s
the finest of them. There are numerous fragments still existing of
vases of this kind which have been broken.

These glass vases are indeed glorified “ pastes,” of which numbers
were made during the time of the Roman Empire and just before it.
As a rule pastes imitated intaglios and were cast from clay molds,
and there are examples of paste cameos probably made as early as the
second century, B. C. These are rarely satisfactory because of the
difficulty of persuading the glass for the part in relief to keep to its
TAS CAMEOS.

own ground. In the case of the vases, however, the procedure has
been different, the reliefs have not been cast, as Wedgewood reliefs
are for instance, and then stuck on, neither have they been cast in one
piece with the darker glass of the ground, but the vase has been made
in the dark glass first, then dipped in white glass so as to_ be entirely
coated with it. The vase has then been treated exactly as if it was a
stone and the cameo cutter has cut the glass in the same manner as he
would an onyx. None of these cut glass vases have now a high polish,
but it is possible that they originally had, as some of the glass
placques of similar workmanship and about the same date are
polished.

After the Byzantine period until the Renaissance, 1. e., until the
fifteenth century, there is a lack of consecutive art in the direction of
‘ameo cutting. The Byzantine cameos are not remarkable for beauty
in design or execution. They are largely cut in bloodstone, the
peculiar coloration of which was peculiarly fitted for representations
of the crucifixion.

Christian designs prevailed as a rule until the end of the fifteenth
century, when the Renaissance began, and classical designs in their
turn replaced those taken from biblical sources.

The earliest great patron of cut gems of the Renaissance period was
Cardinal Bembo, afterwards Pope Paul II, who made a fine collec-
tion. He is said to have so loaded his fingers with rings set with
gems that they chilled him to death. His collection was largely
acquired by Lorenzo dei Medici, called the “ Magnificent,” who ruled
in Florence during the latter half of the fifteenth century. The re-
vival of the arts which took place in the fifteenth century is generally
considered to have been largely due to the patronage of this great
Italian. He had many of his gems engraved with his name. The
Medici collection is now dispersed chiefly between the Museums of
Naples, Florence, and Paris.

Renaissance cameos are remarkable for the technical skill displayed
upon them and the beauty of their settings. Benvenuti Cellini is
credited with two settings for cameos now at Paris. Although the
general level is high, there are no really great cameos of the Renais-
sance period. It was indeed a revival of the art only, and does not
add anything new to the existing styles. There were innumerable
imitations made of antiques, many of them most skillfully. Names
of celebrated engravers were frequently added both to inferior an-
tiques and to new gems, but cameos have fortunately not suffered
nearly so much from fraudulent imitations as their cousins, the in-
taglios.

From the sixteenth century to the present time shells have been
largely used for small cameos. It is, technically, a different art from

the cutting in hard stone, and is executed more after the fashion of a
wood carving, as the shell is comparatively soft.

Queen Elizabeth caused her portrait to be cut in cameo several
times; some of these have no doubt been executed by Julien de Fonte-
nay, called * Coldoré.”

In later times Italian artists have most notably followed the pro-
fession of cameo cutting. Flavio Sirletti, in the eighteenth century,
is said to have nearly reached the Greek perfection of technique.
Giovanni Pichler and Sirletti, too, cut some cameos with the diamond
point alone as an experiment. Jean Laurent Natter, of Nuremberg,
flourished in the same century; he was particularly successful in his
imitations of the antique, and in all probability numbers of so-called
* Greco-Roman gems” are really his work. He made a catalogue
of the Bessborough gems, afterwards part of the Marlborough collee-
tion, and he also wrote a valuable treatise on the ancient and modern
systems of engraving and cutting gems in hard stones.

Alessandro Cesati, called “ I] Greco,” was noted for his fine drafts-
manship. Madame de Pompadour learned the art of gem cutting
from the French artist, Jacques Guay, who made cameo portraits of
her, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and others. Guay could hardly
write, and it 1s supposed that the signatures in his cameos were cut by
someone else.

In the nineteenth century the decline in the popularity of cameos
has been marked; indeed, although there are several names of known
artists sometimes who have them, that of Benedetto Pistrucei alone
has reached a point of eminence. Pistrucci came here from Rome
early in the century, and eventually became chief engraver to the
royal mint. He designed the beautiful group of St. George and the
Dragon, which is still used on the reverse of some of our comms now in
circulation. He wrote an interesting autobiography, in which he
tells the story of a head of Flora, cut by himself, which was sold to
Mr. Richard Payne-Knight as an antique. Pistrucci showed his
mark on the gem, but Mr. Payne-Knight disbelieved the story.

THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE
RAILROADS.2

By A. Fock.

The division of Africa among the European powers through the
definition of spheres of influence is to-day an accomplished fact.
Nevertheless, the lines so arbitrarily traced on the map will never
constitute a barrier against any economic advances. There will be
always an industrial and commercial warfare, which will allot to
each European nation its field of action and its lines of advance into
the interior of the Dark Continent.

For, until economic supremacy is assured in a colony, political
domination is little more than a name.’ The attainment of the
former should be the sole aim of the latter; without it a government
will, so to speak, snatch the chestnuts out of the fire for the benefit of
its competitors.

The first step after the military occupation is the organization of
the civil and administrative branches; then the duty of the power is
but begun. But, above all other things, it must immediately open
up some means of communication at once sure, rapid, and economical.

The African problem at this time, therefore, resolves itself into a
question of the construction of a system of railroads. Since the con-
tinent is too compact to be opened through waterways, the only prac-
tical means of reaching the interior is by recourse to the locomotive.

Everything considered, the railroad is the peaceable but none the
less decisive force which, ably directed, will determine the industrial
and commercial supremacy in Africa. Some European countries,
more inspired that their rivals, realized this fact long ago. Taking
the lead, they have unrolled ribbons of steel toward distant inland

progress. ‘These advances have enabled the more alert nations to
acquire without opposition very favorable positions and to attain,
for the moment at least, an unquestionable advantage.

Fig. 1.—Map of Africa, showing railroads in operation and under construction.

An examination of the accompanying map (fig. 1) will show that
properly speaking there are but three railroad systems in Africa—the
Tunis-Algerian, the Egyptian, and the South African. The first
named is complete in itself. The other two will serve as bases on the
north and south for the great artery from Cairo to the Cape. As for

transverse routes, the English, German, and Portuguese roads on the
coast of the Indian Ocean, together with the Belgian, English, and
Portuguese enterprises on the South Atlantic, constitute the begin-
nings, already well developed, of two or possibly three lines of direct
communication between the east and west coasts lying below the
equator.

Finally, there are those French, English, and German railroads of
Western Africa, like those on the Red Sea, entirely independent, and
built for the purpose of connecting with navigable rivers or opening
a means of exportation for the goods of some inland country.
Among the roads in operation and already more or less connected
which are now being organized in the principal colonies are three or
four proposed transcontinental lines—one from the Mediterranean
to the Cape, and the others from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean.
The work on these is being pushed forward simultaneously from both
ends. Besides the great systems already spoken of, there are a num-
ber of isolated roads running from the coast short distances into the
interior. Entirely autonomous, each with its pecuhar object, these
little roads are built as occasion demands, and are in several territories
already at work. Such, at the beginning of the twentieth century, is
the situation in Africa with regard to railroads.¢

The first railroads established in Algeria more than thirty-five

years ago—the Algiers-Oran and the Philleville-Oran routes—were
concessions to the Compagnie Paris-Lyon-Mediterranee. Companies

exclusively Algerian were formed in 1875, and for the next sixteen or
seventeen years these companies constructed continually. But since

that time the Parliament has shown itself indisposed to grant further
appropriations and everything is at a standstill. During the last
decade three roads of purely local interest have been developed at
the expense of the national system.

The great central Algerian railroad runs parallel with the seacoast
from Tlemcen to Sidi-el-Hani, a distance of about 750 miles. At
Oran it divides into two short branches. Tunis, at the other ex-
tremity, is connected by branches with the principal ports of three
provinces. There are three inland roads, no one of which, however,
can be extended independently into the interior. Railroad construc-
tion in Algeria is practically at a standstill.

In fact France seems to be committed to what the English call a
“ masterly inactivity.” She has neglected to take advantage of the

incomparable base of operations for an advance into the interior
offered by her Mediterranean possessions, and in the possessions
themselves has contented herself with an insignificant system, the
elaboration of which is too often governed by political considera-
tions rather than those of a purely economical nature.

When the contracts are rewritten, the companies merged, the
iariff revised, and the headquarters moved from Paris to Algiers,
the work of construction in Algeria will receive a new impulse.
However it may come about, the new era will put an end to the
standstill policy and inaugurate a period of progress. The inde-
pendence in financial affairs which the colony now enjoys gives the
means of appropriating necessary money for railroads. To the
great profit and economic glory of French North Africa rational
extensions will be undertaken as the occasion arises.
THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE RAILROADS. 725

In sharp contrast with Algeria the protectorate of Tunis is work-
ing energetically to provide the regency with a number of railroads.
One company, the Bone-Guelma, has built the whole system with
the single exception of the line from Sfax to Gafsa, which was
established solely for the purpose of hauling the crude phosphates
from Metlaoui. The “old” system, as it is called, is the extension
to Tunis of the Algerian main line; the “ new ” system is made up of
coastwise lines, with three branches into the interior.

The next step will be the extension of these branches far enough
inland to make them commercial lines. Such was the intent of
the law of April 30, 1903, which authorized the Tunisian Government
to make contracts to the extent of $8,000,000. From Pont du Fahs,
a line will be run as far as Kalaat-es-Senar and then be turned
toward Shiba. Both of these places are in the midst of great phos-
phate beds, which the franchise holders are not only allowed but
expected to work. Another road will be run from the iron district
of Nezfas to Bizerta, and Sfax will be connected with the Sousse
system, bringing into the system the now isolated Sfax-Gafsa line.

One can not but remark the rational and just policy which has pre-
vailed in this protectorate; everything has been worked out with an
eye to the economic development of the country. But it is only
fair to say that Tunis has enjoyed from the beginning the freedom
of action which Algiers achieved only last year. Political inter-
ference, so common in Algiers, and petty local rivalries, like those
of Oran and Constantine and Bone, are scarcely to be found in the
land of the bey.

The only one of these town struggles worth mentioning is that
between Bizerta and Tunis. Bizerta, a port of some military impor-
tance, is desirous of becoming a great commercial center as well.
Its interests therefore clash with Bone on one hand and with Tunis
on the other; but this rivalry has had an effect beneficial rather than
otherwise on the railroad development.

The European power to whom the honor of having done the great-
est work toward the introduction of the railroad into Africa is,
unquestionably, England. Before long British locomotives will cross
the continent from Cairo to the Cape. In the northeast they already
run to Khartoum, a distance of nearly 1,400 miles from Alexandria.
Egyptian trains which formerly had their terminal at Assiut (225
miles south of Cairo), now go 78 miles farther on tracks laid by the
English in 1881 to reach Keneh. From this point to Assuan, near
the first cataract of the Nile, the road is in the hands of a private cor-
poration. Still farther on is the military line into Sudan, pieced
onto the Egyptian svstem by the little fragment built in 1874-75
between the first and second cataracts.
726 THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE RAILROADS.

This military line is interesting for many reasons. It has two
branches, one through the Nubian desert and the other extending
into the province of Dongola. Although laid with extreme repidity,
the average expenditure per mile did not exceed $15,200. Of course
there were practically no great feats of engineering involved. At
one place there is a straight level stretch of 45 miles. The declivities
average less than 0.008 m. and, excepting the Atbara bridge, some
1,200 feet long, there was no particular difficulty of construction.

But the hasty manner in which the road was built entails constant
repair and necessitates a series of supplementary works, which will
increase somewhat the initial cost per mile.

The roads south of Wady Halfa already furnish very useful data
concerning railway operations in a desert country. On them it is
possible to make observation on the rapid wearing away of the rails
by the sand and the destruction of the cross-ties by neuptera. Water
trains are found necessary, since in the whole stretch of 237 miles
between Wady Halfa and Abou-Hamed water could be reached but
twice—then by boring, in one case 858 feet and in the other 975 feet.

At the point last named, although the summer heat is excessive.
there is a roundhouse for locomotives, with a shop for small repairs.

task of keeping in running order seven different types of locomotives,
garnered by the military authorities in their haste to open the road.

The weekly schedule at present includes two express trains, ad-
mirably equipped with parlor, buffet, and sleeping cars. Besides
these a mixed freight and passenger train starts daily from each end
of the line. The shipments to the south consist of military stores
and construction materials, while the northern freights are made up
of rubber, ivory, ostrich plumes, and grain. As the list indicates,
the tonnage is still of very modest dimensions, yet it is sufficient to
pay a good share of the expenses of operation.

The extension to Lake Albert of the northern section of the pro-
posed transcontinental road between Cairo and the Cape is postponed
for the present. Instead the English have decided to undertake the
construction of a road from the Nile to the Red Sea. The attempt
to join Berber and Suakin was abandoned in 1881, after an immense
amount of money had been spent on some 20 miles of road; but the
project has been revived, and to-day work is being done on both ends
of a road between Suakin and Khartoum by way of Kassala. From
Kassala it is planned to run a great southern line through Abyssinia
to Lake Rudolph, and thus connect the Egyptian system with that
of eastern Africa,
728 THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE RAILROADS.

The counterpart of the continuous semicircle of railroads from the
Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, which is still in a state of pro-
jection above the equator, exists as a fact in the southern part of the
continent, for, on October 6, 1902, at a point 600 miles from the east-
ern coast and 1,365 miles from the Cape, was made the junction be-
tween the lines running westward from Beira by way of Salisbury
and those running northward from Cape Town by Bulawayo.

During the last twelve years the South African railroad system
has grown with astonishing rapidity. When the chartered company
was founded, in 1889, the road from the Cape went only to Kimber-
ley and that from Beira was not even thought of. To-day, after a
period of feverish activity to which not even the Anglo-Boer war
could put an end, the number of miles of railroad in the vicinity of
the Cape is nothing short of marvelous.¢

In Rhodesia especially, under the resistless energy of Cecil Rhodes,
the railway has taken a great leap forward. The Cape Colony
road comes to an end at Vryburg; beyond that point the construc-
tion of the southern section of the Cairo transcontinental line is
assumed by the Chartered Company, which steadily continues its
progress toward the north. Bulawayo was passed some time since ;
Wankies, with its coal fields, has just been reached. To the 200
iniles just completed will soon be added the 72 which le between
Wankies and the Zambesi. A bridge, nearly 700 feet long, across
the river just below the celebrated Victoria Falls, will enable the
locomotive to reach the copper mines recently discovered in Rhodesia.
Ascending to an altitude of 5,000 feet, the road will proceed toward
Lake Cheroma. On the salubrious plateau in which the lake is
situated the company proposes to establish one of its principal
transcontinental stations, which, it is expected, will prove very
important from a sanitary viewpoint. The proposed line then
descends to the level of Lake Tanganyika and terminates at Abercorn,
on the southern extremity of the lake.

It will then remain only to cross the Belgian and German territory
which les between Tanganyika and Victoria Nyanza, the final sec-

tion of 520 miles between Ujiji and Mengo. All this is but vague
planning so far, because there has been as yet no understanding with
KXongo or with Germany.

Moreover, all the railroad activity in Rhodesia just now is in the
immediate vicinity of Boulouwayo. This capital, which aspires to
become the Chicago of South Africa, is so rapidly becoming a center
for coal roads that it looks as 1f its ideal will be attained in the near
future. The coal fields at Wankies, near by, are of a wonderful
richness. They cover an area of more than 600 square miles, with
deposits 6 feet thick of coal almost equal to the better English
grades. The opening of these fields will greatly aid the economic
development of the country and largely increase the use of railroads.
It is noteworthy that, in spite of the Boer war, the commerce of
Rhodesia has increased 400 per cent during the past six years.

The three principal African systems present the greatest diversity
in their equipment, but in no respect is the variety of types more
marked than in the matter of the gauge of the track. The width
varies from 0.60 meter at Swakopmund, in the German southwest,
to 1.435 meters in the Algeria-Tunis system, but everything indicates
that the narrow-gauge, from 1 to 1.067 meters, which is now most
common, will be used almost exclusively in the future.

After having overcome every obstacle and put into successful
operation the railroad of lower Kongo, the Free State is now: plan-
ning to open means of communication with its eastern frontiers.
It proposes to establish, within six or seven years, a line running
across the continent from west to east, which will combine transpor-
tation by rail and steamboat.

When this line is completed, passengers and freight will be car-
ried over the following route: By sea to Matadi, in the navigable
estuary of the Kongo; by rail from Matadi to Leopoldville (Stan-
ley pool). a distance of 242 miles; by steamer to Stanley Falls. At
Stanley Falls the road branches; the northeast arm comprises a rail-
road to Lake Albert, boat across the lake, railroad between Lake
Albert and Victoria Nyanza, boat across Nyanza, and the Uganda
Railroad to Mombassa, on the Indian Ocean. The east and south-
east branch will consist of a railroad, to avoid the rapids, and a
steamer for a 3800-mile voyage up the river to Kassongo, where
the road again branches. One of its arms will reach Albertville, on
the west shore of Lake Tanganyika, whence the German lines on the
opposite side are expected to put it into communication with the
coast. The other section will continue by boat up the Kongo as
far as it is navigable, avoiding the rapids by railroad.. The posi-
tion thus obtained on the southern borders of the Free State will
ultimately. it is expected, be put into communication with the North
Rhodesia system.
730 THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE RAILROADS.

East of Stanleyville this Belgian transcontinental route, with its
alternate locomotives and steamboats, will spread out, fanlike, in
three directions. The line in the center, with the assistance of the
German roads, will go direct to the east coast; the two extreme
routes will open out on the English system, so as to establish unin-
terrupted traffic with Cairo on the north and the Cape on the south. -
The accomplishment of this project, as a whole, would bring about
a complete transformation of the equatorial regions, which would
in turn affect every part of the African continent.

Before the opening of the lower Kongo line the transportation of
a ton of merchandise from Stanley Pool to Matadi took twenty-one
days and cost $200. Now the journey is made in twenty-one hours,
with a proportionate reduction in cost. The effect of this on the
production of rubber is significant. In 1887 there were exported
30 tons, with an aggregate value of $21,855; in 1900 the amount
shipped exceeded 5,300 tons, and was valued at $7,974,801.

Adequate transportation from Stanley Pool to Stanley Falls is
assured by the presence of a fleet of over 100 steamers. The largest
of them belong to the Kongo Free State, which owns nearly 30; the
Belgians operate a score, and the French 40 or more.

The work on the line between Stanley Falls and Mahagi is now
completed. Although the way had to be cut through the virgin for-
est the task was not an extraordinarily hard one. Except for the
swamps there were no real obstacles. The passage over the Blue
Mountains between the valleys of the Kongo and the Nile entailed a
great expense, but failed to raise any difficult problems in engineer-
ing. Mahagi, the northernmost of the Belgian stations on the Nile,
looks down upon Lake Albert. Having an excellent climate, good
air, and atmospheric conditions favorable to Europeans, it is eml-
nently suitable for the terminal depot of a great railroad.

Meanwhile the English have got the start on the Belgians in the
region of the great equatorial lakes. Karly in 1902 the locomotive
made its appearance on the border of Victoria-Nyanza; the last rails
of the Uganda Railroad had just been laid. This enterprise may
well be considered the greatest triumph of African railroad construc-
tion. It offers a unique example of a single stretch of nearly 600
miles of rail run through an absolutely uncivilized country, where
obstacles of every kind accumulated in a manner truly extraordi-
nary.

For the first 150 miles the engineers had to contend with the terrible
climate of the low coast regions, as deadly to man as was the tsetse
fly to the beasts of burden. The mortality among the latter, imported

from the Cape, Cyprus, and India was frightful. | Among the laborers
the average rate of death by fever was over 3 per cent. Native work-
men were entirely lacking, and it was necessary to bring more than
20,000 Indian coolies, whose transportation and keep entailed a heavy
expense. Since the resources of the country were practically noth-
ing, such an army of laborers could not be maintained without having
all the provisions shipped from Bombay and Colombo. It was
especially difficult to secure fresh water during the building of the
first 250 miles. Thus handicapped the work of construction ad-
vanced very slowly.

On reaching the mountains the situation changed completely. The
insanitary conditions disappeared; an abundant supply of fresh
water was found. But as the troubles about workmen were dimin-
ished, in their place arose great technical problems. The complete
ignorance of the engineers as to the behavior of the water in that
region during the rainy season made it very difficult to plan bridges
and viaducts. Moreover the scarcity of construction materials com-
plicated continually the work of the builders. For example, it was
impossible to find any suitable brick clay.

The work was begun in 1896 and finished six years later. The line,
which extends 587 miles over a variety of levels, begins at Kilendini,
on the Island of Monbasa, and terminates at Port Florence, on Victo-
ria Nyanza. The tracks consist of 55-pound rails laid on metal ties,
except in spots where the sun is so scorching that it was necessary to
use wood ties treated with creosote.¢

The stations are built partly of masonry and partly of sheet iron,
corrugated and galvanized. In 1902 the company owned 92 loco-
motives, of which 22 were switch engines; there are 154 passenger
and 1,123 freight cars. A daily train is run, besides an express and
four freights each week. Ordinarily the rate of speed is about 15
miles an hour, the whole run taking nearly two days. During the
year 1901-2 the shipments did not exceed 11,000 tons in and 1,250
tons out; the gross receipts were only $350,000. Since the expense of
construction was over $26,000,000, the question naturally arises as to
how far the results thus far obtained have justified this expenditure.

Without dwelling on the fact that the line has not yet completed its
second year, it is necessary to call attention to the great change that
the establishment of the railroad has wrought in English East Africa.
Indian merchants have established stock farms along the line and
opened markets at the principal stations. Their stores are all well
stocked, particularly that at Nairoli, where manufactured articles of
every description and even luxuries may be obtained at a very slight
advance over regular prices.

a These wood ties are not attacked by the white ants.
732 THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE RAILROADS.

Nairoli, chosen on account of its healthfulness as the center of
operations for the road, is a bustling little city of 5,000 inhabitants
in a spot where solitude once reigned supreme.

In the Kikuyu region agriculture has made decided progress. In
the extensive gardens there are raised nearly every variety of the
vegetables and fruits of Great Britain.

At Port Florence a wooden pier extends 130 feet into the lake, so
that the steamers can land without difficulty.

The Uganda Protectorate owns two steamboats of 600 tons dis-
placement; these draw less than 5 feet of water, but can carry 12
first-class and 100 deck passengers, besides a good cargo. Stopping
at the principal points, it takes three days to make the trip from Port
Florence to Entebbe, halfway round the lake.

Taking into consideration, therefore, the whole of this new state
of affairs which has come into Uganda and the Upper Nile with the
opening of the railroads, one can but see that it will not be long
before England’s financial sacrifice will be rewarded by the rapid
economic advance of these rich provinces which have been enabled
to enjoy quick and reasonable transportation. The aftermath will
be a continued growth of shipments by rail and a corresponding
growth in the receipts of the railroad.

Having looked at all the English and Belgian projects for a trans-
continental road from east to west, there still remain to be considered
two colonies on opposite coasts—German East Africa and the Portu-
guese colonies on the Atlantic.

The projects most favored in Berlin are intended primarily to
join Tanganyika with the Indian Ocean. But the lack of enthusiasm
shown by the Reichstag for African enterprises has not encouraged
the administration to ask for the necessary funds. Only the most
modest enterprises have been undertaken, although, according to
governors von Liebert and Goetzan, the rapid development of rail-
roads is a question of life and death for the eastern colony. The
embryo system of German East Africa now consists of the first see-
tion of the Usambara railroad, the fifty miles getween Tanga and
Korogwe. Begun in March, 1902, this portion has cost thus far
5,500,000 marks; it will be extended 40 miles to Mombo. Owners
of coffee plantations in the colony expect to derive great benefits when
this line finally put in working order. Just now the efforts of the
colonists are directed toward obtaining permission from the Reich-
stag to construct immediately the 142-mile line between Dar-es-Sa-
laam and Mrogoro.

On the Atlantic coast the Portuguese have for a long time operated
the line from Loando to Ambaka, an important industrial center;
this is to be extended eventually to Malanji, but there is no thought of
crossing the continent in this enterprise.
THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE RAILROADS. 1733

An entirely different idea obtains in the minds of the promoters of
the Angola-Benguela railroad which was conceded to an English
company in 1902 by the Government at Lisbon. The proposed route
starts at the Bay of Lobito, follows the boundaries of the two prov-
inces, runs as far as Caconda and stops for the moment, after a run
of 850 miles, on the eastern boundary of the Portuguese possessions.
The work is to be completed within eight years; the company has
reserved for itself, among other privileges, the right of working the
forests of the State and that—a very valuable one—of working all
the mines found within a zone of seventy-five miles on either side of
the track.

Without waiting to see the outcome of this tremendous project,
the characteristic enterprise of the British has inaugurated a second
scheme to be developed simultaneously. Being the owner of the
great copper and lead mines at Tsumel, the South West African Com-
pany decided to build a railroad to Port Alexandria in Middle
Angola to put them in communication with the Atlantic. In making
plans for this, they suddenly hit upon the scheme of running from
the same terminal a transcontinental line eastward to the capital of
Transvaal. This road will intersect the Capetown-Bulawayo line
about Gaberon, making the junction at a point 630 miles from Port
Alexandria and 458 miles Capetown. Since these two towns are
about 1,260 miles apart on the shore line, and since Capetown is only
204 miles nearer Pretoria than is Port Alexandria, it seems but rea-
sonable to presume that in the future the commerce of Western
Europe with the old Boer republic and Rhodesia will go by way of
Port Alexandria, which will in that case become a formidable rival
to the capital of the Cape of Good Hope.

Having reviewed the three great systems and the various trans-
verse lines, it now only remains to glance at the series of independent
roads, the larger number of which are in the west coast colonies. In
this field of action, more restricted but very interesting nevertheless,
the first place belongs undoubtedly to France. Tor some years that
country has displayed real energy and impartiality in an effort to
hasten the introduction of the locomotive.

The Senegal road from Dakar to St. Louis for a long time was the
one favored enterprise. Construction on the railway directed inland
towards the Niger dragged desperately; it seemed as though every
possible obstacle was thrown in the way of its achievement. Things
are at last beginning to look brighter. Two hundred miles of the
road is now in actual operation, the embankments have reached a
point 100 miles beyond Kiba, and will go as far as Koulikoro in 1904.
Within eighteen or twenty months the entire 350 miles between
Kayes and the Niger will be put into use.

‘

734 THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE RAILROADS.

This event will exercise an incalculable influence on the agricul-
tural and commercial development of the vast regions situated in the
bend of the great river. To accentuate the value of this road, which
will be of especial benefit to the culture of cotton, the governor-gen-
eral of Western Africa is planning a line from Thies to Kayes. This
would make an unbroken stretch of rails from the ocean to the Niger.

Farther east, the railroad starting from Cotonou will eventually
reach the same stream at Carimana above the falls of Boussa. Thus
the whole group of French colonies of the West Coast will be girdled
by a semicircular artery of trade, 1,200 miles of which will consist of
navigable river.

The Dahomey line was begun in 1900; at the end of two years 60
miles of it was in actual use. A few months ago a locomotive had
been run a distance of 150 miles to the temporary terminal at Paouig-
nan. From here it is expected to go, without much difficulty, to the
Niger at Carimana, about 500 miles from the sea.

In Guinea the road from Konkary to the Niger has about 90 miles
of tracks laid; no doubt two or three years will pass before it attains
Timbo.

Ivory Coast, like the other French colonies, has cherished a railway
scheme for a long time, but has been continually put off by the flurry
over gold discoveries. A recent decision by the ministry, ordering
to be constructed the first 45 miles of the proposed line, has finally
brought satisfaction. As in Guinea and Dahomey, the road will be
built under the direction of the engineer corps of the army, which in
this instance will have complete supervision of both track and
roadbed.

Any account of French railroad operations in the Dark Continent
would be incomplete did it not mention the line, which has so aroused
the jealousy of the British, thrown out toward the high plateaus of
Abyssinia by the Somali coast. The firm and sensible position
taken in the matter by the French Government in 1902 has not yet
reaped its full reward. The climate at the base of operations on the
Red Sea is so unfavorable, and the country to be traversed so moun-
tainous, that the road will not reach Harar for nearly six years.
Since February, 1903, plans have been made for its further extension
to Addis-Abeda.

The English as yet have litle reason to felicitate themselves on the
results of their railroad building in the Guinea Gulf colonies. In
Gold Coast. the Government, after spending $47,000 a kilometer on
40 miles of track, was glad to turn the work over to a contractor, who
agreed to finish the 140-mile section between Tarkoua and Kumassi
for $21,000 a kilometer. One hundred miles of the railroad, from
Sekondi to the gold beds of Ashanti, is now completed.
THE ECONOMIC CONQUEST OF AFRICA BY THE RAILROADS. 1735

In Lagos the work was carried on a little more economically ;
there it cost only $30,006 to lay a kilometer of track. This line is
now running between the coast and Ibadan; it is to be extended
northward some 120 miles. On reaching the Niger it will be con-
tinued up the left bank of the river in the direction of Zoungerou,
the new capital of Nigeria. This bit of railroading is undertaken
at the suggestion of Sir Francis Lugard, with a view to opening up
the vast stretches of land suitable for cotton raising.

The German Agricultural Company in Kamerun is busily occupied
in covering the whole of its concessions with a web of industrial
lines. But this purely local work is insignificant when placed along-
side of that proposed by a Berlin syndicate organized in 1902, which
expects to have completed by 1905 a line runing northeast 120 miles
into the interior. The importance of this road will be realized when
it is understood that it will probably form the first section of a great
German trunk line, 340 miles long, which will have its terminus on the
shore of Lake Chad. In return for the services which this line will
render to the cocoa, tobacco, and cotton plantations it has been granted
50 hectares of land. Besides this the railroad expects as soon as its
locomotives have worked into Borneo, to draw into its hands the entire
commerce of central Soudan.

The German possessions in the southwest have not fallen behind;
they also have there 120 miles of railroad between Tsoakhaubmund
and Windhock. The whole distances is in working order, and the
road is especially valuable in carrying Government supplies. In
the olden days it used to cost $96 to haul a ton of merchandise on an
ox cart from the coast to Windhock; it now costs but $11.20 on the
railway.

Thanks to the services of this road and to the great granite jetty
recently constructed in connection with it, Tsoakhaubmund is des-
tined to become the shipping place of the copper taken from the mines
at Otavi.

From this brief discussion of railroad activity in the Dark Conti-
nent several general conclusions are apparent.

England, through her various roads and her much talked of trans-
continental from Cairo to the Cape is already assured the com-
mercial supremacy of eastern north and south Africa: in fact of a
good half of the Dark Continent. The Kongo Free State will derive
in the near future the riches, agricultural and commercial, of her vast
territories by the opening of a giant system, in which river and rail-
road will aid in forming a great transverse artery in the zone of the
equator. In western Africa the preponderant part devolves unques-
tionably upon France.

THE PRESENT ASPECTS OF THE PANAMA CANAL
By WILLIAM H. Burr.

Inasmuch as it is scarcely nine months since the present Isthmian
Canal Commission was created, and as the first month and a half of
that time was nearly wholly occupied in its first visit to the Isthmus
for the purpose of inspecting the work about to be acquired by the
United States, any view of the Panama Canal project at this early
date must be a consideration of what has been transmitted from the
New Panama Canal Company to the United States Government, -
rather than a review of plans adopted or of methods of construction
for the great work undertaken. Indeed, it must be borne in mind
that the title of the Panama Canal property was actually transferred
to the United States Government only on May 4, 1904, so that the
Commission has been in control of the canal property but seven
months at this writing.

The full report of the former Isthmian Canal Commission of its
work performed “ with a view to determining the most practicable
and feasible route for” a ship canal across the American Isthmus 1s a
complete compendium, not only of all data existing at that time re-
garding the canal property, but also a comprehensive statement of the
plans and estimates of that Commission regarding the type of canal
recommended by it. The conditions under which the canal is to be
built and the character of the ocean traffic to be accommodated have
changed so radically within the period elapsed since the old Panama
Canal Company went into bankruptcy that the work before the pres-
ent Isthmian Canal Commission must necessarily be largely inde-
pendent of anything hitherto contemplated, and its plans must be de-
veloped and completed for practically an entirely new project. This
is a necessary procedure for a number of important reasons. Among
others, during the past three years, even, material developments in
the size and motive power of steamships have been made and those
developments are in active progress at the present time. Steamships
over 700 feet long have been built, and there are already serious state-

ments from ocean transportation companies regarding the building of
ships approaching 800 feet in length. Loaded vessels have entered
or left the harbor of New York with a draft of 32 or 33 feet and pos-
sibly a little more. For these general reasons the former Commission
prescribed a bottom width of 150 feet for the canal and a depth of
water of 35 feet. Although it is not probable that the greatest ships
afloat will, immediately after its completion, seek the Panama Canal,
it is practically certain that the opening of such a canal will shift
some lines of ocean traffic and stimulate others, so that it 1s a measure
of wisdom only to follow the instructions given to the former Com-
mission and tacitly at least to the present Commission, to construct a
waterway which shall afford accommodation for the largest ships
afloat.

The Panama Canal line will be practically identical with that first
adopted by the old Panama Canal Company and subsequently ac-
cepted by the new Panama Canal Company. There will certainly be
some modifications of details of alignment, but in the main the French
location was well considered, and the canal will be built upon -it.
There is still an open question as to the advisability of what is known
as the Tiger Hill alternative, which was so strongly advocated by
the late Mr. George S. Morison, member of the former Commission.
This alternative line was originally surveyed and located by Com-
mander Lull, U. S. Navy, in 1875. It covers that portion of the
‘anal location between Gatun, about 6 miles from Colon, and Bohio,
about 17 miles from the same point. It is a shorter line than the
French location by about 14 miles. It also has the advantage of mov-
ing the canal line away from the Chagres River to the foot of the high
ground easterly of that river and throughout a portion of its length
materially higher than the low marshes along the course of the river.
It has two disadvantages: One, that the excavation of the old Panama
Canal Company between Gatun and Bohio would be abandoned.
necessitating a correspondingly increased amount of new excavation;
and the other, that the canal prism would be carried for a consider-
able distance between Tiger Hill and Bohio within an embankment
attaining a height in some places of nearly or quite 20 feet and rest-
ing on soft ground. The necessary data for the determination of this
and other features of modified alignment have been already largely
secured, enabling such questions to be satisfactorily answered in the
near future.

The total length of the Panama Canal between 6-fathom curves in
the two oceans is 49.09 miles, of which about 17 miles on the Carib-
bean side and 84 miles on the Pacific side, i. e., practically one-half
the length of the canal, is to be excavated through low, marshy
eround little above sea level. . These two portions of the line consti-
tute the Atlantic and Pacific sea levels in the plans of the new Panama
THE PRESENT ASPECTS OF THE PANAMA CANAL. 739

Canal Company as well as of the former Isthmian Canal Commission.
This is an important feature of the project, especially in considering
ultimately whether a sea-level canal or canal with locks shall be built,
for it indicates that in any event a little more than one-half of the
canal will be a sea-level waterway. Will it, then, be advisable to give
to the remainder (less than half the length) the same freedom from
restriction of locks to navigation ?

The intermediate 24 miles of canal line cover the higher portions
of the low saddle in the Cordillera at the Panama crossing. The
highest point in this saddle before any excavation was made at
Culebra was about 330° feet above mean sea level. The length of
this deepest canal cutting through Culebra Hill is scarcely 3,000 feet.
Strictly speaking, the heavy part of the summit cut, comprising
what is ordinarily known as the Emperador and Culebra cuts, is not
more than 6 miles in length, and its original surface elevation, with
the exception of the Culebra portion, averages about 175 feet above
mean sea level. The natural slope from the Culebra Cut toward the
Pacific is relatively abrupt, it being but 4 miles from the cut to Mira-
flores, at which both the former Commission and the New Panama
Canal Company located their first lock on the Pacific side of the
Isthmus. The slope from the northerly end of the summit cut at
Emperador toward the Caribbean is relatively gentle, the distance
from Emperador to Bohio, where the New Panama Canal Company
and the former Commission located the first lock on the Caribbean
side of the Isthmus, being 16 miles. No well-developed plans for
either of the terminal harbors have been made up to this time, but
such plans are now being thoroughly considered by the present
Commission.

The Old Panama Canal Company, which began its operations in
1881, planned a sea-level canal having a depth of water of 29.5 feet,
and bottom width of 72 feet. It carried on work actively until 1889,
when it suspended operations and went into bankruptcy, its exca-
vations amounting to a total of about 72,000,000 cubic yards. The
New Panama Canal Company has excavated about 8,000,000 cubic
yards since that time. The work of excavation of the old company
was distributed over parts of the entire line, although there were
considerable portions of the line on which no excavation at all was
made. Over some other portions of the location relatively small
quantities of material only were taken out. The largest parts of
this work were performed within about 12 miles of Colon, within
about 5 miles of Panama, and within a distance of about 7 miles,
including the great Culebra and Emperador cuts. The excavation
along the sea-level portions of the canal at either end was all made
in soft ground, but in the excavation in the Emperador and Culebra
cuts, as well as at Obispo, near the point where the Chagres River
740 THE PRESENT ASPECTS OF THE PANAMA CANAL.

first cuts the line of the canal as it flows toward the sea, considerable
rock was found, some of it being dense and hard. In addition to
this work of actual excavation, the French companies, especially the
New Panama Canal Company, accumulated a large amount of avail-
able information regarding the subsurface material and depth of
bed rock at many points along the line. The examinations, includ-
ing jet borings at the proposed Bohio and Gamboa dam sites and for
the proposed dam at Alajuela higher up the river, are included in
this portion of their operations. The performance of this large
amount of excavation work and the investigations disclosing infor-
mation regarding the subsurface materials have largely revealed
with certainty the character of the greater part of the work to be
done in completing a ship canal. In other words, they reduce
materially those exigencies of such a great work which consume
time and add to the cost.

Of the total excavation hitherto made and amounting to about
80,000,000 cubic yards, probably not more than one-half will be avail-
able in the construction work to be planned by the present Commis-
sion. This, however, constitutes an available asset of much value.

There is another asset, available to an uncertain extent, in the im-
mense quantity of material and plant, left largely in well-kept ware-
houses but otherwise spread along the entire line in an exposed
condition. The apparent book value of all this material, as shown
in the records of the New Panama Canal Company, is about
$29,000,000. By far the greater part of this value is now imaginary
only. A considerable part of the plant and a large amount of the
material in the warehouses can, however, be brought into condition
of much value as the work progresses. Indeed, several of the old
bucket dredges, a large number of dump cars, and various other
plant, including a most useful machine shop at Matachin, have
already been repaired and put into service by Mr. John IF. Wallace,
the chief engineer of the Commission. The present Commission has
thus come into control of a great ship-canal work, a small portion
only of which has been performed, and with the greater part of the
data required for the ultimate solution of all its problems yet to be
determined. These problems include, first of all, the answer to the
main question, whether the canal shall be a sea-level canal or of the
lock type. Whether one type or the other be adepted, they cover also
such great features of the work as the interior harbor at the Colon
or Cristobal entrance to the canal and possibly the exterior harbor
lying outside of it; the control of the Chagres River in times of flood,
involving the construction of probably a great dam at Bohio or at
Gamboa and possibly a tunnel through the Cordillera to divert the
waters of the Chagres River toward the Pacific Ocean; additional
harbor facilities at the Ancon’or Panama end of the canal; the eleva-
THE PRESENT ASPECTS OF THE PANAMA CANAL. 741

tion of the summit level if-a canal with locks should be built, and the
number, location, and lift of those locks. Manifestly, the solution of
some of those problems must depend upon the rate at which excava-
tion can be made, either in rock or in earth, and its unit cost. Further
than this, in the event of building a lock canal, it is highly probable
that a great dam will be required across the Chagres near Bohio,
whose construction would involve unprecedented methods upon a
large scale in consequence of the great depth of bed rock at that
place.

Preparation for construction was begun by the Commission last
May by organizing engineering field parties which sailed from New
York during June and the early part of July. At the same time Mr.
John F. Wallace, formerly general manager of the Illinois Central
Railroad Company, past president of the American Society of Civil
Engineers, was appointed chief engineer of the Isthmian Canal Com-
mission, and he entered upon his duties the latter part of June.
There were five of these parties, besides the engineering force organ-
ized for the purpose of designing and constructing waterworks and
sewer systems for the cities of Panama and Colon.

Taking these forces in the order of their location from Cristobal,
the American port at the Caribbean end of the canal, the first 1s lo-
vated at that point. This party is charged with the duty of making
all the requisite surveys and investigations, including jet borings,
both on land and water, needed for the development of the complete
plans for the interior harbor at the mouth of the canal, for the deep-
water channel leading to it from the harbor of Colon, and for any
advisable realignment of that portion of the canal between Cristobal
or Colon and Gatun, about 6 miles inland. The second party was
intrusted with the surveys and investigations required to determine
the feasibility of building a dam across the Chagres Valley af Gatun
and to ascertain whether it is desirable to confirm the location of the
French companies between Gatun and Bohio or to adopt the Tiger
Hill alternative between those points. The third party has under-
taken to make exhaustive investigations, including surveys, neces-
sary for the location of a dam across the Chagres near Bohio, also
to make certain other surveys connected with some minor details of
relocation in the same general vicinity. This party is making many
jet borings on a number of profiles, so as to secure complete informa-
tion regarding the deep bed rock under the river. In this manner
the most favorable location for the Bohio dam, should it be con-
structed, may be conclusively determined. The fourth party has
been assigned to the responsible duty of making extensive surveys
and other investigations from Gamboa, where the Chagres River and
canal line intersect, about 30 miles from Colon, 12 miles or more up
the Chagres Valley. This work will cover the continental divide
749 THE PRESENT ASPECTS OF THE PANAMA CANAL.

at the summit of the Cordillera, the southerly limit of the Chagres
watershed, and the divide constituting the northerly limit of the
same shed; it will include also the numerous borings to bed rock at
the Gamboa dam site and at other points. It will disclose the infor-
mation requisite for the determination of plans for effectively con-
trolling the flood flow of the Chagres River. The data already
obtained show that it 1s entirely feasible to build a dam at Gamboa
and to divert a portion or all of the waters of the Chagres to the
Pacific through a tunnel not more than 7 miles long, or toward the
Carribbean Sea through a tunnel piercing the other divide and about
4 miles long, the former probably being preferable. The surveys of
the French companies failed to disclose any location for a tunnel less
than 10 miles long through the Cordillera toward the Pacific.

The New Panama Canal Company had a labor force of about 700
men engaged in excavation at the great Culebra Cut when the canal
property was turned over to the present Commission in May last.
The organization of this force and plant has been maintained and
greatly increased in efficiency. The fifth field party was assigned to
such engineering work in connection with this great excavation as
will be required for its ultimate execution and in making the final
location in the vicinity of Culebra. This force has also been instru-
mental in installing a system of field accounts, so that a complete
daily record may be kept of progress and cost of all classes of work.

All of these parties have conducted the operations assigned to them
continuously and energetically. They have secured data of great
value in the ultimate solution of the main problems of the project.
They are still at work in their several fields, but these preliminary
operations are drawing to a close, thus enabling the Commission
promptly to study and formulate the final plans on which the work
of construction on a large scale depends.

The United States Government is required under the treaty made
with the Republic of Panama not only to construct complete water
works and sewer systems for the cities of Panama and Colon, but
also to formulate and execute certain sanitary measures for those
cities. In accordance with the terms of the agreement recently
reached by Secretary Taft with the Panama Government at the city
of Panama, complete control of this sanitary work has been vested in
the United States Government represented by the Isthmian Canal
Commission.

The source of public water supply selected for the city of Panama
is a reservoir in the upper Rio Grande Valley close to the great Cule-
bra Cut and about 10 miles from the city. The dam for this reservoir
was constructed in the days of the old Panama Company by M.
Philippe Buneau-Varilla, chief engineer, and subsequently the first
ininister plenipotentiary from the Republic of Panama to the United
THE PRESENT ASPECTS OF THE PANAMA CANAL. 743

States. This is an interesting example of a curved concrete dam
built in a few days’ time and: containing little masonry, yet it has
proved admirably adapted to its purpose. This dam will be raised
and strengthened so as largely to increase the capacity of the reser-
voir. <A 16-inch cast-iron pipe will convey the water to a distributing
reservoir at Ancon, in the Canal Zone, at a suitable elevation on the
northeastern slope of Ancon Hill immediately adjacent to the city
of Panama. The supply has been based upon an estimated daily con-
sumption of 60 gallons per head of population. The distribution
system is complete in every particular and adapted to any extension
required by the future growth of the city. The construction of this
waterworks system has progressed so far as to render it practically
certain that the city will receive the first public water in its history in
February next.

The planning and construction of the sewer system has also been
pushed forward as rapidly as possible and it will be completed ready
for use soon after the introduction of water. The sewer system is d1-
vided into three districts, each having an outfall into the sea water of
Panama Bay, at a sufficient distance from the shore to provide abun-
dant dilution. The system is designed to receive the sewage of the
city and a rainfall of about 1 inch per hour, any excess over the
latter being carried off on the surface. When it is remembered that
the city of Panama has never before had a sewer system it can readily
be appreciated what a sanitary relief both the sewer system and the
water supply will be ts the city.

The water-supply and sewer systems for the city of Colon have
also received the careful attention of the Commission. A suitable
source of water, however, has not been so easy to find as at Panama,
and the sewer system can not be constructed until a considerable
amount of filling with excavated material from the canal has been
completed. Both works, however, will be undertaken and finished
in the near future. As the population of Colon is under 6,000, while
that of Panama is nearly 20,000, the conditions bearing upon the
sanitation of Colon are the more easily controlled pending comple-
tion of its waterworks and sewers.

It may be interesting to observe, although not in line with the
actual construction of the canal, that the Commission among its other
duties is charged with that of the civil government of the Canal Zone,
a territory 10 miles wide, running across the Isthmus with the axis
of the canal as its center line, but excluding the cities of Panama and
Colon as delimited under the treaty. Maj. Gen. George W. Davis,
U.S. Army, retired, member of the Isthmian Canal Commission, is
the governor of the Zone, and under his jurisdiction have been organ-
ized by the Commission most effective hospital and sanitary forces,
with Col. W. C. Gorgas, U. S. Army, as chief sanitary officer. The

great hospital on the slope of Ancon Hill, with its 700 beds, has been
put in excellent working condition, while the sanitary forces of the
Commission have already rendered highly effective services toward
bringing the entire Zone into sanitary condition, especially in the
extermination of mosquitoes. Boards of health of high character
and excellent quarantine organizations have been established both at
Panama and Colon. Although four sporadic cases of yellow fever
have occurred in Panama within the last six months, the infection
has not spread from any case, in consequence of the vigilance of the
medical and sanitary forces. The general health of the Isthmus has
been good and there seems to be a certain promise of excellent sani-
tary conditions hereafter, such as to enable the forces of the Commis-
sion to perform their work in safety from epidemics and with the
highest degree of efficiency obtainable in the Tropics.
SANITATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE.

By Col. W. C. Goreas, U. S. Army,
Chief Sanitary Officer.

Irom a sanitary point of view the location of the Panama Canal is
very important. It is within the limits of the Republic of Panama.
in the Tropics, and about 9° north of the Equator. For engineering
reasons the lowest point in the mountain range, running north and
south through the Western Hemisphere, has been selected, the range
at this point being about 300 feet high. The Isthmus, in its general
direction here, runs east and west; the canal, therefore, in a general
direction is north and south. The local coast line at the point where
the town of Panama is situated bellies somewhat toward the south,
so that when you look to the east you see nothing but the Pacific
Ocean as far as the eye can reach. It struck me with surprise and
took me some time to get used to the phenomena of every morning
seeing the sun rise out of the Pacific and set behind the mountain on
which I live. My preconceived ideas were just the opposite—that is,
that the sun should rise out of the Atlantic and set in the Pacific.
As a matter of fact, the town of Panama is some 20 miles east of a
line drawn north and south from the town of Colon.

The town of Panama was established early in the sixteenth cen-
tury, and was probably selected because the ridge of the hemisphere

was lowest at this point and because the Chagres River gave river
transportation at this point about two-thirds the distance across the
Isthmus. The Isthmus is narrower, considerably, at several other
points than at Panama; but the ridge at these points is very much
higher. The town rapidly grew in importance, and in the first hun-
dred years after its settlement was probably the most important town
in Spanish America. Here Pizarro’s expedition was fitted out, and
here all the enormous gold and silver treasure from the South Amerti-
can conquests came across the continent. In 1671 the English bucca-
neer, TTenry Morgan, captured and sacked the city after he had out-
maneuvered and defeated a larger and superior Spanish regular
force on the broad savannas adjacent to the town. After this catas-
trophe the present location of Panama was selected—a high penin-

. 745

746 SANITATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE.

sula running south into the Pacific and easy of defense. It was so
strongly fortified that no attempts thereafter were made to carry it
by storm. It stands about 6 miles west of the site of the old town,
of which abundant ruins are still visible.

In former days a good paved highway ran straight north through
the mountains toward the convenient port of Puerto Bello, but when
the railroad was constructed the northern terminus was located at
the present town of Colon. The line of the canal, so far as it is at
present fixed, runs about 50 miles north and south, between the port
of Colon on the north and Panama on the south. It follows in gen-
eral, beginning from the northern end, the valley of the Chagres
River and one of its branches—the Obispo—up to the top of the
divide at Culebra, some 35 miles, and then down the valley of the Rio
Grande to Panama, some 15 miles. Contrary to the general impres-
sion that I had formed before coming down, the country is rolling
and well drained, being essentially a mountainous district. The
Chagres, of course, has marsh and lowlands in its valley, but no more
than half the smaller rivers and larger creeks of the mountainous dis-
tricts of Alabama or New York. The country in general is very
attractive, high and variegated as it is, with rolling hills and
tropical verdure as far as the eye can reach. Insects and reptiles
are scarce, and our friend, the mosquito, could not be called abun-
dant. I believe any dweller of Staten Island or New Jersey, after a
week’s residence, would leave with the impression that there were
none of the latter.

For purposes of canal building the United States has purchased
a tract of land extending along the whole length of the line of the
‘vanal 10 miles in width, of which the canal is in the center. The
history of this Zone with regard to health has been exceedingly
lugubrious, just as it has occurred everywhere else in the Tropics or
wherever a large, unacclimated population has been brought in,
either for military or industrial purposes. The railroad was built in
the early fifties, and its cost was greatly increased and the work itself
several times stopped on account of the heavy mortality among the
unacclimated laborers brought here. Later, between the years 1880
and 1889, the same thing occurred on a much larger scale in the
French attempt to dig a canal under De Lesseps. The diseases
‘ausing the most mortality at these times were yellow fever and
malaria.

At the present time on the Zone there are 40,000 inhabitants,
Panama containing 20,000, Colon 10,000, and the towns along the
canal between Panama and Colon 10,000. The prevailing disease is ’
malaria. Leprosy also exists. In Panama we have at present some
yellow fever and a great deal of beriberi, and, of course, all other
SANITATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE. TAT

tropical diseases to a limited extent. Eighteen months from the
present time, I am informed by the chief engineer, we will probably
have on the Isthmus a force of some 15,000 men. Estimating from
our present ratio, I am inclined to think that not more than 2,000 of
these will be Caucasians and the other 13,000 negroes. Now, the
sanitary problem will be to protect these 15,000 men from malaria
and from yellow fever. I will take up first yellow fever. I assume
it as accepted that it is conveyed from man to man only by the
female Stegomyia, who has previously bitten some human being
suffering from yellow fever. Therefore, given a place in which there
are no infected Stegomyia, yellow fever can not originate until a
human being suffering from yellow fever has been introduced and
infected the local Stegomyia, or unless the female Stegomyia, infected
at some distant point where yellow fever prevails, has been intro-
duced. Practically the first is almost the only method of infecting a
locality—namely, the introduction of a human being suffering from
yellow fever. The city of Panama has been in the condition for a
great many years of at all times having within her borders some
infected Stegomyta at all seasons of the year, and the nonimmune
foreigner coming within her limits is liable to contract the disease.
Yellow fever is at present endemic nowhere on the Zone except in
the city of Panama. The object of the sanitarian is, therefore, to
get rid of the infected Stegomyta at present existing in the city, and
this can be done in this way: Establish a system whereby the health
authorities will pretty certainly be informed of every case of yellow
fever occurring; then take the house in which this case occurs and
fumigate it, so as to destroy all the mosquitoes within its borders.
Do the same with all the contiguous houses.

This, it has been found by experience, kills all the infected mos-
quitoes at that particular focus. The same thing is done at every
other focus as yellow fever occurs. Gradually, in this way, all the
foci in the community are destroyed; and when you have destroyed
your last focus yellow fever is at an end. Or, if you want to be
more expeditious and the town is not too large, you can systematic-
ally fumigate every house in the town, and thus pretty certainly
destroy all infected mosquitoes and do away with yellow fever much
more rapidly. But no system of reporting is ever absolutely certain
and the sanatarian should see that other very important adjuncts
to the fumigation work are carried on at the same time. The
Stegomyia is a house mosquito and cleanly in her habits, seeks prin-
cipally clean rain-water barrels and water containers, and lives very
close to her birthplace, not traveling far. Therefore, as an addi-
tional sanitary safeguard, every receptacle for water should be so
screened and, covered that mosquitoes can not have access. All
748 SANITATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE.

yards should be thoroughly cleaned, so that there will be no old
bottles or cans left around. The water supply should be piped in,
so that the people will not desire to have water in containers. Sewers
should be put in, so that there will be no excuse for people to throw
slop water in the yards. AIl standing puddles should be drained and
kept dry. Streets should be paved and kept well swept, and the
garbage carefully collected, with a view to decreasing to the mini-
mum all trash capable of retaining fresh water in any way. When
Panama has been in this state for a month or two we will be in the
same condition that Habana is, as the result of just such operations
as I have described above. When Panama has thus been freed from
yellow fever we will not have any more until a man sick from yellow
fever 1s introduced from some infected point without. This we will
prevent by a proper system of quarantine, just as Habana has done
for the past three years.

Thus I can see the entire possibility of protecting our laborers on
the canal during the whole time of its construction from one of the
two greatest causes of former mortality. e

But I think that probably a more important problem for the
health of our laborers, and certainly a much more difficult one to
deal with, is that of malaria along the line of the canal. The
10,000 natives living along the canal are distributed in about 20 small
villages. These people are very generally infected with malaria. A
recent microscopical examination of the blood of people, taken at
random at various points along the line, in several hundred cases
showed parasites in the blood of 50 per cent of these people on the
first examination. This means pretty certainly that about 80 per
cent of the natives at the present time have the malarial parasite in
their blood. Four times out of five, when a female Anopheles bites
one of the natives she becomes infected, and when she, in turn, bites
one of our nearby laborers he becomes infected. It is thus evident
that our force will rapidly be used up, just as was the French, unless
our sanitary measures prevent it.

Now, we can approach this problem from two sides; either on the
side of doing away with the infected human being so that he can
not infect the mosquito, or doing away with the mosquito so that she
can not transmit the parasite from the diseased to the well. If we
could kill these 10,000 natives and keep our laborers away for four
or five months until all previously infected mosquitoes had died, the
problem would be settled; but our superiors would very properly
not sanction this very drastic measure, even if proposed by us. But 1f
we have some substance which could be introduced into the circula-
tion of the infected man, and kill the parasite and at the same time
not be injurious to man, we would accomplish the same object just
SANITATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE. 749

as effectively as if we killed the man, and the measure would not
meet with such general opposition as the former proposition would.
In quinine we have discovered this poison. This vegetable sub-
stance is harmless to man and fatal to the malarial parasite. The
greater number of practical tropical sanitarians, the Germans and the
Italians conspicuously, advocate and have been successful on these
lines—have gotten as large a proportion of the population as possible
to take small quantities of quinine with as much regularity as they
could; and thus have been successful, without adopting any other
measures, in doing away with malaria in the several localities. Or,
we can attack it from the side of the mosquito; do just what we
intend doing in Panama with regard to the Stegomyia: Cover all
water containers, clear up the yards, fix the roads so there will be no
puddles, have a regular system in all the towns of collecting gar-
bage and waste so there will be no cans around; and ditching every-
where there are small breeding places in the neighborhood of dwell-
ings, and oil where ditching is not practicable. This latter method
of killing the mosquito is the method most in favor by English and
American tropical sanitarians. This alone has been successful in
eradicating malaria in many localities.

Along the route of the Panama Canal the malaria problem, I think,
is more difficult to deal with and more serious than any place where
it has previously been tried. We therefore expect to adopt both
methods, and I am convinced that in this way we will be able to
protect our laborers from the serious mortality that has undone our
predecessors in this important work.

The other diseases to which we are subject, I think, will not give
us serious trouble, but will be controlled by the ordinary measures
usually adopted by a health department.

THE PROJECTED NEW BARGE CANAL OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK.

By Col. THoMAs W. Symons, U. S. Army.

In the years following the Revolutionary war the subject of naviga-
ble canals was a very absorbing one to our forefathers. In this new
and rapidly developing country in those pre-railroad days the impor-
tance of canals in the transportation world can hardly be appreciated
at the present time. Canals were projected all over the country,
and many were built. The attention and labors of the ablest men of
the period were devoted to canal schemes, their financing, locating,
and building.

A good many of the canals that were built have succumbed to new
conditions and been discontinued, being unable to stand the competi-
tion of railroads. Some, however, have stood the test of time and
have remained important factors in the commercial world to the
present day. Without question the most important of these early
artificial waterways was the Erie Canal through the State of New
York, connecting the Hudson River with Lake Erie. This canal,
although originally built of small size, played a very important part
in the settlement of the great West, or what was then the great West,
by furnishing a route in connection with the Great Lakes by which
the products of the new western country could reach the markets
along the seaboard, and by which in turn it could get its supphes of
clothing, tools, groceries, etc., at an economical rate for transporta-
tion. It is certain that the settlement and development of the New
York and New England hinterland were enormously expedited by
the Erie Canal.

Locally in New York State the effect of this canal was shown by
the increasing commercial importance of New York City and the
establishment and development along the line of the canal of the
most important chain of cities in the country—Albany, Troy, Cohoes,
Schenectady, Little Falls, Utica, Rome, Syracuse, Rochester, Lock-
port, and Buffalo.

752 PROJECTED NEW BARGE CANAL OF STATE OF NEW YORK.

Some of the early New York canals have been abandoned. Those
which are left and kept in a navigable condition are: the Erie Canal,
connecting the upper chain of Great Lakes above Niagara Falls with
the Hudson River, and thence with the seaboard; the Oswego Canal,
which connects Lake Ontario with the Erie Canal, and the Cham-
plain Canal, which connects Lake Champlain with the navigable
water of the Hudson. The Erie Canal, which is the principal mem-
ber of this canal trinity, 1s 350 miles long, and ut present has 72
locks. It was originally built with a depth of 4 feet, with locks 90
by 15 feet, being of a size to accommodate boats of but 80 tons capac-
ity, and was completed in 1825. Tolls on the canal were high at first,
but were gradually reduced, and for many years have been abolished
altogether.

It is a noteworthy fact that before they were finally abolished the
tolls had more than paid for the canals of the State and their enlarge-
ment.

The small 80-ton canal was soon found inadequate, and it was
enlarged to its present capacity—that is, for boats carrying 240 tons
of freight. This work of enlargement was started in 1835, but was
not completed until 1862.

When the canal was built, and when it was enlarged, the only
known or successfully developed method of canal-boat propulsion
was by animal towing, and a tow path was provided all along the
ranals, The necessity for this tow path was one of the principal
factors which caused the canal to be kept out of water courses and
built in the upper portions of the valleys. The development of steam
‘anal-boat propulsion has changed the problem, and the great canal
that New York is to build will now be located, wherever possible,
in streams and lakes, and it will have no towpath. This will reduce
the cost of maintenance enormously, for the cost of keeping the
towpath in order is the heaviest item of expense of the present canal.

The New York canals were no sooner enlarged to their present size
than agitation for their further improvement commenced. This
culminated, about ten years ago, in the adoption of a project for deep-
ening the canals so that they would accommodate boats of 8 feet draft
instead of 6 feet, and for lengthening the locks so that they would
take two boats of the same length and width as at present, coupled
tandem, at one lockage. The State made an appropriation of $9,000,-
000 to carry this project into effect. It was soon found, however, that
the amount named was grossly inadequate, and that to complete the
project would cost two to three times the sum which had been voted.
The work was also badly managed, and the people of the State were
indignant at the deception which had been practiced on them regard-
ing the estimates and the scandals attending the work, and the project
was abandoned. Then came another period of agitation, investiga-
PROJECTED NEW BARGE CANAL OF STATE OF NEW YORK. 1753

tion, and discussion. All sorts of things were proposed. Many
prominent people wanted a ship canal connecting the Great Lakes
with the sea, and several routes were surveyed, and estimates of cost
of various sized canals made. Many wanted the $9,000,000 project
completed, either as originally proposed or with modifications. Some
‘wanted to turn the State canals over to the General Government, and
depend on it for maintenance and improvement. Some wanted to
abandon the canals altogether, and some to utilize the canal right of
way for State railroads.

In 1897 the writer of this paper, in a report to the General Govern-
ment, proposed, as the best solution of the problem, that the canals
should be enlarged to enable them to be used by barges carrying 1,000
to 1,500 tons. Governor (now President) Roosevelt appointed a
board of prominent New York business men soon after this to advise
the State what to do with its canals, and this board, after more than
a year of investigation, and the careful consideration of everything
that could be proposed, reported in favor of enlarging the Erie Canal
to a capacity for barges of 1,000 tons, and a lesser improvement for
the Oswego and Champlain canals. The legislature caused surveys,
plans, and estimates for the work to be made. All the canal people
of the State finally came in under the banner of the 1,000-ton barge
canal, and through their united efforts the legislature at last passed
a bill for the enlargement of the Erie, Oswego, and Champlain
canals, to enable them to be used by 1,000-ton barges, with all the
locks of sufficient size to take two boats, coupled tandem, at one
lockage.

The estimated cost of the work proposed was $101,000,000. At the
fall election of 1902 this proposition was submitted to the people of
the State, who approved it by a majority of about 250,000 votes.

New York is thus committed to and has entered upon this tre-
mendous work of canal improvement—by far the greatest work ever
undertaken by any State.

This projected work is in the very front rank of canal propositions.
It is overshadowed in the public mind by the Panama Canal, on
account of the international character and the interesting complica-
tions that have attended the inauguration of that work by the United
States. In commercial importance the Erie is in many ways the
equal of the Panama Canal. On the Panama it is hoped to some
time reach a tonnage of 10,000,000; on the Erie all works, structures,
water supply, ete., are predicated on a tonnage of 10,000,000, and pro-
visions are made for accommodating, at shght additional expense, a
tonnage greatly in excess of this. On the upper Great Lakes there
is a water-borne commerce of very nearly 90,000,000 tons per year.
The Erie Canal will furnish the cheapest route for connecting this

754 PROJECTED NEW BARGE CANAL OF STATE OF NEW YORK.

vast lake commerce with the seaboard, and its wide-reaching influ-
ence can hardly be conceived or appreciated except by those who
have given years of study to the problem.

In magnitude the work that New York has undertaken exceeds the
work at Panama. More earth and rock must be excavated, more
masonry used, and more dams built. The cost per unit is not nearly .
so high as at Panama, because the work will be done in the Temperate
Zone, where labor, tools, and materials are abundant and reasonably
cheap.

In the complexity of the engineering questions involved the Erie
is hardly second to the Panama Canal, for while the canalization of
the Mohawk River is a very different problem from the control and
utilization of the Chagres River they are both engineering projects
of the very first magnitude.

The building of the Panama Canal under conditions akin to the
proposed enlargement of the Erie Barge Canal would be a simpler,
cheaper, and easier work than that which New Yerk has undertaken.

The barge canals that New York is to build will follow the same
general route, fulfill the same functions, and minister to the same
wants as the present navigable canals connecting Lakes Erie, Ontario,
and Champlain with the navigable waters of the Hudson below Troy.

In three important respects they will differ from the existing
canals: First, as to size and capacity; second, as to location, and
third, as to the character of navigation provided for.

The locks of the new canals, which govern the dimensions of the
boats that can be used, are 28 feet wide, 310 feet long, and 11 feet
deep. The canal prism has a depth of 12 feet and a general minimum
width on the bottom of 75 feet in canal sections and 200 feet in rivers,
pools, and lakes. Boats can be built which will pass through the
‘anal carrying 1,000 tons of freight, but it will probably be found
advantageous to sacrifice some of the carrying capacity to secure bet-
ter models and greater clearance. The lift of the locks will be much
greater than at present, and the number of locks will be greatly
reduced. On the present Erie Canal there are 72 locks; on the new
Krie Barge Canal there will be but 38 locks.

The new locks will take two canal boats, each of 150 feet length,
coupled tandem, at one lockage, and this makes the lock capacity
2,000 tons, or about eight times that of the present canal. As freight
boats nearly always travel in pairs coupled tandem, the advantage of
the double-length locks in doing away with the necessity of uncoup-
ling and recoupling at every lock is very great, saving much time and
lessening dangers.

A very decided change is made in the location of the canals. The
Erie Canal is about 350 miles long, and the new canal follows the old
canal for only about 100 miles; the other 250 miles is almost entirely
PROJECTED NEW BARGE CANAL OF STATE OF NEW YORK. (DD

by anew route. Large portions of the Champlain and Oswego canals
also follow new locatrons.

The existing canals may be called * hillside” canals, as they go
through the open country and along the upper portions of the valleys
above the rivers, from which they religiously keep away to the great-
est extent possible. The new and greater canal is put in the valley
bottoms and in the water courses and lakes wherever practicable.

The principal advantages of the valley-bottom location in the case
of the greater canal are cheapness of construction, greater freedom
and ease of movement by boats in the wider waters of the water
courses and lakes, greater rapidity and less cost of transportation,
greater immunity from accidents that disable the canal, and less cost
of maintenance. With the small canal as originally built and as sub-
sequently enlarged to its present size it would not have been econom-
ical, with the knowledge and means then possessed, to have built the
dams and locks required to canalize the Mohawk and other rivers and
to excavate the large channels required for flood discharge. With
the large barge canals now proposed this canalization 1s not only
desirable, but is cheaper than it would be to utilize the existing lines
of the canals.

The existing canal is a “ tow-path ~ canal, built with the distinct
idea that all business on it should be done by animal towing. In the
new and larger canal no tow path is provided, and it 1s expected that
navigation through it will be by means of steamboats properly
adapted to it and towing other motorless cargo boats, in accordance
with the custom which has been developed and is now in vogue on the
Erie Canal to a certain extent. It is this change in the method of
navigation which permits the valley bottom, lake, and water-course
location to be adopted.

Long years before the construction of the Erie Canal the early
pioneers had found a water highway extending nearly acreoss the
State of New York, and it was largely used by those who settled
the western portion of the State. It was not perfect, involving, as
it did, many portages about falls and rapids and from one river to
another, and the stemming of swift river currents, with bars and
shoals, but it fulfilled a most useful function.

The Erie Canal when built did not follow this pioneer route for
reasons stated: but it is a remarkable circumstance that now, after
nearly a century of disuse, this old pioneer route is to be again
adopted and the new and larger barge canal is to follow it without
material deviation. This old pioneer route followed up the Mohawk
River, with portages about the falls and bad rapids, to the vicinity of
Rome; thence a portage was made across to the waters of Wood
Creek: thence it followed down the waters of this small stream to
Oneida Lake,” On across the lake it went and down the Oneida River
756 PROJECTED NEW BARGE CANAL OF STATE OF NEW YORK.

to the junction of the Oneida, Oswego, and Seneca rivers, at Three |
River Point—a famous locality in the olden days. Here two routes
were open to the enterprising traveler. If he were going to the set-
tled western part of the State he would follow up the Seneca River
and thence into the various branches and into the beautiful “ finger ”
lakes tributary to the Seneca. At that time and by that route the
cost of transportation between Albany and Seneca Lake was from $75
to $100 per ton, and it took four weeks to make the round trip. If he
were going farther west, or into Canada, or had much freight to
transport, he would ofttimes go on down the Oswego River to Lake
Ontario and thence by lake to his destination.

The projected route of the Erie Barge Canal follows up the Hud-
son River to Waterford; thence, by means of the requisite locks, it
reaches the Mohawk River above Cohoes Falls. rom Cohoes Falls
to just west of Rome the river is canalized—that is, dams are built,
forming great pools, and these pools are connected by channels not
less than 200 feet in width and 12 feet in depth. Above Rome
there is a summit level leading over to Wood Creek, and, as in the
olden days, the canal route follows down this stream and through
Oneida Lake and Oneida River to Three River Point, thence up the
Seneca River properly canalized to the vicinity of Clyde. From
Clyde westward there are no water courses of importance running
in the right direction, and the new canal will follow generally the
route of the existing canal to the Niagara River at Tonawanda;
thence the Niagara River will be used up to Lake Erie and Buffalo.
Between Clyde and Tonawanda there is one important modification
of the route, and this is at Rochester. The present canal goes through
the city in a very awkward manner, crossing the Genesee River in a
masonry aqueduct, and the route is impracticable for the large canal.
Here a new route is adopted, passing to the south of the city and
crossing the Genesee River in a pool formed by damming the river.

The Oswego Barge Canal leaves the Erie Canal at Three River
Point and keeps on down in canalized Oswego River to Lake

Ontario.

The new Champlain Canal keeps in the Hudson River from Water-
ford to Fort Edward, instead of following along on the bank of the
river as at present. In doing this advantage 1s taken of the commer-
cial power dams which already exist in the river, and which, in con-
nection with locks to pass them and the deepening of the river be-
tween the pools, will fully canalize the river. From Fort Edward
to Whitehall, at the foot of Lake Champlain, the new canal follows
the location of the existing one.

The most important question connected with any canal proposi-
tion is that of water supply, and the Erie Canal is no exception.
The western end of the canal will be fed from Lake Erie, as at
‘ PROJECTED NEW BARGE CANAL OF STATE OF NEW YORK. 757

present, the existing canal from Lake Erie to Tonawanda being
retained as a water feeder only. This, with natural local supplies
from streams along the line, will give all the water required until
the Seneca River is reached, which has an abundance of water. The
only locality where the water-supply problem attains great impor-
tance is at the summit level, between the Mohawk River and Oneida
Lake. This is provided for, in the larger canal, by utilizing the
existing sources of supply and developing additional ones by water
storage in West Canada Creek, the Mohawk River, and Oriskany
Creek.

If in the future more water is needed, due to increased use of the
canal, or for any other reason, this can be supplied by additional
storage in the Adirondacks at a comparatively small expense.

It is believed that these new and enlarged canals will be of benefit
to New York in enabling her to retain and increase her commercial
supremacy, largely through thei controlling influence on freight
rates and the prevention of differential discrimination against the
port of New York, which is now and has for years been the rule.

They will also benefit the entire region of the Great Lakes, and this
benefit will extend far into the interior of the great Northwest and
influence transportation rates throughout the country.

Upon the Great Lakes many millions of tons of freight are trans-
far lower than are pos-

ported every year at exceedingly low rates
sible by any other than water transportation. The canals that New
York has undertaken to build will practically extend this cheap. sys-
tem of water transportation to the seaport of New York and other
ports in the vicinity, and bind the East and West closer together.

RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES.2

By Mito R. MALTBIE.

The problem of urban transportation is largely one of rapid com-
munication between business and residential districts, and has grown
iereasingly difficult as population has become more and more con-
centrated. Street-car companies have tried every conceivable kind of
motive power, but they have not been able to keep up with the rapid
growth. Steam railroads, which have proved so successful as inter-
urban means of communication, have been excluded from most centers
because of the noise, smoke, and ugliness of the trains. Horse traction
is not sufficiently rapid, and the cable for the same reason has given
way to electricity.

However satisfactory surface lines may be for short-distance traffic,
their inadequacy to deal with suburban traffic became apparent almost
half a century ago in the larger urban centers. The steam roads
undertook to solve this question by lowering fares and by greatly
increasing the number of trains. London went a step further and
built underground roads connecting most of the depots in the metrop-
ols. Other cities, such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Liverpool,
and Berlin, have constructed elevated roads, but these are unsightly,
and within the last few years they also have proved or are proving
inadequate to deal with the vast throngs who daily leave their homes
to seek work in other portions of the cities in which they live. And
now, as the last resort, electric subways are proposed, and systems
have been or are being built in Paris, Budapest, Glasgow, London,
Boston, and New York,’ while other cities are considering the ques-
tion.

760 RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES.
RAPID TRANSIT IN LONDON.

Owing to the enormous cost of constructing underground roads, a
large daily traffic is essential to successful operation. This condition
appeared first in London. When railroads were invented and their
utility generally recognized, London was already a city of consider-
able size (population in 1851, 2,563,274). Its ancient streets were
considered too sacred to be polluted by a noisy monster, and the im-
portance of rapid communication between the central portion of the
city and suburban areas was not yet recognized. Thus the first steam
vailroads were halted at the threshold of the inner city and made to
build their terminal stations some distance from the center of com-
mercial activity. With the growth of the city and the giving over of
certain portions almost exclusively to business, some means of com-

Fia. 1.—The Central London tunnel.

munication between the various depots became necessary. Steam
surface roads were out of the question; electricity and cable traction
had not been invented, and horse cars were too slow. Underground
steam roads seemed the only alternative.

For years the construction of these lines went on, until at pres-
ent there are 300 miles and upward of 270 stations within a 6-mile
radius of Charing Cross. These railways probably carry over 300,-
000,000 passengers annually, and, including the omnibus, tramway,
cab. and steamer passengers, the total approaches very nearly to
1,000,000,000 persons annually.

The unpleasant features of travel in the ‘“ underground ”—the
dingy entrances, the dark tunnels, the dirty, crowded, and dimly
lighted cars, the sulphurous fumes from the engines, the dirt-laden
air—were appreciated from the start and grew worse as the traffic
increased. The lines were mostly near the surface, and openings
were provided at short intervals to permit the smoke, steam, and
RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES. 761

gas to escape, but they very inadequately performed that function.
The managers, with the characteristic English slowness to adopt
new methods and the desire to make large profits, reminding one
of the New York Manhattan Elevated Railroad Company, refused
to adopt electric traction, and until 1890 there was no method of
rapid transportation in London other than the steam roads.

In that year the City and South London Electric Railway was
opened, about 34 miles in extent, extending from near the monument,
in King William street, only a few blocks from the commercial cen-
ter of the metropolis, to the suburban district of Stockwell, upon
the south side of the Thames. The success of this road and the
desire for access to the heart of the city led the Southwestern Rail-
way—one of the most important Englsh roads—to construct a
short electric line between its Waterloo station and the Mansion
House, opposite the Bank of England. This line is very short, only
14 miles in length, but it does assist in solving the problem of urban
transportation in that it brings the suburban districts reached by
the Southwestern into closer communication with the business por-
tion of the city.

The Central London Railroad, the latest, largest, and best equipped
of all London subways, most nearly resembles, from the point of
location, the New York subway. It runs from the Bank of Eng-
land, under Cheapside, Newgate, Holborn Viaduct, and Oxford
street, past St. Paul’s Cathedral, Hyde Park, and Kensington Gar-
dens to a station in the suburban district of Shepherd’s Bush, a total
distance of 64 miles. There is a large traffic toward the Bank of
England in the morning and to the West End in the evening, and
the only means of transportation until lately was by omnibus or
carriage or a roundabout route via the underground. No tram-
way has been permitted to occupy this main artery, and the new
underground road will greatly add to the transportation facilities
of London,

Various other electric underground lines have been proposed, and
within the near future the Metropolitan and the Metropolitan Dis-
trict railways, now operated by steam, will adopt electricity as a
motive power. Bids and plans have already been called for.

CONDITIONS IN BUDAPEST.

After London, Budapest was the first city to build a subway.
Here it was the outcome of various plans for joing the central and
business portion of the city with the park, a favorite rendezvous some
24 miles distant. Nothing definite was proposed until the spacious
and handsome Andrassystrasse was laid out, which offered a direct
and attractive route for a street railway. Application was made for
permission to-build a horse-car line, but the plan met with strong
762 RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CGITIES.

opposition chiefly upon esthetic grounds. Several years later, after
a short experimental electric line had proved a success, the scheme
was again resurrected, electricity being the motive power. This
proposal met a fate similar to its predecessors and led to the con-
struction ot the subway. In 1894 the concession was granted, and two
years later the line was opened to the public. No other project is at
present being considered; the transportation problem is not so serious
as elsewhere, and the tramway system is very efficient, giving satis-
factory service.
THE GLASGOW SUBWAY.

The Glasgow subway was started several years before that in
Budapest, but being much larger in scope and more difficult to con-
struct, owing to the great amount of tunneling necessary, it was not
opened until the latter part of 1896. Even then it did not remain
open, for the traffic was so much heavier than anticipated that it was
necessary to close the line for a few weeks and improve the facilities
for handling crowds.

The first definite project for an underground road culminated in
1887, when a bill was introduced into Parliament to authorize such
an undertaking. The local authorities opposed it, because they
feared that tunnels under the Clyde would render any further deep-
ening of the river impossible and thus seriously interfere with the
commercial development of the city. However, in 1890, a bill was
passed; these objections did not seem of sufficient importance to
counterbalance the need for rapid transit. Short sections of the
steam roads, similar to those in London, had been operated for some
time below the surface, but they reached only a few suburban dis-
tricts. The new subway connects the business portions of the city
with the residential areas to the west and northwest. Its eastern
extremity is in the heart of the city, from whence the line makes a
broad swing to the west, some 7 miles in circumference.

As yet there seems to be no competition between the subway and
the municipal street railways. The latter do not reach many of the
suburbs served by the subway, and the long-distance traflic does not
use the surface lines because they are slower. Even with the pro-
posed extensions, there will be abundant traffic for each system.

BOSTON’S SUBWAYS.

The Boston subway was opened in 1898. It is entirely unlike
every other line, not being a separate and distinct system, but merely
affording to the surface lines a means of reaching the business dis-
tricts without using the surface of the streets. Prior to its con-
struction the street car lines from the many suburban districts
around Boston all met on Huntington avenue, Tremont and Boylston
streets, or at Scollay square. Between Scollay square and the junc-
RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES. 763

tion of Tremont and Boylston streets the congestion was so great
that traffic was almost- wholly impeded during the busiest hours of
the day. Various solutions of the problem were proposed from time
to time. An elevated road was rejected by a popular vote, and the
proposed widening of the streets involved so great an expense as to
be impracticable. The only comprehensive scheme seemed to be a
subway in the congested district, and in 1894 an act was passed author-
izing its construction. The results have been most satisfactory. The
streets are not nearly so crowded as before, and there is a great saving
to the passengers of the time necessary to reach the central portion of
the city from almost any suburb. The total length of the subway is 13
miles, and contains over 5 miles of track. Several additional lines
are under consideration.

THE COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME FOR PARIS.

The problem of rapid transit was first agitated in Paris almost

half a century ago, and as early as 1870 the municipal authorities
. S oJ

began seriously to study various solutions. In imitation of other

cities an elevated road was proposed during the eighties, but the
esthetic Parisian would have none of it. The beautiful boulevards,
streets, and public places, laid out by Baron Haussman at great
764 RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES.

expense, must be preserved at every cost. And true to French
custom no plan would be approved until a comprehensive scheme
for the whole city was formulated. This had been accomplished
by 1896, an electric subway having been decided upon. The street
traflic had become so congested that no more surface lines or omnibus
routes could be added.

The extent of the Paris metropolitan subway is indicated by the
above map. When it is entirely completed the system will be nearly
404 miles in length, will cost the city $86,000,000, and the operating
company about $10,000,000 more for equipment.* At present, only
one section and parts of two others have been completely constructed
and put in operation, namely, the line running from the Vincennes
gate in the east, past the Hotel de Ville, the Louvre, and the Tuil-
leries, down the Champs Elysees to the Place de ?Etoile, from which
three Jines operate—one to the ‘Trocadero, one to Porte Dauphine.
and one to Porte Maillot. The total length is some 8 miles, and the
cost about $7,000,000 for construction alone.

PUBLIC CONTRO! IN GREAT BRITAIN.

The relation of the municipality to the subways varies greatly from
city to city. In no instance have the city authorities undertaken
operation, but in Paris and Boston, as in New York, the public owns
the subway, having constructed it at public expense.

The extent of public control is least in Great Britain, there being
a marked difference between street railways—surface lines—and
underground roads. The former are subject to strict control, and
the municipality may take over a line twenty-one years from the
time when the franchise is granted, or may construct or purchase
the tracks and rent them toa private company. But no underground
road is municipally owned or operated, and no public authority has
the right under the act granting the franchise to purchase a line. Of
course the local authorities may regulate to a moderate degree, but

part of the journey on the Central London Railway. Of course Par-
liament knows no higher law than its own will, and may impose any
restrictions or may order compulsory purchase at any price, but all
such proceedings are without the realm of probability.

This difference between underground and tramway lnes rather
surprises one at first, for British cities have gone as far in the «lirec-
tion of municipal socialism as those of almost any other country. The
explanation is a very important fact, viz, that municipalization in
Great Britain is not so much an economic movement as the expression
of the desire that the local governments keep control of the streets.
The underground roads, in so far as they cross or pass under the
streets and public places, are using public property, to which the

public authorities have as clear a title as that of a private individual
to the ground under his house. The law knows no limit either above
or below the surface. Yet no demand has been made upon the under-
ground lines for payment or for the reservation of the right to take
over the line. It is to be borne in mind, however, that the under-
ground roads, especially those constructed since the movement for
municipalization became strong, are some distance below the surface,”
that their construction and operation necessitates very little disturb-
ance of the street surface, and that instead of increasing the street
traflic they relieve it. Further, they do not promise to be exceedingly
remunerative, and without public aid either through subsidies or free
grants to use the ground below the surface of the streets many of

property, at least 80 feet below the surface of the streets. Only the Metro-
politan and the Metropolitan District Company are near the surface and have
open subways. These are the steam roads, which got their powers years ago.

them would not have been built. Both London and Glasgow have
recognized these facts, and have not opposed the companies when
they have appealed to Parliament for power to use the ground below

the streets.
FRANCHISE IN BUDAPEST.

The nearest approach to British conditions is to be found in Buda-
pest. There the city has invested nothing; the subway has been
built, equipped, and operated by a private company. But the city
has reserved the privilege of taking over the line in 1940, when the
concessions for the surface lines expire, provided announcement is
made of its intention two years previous. Otherwise the franchise
runs ninety years from 1896, or until 1986. The maximum fare is
fixed at 10 kreutzers (5 cents) during the first fifteen years, after
which the city authorities may require a reduction. The city will
receive from the gross revenues an amount to be calculated on the fol-

lowing scale:

During the first twenty-five years the city can not grant any other
concession for the establishment of a system of transportation of any
kind between the center of the city and the park. And for the first
fifteen years the company is exempt from taxation. The city, of
course, possesses in addition the usual police powers, and the conces-
sion contains many provisions specifying how the subway was to be
built and how it is to be operated.

TERMS OF THE PARIS CONCESSION.

The position of the Paris subway is the result of many compro-
mises between the municipal council and the central government
whose approval was necessary for the execution of the project. The
central authorities insisted that the subway be connected with the
railroads in order that trains from the country might be run right
through to the center of the city and a suburban traffic thus de-
veloped. The municipality feared that the railroad companies
would get control of the subway and that a large portion of the popu-
lation would be induced to leave the city and live in the suburbs,
thereby decreasing the city’s revenue from octroi. A compromise
was finally effected, and in the early part of 1898 the act was passed,
which fixed the gauge of the road, over which there had been so much
dispute, at the standard width. But the city, in order to prevent
the railroads from ever sending their cars over the subway, has built
~T

the tunnels so narrow that only those cars can be used that are
especially constructed for the subway.

Another point upon which the municipal council and the central
government did not agree was as to who should operate the lines.
The council wished not only to own but to operate the road. The
central authorities objected, but finally compromised upon municipal
ownership and private operation. ‘This plan offers many advantages.
According to a general law passed in 1842, a private company gets a
franchise for seventy-five vears if it builds a railroad; but if a public
authority constructs a line it may shorten the period to thirty-five
years. Further, under private ownership, a company would find
considerable difficulty in raising sufficient capital to build and operate
the whole system. Paris could borrow the money easily, and not only
vasily, but at a lower rate of interest than a private company. This
saving would be no small factor and will enable the road to lower
fares ultimately.

The contract between the municipality and the operating com-
pany is most interesting. The franchise runs for thirty-five years,
but at any time within seven years from date of construction the city
may acquire the lines. The company agrees to maintain the highest
degree of efficiency, to give to its employees an annual vacation of
ten days with full salary, to give them full pay during military
instruction and sickness, to insure them against accident, and to pay
the city 2 cents for every first-class ticket and 1 cent for every second-
class ticket sold, with the added provision that when the annual
passenger traffic exceeds 140,000,000 persons, this sum shall be
increased, reaching at the highest mark 2.1 cents for each first-class
and 1.1 cents for each second-class ticket. As the concession fixes
the rate for a first-class ticket at 5 cents and for a second-class ticket
at 3 cents, and for school children with teacher at a uniform rate of
1 cent, about one-third of the entire receipts will go to the munici-
pality and two-thirds to the company. As the cost will be about
$35,000,000 for the lines thus far authorized, an annual revenue of
$1,100,000 will be necessary to pay the interest, sinking-fund charges,
and incidental expenses; operating expenses are paid by the com-
pany leasing the subway. Thus, if the entire system should carry
only 125,000,000 passengers annually, the city would more than pay
all expenses. As this is considered a very low estimate and as it
seems almost certain that the traffic will far exceed this number, the
city will probably find the subway a paying investment. The roads
in London, Berlin, and New York carry nearly 5,000,000 passengers
per mile per year; the Paris subway ought easily to reach the nec-
essary 3,000,000 per mile per year.

The entire system of subways is not to be corstructed at once, but 1s
to be divided into six sections (two more have not been approved by
768 RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES.

the central government), which are to be opened from time to time as
specified in the act, until by 1916 every line will be in operation. AJ]
are to be operated by the present leasing company and upon the same
terms as given above. The thirty-five-year period—the duration of
the franchise—is to run from the date of opening each line, and to
prevent any inconvenience which might arise from franchises for
different sections falling in at different dates, the concession pro-
vides that the company may retain possession of all until the termi-
nation of the last franchise, and shall pay 45,000 franes per kilometer
per year (314,000 per mile) for every line whose lease expires pre-
vious to that time.

CONDITIONS IN BOSTON LEASE.

Like Paris, Boston owns its subway and has rented it for twenty
years to a private company—the West End Elevated Railway Com-
pany, which has subleased it to the Boston Elevated Railway Com-
pany. The rental will never be less than 4% per cent of the cost of
the subway, and if this sum does not amount to 5 cents for each car
using the subway, it shall be made up to this sum. The income will
pay the interest on all outstanding bonds and provide a sinking
fund to extinguish them at maturity—forty years hence. All oper-
ating expenses are paid by the operating company, and at the ex-
piration of the lease the city will pay the fair value of all rails, pipes,
wires, etc., which are affixed to the subway.

COMPENSATION.

Comparing the various methods of securing compensation, it is
evident that in no instance have large profits been secured. Buda-
pest undoubtedly receives the most, considering the fact that it has
invested nothing, for even the expense of rearranging sewers, water
mains, conduits, etc., was borne by the subway company. Paris may
make the most, for if the traffic greatly exceeds 125,000,000 persons
annually, the net profit will be more than 5 per cent of the gross re-
ceipts, as the rate is about 33 per cent of the gross receipts. How-
ever, if the traffic should fall considerably below this figure, the
municipality will need to make up the deficit from other sources.
There seems to be little risk in this direction, and Paris has followed
its usual course of exacting large payments from municipal monopo-
lies rather than of requiring lower prices and increasingly better serv-
ice. London and Glasgow are at the other extreme, and New York
and Boston are not far distant, for the payments are not large, barely
exceeding for the present the interest on bonds issued for the construc-
tion of the subways and sinking fund charges to wipe out the debt.

Considerable variety exists also as to the basis for compensation.
Budapest uses gross receipts—an easily ascertainable basis and freed

from much adverse: criticism by the requirement that the rate ‘in-
crease as the years pass, or, in other words, as the road becomes more
remunerative. Paris has adopted an even simpler basis, receiving a
certain fixed sum for each ticket sold. An attempt has also been
made to vary the amount with the traffic, but not quite so success-
fully as in Budapest. In Boston and New York the cost of con-
struction is used as a basis, and the payment to the city is a fixed
sum, no matter what the profit or the loss to the private company or
the size of the traffic.
MOTIVE POWERS.

An examination of the roads themselves reveals a great difference
between those recently constructed and the underground lines in Lon-
don built many years ago. Steam as a motive power has given way
to electricity. Every London line constructed since 1890—the date
when the City and South London road was opened—has adopted the
third-rail electric system, as have also Paris and New York. The
Budapest and Boston subways use the overhead trolley. Glasgow
clings to cable traction, which is largely accounted for by the con-
servatism of the Scotch and the fact that in 1890, when the work was
begun on the subway, electricity had not yet clearly demonstrated its
efficiency. Cable traction was much cheaper, and upon the steep
grades the car gomg down will help to pull up the car going in the
opposite direction. The act of Parliament imposes no conditions
except that steam can not be used. The Glasgow subway is unique,
in that it is the only underground cable railway for passengers in the
world. Thus far it has worked very well.

TRAVEL A PLEASURE.

All the modern subways, even that of Glasgow, have adopted elec-
tric lighting, ind the cars and tunnels are in marked contrast to
those of the steam lines in London, which are dimly lghted, dirty,
and forbidding. Glazed tiles have generally been used, especially at
the stations, and in every way the comfort and pleasure of the pas-
sengers have been administered to. The entrances in Boston and
Budapest particularly are very artistic, and instead of being repel-
lant, because of their dirt and ugliness, even add to the beauty of the
streets and public places in which they are located. The London
electric lines, being situated many feet below the level of the streets,
have provided spacious elevators, which counteract the disadvantages
of deep-level travel. Thé Paris, Budapest, and Boston subways do
not need them, being located near the surface of the streets. The
Glasgow company has one, in Kelvinbridge, where the road is 115
feet below the crest of the hill, and New York will have a few where
the road is far below the surface.

sm 1904——49
770 RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES.

In the construction of the subways, plans much the same have been
followed everywhere. Where the road level is near the street level,
an open ditch was made, steel framework inserted, and the street pave-
ment replaced. Where this was impracticable, tunnels were driven;
and in a few instances short viaducts were erected. The Budapest sub-
way is everywhere just below the street level, and consists of two par-
allel lines at the same level, separated only by steel pillars, station
platforms, or thin walls. The Paris subway likewise consists of two
parallel lines and always at the same level, except where one section
crosses another and a dip is made to avoid crossing at grade. Some
of the distance the lines run side by side in a single tunnel; in other
portions each line has a separate tunnel, uniting only at stations.
The Glasgow road consists of two distinct tunnels throughout, except
at stations, as is true of nearly all the London electric lines except the
Waterloo and City road, which has only one line almost all the way.
The Boston subway has from two to four lines, usually at the same

Fic. 4.—Budapest stations.

level. except where it is necessary to raise or lower one to avoid grade
crossings. The New York line is the only one that has tracks for the
special purpose of running express trains; and with the Central Lon-
don road is unique in raising its stations above the level of the road.
Each train on its departure thus is accelerated by the force of
vravity, and as it approaches is checked by the same force. This will
greatly increase the rate of speed by reducing the time required for
stopping and starting.

Most of the modern subways are adopting the American style of
car, with an entrance at each end, in place of the old-style compart-
ment coach. Even the London roads are making the change, and the
Glasgow line introduced them at the start. The Paris car is a
hybrid, having two doors on each side, one set being used for entrance
and the other for exit. The train idea seems also to be spreading,
as being more economical and better adapted to handling large
crowds,
RAPID-TRANSIT SUBWAYS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES. Cul

There is one marked difference between foreign and American
lines. Most of the former have first and second-class compartments
or cars; the latter charge the same fare for every one. The Glasgow
subway maintains only one service and the tendency elsewhere is in
this direction. Ssome London roads have already made the change.

The uniform fare, regardless of distance, is also more common
with us than abroad. In Paris and Budapest it is in vogue, but the
lines are so short as to render a graded system unnecessary. The
Glasgow company intended to adopt it, but as the cars run continu-
ously around the circle, one would be able to ride indefinitely for one
fare. To prevent this, a zone system was adopted. A penny ticket
(2 cents) allows one to go as far as the fourth station from where
he enters the car, or about 1$ miles

one-fourth the circumference

of the road. A 2-penny ticket (4 cents) entitles one to travel any
distance, but not more than once around the circle. <A ticket is
given each passenger, which he gives up upon leaving the station at
his destination. Any one who has ridden farther than his ticket
indicates is thus found out and required to pay.

That the subways of London, Paris, Budapest, Glasgow, and Bos-
ton were needed and are performing a useful social service is shown
by the large number of passengers carried. Their influence can
only partially be estimated, but undoubtedly the effect upon social
conditions, especially housing and overcrowding, is considerable,
not to mention the saving of time in going to and from work. Doubt-
less rapid transit will not solve either the housing problem or trans-
form our cities into Utopias, but it will alleviate social conditions
and prevent what otherwise would be unbearable evils,

Sir GEORGE GABRIEL STOKES.
GEORGE GABRIEL STOKES.¢

By LrRNest W. Brown.

George Gabriel Stokes was born in Ireland on August 18, 1819.
This father, the Rev. Gabriel Stokes, was rector of the church in the
little village of Skreen, Sligo County, his mother being a daughter
of the rector of Kilrea. He was sent for his early education to
Walls’s school in Dublin, and afterwards to the college in Bristol,
whence, in 1837, he proceeded to Cambridge, entering at Pembroke
College. His hfe was henceforth fully identified with the interests
of his college. He was elected to a fellowship just after taking his
degree in 1841, and retained it until his marriage in 1857 to a
daughter of the Rey. T. R. Robinson, D. D., director of Armagh Ob-
servatory. Under the statutes of the university at that time in force,
this event compelled him to vacate his fellowship, but he was reelected
in 1869 under the new statutes and only resigned in 1902, when he
was 83 years old, to become master of the college. His tenure of the
latter post was short; he died on February 1, 1903.

Practically the whole of Stokes’s scientific fe was connected with
the interests of two bodies—his university and the Royal Society.
He graduated as senior wrangler in 1841, the first of the great trium-

virate which attaimed the coveted honor in three successive years—
Stokes, Cayley, and Adams. There were giants in those days. Sylves-
ter and George Green had taken their degrees in 1837,and Lord Kelvin
followed in 1545, and chief among those of note in other lines was
Charles Kingsley, who took honors in mathematics and classics in
1842. This period was in reality not far removed from the time when
British mathematics had been entirely isolated. Until the beginning
of the century Newton’s methods and fluxional notation were almost
exclusively employed, and it was only some ten years before Stokes
matriculated that the influence of Woodhouse, aided later by Peacock,
J. F. W. Herschel, Babbage, Whewell, Airy, and others, was success-
ful in completely establishing continental methods for examination
purposes and in forcing the recognition of the mathematical work

which had made such advances outside the country. Thus the men of
the period, in the middle of which came Stokes, had the advantage of
being trained by those who were thoroughly grounded in the old
methods, but who had spent time and energy in working up and intro-
ducing the new. Neither was the intellectual activity of the pioneers
of the new movement confined to research in mathematics. Text-
books had been written setting forth the continental methods, and
translations of foreign works had been made. <A classical tripos had
been established in 1824, but all candidates who went in for it were
required to have taken honors previously in mathematics—a rule
abolished in 1850.

The mathematical power of Stokes began to show itself immedi-
ately. His first paper was published the vear after he took his de-
gree and the decade which followed was certainly the most fruitful of
his life in regard to the equality and quantity of the work which has
come directly from his pen. The Royal Society Catalogue contains
the titles of over 50 papers printed within this period, and many of
these are not only of far-reaching importance but mark the begin-
nings of his researches into almost every department of mathematical
physics—hydrodynamics, light, elastic solids, the mathematical ex-
pression of wave motion by Fourier’s series, sound and conduction of
heat. Modest as he was concerning his own achievements, he thought
nearly all of these papers sufficiently good to be included in his col-
iected works, the first three volumes of which cover this period alone.
To mention a few of the most important, we have the researches On
the Steady Motion of Incompressible Fluids and On the Theories of
the Internal Friction of Fluids in Motion, and of the Equilibrium
and Motion of Elastic Solids, with a Supplement, which together
constitute the complete foundation of the hydrokinetics of the present
day. In the paper On the Effect of the Internal Friction of Fluids
on the Motion of Pendulums, he considers and works out the effect
of viscosity on various kinds of motion. Deep-sea waves and the soli-
tary waves are very fully treated in the memoir On the Theory of
Oscillatory Waves. But the theory of ight was the subject in which
he seems to have been most willing to work. The two papers, On the
Dynamical Theory of Diffraction and On the Change of Refrangi-
bility of Light, in the latter of which fluorescence is described and
explaied, would have alone sufficed to make his reputation.

' Two further papers, On the Critical Values of the Sums of Periodic

Series and On the Numerical Calculation of a Class of Definite Inte-
grals and Infinite Series, must be mentioned, not only because of their
great intrinsic value, but also because they show that the author was
right abreast of the developments in pure mathematics at that time
and that he was able to advance them and use them as an instrument
of research for the investigation of physical problems.
GEORGE GABRIEL STOKES. 775

This last fact is perhaps worth insisting on at the present time,
when the separation between pure mathematics and physics has be-
come far wider than is advantageous for either. The physicist works
mainly in his laboratory, the mathematician at his desk, neither
intrenching on the domain of the other. Even the magnificent work
of Poincaré, introducing the rigorous and fruitful methods of pure
mathematics for the treatment of physical problems, is only a partial
step in the right direction. With Stokes this divorce never occurred ;
experiment went hand in hand with theory. As early as 1840 he had
fitted up a small laboratory in his rooms, of simple character it is true,
but none the less sufficient to test, sometimes searchingly, the results
of his theories. And it was the same all through his life. He was
never content to leave a theory unconfirmed by experiment, and if a
new observation were made it must be compared with theory. ‘These
qualities are especially noticeable in some of his earlier papers. In
that on internal friction, he explains the suspension of clouds and the
subsidence of ripples and waves after a storm: in those on oscillatory
wave motion, the well-known experiments of Scott Russell are fully
considered ; his paper on diffraction is divided into two parts, consist-
ing of his theory and of the experiments which he made to test it, and
soon. Later in life he would, in a short note or a few remarks, give
the main outline of an explanation of some new phenomenon; fur-
ther research by others usually proved him to be correct.

This active period quickly brought recognition to him. In 1849 he
succeeded to the Lucasian chair of mathematics in Cambridge, a post
held previously by Isaac Barrow, Newton, Woodhouse, Airy, and
Babbage, and five years later he was elected secretary to the Royal
Society. He was not content with delivering the two courses of
lectures required of the professor by the regulations. He let it be
known that he considered it part of his duty to help students in their
work, and such help from a man lke Stokes was not to be despised.
He was always ready to give assistance, whether it was asked for
work already started, or in suggesting new problems to be under-
taken, or in giving encouragement where failure seemed likely. This
trait was even more conspicuous during his thirty-one years’ tenure
of the Royal Society position. Naturally brought into contact with
all the best work which was being done throughout the country, he
largely gave himself up to helping others. This was undoubtedly
the main reason for the smaller output after this time. As against
50 papers produced up to 1852, we find only 56 from then until the
end of 1883, and many of the latter consist of addresses and short
notes on such subjects as chemistry, details of instruments, and his-
tory of science, all valuable but perhaps not epoch-making like the
earlier memoirs. His reward was the frequent acknowledgment of
his assistance which those alone who had received knew how to appre-
Co GEORGE GABRIEL STOKES.

ciate. A generous tribute is given by Lord Kelvin® of his own
indebtedness, and a further one by an anonymous writer,” who tells
that though he was previously quite unknown, some work of his
attracted the attention of Stokes and a correspondence was started in
the course of which on one particular day he received as many as
three letters and a telegram! It is unnecessary to say a word on the
quality of the assistance given. It was the same throughout; knowl-
edge and time were always at the disposal of small and great.

It has been said that much of Stoke’s work was given to others,
and indeed some of it was never published in scientific journals at all.
An instance of this occurs with reference to the transformation of a
line integral into a surface integral which he put as a question in a
Smith’s prize examination paper in 1854. Again, he had thought
out the physical basis of the solar spectrum some seven years before
Kirchhoff, and had been in the habit of lecturing on it. Stokes
deprecated any attempt to obtain for himself the credit of this dis-
covery, saying that he had failed to take an essential step in the proe-
ess. It is possible that the papers he left behind will tell even more
of his own work than we know now, and they will doubtless add
much to the scientific history of the second half of the last century.

Amongst other honors, Stokes received the Rumford medal in
1852, the Copley medal in 1893, was Burnett lecturer 1883-1885,
Gifford lecturer 1890-1892, and was created a baronet in 1889 when
Lord Salisbury was prime minister.

In 1855 Stokes received the highest scientific honor which England
land has to bestow—the presidency of the Royal Society; this he held
until 1890. From 1887-1891 he represented the University. in Parlia-
ment. Being still Lucasian professor, he thus attained the unique
distinction of holding the three positions simultaneously. Only once
before had one man, Isaac Newton, occupied them all, and in his case
the tenures were at different periods of his life. In 1899 Cambridge
University fittingly celebrated the jubilee of his election as professor,
inviting representatives from all parts of the world and publishing a
memorial volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical
Societvy—a body to which many of his papers had been communi-
rated. Although at this time about to enter his eighty-first year, he
seemed able to endure fatigue without showing signs of his advanced
age. On the chef day set apart by the university he attended morn-

ing and afternoon congregations of the senate, a lunch, and a late
banquet, and the following day was early in London to attend a com-
mittee, only closing his labors on various matters late that night.

A word must be said concerning Stokes’s relation to religious ques-
tions, partly because they evidently entered much into his thoughts

and formed an essential part of his character, and partly because dur-
ing the last twenty years of his life there were published addresses and
papers on the question by him. On several occasions he spoke before
the Church Congress, the Victoria Institute, and other bodies on the
relation between science and faith. What value is to be set on these,
this is not the place to discuss; it 1s sufficient to mention that he took
a prominent part i the efforts made in England in educating the
public to higher views of the relations of science to theology, and in
rescuing the study of the former from the doubtful position which it
had, even among some of the more advanced students of religious
questions. His own personality and the methods of treatment which
he adopted were always on the side of promoting good feeling and
tending toward the prevention of acrimonious discussion amongst
those whose opinions differed most widely. He avoided, as a rule,
dogmatic statements and treated the questions in his usual scientific
manner, allowing his own opinions to be inferred rather than ex-
pressly stated.

The published portraits of Stokes, representing him with a some-
what severe type of countenance, fail to bring out a characteristic
expression. Ordinarily silent in society, he would freely talk on any
subject that interested him. While telling of some remarkable fact
or observation, the broad high forehead would pucker into a thousand
wrinkles and a smile would hght up his face with a brillianey which
seemed to show a concentrated picture of the whole man. Those who
had the privilege of listening to his highly finished and carefully
worded lectures on the wave theory of light delivered without a note,
or of watching the simple experiments and diagrams with which he
illustrated them, will remember how eagerly they looked for the first
symptoms of this change. The lectures, too, were characteristic.
Toward the end of the course, evidently wishing to give more than
was possible in the limited time, he would continue further and
further over the allotted hour until the last day when, on one ocea-
sion, amid the gradual disappearance of the class to fulfill other
engagements, he kept those who remained interested for nearly three
hours.

There was but little apparent failure of Stokes’s physical and
intellectual powers until within a few days of his death at the age of
83. He died as he had lived, in harness, and a great figure passed
away from the scene at the close of a well rounded and successful
career. His work, mainly on wave motion and the transformations
which, in its different forms, it undergoes under various cireum-
stances, has already taken a permanent place in the history of science.
And he has left behind with those who knew him a memorial of him-
self which will not be easily effaced.

KARL ALFRED VON ZITTEL.
Translated by CHARLES SCHUCHERT. 4

During an excursion in southern Tyrol in the summer of 1898,
Privy Counsellor Karl Alfred von Zittel, professor of geology and
paleontology at the University of Munich, Germany, first began to
suffer from heart trouble. On the evening of the 5th of January,
1904, he died, being then in his sixty-fourth year. In Zittel, the
Bavarian Academy of Sciences has lost its president, the University
of Munich one of its greatest teachers, and paleontology its master.
lor thirty-five years he conducted the periodical Paleontographica,
and was about to complete the fiftieth volume of this great paleonto-
logical serial, and to celebrate the event with words of rejoicing and
warranted pride, when his death changed contemplated joy into
deepest mourning.

Karl Alfred von Zittel was born on the 25th of September, 1839,
in the parsonage at Bahlingen, the seat of the rulers of Baden. He
was the youngest son of Pastor, later Dean, Karl Zittel, who was
prominent in the political life of Baden and leader of Protestant
liberalism.

Young Zittel showed an early love for natural history, and when
his father removed to Heidelberg, he, as a student in the gymnasium,
spent his spare hours in the well-known: mineral shop owned by
Lommel. Here he arranged and identified fossil snails and shells,
and thus laid the foundation of his surprising and accurate knowl-
edge of forms—a knowledge which, combined with a brilliant mem-
ory, later distinguished him as master in paleontology.

In 1857 he entered Heidelberg University as a student of the natu-
ral sciences, especially of paleontology. At that time it was neither
comfortable nor profitable to study paleontology at Heidelberg,
because of the almost insurmountable difficulties in securing the three
students necessary to induce Lleinrich Georg Bronn, author of
Lethea Geognostica and of Index Paleontologicus, and joint pub-

lisher with C. Leonhard of Neues Jahrbuch fiir Mineralogie, to give
a course in that science. But once during Zittel’s term of study were
the three students secured.

Doctor Zittel continued his studies during the year 1860 at Paris.
Here he met the venerable Elie de Beaumont. who, with Dufrénoy,
worked for eighteen years on the first geological map of France. Of
him Zittel said, * Phe geological fame of Khe de Beaumont rests on
his admirable field work and his writings concerning the age and
origin of mountain systems.” Around Beaumont and Edmond
Hébert, the honored teacher at the Sorbonne, and de Verneuil, there
gathered -many of the geologists of France s Deslongchamps,
Albert Gaudry, Nunier-Chalmas, and others. All these became the
friends of the young German, and remained so. As Zittel especially
cherished this attachment, they rewarded his loyalty with their
loyalty. As proof of their high estimation of him he was elected
in 1898 vice-president of the Geological Society of France, a dis-
tinction rarely bestowed on a foreigner.

In 1861 he studied at Vienna, then especially noted for geology and
paleontology. There he met Wilhelm von Haidinger, the founder of
natural history in Austria, and at that time the head of his crea-
tion, the k. k. geologische Reichsanstalt. Of this remarkable man
Suess has written, “ He was not a charming speaker. However, if

a young man had the courage to seek him at his home in Ungargasse,
he would then unbend his dignity. With both hands he would hold
his guest during the entire visit, while his silvery locks of hair
streamed down over the rosy cheeks preserved into old age. With
many a ‘ja, ja, ja, he would endeavor to stimulate and attract and
attach to himself the young mind, as if he wished to pour into it
some of his own warmth and an exalted conception of the duties and
the life objects of the naturalist. At the same time he would seek to
indelibly impress upon the listener how much there is to work for in
this beautiful world, and how much can be accomplished by united
effort.” Associated with Haidinger at that time at the Natural His-
tory Institute of Vienna were Franz von Hauer, the geologist par
excellence of Austria, Dionys Stur, Johann CezjZek, Fotterle, Guido
Stache, and many others. The young, gem tal Eduard Suess had then
just begun his highly honored career as the first professor of geology
at the University of Vienna. At the Royal Mineral Cabinet, Zittel
met the distinguished Moritz Hérnes, famous for his wide knowledge
of Tertiary fossils—a knowledge young Zittel must have greatly
valued because of his own previous training in the classic Tertiary
basin of Paris. At the Technical High School there taught Ferd-
inand von Hochstetter, a student of Quenstedt’s, and there also lived
at Vienna the Huguenot, Ami Boué, a great traveler, of profound
learning but singular in person.
KARL ALFRED VON ZITTEL., 781

In 1862 Zittel was a volunteer assistant to the geological survey of
Austria, being associated with F. von Hauer and G. Stache in map-
ping the coast region of Dalmatia.

In 1868 he was offered the position of professor ordinarius at
Lemberg, but declined it to aecept a far less well-endowed position
as assistant in the Royal Mineral Cabinet of Vienna, now known as
the Royal Natural History Museum. This determination on the part
of the idealist, Zittel, caused much surprise, yet to him the great
paleontologic collections of Vienna were of far greater interest than
the salary attached to the professorship. His decision was fortunate
for paleontology; he here began his paleontologic career in his studies
of the bivalves of the Gosau formation—his first extensive work.

In 1863 he returned to his home in Baden, and accepted the pro-
fessorship of mineralogy, geognosy, and paleontology at the Poly-
technic School at Karlsruhe. Here he remained three years, during
which time he married Miss Ida Schirmer, a daughter of I. W. Schir-
mer, the landscape painter, and director of the Karlsruhe Art School.

At the age of 27 years, or in the autumn of 1866, he was called to
Munich, to the distinguished position of professor of paleontology
and conservator of the paleontological collections of Bavaria. This
position had been made vacant by the early death of Albert Oppel.
In 1880 he declined a call to G6ttingen as successor to von Seebach,
and was made professor of geology; also, after the death of Schaf-
hiiutle in 1890, he was appointed conservator of the Bavarian geolog-
ical collections.

* Munich became Zittel’s second home. Here he taught and labored
for more than thirty-seven vears. These were years replete with con-
tinuous and fruitful investigation and instruction—a long period of
labor which was only occasionally interrupted by grudgingly allowed
vacations and these were not infrequently devoted to scientific jour-
neys. Strict and loyal in the fulfillment of duty, and an example to
all as a lover of work, Zittel could be found day after day in his
sunple workroom in the grey Alte Akademie in Neuhauserstrasse.
During his last months of illness it was very hard for him to be kept
from the daily walk to his Institute and from the treasures of his col-
lections. Ceaseless work was the motto of his life—even on his last
sick bed he wrote for the completion of the second edition of his
Grundziige der Palaeontologie—till death put an end to his life and
to his labors.

“At Munich Zittel entered the field of work to which he was emi-
nently fitted. Tere he was held in highest esteem, established a
world-wide reputation, and created for himself and for Munich the
greatest renown by his brilliant works, the chief being the Handbuch
der Palaeontologie. The Munich Paleontologic Museum—Zittel’s col-

782 KARL ALFRED VON ZITTEL.

lection—he made one of the greatest and most important scientifically
of the world. At Munich he founded the most renowned chair, the
largest school of paleontology, and quickly made evident the truth
of the prediction of M. Hornes in 1866, when Zittel was called to
Munich: ‘ Through Zittel the leading position in paleontology, which
heretofore Vienna has held, will be transferred to Munich.’

“ Here Zittel was recognized without envy by the entire scientific
world as the master of paleontology, the teacher of paleontologists.”

A. 5S. Woodward has stated: * For more than thirty years he had
been acknowledged as the leading exponent of the science which is
intimately connected with the progress both of geology and biology.
For a still longer period his charming personality had combined with
his wide reputation to attract to the Palaeontological Museum at
Munich students of the natural sciences from all civilized nations.”

The master of modern paleontology passed away in Karl Alfred
von Zittel. This was clearly shown during his life, and was also
acknowledged in the numerous memorials which have been written of
the great dead by Branco, Canavari, Dacqué, Diener, Giinther, Hiegel,
Jaekel, Kitchen, Osborn, Pompeckj, Rothpletz, and Woodward.

Zittel traveled extensively in the interests of geology; he made
numerous trips to the Alps, went twice into Scandinavia, England,
and North America, and more often to France and Italy, Russia and
Algeria.

His first publications relate to minerals, mineral localities, and
petrography. He next assisted in mapping the geology of Dalmatia.
and then of Baden. In glacialogy he proved, in 1873, that during
Diluvial time the glaciers extended across the folds of the Bavarian
Alps far over the foreland of the upper Bavarian North Alps; and
that to the work of glaciers is due the present topographic- and oro-
graphic picture of the Bavarian high table-land.

In the winter of 1873-74 he was geologist on the Rohlfs expedition
across the Libyan desert to the Siuah (Siwa) oasis. Of this then
terra incognita he constructed a geologic map covering the region
traveled, and showed by means of his abundant collections of fossils
that the limestone plateau forming the base of the desert is of Eocene
and Miocene age; further, that these are superposed on youngest
Cretaceous or Upper Devonian, with a fauna indicating that this
constituted a part of the Indian Cretaceous basin. The Sahara until
then was believed to have been covered by the diluvial sea, and this
fact lent itself to a ready explanation of the causes of the Glacial
period in Kurope. Zittel, however, exploded the myth of the Sahara
sea by showing that during Diluvial time Sahara was land, and that
the sand of the desert was not formed by the action of sea waves, but
is due to weathering of the older sandstones.
KARL ALFRED VON ZITTEL. 783

In connection with his geologic work Zittel also became the histori-
ographer of geology and paleontology. All that human mind and
labor have produced since ancient times for the elucidation of the
earth’s history, all that the heroes, Werner, Leopold von Buch,
Alexander von Humboldt, Hutton, Kant, La Place, Cuvier, Al.
Brongniart, Lyell,.Quenstedt, @Orbigny, and the great number of
more recent devotees have accomplished, all this Zittel had included
in one brillant picture in his Geschichte der Geologie und Palaeonto-
logie bis Ende des 19ten Jahrhunderts. An English translation of
this work was made in 1901 by one of his students, Mrs. Maria
Ogilvie-Gordon.

Zittel’s first paleontologic paper appeared in 1861, at a time when
fossils had but one value—that for the determination of geologic age.
The teachings of Cuvier then still held full sway, 1. e., each fauna
was a new creation and each disappeared through cataclysms. It is

only since 1870 that paleontology has taken an active part in the
establishment of the theory of evolution, and in reality it is only since
that time that pure stratigraphic paleontologic studies have become
more sharply distinguished from the biologic systematic, the latter
more and more emphasizing the genealogic aspect.

From the end of the sixth decade Zittel’s work begins to take on
the character of paleozoology as contrasted with the older paleontol-
ogy. By means of a study of the ammonites of the Stramberger beds,
he is led to discuss the relationship of the forms, and is convinced
that there are no unchangeable types, but that the species are simply
isolated individual complexes derived from unbroken evolutional
series. The cataclysm theory and the teachings of types being over-
come, Zittel declares himself an evolutionist. He always remained
so, and had a great influence on paleontology.

How the history of living organisms merges into the history of
the earth is brilliantly described in Zittel’s Aus der Urzeit, published
in 1872 (second edition, 1875). Here he also discusses the hypothesis
of the origin of the earth, following the teachings of Kant and
Laplace, without, however, making dogmas of their theories.

In 1876 he began his classic studies on fossil sponges, determining
their beautiful spicular structures by etching with hydrochloric acid
and elucidating with the microscope. Until this time it was thought
that the fossil sponges had little in common with recent forms, but
Zittel showed that all can be grouped in the classification of ving
sponges are psendomorphs after siliceous forms, but that true calca-
reous sponges do exist among the fossils, a fact disputed by Haeckel.
Zittel originated the classification of fossil and recent sponges, and
actually made it possible to study fossil forms.

In the realm of vertebrate paleontology he has published several

papers, and * those on the Chelonia and pterodactyls from the litho-
graphic stone of Bavaria are especially valuable contributions to
science ” (A. S. Woodward).

Zittel’s great versatility in paleontology showed how difficult it was
becoming for a person to master this one of the biologic sciences.
Material was being accumulated in all parts of the world, and results
were being published in many languages and in almost unlimited
places. A work was needed to orient this great accumulation. In
part, this had been accomplished by Bronn in his Lethaea Geognos-
tica, and in the text-books of Geinitz, Giebel, Quenstedt, Pictet,
VOrbigny, Owen, and Nicholson. Some of these works, however,
had become antiquated. and ‘none did justice to the growing science
of paleontology from the point of view of the paleontologist. Zittel
therefore undertook to orient all the material into one work, which
should not only be an aid to all expert paleontologists, but should also
form a basis of the science. From 1876 to 1893 he labored on the
animal fossils, while the paleobotanical part was undertaken by his
friend, W. Ph. Schimper, of Strassburg, and after the latter’s death,
by A. Schenk, of Leipzig. Zittel thus gave to the scientifie world
his greatest and most distinguished work, his Handbuch der
Palaeontologie. This stupendous undertaking, which resulted in
seventeen years of continuous search and deliberation, is published in
6 volumes, + of which are Zittel’s, containing 3,357 pages and 2,976
figures. It is the Eneyclopedia of Paleontology and the Dictionary of
Extinct Genera of Plants and Animals, including their classification
and geological duration. Branco has justly said that it is the * res-
cuing deed” in paleontology. Later the handbook was translated
through the joint work of seven savants, headed by Charles Barrois.
In 1895 Zittel rewrote and condensed his great work into one vol-
ume

the Grundziige der Taleontologie (Talseozoologie), which has
since been translated into English, under the leadership of one of
Zittel’s American students, Charles R. Eastman. :

Osborn has stated in Science: “ It is probably not an exaggeration
to say that he did more for the promotion and diffusion of paleontol-
ogy than any other single man who lived during the nineteenth cen-
tury. While not gifted with genius, he possessed extraordinary
judgment, critical capacity, and untiring industry.”

While Zittel, since 1868, worked in paleontology along the lines of
evolution, he never came to be a strong adherent of the neo-
Lamarckian school. In fact, the development of the individual
(ontogeny) did not seem to him to be reliable evidence as indi-
eating the phylogeny of the stock and thus leading to a natural clas-
sification of organisms. The teachings of Cope and Hyatt did not
take a strong hold on him, and we see in the second edition of his
KARL ALFRED VON ZITTEL. 785
Grundziige, published shortly after his death, that he adopted none
of the philosophic work-of the collaborators in the English transla-
tion of the first edition. In- this connection, A. 5S. Woodward has
stated in Nature, * His last essay of general interest was an address
on Paleontology and the biogenetic law.” ‘This address * was almost
the only occasion in which Professor von Zittel ventured to express
any opinions on the philosophy of biology or the solution of funda-

regarded as suggesting important novel points of view.”

Tn 1844 the Munich paleontologic collections began with Andreas
Wagner as first curator, followed by Albert Oppel. These men
brought together the collections of Graf Miinster Hiberlein Obern-
dorfer, Herzog von Leuchtenberg, Hohenegger, etc. Since then
Zittel has enormously increased the Munich collection in all diree-
tions. Of ammonites, Zittel’s Collection contains more than 2.600
forms, and this is but one of many examples that could be cited to
show its great richness.‘ Thirty-seven and one-half years ago Zittel
took charge of this collection. Toward its development he at first
labored alone; later he had one and finally three assistants, and
comparatively little pecuniary means were at his disposal. He left
the Munich Paleontologic Museum the greatest in continental
Europe, the most universal in existence, and scientifically one of the
most famous and significant.”

In 1846 was begun the great German paleontologic periodical,
Palaeontographica, by Wilhelm Dunker and Hermann von Meyer.
After the death of von Meyer, in 1869, Zittel became one of the
editors, and since the death of Dunker, in 1885, he alone has directed
this publication. Not less than 70 different monographs based on
ihe Munich collections are by Zittel’s students and owe their origin
largely, if not entirely, to his stimulus. He “did not overshadow
the plodding student by adding his own name as joint author”
(Woodward).

Zittel devoted much of his time to teaching, regarding this work as
important as that of investigation. In furtherance of his instruc-
tion he wrote his Handbuch and Grundziige and created an additional
help in his 73 paleontological and geological wall charts. Of pale-
ontologic students who have studied in Zittel’s School not less than
110 are recorded in the Album of the Paleontological Institute. His
students are to be found in all European countries and in the Far
East and West. He never sought to influence them other than as
strenuous seekers after the truth. Each student of Zittel’s could and
must develop himself according to his own inclination and nature,
free from all theoretic influence and from all narrow, prescribed lim-
its of investigation. In but one direction did Zittel force his stu-

dents—to earnest work, to careful deliberation, to honest endeavor.
This school of Zittel’s still exists—large, widespread, and active in
all fields of paleontology, emulating the example of its master. And
this school has become the clear shining jewel in the crown of honor
of this great man.

“ Professor von Zittel naturally received numerous honors. Many
years ago he became a privy councilor, and from 1899 until his death
he was president of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences. He
was elected a foreign member of the Geological Society of London in
1889, and received the Wollaston medal in 1894. He was made a
foreign associate of the United-States National Academy of Sciences
in 1899, and a correspondent of the Paris Academy in 1900. His
greatest Joy was the ardent friendship with which he was honored
by his former pupils, scattered through nearly all the civilized nations
of the globe” (Woodward).

One monument Karl Alfred von Zittel has erected for himself in
his works, and another he has built, which has its foundation in the
hearts of his students and friends—eternal love and honor.

Dr. CARL GEGENBAUER.
CARL GEGENBAUR.*

3y Oscar HERTWwIG.

Of the great naturalists who have by their works given to the nine-
teenth century its characteristic Impress, another has been taken from
our midst, the recognized leader in the domain of comparative
anatomy of the vertebrates, the director of the morphological school
which has developed in Germany under his influence.

Carl Gegenbaur died on June 14, 1903, in Heidelberg, in his
seventy-seventh year, having some years previously relinquished his
active duties as professor of human anatomy on account of continued
illness. By his death the world has lost a peculiarly forceful and
striking scientific personality.

At a time when the tendency to specialize was rapidly advancing,
when through improved apparatus an almost Hee Gibic mass of
new facts was being added to our knowledge, and when particularly
the application of the microscope was completely revolutionizing
many pursuits, Gegenbaur was especially interested in its application
to anatomical science and in gathering together all known data and
formulating certain general laws concerning the structure of animals.
For this purpose he adopted methods of comparison which had
already been employed by Cuvier, Johannes Miiller, and others with
great success. It was his aim, by a critical correlation of isolated
facts, to elevate descriptive anatomy to the importance of a distinct
gcience, Which in contradistinction with physiology he was pleased to
call morphology.

Unhke many others, Gegenbaur throughout his life attached more
importance to methodical, systematic research than to isolated obser-
vations, however significant. The value and importance of the com-
parative method is particularly emphasized in the new Morpho-
logisches Jahrbuch (Morphological Yearbook), founded by him in
1875. “ The comparative method,” it states, “ depends essentially on
critical analysis, and constitutes a synthetic process by which the
results of critical treatment are brought together. This is to a large

extent peculiar to the branch of science founded by him, since the

method ean be dispensed with in other scientific researches. In itself
comparative anatomy is only the development of methodical com-
parison. To this end anatomy offers an experimental basis. There-
fore the significance of the method goes hand in hand with the ability
to apply it as rigorously as possible. This is accomphshed by taking
into consideration all characteristics and their logical value. If this
be not done, the method is uncritical and therefore unscientific.”

Gegenbaur often discussed this matter, and stated in the intro-
duction to his most important treatise, “The Cranial Skeleton of
Selachians ” (German), that in this critical examination and valua-
tion of anatomical facts there was httle in harmony with many
other contemporary endeavors, which not only assumed the accept-
unce of isolated occurrences as scientific proofs, but also regarded
every synthetical process of reasoning as erroneous.

At the time, this complaint may have had a certain warrant, for
during the last three decades the value of the comparative anatom-
ical method has not only been universally recognized, but it has
also been appled in many directions in anatomical and embryo-
logical researches.

The series of comprehensive monographs published by Gegenbaur
from 1864 to 1892 constitutes the foundation for a critical comparative
anatomical method based on an immense amount of material. The
most important of these, beyond question, is the monograph on the
Cranial Skeleton of the Selachians, published in 1872, a treatise
on our knowledge of the relationships of the schools of the ver-
tebrates. The well-known vertebral theory advanced by Oken and
Goethe, which was no longer defensible in its earlier form, is here
revised and enlarged into a comprehensive segment theory concern-
ing the head of the vertebrate applicable to different organic
systems.

In a similar manner Gegenbaur worked out from the beginning
almost the entire morphology of the vertebrate skeleton, in his
Observations on the Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrate Col-
umns in Amphibians and Reptiles (1862), in his paper on Carpus
and Tarsus (1864), on the Shoulder Girdle (1865), and on the
Occipital Region of Fishes (1887). THe had mastered also, as no
other naturalist, the material relating to the subject of vertebrate
morphology, and he imparted this knowledge in many unsurpassed
text-books prepared and published by him; in his Elements of Com-
parative Anatomy, which first appeared in 1859, of which a second
edition was issued in 1870, and which was later published in a con-
densed form, in 1874, as the Fundamental Principles of Comparative
Anatomy (second edition, 1878): and finally, in his most important
text-book, which embraced his further studies for ten years and rep-
CARL GEGENBAUR. 789

(

resented a compendium of his life’s researches, the Comparative
Anatomy of the Vertebrates as Compared with the Invertebrates.
Of this great work, which Gegenbaur had the pleasure of seeing
completed in the closing years of his life, the first volume appeared
in 1898, and the second in 1901, only two years before his death.

But Gegenbaur was not only a successful naturalist; he was also,
until the time of his death, an ardent teacher of human anatomy,
and was very popular with his pupils. This afforded him oppor-
tunity also to communieate the fruits of his scientific endeavors for
the advancement of anatomical study. There was such a demand
for his text-book of human anatomy that, published in 1883, it had
already reached its sixth edition in 1896. Convinced of the high
didactic value of the genetic method, he endeavored with its assist-
ance to add to the interest of the study of the human body and make
many of its relationships better understood. He desired, as set forth
by him in the fourth edition, “ through its application to anatomical
study to illuminate it.” “ Teaching means unfolding,” as he tersely
adds.

Although Gegenbaur did not possess the brilhant style of a Hyrtl,
and although his descriptions were often tedious and sometimes
difficult to comprehend, his text-book, on account of the substantial
nature of its contents, immediately obtained a wide circulation
among students, as is best attested by the rapidly appearing succes-
sive editions.

The biography of so distinguished a personality as Gegenbaur is

always of interest to his contemporaries and to posterity, and there
will doubtless be a number of biographical notices relating prin-
cipally to his scientific accomplishments. Gegenbaur himself has
given us, however, a small pamphlet with the title * Erlebtes und
KXrstrebtes ” (Life and Strife), a concise autobiography, the prepara-
tion of which gives evidence of approaching feebleness and_ retire-
ment from active service of the great savant, who no longer possessed
his accustomed vigor.
Carl Gegenbaur was born in Wiirzburg, on August 21, 1826, and
was the son of an official of good position. In consequence of vari-
ous assignments of his father, he spent the earlier years of his youth
in Weissenburg in Middle Franconia, and later in Arnstein in the
Rhén Mountains. Here in rural surroundings was developed the
foundation for his deep interest in nature, which was always a
prominent characteristic.

Gegenbaur secured his preparatory training in Wiirzburg, where
he graduated in 1845. In his biography he characterizes classic
literature as “the true friend” of his life’s career, since he was then,
as always, a decided opponent of the movement for reform by the
curtailing of classical studies.
790 CARL GEGENBAUR.

At the age of 19 Gegenbaur entered upon the study of medicine
and natural science at the University of Wurzburg, somewhat
against the wishes of his parents. though with the idea already con-
ceived of later becoming a naturalist. It was fortunate for him
that just at the time that he took up his studies, Witirzburg had its
most brillant era in medical science. Ko6lhker and Virchow, two
world-renowned men of science, were there, in their prime, as were
also such excellent assistants as Leydig and Heinrich Miiller.

After attaining the doctor’s degree (April 15, 1851), for which
he competed with Kolliker, and after completing his medical studies,
Gegenbaur could not make up his mind to enter upon the practice
of medicine, although he had served for a few semesters as assist-
ant to his friend Friedreich on the resident staff of the Julius hos-
pital. It was his ardent desire to become a naturalist and to enter
upon a university career. Before he installed himself as private
instructor, however, he experienced what he himself terms in his
autobiography, a “period of wandering years.” He journeyed
through North Germany, where in Berlin he made the acquaintance
of Johannes Miiller. He pursued hurriedly for some weeks a study
of the marine animals of Helgoland, and then embarked on an
important scientific journey to Italy and Sicily, in which he was
encouraged by Kolker, who himself was undertaking with Heinrich
Miiller certain zoological investigations in Messina. After Switzer-
land and Ttaly had been traversed, Gegenbaur arrived with his
friends in Messina, and occupied the fall and winter months in a
zoological study of Messina’s wonderful sea fauna. A journey
through Sicily, followed by prolonged stays in Naples, Rome, and
northern Italy, brought the “ wandering years” to a close, which
period, according to his own statement, constitutes an important
epoch in the life of the great savant.

In 1854 Gegenbaur was installed in Wiirzburg as private in-
structor of the medical faculty, and taught for three sessions the
subject of zoology.

From here he was ealled as early as 1856 as extraordinary pro-
fessor to Jena, as successor to Oscar Schmidt, and as soon thereafter
the famous anatomist Huschke died, he succeeded to the latter's
position as regular professor of human anatomy in the medical
faculty, which position he occupied until his call to Heidelberg in
1873. “Jena,” Gegenbaur states in his autobiography, “was for
me in every respect a high school, in which I received knowledge
in many directions, and everything which I have later accomplished
had there its origin and gives me reason for lasting thanks. I regard
it as most fortunate for me to have remained for so long a time in
Jena in my youth, the influence of which stay is indelibly impressed
upon me.”
CARL GEGENBAUR. 791

On the recommendation of Gegenbaur, Ernst Haeckel was also
appointed a private instructor in Jena. Between these two natural-
ists, working along the same lines, each in his own way as an ener-
getic promoter of Darwin’s new doctrine of evolution, there grew a
firm friendship, which is testified to in glowing words by Haeckel in
the introduction to his General Morphology.

In Jena the writer had the good fortune, as a student in the first
medical semester, to become somewhat intimately acquainted with
these two closely associated great naturalists, receiving instructions
in anatomy and zoology, and being prepared by them in various ways
for his later vocation, for which aid he will ever feel thankful.

Although united by many bonds to Jena, Gegenbaur, though only
after long hesitation, accepted the call to Heidelberg as successor of
Arnold (1873). “It carried him to the south, whence he had come.”
Other calls which followed later, to Amsterdam and to the newly-
established university at Strassburg, were declined. He _ possessed,
however, in Heidelberg everything that he could wish—a limited
course of instruction in a magnificently equipped university, which in
the more congenial southern part of Germany gave him leisure for
uninterrupted progressive scientific work; and in his own home a
happy family life which came from his marriage in Jena, after the
death of his first wife, to the daughter of the anatomist Arnold.

The great naturalist was in all respects an admirable man, who
quickly gained the love and respect of all with whom he became in
any wise intimately associated. Resolute and uninfluenced by super-
ficial things, he held firmly to that which he had by close scrutiny
found to be true and just. Exacting with himself and others, he
sought in close application to his work the happiness of life. Though
cvincing a warm and generous appreciation of the beautiful things in
nature and art, he was naturally of a retiring disposition, inclined to
avoid social gatherings, and enly occasionally attended congresses and
scientific meetings. Easily repelled by strangers, and at times per-
haps harsh and inconsiderate, yet he possessed a sympathetic spirit,
which often showed itself in most unexpected ways to those intimately
known to him. For this reason, Gegenbaur’s assistants were attached
to him with rare love and devotion, and under his leadership felt
themselves firmly bound to his school of morphology. |
