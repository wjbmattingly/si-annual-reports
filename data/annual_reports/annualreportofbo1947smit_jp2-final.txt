REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

ALEXANDER WETMORE
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1947

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GrenTLEMEN : I have the honor to submit herewith my report showing
the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and its
bureaus during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947. Appendixes 1 to
12 give detailed reports of the operations of the National Museum, the
National Gallery of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts, the
Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Inter-
national Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical
Observatory, the National Air Museum, the Canal Zone Biological
Area, the Smithsonian library, and of the publications issued under
the direction of the Institution. On page 162 is the financial report of
the executive committee of the Board of Regents.

The purpose of the Institution, as stated in the will of its founder,
is “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” The in-
crease of knowledge is accomplished by means of scientific research
and exploration, the diffusion of knowledge by its several series of
publications, its International Exchange Service, its museum and art
gallery exhibits, and various other means. As the Institution oper-
ates chiefly through the bureaus that have grown up around it as a
result of its early work, the year’s research and exploration will be
found recorded in the reports of those bureaus, particularly the Na-
tional Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Astro-
physical Observatory. A complete account of the year’s publications
appears in the report of the chief of the editorial division, appendix 12.

The fiscal year here reported upon is the first in the Institution’s
second century of existence. At the beginning of a new era, it is
gratifying to report that a large part of the normal research and field
work that had to be suspended during the war is now being resumed
and, in certain lines, expanded. This is the first annual account in
which appear reports on the newly established National Air Museum
and on the Canal Zone Biological Area, recently placed under the In-
stitution’s administration. The number of visitors to the National
Museum, the Freer Gallery of Art, and the National Zoological Park

1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

is back to prewar levels, as is the number of accessions to the Museum
collections. The International Exchange Service has made large
inroads into the great accumulation of material for foreign exchange
that built up during the war years, and the service will soon be again
on a wholly current basis.

The two greatest needs of the Institution as stated in my last report
are for more personnel and more building space. New buildings must,
of course, await more propitious economic conditions, but plans are
already outlined and the future outlook is hopeful. Strong presenta-
tions of the personnel shortage, particularly in scientific positions, are
being made to the Bureau of the Budget and to Congress, with promise
of relief in this direction also.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846,
according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of England, who
in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to
found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution,
an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress
determined that the Federal Government was without authority to ad-
minister the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted an “establish-
ment” whose statutory members are “the President, the Vice President,
the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

During the year the following changes occurred in the personnel
of the Board of Regents:

January 17, 1947: Chief Justice Vinson was elected Chancellor of
the Institution.

January 27, 1947: Representative John M. Vorys, of Ohio, was
appointed to finish the unexpired term of Representative B. Carroll
Reece.

January 27, 1947: Representative Samuel K. McConnell, Jr., of
Pennsylvania, was appointed to finish the unexpired term of Repre-
sentative E. E. Cox.

The roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year June 30, 1947, was
as follows:

Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Chancellor; members from the Senate,
Alben W. Barkley, Wallace H. White, Jr., Walter F. George; mem-
bers from the House of Representatives, Clarence Cannon, John M.
Vorys, Samuel K. McConnell, Jr. ; citizen members, Frederic A. Delano,
Washington, D. C., Harvey N. Davis, New Jersey, Arthur H. Comp-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

ton, Missouri, Vannevar Bush, Washington, D. C., and Frederic C.
Walcott, Connecticut.

Proceedings.—The Board of Regents held its annual meeting on
January 17, 1947, with the following members present : Senator Walter
F. George, Representative Clarence Cannon, Dr. Vannevar Bush, Dr.
Arthur H. Compton, Dr. Harvey N. Davis, Frederic A. Delano, the
Secretary, Dr. Alexander Wetmore, and the Assistant Secretary, John
E. Graf.

The Secretary presented his annual report covering the activities
of the parent institution and of its several branches, including the
financial report of the Executive Committee, for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1946, which was accepted by the Board. The usual resolution
authorizing the expenditure by the Secretary of the income of the
Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1948, was adopted by
the Board.

The gift of Miss Annie-May Hegeman was mentioned last year
as amounting in total to $300,000, being one-half the amount from
the sale of the Porter property at the corner of Sixteenth and Eye
Streets NW. The Library Trust Fund Board of the Library of Con-
gress, which handled this matter, during the year forwarded a check
for $275,000 on this account, approximately $25,000 being held tempo-
rarily, pending settlement of claim for sales commission on the part
of real-estate brokers.

John A. Roebling made a generous gift to the Institution in further
support of the work of the Astrophysical Observatory.

On August 12, 1946, President Truman signed the act (Public Law
722) establishing the National Air Museum under the Smithsonian
Institution. Under this act there is set up an advisory board com-
posed of the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, the Chief
of Naval Operations, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
and two citizens appointed by the President. General Spaatz, Chief
of the Army Air Forces, has designated Maj. Gen. Edward M. Powers
to represent him; Admiral Nimitz, Chief of Naval Operations, desig-
nated Rear Adm. H. B. Sallada; and the President, early in December,
appointed Grover Loening and William B. Stout, both well known for
their work in aviation, as the citizen members of the board. Subse-
quently, Admiral Nimitz assigned Rear Adm. Sallada to other duties
and designated Rear Adm. A. M. Pride to represent him on the board.

The first meeting of the Advisory Board was held December 16,
1946, at which the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was elected
Chairman. Discussions covered the scope, probable size, and location
of the Museum. It was the opinion that these could be determined
only after a complete survey of material of value for the Museum.
The Chairman was instructed to prepare estimates for the $50,000
4. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

authorized by the act for a survey, this to cover the latter part of the
fiscal year 1947, and the year 1948, and to include travel funds and
necessary assistance. In view of the great growth in aviation the new
agency is one of major importance for preservation of historical ma-
terial in aeronautics, both for public display and for study and exam-
ination by engineers and students of aerodynamics.

Under Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946, which became effective
July 16, 1946, the President placed under the direction of the Smith-
sonian Institution the biological laboratory known as the Canal Zone
Biological Area located in the Canal Zone, Panama. When Gatun
Lake was formed during construction of the Panama Canal, the im-
pounded waters flowed around hills that stood in the valley, changing
certain of them to islands. One of these, which became known as
Barro Colorado Island, was notable for its fine stand of primitive
tropical forest, and for the animal life confined on it by the waters
of the lake. On April 17, 1923, Gov. Jay J. Morrow of the Canal
Zone set aside Barro Colorado Island as a reserve, and on it there was
established a field laboratory at which investigators might live and
work on scientific problems concerned with a tropical jungle. This
laboratory has been supported by small contributions from various
agencies, including Harvard College, the University of Michigan, the
Smithsonian Institution, and various others.

So much valuable scientific work came from this laboratory that the
Congress set it aside permanently as a reserve under the name Canal
Zone Biological Area, in an act effective July 2, 1940, as an independ-
ent agency under a Board of Directors composed of the Secretaries of
War, Agriculture, Interior, and the Smithsonian Institution, the
President of the National Academy of Sciences, and three distin-
guished biologists appointed by the President of the National Academy
as Chairman of the Board. In the process of unification of govern-
mental agencies, the Canal Zone Biological Area has now become a
part of the Smithsonian, where it will be administered under the office
of the Secretary. The reorganization plan abolished the former Board
as the controlling body, but it has seemed desirable to continue this
as an advisory board composed of representatives of the departments
originally concerned, to secure desired support and cooperation for
the activity.

Barro Colorado Island has been the site of a wide variety of studies
and tests under tropical conditions. Those under way at the present
time include an extensive set-up for testing termite-proofing of wood
samples, tropical deterioration of plywoods, textiles, and packaging
containers, and the effect of fungi on optical glass. Biologists come
regularly to the island to make studies of the fauna and flora. Some
400 publications have been issued on research carried on here in the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

fields of entomology, forestry, and medicine, with special reference to
the control of termites, fruit flies, and mosquitoes.

The annual report of the Smithsonian Art Commission was pre-
sented by the Secretary and accepted by the Board. The Commis-
sion, at its meeting on December 6, 1946, accepted several works of
art, including 23 miniatures. A resolution was adopted to reelect
the following members for 4-year terms: John Taylor Arms, Gifford
Beal, and Gilmore D. Clarke. Vacancies on the commission were
caused by the resignations of Louis Ayres and Frank J. Mather. The
names of William T. Aldrich and Lloyd Goodrich, recommended by
the Commission, were approved to fill the above vacancies. The fol-
lowing officers were reelected for the ensuing year: Chairman, Paul
Manship; Secretary, Alexander Wetmore.

The bill that was introduced in the House of Representatives (H. R.
2015 and H. Res. 139, 78th Cong., 2d sess.) for the relief of the estate
of John Gellatly and/or Charleyne Whiteley Gellatly, his widow, was
referred by the House, mentioned above as House Resolution 139, to
the Court of Claims to ascertain the facts and make recommendations.
The Court of Claims in an opinion dated May 5, 1947, stated that “there
is no basis in law or in equity to set aside the gift or transfer and no
basis in law or equity to allow a recovery in behalf of the Gellatly
estate.”

The Secretary brought to the attention of the Board the proposition
to request the Civil Service Commission to extend the provisions of
the Federal Classification Act to Smithsonian employees paid from
trust funds. This proposal was approved by the Board under certain
conditions.

trustees; and $432,500 was provided in the District of Columbia ap-
propriation bill for the operation of the National Zoological Park.
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Besides these direct appropriations, the Institution received funds
by transfer from other Federal agencies, as follows:

From the State Department, from the appropriation, Cooperation
with the American Republics, 1947, a total of $139,589 for the follow-
ing purposes: Operation of the Institute of Social Anthropology, in-
cluding the issuance of publications resulting from its work; publica-
tion of a Spanish edition of Compendium and Description of the West
Indies, by Antonio Vazquez de Espinosa; and assistance in the pub-
lication of the Handbook of South American Indians.

From the Navy Department, $12,920 for scientific work in the Bikini
area In connection with Operation Crossroads.

From the National Park Service, Interior Department, $91,500 for
archeological projects in connection with River Basin Surveys. Of
this total, $64,500 was originally transferred to the Park Service by
the Bureau of Reclamation, and $37,000 by the Corps of Engineers,
U.S. Army.

SMITHSONIAN CENTENNIAL

In my last annual report I reviewed rather fully the features that
marked the Institution’s one-hundredth anniversary on August 10,
1946. These included a commemorative Smithsonian postage stamp;
an illustrated publication entitled “The First Hundred Years of the
Smithsonian Institution”; a convocation and reception at the Insti-
tution on October 23, 1946, to mark the occasion in a more formal
manner; a public statement released to the press by President Harry
S. Truman, who is ex-officio Presiding Officer of the Institution; and
a Smithsonian Centennial issue of the journals, Science and The Scien-
tific Monthly. In addition, many leading magazines and newspapers
carried full accounts of the Institution’s history and achievements, and
this type of public notice of the Centennial continued well into the
fiscal year 1947.

It has been particularly gratifying to the officials of the Institution
to receive on the occasion of the Centennial so many letters of con-
gratulation from distinguished scientists and educators in this country
and abroad. It is satisfying to feel that there is a general recognition
of the Institution’s earnest efforts to carry out its founder’s stipula-
tion for “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” and
such recognition tends to stimulate greater zeal in furthering James
Smithson’s purpose.

FINANCES
A statement on finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian

private funds, will be found in the report of the executive committee
of the Board of Regents, page 162.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 7

TRUST FUNDS’ EMPLOYEES INCLUDED UNDER FEDERAL RETIREMENT
SYSTEM

For many years employees of the Institution have been divided into
two categories: The first, and by far the larger group, consists of
civil-service employees paid from Federal appropriations; the second,
now numbering some 35 employees, consists of employees paid wholly
or in part from Smithsonian trust funds. The first group, of course,
has been covered by the Federal Retirement System; the second group
had up to 1939 no provision whatever for retirement. On July 1,
1939, the Smithsonian Retirement System was put into effect to pro-
vide retirement benefits for those employees paid from trust funds, but
the number of members was so small that the system was unable to
offer anything like as liberal benefits as the Federal System as
amended in 1942.

During the fiscal year 1947, the Civil Service Commission took under
advisement the inclusion of trust funds’ employees under the Federal
System, and pending a decision, the Board of Regents of the Institu-
tion at its annual meeting on January 17, 1947, passed the following
resolution :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution do hereby
consent to the officers and members of the Smithsonian Institution paid from
trust funds accepting the benefits and privileges of the Federal Retirement Sys-
tem, aS well as assuming the obligations and duties legally applicable to them
under that system as presently constituted; Provided further,

That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution does not consent
to the application of the Federal civil-service laws, nor the Federal Classification
Act of 1923, as amended, to such officers and members paid from trust funds, nor
to the application of any other laws which would in any way contravene the act
of Hstablishment of the Smithsonian Institution approved on August 10, 1846,
with amendments thereto.

Resolved, That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, if and when officers
and members of the Smithsonian Institution paid from trust funds are placed
under the Federal Retirement System, approve in principle the use of the funds
now held in the Smithsonian Retirement Fund for the benefit of the employees in
question, to secure for said employees the maximum protection under the Federal
Retirement Act to which their length of service in the Smithsonian Institution,
respectively, entitles them; and that the Secretary be authorized to work out
. the necessary plans to carry this into effect, with the approval of the executive
committee, to which is given full power to act in this matter.

A decision was reached by the Commission on May 16, and on May
22 I sent the following memorandum to the members of the Smith-
sonian Retirement System:

The Civil Service Commission has decided under date of May 16, 1947, that
Smithsonian employees paid from trust funds of the Institution are eligible for
inclusion under the Federal Retirement System. In accordance with the ap-

proval of the Board of Regents, the Smithsonian Retirement System is therefore
abolished, effective at the close of business May 17, 1947, except insofar as it

TT7488—48——_2
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

affects payments to members in annuity status on that date, which payments
will be continued by the Institution as provided by the Smithsonian Retirement
System.

Beginning May 18, 1947, retirement deductions from the pay of the Smith-
sonian employees in question will be made at the rate of 5 percent (the rate of
the Federal Retirement System) instead of 3.5 percent (the rate of the former
Smithsonian Retirement System).

Adjustment for back time on behalf of the individual members of the Smith-
sonian Retirement System will be determined with the approval of the executive
committee, as provided by resolution adopted by the Board of Regents on January
17, 1947.

On June 30, the last day of the fiscal year 1947, I submitted to the
executive committee of the Board of Regents a detailed recommenda-
tion regarding the conversion to the Federal Retirement System, so
that final action on adjustment for previous service will be deferred
until the next fiscal year. However, all employees of the Institution
are now on the same footing as to retirement benefits, thus remedying

a situation of long standing.
VISITORS

An increase of 237,784 visitors to the Smithsonian buildings was
recorded over the previous year, the totals being 2,353,377 for 1947
and 2,115,593 for 1946. August 1946 was the month of largest at-
tendance, with 318,325 visitors; April 1947, the second largest with
298,724. A summary of attendance records is given in table 1:

PHOTOGRAPHIC LABORATORY

In connection with the research and exploration of the Institution,
there is involved a large amount of photographic work which is han-
dled for the Institution and its branches by the Photographic Labora-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

tory, located in the Arts and Industries Building of the National
Museum. To show the quantity of work produced I will give a few
statistics: Negatives made, 2,449; prints, 14,521; enlargements, 2,082;
lantern slides, 264; cloth mounts, 174; also a smaller number of other
types of work involving photographic processes.

In addition to the routine operations of the laboratory, the staff
spent considerable time in assisting scientists of the Institution in ob-
taining photographic illustrations for their publications, as well as in
aiding representatives of other governmental agencies and private
individuals in their search for needed photographs.

The photographer in charge served as the Institution’s representa-
tive on the photograph supplies committee, Federal Specifications
Board. He attended monthly board meetings and conducted special
investigations for various subcommittees of the Board. While rep-
resenting the Institution at the annual convention of the Photogra-
phers’ Association of America in Chicago, the photographer in charge
visited the Chicago Natural History Museum in the search for im-
proved methods of photographing art objects, silverware, and glass-
ware.

The greatest needs of the laboratory are a complete catalog of file
prints, so that the large and valuable collection of negatives would be
more readily accessible to the Institution’s staff as well as to the gen-
eral public; certain items of modern photographic equipment; and the
fitting up of a room to be devoted to color photography.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Repairs and alterations—Among important projects in connection
with the several buildings, the following were completed during the
year:

Smithsonian Building: The metal finials on top of the northeast and
southeast towers were removed and new copper finials were installed;
removal of the wooden louvres on four sides of the flag tower (begun
in 1946) was completed and new copper louvres were installed in their
place; the rooms formerly occupied by the property clerk were dis-
mantled and converted into additional space for the accounting office.

Arts and Industries Building: Provision was made for office rooms
for the National Air Museum by partitioning off room 30, formerly
occupied by the division of engineering; major alterations and repairs
were made in the southwest and west south ranges to provide exhibit
areas for the section of manufactures and the section of aeronautics
(now the National Air Museum) ; a photographic dark room was con-
structed in the section of photography; the coin hall ceiling and walls
were repaired and repainted and all exhibit cases were revarnished.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Natural History Building: All alcoves in the foyer, where all
special exhibitions are held, were re-covered with monks cloth and
all exposed woodwork repainted; to provide storage and working
space for the coral collection, a section of the second floor at the
northwest corner was remodeled, including changing partition walls,
erection of a gallery, and painting of walls, ceiling, and storage
cases.

Freer Gallery of Art: The photographic studio and dark room
were constructed by remodeling a section of one of the existing stor-
age rooms.

Heat, light, and power.—HElectric current used during the year
amounted to 1,664,710 kilowatt-hours. This figure represents an
increase of 120,571 kilowatt-hours over 1946 despite the “brown-
out” during the period November 23 to December 9, 1946, for the
purpose of conserving coal during the miners’ strike. However,
this increase is not considered excessive because additional fixtures
were added and other improvements were made during the year.

Steam consumption was held to the absolute minimum require-
ments during the year, and despite the fact that heating temperatures
were reduced 5° twice each day during the period November 23 to
December 9, 1946, steam consumption increased 1,502,900 pounds
over 1946. This increase was due to lower outside temperatures dur-
ing the heating season. Total steam consumption for the fiscal year
was 54,902,700 pounds.

Ice production—The Smithsonian ice plant produced 186.7 tons
of ice at a cost of $1.16 per ton, exclusive of labor. The plant was
closed down 10 days during May 1947 for overhauling.

Fire protection —tThe fire hose, couplings, nozzles, and hose racks
purchased during fiscal year 1946 were received and installed in the
Smithsonian Building. Plans have been made to install a central
control station for valving the standpipe lines in this building dur-
ing the fiscal year 1948. Inspections of apparatus were made each
month, and all soda and acid extinguishers were discharged and
recharged.

Respectfully submitted.

A. Wermorsg, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condition
and operation of the United States National Museum for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1947.

COLLECTIONS

Nearly 757,000 specimens, about twice as many as last year, came to
the Museum’s collections during the year, these being divided among
the various departments as follows: Anthropology, 9,445; biology,
533,098; geology, 205,549; engineering and industries, 5,239; history,
3,539. Most of the accessions were acquired as gifts from individuals
or as transfers from Government departments and agencies. The
complete report on the Museum, published as a separate document,
includes a detailed list of the year’s acquisitions, of which the more im-
portant are summarized below. Catalog entries in all departments
now total 19,561,872.

Anthropology.—Archeological material came from many parts of
the world, especially noteworthy being about a hundred items from
Adak Island in the Aleutians; nearly 1,600 specimens from Mont-
gomery County, Md.; a tripod bowl from a ruin near Oaxaca, Mexico;
2 earthenware bowls from the Taino site of La Caleto, Province of
Trujillo, Dominican Republic; 2 Roman or Franko vessels from
Speicher, Germany; and 14 stone implements and fragments from
Larimer County, Colo.

In ethnology, the year’s accessions included collections from the
North American tribes of Alaska and the Aleutians, Eastern Wood-
lands, Great Plains, and the Southwest; the Indian tribes of México,
Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia, and Brazil; the Oceanian
peoples of Hawaii and New Guinea; the aboriginal tribes of Australia;
the Indonesians of Java, Sumatra, and Bali; the Asiatic peoples of
India and Mongolia; and the African tribes of the Belgian Congo and
neighboring parts of West Africa. A collection of major importance
was received as a result of the bequest of the late Princess Abigail W.
Kawananakoa of Honolulu, comprising a well-documented group of
masterpieces of Hawaiian handicrafts which were heirlooms of the
Hawaiian royal family. <A valuable collection of American historical
Staffordshire china was received from an anonymous donor.

11
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

The most unusual accession in physical anthropology consisted of
unpublished anthropometric and other data collected by German
anthropologists in Poland during World War II, together with some
of their anthropological measuring instruments. The data had been
assembled for the Institut fiir Deutsche Ostarbeit and were trans-
ferred to the National Museum as a permanent loan by the War De-
partment. The material includes information on 356 Ukrainians,
1,466 Poles, and 162 Huzuls, with full measurements, photographs,
and personal, medical, and family histories of each subject.

Biology.—The most important mammalian accession was a series of
about 600 glass slides of sectioned hairs, collected and presented by
Dr. Ned Dearborn, expert on fur-bearing animals, who has made a
special study of mammalian hair. The W. L. Abbott fund made
possible three noteworthy avian accessions: 1,758 skins and skeletons
of birds from Colombia, collected by M. A. Carriker, Jr.; 453 bird
skins and 7 skeletons of Panama birds, collected by Dr. A. Wetmore
and W. M. Perrygo; and 556 birds from India, collected by Salim Ali.
Also from India came 1,500 bird skins resulting from the Smithsonian
Institution-Yale University Expedition, containing many forms new
to the Museum. Foremost among the year’s herpetological acquisi-
tions were 25 rare Brazilian frogs, 112 reptiles from Bikini, and 5
series of reptiles and amphibians from Colombia, Bolivia, Haiti, and
Guatemala.

Two large and outstanding collections of fishes were received as a
result of the Smithsonian’s participation in two federally sponsored
projects—about 38,700 fishes (representing over 300 species) taken
during Operation Crossroads at Bikini and in the northern Marshall
Islands by Dr. Leonard P. Schultz and Capt. Earl S. Herald, and
28,000 Guatemalan fishes obtained by Associate Curator Robert R.
Miller in continuation of the survey of the fishery resources of Guate-
mala begun last year under the auspices of the Guatemalan Govern-
ment, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Smith-
sonian Institution. The Pacific material, because of its extent, will
make it possible for the first time to make a study of anatomical varia-
tions among the various island fish populations, while the Guatemalan
material is one of the best collections of fresh-water fishes ever made
in Central America. In addition, smaller but important lots of fishes
came from Argentina, Baja California, Cuba, and the Tropical Pacific.

About 12,000 insects, in three accessions, came to the Museum as a
direct result of the war: 1,500 from the Philippines and New Guinea,
collected by Carl O. Mohr; 4,500 from the Philippines, collected by
Dr. Frank M. Young; and 6,000 mosquitoes, resulting from the in-
vestigations in the South Pacific by the Naval Medical Research Unit
No. 2. Another large insect accession was the gift of the H. G. Bar-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

ber collection of Hemiptera, amounting to 35,000 specimens and in-
cluding some types and paratypes. Other important entomological
material included over 2,500 insects from Colombia, collected by
Curator E. A. Chapin in 1946; about 2,000 insects collected by Dr.
J. P. E. Morrison as a part of Operation Crossroads biological investi-
gations; nearly 400 aquatic insects collected in Guatemala by Dr.
Robert R. Miller; about 16,000 specimens of Mexican and Canal Zone
insects collected by N. L. H. Krauss; and 65,000 specimens transferred
from the United States Department of Agriculture.

A great variety of marine invertebrates was received but the largest
accession in this division was the gift of the Horton H. Hobbs private
collection of crayfishes. Comprising about 11,000 specimens, it is by
far the most important series of these crustaceans ever collected from
the southeastern United States. The Operation Crossroads investi-
gations yielded over 8,000 miscellaneous marine invertebrates from
the Marshall Islands. A desirable personal collection of nearly
3,000 worms and crustaceans from various localities came as a gift
from the collector, Leslie Hubricht. The type collection of Foram-
inifera was increased by 706 slides, bringing the total in this col-
lection to 10,640 slides. In the division of mollusks the largest and
most important of the year’s accessions comprised about 200,000 speci-
mens collected by Associate Curator Morrison in the biological recon-
naissance of the Marshall Islands in connection with Operation Cross-
roads. The Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2 turned over to the
Museum 25,000 specimens, mainly of land and fresh-water mollusks,
from China, the Philippines, and the Marianas. Dr. A. R. Loeblich,
Jr., now a member of the staff of the department of geology, donated
1,200 marine shells from Okinawa.

Accessions in the division of plants (including diatoms) aggregated
nearly 44,000 specimens, from many parts of the world. About 4,800
plants came as a result of Associate Curator Morton’s botanical field
work in St. Vincent, Lesser Antilles, a region heretofore but scantily
represented in the National Herbarium. In transfers from the United
States Department of Agriculture, the Museum received 5,500 grasses
from Brazil, collected by Jason R. Swallen, and 1,500 specimens of
bamboos, collected by Dr. F. A. McClure. Several other large lots
came from South America, the West Indies, Japan and Formosa,
the South Pacific, and several parts of North America.

Geology.—The department of geology received about 41% times as
many specimens as last year, this increase being due largely to a great
influx of invertebrate fossils to the number of about 200,000.

Additions in mineralogy and petrology were somewhat fewer than
usual, though gifts, exchanges, and purchases brought some fine new
minerals, gems, and meteorites to the collections. Twenty-one meteor-
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

ites not previously represented in the Museum were received during
the year. Forty-four mineral specimens were purchased through the
Canfield fund.

Collecting trips by Dr. G. A. Cooper and Dr. A. R. Loeblich, Jr.,
yielded over 36,000 Paleozoic fossils for the invertebrate collections.
Several gifts received were important in helping to fill the study series
in invertebrate paleontology and paleobotany. Among these were 85
Mississippian ammonoids from Arkansas, numerous Lower Permian
specimens from New Mexico, extensive collections of Middle Devonian
invertebrates, excellent Eocene echinoids from Florida, 120 blocks of
Cambrian and Ordovician limestone with choice silicified brachiopods
from the Arbuckle Mountains, 275 Tertiary fossils from Florida, ex-
tensive sets of Paleozoic and Cretaceous inverterbrates, including many
micro-organisms and bryozoans, 375 specimens of unusual Cambrian
and Lower Ordovician fossils from Quebec, 4,000 Upper Devonian
fossils from New Mexico, and 2,000 Paleozoic invertebrates from
Virginia, and a similar collection from Georgia.

Resumption of field work following the war also brought increased
material to the division of vertebrate paleontology. Outstanding was
the discovery in one block in the Bridger Eocene beds of the skulls
and portions of the skeletons of two unusually large rodents of the
genus Paramys. Among other rarities in the season’s finds were jaws
and skeletal parts of the artiodactyl Helohyus, about five examples of
the minute insectivore Myctitherium, and remains of the marsupial
Peratherium. Other additions to the Bridger collections made by
Dr. C. L. Gazin were skulls of the large six-horned mammal Uznta-
therium, the titanothere Palaeosyops, and the rhinoceros Hyrachyus.
Among the materials transferred from the United States Geological
Survey was a nearly complete skull and jaws of a Triassic reptile, a
phytosaur, from the Petrified Forest of Arizona.

Engineering and industries.—In the division of engineering an out-
standing accession was the motor tricycle designed and built at Pitts-
burgh in 1897 by Louis S. Clarke, automobile pioneer, and claimed
to be the first Autocar. Several ship models received enhanced the
watercraft collection. Two accessions in the field of microscopy are
of unusual interest: The curious ruling machine with which Charles
Fasoldt, in the mid-nineteenth century, produced the ruled slides and
gratings prized over all others by many well-known microscopists;
and a group of microscopes and accessories collected by the late Dr.
Richard Halsted Ward, first president or the American Microscopical
Society, and his son, the late Dr. Henry Baldwin Ward, parasitologist.

A historically important accession in the division of crafts and
industries was one of the two original rubber masticators developed
by Thomas Hancock in England prior to 1830. The machine was in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

continual use in rubber manufacture in England for more than 75
years. To the section of textiles there came many outstanding ex-
amples of new fabrics and fabric application and an exhibit showing
the manufacture and uses of nylon. In wood technology 964 exotic
woods were received as an exchange from the Forest Products Research
Laboratory of Great Britain, most of them heretofore unrepresented
in the section’s collections. In addition, 182 wood specimens were
received from the New York State College of Forestry and 561 photo-
micrographic prints of sections of Japanese woods from the War
Department.

In the division of graphic arts the most notable accession of the year
was a microengraving machine capable of engraving the Lord’s Prayer
781,250 times within a square-inch area. This miraculous contrivance
was constructed by the Rev. J. C. Crawford after the original machine
invented by W. Peters in London in 1852. Outstanding pieces of
motion-picture equipment received included a 60-mm. camera invented
in 1893 by George Demeny of France and manufactured by the Gau-
mont Co. around 1896; a 16-mm. Bell & Howell gun-type camera
adopted and used by the Navy to photograph the earth from a German
V-2 rocket fired at the Army Ordnance Proving Grounds, White
Sands, N. Mex., October 10, 1946; and a 1911 Pathé Fréres 35-mm.
hand-operated projector. Sixty glass negatives taken in the late nine-
teenth century by the photographer Robert Stead and 143 lantern
slides taken by the photographer Titus B. Snoddy, Sr., came as gifts
to the Museum. Five more etched copper plates were added to the
Charles W. Dahlgreen group for printing under the Dahlgreen fund.

Several interesting and desirable additions were received for the
division of medicine and public health, the most valuable one of the
year being a series of specially prepared transparencies illustrating the
subject of hospitalization. These were made and contributed by the
American Hospital Association as a memorial to the late Dr. S. S.
Goldwater (1873-1942). Historically important is a “Grosse Flamme”
X-ray machine with tube and tube stand, one of the earliest American-
made machines of its kind.

A number of desiderata found their way to the aeronautical collec-
tions, the most outstanding in point of historic importance being the
collection of parts remaining of original gliders devised by John J.
Montgomery between 1905 and 1911. From the standpoint of rela-
tionship to air warfare and particularly the devastating effect of
bombing as practiced in World War II, the Norden bombsight used
in directing the first atomic bomb dropped over Japan constitutes an
important accession. A series of 82 interesting scale-model World
War IJ airplanes were transferred from the Navy Department. Three
other aircraft models received were of an XFL-1 Bell “Airabonita”
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

made by Leroy McCallum, an F-6-F Grumman “Hellcat” made in the

History.—Several interesting additions made to the costumes col-
lection include a waistcoat and knee breeches of mauve satin and a dark
blue and white silk waistcoat worn by Simon Serre in Cette, France,
as a page boy about the mid-eighteenth century; a child’s dress and
pair of shoes of about 18503 a black silk dress of about 1860, a trousseau
of 1875; and a white satin dress worn in the White House by Mrs.
John Quincy Adams during her husband’s administration as Presi-
dent. Added to the military collections were early nineteenth-century
chapeaux, epaulets, sash, coat, and trousers; a United States Marine
Corps officer’s sword of the early part of the present century; and two
Chinese scrolls that had been presented to Gen. James H. Doolittle in
commemoration of the American air raid on Tokyo in 1942. From
the White House there was transferred a historic passenger elevator in-
stalled in 1902. The numismatic collection was increased by 30 speci-
mens of 1946 United States bronze, nickel, and silver coins and by 400
pieces of German paper currency of the World War I period. About
3,000 stamps were added to the philatelic collection, about 1,300 more
than last year. Of particular interest was a sheet of 50 3-cent Smith-
sonian Centennial commemoratives, formally presented to the Institu-
tion by the Post Office Department at a special ceremony on August 10,
1946.

EXPLORATION AND FIELD WORK

One of the most encouraging phases of the Museum’s work during
the year was an opportunity to resume field work, interrupted by the
war.

Under a grant from Ernest N. May, it was possible for the curator
of ethnology, Herbert W. Krieger, to renew investigations of fifteenth-
century historic Indian village sites and some of the early Spanish set-
tlements in the West Indies. This Caribbean program developed from
an earlier Antillean project sponsored by the late Dr. W. L. Abbott
which began in 1928 and was terminated in 1988. Dr. Abbott’s inter-
est was aroused by the earlier discoveries there by W. H. Gabb in
1869-71 of kitchen middens containing deposits of animal bones and
aboriginal pottery fragments. While engaged in the development of
the ensuing Smithsonian project for the excavation of these cave
middens and of other former Indian village sites in the Greater An-
tilles and in the Bahamas, the need became apparent to the curator
for a chronological culture-trait analysis and for a more complete ori-
entation as to the location of historic Indian village sites, and also
for a study of Spanish settlements associated with the early colonial
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 17

period of the area. The cooperation of scientists and the governments
of the Bahama Islands, Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic was
readily obtained in the carrying out of the details of the project. From
January 16 to May 5, 1947, Mr. Krieger visited and made test excava-
tions at Indian village sites referred to by Christopher Columbus in
the journal of his first voyage of discovery. Mr. Krieger also exam-
ined the probable site of the first Spanish settlement, that of the sailors
of the wrecked Santa Maria at La Navidad near the town of Cap
Haitien on the north coast of Haiti. He later revisited La Isabela,
the first planned Spanish colony in the Western Hemisphere. The
ruins of the stone buildings of the town are still visible although
most of the stone walls of the large warehouse, church, fort, and other
buildings have been removed to the city of Puerto Plata, where they
have been used in the construction of modern buildings.

During the first 2 weeks of August 1946 Mr. Krieger attended, as a
delegate of the Smithsonian Institution, the First International Con-
ference of Archeologists of the Caribbean, which was convened under
the auspices of the Government of the Republic of Honduras. The
plenary sessions of the conference were held at the capital city of
Tegucigalpa, but as the work progressed meetings were held most
pleasantly under towering trees at the ruins of the eighth-century
Maya city of Copan, on the stone seats of the south section of the
Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway. Ample facilities were provided
by the Honduras Government for the attending delegates, 60 in num-
ber, representing 14 American Republics and 36 educational and scien-
tific institutions. Visits were made by airplane to widely separated
sites where the prolific remains of Maya and other aboriginal cultures
are still visible in the form of pyramids, mounds, and ruins of aban-
doned Indian villages in the upland valleys of western Honduras.

The late Dr. Ale’ Hrdlicka, formerly curator of physical anthro-
pology, had planned to visit Guatemala in December of 1943 to take
measurements and observations on the Highland Maya, but he died
in September of that year. Dr. T. Dale Stewart finally undertook
this work during the first 3 months of 1947 under a grant from the
Department of State and in cooperation with scientists from Guate-
mala and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. In addition to
studying the living, Dr. Stewart examined also the available prehis-
toric skeletal remains, especially those recovered from the archeo-
logical sites known as San Agustin Acasaguastlan, Kaminaljuyi, and
Zaculeu.

The main objective of Dr. Stewart’s trip was to obtain information
about the living Highland Maya which would enable him to make
comparisons with the Lowland Maya of Yucatin. These two groups,
although rather widely separated geographically and exhibiting dif-
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

ferences in material culture, nevertheless belong to the same linguistic
stock. This linguistic stock, moreover, is remarkably homogeneous.
Since language is fairly resistant to change (more so than material
culture), considerable interest attaches to the question whether this
linguistic homogeneity reflects a similar status in physical type.

Dr. Stewart undertook the collection of data that would supplement
those already available and at the same time allow their fuller inter-
pretation. Since in Guatemala the municipio, being endogamous, is
the basic unit for ethnic study, he restricted his study to two municipios
within the Cakchiquel linguistic subgroup. First at Solola in the De-
partment of Solola, then later at Patztin in the Department of Chimal-
tenango, he secured comparable series of males—82 to 72, respec-
tively—and at Patztin, a series of 35 females. Altogether this is the
largest series from one highland linguistic group thus far studied.
In addition to the routine anthropometric measurements, observa-
tions, and photographs, the records obtained this season include blood
group (A, B; M, N), taste sensitivity to phenyl thiocarbamide, palm
and finger prints, and hair samples. In view of the success of this
first season, it is hoped that the experience thus gained can be utilized
for the extension of these observations elsewhere. It is important, for
example, to learn also to what extent in the highlands the barrier of
language is an aid in the formation of physical types. Furthermore,
if the records are made by one observer, they will be more uniform and
less subject to multiple personal biases.

Upon his return from Guatemala Dr. Stewart was detailed to stop
over in Mexico City in order to examine the recently recovered skeleton
of Tepexpan man. This important skeleton, found in what is consid-
ered by paleontologists as a Pleistocene stratum, may represent one of
the most complete skeletons dating from this early period in North
America. Subsequent to his visit the entire skeleton has been brought
to the United States National Museum by Sefior Javier Romero, who
is to work with Dr. Stewart in the restoration and reconstruction of the
skeletal parts. At the close of the fiscal year some progress has been
made in the restoration of the facial bones.

Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, associate curator of archeology, was on detail
to the River Basin Surveys and in charge of the Missouri River Basin
Survey from July 8 to October 18, 1946. He left Washington May 20,
1947, to resume this work. Joseph R. Caldwell, scientific aid, like-
wise was detailed to the River Basin Surveys from November 12, 1946,
to April 1,1947. (See appendix 5 for details.)

Members of the staff of the department of biology participated in
several important expeditions and a number of smaller field trips, all
of which returned valuable material to the collections. From other
expeditions in which the Museum personnel did not take part but
which were financed by the Smithsonian Institution or private con-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

tributors, many additional specimens were received. Foremost among
the expeditions was Operation Crossroads under the auspices of the
United States Navy to the northern Marshall Islands and Bikini.
Taking part in the biological investigations of this operation and rep-
resenting the Smithsonian Institution were Drs. Leonard P. Schultz
and J. P. E. Morrison, curator of fishes and associate curator of mol-
lusks, respectively, and Capt. Earl 8. Herald, whose detail the Navy
requested from the Army to relieve Dr. Schultz. Dr. Schultz re-
turned to Washington by plane on July 22, having left Washington on
the preceding February 13. Captain Herald returned to Washington
in mid-September. As ichthyologists, Dr. Schultz and Captain Herald
were especially concerned with the relative abundance of fishes on the
reefs and in the tidal zone before and after dropping the experimental
atomic bombs. In connection with the investigation they preserved
over 38,000 specimens for study and for the national collections. Dr.
Morrison, who left Washington on February 20 and returned August
25, gave his attention to both the vertebrate and invertebrate animal
life of the area, excepting the fish. He obtained specimens and data
concerning the arboreal, terrestrial, and intertidal animal communi-
ties and populations. Particularly complete was the series of birds
frequenting Bikini and the collections of mollusks of this and other of
the Marshall Islands group. On June 28, 1947, 2 days before the close
of the fiscal year, Drs. Schultz and Morrison accompanied by Frederick
M. Bayer, assistant curator of marine invertebrates, started on a re-
turn trip to Bikini for a resurvey of the faunal elements of the area
with which they were particularly concerned.

In continuation of the survey of the fishery resources of Guatemala
begun last year under the joint auspices of the Guatemalan Govern-
ment, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Smith-
sonian Institution, Dr. Robert R. Miller, associate curator of fishes,
spent some 10 weeks, March 7 to May 17, in Guatemala. Extensive
series of fish and associated animal life were obtained, the fish collected
to form the basis of an account of the fishes of that country.

On March 15, 1947, C. V. Morton, associate curator of plants, left
for a 12-week trip to St. Vincent, British West Indies, on a botanical
survey of that island with funds generously provided by Ernest May,
of Wilmington, Del. Although St. Vincent has an interesting flora,
it has been relatively neglected by collectors. Owing to the moun-
tainous terrain, there is still a great deal of untouched forested land
which provided ideal conditions for plant collecting. Mr. Morton
obtained 4,800 specimens on which he plans to base a checklist of the
flowering plants and ferns of the island.

The W. L. Abbott fund financed three different field parties during
the past year: M. A. Carriker, Jr., continuing field work in Colombia,
working for half the year in areas complementary to those already
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

covered previously, obtaining 1,758 bird skins; Salim Ali of Bombay
collecting birds in Gujerat and other areas in India, supplementing
the work of the Smithsonian-Yale University Expedition to India
and obtaining 556 birds; and Dr. A. Wetmore and W. M. Perrygo
making a rather short trip to the interior of Darién, Panama, and
returning with 453 bird skins, beautifully supplementing collections
made last year by the same collectors in adjacent areas.

The Smithsonian Institution-Yale University Expedition to India
under the direction of S. Dillon Ripley, assisted by E. C. Migdal!ski,
spent 6 months in various parts of India and in Nepal and made a
collection of approximately 1,500 birds, which added very signifi-
cantly to the Museum’s resources in the Asiatic field and will be of
great scientific value as much of it comes from old classical type locali-
ties.

Foster D. Smith, of the Socony Oil Co., Caracas, Venezuela, returned
to Venezuela early in the fiscal year and will again collect birds for
the Museum as time and opportunity allow; no reports regarding his
present efforts have yet been received.

Locally, in connection with a biological survey of the Patuxent Re-
search Refuge maintained by the Fish and Wildlife Service, Emery
C. Leonard, associate curator of plants, carried on field work on the
lower cryptogams, spending 6 days on the project and collecting about
800 specimens. This work will be continued during the coming year,
the collections to serve as a basis for a report on the cryptogamic flora
of the refuge. During August 1946, Drs. Remington Kellogg and
David H. Johnson, the curator and the associate curator, division of
mammals, collected fossil cetacean material from the Miocene beds at
Scientists’ Cliffs, Calvert County, Md. Paul S. Conger, associate cura-
tor, section of diatoms, spent 2 months at the Chesapeake Biological
Laboratory, Solomons, Md., continuing a survey of the Chesapeake Bay
diatoms, certain experiments on the growth of single diatoms under
natural conditions, and a study of diatoms as oyster food. In order
to secure material for the rearing of Hemiptera for the purpose of trac-
ing the development of structures useful in taxonomy and in the deter-
mination of phylogenetic relationships, W. E. Hoffmann, associate cur-
ator, division of insects, carried on considerable field work in and Pat
the city of Washington. i

The first field expedition of the year in the division of invertebrate
paleontology and paleobotany was carried on by Curator G. A. Cooper,
during the three summer months, in company with Dr. P. KE. Cloud,
Jr., of Harvard University. Several days at Batesville, Ark., yielded
excellent Silurian and Mississippian fossils. After a short time at
Muskogee, Okla., collecting Mississippian fossils, the party journeyed
to Marathon, Tex., where some 10 days were spent in getting out blocks
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

for etching of Permian limestone from the Glass Mountains. Next, at
Alamagordo and Silver City, N. Mex., Devonian fossils were obtained,
and from here the party proceeded to Eureka, Nev., to join Dr. T. B.
Nolan, of the United States Geological Survey, in mapping the Good-
win formation in Goodwin Canyon. The Devonian and Lower Ordo-
vician beds of some of the ranges west of Eureka were visited and the
field work ended at Salt Lake City.

Upon Dr. Cooper’s return, Dr. A. R. Loeblich, Jr., was engaged for
6 weeks in collecting Ordovician fossils in southern Virginia and
eastern Tennessee, in the region west of Nashville, and the Silurian
and Devonian in the classic areas of the valleys of the Tennessee River
in west Tennessee. On a short detail in August 1946 he spent several
days conferring with Dr. William H. Shideler at Miami University,
Oxford, Ohio, and a like period collecting Middle Ordovician and
Lower Devonian fossils in the Arbuckle Mountains, Okla. In late
April 1947, at the invitation of the Oklahoma Geological Survey, he
was occupied for 2 weeks in that State on stratigraphic work examin-
ing and collecting from the Silurian and Lower Devonian of the
Arbuckle Mountains.

In addition to the above field investigations, four short trips were
made by Drs. Cooper and Loeblich into the nearby Appalachians,
which resulted in good collections and blocks containing silicified
fossils for etching. The localities visited included the fine Middle
Ordovician exposures about 5 miles north of Harrisonburg, Va., the
Lower Devonian exposures on United States Highway No. 40 about
214 miles west of Indian Springs, Md., the Middle Ordovician at
Strasburg, Va., and the Silurian and Devonian at Keyser, W. Va., and
Cumberland, Md.

The 1946 summer field expedition in vertebrate paleontology, start-
ing in late May, continued well into the present year. The party,
composed of Curator C, Lewis Gazin and F. L. Pearce, first reexam-
ined the Paleocene and Cretaceous beds of central Utah and then de-
voted the greater part of the field season to prospecting and collecting
fossil mamma] remains from the Middle Eocene beds in the Bridger
Basin of southwestern Wyoming. Collecting from the Bridger for-
mation is part of a research program on the Middle Eocene faunas
begun prior to the war. Asa result of these expeditions, the National
Museum is building up one of the best research collections of Middle
Eocene mammals in the country and has succeeded in obtaining some
striking exhibition material representing this very primitive stage of
mammalian evolution. The party was successful in getting much
good material of the smaller, less-well-known insectivores, primates,
rodents, carnivores, and artiodactyls, as well as good skulls of such
animals as Hyrachyus, Palaeosyops, and Uintatheriwm.
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

The last 2 weeks of the season were spent in going over Lower
Eocene beds in the Wind River Basin of central Wyoming and in
examining and making a collection from an isolated occurreuce of
Duchesne River, Upper Eocene, beds in the northern part of the
Wind River Basin.

Associate Curator D. H. Dunkle, accompanied by F. L. Pearce, left
for field work near Lamy, N. Mex., prior to the close of this fiscal year.
There, assisted by G. F. Sternberg, they began quarry operations at a
Triassic locality for an exhibition slab of ancient amphibian skulls
and other skeletal parts belonging to the genus Buettneria, This has
now been quarried out and is ready for shipment to the Museum. If
the season permits, they expect to examine other localities and forma-
tions of still greater age for fossil fish and primitive tetrapods in the
general region of east-central New Mexico, with the hope of building
up a more representative collection of these forms for our study
collection.

The 5-month sojourn in Japan of Curator W. F. Foshag and
Associate Curator E. P. Henderson may well be considered a field
trip, since, whenever time permitted, studies were made on mineral-
ogical subjects, local universities were visited, and arrangements for
exchange of material were concluded.

PUBLICATIONS

Fourteen publications were issued during the year: One Annual
Report, three Bulletins, two Contributions from the National Her-
barium, and eight Proceedings papers. A list of these is given in the
complete report on Smithsonian publications, appendix 12.

The distribution of volumes and separates to libraries and other —
institutions and to individuals aggregated 34,952 copies.

MEETINGS AND SPECIAL EXHIBITS

The Smithsonian continued to make available the auditorium and
lecture room of the Natural History Building to educational, scien-
tific, welfare, and governmental organizations and groups for meet-
ings and lectures. During the year 275 groups availed themselves
of this opportunity. The foyer and adjacent space in the Natural
History Building were in constant use during the year for a series of
15 special exhibits sponsored by various groups, including the Smith-
sonian Centennial exhibit, which ran from August 10 to September
27, 1946. In addition, 23 special exhibits were held by the division
of graphic arts—12 of etchings, lithographs, and other prints by
various artists, and 11 of photographs.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23
CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION

Through a reorganization in the department of engineering and
industries, a new unit under the division of crafts and industries—
the section of manufactures—was established effective September 16,
i946. The section of aeronautics was changed to a division on Jan-
vary 6, 1947, and at the same time the division of medicine and public
health was made an independent division reporting to the head
curator of the department.

REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sim: I have the honor to submit, on behalf of the Board of Trustees
of the National Gallery of Art, the tenth annual report of the Board,
covering its operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947. This
report is made pursuant to the provisions of section 5 (d) of Public
Resolution No. 14, Seventy-fifth Congress, first session, approved
March 24, 1937 (50 Stat. 51).

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947, the Board consisted of
the Chief Justice of the United States, the Secretary of State, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
ex officio, and five general trustees, Samuel H. Kress, Ferdinand Lam-
mot Belin, Duncan Phillips, Chester Dale, and Paul Mellon.

At its annual meeting held on May 6, 1947, the Board reelected Sam-
uel H. Kress as President, and Ferdinand Lammot Belin as Vice
President, to serve for the ensuing year. The executive officers con-
tinuing in office during the year were:

Huntington Cairns, Secretary-Treasurer.

David E. Finley, Director.

Harry A. McBride, Administrator.

Huntington Cairns, General Counsel.

John Walker, Chief Curator.

Macgill James, Assistant Director.
Donald D. Shepard continued to serve during the year as Adviser to
the Board.

On July 1, 1946, Lamont Moore was appointed Curator in charge of
education and resumed his duties in the Gallery after an absence of 3
years. During that time he served in the Army of the United States
in the European Theater and as Assistant Secretary to the American
Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic
Monuments in War Areas.

The three standing committees of the Board, provided for in the
bylaws, as constituted at the annual meeting of the Board, held May 6,
1947, were:

The permanent Government positions on the Gallery staff are filled
from registers of the United States Civil Service Commission, or with
its approval. On June 30, 1947, the permanent Government staff of
the Gallery numbered 305 employees, as compared with 298 employees
on June 30, 1946.

Throughout the year a high standard of operation and maintenance
of the Gallery building and grounds, and protection of the Gallery’s
collections of works of art, has been sustained.

APPROPRIATIONS

For salaries and expenses for the upkeep and operation of the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, the protection and care of works of art acquired
by the Board of Trustees, and all administrative expenses incident
thereto pursuant to the provisions of section 4 (a) of Public Resolution
No. 14, Seventy-fifth Congress, first session, approved March 24, 1937
(50 Stat. 51), the Congress appropriated for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1947, the sum of $883,920. This amount included the regular
appropriation of $772,490, a supplemental appropriation of $101,000
primarily to meet the Gallery’s obligations under the Federal Em-
ployees Pay Act of 1946, and an additional appropriation of $10,430
to make up other deficiencies in the 1947 appropriation caused mainly
by the higher salaries paid returning veterans over war service in-
cumbents, in-grade promotions, and reallocations of positions by the
Civil Service Commission in 1946 and 1947.

From these appropriations the following expenditures and encum-
brances were incurred:

26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

In addition to the above-mentioned appropriations, the Gallery re-
ceived the sum of $21,600 from the Department of State to cover ex-
penses during the fiscal year of the Inter-American Office of the
Gallery, for the promotion of art activities between the United Sates
and the Latin-American Republics.

ATTENDANCE

During the fiscal year 1947, there were 1,448,038 visitors to the Gal-
Jery building, an average daily attendance of 3,989. This attendance
figure shows a decline as compared with last year, when the total
number of visitors was 1,947,668. ‘The decrease is undoubtedly due to
the fact that during the first 6 months of the fiscal year there were
fewer men and women from the armed services in the city and normal
tourist traffic had not yet been resumed. Attendance during the last
3 months of the year has risen nearly to the 1946 level, visits of groups
of school children being unusually numerous.

The Sunday evening openings, featuring concerts in the Gallery’s
Kast Garden Court without admission charge, have continued to be
exceedingly popular throughout the year.

CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE BUILDING

It was necessary during the year to overhaul completely two of the
large refrigeration machines, and this was successfully accomplished
by the Gallery staff.

Considerable improvement has been made in the care of the grounds,
including the extension of the irrigation system, and the Gallery staff
is now growing a large portion of the smaller plants used for the
decoration of the two garden courts.

The staff also produced all the special exhibition cases and several
pedestals for the exhibition of Indigenous Art of the Americas (Bliss
Collection), as well as the special lighting effects required for this
exhibition.

INSTALLATION OF ADDITIONAL AIR-CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT

As stated in the annual report for the fiscal year 1946, the gradual
opening of additional spaces in the Gallery building and the con-
struction of six new galleries made it necessary to augment the air-
conditioning equipment. This was made possible by funds donated
for the purpose, and the installation of a fourth refrigeration machine
is now in the final stage of completion. It was anticipated that this
contract would be completed during the fiscal year 1946, but owing
to various difficulties the date of completion was necessarily delayed.
It is now expected that the installation should be completed and all
equipment ready for operation by November 1947.

PUBLICATIONS

The publishing program of the National Gallery of Art, under the
direction of the Custodians of the Publications Fund, has continued
its expansion. During the fiscal year the third edition of Master-
pieces of Painting from the National Gallery of Art, by Huntington
Cairns and John Walker, was published. Arrangements also were
made for the publication of an English edition. The Gallery has
initiated a series of National Gallery of Art handbooks, two of which
were issued during the year. These are: How to Look at Works of
Art: The Search for Line, by Lois A. Bingham, and Chinese Porce-
lains of the Widener Collection, by Erwin O. Christensen. Also issued
during the year was a small volume of color reproductions, entitled
“Favorite Paintings from the National Gallery of Art,” with accom-
panying texts prepared by the Curatorial and Educational
Departments.

Various articles by members of the Gallery staff were published dur-
ing the year. An article on Hobbes’ Theory of Law, by Huntington
Cairns, appeared in the 1946 issue of Seminar, and one on Leibniz’s
Theory of Law in the Harvard Law Review for December 1946. A
lecture by Mr. Cairns, delivered at Harvard University on May 3, 1947,
as part of a 3-day Symposium on Music Criticism, and entitled “The
Future of Musical Patronage in America,” will be published by Har-
vard University Press in book form. Mr. Cairns also contributed an
article, “Philosophy as Jurisprudence,” to Essays in Honor of Roscoe
Pound, published by Oxford University Press. A comprehensive
article on the National Gallery, its collections, installations, and his-
tory, prepared by J. B. Eggen, was issued at the close of 1946 as volume
57-58 of the International Museum Journal, Mouseion, Paris, France.

An article on American Painters and British Critics, by John
Walker, was published in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, and a series of
12 brief articles on American paintings in the Tate Exhibition, also by
Mr. Walker, appeared in The Ladies’ Home Journal. Charles Sey-
mour, Jr., published an article on Thirteenth-Century Art, and another
in collaboration with Hanns Swarzenski on A Madonna of Humility
and Quercia’s Early Style, both appearing in the Gazette des Beaux-
Arts. James W. Lane contributed to Art in America, The College
Art Journal, The Catholic World, and other publications. Members
of the curatorial staff under Mr. Seymour’s direction also edited the
handbook of the Bliss Collection of Pre-Columbian Art, entitled “In-
digenous Art of the Americas,” the text for which was supplied by
Samuel Lothrop.

Books by members of the staff in preparation or in press at the end of
the fiscal year included The Limits of Art, by Mr. Cairns, an extensive
compilation of selections of poetry and prose that have been held to be
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

the greatest of their kind in critical literature from Aristotle to recent
times. A fully illustrated volume on the Gallery’s sculpture, designed
as a companion volume to Masterpieces of Painting, by Messrs. Cairns
and Walker, is being prepared by Mr. Seymour for publication next
year under the title “Sculpture in the National Gallery of Art.” A
book by Elizabeth Mongan on the Gallery’s print collection will appear
in 1949. A thesis on Jan Mandijn, by Charles M. Richards, will also
be published. A work entitled “Three Centuries of American Paint-
ing” has been prepared by James W. Lane. A comprehensive work on
the Index of American Design, tentatively entitled “Made in America,”
is being compiled by Mr. Christensen for publication in the near future.
Another book by Mr. Christensen scheduled to appear jointly in the
United States and England is entitled “Popular Art in the United
States.” A picture book on the paintings and sculpture in the Widener
Collection is now on the press, and five handbooks on the Widener
Collection of Decorative Arts have been prepared by Mr. Christensen.

Work on the revision and amplification of the Gallery’s original
preliminary catalog, published in 1941, has continued. For the re-
vised catalog of paintings, notes have been prepared on more than
three-fourths of the new paintings not previously cataloged. The
sculpture catalog, being prepared by Mr. Seymour, is also moving
rapidly to completion.

Other forthcoming publications by,members of the Gallery staff
include an article by Huntington Cairns on Robert Briffault and the
Rehabilitation of the Matriarchal Theory for An Introduction to
the History of Sociology, to be published by the University of Chicago
Press, and also an article on The Future of Musical Patronage, to
appear in the Atlantic Monthly. A second series of short articles
by Mr. Walker, on paintings in the Chester Dale Collection, will ap-
pear in The Ladies’ Home Journal. An article on Houdon by Mr.
Seymour is scheduled for publication in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts,
and an article on American Folk Art as Revealed in the Index of
American Design, by Mr. Christensen, will be published in Art in
America.

Miss Mongan has been made an editor of the Graphic Art section
of a new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Mr. Christensen
has reassembled and organized unbound copies of the Widener tapestry
catalog into portfolios for sale in the Information Rooms and distri-
bution to colleges.

of fine quality but moderately priced, and it is rather interesting to
note that in one item—postcards of works of art—nearly 3,000,000
copies have been sold since the Gallery was opened in 1941.

In connection with the Centennial celebration of the Smithsonian
Institution a special exhibition showing representative examples of
Chinese art from the Neolithic age to the eighteenth century was
assembled in Gallery XIII from the material in the collections. A
special Gallery Book accompanied this exhibition.

In connection with the Symposium on Byzantine Studies held at the
Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection a special exhibition
of late classical and early Christian art was assembled in Gallery VI
from materials in the collections.

STUDY COLLECTIONS

A notable addition to the study collections of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution was the material given by Dr. Ernst Herzfeld, of Princeton,
N. J. This gift, known as the Herzfeld Archive, was made to the
Smithsonian Institution with proviso that it be deposited in, and held
under the direction of, the Freer Gallery of Art, but not to be consid-
ered a part of the Freer Collection. Dr. Herzfeld’s letter of trans-
mittal to Dr. Wetmore was dated April 24, 1946, and the material
reached the Gallery on June 6; but the time required to unpack the
cases and make a preliminary check of the contents prevented its inclu-
sion in the annual report dated July 1, 1946.

The material was collected by Dr. Herzfeld between the years
1903 and 1936 in the course of archeological expeditions to the Near
East which included excavations at Samarra, Sistan, Pasargadae, and
Persepolis. While a detailed catalog has yet to be completed, the
following brief list suggests the scope and nature of the Archive:

1. 80 wooden boxes containing 50 negatives each. Catalog of the nega-
tives. 16 files of blueprints.

2. Several hundred large drawings, water colors, plans and maps of Oriental
buildings, sculpture, objects of art, ete. A number of squeezes of
inscriptions.

8. 45 sketchbooks of original surveys made in the field. A number of box

files with notes, texts of inscriptions, inventories, dummies for publica-
tions, etc.
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

4. 95 objects including pottery and metalwork of no special material value,
but of some scientific interest.

It is the donor’s wish that these materials be used for study and
publication by members of the Institution staff and other qualified
scholars, and that the objects be available for exhibition in the Institu-
tion at the discretion of the Director of the Freer Gallery of Art.

ATTENDANCE

The Gallery was open to the public from 9 to 4:30 every day
except Christmas Day. The total number of visitors to come in
the main entrance was 107,237. The weekday total was 80,031, and
the Sunday total was 27,206. The average weekday attendance was
256, the average Sunday attendance, 523. The highest monthly at-
tendance was in April with 15,794 visitors; the lowest, in February

REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947, conducted
in accordance with the Act of Congress of June 27, 1944, which
provides “* * * for continuing ethnological researches among
the American Indians and the natives of Hawaii and the excavation
and preservation of archeologic remains. * * *”

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

Dr. M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau, spent the greater part
of the fiscal year in Washington, attending to administrative duties
and completing for publication reports on archeological field work
in southern Mexico. Two papers were completed entitled “An
Archeological Reconnaissance of the State of Tabasco, Mexico,” and
“Piedra Parada, a Chiapas Highland Site.” Considerable progress
was also made on a paper entitled “Additional Stone Monuments
of Southern Mexico.”

Several lectures were given during the year on anthropological
subjects. In April 1947 Dr. Stirling went to Houston, Tex., as
representative of the Smithsonian Institution at the Inauguration of
Dr. Wm. Vermillon Houston as President of Rice Institute.

Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Associate Chief of the Bureau and
Director of the River Basin Surveys, devoted the major part of his
time during the fiscal year to directing the program of the River
Basin Surveys. The latter is a cooperative project between the
Smithsonian Institution, the National Park Service, the Bureau of
Reclamation, and the Corps of Engineers, United States Army. Its
purpose is the recovery of such archeological and paleontological
information and materials as will be lost through the construction
of dams and the creation of large reservoirs in many of the river
valleys of the United States.

In directing the survey work Dr. Roberts recruited personnel,
arranged for supplies and equipment, established cooperation with
local institutions in various parts of the country, prepared over-all
plans for a Nation-wide archeological program, wrote progress re-
ports for the cooperating agencies, and aided in the preparation of
preliminary reports on the results of surveys in various reservoir

areas. He went to Atlanta, Ga., July 23-25, 1946, to confer with
representatives of the National Park Service and engineers in the
office of the Division Engineer for the South Atlantic Division, Corps
of Engineers, about the problems in that area. He went to Lincoln,
Nebr., September 24 to October 4, to meet the incoming field parties
from the Missouri Basin. At that time he received reports on the
explorations, discussed plans for future investigations, and assisted
in making arrangements for carrying on the work at the field head-
quarters during the fall and winter months. While at Lincoln he
made two trips to Omaha to confer with officials of the National
Park Service, Region 2, and engineers from the office of the Division
Engineer, Missouri River Division, Corps of Engineers. From De-
cember 26 to 31, he was in Chicago, Il., to take part in a symposium
on river valley archeology in which there were representatives from
the National Park Service, the American Anthropological Associa-
tion, the Society for American Archeology, the Committee for the
Recovery of Archeological Remains, and several universities. Dr.
Roberts’ report on the activities of the River Basin Surveys appears
in subsequent pages.

During the course of the year Dr. Roberts wrote several book
reviews for anthropological journals, annotated four books for the
United States Quarterly Book List, prepared a number of popular
articles on the work of the River Basin Surveys, and served as a con-
sultant on manuscripts on anthropology and archeology for several
encyclopedias.

Dr. Roberts was the General Department Representative on the
Efficiency Rating Board of Review for the Smithsonian Institution.
In this connection he attended the Civil Service Commission Institute
of Efficiency Rating Boards of Review. He represented the Smith-
sonian Institution at a meeting held in Washington, D. C., April 15,
1947, for the purpose of organizing a National Council for Historic
Sites and Buildings.

From July 1, 1946, to June 30, 1947, Dr. Roberts served as a member
of the executive committee of the Division of Anthropology and
Psychology, National Research Council.

During the absences of the Chief, Dr. Roberts was Acting Chief of
the Bureau.

The beginning of the fiscal year found Dr. John P. Harrington,
ethnologist, at Searchlight, Nev., from which point he traveled with
Murl Emery to a point above Cottonwood Island in one of the wildest
portions of the Colorado River where, according to Indian tradition, is
the house of Matavilya, principal deity of the lower Colorado region.
The house of Matavilya was discovered to be a natural formation con-
sisting of a butte about 200 feet high on the western side of the river,
and opposite this butte another, perhaps 500 feet in height, on the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY a)

eastern side of the river. These two buttes are interpreted by the
ancient Indians of the region as being what remains of the doorposts
of the house of Matavilya, and Indian tradition has evidently attached
itself to this place for many generations, probably for many centuries.

The interesting myth was obtained which recounts the destruction
of the house at the time of the cremation of Matavilya. Consider-
able time was spent in checking with surviving ancient Indians in
regard to the discovery of this important site, Dr. Harrington going as
far as Tehachapi, Calif., for this purpose.

On November 6, 1946, Dr. Harrington returned to Washington,
D. C., and the entire remainder of the fiscal year was spent in sorting
over and preparing various articles for publication.

The first of these undertakings was the preparation of an article on
the State Names of Mexico. This paper covers not only the state
and territory names of Mexico, but also the country names of Central
America and South America. Several of the etymologies are new,
notably that of the name of the Mexican State of Yucatan, which
is here seen to be derived perhaps from a hypothetical form Yucahtan.

The next item completed was an article on the Tewa language of
New Mexico. A paper on the Province Names of Canada was next
finished. Compilation for this work had long been in progress, part
of it done in Canada.

An extensive paper on the Aleutian language was next written,
embodying the results of previous field work in Alaska. Another
paper was prepared consisting of a detailed ethnogeographic descrip-
tion of the projecting rocks and islands off the coast of California.

A manuscript was completed with the title “Quirix is the Native
Name of San Felipe Pueblo.” This paper sets forth the unique thesis
that Bandelier is wrong in assuming that Quirix, which gives its name
to the Keresan linguistic stock, 1s Bernalillo, or any site in the vicinity
of Bernalillo, but that the recorded form is a Spanish spelling of the
Indian name of San Felipe. The Tewa of the Castafieda account of
the Coronado Expedition would then be Isleta, and Isleta is still called
Tewa in Keresan.

A number of short papers were also written, the titles being as
follows:

The Name Yucatan.

The Name Colorado.

The Three Harliest Mentions of the Turquoise Mines of New Mexico.
The Name Chuckwalla.

Rita, a Short-Cut for Saying Riito.

De Alarcon has the Name of Zunyi Salt Lake.

Olivella River, the Old Name of Santa Fe Creek.

Trail Holder.
H’aak’o, Original Keresan Name of Acoma.

56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Dr. Henry B. Collins, ethnologist, continued his investigations in
Eskimo anthropology. During the winter he completed the number-
ing and cataloging of his collection of some 7,000 archeological speci-
mens excavated at Cape Prince of Wales and other prehistoric Eskimo
village sites around Bering Strait.

At the February meeting of the Board of Governors of the Arctic
Institute of North America, Dr. Collins was elected vice chairman of
the Institute. His article, The Origin and Antiquity of the Eskimo,
tracing the Old World afiiliations of the Eskimo culture and race type,
will appear as one of the chapters of a general book on the Arctic to be
published by the Arctic Institute.

In May Dr. Collins was appointed Chairman of the Directing Com-
mittee for the Arctic Bibliography and Roster, two separate projects
which the Arctic Institute of North America is carrying out under
contract for the Office of Naval Research of the Navy Department.
In these projects the Arctic Institute is receiving active cooperation
and assistance from the Library of Congress and the National Re-
search Council. Officials of the latter organizations, and representa-
tives of the Navy, Army, and Board of Governors of the Arctic Insti-
tute comprise the directing committee, which serves as a policy and
advisory body with the responsibility of organizing and supervising
the work on the two projects. The bibliography project will be con-
ducted by four experienced bibliographers, with clerical assistants,
working in the principal libraries in the United States and Canada.
It will have as its objective the compilation of an annotated, fully
indexed bibliography covering the descriptive, geographical, and
other scientific literature on the Arctic from the earliest historical
writings to those of the present time. It is estimated that the bibli-
ography project will require at least 3 years for completion. The
Roster of Arctic Specialists, a 2-year project, is to be conducted by a
staff of three workers, headed by a former official of the National
Roster of Scientific and Specialized Personnel. The roster will be
patterned after the National Roster and the World Roster of Area
and Language Specialists compiled by the Ethnogeographic Board
during the war. Its purpose will be to assemble a comprehensive
record of the experience and specialized knowledge of scientists, ex-
plorers, writers, and Arctic residents who possess first-hand informa-
tion of value concerning the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.

Dr. Collins wrote the article Anthropology for the 1947 Encycilo-
paedia Britannica Book of the Year. He also served as anthro-
pological consultant for the Encyclopedia Arctica, which is being edited
by Dr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson for the Navy Department. In this
capacity he organized the anthropological sections of the Encyclo-
pedia and contributed several articles on archeological subjects.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 7

In June Dr. Collins left Washington for Martha’s Vineyard, Mass.,
to conduct a 6 weeks’ archeological survey of the island.

Returning to a study of the social organization and ceremonial life
of the Seneca Nation commenced before the war, Dr. William N. Fen-
ton, ethnologist, established field quarters on the Allegany Reserva-
tion between July 1 and September 18, when he returned to Washing-
ton. Observations made 10 years ago were repeated at meetings of
two orders of the Medicine Society, and observing the Green Corn
Festival for the fifth time afforded information on social and cultural
change. At the behest of one of the chiefs, Dr. Fenton recorded from
Fannie Stevens, matron of the Heron clan, several hundred personal
names belonging to the eight Seneca clans. Recordings made in 1945
for a forthcoming album of Seneca music were played repeatedly to
the singers and interpreters to assure accuracy of texts. With a
possible documentary film in mind, 700 feet of 16-mm. Kodachrome
moving pictures were taken of various activities in the Coldspring
community. An additional week of field work from October 7 to 12
permitted verifying some of the personal names in genealogies taken
in 1933.

Cultural affinities between the northern Iroquoians and their
southern cousins, the Cherokee of the Great Smoky Mountains, have
occupied the attention of Bureau ethnologists since Mooney’s time.
At the invitation of Lester M. Hargrett, of Washington, the bibli-
ographer of Indian Laws, Dr. Fenton motored to Cherokee, N. C., in
early December. We owe a brief and intensive introduction to
Cherokee ethnology to Will West Long, who was 17 when James
Mooney came to Cherokee and whose name is associated with the work
of every field ethnologist who ventured into Big Cove settlement from
1887 until March 14, 1947, when Will passed away.

Dr. Fenton obtained information for contrasting the Boogah Dance
of the Cherokee with masked performances of the Iroquois False-face
Society, and some additional details were collected on the Eagle Dance,
a variant of the calumet ritual, which reached the Iroquois during the
eighteenth century by one documented line of diffusion from the
Catawba and Cherokee of the Southeast. When recordings of Cherokee
and Seneca Eagle Dance songs are compared, it will develop that
they are derived from a common source. Photographs were made of
the Cherokee mask-making process, and some portraits of Mr. Long in
characteristic Eagle Dance postures. A report of these findings has
been prepared for publication.

Two collections of Americana seen on this trip deserve mention. The
MacGregor Collection in the Library of the University of Virginia
contains some notable early items on American Indians. Dr. T. H.
Spence, Librarian of the Historical Foundation of the Presbyterian
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Reformed Church, Montreat, N. C., called attention to an extremely
rare pamplet which describes Chickasaw and Choctaw towns, locates
certain mounds, and contains notes on pigeon roosts (A Brief History
of the Mississippi Territory ; to Which is Prefixed a Summary View of
the Country between the Settlements on Cumberland River, and the
Territory, by Rev. James Hall, A. M., Salisbury (N. C.) : 12 mo., pp.
(2) 70, printed by Francis Coupée, 1801).

The second conference on Iroquois research, which Dr. Fenton
organized in 1945, was again the outstanding event in Iroquois studies.
The conference, held October 4, 5, and 6, in cooperation with the Al-
legany State Park Commission at Red House, N. Y., brought together
anthropologists and historians interested in the Iroquois from the
Northeastern States, Canada, and the Middle West. Charles E. Cong-
don of Salamanca, N. Y., and Merle H. Deardorff of Warren, Pa., were
cchosts to the conference.

Dr. Fenton gave several lectures during the year on topics related
to his work; on September 10 to the L. H. Morgan Chapter, New
York State Archaeological Association, Rochester; October 15 to the
Anthropological Society of Washington; December 12 to the Arts
Club of Washington.

A chapter was completed for a forthcoming report of the American
Folklore Society: “Research in American Folklore: Plains, Eastern
Woodlands, and Contact Folklore between Indians and Colonial
Settlers.” Seneca Songs from Coldspring Longhouse was prepared
as program notes to an album of records which the Library of Congress
is publishing. Work was continued on a final draft of a report for
the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, A Cayuga Condolence
Cane with Pictographs Denominating the Founders of the Iroquois
League, a study which Dr. Fenton commenced several years ago at
the request of the Cranbrook Institute of Science.

As a member of the Committee on International Cooperation in
Anthropology, National Research Council, Dr. Fenton attended two
meetings in Washington, and prepared a report on Anthropology
during the War, VII: The Arab World (American Anthropologist,
1947, pp. 342-3843). He relinquished secretaryship of the Anthropo-
logical Society of Washington, becoming vice president, and continued
to give considerable time to the Journal of the Washington Academy
of Sciences, as senior editor during 1947.

tions, Armed Services Educational Programs, American Council on
Education, xi+89 pp., Washington, 1947).

In addition, several reviews were prepared and published in the
United States Quarterly Book List, and in other journals.

Dr. Philip Drucker, anthropologist, returned to his official station
at Washington from Mexico at the beginning of the fiscal year. While
awaiting the arrival of the collections from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan,
he began a study of the La Venta ceramic collections, excavated by
the National Geographic Society-Smithsonian Institution expedition
in the spring of 1942.

During the ensuing months he classified some 24,000 sherds from
the site of La Venta, recording descriptive data and stratigraphic dis-
tributions which will be embodied in the final report on the culture
represented at this key site of Olmec culture. At the conclusion of
his study of these materials he prepared a brief paper entitled “Some
Implications of La Venta Ceramics,” for the Smithsonian Miscellane-
ous Collections.

On February 8, 1947, he proceeded from Washington to Mexico on a
joint expedition of the National Geographic Society and the Smith-
sonian Institution. The purpose of this expedition was to make an
archeological survey of the Pacific coast of the state of Chiapas,
Mexico, From the time of his arrival in Tapachula, Chiapas, on
February 16, until his departure from Tonala, Chiapas, on May 24,
he tested 15 archeological sites, obtaining from each collections of
sherds ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 pieces on the average. Among
these sites were several whose ceramics indicated a relationship with
the Mixteca-Puebla area of the Highland, and which are probably to
be attributed to the late pre-Conquest intrusions of the Nahuatl-speak-
ing Pipil, colonies of whom penetrated as far southeastward as Nica-
ragua. Other sites yielded wares that indicate affiliation with more
ancient horizons, one such linking very definitely with the oldest ce-
ramic complex yet known from Guatemala Highland and coast: the
Miraflores horizon. One of the outstanding finds of the survey was the
discovery of a midden deposit over 3 meters in depth, containing pot-
tery in the upper 1.2 m., and no trace of ceramics below this point. This
site requires more extensive excavation than was possible during the
survey, but it is quite possible that it may contain the earliest remains
yet known from southern Mexico and Central America—perhaps pre-
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

ceramic and early ceramic horizons whose existence up to now has
only been suspected but never demonstrated.

In the month of March, during the survey work, Dr. Drucker made
a brief visit to Guatemala City where, through the courtesy of Drs.
R. E. Smith and Edwin Shook of the Carnegie Institution, he was
permitted to study pottery collections from the Guatemala Highlands
and coast, in the Carnegie Institution Laboratory.

From Tonala, Dr. Drucker proceeded to Mexico City to arrange for
the exportation of the collections.

On June 9 Dr. Drucker arrived in Washington, D. C., where he
was detailed to the River Basin Surveys project, under the direction
of Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Associate Chief of the Bureau of
American Ethnology. Atter a series of conferences with Dr. Roberts,
Dr. Drucker proceeded on June 16 to the Pacific coast to take charge of
archeological work in areas to be inundated by Bureau of Reclamation
and Corps of Engineers dams in that area.

From July 1 through September 1 Dr. Gordon R. Willey, anthro-
pologist, continued his field investigations, begun in March of 1946,
as a member of the Virii Valley Expedition to northern Peru. The
Virti program was a cooperative attempt, on the part of a group of
anthropologists and a geographer, to study thoroughly a single valley
of the Peruvian coast as a living unit through some 3,000 years of time.
Archeological, geographical, and modern community studies were
embraced in the project, which was under the direction of a steering
committee of the Institute of Andean Research. As one of the major
participants, Dr. Willey represented the Bureau on the steering com-
mittee. His own share of the research consisted of a survey of the
prehistoric settlement patterns of the valley.

At the close of field operations in August over 800 sites had been
studied from the point of view of community plan or settlement
pattern. These sites were selected from all sections of the valley, and
it is estimated that they represent a 25-percent sample of the total
sites in the valley. All types of sites were included in the sample—
cemeteries, dwelling units, fortifications, temples, and palaces. In
addition particular attention was paid to prehistoric irrigation canals,
evidences of past land utilization, and ancient roads. Preliminary
analysis shows eight cultural periods to be represented. The survey
was accomplished with the aid of jeep transportation and large-scale
air photo-maps. <A technique of site mapping, involving the use of
an epidiascopic projector, was worked out with the air photos. The
final report on this survey is now in preparation.

In addition to the settlement survey Willey also excavated at two
burial sites, one in the upper and one in the lower valley. A report
on the first of these sites has recently been published.

Karly in August Willey took part in the Conference on Peruvian
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

Archeology held at Hacienda Chiclin. At this time he presented a
preliminary summary of his field results.

After the work in Virii was terminated, Dr. Willey made a brief
visit to the Lambayeque Valley, north of the city of Trujillo, and
examined collections in the important but little-known Bruning
Museum. Returning south to Lima, he began a protracted trip by
automobile, going from Lima to Caamana and from there inland to the
Lake Titicaca region. From Puno, on the lake, he proceeded north to
Cuzco, Ayacucho, Huancayo, and returned to Lima. During this
trip, which consumed some 2 to 3 weeks during the month of Septem-
ber, he visited numerous archeological sites. The most significant of
these was the great architectural cluster at Huari near Ayacucho, the
presumed center for the Middle Period Tiahuanacoid diffusion
throughout Peru.

Upon his return to the United States in October Dr. Willey pre-
pared several short papers and began the initial work of organizing
notes, maps, and photographs on the Virti settlement-pattern study.
He was engaged in this until April of 1947. For the last 3 months of
the fiscal year he transferred his research interests toward the com-
pletion of a large monograph on the archeology of the Florida Gulf
coast. This latter work, which embraces earlier field work of the
author, as well as past field studies made by the Bureau in the Florida
Gulf area, is intended as an over-all archeological summary of the
region.

During the year Dr. Willey also served as assistant editor to the
professional journal, American Antiquity, and submitted various news
items on recent researches in archeology in South America. He held
a similar position with the Handbook of Latin American Studies for
which he prepared bibliographic extracts on some 50 titles dealing
with South American archeology and wrote a general summary of
recent archeological activities for the South American Continent dur-
ing the year 1945,

In April Dr. Willey visited the Public Museum at Rochester, N. Y.,
where he delivered a lecture on the Virti work before the annual meet-
ing of the New York State Archeological Society.

The following articles were written by Dr. Willey during the fiscal
year 1946-47:

1. The Virti Valley Program in Northern Peru. Acta Americana, vol. 4, No. 4,
1946.

2. A Middle Period Cemetery in the Virtii Valley, Northern Peru. Journ. Wash-
ington Acad. Sci., vol. 37, No. 2, 1947.

3. Ecuadorean Figurines and the Ceramic Mold in the New World. (In press.)
4. Growth Trends in New World Cultures. (In press.)
5. An Interpretative Analysis of Horizon Styles in Peruvian Archeology. (In

press. )

In addition, one book review was prepared for Science.

INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY

The Institute of Social Anthropology was created in 1943 as an
autonomous unit of the Bureau of American Ethnology to carry out
cooperative training in anthropological teaching and research with
the other American Republics. During the past year it was financed
by transfers from the State Department, totaling $118,150, from the
appropriation “Cooperation with the American Republics, 1947.” The
major activities of the Institute of Social Anthropology during the
fiscal year 1947 are as follows:

Washington office—The Institute of Social Anthropology main-
tains headquarters in Washington for general planning, direction, and
servicing of field projects. Dr. Julian H. Steward, founder and first
Director of the Institute, resigned in September 1946 to accept a pro-
fessorship at Columbia University. He was succeeded by Dr. George
M. Foster, previously stationed in Mexico as social anthropologist of
the Institute of Social Anthropology.

Brazil_—Cooperation with the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Politica
began October 1, 1945, when Dr. Donald Pierson was assigned as rep-
resentative of the Institute of Social Anthropology to Brazil. In
February 1946 Dr. Kalervo Oberg was assigned as cultural] anthropolo-
gist to cooperate with the Escola Livre.

In effect, the Institute has taken over and expanded a program which
was begun under Dr. Pierson in 1940 and which has helped make the
Escola Livre one of the most important social-science centers in South
America.

During the fiscal year 1947 Institute of Social Anthropology scien-
tists have given seven courses in sociology and anthropology, to sup-
plement other courses given by local professors in the general field
of the humanities. Advanced students have been given field training
both in Mato Grosso among Indian groups, and among the rural
peoples in the State of Sao Paulo, some distance from the city. This
represents a very considerable educational advance, since for the first
time advanced Brazilian students in anthropology and sociology, as
a part of their regular courses, have been required to supplement
theoretical classroom training with actual field experience. A number
of papers by Smithsonian personnel and local students have been
published in scientific series or journals other than Smithsonian vol-
umes. Two monographs based on field work in 1947 are being pre-
pared for publication by Smithsonian personnel in Smithsonian series,
and Brazilian students also are preparing field notes for publication
in Portuguese.

Smithsonian staff members have continued to guide the program of
translating 200 articles and 13 books from English into Portuguese,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

mentioned in last year’s report. This work, financed by outside funds,
is of great importance as an aid to teaching.

Colombia.—Cooperation with the Instituto Etnolégico of the Uni-
versity of Cauca in Popayaén began December 1,1946. The Institute of
Social Anthropology is represented by Dr. John H. Rowe who is en-
gaged in cooperating with local personnel in the organization of this
new institution and in giving three courses in anthropology to stu-
dents. A short survey of the habitat of the Guambiano Indians has
indicated that this is a satisfactory region for field work, which begins
on a cooperative basis during the summer of 1947, with the participa-
tion of Colombian professors and students.

Mexico.—Cooperation with the Escuela Nacional de Antropologfa,
a dependency of the Ministry of Education, began June 1, 1944. Dr.
George M. Foster, social anthropologist, was replaced by Dr. Isabel
Kelly, when the former was transferred to Washington. Dr. Stanley
S. Newman, linguist, and Dr. Robert C. West, cultural geographer,
are the other two Institute of Social Anthropology representatives in
Mexico.

During the fiscal year 1947 these scientists have given five courses in
social anthropology, linguistics, and cultural geography. The scene
of field research was shifted in January 1947 from the Tarascan area,
described in last year’s report, to the Totonac Indian area east of
Mexico City. Two monograph-length papers dealing with the Taras-
cans have been submitted by Smithsonian personnel for publication
in the series of the Institute of Social Anthropology. A number of
student papers have appeared in Mexican sources, and longer mono-
graphs in Spanish are ready for publication.

Peru.—W ork began in Peru in January 1944, when that country had
no institution devoted essentially to social science teaching and re-
search. Subsequently a national center of social science, the Instituto
de Estudios Etnologicos, of the Ministry of Education, has been es-

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS

The River Basin Surveys were instituted in the fall of 1945 as a unit
of the Bureau of American Ethnology. ‘They were organized to carry
into effect a memorandum of understanding between the National
Park Service and the Smithsonian Institution. This memorandum
provided for surveys to determine the extent and nature of archeolog-
ical and paleontological remains occurring in areas to be flooded by
the construction of dams by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps
of Engineers, United States Army. The memorandum was signed
on August 7, 1945, by Newton B. Drury, Director of the National Park
Service, and on September 8, 1945, by Alexander Wetmore, Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, and was approved by Harold L. Ickes,
Secretary of the Interior, on October 9, 1945.

The first actual field work got under way in July 1946. A transfer
of $20,000 at the end of May 1946, by the Bureau of Reclamation
through the National Park Service, provided the necessary funds for
starting survey parties in the Missouri Basin. An additional $40,000
subsequently was made available by the Bureau of Reclamation for
work in this area during fiscal 1947. In September 1946 $27,000
was transferred by the Corps of Engineers, through the National
Park Service, for surveys outside of the Missouri Basin, and in March
1947 $4,500 was transferred by the Bureau of Reclamation for surveys
in the Columbia-Snake Basin. The Missouri Basin funds were for
use in both Bureau of Reclamation and Corps of Engineers projects.
The money provided by the Corps of Engineers was for Corps of
Engineers projects only, while the Columbia-Snake Basin money was
for use only in Bureau of Reclamation projects.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

The first survey parties were started in the Missouri Basin. These
were followed by investigations in Georgia, Virginia-North Carolina,
Texas, California, and the Columbia-Snake Basin. Supervision and
direction of the surveys in Georgia, Virginia-North Carolina, Texas,
and California were carried on from the main office in Washington.
Direction of the work in the Missouri Basin was from a field office
located at Lincoln, Nebr., and the Columbia-Snake Basin investiga-
tions were based on a field office established at Eugene, Oreg.

The Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers made the
entire salvage program possible through the transfer of funds, but
in addition both agencies contributed in no small degree to the suc-
cessful inception of the surveys through their cooperation in other
ways. Division and District Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation
personnel did much to facilitate the work of the survey men in the
field. In some areas transportation was provided, in others, neces-
sary labor was furnished to aid in emergency excavations, and else-
where temporary office space and storage facilities were made avail-
able at project headquarters. The genuine interest and desire to assist
on the part of all with whom the members of the River Basin Surveys
staff were associated in the various reservoir areas greatly aided the
progress of the investigations. The planning of a Nation-wide arche-
ological survey on a scale hitherto not believed possible became feasible
with the transfer of funds. The cooperation of the National Park
Service has been of marked benefit to the program and much credit
is due to its officials for the obtaining of the the necessary funds and
for the pleasant relationship existing between all the agencies involved
in the program.

Washington office—Throughout the fiscal year the main office of the
River Basin Surveys continued under the direction of Dr. Frank H. H.
Roberts, Jr. Carl F. Miller, archeologist, joined the staff on Novem-
ber 6, 1946. Miss Madeleine A. Bachand was appointed clerk-stenog-
rapher on March 3, 1947, and continued to serve throughout the year.

Mr. Miller was preparing to leave for the Pearl River project at
Bogalusa, La., on November 13, 1946, when a request was received
from the district engineer to postpone this work indefinitely because
the project had been stopped. Mr. Miller was then assigned to the
study of proposed projects in the Middle Atlantic Division of the Corps
of Engineers. He devoted his time to searching the literature for
information about sites which might be involved by construction pro-
grams in Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, and West Virginia.
During this period he also assisted the director in obtaining informa-
tion about proposed projects of the Bureau of Reclamation in various
parts of the country outside the Missouri Basin. On February 11,
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

1947, he left Washington for Richmond, Va., to confer with the offi-
cials at the Region 1 office of the National Park Service. From Rich-
mond he proceeded to Norfolk, Va., on February 18, to confer with the
district engineer, Corps of Engineers, about a survey of the Buggs
Island project on the Roanoke River. He left Norfolk on February
14 and went to South Hill, Va., where he established headquarters.
From that date until May 4 he surveyed all the Virginia and part of
the North Carolina portion of the reservoir basin. He then returned
to Washington and devoted the remainder of the fiscal year to pre-
paring a preliminary report on the results of the survey and making
recommendations and estimates for an excavation program in that
area,

Missouri Basin.—The first steps in initiating investigations in the
Missouri Basin were the establishment of field headquarters at Lincoln,
Nebr., and the assembling of personnel to undertake the field sur-
veys. Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, associate curator of archeology, United
States National Museum, who had been detailed to the River Basin
Surveys for that purpose, left Washington for Lincoln, Nebr., on
July 8, 1946, and upon his arrival there began instructing the person-
nel recruited for the project and assembling equipment needed in the
field. Through the courtesy of the University of Nebraska, office space
was provided at the University’s Laboratory of Anthropology. Later,
additional space was made available for a laboratory. This arrange-
ment continued throughout the year, and on June 30, 1947, both the
field office and the project laboratory were housed in the basement of
the Love Memorial Library on the university campus.

Actual reconnaissance started on August 3, 1946, and continued for
a period of 7 weeks, at the end of which weather conditions made it
necessary for the men to return to field headquarters. During this
time, 3 parties of 2 men each, limited because of inadequate transporta-
tion, covered more than 13,000 miles and made preliminary investiga-
tions at 28 top priority Bureau of Reclamation projects and at 5 Corps
of Engineers reservoirs. Since complete coverage of each reservoir
basin was in no case possible, additional surveys were recommended for
most of the units visited. One field party returned to the Harlan
County Reservoir, Nebr., for a period of 5 weeks, October 16 to Novem-
ber 23, 1946, and with the aid of local labor tested a number of sites
and removed material which was being damaged by erosion or being
excavated by unauthorized collectors.

Dr. Waldo R. Wedel returned to Washington and to his regular
duties at the National Museum on October 18, 1946. At this time
Paul L. Cooper was designated as acting director for the Lincoln of-
fice and continued to serve in that capacity until May 21, 1947, when
Dr. Wedel, who had again been detailed to the Surveys, returned to
Lincoln and resumed his supervision of the Missouri Basin program.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

During the fall and winter months at Lincoln the staff members
prepared and completed preliminary appraisal reports covering 25 of
the projects visited during the 1946 field season. By June 30 most
of these reports had been distributed to the National Park Service, the
Bureau of Reclamation, and the Corps of Engineers, or were ready to
be mailed. A general paper entitled “Prehistory and the Missouri
Valley Development Program: Summary Report on the Missouri
River Basin Archeological Survey in 1946,” written by Dr. Wedel, was
published in April in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,
volume 107, No. 6. Throughout this period the field laboratory
cleaned and cataloged more than 10,000 archeological specimens
gathered from 208 different sites, and in addition processed 426 photo-
graphic negatives and prepared approximately 2,200 prints for use in
the reports. Maps were drawn showing the location of sites in each
reservoir area, and the reports were mimeographed, assembled, and
made ready for distribution.

Field work was resumed in the latter part of April when three
archeological parties consisting of four men each and one paleontologi-
cal party consisting of one man, started for various reservoir projects.
The paleontologist subsequently was joined by a student assistant. In
addition to further investigations in reservoir areas visited during
the 1946 field season, other projects were added to the lst, and by
the end of the fiscal year a total of 44 Bureau of Reclamation and
6 Corps of Engineers projects had been surveyed. ‘They are located
in the States of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota,
Wyoming, and Montana. All parties were in the field on June 30
and expected to continue throughout the summer. During this
period Dr. Wedel directed operations in the Lincoln office and made
several visits to the field parties at the locations where they were
working. He also attended conferences between the regional officers
of the National Park Service and Bureau of Reclamation and Corps of
Engineers representatives.

The survey findings to date indicate that the Wyoming-Montana
area contains few pottery-bearing sites. There, as in the western
Dakotas, stone circles or “tipi-rings” are to be found in great num-
bers. Numerous outcrops of artifacts in strata exposed by stream
cuttings are plentiful and occur at varying depths below the surface.
Some of them give promise of containing material belonging to
early occupations, possibly even those of the Paleo-Indian, and they
may supply much needed data on that phase of Plains prehistory.
Throughout northern Kansas and northwestern Nebraska pithouse
villages attributed to semisedentary peoples predominate. Pottery-
bearing sites as well as “tipi-rings” occur on the tributaries of the
Missouri in North and South Dakota. Groups of mounds, village
remains, and former camp sites suggesting a more sedentary type of
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

occupation than that west of the Missouri occur in the Jamestown-
Devils Lake-Sheyenne area. Along the main stream of the Missouri
in the Dakotas are some of the largest and best preserved and most
impressive fortified Indian village sites in the United States. They
contain much of the story of the development of Arikara, Mandan,
and other upper Missouri cultures.

In many of the sites there is evidence of stratification and a se-
quence of cultures or a series of stages in cultural development.
Others contain the record of prehistoric floods, of silting and soil
erosion, of recurrent droughts, and fluctuation in climate. The ex-
cavation and the interpretation of the data contained in such sites
will contribute greatly, not only to the story of the growth and
development of the Plains Indians, but to our understanding of
conditions similar to those met and overcome by the aboriginal peoples.
For this reason the excavation and testing of several sites in three
Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs was recommended for the fiscal
year 1948, and for two important sites at one Corps of Engineers
project.

J. Joseph Bauxar, archeologist, joined the Missouri Basin staff
on July 15,1946. From that date until August 3 he devoted his time
to obtaining information on archeological remains in the Dakotas,
from reports on previous excavations and surveys in that area, and
in making preparations for work in the field. From August 3 until
September 22, in company with Paul L. Cooper, he engaged in a
preliminary reconnaissance of reservoir projects in Nebraska, South
Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. In these reservoir basins a
total of 68 sites were examined, site locations and descriptions being
recorded and surface collections made. During the laboratory period,
from September 22 until April 24, 1947, Mr. Bauxar prepared pre-
liminary reports for seven of the reservoirs, Angostura, Box Butte,
Bronco, Crosby, Deslacs, Fort Randall, and Jamestown, and pre-
pared a technical report entitled “Notes on the Archeology of the
Upper James and Sheyenne River Valleys and the Devils Lake
Area.” Hrom April 24 until May 7 he joined Wesley L. Bliss in
preliminary surveys of three reservoirs in Kansas, one in Colorado,
and five in Nebraska. During this period 25 sites, none of which had
been recorded previously, were visited. From May 7 to June 2 the
time was spent in collaborating with Wesley L. Bliss and Theodore
Hi. White on a report entitled “Preliminary Appraisal of Archeologi-
cal and Paleontological Resources of the Proposed Reservoirs in the
Republican River Basin.” On June 2 Mr. Bauxar left Lincoln, as
a member of the field party under the direction of Paul L. Cooper, to
make a reconnaissance of the Fort Randall Reservoir in South Da-
kota. ‘This work was still in progress at the end of the fiscal year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

Wesley L. Bliss was appointed to the Missouri Basin staff as an
archeologist on July 17, 1946. From July 17 to August 4 he was
occupied in making preparations for field reconnaissance in Wyoming
and Montana. He left Lincoln on August 4 and returned on Septem-
ber 22. In this period his party made preliminary surveys in six
reservoir areas in Wyoming, one which lies both in Wyoming and
Montana, and three in Montana. <A total of 74 archeological and pale-
ontological sites were found and recorded, and surface collections were
made from each. The fall and winter months, September 22, 1946,
until April 24, 1947, were spent at the Lincoln headquarters doing lab-
oratory and library research and in writing preliminary reports.
Reports were prepared for the Boysen, Tiber, and Medicine Lake Res-
ervoirs. In addition, Mr. Bliss prepared a draft of a paper entitled
“A Preliminary Appraisal of the Historic and Prehistoric Occupa-
tion of the Western Plains.” Some revision and the checking of some
material were needed to complete the paper. In the early spring of
1947 Bliss made several unofficial week-end visits with other members
of the staff to archeological sites along the Missouri, north of Kansas
City, and on the Big Blue River in Nebraska. These were for the
purpose of obtaining a wider knowledge of archeological manifesta-
tions in the area. In one case the trip was instrumental in stopping
the destruction of a group of mounds in the path of a real-estate sub-
division. From April 24 to May 7, 1947, Mr. Bliss, in association with
J. Joseph Bauxar, as previously noted, made a reconnaissance of nine
proposed reservoirs in Kansas, Colorado, and Montana. He assisted
in the preparation of the report on the Smokey Hill Sub-basin. On
June 10 Mr. Bliss left Lincoln in charge of a field party and proceeded
to the Glendo Reservoir in Wyoming where the remainder of the
month was devoted to an intensive survey. At the end of the fiscal
year, 30 sites had been located in addition to the ones noted during
the preliminary reconnaissance in the summer of 1946.

Paul L. Cooper, archeologist, became a member of the Missouri
Basin staff on July 15, 1946. Between that time and August 3 he as-
sisted in the preparations for work in the field and made two trips to
Omaha with Dr. Wedel for the purpose of consultation with members
of the National Park Service and the Corps of Engineers. On August
3 he left Lincoln with J. Joseph Bauxar to make preliminary surveys
at reservoir sites in Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Mon-
tana. As previously noted, 68 archeological and paleontological sites
were located during the course of this survey. Mr. Cooper returned
to the Lincoln headquarters on September 22, and from October 7,
1946, to May 21, 1947, was in charge of the operation of the office and
laboratory. During this period he planned and supervised the work
of the project personnel, compiled monthly progress reports for the
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

National Park Service and the Bureau of Reclamation, assisted in the
setting up of record systems in the laboratory and in establishing
methods for issuing the reports based on the field work and laboratory
studies. Owing to a shortage of personnel, it was necessary for Mr.
Cooper to devote much of his time to direct supervision and to many
of the actual operations involved in mimeographing and distributing
the preliminary appraisals of the archeological and paleontological
resources of the various reservoirs. In May Mr. Cooper represented
the River Basin Surveys at a symposium on the River Valley program
conducted by the Nebraska Academy of Sciences. During the period
May 21 to June 2, 1947, Mr. Cooper prepared reports on Heart Butte,
Dickenson, Deerfield, Shadehill, Blue Horse, Sheyenne, and Garrison
Reservoirs, and on the Devils Lake area. Mr. Cooper left Lincoln on
June 3, 1947, in charge of a field party which was to undertake a pre-
liminary reconnaissance of the Fort Randall Reservoir on the Missouri
River in South Dakota. This reconnaissance was still in progress on
June 30, at which time 60 archeological sites had been located and
recorded.

Robert B. Cumming, Jr., archeologist, was added to the staff as
laboratory supervisor at the Lincoln headquarters on October 1, 1946,
Since the laboratory was then being moved to new quarters in the
basement of the Love Memorial Library building, Mr. Cumming began
work by assisting in the formulation of the laboratory plan and plac-
ing the equipment in order so that routine work could proceed. Dur-
ing the fall and winter months he assisted in planning and initiating
basic laboratory methods. A triplicate filing system was devised in
which information covering approximately 175 sites was filed in a site
file, a reservoir file, and a reserve file. A photographic file system
was organized wherein prints were mounted on 5- by 8-inch cards bear-
ing descriptive information and were filed in accordance with a stand-
ard trinomial system consisting of symbols for the State, county, and
site. The negatives were filed in a separate cabinet using the same
system for identification. Mr. Cumming also formulated the system
for cleaning, cataloging, and storing the specimens and assisted in
initiating an inventory procedure for equipment and supplies which
he maintained throughout the year. In addition, he assisted in super-
vising the maintenance of equipment. He also assisted in the work
and supervision of the preparation of illustrations, drafting of site
maps, typing, mimeographing, proofreading, and assembling of the
preliminary reports. During such times as the field directors were
absent from the headquarters office, he handled the business routine
in the office. At the close of the fiscal year Mr. Cumming was engaged
in processing the records sent in from the field for 50 sites located after
resumption of the survey work. Because the laboratory was under-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY TL

staffed during much of the year, it was necessary for Mr. Cumming
to perform tasks which should have been done by laboratory workers.
This condition was relieved somewhat during the last few weeks of
the fiscal year when several part-time workers were added to the staff.
This enabled Mr. Cumming to devote more time to the technical
aspects of the laboratory problem.

Jack T. Hughes, archeologist, was appointed to the Missouri Basin
staff on July 15, 1946. From then until August 4 he assisted in the
preparations for field work and received instructions as to the manner
in which the surveys were to be conducted. On August 4 he left
Lincoln with Wesley L. Bliss for a preliminary reconnaissance of
Bureau of Reclamation reservoir sites in Wyoming and Montana. He
returned to Lincoln on September 22 after having assisted in the ex-
amination of the 10 reservoirs previously mentioned in the discussion
of the work of Mr. Bliss. During the period from September 22,
1946, to May 3, 1947, Mr. Hughes engaged in library research, labora-
tory analysis of specimens, and the preparation of reports. Prelimi-
nary appraisals were written for the Glendo, Kortes, Boysen, Anchor,
Lake Solitude, and Oregon Basin Reservoirs in Wyoming, the Yellow-
tail Reservoir in Wyoming and Montana, and the Canyon Ferry Res-
ervoir in Montana. ‘Technical reports were also written for Glendo,
Kortes, Boysen, Anchor, Oregon Basin, and Yellowtail. From May
3 to May 12, 1947, Mr. Hughes participated with Marvin F. Kivett,
in a brief reconnaissance of seven proposed reservoir sites in the Lower
Platte Basin of Nebraska. After his return to Lincoln, he assisted
in the preparation of the preliminary appraisal of the archeological
resources of this group of reservoirs in the Lower Platte Basin of
Nebraska. On June 10 he left Lincoln with the field party under Wes-
ley L. Bliss and spent the remainder of the month at the Glendo
Reservoir in eastern Wyoming.

Marvin F. Kivett joined the Surveys staff on July 15, 1946, as arche-
ologist. On August 2 he left Lincoln to make a reconnaissance of eight
reservoir areas in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado, This work con-
tinued until September 20, 1946, when he returned to Lincoln. In the
course of 7 weeks spent in the field, a total of 75 archeological sites were
recorded in the 8 reservoir areas; 60 of these sites were unreported
prior to the reconnaissance. On October 16 Mr. Kivett went to the
Harlan County Reservoir, Nebr., where he carried on an extensive
survey until November 23. This included excavation in a prehistoric
ossuary and limited test excavations in four occupational areas, This
work produced much information on the nature of the archeological
remains in the area. From November 24, 1946, to May 2, 1947, Mr.
Kivett worked at headquarters in Lincoln writing preliminary ap-
praisals of the resources of the eight reservoirs visited during the

777488—48——-6
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

summer field season and in analyzing the data and specimens collected
and in preparing technical reports. The preliminary reports com-
pleted and mimeographed for distribution were on the Kirwin, Cedar
Bluff, and Kanopolis Reservoirs in Kansas; the Enders, Harlan
County, and Medicine Creek Reservoirs in Nebraska; and the Cherry
Creek and Wray Reservoirs in Colorado. Mr. Kivett left Lincoln on
May 38, 1947, in company with Jack T. Hughes. From then until May
19 they made a preliminary reconnaissance of six reservoirs in the
Lower Platte River Sub-basin. <A total of 19 previously unreported
archeological sites were located during this period. After his return
to Lincoln, Mr. Kivett prepared preliminary reports on the Lower
Platte River Basin including all the information obtained from the
six reservoirs visited. The period from June 1 to June 9 was spent in
preparing for a preliminary reconnaissance of the Garrison Reservoir
in North Dakota. Mr. Kivett and his party left Lincoln for North
Dakota on June 9, and at the end of the year they were engaged in a
survey of the Garrison Reservoir.

Theodore E. White, paleontologist, was appointed to the general
River Basin Surveys staff on April 15, 1947. From that date until
April 26 he devoted his time to studying collections of fossil material
from the Missouri Basin in the United States National Museum. On
April 27 he left Washington for Lincoln, Nebr., and on April 29 joined
the Missouri Basin staff. He left Lincoln on May 2 and spent 6 days
in a reconnaissance of proposed reservoir areas in the Lower Platte
Sub-basin in north central Nebraska. During this time he visited
seven reservoir basins finding fossil remains in only one. These were
reworked material of little scientific value. Dr. White returned to
the Lincoln headquarters on May 9 and left on May 18 to make a recon-
naissance of the Republican and Smokey Hill Sub-basins in south-
western Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado. This work continued until
June 6, during which time he visited nine reservoirs in Nebraska, eight
in Kansas, and two in Colorado. Seven of these sites were recom-
mended for a more detailed survey on the basis of material found
and the extent of the exposures. From June 6 to June 13 Dr. White
worked at the Lincoln headquarters preparing reports and recom-
mendations for the various reservoirs which he had examined. On
June 13 he left Lincoln to examine proposed reservoir areas in the
North Platte Sub-basin in Wyoming, the Cheyenne River Sub-basin
in Wyoming and South Dakota, and smaller sub-basins in North and
South Dakota. This reconnaissance lasted until June 28, and during
the period three reservoirs were visited in Wyoming, six in South
Dakota and four in North Dakota. Three of the reservoirs were rec-
ommended for more detailed investigation. White returned to Lin-
coln on June 28 and at the end of the fiscal year was preparing to
start for further survey work in Wyoming and Montana.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 73

Several students were employed as members of the various field
parties for the Surveys beginning in June 1947. Robert L. Hall and
Warren L. Wittry left Lincoln on June 2 with the Cooper party for
the Fort Randall Reservoir in South Dakota, and at the end of the
fiscal year were occupied in the survey of that area. John L. Essex,
Gordon F. McKenzie, and Leo L. Stewart left Lincoln on June 9 as
members of the Kivett party to make a reconnaissance of the Garrison
Reservoir area in North Dakota. Mr. Essex had previously assisted
Mr. Kivett in the work at the Harlan County Reservoir, Nebr., in
November 1946. H. G. Pierce joined the Bliss party and left Lincoln
on June 10 to assist in the survey at the Glendo Reservoir in Wyoming.
He was still with the party at the end of the fiscal year. John C.
Donohoe was employed on June 27 to assist the paleontologist, Dr.
Theodore E. White.

Georgia.—Intensive survey of the Allatoona Reservoir area on the

towah River in Georgia was carried on during the period Novem-
ber 12, 1946, to April 1, 1947. This survey was made by Joseph R.
Caldwell, of the Division of Archeology, United States National Mu-
seum, who was detailed to the River Basin Surveys for that purpose.
Caldwell located 206 archeological sites representing a record of thou-
sands of years of diverse human cultures. Information obtained from
this survey has added materially to the aboriginal history of that part
of Georgia. Full knowledge, however, cannot be gained without ex-
cavation of some of the sites and the testing of others. In view of
this the preliminary report, prepared by Mr. Caldwell and distributed
to the National Park Service and the Corps of Engineers, recom-
mends the excavation of 10 sites and the testing of 33 others. A re-
quest for further funds for this purpose has been made by the National
Park Service to the Corps of Engineers, but at the end of the fiscal
year no response had been received to the request. The specimens col-
lected from the sites examined during the course of this survey were
transferred to the National Museum on April 17, 1947.

Virginia-North Carolina.—The archeological reconnaissance of the
Buggs Island project on the Roanoke River was carried on during the
period of February 14 to May 1, 1947. This work was under the super-
vision of Carl I’. Miller of the River Basin Surveys staff. During the
course of the investigations, 94 archeological sites were located, 2 of
which are extremely important as they appear to represent an eastern
phase of the so-called Folsom culture which flourished in the western
plains during the closing days of the last Ice Age. Other sites are pre-
Colonial and some date from the early Colonial period. The latter
are significant as they contain material characteristic of the late seven-
teenth-century contact with European culture and their investigation
would throw considerable light on this little-known era. Excavation
of 14 sites including the 2 eastern Folsom examples and the testing of
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

5 others has been recommended. A preliminary report on the Buggs
Island Reservoir was completed but had not been processed for dis-
tribution at the end of the fiscal year.

Texas.—River Basin Surveys were started in Texas in March 1947
when, through the kindness and cooperation of the authorities, a field
base and headquarters were established at the Department of Anthro-
pology of the University of Texas at Austin. A survey of the Addicks
Reservoir on South Mayde Creek, a tributary of Buffalo Bayou,
near Houston, got under way March 27 and was still in progress at the
close of the fiscal year. The Addicks project is not a reservoir in the
true sense of the word, but a flood-prevention dam which will not
retain water in its basin for more than 2 or 3 weeks at a time. As
a consequence, most of the sites located in the basin will be available
for study or excavation during most of the year. A series of nine
sites were found, however, which were being destroyed by stream ac-
tion, by construction work on the dam, or by indiscriminate and unau-
thorized digging. As a consequence, it was necessary to shift from a
reconnaissance type of survey to an intensive testing procedure to
salvage as much information as possible. Six of them were examined
by digging a number of test pits in various portions of the areas which
they covered, and subsequently two of the six were extensively excava-
ted. The cooperation of the district engineer, Col. D. W. Griffiths, in
supplying a crew of 10 men and a foreman for a period of several
weeks made these excavations possible. One of the excavated sites
consisted of a stratified midden containing a sequence of several cul-
tural horizons. Work on the site was started on May 29 and completed
on June 13. The second was started on June 16 and was still being
dug at the end of the fiscal year. The information and material from
these two sites will provide a fairly complete sequence showing the
development of aboriginal culture in this area over a comparatively
long period of time. During this period, the Indians progressed from
a simple hunting group to a sedentary agricultural and pottery-
making people. The data obtained are a significant contribution to the
hitherto little-known pre-Columbian history of this part of Texas.

The Hords Creek Reservoir on Hords Creek, near Coleman, was sur-
veyed during the period May 6 to May 17, 1947. Only eight sites
were found in the reservoir basin. Six of them were burned rock
middens and two were open camp sites. None gave indication of
being of sufficient importance to warrant further investigation. Com-
parable material is available elsewhere in locations which will not be
inundated. Unless construction work should reveal subsurface de-
posits of archeological material, no additional work will be required
in this reservoir.

The Whitney Dam area on the Brazos River north of Waco was

year. By June 30 a little over half of the basin had been covered.
Numerous sites had been located and recorded, and a number had
been trenched for additional information. Several small rock shel-
ters were excavated to salvage material which was being disturbed by
unauthorized collectors. Two laborers for digging test trenches and
for excavating in the shelters were supplied by the resident engineer.
The Brazos flows through an important archeological and paleon-
tological area in Texas and much information is contained in the sites
which will be flooded by the Whitney Dam. On the basis of data
already obtained by the survey, a number of key sites will be recom-
mended for excavation.

Joe Ben Wheat, archeologist, was appointed to the Surveys in Texas
on March 20,1947. He left Austin on March 25 for Galveston where
he conferred with the district engineer and obtained information
about the priority of various Corps of Engineer projects in Texas.
From Galveston he proceeded to the Barker Reservoir near Houston.
He found that the project was so near completion that there was no
possibility of salvaging archeological information from that area.
Construction on the Barker Dam had completely destroyed one large
mound and obliterated any evidence of occupation areas. As a con-
sequence he proceeded to the nearby Addicks Dam and began a sur-
vey of that area. After learning that much of the reservoir basin
would be under water only at rare intervals, Mr. Wheat turned his
attention to six sites in the immediate vicinity of the dam which
would be destroyed either as a result of construction or by erosion
from stream action. All these were tested, and from the information
thus obtained he concluded that two of them should be excavated as
they contained a sequence of materials showing a number of cultural
changes. In this connection he went to Galveston on May 20 and con-
ferred with Colonel Griffiths, the district engineer. As a result of
this conference, Mr. Wheat was furnished an excavation crew, trans-
portation, and the equipment necessary for conducting the excava-
tions. He returned to Addicks on May 22, and was able to begin
actual excavations on May 29. Digging was still in progress on
June 30.

Robert L. Stephenson, archeologist, joined the Surveys in Texas on
April 28. From that date until May 5 he worked at Austin, conferring
with members of the Museum staff at the University, studying collec-
tions of archeological material, and making preparations for field
reconnaissance. He left Austin on May 6 for the Hords Creek Reser-
voir. From May 7 through May 17 he examined the Hords Creek
Reservoir Basin, locating and recording eight archeological sites. On
May 18 he left Coleman for Waco where he conferred with Frank
H. Watt, of the Central Texas Archeological Association, obtaining
information about archeological sites along the Brazos River, and
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

particularly in the area to be flooded by the Whitney Dam. On May
19 he went to Whitney and conferred with the Resident Engineer.
On May 20 he began the actual survey of the Whitney Dam area and
continued with that work to the end of the fiscal year. During the
course of his investigations he interviewed numerous local residents,
obtaining all the information possible pertaining to the occurrence of
archeological sites, and studied collections of artifacts which had been
gathered from sites in the area. In addition he made note of various
historic remains and obtained such data as were available about them.
This information was forwarded to the regional office of the National
Park Service at Santa Fe, N. Mex., for the benefit of the Park Service
historians.

California——Archeological surveys were started in California in
May 1947. Through the cooperation of the Department of Anthro-
pology of the University of California, at Berkeley, headquarters for
the Surveys were made available. During the period from March 21
through June 28, 1947, six Corps of Engineers proposed reservoir
basins were surveyed. They were Pine Flat on King’s River, Terminus
on Kaweah River, Success on Tule River, Isabella on Kern River,
Folsom on American River, and Coyote Valley on the east fork of
the Russian River. A total of 59 sites were located, and of this number
8 have been recommended for excavation or partial excavation.

Some immediate contributions to the archeological knowledge of
California were derived from the surveys. Two aboriginal soapstone
quarries and three pictograph sites, none of which had been described
previously in archeological literature, were located. Surface collec-
tions of sherds of the unique and little-known Yokuts-Mona pottery
will permit a more extensive description of the type from archeological
sources than has previously been possible.

Franklin Fenenga, archeologist, was appointed to the California
surveys on March 21. He made all the surveys in the six reservoirs
listed above, prepared the preliminary reports on their archeological
resources, and made recommendations for further work. On June
28 Mr. Fenenga left Berkeley, Calif., for Eugene, Oreg., and at the
end of the fiscal year was starting a survey of the Detroit Reservoir
in the Willamette Valley.

During the course of the surveys in California Mr. Fenenga em-
ployed several student assistants. Stephen C. Cappannari served in
that capacity from May 8 to 11 inclusive; Francis A. Riddell, May
29-June 1, and June 12-15; Harry S. Riddell, Jr., April 17-20; and
Clarence E. Smith, April 1--6, May 1-4 and 19-25.

Columbia-Snake Basin.—The program for surveys in the Columbia-
Snake Basin was just getting under way at the close of the fiscal year.
Dr. Philip Drucker, anthropologist on the regular staff of the Bureau
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY LE

of American Ethnology, was detailed to the River Basin Surveys for
the purpose of directing the work in this area. On June 30 he had
established field headquarters at Eugene, where the Department of
Anthropology of the University of Oregon provided oilice and labora-
tory space. Two field parties left Eugene on the morning of June 30,
one to make a reconnaissance of the Detroit Reservoir, a Corps of
Engineers project on the North Santiam River, in the Willamette
Valley, Oreg., and the other to make investigations at the Cascade
Reservoir on the North Fork Payette River in Idaho. Plans for the
summer called for the survey of 4 Corps of Engineers and 12 Bureau
of Reclamation projects.

Dr. Drucker left Washington on June 17, 1947, for San Francisco,
Calif. He spent the day of June 18 at Lincoln, Nebr., studying the
operational procedure being used in the Missouri Basin surveys and
the laboratory arrangements for processing and cataloging specimens
received from the field. He arrived in San Francisco on the 19th and
spent the following 2 days in conference with the regional officers of
Region 4 of the National Park Service and members of the Department
of Anthropology at the University of California in Berkeley. On
June 22 he left San Francisco for Portland, Oreg., arriving on the
23d. At Portland he spent 2 days discussing plans for the surveys
with Regional Archeologist Louis R. Caywood of the National Park
Service, regional ofiicials of the Bureau of Reclamation, and repre-
sentatives of the district engineer of the Corps of Engineers. At this
time he also made arrangements for the field headquarters at Eugene.
He returned to San Francisco on June 24 and reported the results
of his trip to Portland to the regional office of the National Park
Service. He also recruited personnel for the field parties and made
arrangements for the shipment of equipment from Berkeley to Eu-
gene. He left Berkeley on June 28, arriving at Eugene, Oreg., on the
29th. He left Eugene on June 30 with the field party proceeding to
the Cascade Reservoir.

Clarence E. Smith, archeologist, was appointed to the Columbia-
Snake Basin surveys on June 25. He spent the following 2 days
assisting Dr. Drucker and Franklin Fenenga in making preparations
for the summer’s field work. On June 28 he left Berkeley in company
with Fenenga for Eugene, Oreg. They arrived at Eugene on the
29th and on the morning of the 30th left for the Detroit Reservoir.

Richard D. Daugherty, archeologist, was appointed to the
Columbia-Snake Basin staff on June 30, and left the same day for the
Cascade Reservoir in Idaho.

Francis A. Riddell joined the Surveys staff on June 26, as field
assistant. He left Berkeley, Calif., on June 28 and arrived at Eugene,
Oreg., on June 29. On June 30 he left Eugene in company with Mr.
Daugherty and Mr. Drucker for the Cascade Reservoir.
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Cooperating institutions.—The River Basin Surveys have been for-
tunate in receiving wholehearted cooperation from local institutions
in many portions of the country. Not only has space for field offices
and laboratories been provided together with the assistance and advice
of members of the various staffs, as at the University of Nebraska, the
University of Texas, the University of California, and the University
of Oregon, but in a number of cases units in the survey program have
been taken over and are being worked by universities and local organ-
izations. This active cooperation has relieved the River Basin Sur-
veys of a considerable burden and has made for more rapid progress
throughout the country as a whole.

In Pennsylvania the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Com-
mission helped with the program. The University of Kentucky as-
sumed responsibility for investigations at the Wolf Creek and Dewey
Reservoir projects in that State. The Alabama Museum of Natural
History conducted surveys along the lower Chattahoochee River Basin
in Alabama in areas which will be inundated. The Ohio State Mu-
seum at Columbus investigated Corps of Engineers projects in that
State. The University of Missouri, in cooperation with the Missouri
Resources Museum and the Missouri Archeological Society, started
surveys and excavations in that portion of the Bull Shoals Reservoir,
on the White River, which lies in Missouri and at several Corps of
Engineers projects on the Osage River. The Department of An-
thropology of the University of Chicago and the Illinois State Mu-
seum at Springfield agreed to cooperate in a survey of the Illinois
River Basin where 17 Corps of Engineers projects are proposed. The
University of Oklahoma examined and reported on two reservoirs,
one of which, the Wister, will inundate extensive and important
archeological material. The University of Nebraska cooperated both
in the search for and the excavation of paleontological material and
in archeological reconnaissance. The Nebraska State Historical So-
ciety assisted in the survey work and also did some digging in sites
which will be destroyed by construction work. The South Dakota
Historical Society did some survey work and also some excavation.
The University of North Dakota and the North Dakota Historical
Society cooperated in making a survey at the Heart Butte Reservoir
and in testing a number of sites in that area. The University of Colo-
rado assumed responsibility for a survey of eight reservoir basins in
the Colorado-Big Thompson project and for more intensive investi-
gation at the Wray Reservoir in eastern Colorado. The University
of Denver planned surveys of a number of reservoirs in the Blue
River-South Platte project and of two in the Arkansas River Basin
south of Pueblo. Western State College took over the examination
of a group of reservoirs along the Gunnison River in western Colorado.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 79

The Archeological Survey Association of Southern California, spon-
sored by a number of museums in that area, started the investigation
of a number of Corps of Engineers projects in southern California.
The University of Washington surveyed a number of proposed reser-
voir basins in that State and made all the information available to
the Columbia-Snake Basin group at Eugene. It also did some exca-
vation work.

The Reports of Progress prepared by the cooperating organizations
are sent to the River Basin Surveys for coordination and are then for-
warded to the National Park Service. All the information obtained
thus becomes a part of the record of the River Basin Surveys in
general.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

The editorial work of the Bureau continued during the year under
the immediate direction of the editor, M. Helen Palmer. ‘There were

LIBRARY

The Library of the Bureau has continued in charge of the librarian,
Miss Miriam B. Ketchum, assisted by M. L. Fiester, who was appointed
March 17, 1947.

The total accessions in the library as of June 30, 1947, were 34,462.
There were 148 new accessions during the fiscal year, by purchase, gift,
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

and exchange. Many of the foreign exchanges which lapsed during
the war have again resumed, and good progress has been made in filling
the gaps, brought about by the war, in periodical sets.

Cards on hand for domestic periodicals have been typed, and the
shelf list for this classification is now complete. A beginning has been
made on typing the cards for serial publications of domestic societies
and institutions, and this will soon be finished.

The labeling of sets of publications of domestic societies and institu-
tions and all the domestic periodicals has been completed, and the
labeling of the foreign serial publications has begun.

ILLUSTRATIONS

From late fall of 1946 up to June 30, 1947, E. G. Cassedy, illustrator,
spent most of the time, with the exception of time taken out to prepare
weather graphs, work for the Editorial Division, and miscellaneous
maps and plates, on the restoration of the old Indian negatives of the
Bureau of American Ethnology. With the help of Mr. Brostrup this
work has been progressing very satisfactorily and many negatives
which were important historically and which were about to be lost
have been preserved for coming generations.

ARCHIVES

Miss Mae W. Tucker continued the work of operating and cataloging
the manuscript and photographic archives of the Bureau. In addi-
tion to furnishing material for routine requests, some special requests
for photographic prints requiring urgent attention have been filled.
Visitors desiring to consult material in the archives have been given the
required assistance.

The greater part of the time has been given to work on the manu-
script catalog which is being prepared for publication, to include all
the unpublished manuscript material in the Bureau archives. The
data for this catalog has been typed on individual cards for each item
and is ready for final assembling.

A new file-print collection consisting of prints made from the re-
photographed and retouched negatives in the Bureau collection has
been started and will continue as the new prints are made. On Mr.
Cassedy’s recommendation, an extra set of prints is being made along
with the file prints, this set to be preserved for possible emergency use.

Some time is necessarily required for research work in connection
with both the manuscript material and the photographs.

SPECIAL PHOTOGRAPHIC RESTORATION PROJECT

The Bureau of American Ethnology ever since its inception in 1879
has maintained a collection of photographic negatives of North Ameri-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Sl

can Indians. The file had its origin with the famous “Jackson” col-
lection of over 1,000 negatives which was brought to the Bureau by
Major Powell from the directorship of the United States Geological
Survey. This unique and vaiuable group has been supplemented by
about 11,000 additional negatives obtained from various sources in-
cluding the field trips of the first 40 years, the exposures made in
Washington of the visiting Indian delegations, gifts, and purchases.
Nowhere else in this country is there a more complete photographic
record of the Indians who figured prominently in peace and war
during the important opening of the West in the nineteenth century.
In several instances the only known photographs of important char-
acters of this period are in this collection.

The great bulk of this collection was made before 1900 in the early
days of photography, and often under extremely adverse field condi-
tions of heat and bulky weight. These factors have contributed toward
a deterioration of the negative image. ‘This deterioration fortunately
has started around the edges of the negative and is progressing toward
the center, still leaving the figure and facial characteristics quite legi-
ble. However, if allowed to go on unchecked this collection will have
disintegrated unto uselessness.

During this fiscal year it was determined to inaugurate a systematic
program of restoration and preservation of this unique collection. The
continuous demand for reprints from these negatives, especially those
being used for publication, made this restoration imperative.

In February 1947 the services of a photographer, John O. Brostrup,
were obtained. The photographer and the scientific illustrator have
begun the program of restoration and preservation of these negatives.
The following system was devised and is being used in this work:

(1) Chemical improvement and cleaning of the original negative.
(2) Making a uniform enlarged print from the original negative,
cropping out destroyed and objectionable background areas. (3) Res-
toration of missing areas, and improvement of backgrounds by the
scientific illustrator with the minimum alteration necessary to pre-
serve faithfully the original negative. (4) Copying the restored en-
largement to uniform 8 by 10 inch size. (5) Printing of permanent
file prints.

All the processing is being carried out with the intent of insuring as
great a degree of permanence as possible.

First priority is being given those negatives which are needed to
supply prints for pay orders, i. e., those for which there is an imme-
diate demand. Second priority are those negatives which are in the
most advanced stages of deterioration.

At the beginning of the work in February an inspection was made
of each negative, and those requiring early restoration were listed.
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

A file of restored prints is being built up, and inspection in the
offices of the Bureau of American Ethnology is invited.

COLLECTIONS

Collections transferred by the Bureau of American Ethnology to the
Department of Anthropology, United States National Museum, dur-
ing the fiscal year were as follows:

Accession No. Collection

176066. 65 ethnological specimens from the Rio Vaupés in Colombia and Brazil.
Collected by Paul H. Allen.

176157. 3 ethnological specimens from the Navaho Indians. Collected by Dr.
John P. Harrington, at Fort Defiance, Ariz., in 1939.

176347. 1 ceremonial cane from the Iroquois Indians of Six Nations Reserve,
Canada. Collected by J. N. B. Hewitt, June 1916.

MISCELLANEOUS

During the course of the year information was furnished by mem-
bers of the Bureau staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the
American Indians, both past and present, of both continents. Vari-
ous specimens sent to the Bureau were identified and data on them
furnished for their owners.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sim: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1947.

Although shipping was suspended during September, October, and
November because of shipping and trucking strikes, the allotment for
transportation was practically exhausted by the end of March. There-
fore it was necessary to curtail sharply shipping during the last 3
months of the fiscal year.

The number of packages received for transmission during the year
was 703,798, an increase over the previous year of 163,296. The
weight of these packages was 773,975 pounds, an increase of 301,676
pounds. The average weight of the individual packages is approxi-
mately 1 pound, 2 ounces, as compared to the average of the previous
year of approximately 14 ounces—an indication that the institutions
are still shipping material held during the war. The material re-
ceived from both foreign and domestic sources for distribution is
classified as shown in the following table:

The packages are forwarded partly by mail direct to the addressees
and partly by freight to the exchange bureaus. The number of boxes
shipped was 2,578, a decrease of 539. Of the boxes shipped 638 were
for depositories of full sets of the United States Government docu-
ments furnished in exchange for the official publications of foreign
governments for deposit in the Library of Congress. The number of
packages forwarded by mail was 164,305.

84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Of the material accumulated at the Institution during the war, there
remained at the beginning of the fiscal year 196,082 pounds. This war
backlog was reduced to 69,020 but owing to enforced decrease in
shipments during the last quarter of the year the actual backlog at the
end of the year was 110,998 pounds.

Consignments are now forwarded to all countries except Rumania
and Yugoslavia. Shipments to these countries will probably be re-
sumed during the coming year. The notable resumptions of exchange
are with Germany and Japan, which were effected with the cooperation
of the Civil Affairs Division of he War Department.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official publications received
to be sent in return for the official publications sent by foreign govern-
ments for deposit in the Library of Congress is 93 (56 full and 37
partial sets). The depository for Germany has been changed as
indicated in the list and the set formerly sent to the League of Nations
is now sent to the United Nations.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1947.

The regular appropriation for the operations of the Zoo was
$393,420. A supplemental appropriation of $39,100 for salary in-
creases authorized by Congress was also available, making a total of
$432,500. Subject to minor changes in final bills, a total of $425,748
was expended for all purposes and an unexpended balance of $6,752
remains. Inability to fill many of the positions for considerable
periods resulted in salary savings which were available to apply on
salary increases that had been authorized by Congress, thereby reduc-
ing the amount that was needed in the supplemental appropriation.

During the war equipment had deteriorated and stocks of materials
and supplies had become seriously depleted in many instances. By
diligent search the Zoo has been able to replace or repair some of the
equipment and replenish some of the supplies and materials. The
close of the fiscal year finds the Zoo short as to many items, but as a
whole in a definitely better condition than prevailed a year ago as to
exhibition animals, personnel, equipment, materials, supplies, and
general condition of structures and grounds.

During the past year a slight improvement in the supply of animals
for exhibition has enabled the Zoo partially te replenish the stock.

Physical improvements included the completion of 870 square yards
of sidewalk; surface treatment of nearly all the main roads, a small
parking area opposite the large-mammal house, the road back of the
bird house, and the service road from the silver-gull cage to the bird
house. Excellent progress has been made in painting, which is a con-
tinuous operation in an establishment of the size and type of the
National Zoological Park. The general appearance of the grounds
has been very materially improved by pruning, clearing of under-
brush, cutting down weeds, and renewing and mowing lawns, all of
which had been seriously neglected during the war period. During
the summer of 1946 excellent progress was made in fighting poison ivy
by spraying with ammonium sulfamate. This procedure was con-
tinued during the summer of 1947, and already a great reduction in
this pest is noticeable. The fight against poison ivy was greatly

90
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY QO}

facilitated by the cooperation of the Department of Agriculture,
Bureau of Plant Industry, in lending a power spray. Before 1947
the Zoo has each year received numerous reports of ivy poisoning in
the Park, but up to midsummer of 1947 no cases have been reported.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

A small addition to the personnel is needed to enable the Zoo to
carry on the work in an efficient manner and permit employees to take
the leave to which they are legally entitled. The Zoo hag been under-
manned throughout the entire period of its existence, and with the
adoption of the 40-hour week, the situation has become particularly
acute.

As the years go by the need becomes more pressing for new buildings
to replace antiquated, dilapidated structures that are still used to
house animals. Preliminary planning has been taken up with the
Public Works Administration for construction of these buildings
when economic conditions justify.

The condition of the Administration Building, which is now about
142 years old and has had no major improvements or rehabilitation
for many years, is such that it cannot be kept in presentable condition,
and the excessive dampness is injurious to equipment, records, photo-
graphs, negatives, and books, as well as to the health of the employees
who work in the building.

VISITORS

Before the war the attendance at the Park was much greater on
Saturdays and Sundays than on the earlier days of the week. Since
the war there has been a surprisingly uniform attendance throughout
the week, even Monday and Tuesday consistently showing good
attendance. Throughout the year it was noticeable that there was a
consistent increased attendance of visitors over the previous year, the
final tabulation showing an increase for the year of 858,341.

About 2 p. m. each day the cars then parked in the Zoo are counted
by the Zoo police and listed according to the State, Territory, or coun-
try from which they came. This is, of course, not a census of the
cars coming to the Zoo but is valuable in showing the percentage of
attendance by States of people in private automobiles. ‘The tabula-
tion for the fiscal year 1947 is as follows:

The cars that made up the remaining 12.67 percent came from
every one of the remaining States, as well as from Alaska, Alberta,
Argentina, Australia, British Columbia, Canal Zone, Cuba, Hawaii,
Manitoba, Mexico, New Brunswick, Nicaragua, Nova Scotia, Ontario,
Panama, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and Sweden.

It is well known that District of Columbia, Maryland, and Vir-
ginia cars bring to the Zoo many people from other parts of the
United States and of the world, but no figures are available on which
to base percentages,

THE EXHIBITS

The quality of specimens on exhibition has been fairly satisfactory
during the year. The total number of specimens on hand June 30,
1947, was 454 more than on the corresponding date in 1946, the prin-
cipal increase being in the number of birds and amphibians.

The outstanding exhibits during the year were penguins. Four
species, the emperor, macaroni, rock-hopper, and adelie, were brought
from the Antarctic by the United States Naval Antarctic Expedi-
tion through the interest of Rear Adm. Richard E. Byrd and Ad-
miral Richard H. Cruzen. Two other species, the Humboldt and jack-
ass, were already in the Zoo or were obtained from other sources.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 93

Thirty-four ocellated turkeys were brought to the Zoo by Dr. D. 8.
Newill, who had obtained them in Guatemala. These turkeys have
been very rare in collections and make an interesting exhibit. Five
were retained and the rest distributed by Dr. Newill to other zoos.

Other interesting birds were two gray hornbills from India, the
first of the species to be exhibited in the United States.

Three specimens of Troost’s turtle, two albino and one norinally
colored, were deposited by James Nelson Gowanloch. All were
young, only about 2 inches in diameter, but were outstanding be-
cause of the extreme rarity of albino turtles. These are a beautiful
light cream color through which shows the pattern of the normal
coloration. They have pink eyes and a bright red spot on the neck
that is characteristic of the species.

Exhibits of very small creatures of more than ordinary interest
were three different species of tiny frogs: the green and black arrow-
poison frogs, red and black frogs, and yellow and black atelopus.

Other additions to the collection that were of unusual interest were:
A young great gray kangaroo, which was a gift from the people of
Australia to the people of the United States and was flown to Wash-
ington on a nonstop flight September 30-October 1, 1946, from Perth,
Australia, to Washington, D. C., by the United States Navy plane
Truculent Turtle; a young Alaska brown bear received through the
interest of members of the force of the Alaska Game Commission and
the Fish and Wildlife Service; an Arabian gazelle presented to
the Zoo by W. W. Shaffer; a spectacled bear from the Andes region,
obtained by purchase; a baby potto born to a pair that had been
brought to the Zoo by the Smithsonian-Firestone Expedition to Li-
beria in 1940; pigmy green cardinals; the short-legged lizard from
Cuba; five young specimens of the giant salamander of Japan, which
were received by the United States Army as a gift from the school chil-
dren of Japan to the school children of the United States, particularly
through the interest of Brig. Gen. John W. O’Brien, Chief, Scien-
tific and Technica] Division, GHQ, SCAP, and Dr. Austin Brues
and Lieutenant Kelly. These were collected through Dr. Tadamichi
Koga, Director, Uyeno Zoological Garden, Tokyo, Japan.

ACQUISITION OF SPECIMENS

Specimens for the Zoo collection are acquired by gift, deposit, pur-
chase, and births or hatchings. While depositors are at liberty to
remove the specimens that they deposit with the Zoo, many leave
the specimens for the rest of their lives,

During the year the Zoo received a number of shipments of live
specimens by air without a single loss. Some of these animals were
rare or delicate, and had they been transported by the usual means,
94 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

might have died en route. The experiences of other zoos and animal
dealers have been similarly successful, suggesting that shipment of
live animals by air may be the most satisfactory method.

APPENDIX 8
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1947:

The Observatory has two divisions: (1) The original Division of
Astrophysical Research, engaged primarily in a study of solar radia-
tion, and (2) the more recently established Division of Radiation and
Organisms, engaged in a study of the effects of radiation on organisms.

Both divisions of the Observatory helped to celebrate the one-
hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Smithsonian Institution
by participating in a special exhibit illustrating the activities of the
Institution. Mechanical working models were displayed showing
typical instruments as used by the Observatory at Camp Lee, Va., and
also showing types of research in the Division of Radiation and Organ-
isms, with emphasis placed on the role of light in the growth and de-
velopment of plants.

(1) DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

Work in Washington.—As in the past, our first concern has been to
appraise the solar-constant values received from our field stations and
to plan and develop improvements in instrumental equipment and
methods. Our plans have seemed unduly slow in fulfillment, but by
way of anticipation we may state that in the near future at one of our
field stations we expect to try several innovations. These include an
improved vacuum bolometer, a fused quartz prism, and aluminized
mirrors in the optical path in place of stellite. The resulting large
increase in ultraviolet deflections should permit a more accurate study
of the day-to-day changes in this important region.

Our second concern has been the work at Camp Lee, Va., under con-
tract with the Office of the Quartermaster General, described in last
year’s report. The records of the Camp Lee measurements of sun and
sky radiation have been compiled and prepared for publication in a
series of 11 reports to the Quartermaster General. The maintenance
of the equipment and observations at Camp Lee, and the preparation
of the reports have all been under the direction of William H. Hoover.
With the close of the fiscal year we have completed 18 months of con-

118
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 119

tinuous observations at Camp Lee. These records give the sun and
sky radiation in calories per square centimeter, for each hour of each
day divided as follows:
(1) Total intensity on a horizontal surface.
(2) Total intensity on a surface inclined 45° to the east.
(3) Ultraviolet intensity on a surface 45° to the east.
(4) Visible intensity 45° to the east.
(5) Infrared intensity 45° to the east.
(6) Intensity under a vycor filter which transmits all radiation, inclined 45°
to the south.
(7) Intensity under a black filter (Corning 2540) which cuts off the ultra-
violet and visible, and transmits the infrared, 45° to the south.
(8) Intensity under a yellow filter (Corning 3385) which cuts off the ultra-
violet and transmits the visible and infrared, 45° to the south.
(9) Ultraviolet intensity on a horizontal surface measured with a special
photoelectric ultraviolet meter.

The measurement and reduction of these voluminous records have
been tedious and time-consuming. Integrating devices which will
greatly simplify the work are being studied by Mr. Hoover and L. B.
Clark, and several such devices are under construction in our shops.

It is now 13 years since Dr. C. G. Abbot and the Director last deter-
mined the standard scale of solar radiation on Mount Wilson. In
anticipation of a new determination of this scale in the near future,
the double-barreled water-flow pyrheliometer used successfully in
1934 has been partially rebuilt. Rubber joints within the instrument
have been eliminated, copper-constantan thermojunctions replace the
former nickel-platinum junctions, and the thermoelement arrangement
is made more simple and efficient.

Dr. Abbot, research associate of the Observatory, has continued his
studies of the effects of solar changes on weather. He has also experi-
mented with a small solar engine, and has made preparations for a
further study of the energy spectra of stars which he will undertake
soon with the aid of the Mount Wilson 100-inch telescope.

At the request of Dr. Henryk Arctowski, and with the cooperation
of Dr. Abbot and the Secretary of the Institution, Dr. Alexander
Wetmore, arrangements were made for John McLean Hildt to come
to Washington to assist Dr. Arctowski for 1 year. Mr. Hildt, form-
erly meteorologist for the American Overseas Airlines, began work
with Dr. Arctowski on June 2, 1947. He will help organize and pre-
pare for publication the large amount of material which Dr. Arctowski
has accumulated.

Work in the field —In October 1946 Mr. Hoover and Paul Greeley
went to New Mexico and packed for shipment the entire equipment
of our Tyrone station, closed since February 1946. Arrangements
were made for the sale and disposal of the buildings and for the return

777488489
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

of the site to the custody of the Forest Service. The equipment was
sent to Miami, Fla., and stored pending the completion of a building
suitable for temporary solar observations at this sea-level location.

In further development of their studies of the causes of tent dete-
rioration, the Quartermaster Department decided to extend the Camp
Lee work to include measurements and exposures at a wet, sea-level
station and also at a dry, high-altitude station. Fortunately, in Miami,
Fla., the General Motors Corp. maintains a test field for the exposure
and testing of various materials. At the suggestion of Dr. S. J.
Kennedy, of the Military Planning Division, Office of the Quarter-
master General, a cooperative program was arranged between the
General Motors Corp., the Quartermaster Department, and the Smith-
sonian Institution. General Motors generously undertook to build a
special observing shelter at their test field, to house our spectrobolo-
metric equipment formerly in operation at Tyrone, N. Mex. This
building, a most satisfactory, well-insulated structure of cement brick,
was completed in April 1947. On May 1 F. A. Greeley, recently
director at our Montezuma, Chile, station, took charge of the installa-
tion of our equipment. Spectrobolometric observations are planned
for a period of 1 year.

During the war years our field stations were unavoidably under-
manned. It is therefore a satisfaction to state that each of the stations
now has two competent observers, as in prewar days.

During the fiscal year, a generous gift to further the work of the
Division was received from John A. Roebling. The staff of the
Observatory is sincerely grateful to Mr. Roebling, and to Dr. Abbot
through whose kindly interest the gift was received.

(2) DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS
(Report prepared by Harl S. Johnston, Chief of the Division)

General.—Members of the Division were consulted as usual by out-
side individuals and organizations regarding problems arising in the
field of radiation, its measurement and its effect on living matter.
Individual members also participated actively in the affairs of national
and local scientific organizations.

Research.—During the year the research of the Division of Radiation
and Organisms was concentrated under two projects: (1) Photosyn-
thesis, and (2) plant growth and development as influenced by light.

(1) Photosynthesis—The purpose of this project is to determine
the role of light, especially the wave-length effects, on the fixation of
carbon by green plants. Included in this project are studies (a) to
determine a more complete photosynthesis-action spectrum by use of
the special spectrographic method for the determination of carbon
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 121

dioxide as developed in this laboratory; () to determine chlorophyll
formation in the different regions of the spectrum; (¢) to investigate
the wave-length balance associated with optimum plant production

Many instrumental problems have arisen in connection with this
CO,-measuring method which have prevented the full use of the ap-
paratus in many of the planned experiments. New heat exchangers
have been installed for better temperature control and other improve-
ments made. After making 67 test runs, each of which required from
5 to 6 hours, all but two of the problems have been overcome.

The Division has recently obtained a suitable spectrophotometer
with which to continue its studies on chlorophyll formation. Work in
the study of wave-length balance and optimum plant growth has been
continued.

(2) Plant growth and development as influenced by light.—The pur-
poses of this project are (a) to determine the mechanism of dormancy
in light-sensitive seeds, and (6) to study developmental physiology
of grass seedlings.

Role of light in seed germination—It has long been known that
germination of many species of seeds under certain conditions is very
markedly stimulated by, or entirely dependent upon, irradiation.
About 10 years ago a cooperative investigation carried out in this
laboratory (Flint and McAlister) demonstrated that only certain por-
tions of the spectrum are stimulatory to germination whereas other
regions are inhibitory. The mechanism of these effects of light has
remained completely obscure, however.

Subsequent discoveries by other workers have suggested new ex-
perimental approaches to this problem which has been taken up again.
These discoveries are (1) that certain chemicals have the ability to
evoke germination in darkness and thus appear to act as substitutes
for light, and (2) that other chemicals act as germination inhibitors
in darkness but that light tends to overcome the inhibitory action.

A considerable variety of compounds has been tested for ability to
promote germination of lettuce seeds in darkness at temperatures
which, in the absence of specific stimulations, permit germination only
in light. A number of active substances have been found. The tests
are being continued in an attempt to correlate the physiological potency
with molecular architecture.

The light-sensitive inhibitory effect produced by coumarin does not
appear to be specific, being exhibited also by several other compounds
among the many which have been examined. Thus there is little
support for the suggestion made by other workers that coumarin, or
a chemically closely related substance, is responsible for the natural
light-sensitivity of lettuce seed. A report of this work is now being
prepared for publication.
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Evidence has been obtained, however, that dormancy and germina-
tion in this species is regulated, or at least influenced by an endo-
genous inhibitory substance. The nature of this inhibitor and the
mode of its action are being studied.

A critical review of the literature dealing with germination of
lettuce is also in preparation.

Effect of light on development of grass seedlings. Various phases
of this project have been carried forward as time permitted. A com-
parative investigation of the action spectrum for inhibition of meso-
cotyl growth in several species has been published. Tests on the
influence of several seed-disinfection treatments on subsequent seed-
ling development have been completed. Additional experiments have
been made on the effects of various salts on growth of etiolated oats.
In order to explain the observed gross morphological effects of light
and other environmental factors on mesocotyl elongation, a histologi-
cal study of this organ is in progress. A large number of slides have
been prepared and are being examined. It is planned to resume the
experiments on the interrelation between light and temperature as
affecting coleoptile and root growth as soon as the necessary equip-
ment, now being constructed, is available.

Volatile plant-growth inhibitors. It was observed that in a wooden
growth chamber, of which the interior had been varnished, the germi-
nation of several species of seeds was completely checked or greatly
retarded, although all the commonly recognized environmental con-
ditions were favorable for development. On removal from this cham-
ber normal development was resumed promptly. As the plants were
not in direct contact with the original box it appeared that a volatile
substance of great physiological activity was present. A large
number of subsequent tests showed that volatile inhibitors are indeed
produced, presumably as the result of oxidation processes, by films of
varnishes, drying oils, unsaturated fat acids, and by several species of
wood. The rapid and complete reversibility of the inhibition is espe-
cially remarkable. An agent with these properties might conceivably
be of considerable value both in plant physiological experimentation
and in practical plant culture. Studies on the identity of the respon-
sible substance, or substances, are in progress.

APPENDIX 9
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL AIR MUSEUM

Sm: On August 12, 1946, President Truman approved an act of
the Seventy-ninth Congress (H. R. 5144) establishing, under the
Smithsonian Institution, a bureau to be known as a National Air Mu-
seum. The act, now referred to as Public Law 722, stipulates that
this bureau shall be administered by the Smithsonian Institution
“with the advice of a board to be composed of the Commanding Gen-
eral of the Army Air Forces or his successor, the Chief of Naval Op-
erations or his successor, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and two citizens of the United States appointed by the President
from civilian life, who shall serve at the pleasure of the President.”

The purpose of the National Air Museum is to “memorialize the
national development of aviation; collect, preserve, and display aero-
nautical equipment of historical interest and significance; serve as
a repository for scientific equipment and data pertaining to the de-
velopment of aviation; and provide educational material for the his-
torical study of aviation.”

After the passage of the act, Dr. Wetmore discussed with Gen-
eral Spaatz and Admiral Nimitz the designation of appropriate rep-
resentatives of the Army Air Forces and the Navy to the Advisory
Board. As a result, General Spaatz appointed Maj. Gen. E. M.
Powers, and Admiral Nimitz appointed Rear Adm. H. B. Sallada.
The latter was replaced on May 1, 1947, by Rear Adm. A. M. Pride.
On December 3, 1946, President Truman appointed Grover Loening
and William B. Stout to be civilian members of the Advisory Board
as provided in the law.

On December 16 the first and organizational meeting of the Ad-
visory Board was held at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
At this meeting Dr. Wetmore was unanimously elected chairman. A
general discussion of the preliminary plans for an aeronautical
museum then followed, the Board calling attention to the danger of
losing valuable historical and technical material unless prompt action
were taken. Toward this end, Dr. Wetmore was requested to com-
municate immediately with leaders in all branches of aeronautics
requesting that such material be preserved for future review by the
Board.

The Board also discussed section 3 of the act which calls on the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution with the advice of the Ad-

124
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 125

visory Board “to investigate and survey suitable lands and buildings
for selection as a site for a national air museum and to make recom-
mendations to Congress for the acquisition of suitable lands and build-
ings for a national air museum.”

At this meeting, too, the preparation of estimates of appropriations
to implement the $50,000 authorized by the Congress for the purposes
of the act was discussed in detail, and Dr. Wetmore was advised by
the Board to submit the request to the Bureau of the Budget. This
was done, and on March 21, 1947, President Truman transmitted to
Congress “A Supplemental Estimate of Appropriation for the Fiscal
Year 1948 in the Amount of $50,000 for the Smithsonian Institution”
(H. R. Doc. No. 181). On April 30, 1947, Dr. Wetmore appeared
before the Independent Offices Subcommittee on Appropriations and
presented a brief statement on the origin of the National Air Museum
and on the need for the requested appropriation.

Following this initial meeting of the Advisory Board, approxi-
mately 200 letters were addressed to aeronautical interests through-
out the Nation. These letters called attention to the establishment
of the National Air Museum and urged the recipients to advise the
Board of any aeronautical items which in their estimation should be
considered for inclusion in the future National Air Museum. The
letter also requested that such materials be carefully preserved until
such time as the Board could make a study of them. The response
to these letters has been large and indicates the existence at this writ-
ing of much valuable museum material in private hands scattered
throughout the Nation. Both the Army and Navy, too, are assem-
bling and holding large quantities of valuable aeronautical material
of the recent war years. <A portion of these collections, and several
private collections, were inspected toward the close of the year at the
Institution’s own expense.

The major problem involved in the advancement of the National
Air Museum project is the acquisition of a storage depot for the tem-
porary assembly of the museum material. This is most essential to
prevent the permanent loss of material and to enable the Advisory
Board to determine and recommend to Congress suitable lands and
buildings for the new bureau. At the close of the year this vital
problem was still unsolved, nor had the Congress appropriated the
$50,000 authorized and requested for use in the fiscal year 1948.

Respectfully submitted.

Assistant to the Secretary for the National Air Museum.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 10
REPORT ON THE CANAL ZONE BIOLOGICAL AREA?

Sim: It gives me pleasure to present herewith the annual report of
the Canal Zone Biological Area, for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1947, As in past reports, there are included data regarding rainfall,
temperatures, relative humidity, and other data which are invaluable
to those coming to the island for study.

REGARDING THE ISLAND

As this is the first report published in several years, it is desirable to
include here some of the data that appeared in the earlier Barro
Colorado Island Biological Laboratory Reports—particularly so, be-
cause so Many new readers will want this information.

The island was reserved for scientific purposes by Governor J. J.
Morrow on April 17, 1923; hence in 1948 the island and its unique labo-
ratory will celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary. It is located in
Gatun Lake, about halfway between Gamboa and Gatun. Its width is
8.1 miles, its length 3.4 miles, and its area 3,609.6 acres, or 5.64 square
miles. Its coast line exceeds 25 miles. It is larger than the combined
areas of the familiar islands of Taboga, Taboguilla, Urava, Otoque,
Bona, Morro, Chamé, Estiva, Melones, Venado, Mandinga, Tabor, En-
sena, Patterson, Tortola, Naos, Culebra, Perico, and Flamenco.

The shore line of Gatun Lake is on the average 85 feet above sea
level, and the highest point on the island, 537 feet. There are 24
trails, marked off into 100-meter sections, so that not only are all parts
of the island available with ease, but the 100-meter designations give
it a sort of cross index; thus, for example, Wheeler-6 has a very definite
location. And since all trails eventually lead to the main laboratory,
no one has ever been known to be lost on the island.

As to buildings, there is a two-story main building 32 by 55 feet,
the lower floor including a dining room, and the upper floor lodging
rooms. There are two buildings 12 by 24 feet with two rooms each,
the ZMA and Barbour Houses, the latter with a large porch for labora-

1'Phis is the first report to be published since the Canal Zone Biological Area was placed
under the administration of the Smithsonian Institution. The first to the sixteenth reports,
for the years when the organization was known as the Barro Colorado Island Biological
Laboratory, were issued in mimeograph form, the last in 1940. During the war, owing to
military restrictions and other considerations, no reports were issued.

tory space. Then there is the Chapman House, also 12 by 24 feet, with
a wide porch; the lower floor is screened in and serves as a splendid
laboratory unit. The Eastman Kodak Co. has a building for its serv-
ice, deterioration, and corrosion tests, the lower floor serving as
workshop. There is a three-room library, and another building used
by the Resident Manager. The upper part of the kitchen is used as a
dormitory.

There are buildings at the end of the Barbour Trail, the Drayton
Trail, the Pearson Trail, the Zetek Trail, and at Burrunga Point, all
available for the use of scientists. At least two can live comfortably
in these houses.

Inquiries should be addressed either to Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Sec-
retary, Smithsonian Institution, Washington 25, D. C., or to James
Zetek, Resident Manager, Drawer C, Balboa, C. Z. Accredited scien-
tists receive an annual card pass on the railroad, and authority to pur-
chase in the commissaries. Living conditions on the island are very
comfortable, and working conditions good. Owing to the precautions
taken, the malaria hazard is nil, and the water supply is safe.

As the island force looks after the dormitories and the meals, it
means that the scientists are relieved of all housekeeping duties. Thus
their entire time is available for their research problems. Those who
have worked in the Tropics where such facilities are not available,
where drinking water must be boiled and malaria precautions taken
daily, know what it means to be relieved of these chores. Furthermore,
in many tropical localities good medical facilities are not within easy
reach, whereas on Barro Colorado Island the scientist is never more
than an hour from a Panama Canal dispensary, or an hour and a half
from Gorgas or Colon hospitals, where one finds the very best in medi-
cal or surgical services.

With rapid air mail and air express service the island is in very close
touch with the United States, and being under the United States flag,
it is almost like being in the States. On the other hand, the isolation
provided by an island does away with the many distractions so common
on the mainland.

THE ISLAND LITERATURE

Since the laboratory was established in 1923 as the Barro Colorado
Island Biological Laboratory, there have appeared 603 individual
published articles and books relating to studies made on the island.
This is an enviable record, equaled by very few institutions of this
sort. The field covered is vast, even including papers on studies made
here on cosmic rays. Many of the papers on physiology have paved the
way to other studies that have solved problems relative to certain
human diseases. A 3- by 5-inch card record is kept of these individual
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

books and papers. One index is alphabetical by authors, the other by
subjects.

The war halted the preparation and publication of many papers, as
it also curtailed the number able to come to the laboratory for studies.
During the war the laboratory was, of course, very active on problems
relating to the war, particularly deterioration, corrosion, fungi, chemi-
cal problems, and related matters, but very few of these findings will
appear in print. It is also known that papers have been published of
which we have no record. It is a difficult task to cull all the litera-
ture, and probably the index is only 80 percent complete. Neverthe-
less, it is an amazing record.

SCIENTISTS AND THEIR STUDIES

Dr. T. C. ScHNEIRLA, curator of the department of animal behav-
ior, American Museum of Natural History, perhaps the highest au-
thority living on the behavior pattern of army ants, spent from Feb-
ruary 7 to June 16, 1946, on the island, continuing his studies. A
summary of his findings follows:

“These studies on army-ant behavior and its biological basis were
begun on the island in 1932, and were continued in the rainy-season
periods of 1933, 1936, and 19388. The work began as an attempt to
analyze the complex behavior system of these ants as a case study of
‘instinct,’ but as it went along inevitably led into other special prob-
lems, such as the social organization of the army ants, and the rela-
tionship between reproductive processes and behavior.

“To investigate the last problem in particular a project was planned
for 1942; however, the war interfered. Since all the preceding studies
had been made in the rainy season, it was especially desirable to ob-
tain evidence on the activities and adaptations of the Ecitons in the
dry months. Plans for an intensive investigation under dry-season
conditions were resumed in 1946.

“The basis of the study was the surveying of activities and condi-
tions in two colonies, one of Hetton hamatum and one of /. burchell,
for as long a time as possible in the dry months. Other colonies of
these two species were kept on record as far as possible for briefer
periods, and supplementary field and laboratory tests were carried out
on relevant problems. The object was to learn as much as possible
about what changes may occur in the activities and in the brood pro-
duction of these ants in the dry season.

“Tf there is any other situation in the world today where such a
project involving correlated field and laboratory studies can be carried
out advantageously, I have yet to learn of its existence. The results
of this project illustrate the island’s advantages. On the day of my
arrival, February 7, I found a colony of Z. burchelli bivouacked on
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 129

Shannon trail just beyond No. 2, and this colony was kept on record
until just before departure on June 15—about 125 days in all. A
colony of Z. hamatum, found a few days later, was on record for nearly
as long. Approximately 50 other colonies of these 2 species were
studied more or less intensively during the 4 months.

“The findings, first of all, showed in convincing ways that the
periodic behavior changes (regular alternation of nomadic and
statary—i. e., sessile—colony behavior) that I have found invariable
for these ants in the rainy season also hold through the dry season.
Regular phases were found as follows: For £. hamatum, about 17 days
nomadic and about 20 days statary in alternation; for EB. burchelli,
about 12 days nomadic and 21 days statary in alternation. An inten-
sive study of colony brood-production, paralleling the behavior studies,
revealed that in colonies which survive the dry season with their queens,
new broods are produced at very regular intervals as in the rainy sea-
son. Further evidence was found that this regular brood-production,
based of course upon a very regular delivery of successive batches of
eggs by the queen, provides the causal basis for the described regularity
of colony behavior. For example, the queens of 2. hamatum produce
new batches of eggs at about 36-day intervals. This island study of
1946 shows that this remarkable performance ordinarily is continuous
throughout the year.

“The production of male individuals, it was found, occurs in the dry
season, at times characteristic of the species. Evidently in colonies
that produce males, only one brood of males per season is produced,
otherwise the broods are immense worker broods as in the rainy season.
The production of males was studied, from early larval stages to ma-
turity and dissemination by flight. A brood of (about 3,000, as a rule)
winged males requires about 3 weeks for its complete exodus through
nightly flights, after emergence. Results indicate that most of the
males that survive the flight reach other colonies (evidently through
chancing upon and following raiding trails to the bivouacs). The
flight evidently operates against adelphogamy, although some evi-
dence was obtained for occasional returns of males into their colonies
of origin. From this 1946 work a considerable part of the virtually
unknown problem of Eciton mating can be sketched in. More of it,
and especially how the wingless queens are produced, we hope to learn
in 1947-48, when a project is planned for studying transitional condi-
tions in the Ecitons from rainy to dry season months.”

Dr. James B. Hamizron, professor of anatomy, Long Island College
of Medicine, and one of the foremost authorities on hormones, initiated
a most interesting and promising line of research dealing with the
matter of baldness, a subject on which he has already published im-
portant papers. His experimental approach was through the three-
1380 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

toed sloth, the male of which has on its back a prominent bald area or
“tonsure.” This sloth, and some of the large apes, appear to be the
only animals that resemble man in that the adult males develop com-
mon baldness.

His observations thus far are in total agreement with the idea that
a bald spot of increasing size develops upon sexual maturation of the
male. It is still too early to report on his study of the anatomical
material he obtained on the island. The sloths used were obtained
through the cooperation of Mr. Shropshire and Lieutenant Keenan of
the United States Army Sanitary Corps. If the studies corroborate
the views outlined, then it will be important to study the pathogenesis
of this condition. Its etiology is apparently identical with that respon-
sible for other important pathological conditions, for example, hyper-
trophy and cancer of the prostate.

His present studies are only the beginnings of further ones. No
one so far has made this approach through the sloth, and while quite
a number of males and females received male hormone treatment, it is
necessary to follow the experiment through on a large scale. This
involves also a study of the sloths themselves, to learn how to keep
them alive in captivity for at least 6 months. In captivity the sloth
is not hardy, and no one as yet has made a serious study of the food
habits and other characters of these animals. hey are ideal for such
studies.

R. J. Kowat, entomologist in charge of the Gulfport, Miss., Labora-
tory of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, and Ento-
mologists Samuel Dews and Harmon Johnston, of the same regional
laboratory, began their studies about 4 years ago, upon the initiative of
Kowal. The object was to obtain information on effective methods of
preserving wood against deterioration due to termites and other organ-
isms, as well as to rot. To quote Kowal: “The severity of conditions
conducive to deterioration, and the excellent facilities for scientific
study, make the island an ideal location for such investigations.”

The studies began in 1943 when funds were made available through
the United States Forest Service, and the Coordinator of Inter-Ameri-
can Affairs. Proposals for this work came as an outgrowth of requests
for information from the Public Roads Administration, the War and
Navy Departments, and other agencies engaged in the war effort.
Briefly stated, the Inter-American Road became an urgent need, steel
for bridges was hard to get and its transportation a problem, and to
erect wood-preservation plants with creosote on the list of critical
materials was out of the question. Could we not poison soils at the
bridge abutments so as to eliminate the termite and rot hazard, and
could we utilize native resistant trees by the additional process of
sap-stream impregnation ?
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13h

In the spring of 1943 two types of experiments were established, one
to test the value of soil poisons in preventing damage by termites;
the other to determine whether tropical tree species could be impreg-
nated with water-soluble wood preservatives by the sap-stream method
of impregnation. Soil poisoning had been previously tested on a
small scale particularly in the treatment of soil along building founda-
tions to prevent the entrance of termites into wood structure. The
relative value of different soil poisons was not known, however, nor
was information available on their effectiveness under tropical condi-
tions. Thirty-nine different treatments were applied on Barro Colo-
rado Island, each treatment being replicated 10 times. The procedure
consisted of removing and treating 2 cubic feet of soil, replacing it,
and driving a stake into the center of the treated area. After 3 years’
exposure it was apparent that treatments by means of the so-called
“saw-kerf banding” and bore-hole techniques were the most effective.
In the case of several of the tree species, intake of the chemical was
not satisfactory and preservation consequently was poor.

In 1946 the Division, in cooperation with the Corps of Engineers
of the War Department, began investigations on problems of de-
terioration of wood and wood products confronting the Army. The
studies deal mainly with problems under military conditions, and
research is pointed toward development of practical methods of pre-
vention and control which can be readily applied by the Army using
materials immediately available on location. Several types of soil-
poisoning tests were established on Barro Colorado Island in Novem-
ber 1946. An experiment similar to that described above was installed
using numerous soil poisons and different dosages. Variations of the
method were also tested, one being the surface application of chemi-
cals and another the bore-hole method. A soil-poisoning experiment
known as the “platform test” was also established. In this test poisons
are applied to the soil surface by spraying or sprinkling, and the board
or “platform” to be protected is laid on the treated area. Dosages in
this test are considerably lighter than in tests described above. The
experiment is designed with the object of developing a method of
preventing damage to materials in storage dumps and similar
installations.

The above experiments conducted in cooperation with the War
Department comprise a total of approximately 100 treatments; all
have been replicated 10 times.

Experiments on impregnation of seasoned wood with preservatives
have been established in order to determine the methods and chemicals
most satisfactory for the protection of wood from insect attack. The
experiment, like those above, is designed to provide a reasonable
degree of preservation by practical methods using chemicals readily
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

available to the Army on location. Ten different chemicals and chemi-
cal mixtures were used in the experiment. Stakes 12 inches long were
treated by instant dip and by dips of 3 minutes, 1 hour and 12 hours.
Ten replications were made of all treatments. AJ] stakes were driven
into the soil to a depth of 6 inches.

A small amount of treated fabrics, conduit, and insulation is now
under test, and it is planned that more such material will be tested
in the future. In addition, experiments will be conducted to develop
methods and materials that might be of value in preventing attack
of wood by marine organisms.

Tueropors J. Martin, technologist of the Forest Products Labora-
tory at Madison, Wis., made several trips to the island in connection
with the installation and inspection of the various tests of plywoods,
glues, paints, resins, and other materials. Since most of this is covered
in the report of Mr. Middleswart, little need be added here.

It is always a great satisfaction to be able to give tribute where it
is due. The thoroughness of Mr. Martin’s work, his attention to
details, his ability to see and appreciate what too many would not note,
all were apparent during his work on the island.

Mrs. Exizaprra G. Hartmann, of New York City, spent a short
time on the island studying the bird life, preparatory to a more ex-
tended trip into Costa Rica. The abundance of life on the island, in
addition to the birds, crowded each day with no end of new experiences
and information and made her stay all too brief.

Dr. ALEXANDER Wermorn, Secretary, Smithsonian Institution,
epent 2 days and 1 night, all he could spare on his return from Jacqué,
and his urgent need to be back again in Washington. While all too
brief, the period was spent in discussions with the Resident Manager
of the island’s more urgent needs.

G. E. Errxson, of the graduate school of Harvard University, spent
some time on the island in connection with his research problems on
the higher mammals.

C. C. Sorgr, chemist for Eastman Kodak Co., and in charge of their
research laboratory in Panama City, initiated and conducted on the
island the most varied studies in connection with deterioration and
corrosion of practically all the materials that enter into photography.
The outcome of these studies means, of course, better results for those
who do photographic work. Mr. Soper’s investigations dealt not only
with corrosion of lenses and its elimination, but also with the proper-
ties and keeping qualities of film, particularly color, papers, and other
photographic supplies, and also with the matter of packing and pack-
aging. It is the first really serious study of these multiple problems.
The upper floor of the building built this year is used for these tests
and studies.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Leo

Mr. Soper, through his knowledge of photography and photographic
processes, has been extremely helpful to scientists on the island. It
is hardly necessary to point out here the difficulties, as well as losses,
incurred during the past war, because of the lack of previous studies
of this nature. It is to the point to emphasize the soundness of the
decision made to go to the humid Tropics to make these studies, rather
than to depend on tests made in the continental United States by
simulating conditions in the Tropics. It is possible to duplicate tem-
peratures and humidities, but it is not possible to duplicate the often
rapid changes, and certainly not the action of micro-organisms.

The past war has shown the wisdom as well as the urgency for
conducting in the Tropics studies on corrosion, deterioration, packing
and packaging, and similar problems, and particularly the need to
study and test the great number of new materials which still lack sufti-
cient service tests to show the true limits of their best usage.

Dr. GraHam Bett Farrcuip, medical entomologist to the Gorgas
Memorial Laboratory, whose splendid work during the past war is
so well known, made several brief visits to the island in connection
with his entomological studies.

Dr. Cuas. F. QuAINTANCE, spent a little over 8 months of his sab-
batical leave on the Isthmus, a few months thereof on the island. As
head of the biology department of Eastern Oregon College, his main
objective was to learn as much as possible about the plants and animals
of the Tropics, and particularly the environmental conditions. To
supplement his notes and collections, he also took a great number of
kodachrome photographs for use in his teaching.

It is one thing to read about the Tropics and then pass on this
second-hand knowledge to students. But it is only when one sees,
feels, hears, tastes, and smells that which is the humid Tropics that
one is able to really teach about them. The past war emphasized the
paucity of men who have had actual experience in the Tropics.

Dr. Tuos. E. Snyper, senior entomologist of the Division of Forest
Insect Investigations, Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine,
United States Department of Agriculture, and one of our greatest
authorities on termites, came for a few weeks to discuss with the Resi-
dent Manager the extensive termite studies conducted on the island
since 1928. ‘The clearing of a piece of the immediate forest just behind
the present laboratory buildings, to provide needed space for buildings
and for water storage, necessitates the removal of several thousand of
the termite exposure tests to a new area.

During his stay he examined all the trail-end buildings, which are
also termite tests. A report on this is given elsewhere. The great
value of the island for such tests and studies has been attested and
emphasized so often that any repetition here becomes redundant.
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Dr. Grover C. Prrrs, Naval Medical Research Institute at Bethesda,
spent a very short period on the island because of difficulty in geiting
off in the midst of important research at that great Medical Center of
the Navy. Hastily, he writes as follows:

“Tet me review my objectives and results in visiting the island. By
profession I am a physiologist with strong leanings toward natural
history. Consequently, the purpose of my short visit was to gain
some familiarity with a tropical fauna and flora and to explore the
possibilities of making studies in comparative physiology there. A
secondary object was to determine what the island might have to offer
the 'Naval Medical Research Institute for purposes of field research.
Though I am now out of the Navy, I continue my affiliation with
NMRI as a civilian.

“Some results were obtained with regard to each objective. I iden-
tified and gained some familiarity with the following organisms, all
new to me: 52 species of birds, 14 species of mammals, 5 species of
reptiles, and an undetermined number of species of plants and inver-
tebrates.

“This is at least some indication of what a worker can accomplish
who desires to gain familiarity with the tropical biota and has only
1 week at his disposal.

“With regard to the opportunities for studies in comparative physi-
ology, they are legion. More studies in temperature control of the
type that Peter Morrison did are indicated. In the past I have done
some work on diurnal rhythms in various physiological functions.
The island with its many dirunal, nocturnal, and crepuscular crea-
tures offers boundless material for this type of study. One would
have to bring most of the specialized equipment needed, but the
usual laboratory facilities are available. I hope to pursue one of
these problems when time and finances provide the opportunity.”

A. V. Reenter, Jr., of Little Rock, Ark., visited the island for the
purpose of preparing a motion picture of the wildlife, preparatory
to a much longer stay later on. He exposed some 1,200 feet in color
during the 3 weeks. He also included 2 weeks in Chiriqui, where
he went in quest of the beautiful quetzal. Mr. Regnier reports:

“The finished film with titles and animated maps is about 900 feet
in length. The sequence on the island opens with the launch coming
in to the landing followed by a view of those arduous steps. Then
in quick flashes, the mango, banana, coconut, lime, lemon, and
orange trees. Following are scenes of Erikson and myself walking
along one of the trails looking up at the air plants on one of the
giant Bombacopsis trees. Other subjects are the tamandua, tree for-
micaria, three-toed sloth, marmosets, howlers, toucans and other birds,
the sensitive mimosa, the zebra swallowtail, the Heliconia, the beau-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 135

tiful blue princess Morpho, and of course, the coatis. My still photo-
graphs include many of the above subjects.

“As I mentioned on my arrival in the Zone, my trip was one of
examination to discover material for a full-length educational film.
In Chiriqui Province at the foot of El Volein de Chiriqui, I found
what I was looking for in the quetzal bird—they breed in March in
that region and are said to be easily accessible at that time. So far, I
believe only two persons have photographed them in color—Wolfgang
von Hagen and Luis Marden of the National Geographic. I hope to
make a complete film in color on the nesting habits of this beautiful
bird.

“Returning to the film which I made last summer, I have presented
it to several clubs and groups along with my own narration, and it
has been very well received. It has aroused a great deal of interest
in Panama in general and in Barro Colorado in particular.”

E. L. Mippieswart, technologist of the Forest Products Laboratory
at Madison, Wis., and at present with the State Commission of
Forestry of South Carolina, showed an intense interest in the life
of the island. His report follows, and it must be understood that it is
still too early for final conclusions. The fact remains that the island
certainly has all that is needed for tests of this sort.

“We were endeavoring to find a plywood which would withstand
tropical jungle conditions. We had some 1,500 samples of plywood
14 inches square made of 4 different species of wood (red gum, douglas
fir, cottonwood, and birch) glued with 12 different glues and glue
mixtures, and given 5 different surface treatments on exposure on the
island. One-half of the samples were placed on racks in the sunlight
and the other hali were placed on racks in the deep jungle to give a
comparison between the two conditions. The samples were made at
the laboratory in Madison, Wis., and flown to the Zone by the Army
Air Forces. They were placed on exposure in January 1946.

“The laboratory also sent the plywood wing-section panels for
exposure on B. C. I., which came shortly after I left the Canal Zone.
These wing sections were also sample sections of plywood used in
studying the effects of tropical weather conditions upon various glues
and woods used in making the plywoods and to find which glues and
woods are the most satisfactory for use in the Tropics.

“This covers the high points of our work there. I might add that
the conditions were most nearly ideal on B. C. I. for this study. It will
be some time before the results are compiled.”

Wuu1m KE. Lunpy, of the paymaster’s office of the Panama Canal,
and also secretary-treasurer of the Panama Canal Natural History
Society, spent 3 days during the rainy season on the island, and being
deeply interested in natural history, and a keen observer, his brief

777488S—48—10
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

report is of much interest. It shows what others, who are much more
versed in zoology, can expect to find. And since these animals on the
island are as nature has them, not in cages, but in the open, to see and
observe them is to know them as they really are. To the ecologist, to
the student of animal behavior, to the general naturalist, it is to see,
smell, hear, feel, and touch that which is life. It is something that
books can only feebly portray. We have the orderly sequence of ex-
ternal nature, we have the living organism moving about in this
environment inhabited by other species, and we have that continuous
adjustment which constitutes life.

This is what Lundy saw in but 3 days: 10 bands of howler monkeys,
3 of the white capuchins, 2 of marmosets. He saw any number of the
coatimundi, peccary, squirrels, 2 deer, many nequi, 1 tayra, and best of
all, 1 night monkey (Goldman’s Aotus zonalis). He came across 10
“armies” of army ants, and one huge bivouac of these most interesting
ants. Among the birds he saw large numbers of toucans, parrots, and
guans, also the tinamou, pileated woodpeckers, ant-shrikes, motmots,
two king vultures, many of the other vultures, the scarlet-capped mani-
kin, Ghiesbrecht’s hawk, and others. Among the insects, perhaps the
most spectacular were the large metallic blue Morpho butterflies,
another butterfly with transparent front wings and pink hind wings,
and the graceful large “helicopter” dragonfly.

COMMENTS OF SCIENTISTS

“Life at the Island was a pleasant experience and I am telling my
associates about conditions there. It seems to me to be an ideal place
for the conduct of experimental studies of many types, and I would
like to thank you for the opportunity to work there. The research
station is certainly a well-run place.”—Dr. James B. Hamiuron.

“My report is incomplete, of course, since it includes no statement
of how thrilling and how great a privilege it was to return to the island
to continue my work where f left it off, to meet and talk with you
again, and to enjoy once more directly the countless emotional and
perceptual satisfactions that come from hiking and strolling around,
and from just standing in the many well-remembered Jandmarks,
probably I had best leave the sentimental part of the return unsaid; at
least the above sentence is sufficiently full of rushing verbal chaos to
represent how I felt on February 7, 1946, and all of the days I was
there.”—Dr. T. C. ScuHnerrua.

“The severity of conditions conductive to deterioration and the ex-
cellent facilities for scientific study, make the island an ideal location
for such investigations.”—JosrpH Kowat.

“As for the Naval Medical Research Institute, the island would be a
most useful proving ground for many of the things developed here.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 137

These include insecticides and repellents, warm-weather clothing and
footgear, a new type of salt tablet for men perspiring profusely, etc.
In addition to all of the above, the island is a wonderful place for a
boreal biologist to broaden his outlook.”—Grovmr C. Prrrs.

“With reference to my visit to B. C. L., I certainly want to put in my
plug. I surely enjoyed my visit there, not only with reference to my
work, but with reference to the many, many other phases of study
adapted to the area. I certainly had my eyes opened as to jungle con-
ditions and the flora and fauna therein. I have never been in a place
where so many phases of biology in general could be so interestingly
studied and all from the same roof. The beauty of the flowers and
colorful birds still stands out in my memories of B. C. L., not to forget
the hours I sat and watched the busy little monkeys playing in the
trees.

“The fellowship which I experienced with the fellow scientists work-
ing and visiting the island, as well as the friendly reception of the
native people welcoming me to B. C. I., is an experience never to be
forgotten.”—Eucens L. Mippteswarr.

“To the visitors of the Barro Colorado Laboratory! May they get
from the trails in the rain forest such an inspiration as will last them
through life and make them ardent protectors of the tropical forests
of the world, for without their aid these marvels of beauty will surely
disappear forever.”—Davip Fatrcu i.

“T take up my pen with the greatest of pleasure to record the out-
standing impressions left by my recent visit to Barro Colorado Island.
When I recall the expeditions I have made into Central American
jungles, the great expense involved, and the meager equipment per-
mitted by pack-mule transportation, the difficulties encountered and
the usual sequellae of tropical malaria and dysentery, it is only natural
that I should be struck first of all by the propinquity and safety of
Barro Colorado Island.

“Just to think that one can drop off a chair car at a railway station
in a civilized community, and after half an hour’s launch ride find
one’s self in the heart of virgin tropical forest, is to feel a wave of
admiration for the foresight of those who secured the reservation of
this great tract to scientific purposes. It is a biologist’s fantasy come
true, and I hope as time goes on that more and more of our scientific
institutions will come to its support, so that the potentialities of the
laboratory can be developed in all directions, and utilized to the full at
all times of the year.

“TY believe there is nothing like it in the world. There are great
botanical and zoological gardens in the Tropics which represent an
attempt to facilitate man’s acquaintance with tropical nature by trans-
porting the flora and fauna to some easily accessible place. Barro
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Colorado Island has the opposite aim, of enabling man to transport
himself into the midst of tropical nature and to live there for any
period of time in comfort and safety.

“Nature lovers as well as scientists can enjoy this unusual experience.
My wife was as excited as I was on our morning walks, at the hundred
and one novel things she had read about but never seen. We were
equally lucky in sighting mammals and birds before they took alarm,
while the trees and plants always stood still to be admired. I was
struck by the intelligence and alertness of our Panamanian guide
Silvestre, and his knowledge of jungle life.

“In short, I am enthusiastic about Barro Colorado and I will not
fail to endeavor to communicate this feeling to my friends.”—Dr. L. W.
Hackett, Rockefeller Foundation.

“As the result of my recent visit to Barro Colorado Island I feel
impelled to write you to express my gratification with what is being
accomplished. J remember my pleasure when the isolation of this area
by the waters of Gatun Lake was first foreseen, and the decision was
made to make it a permanent preserve for native life. Yet I can see
now that I had a very inadequate idea of the realities of nature in
that area; and an equally inadequate idea of what might be attempted
in the way of scientific observation, experiment, and systematic record.
I had, indeed, a general idea of the abundance of life in the jungle,
but the scope of your records was a revelation. This means, partly,
that the number of species is vastly greater than would be guessed,
even by most scientific men. It also means (you must allow me to
say this) that the work is being directed with wisdom and pushed with
energy. That such records as I saw should be even attempted would
seem to indicate the presence of a considerable staff, yet I could not
help seeing that it is largely your own work. It is greatly to be
hoped that your work will not only be continued, but augmented by
further cooperation.”—Nervin M. FENNEMAN.

“T find it difficult to say anything about my general impression of
Barro Colorado that does not sound exaggerated, trite, or exactly like
something I have read somewhere else. Perhaps you will know how
I feel when I say that I wish (financial considerations aside) that a
stay on Barro Colorado could be required of every candidate for the
doctor’s degree in either botany or zoology. You may be amused to
know that about a week after we returned to Chicago we went to
Warren Woods, a beach-maple forest about 70 miles east of Chicago.
It was very hot, 96° F., and the mosquitoes were indescribably thick.
It was impossible to accomplish much, and we left after about 20
minutes. We both agreed then that we would a thousand times rather
have the ticks and red bugs of B. C. I. than the mosquitoes of our
temperate forests. In fact, when I begin to recount the virtues of that
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 139

little island it seems almost too good to be true. Of course we realize
that the virtues of Barro Colorado Island are not entirely the result of
its natural equipment. The well-marked trails, the laboratory, the
library, the excellent living accommodations, the trail-end houses, and
all the rest are the end results of a lot of patient planning and unending
attention to detail. The summer of 1939 was the most stimulating and
happiest one of our lives.”—RatpH and Miiprep Bucussaum.

“The island is better than ever; and after knocking about in parts
of the world where it is very difficult to organize one’s work, I appreci-
ate more keenly than ever the possibilities Barro Colorado offers for
profitable natural history studies which can be begun immediately
upon arrival.”—ALEXANDER F’, SkutcH.

“All light talk aside, I have not seen any place in my travels which
compares with Barro Colorado Island in point of excitement of the
field-naturalist kind. In Java and Sumatra the Dutch have built
palatial Jaboratories, but these are far removed from the new, fresh,
wild jungle. In Ceylon the British have an agglomeration of build-
ings like the United States Department of Agriculture, but it is
surrounded on all sides by tea plantations. Everywhere it is the
destructive activity of man that is clearing off the jungle and replacing
the gorgeous forest with weedy growth or plantations of rubber trees
in rows. Hold the virgin character of Barro Colorado at all costs.

“Tell the visitors to take it from one who has just been there that
the conditions for studying tropical plants and animals are better at
Barro Colorado Island than anywhere I went in Sumatra or Java.”—
Davin Farrcu.

“Barro Colorado Island is one of the most astounding places I have
visited in any part of the world. Its value is tremendous for scientific
research, even for research that has economic importance. I sincerely
hope the day never comes when any of the land is devoted to investiga-
tions such as are now being carried on in many agricultural forest and
range experiment stations. The virgin character of Barro Colorado is
sufficient asset and I hope you will fight every move that may be made
to change this condition.” ——F rank EK. Eater.

“T must confess I was amazed at the systematic way in which the
trails are laid out and posted, the filing system in the library and the
many other modes and ways of doing things. I doubly appreciate
this because I have been places where such systems were not followed,
much to everyone’s disadvantage.”—Grorcr W. Prescort.

“Never again shall I make a trip like this one for merely 5 weeks.
If I cannot make a trip next summer I am certainly going to make
every effort to get down the following one. Caylor too, wants to get
back to Barro Colorado Island and go through with our contemplated
project of preparing a flora of the ferns of the region. We have a siz-
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

able collection of ferns now on hand. In my algae collection I find 250
samples, many of which are simply loaded with species and I have no
idea how many will appear in the final list. I think 500 would be a
very modest estimate and very likely there will be many more than
that when the diatoms are included.”—Groraz W. Prescort.

“Even without special precautions, the island would seem to be safer,
hygienically speaking, than most areas of like size in the United
States.

“Certainly all of the minimum requirements for successful labora-
tory work are fulfilled on the island. In addition to these minimum
facilities the laboratory possesses a remarkable versatility of equipment
as well as adequate laboratory space. And while it is obvious that
special equipment to suit the needs of the individual scientist must be
supplied by him, it is comforting to know that many laboratory necessi-
ties are accessible in a small clearing in a tropical rain forest.”—PauL
D. Voru.

“The island is more than ever a paradise for the biologist. Living
conditions are excellent, the food is fine, the resident staff efficient and
courteous. The forest offers a pageant of life which is the ideal labora-
tory for the study of the principles of biology. Not only has it proved
to be of great value for the undergraduates, but its worth for the
teacher has hardly been realized by morethanafew. very university
and college ought to send the members of its staff in the biological
sciences for a sojourn on the island, not once but periodically. It
would be an economical investment in the improvement of teaching.
This is especially true now when all emphasis is on the experimental
side with the result that so many workers know very little about the
organisms with which they work. The island will be an excellent place
for studies in plant and animal physiology. The rapid growth rate of
plants would aid such work tremendously.”—Rosrerr N. Woopworrtu.

“In addition to the value of publications based on work on Barro
Colorado, who can estimate the influence of observations, studies, and
photographs which have formed the basis of unnumbered addresses
in lecture hall and classroom, or the educational value of museum
exhibits depicting island life? In brief, during their 15 years as a
laboratory, the 4,000 acres we know as Barro Colorado have contrib-
uted more to our knowledge of tropical wildlife than any other area
of similar extent in America—perhaps in the world.”—Franx M.
CHAPMAN.

THE SPECIES INDEX
A 5- by 8-inch card index is kept for each species of plant and animal

definitely known from the island. Each card lists the scientific name,
the major division to which it belongs, and the family name; also the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 141

name of the collector, the name of the person who made the determina-
tion, when and where collected, and other pertinent details.

These cards are indexed first according to the major phyla—mam-
mals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, arthropods, etc.—which are
further subdivided into superorders, orders, etc., and finally by fam-
ilies. Under each family the genera are in alphabetical order, and
the species for each genus are also in alphabetical order.

This index is invaluable to the student. It isa unique record of the
life of the island. In 1940 the index covered a total of 4,924 species
of plants and animals, representing 2,805 genera. In plants alone
there were 747 genera and 1,487 species. Since 1940 new entries have
been made, but no count has been made of the present number, owing
to pressure of other duties, especially those concerned with the war
effort. A conservative estimate is about 7,000 species.

Extensive collections have been made of algae, fungi, and lichens, but
because of the war, reports on these have not yet been published.
Lesser collections were made in other groups. A conservative estimate
would be fully 700 species.

THE ISLAND HERBARIUM

The herbarium consists of 1,533 mounted specimens, representing
806 species, not including the mosses. These sheets are in genus
covers, and the collection is arranged in four major groups, the crypto-
gams, ferns, monocotyledons, and dicotyledons. In each of these
groups the genus covers are grouped according to the families, and
these, for convenience in handling, are alphabetically arranged. There
are on hand more than 2,500 additional named specimens as yet un-
mounted and these will probably swell the number of species to close
to 1,200.

The herbarium is a most valuable adjunct to a laboratory such as
ours. It does more than supplement the botanical library. Too often
botanical literature is of little help to one not a trained botanist, and
for this majority of students, the herbarium is what is needed.

NEEDS

The most urgent needs are for a concrete water tank to replace
wooden tanks now in bad condition; new septic tanks; painting of all
buildings, inside and out; herbarium and other storage cases; replace-
ment of bedding and purchase of additional furniture; and miscel-
Janeous repairs to buildings: It is estimated that these present most
urgent needs could be met at a cost of $10,000.

Other needs that should be met promptly are for a more adequate
supply of electricity; a new fireproof building to house the library,
photographic equipment, herbarium, and records; and adequate
142 §ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

animal cages to keep various creatures in captivity during scientific
investigations.

TERMITE-FREE BUILDINGS IN THE TROPICS

Is is possible to build comfortable, well-ventilated houses of lum-
ber and not have a termite hazard? The answer is “Yes.” However,
few architects go to the trouble of getting the necessary information.

We have 57 known species of termites in Panama and the Canal
Zone. Of these, 45 species occur on Barro Colorado Island. Two of
the most destructive in the world occur here, one of which is known
to eat through the lead sheathing of electrical cables. The rapidity
of destruction by some of the species is incredible. Some even work
in living trees, and we have records of fruit orchards destroyed by
them.

And yet on Barro Colorado Island we have buildings where we let
the termites do whatever they wanted to do—eat up the building
overnight if they could—and yet these buildings are in excellent
shape.

In 1926 we built a test house at the end of Drayton Trail, 16 feet
square and 10 feet high, set on wooden posts extending 3 feet into
the ground. The timber used was pressure treated with coal-tar
creosote and with zine chloride. The wallboard is treated with chro-
mated zine chloride. In the May 1947 number of Wood Preserving
News Dr. Thomas E. Snyder, senior entomologist of the Bureau of
Entomology and Plant Quarantine, published all details and results
of his inspection in February of this year, showing no damage any-
where due to termites, and yet termites tried to get a hold. The build-
ing is in excellent condition after 21 years. It is true that pressure
treatment increases the original cost of the timbers, but it is cheap in-
surance. A building of untreated timbers would have been destroyed
in less than a year.

At the end of the Pearson Trail we have the Fuertes House, built
in February 1931, 16 years ago. It is set on nine posts; hence there
is good ventilation under the house. With the exception of the shin-
gles, which are of red cedar (and need replacement), all the wood and
timbers, including posts, were treated with zinc-meta-arsenite. The
tables and chairs are also so treated. There is no damage anywhere to
the treated wood. The wallboard also was zinc-meta-arsenite treated.
It likewise is free of any termite damage. Test stakes of untreated
wood half-buried in the ground near the building were destroyed
within 8 months.

Furthermore, this zinc-meta-arsenite treated building is free of
cockroaches. No steps are taken to keep termites out of the building,
and no termite shields are used—hence, termites have absolute free-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 143

dom to work if they can. Yet the building is in as excellent shape
as when we first put it up. Here again, treated lumber costs perhaps
50 percent more, but as it gives freedom from termites, in a few years
it pays for itself.

The above two cases show that with treated timbers you can build a
termite-free house even where termites are extremely abundant and
active.

Tests on the island also show that one can build of untreated timbers
and have no termite hazard, provided a few simple precautions are
taken. The main requirement is to build a good thick concrete floor
which will extend out at least to the line of the eaves. The floor must
be well made, with no cracks. The secret is to make an inspection at
least once a week around this concrete floor, and if termites have
built any covered runways, introduce into these runways either pow-
dered calomel or finely powdered paris green. In this way the colony
is poisoned, and by watching a treated runway, it can easily be deter-
mined whether or not the job was well done. It takes so little time
and does not need superior knowledge. Of course there must be no
leaks, either in the roof or in the plumbing.

Of course, by the use of properly made termite shields, properly
installed, it is possible to keep termites out of buildings. Where it is
possible to install them, termite shields are cheap protection, but not
all buildings lend themselves to the use of shields. Soil poisons also
are the answer for some type of buildings, but vigilance is always
necessary, and inspection cannot be perfunctory.

Circular 683, United States Department of Agriculture, “Effective-
ness of Wood Preservatives in Preventing Attack by Termites,” by
Snyder and Zetek, gives a good picture of the extensive termite tests
on Barro Colorado Island since 1923. The annual progress reports by
Hunt and Snyder in the Annual Reports of the American Wood Pre-
servers’ Association give details of the more important of these tests.
Nearly 4,000 tests are involved, in addition to the Kowal-Dews-John-
ston series noted elsewhere in this report.

LIST OF THE TERMITES OF PANAMA AND THE CANAL ZONE

In this, the latest list, 57 species are represented, and of these, 45
are known from Barro Colorado Island (indicated by the initials
BCI). There are 13 new species which will be described in the near
future by Dr. Emerson. The Kalotermitidae are those commonly
known as the “dry-wood termites.” The Rhinotermitidae are the bad
actors, Coptotermes niger and Heterotermes tenuis being especially
noted for their destructiveness. Some of the Termitidae are also very
destructive. This list is by no means final. We feel that at least 15
more species will be discovered.

RAINFALL, TEMPERATURES, AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY, 1946

In the 22 years of record, 1946 was the third driest year. The rain-
fall amounted to only 87.38 inches, showing a deficiency of 21.48 inches.
This deficiency was most pronounced in the wet season, amounting to
17.93 inches. Only 2 months, July and September, had an excess,
which, however, was very slight—0.77 and 0.20, respectively. ‘There
was a total deficiency of 3.50 inches in the dry season, January to April,
inclusive; only March showed a small excess—0.25 inch. February
was the driest month (0.32 inch) and November the wettest (14.98
inches). Table 1 gives the total yearly rainfall, and the station aver-
age, for each year from 1925 to 1946, inclusive.

Table 2 gives the rainfall by months for the years 1945 and 1946, the
station average for each month, the excess or deficiency for each month
and the accumulated plus or minus, and also the maximum rains each
month for 5 and 10 minutes, and 1 and 24 hours. These maximum
values are consecutive wherever that maximum occurred; hence the
24-hour record is not necessarily from midnight to midnight.

Table 3 gives the number of hours of rain each month for 1946
and the total amount in inches, and then these data separated into
the four 6-hour periods. These data are of interest in that they indi-
cate when most rains may be expected. From 6a. m. to noon there is
less rainfall than from noon to 6 p. m.

Table 4 gives a summary and analysis of the 1946 rainfall for the
entire year and for the dry and wet seasons, both as to hours and days,
percentage of the total possible hours (if it rained every hour), and
these data are significant. With so much less rainfall in the dry
season, and particularly with so high a deficiency, the animals have
a hard time getting food. The peccary in the dry season is noticeably
thin—very different from his condition in the wet season when food
is more plentiful. The effects of moisture are profound. This strug-
gle for food is also reflected in the rate of reproduction in certain of
the mammals. <A bad year, deficient in rainfall and in food, increases
the rate of reproduction, and conversely, a year of abundant rainfall,
an abundance of food, shows in some mammals a falling off in this
rate.

In table 5 are given (1) the number of hours and the amount of
rains of 0.40 inch or more per hour, for each of the four 6-hour periods,
and (2) the three heaviest rains each month (midnight to midnight).
Rains of 0.40 inch per hour, if rather evenly distributed, will not
seriously hamper field work, but if such rains come down in 5 minutes,
it is another story.

148 | ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

During the dry season, there were no rains of 0.40 inch per hour
during 1947, and only 51 such hours in the wet season, amounting to
40.68 inches, or 46.6 of the total rainfall for the year. And these
40.68 inches fell during only 6.1 percent of the total hours we had
rain. This means that the balance, 46.70 inches, fell during 781 hours,
or an average of only .06 inch per hour. The three heaviest rains each
month amounted to a total of 45.59 inches in only 36 days. This leaves
only 41.79 inches for the remaining 197 days.

Considering now these three heaviest rains each month (midnight
to midnight), we have the following interesting data:

Dry season: 12 days, 3.08 inches, or 79.2 percent of the dry season total.

Wet season: 24 days, 42.53 inches, or 50.9 percent of the wet season total.
The year: 36 days, 45.61 inches, or 52 percent of the year’s total.

The remaining days when it rained show:

Dry season: 32 days, 0.32 inch, or an average of 0.01 inch per day of rain.
Wet season: 165 days, 40.96 inches, or an average of 0.248 inch per day of rain.
The year: 197 days, 41.79 inches, or an average of 0.212 inch per day of rain.

For comparison, the following tables are presented, covering the
rainfall for other localities in the Canal Zone and Republic of Panama
data on temperatures, relative humidities, barometric pressures, etc. ;
and the maximum and minimum yearly rains of record for 19 impor-
tant localities. These data are taken from the reports of the Chief
Meteorologist of the Panama Canal. They givea better understanding
of the climate, and it is only to be regretted that comparable data are
not available for a great many more localities in the Republic of Pan-
ama. To an ecologist, these data are of inestimable value.

FISCAL REPORT

During the fiscal year 1947, $16,095.88 was available, none of which
was appropriated by Congress. Of this amount, $13,140.29 was spent,
leaving on hand $2,955.59 to begin the new fiscal year. In addition to
this, $3,183.96 is still on deposit, representing local collections, a total
of $6,139.55, to which will be added the few table subscriptions, an
amount inadequate to take care of running expenses.

During the year $4,403.96 was collected as fees from scientists for
board and lodging, fees from visitors, and similar items. It is hard
to say how much will be collected during the 1948 fiscal year, but it is
almost certain that it will not be sufficient to carry us through the year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Tok

The organizations listed below continued to aid materially in the
support of the Laboratory through the payment of table fees:

It is believed that more scientists will now be able to come to the
island, and it is therefore imperative that more institutions and uni-
versities should help support the laboratory through table subscrip-
tions. It is gratifying to report that Eastman Kodak Co. increased
their subscription to $1,000 a year.

APPENDIX 11
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947:

In this second postwar year of rehabilitation the work of the library
was not greatly different in kind or amount from that of the previous
year. Books are integral parts of the world of practical affairs as well
as of ideas, and their production, distribution, and use, as well as their
conception, follow the changing times. With the coming of peace
there began a rise, not as yet very sharp, in the number of new books and
serials important for the library to acquire. Prices rose and are still
rising. The purchasing power of the inelastic allotment of book funds
has correspondingly decreased. Paper shortages continued to lmit
the size of editions, and not a few new books went so quickly out of
print as to make it difficult to get those for which prepublication orders
had not been placed. Many fine and desirable works came into the old
book market but prices were too high and funds too small to make it
possible to buy more than a few of those most immediately important to
the work of the Institution.

Among the more noteworthy of the 1,693 purchased books were the
following: Description Méthodique du Musée Céramique de la Manu-
facture Royale de Sévres, by Alexandre Brongiart and others, 1845;
Mammals of Amazonia, by Eladio da Cruz Lima, volume 1, 1945;
A Monograph of Oriental Cicadidae, by William Lucas Distant, 2
volumes, 1889-92; Histoire de la Locomotion Terrestre, les Chemins
de Fer, by Charles Dollfuss and Edgar de Geoffroy, 2 volumes, 1935;
Illustrationes Florae in Insularum Maris Pacifici, by Emmanual
Drake del Castillo, 6 portfolios, 1886-92; The Royal Commentaries of
Peru, written originally in Spanish by Garcilaso de la Vega, el Inca,
and rendered into English by Sir Paul Rycaut, 1688; Histoire et
Technique de la Montre Suisse de ses Origines 4 Nos Jours, 1945; The
Etched Work of Whistler, Illustrated by Reproductions in Collotype
of the Different States of the Plates, compiled, arranged, and described
by Edward G. Kennedy, 1 volume of text and 3 portfolios of plates,
1910; The Artists of America, a Series of Biographical Sketches of
American Artists, with Portraits and Designs on Steel, by C. Ed-
wards Lester, 1846; The New World; the First Pictures of America,
made by John White and Jacques Le Moyne and engraved by Theodore

De Bry, with Contemporary Narratives * * * edited and an-
notated by Stefan Lorant, 1946; Thomas Nast, his Period and his
Pictures, by Albert Bigelow Paine, 1904; Denmarks Fugle, by E. Lehn
Schigler, 3 volumes, 1925-31; De Vogels van Nederlandsch Indié, by H.
Schlegel, 3 parts in portfolio, 1863-66 ; The Voyage of Gregory Shelek-
hof, a Russian Merchant, from Okhotzk, on the Eastern Ocean, to the
Coast of America, in the Years 1783, 1784, 1785, 1786, 1787, and his

Resa, 1851-1853, under Befil af C. A. Virgin, by C. J. A. Skogman,
2 volumes in 1, 1854-55.

Gifts of the year came from 230 different donors and included
some of the most useful additions to the library. Reprints and
separates on special subjects from scientific and technical serials are
indispensable working tools of the different divisions of the Institu-
tion, and the gifts of Dr. Ray S. Bassler and of A. B. Gahan of their
personal collections of some 1,500 pamphlets each, on geology and
on Hymenoptera, respectively, were most appreciated additions to the
sectional libraries of geology and of insects. Paul Garber’s gift of
147 books and pamphlets on aeronautics greatly strengthened the h-
brary’s working collection of material in that field. As usual, the pub-
lications generously turned over by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science and by the American Association of Museums
supplied considerable material not received from other sources, and
furnished numbers of useful duplicates as well. The library is deeply
indebted to all its friends at home and abroad who have so kindly
made contributions to its collections.

The total number of publications recorded by the accessions di-
vision for the year was 62,137. Of these, 14,607 came through the
International Exchange Service, almost three times as many as in the
year before. With the gradual return to more nearly normal condi-
tions it is gratifying to find in how many cases the continuity of sets
of foreign serials published abroad during the war will not be broken
in the library because of the care with which they were reserved,
stored, and later shipped by the institutions with which we were in
regular exchange before the war. This encouraging aspect of the post-
war situation, however, does not mean that there are not, unavoidably,
a distressing number of series that ceased publication altogether dur-
ing the war, some of them probably never to be resumed.

The filling of gaps in serial sets, foreign and domestic, current and
old, requires eternal vigilance, and most of the 6,812 pieces received
in response to our 589 requests were numbers of periodicals needed to
fill such gaps, and were obtained chiefly in exchange. New exchanges
arranged were 290.
154 | ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

Of the current accessions, 7,265 were cataloged or entered as addi-
tions to the Smithsonian Deposit in the Library of Congress, and most
of these were additions to the great Deposit sets of publications of
scientific institutions and learned societies, so important to research.
Some of them were continuations of series that formed part of the
original Smithsonian Deposit in 1866. In addition, all documents,
dissertations, and other publications on subjects not found to be of
immediate interest to the Institution were sent directly upon receipt
to the Library of Congress, and they numbered 13,422.

Most but not all of the 10,749 publications transferred to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, the Army Medical Library, the Geological Sur-
vey, and other libraries of the Government, had been received during
the year.

Our large collection of duplicates continued to be drawn upon in
aid of destroyed libraries abroad, and 31,781 pieces were turned over
to the American Book Center for this purpose.

The cataloging of currently received material was well kept up on
the whole in spite of the handicaps of inadequate staffing of this
vitally important part of the library’s work. There is always the
problem of the huge “backlog” of poorly or completely uncataloged
older material, which is not only serious in itself but which inevitably
slows up some of the work of cataloging new material which is related
to it.

The bad housing of the library continues to be the most obvious
and distressing of its problems. The progressive deterioration of its
fine collections caused by overcrowding and lack of funds for binding
is deplorable, while the inadequacies of its reading and reference rooms,
the scattered and inconvenient locations of its shelves and stack rooms,
and the absence of proper work rooms for the staff, all make its
service to the Institution increasingly difficuit.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects of
art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whistler,
Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for the
construction of a building to house the collection, and finally in his
will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities to
the estimated value of $1,958,591.42, as an endowment fund for the
operation of the Gallery.

The above fund of Mr. Freer was almost entirely represented by
20,465 shares of stock in Parke, Davis & Co. As this stock advanced in
value, much of it was sold and the proceeds reinvested so that the fund
now amounts to $6,069,845.32 in a selected list of securities classified
later.

The invested funds of the Freer bequest are under the following

Sirs: Pursuant to agreement we have audited the accounts of the Smithsonian
Institution for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947, and certify the balances of cash
on hand, including petty cash fund, June 30, 1947, to be $904,356.19.

We have verified the records of receipts and disbursements maintained by
the Institution and the agreement of the book balances with the bank balances.

We have examined all the securities in the custody of the Institution and in
the custody of the banks and found them to agree with the book records.

We have compared the stated income of such securities with the receipts of
record and found them in agreement therewith.

We have examined all vouchers covering disbursements for account of the In-
stitution during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947, together with the authority
therefor, and have compared them with the Institution’s record of expenditures
and found them to agree.

We have examined and verified the accounts of the Institution with each trust
fund.

We found the books of account and records well and accurately kept and the
Securities conveniently filed and securely cared for.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 169

All information requested by your auditors was promptly and courteously

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1947

171
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Grnrrat Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1947.

LARGE SUNSPOTS?

By SerH B. NICHOLSON

[With 2 plates]

Nearly 16,000 groups of sunspots have been recorded since 1874
when the Greenwich Observatory began to catalog the spots observed
on daily photographs of the sun. These groups range in size from
small clusters of tiny spots a few hundred miles in diameter to huge
groups nearly 200,000 miles long, containing individual spots as large
as 80,000 miles across. Many spots are seen for only a day or two
before they disappear, some develop to moderate size, a few grow
into groups large enough to be seen without a telescope, and a very few
into huge groups like the one which was visible from March 30 to
April 18, 1947.

The area of every group is given for each day in the Greenwich
records, the unit of area being one-millionth of a solar hemisphere,
or 1,174,000 square miles. Of the 16,000 groups observed since 1874,
only 27, less than one-fifth of 1 percent, attained areas as great as
2,500 millionths of a solar hemisphere (about 3,000 million square
miles). These 27 groups are listed in table 1, with their maximum
areas as measured by the Greenwich Observatory or the United States
Naval Observatory. The areas are given to only two figures because
the irregular outline of a spot seldom permits greater accuracy.
Measures by different observers of several of the groups listed differ
by as much as 15 percent. Of the spots recorded before 1874, three
at least were large enough to have been included in the table. One
of these appeared in August 1859, at heliographic latitude 20° N.; the
second in July 1860, at 26° N.; and the third in August 1860, at 24° S.
All the groups listed in table 1 were conspicuous objects with the un-
aided eye, if the sun was dimmed sufficiently by fog, smoke, or dark
glasses.

ne peenths of a solar hemisphere. To express the area in million square miles increase these figures
* The large group in April 1947 was probably identical with the one in March, both being in the same
region on the sun. They have been considered as one group in this article.

The great spot group of April 1947, which was the largest ever
recorded, developed from some small spots first seen on February 5,
1947, at the east limb of the sun in latitude 23° S. These spots grew
rapidly until by February 7 they formed a group large enough to be
seen without a telescope. When, after a solar rotation, the group
reappeared at the east limb on March 8, it had changed considerably,
being much larger and more compact than in February. In March
the group was composed primarily of one huge spot, which had appar-
ently developed from the preceding (western) members of the Febru-
ary group, the following members of which had disappeared. When
it reappeared on March 380 for its third transit, the huge group al-
though breaking up had increased in area. When largest it covered
more than 1 percent of the solar disk, its area being 6,300,000,000
square miles, 5,400-millionths of a solar hemisphere. On its fourth
and last return the group was much smaller. The preceding part,
which had always been the smaller, disappeared on May 7. The fol-
lowing part passed around the west limb on May 11 and did not return.

The large spot of March 1947 was the largest single spot on record
with an area of 5,000,000,000 square miles, 4,300-millionths of a solar
hemisphere. Before 1874, visual observers sometimes published the
over-all length and breadth of a group instead of its area. From this
data the area cannot be computed because the group may have been
composed of several unconnected spots. A long spot group observed
in September and October 1858 has been cited in several popular books
on astronomy as the largest group ever recorded. H. Schwabe, a
noted observer of sunspots, gave its east-west diameter as 32173,
which is equivalent to 143,000 miles or one-sixth of a solar diameter.
Someone, interpreting this figure as the diameter of a huge circular
spot, computed its area as one thirty-sixth that of the solar disk, or
14,000-millionths of a solar hemisphere. This figure has since been
LARGE SUNSPOTS-—-NICHOLSON 175

quoted in many books as the area of the largest group on record.
Actually that group was a long, narrow stream of spots with an area
less than 1,000-millionths of a hemisphere.

Plate 1 shows the great group of 1947 as it crossed the disk of the
sun in March and April. Plate 2 shows four other large spot groups,
all to the same scale. A spot group, composed of individual spots of
various sizes, is usually elongated in an east-west direction. Each
sunspot is composed of an irregular shaded area, sometimes nearly
circular, called the penumbra, which is cooler than the sun’s surface
(the photosphere). Inside the penumbra are smaller, darker areas
called umbrae. In large spots the umbrae cover about one-seventh of
the area of the spot. Even the umbrae are not black but only less
bright than the photosphere; the contrast between the photosphere and
the umbra of a spot is actually less than the reproductions of the photo-
graphs would indicate. The temperature of the photosphere is about
10,000° Fahrenheit, that of the penumbra about 9,000°, and that of the
umbra about 7,500°. Not all umbrae have the same temperature and
the largest are not always the darkest and coolest. The radiation from
the umbra of a large spot is between one-fourth and one-half that from
the photosphere, from the penumbra, between two-thirds and three-
fourths. In the large group of 1947, the area of all the umbrae was
about 700-milhonths of a solar hemisphere, that of the penumbrae
about 4,700. As seen projected these areas were, respectively, 0.13 and
0.90 of 1 percent of the solar disk. The total solar radiation was there-
fore reduced less than one-half of 1 percent by the presence of the
large spot group.

Every group listed in table 1 except those of October 1894 and Sep-
tember 1928, were observed for more than one solar rotation. Groups
which attain their maximum area while visible are generally formed
on the invisible side of the sun, and those born on the visible side are
generally carried out of view before their maximum area is reached.
Only 4 of the 27 largest groups were born on the visible half of the
sun. ‘Two of these, February 4, 1905, and February 12, 1907, died on
the visible hemisphere; their ages were 91 days and 98 days, respec-
tively. The group of February 1946 lasted more than 99 days; how
many more is not known because it developed and disappeared on the
invisible hemisphere. Smaller groups have been recorded which lasted
longer than any of these. Eleven of the twenty-seven groups in table 1
returned only once, nine came back twice, and five returned three times.

A sunspot is recorded to have been observed for 18 months in 184.0-41.
The original record of this group has not come to my attention, but it
is doubtful whether a spot or a group of spots ever retained its identity
for so longa time. Although the same region on the sun may remain
active for many months, the continuity of activity is usually due to a
succession of spot groups. Sunspots have a habit of reappearing in
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1947

the region where an old group has been, sometimes not even waiting
for the old group to disappear. ‘The group of January 24, 1926, may
have been a return of the group of December 29, 1925; certainly both
were in the same region of the sun. A small round spot closely follow-
ing the large group of January 1926 was probably identical with the
largest spot of the December 1925 group. The large spots of the
January group, however, behaved like new spots which had developed
near the waning members of the December group. The two groups
were therefore probably not actually identical. The groups of March
and April 1947 may not be identical but their relationship seems closer
than that between the groups of December 1925 and that of January
1926.

Large sunspots or, more precisely, the solar activity associated with
them, definitely affect the earth. The obvious direct terrestrial effects
are confined to the ionosphere, that high region of the atmosphere in
which electric currents can flow and from which radio waves are re-
flected. The most spectacular effects are brilhant auroras (northern
and southern lights). Closely associated with auroras are changes in
the electric currents in the ionosphere, which produce marked fluctua-
tions in the earth’s magnetic field (magnetic storms). These disturb-
ances can be so violent that long-distance telegraph lines and cables
are affected, making communications difficult or impossible. Other
terrestrial effects are produced simultaneously with very intense solar
“flares,” phenomena which nearly always appear in or near large spot
groups. Intense flares produce minor changes in the earth’s magnetic
field and also cause high-frequency radio waves to be absorbed so that
long-distance short-wave communication is impossible on the daytime
part of the earth while a flare is in progress. These effects are in all
probability due to an increase in ultraviolet radiation from the sun at
the time of the flare. Although the change in solar radiation due to
the presence of a large sunspot must affect the earth’s lower atmosphere,
and therefore the weather, such effects are very small and are difficult
to measure and interpret.
