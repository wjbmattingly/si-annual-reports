GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The United States National Museum had its origin in the act of
Congress of 1846 founding the Smithsonian Institution, which made
the formation of a museum one of the principal functions of the
latter, and provided that—

Whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their recep-
tion, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural
history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United
States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody they may
be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents
to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for
the Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and when-
ever new specimens in natural history, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the
museum of the Institution, by exchanges of duplicate specimens, which the Regents
may in their discretion make, or by donation, which they may receive, or otherwise,
the Regents shal! cause such new specimens to be appropriately classed and arranged.

The principal and accumulated interest of the Smithsonian fund
amounted at that time to about $750,000, a sum considered ample to
meet the needs of the various operations in which it was proposed that
the Smithsonian Institution should engage. In 1846 probably not
more than one or two universities or learned establishments in Amer-
ica had so large an endowment, and it was apparently the idea of
Congress that the fund was sufficient both for the erection of a build-
ing and for the care of the collections which would be turned over
to it or acquired by the national surveys, and in other ways. The
Museum thus began as an integral part of the Institution, coordinate
with its library, and was required by law to provide for the Govern-
ment collections which had previously accumulated, a duty which the

Institution did not see its way clear to fulfill until 1858, when Con-
eress began to make small yearly appropriations to aid in this purpose.
So inadequate, however, were the sums voted that for many years the
slender income of the Institution continued to be drawn upon to insure
the maintenance of what was then justly called the ‘Smithsonian
Museum, since the building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a
considerable portion of the collections was and still is the property of
the Institution, through exploration and gift, and a number of the offi-
cials connected with the Museum were employed at its expense.

The first scientific collection to come into the possession of the Insti-
tution—and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest—was the small but
‘aluable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who
was himself a chemist and mineralogist of repute and a Fellow of the
Royal Society of London. .

The nucleus of the National Museum was, however, virtually acquired
by the National Institute, a society organized in Washington about
1840, having for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson
bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that
foundation. One of these objects was the gathering of historical and
natural history specimens from both official and private sources, most
prominent among the former having been the United States Exploring
Expedition around the world from 1838 to 1842. Rooms in the Patent
Office building were secured for the museum of the society, which was
practically recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Goy-
ernment collections retained in Washington. . Another important serv-
ice rendered by the society was, as the late Dr. G. Brown Goode has
said, in the direction of educating public opinion ‘‘to consider the
establishment of such an institution worthy of the Government of the
United States.” Failing, however, to secure the public recognition at
which it aimed, it became inactive upon the establishment of the Smith-
sonian Institution in 1846, and its charter, which expired in 1861, was
not renewed. The Government collections in its possession, which
came practically under the care of the Commissioner of Patents, were
turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858. Other material
directly under the control of the National Institute remained at the
Patent Office until 1862, and a part of the historical objects were held
there until 1883.

Previous to 1858, however, important materials for a museum were
being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution, at its own cost and
through the activities of its assistant secretary, Prof. Spencer F.
Baird, beginning even before his appointment to that office in 1850.
The personal bent of Professor Baird was toward the collection of
natural history specimens for purposes of study. With the approval
of Secretary Henry he put into operation plans for the accomplish-
ment of this object, which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yield-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

ing regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird’s own vacations
were spent in field work. Officers of the Army and Navy and of other
branches of the Government service, fishermen, fur traders, private
explorers, and such powerful organizations as the Hudson’s Bay Com-
pany and the Western Union Telegraph Company, were enlisted in
the work and rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by
these beginnings has been lasting and widespread, as shown in the
extensive natural history operations of subsequent National and State
surveys, the organization of the Fish Commission and Bureau of Eth-
nology, and the support given to scientific collecting by many other
bureaus of the Government.

The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian
Institution, which devolved upon the first Board of Regents, led, in
January, 1847, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution
expressing approval of the museum feature as one of its important
functions:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress establishing the Institution,
and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that
one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of
collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the
gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to ail departments of
human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science,
literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learn-
ing among men, and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who
may devote themselves to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge. @

The policy thus announced has prevailed to the present day.

In 1879, when most of the existing Government surveys, whose
work included the collecting of specimens in the field, had been estab-
lished, Congress deemed it important to practically reenforce the pro-
visions of the act founding the Institution, in order that there might
be no doubt as to the proper disposition of the material certain to be
derived from these various sources, by the following enactment in the
sundry civil appropriation act for 1880:

All collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history,
archeology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological
Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no
longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the National
Museum.

Although the name ‘* National Museum” was sometimes used in the
earlier reportsof the Smithsonian Institution, it did not appear in any
of the laws of Congress until 1875. Its general employment may be
said to date from the time of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition
of 1876, the first exposition in this country in which the Government
participated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the
people of the United States the existence of national collections at

Washington, as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting
museum materials, differing radically from the older cabinets of col-
lege or local museums, which had prevailed up to that period: After

persons and foreign governments, rendered necessary the early eree

new and separate building, devoted entirely to museum
purposes. Since that time Congress has mainly provided for the
maintenance of the Museum, but its management remains, by the
fundamental act. under the authority of the Regents of the Smithso-
nian Institution, administered through their Secretary, who is ex officio
the keeper—a form of government insuring a consistent and uniform
policy and a nonpartisan administration of its affairs. The greater
part of the Smithsonian building is still used for museum purposes,
and the Institution, as well as most of the scientific bureaus at Wash-
ington, cooperate, both through men and material, in enlarging and

tion of a

‘aring for the national collections.

The scope of the National Museum as defined by law comprises
practically all branches of science and of the arts which admit of
museum treatment. With exceedingly limited means for, making pur-
chases, and therefore almost entirely dependent as to the character
of its collections upon Government explorations, personal donations,
and exchanges, its different departments have had a very unequal
growth. The subjects best represented are American ethnology and
archeology, geology, zoology, and botany. A fair beginning has been
made in the exceedingly important branches of the industrial arts
and American history, and scarcely more is required to place these
two departments on a proper basis than sufficient room to display
the necessary collections, which are certain to be received, in greater
part through gratuitous contributions, when it is known that the
Museum is prepared to care for them. In the department of the fine
arts the collection is still very small, but the subject is one which
must sooner or later receive earnest consideration by the Government.

The specimens in all branches are classified in two series; one, com-
prising the bulk of the material, being arranged for the purposes of
scientific research and reference in laboratories and storerooms, to
which students are freely admitted; the other, selected with regard to
their general educational yalue and public interest, and accompanied
by descriptive labels, being displayed in glass-covered cases in the
public halls. The duplicate specimens not required for exchanges
are made up into sets for distribution to schools and colleges, as
opportunity offers. Paper's descriptive of the collections, both tech-
nical and popular, are published for gratuitous circulation to the
extent of three or more volumes yearly, and, finally, the Museum
has come to be regarded as a bureau of information in respect to all
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7

subjects with which it is even in the remotest degree concerned, the
correspondence which this involves now constituting one of its heaviest
tasks.

The history of the Museum, as pointed out by the late Dr. Goode,
may be divided into three epochs, which he characterized as follows:

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, dur-
ing which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research.
No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except
as a foundation for scientific description and theory.

Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the
‘‘National Cabinet of Curiosities,’’? to 1876. During this period the Museum became
a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these col-
lections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable,
made to serve an educational purpose.

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has
undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting
them on account of their value from an educational standpoint.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in
the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research,
while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three
ideas—record, research, and education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they
are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum
endeavors to promote them all.

In the same connection, Dr. Goode also defined the scope and objects
of the Museum in the following concise manner:

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an
enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of numerous past investigations.
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for
the reports upon the resources of the United States.

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest
degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research
is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and
instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investi-
gators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians.

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every
kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its
publications and its named series of duplicates.

AS A MUSEUM OF RECORD.

In its function as a museum of record the growth of the National
Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration
and development of a rich and extensive country under the liberal
and progressive policy of the Government. From scientific institu-
tions throughout the world, from foreign governments, and from indi-
viduals abundant stores of great value have been received, either as
gifts or through the medium of exchange of specimens, and a small
appropriation in recent years has permitted of some purchases to
supply desiderata.
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized
as follows:

|. The explorations und
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in con-
nection with educational institutions or commercial establishments,
and the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward
the accumulation of natural history and anthropological material.

9, The United States Exploring Expedition around the world from
1838 to 1842, the North Pacific, or Perry, Exploring Expedition from
1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and
including the recent operations in the West Indian and Philippine

carried on more or less directly under the

waters.

2 The activities of members of the United States diplomatic and
consular service abroad.

4. The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad
surveys, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the surveys
carried on by the Engineer Corps of the U.S. Army; and the activi-
ties of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Army
stationed in remote regions.

5. The explorations of the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. 5. Fish
Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of American
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and other scientific branches
of the Government.

6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several exposi-
tions at home and abroad in which the Museum and Fish Commission
have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhibition
at Philadelphia in 1876, the International Fisheries Exhibitions at Berlin
in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial
Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the
World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and the expositions
at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, at Omaha in 1898, and at
the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The returns from the World’s
Fair in Philadelphia were of greatest extent, comprising, besides the
collections displayed by the United States in illustration of the animal
and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native
races of the country, valuable gifts from thirty of the foreign goy-
ernments which participated, as well as the industrial collections of
numerous manufacturing and commercial houses of Europe and
America.

7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums and with indi-
viduals.

Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when the
collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building,
the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was
about 235,000. In 1884, when the additional room afforded by the new
building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the large
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

accessions received from Philadelphia and from other sources, the
number had grown to 1,471,000. At the close of the year covered by
this report the total number of recorded specimens was 5,654,864.

While these figures convey no impression of the bulk of the collec-
tions, when it is considered that by 1885 all of the space in both build-
ings was completely filled, and in fact so overcrowded that a third
building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may
be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to
their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the speci-
mens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many years most
of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsafe
structures, where they are mainly piled up in the original packing
boxes, and where has already accumulated enough material of great
intrinsic and scientific value to fill an additional building as large as
that now occupied by the main collections.

AS A MUSEUM OF RESEARCH.

In order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in
the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the
extent of its accommodations, arranged systematically and in a manner
convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or study series, so
called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as complete
in all the groups as the accessions have made possible, is given to all
properly qualified persons engaged in original research. The oppor-
tunities thus afforded are widely availed of, the Museum being visited
every year by many investigators, some of world-wide distinction,
coming from the scientific centers of European and other foreign
countries, as well as from all parts of the United States. Material is
also occasionally sent out to representatives of other institutions
having the means of providing for its safe-keeping, when required in
the working up of special subjects, or for comparison in connection
with their own collections.

The custodianship of the collections being the first and most impera-
tive duty devolving upon the scientific staff of the National Museum,
its members find comparatively little time during office hours for
advancing knowledge, though they are mostly well qualified for such
work, being selected with special reference to their ability to identify
and classify the specimens under their charge in accordance with the
latest researches. As a matter of fact, however, the staff does pro-
duce every year a large number of papers descriptive of the collec-
tions, which together constitute an important contribution to scientific
literature.

Among the honorary officers having their laboratories at the Museum
are a number of assistants employed by other scientific bureaus to con-
duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose
results the Museum shares.
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the
Geological Survey, the Fish C ommission, the Department of Agricul-
ture. and other branches of the Government to the custody of the
Museum in advance of their final working up, in order to provide for
their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here
afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work car-
ried on in the Museum building has been greatly increased.

Though having little means to expend for field work, members of
the Museum staff are occasionally given opportunities to participate
in the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expedi-
tions. in connection with which special researches may be carried on,
though the chief advantage results from the acquisition of new aa

valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it
occurred in nature. Dy bas

AS AN EDUCATIONAL MUSEUM.

The educational side of the Museum is intended to consist mainly:
of an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so
mounted, installed, and labeled as to directly interest and instruct the
general uilte The principal difficulty incident to the proper instal-
lation of such a collection, conceding all the space required, lies in the
selection of its parts, so that while enough is displayed to convey the
amount of information which it is intended to impart, the visitor shall
not be overburdened or confused with details. While this policy is
being followed in the National Museum so far as its means permit,
the lack of room has always prevented a complete or satisfactory
development of the plan, and every succeeding year the conditions in
this respect gi0w worse instead of better through the increased crowd-
ing of the halls. The advances in recent years have been chiefly in
the methods of display, in the character of individual and group
mountings, and in the labeling, in all of which directions exceptional
progress has been made.

Two years ago it was announced that all of the halls designed for
public use were then for the first time permanently open, aioe none
were above addition or improyement, while in some the arrangement
was entirely provisional. This was only accomplished by the transfer
of large quantities of material to outside storage, but during the past
year it has unfortunately been again necessary to shut off one of the
most attractive halls in order to furnish increased space for work-
rooms.

In this connection it seems appropriate to refer to the work of
Doctor Goode, than whom no museum administrator ever had a better
understanding of the public needs. He labored earnestly and con-
sclentiously to make this a museum for as well as of the people, and
the plans now being carried out are, in all their essential features, of
his making. While the assistants might be relied upon to arrange and
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11

maintain the study series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, the
interests of the public always remained in his immediate charge. He
was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of
nature and the activities of mankind that by the very force of his sur-
roundings the visitor was bound to receive and carry with him some
definite impressions, some new bit of knowledge. Doctor Goode’s
labors in this field ranged from the planning of the general scheme to
the most minute details of case architecture and fittings. His official
connection with nearly all the important expositions of the past quar-
ter of a century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums
of Europe and the United States gave him exceptional opportunities
for observation and experiment. Though a young man when he died,
none other had acquired so ripe an experience and none is more worthy
of being followed.

An incidental though very popular educational feature of the
Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching
throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and col-
leges of its duplicate specimens, properly identified and labeled, and
put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented
this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources
of the Museum would admit of, but many hundreds of such sets have
already been given away.

Scarcely a year passes that some exposition, either at home or
abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through
this means its existence and aims are brought constantly and promi-
nently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one
another so closely and have required such extensive preparations as
to interfere greatly with the ordinary work of the Museum, but the
practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a fresh
series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one,
insures a substantial gain, as the collections are returned to Washing-
ton, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum
metheds known to the people of the United States and stimulating
the growth of museums in many quarters.

Though mainly technical and most useful to the investigator, the
publications of the Museum can be classed, in a general way, as
belonging to its educational side, being the medium through which
the nature and extent of its collections are made known. The Annual
Report, first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report
in 1884, and now in its twentieth volume, consists, besides the admin-
istrative part, mainly of semipopular papers on interesting portions of
the collections. The Proceedings and Bulletins are almost exclusively
technical, the shorter papers being assigned to the former and the
larger and more exhaustive works to the latter. Of the Proceedings
twenty-four complete volumes have been issued, and of the Bulletins
fifty-two numbers.
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

AN ADDITIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING.

For over two decades a few paragraphs in this report have been
annually devoted to an account of the crowded and unsafe condition
of the national collections, and the consequent impossibility of further
complying with the law for their proper classification, arrangement, and
eare. Fortunately these conditions are soon to be remedied through
the erection of an additional building, having a capacity far exceeding
that of the existing structures combined, with exhibition halls to the
extent of nearly 5 acres, and facilities for all kinds of museum work.

In the last report it was announced that Congress had authorized
the preparation of plans for this new building, which was to be con-
structed of brick and terra cotta at a limit of cost of $1,500,000, and
to occupy a site on the north side of the Mall opposite the Smith-
sonian Institution. Such a building, though large enough to relieve
the immediate demands for additional space, would provide very
inadequately for the growth of the collections, and the material named
for the fronts was not considered entirely suitable for a structure of
the character proposed. Nearly a year was occupied in examining
into the requirements of the collections and in studying the principal
features of other museums. During the winter of 1902-3, a series
of tentative plans was prepared, and accompanied by a supplementary
report by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was submitted
to a special committee consisting of the Congressional Regents, ** to
represent to Congress the pressing needs of additional room for the
proper exhibition of specimens belonging to the National Museum.”
On January 23, 1903, the same papers were transmitted to Congress
and printed as Document 314 of the House of Representatives.

The plans provided for a large rectangular building, four stories
high including the basement, which was to be in all essential features
the equivalent of a story, well lighted and entirely serviceable for
museum purposes. The cost of the whole building, constructed of
brick and terra cotta, was estimated at $3,000,000, but one-half of the
structure, in symmetrical form, could be built for $1,500,000, thus
meeting the requirements of the act of 1902. The special committee
of the Regents above mentioned adopted the report of the Secretary,
though urging the larger building, in the following resolution:

That under the limitations of the law the committee hereby report to Congress Plan
B for a new National Museum building as the best obtainable for the amount men-
tioned; but, in the judgment of the committee, the larger plan, A, is believed to be
the one which should be adopted, and we therefore ask that Congress shall make

the appropriation for it instead of for the smaller plan.

Hearings followed before the Committees on Appropriations of
both the House and Senate, and a plea was made for the use of granite
instead of brick and terra cotta. The House took no action, but a bill
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

for the erection of the entire building in granite, at a limiting cost of
$3,500,000, was adopted by the Senate, and the measure in this shape
was finally agreed to in conference between the committees of the two
Houses. The bill as passed, being an item in the sundry civil act for
1904, was as fellows:

Building for National Museum: To enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion to commence the erection of a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts, for
the use of the National Museum, to be erected on the north side of the Mall, between
Ninth and Twelfth streets, northwest, substantially in accordance with the Plan A,
prepared and submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
under the provisions of the act approved June twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred and
two, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Said building complete, including
heating and ventilating apparatus and elevators, shall cost not to exceed three mil-
lion five hundred thousand dollars, and a contract or contracts for its completion is
hereby authorized to be entered into subject to appropriations to be made by Con-
gress. The construction shall be in charge of Bernard R. Green, Superintendent of
Buildings and Grounds, Library of Congress, who shall make the contracts herein
authorized and disburse all appropriations made for the work, and shall receive as
full compensation for his services hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annually
in addition to his present salary, to be paid out of said appropriations.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents held on March 12, 1903, a
committee to represent the Board in connection with the work of con-
struction was designated by resolution as follows:

That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the Chancellor and the chair-
man of the executive committee, be authorized to represent the Board of Regents so
far as may be necessary in consultation with Bernard R. Green, to whom the con-

struction and contracts for the new Museum building are committed by Congress in
the act making an appropriation for that purpose.

Messrs. Hornblower & Marshall, of Washington, who made the ten-
tative plans, were selected as architects and before the close of the
fiscal year their part of the work was well under way. It is expected
that about four or five years will be required for the construction of
the building.

SUMMARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE YEAR.

APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES.

The Congressional appropriations for the maintenance of the National
Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903, amounted to
$281,400, a decrease of $8,000 as compared with the previous year, the
changes being as follows: The bill for 1902 contained three specific
appropriations, one of $5,000 for the construction of two galleries, one
of $5,000 for electrical installation, and one of $12,500 for new boilers,
while the appropriations for 1903 comprised a new item of $7,000 for
preparing and printing the Contributions from the U. 5. National
Herbarium, heretofore published by the Department of Agriculture,
$5,000 for the preparation of plans for an additional Museum building,
and an increase of $2,500 in the appropriation for furniture and
fixtures.

The following tables show the expenditures during the year 1902-3
under each item of the appropriations for the past two years:

BUILDINGS.

At its last session, ending March 4, 1903, Congress authorized, in
the sundry civil act for 1903-4, the construction of an additional fire-
proof building of granite for the National Museum, at a cost not to
exceed $3,500,000, and appropriated $250,000 for the requirements of
the first year. The preparation of the final plans was begun near
the close of the fiscal year, and the work will be pushed as rapidly as
possible.

The roofs on the several sections of the Museum building have con-
tinued to give trouble, as new leaks develop during every heavy rain
and snow storm. This is more especially the case with the slate coy-
erings over the main halls, but the tin roofs are also in bad condition
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a larg

and both demand constant attention and repair, at some expense.
Before many years a new roof will become absolutely necessary, but
in the meantime it is proposed, should the regular appropriations suf-
fice for the purpose, to gradually replace the slate coverings with bet-
ter material, as only in this manner can the more pressing difficulties
be even temporarily overcome.

The leaks which have occurred through many years, and the fre-
quent repairs to walls and ceilings, had so defaced the interior of the
greater part of the Museum building as to render it unsightly in the
extreme. At the beginning of the fiscal year it was decided to remedy
these conditions so far as possible by painting those parts of the build-
ing which required it, in accordance with a simple but artistic scheme
of color. The rotunda and main halls were first completed, and next
three of the courts, leaving only one of the latter to be done during
the current year. The ranges do not call for any changes in this
respect at present. With this improvement the building has now
been placed in a far more presentable condition than ever before.

Another improvement in the Museum building has been the arrange-
ment of inner screen doors at the eastern or freight entrance, so as to
close off from the public or exhibition halls the vestibule in which
packages are received. Some of the rooms over this same entrance,
used by the Division of Plants, have also been modified and enlarged.

The archeological hall in the Smithsonian building has been closed
to the public during nearly the entire year. In September, 1902, so
many large pieces of plaster fell from the ceiling that its condition was
declared unsafe, and though all of the loose plaster was subsequently
removed, yet the appearance of the hall does not justify its reopening
at present. It is expected, however, to make such temporary repairs
before the close of another year as will permit of its being again made
accessible.

ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

The number of accessions or separate lots of material received dur-
ing the year was 1,648, being 234 more than in 1902. They comprised
about 236,580 specimens of all kinds, bringing the total number of
specimens in the several departments of the Museum up to about
5,654,864. There were also received for identification 886 lots of speci-
mens, the most of which were returned to the senders with the infor-
mation requested.

The most constant and important sources of material are the national
surveys and explorations, whose collections are, by law, transferred
to the custody of the Museum as soon as the necessary studies upon
them have been completed. The bureaus which figure most promi-
nently in this work are the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission,
the Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Insects and Plants of the

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology of
the Smithsonian Institution, though valuable contributions are occa-
sionally obtained from other branches of the Government service, and
officers of the Army and Navy stationed in the new possessions have,
in their individual capacity, been rendering much assistance. A very
large share of the additions to the collections is, however, received
from private individuals and establishments through donation and
exchange, and the exhibition series derives many of its attractive
features from loans or deposits. Field collecting by members of. the
Museum staff is almost prohibited by the lack of funds, and the acqui-
sition of specimens by purchase is seriously restricted because of the
small amount appropriated for that purpose.

A complete list of the accessions for the year is given in Appendix
Il, and the important ones are described in the reports of the head
curators. Only some of the more noteworthy ones will, therefore, be
referred to in this connection.

The total number of specimens added in the Department of Anthro-
pology was 24,319, of which 16,181 specimens belonged in the Division
of Prehistoric Archeology, 4,547 in Ethnology, and 1,502 each in
History and the Graphic Arts. One of the most valuable acquisitions
consisted of material recently collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott in
Sumatra and the Straits Settlements, and illustrated the native arts
and industries of a region but poorly represented in American museums.
The many objects, numbering over 1,500, secured in the Philippine
Islands by the late Col. F. F. Hilder, of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, for the Government exhibit at the Pan-American Exposi-
tion, have been turned over to the Museum by the Government Board.
This collection is of especial interest in that it furnishes much author-
itative information regarding the life and customs of the natives of
the largest of our new possessions. Dr. Frank Russell, formerly of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, secured important material from
the Pima Indians of southern Arizona, which, together with many
ethnological objects from other sources, have been transferred by the
Bureau to the custody of the Museum. Several collections made by
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, of the United States Navy, illustrating the arts
of the Chilcat and other Alaskan tribes, have also been acquired.

An extremely noteworthy collection deposited in the Museum by
Mr. 5. 5. Howland, of Washington, D. C., consists of objects repre-
senting Buddhist religious art, such as bronze and wooden images of
Buddha and Buddhist saints, shrines, temple lamps, and sacred writ-
ings on palm leaves, and also of several oriental manuscripts in
Hebrew, Arabic, and other languages. Miss Eliza R. Scidmore, of
Washington, also deposited a number of examples of Buddhist and
Hindu religious art. Twenty-eight Jewish ceremonial objects from
North Africa were obtained from Mr. Kphraim Deinard, of Kearney,
New Jersey, one of the most interesting pieces being an ark of carved
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

wood, containing a parchment scroll of the Pentateuch. The Egyp-
tian exploration fund has presented some valuable Greco-Egyptian
papyri.

Among the accessions in the Division of Prehistoric Archeology
were a collection of implements and other objects obtained by Mr.
W. H. Holmes from near Kimmswick, Missouri, with the assistance
of Mr. Gerard Fowke, who also transmitted a number of hammer-
stones, flint nodules, and other objects from ancient quarries near
Carter, Kentucky, and a series of implements and specimens of ore,
which had been mined for use as paint, from aboriginal mines at
Leslie, Missouri, collected by Mr. Holmes. About 3,000 specimens of
stone implements, gathered by the late Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing,
including spearheads, arrowpoints, harpoons, and tools of various
kinds, and a very important collection made by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes
in Porto Rico and Santo Domingo were received from the Bureau of
American Ethnology. The material from Santo Domingo comprises
many types new to the Museum, while that from Porto Rico contains
several stone rings or collars, sculptured pillow stones, the remains of
human skeletons, and various other objects.

A collection of stone implements of various types, pottery, bowls,
vases, etc., chiefly from the Mississippi Valley and the Pueblo region,
was obtained from Mr. E. O. Matthews, of Parral, Mexico, and many
objects illustrative of the stone age in Uruguay were received in
exchange from the Museo Nacional at Montevideo, through the cour-
tesy of Seftor Luis A. de Herrera, secretary of the Uruguayan lega-
tion at Washington. Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr, of London, England,
presented a series of paleolithic quartzite implements selected from a
collection made by him in the Lateritic deposits near Madras, India.

A series of models of United States war vessels, including gunboats,
monitors, protected cruisers, and rams, deposited in the Museum by
the Navy Department, forms a very attractive exhibit, being of espe-
cial interest to the public. The War Department has also deposited a
large number of models of heavy seacoast cannon, mountain howitzers,
and other types of ordnance formerly used by the Army, and examples
of small arms.

Many relics of General and Mrs. U. S. Grant, of great intrinsic as
well as historic value, have been presented to the Museum by their
children, through Brig. Gen. Frederick D. Grant, U. S. Army.
They include clothing worn by General Grant during the civil war,
commissions to different ranks in the Army, a cabinet present to Mrs.
Grant by the Empress of Japan, said to be one thousand years old
and valued at $20,000; several Japanese vases presented by the
Emperor of Japan, a lady’s toilet set in gold from the King and Queen
of Siam, and numerous other objects.

Eight hundred and thirty-seven gold, silver, and copper coins were
donated to the Museum by Mr. E, M, Chapman, of New York City.
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Casts of the Neanderthal and Prague ancient crania were purchased
for the newly established Division of Physical Anthropology, which
has also secured five valuable head-hunter’s skulls from New Guinea,
and a large series of crania and parts of human skeletons from the
Army Medical Museum, the U. S. Fish Commission, and other sources.

The Department of Biology received about 110,000 specimens, of
which approximately one-third were botanical. In zoology the Division
of Insects led with 37,684 specimens, followed by marine invertebrates
with 12,471 specimens, mammals with 7,485 specimens, mollusks with
6,332 specimens, and birds with 3,800 specimens.

The zoological specimens contributed by Dr. W. L. Abbott con-
sisted of a large number of deer, squirrels, porcupines, and a new
ape, collected in Sumatra and on the adjacent islands, and in the Riou
Linga Archipelago, south of Singapore. Many of the species are new
to science. The donations made by Doctor Abbott, as the result of his
recent extensive explorations in the East Indies, now comprise about
9.500 mammals and nearly 4,000 birds, besides several thousand speci-
mens in other branches of natural history.

Large collections of bird skins and eggs, fishes, corals, mollusks,
crustaceans, and other marine invertebrates, obtained during the
expedition of the U. 8. Fish Commission steamer A/batross to the
Hawaiian Islands and to Samoa, have been transmitted to the Museum
and will be referred to more in detail in the next report. They
include interesting series of the birds of the Laysan Islands.

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, presented a quantity of mammals
from the Yellowstone National Park and from Fort Snelling, Minne-
sota, and the Hon. B. S. Rairden, United States consul at Batavia,
two undescribed species of Zragulus from Jaya. An important collec-
tion of bats was obtained from Mr. William Foster, of Sapucay,
Paraguay; and one of bats and rodents from Mr. T. Tsuchida, of
Misaki, Japan. <A valuable skeleton of the porpoise, /’seudorca
crassidens, from the Hawaiian Islands, the first reported from that
region, was contributed by Prof. C. H. Gilbert, of the Leland Stan-
ford Junior University.

Several rare birds of paradise and other valuable specimens, includ-
ing a pair of flightless cormorants, from the Galapagos Islands, were
received from Mr. A. Boucard, Isle of Wight, England, and a Javan
jungle fowl, a black-winged peacock, and other birds from Mr. Homer
Davenport, Morris Plains, New Jersey. The Bishop Museum, of
Honolulu, presented about 40 bird skins, including several species not
previously represented in the Museum collection, and 295 interesting
specimens from Chiriqui, Costa Rica, including a number of cotypes,
and 52 bird skins from Honduras were obtained from Mr. Outram
Bangs, of Boston, partly as a gift and partly in exchange. The most

Eighteen snakes from the island of Cyprus were purchased from
Giacomo Cecconi, of Florence, Italy, and 29 snakes from Jamaica and
Michigan were donated by Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College,
Michigan.

The accessions to the collection of fishes were numerous and impor-
tant. Dr. O. P. Jenkins, of Leland Stanford Junior University,
donated 42 types of Hawaiian fishes, constituting a second installment

of a series of types the first of which were transmitted in 1901. A
valuable collection of types and cotypes of Japanese fishes was received
from Dr. David S. Jordan, president of the same university. A large
salmon, weighing about 50 pounds, taken at Cascapedia, Canada, was
presented by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia. A deep-sea
pelican fish, captured at a depth of between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms,
during the survey for the Pacific cable, was transmitted by the officers
of the U. 8. 8S. Wero, and a large conger eel was received from Mr.
Louis Mowbray, of Bermuda, through the New York Aquarium.

Besides the mollusks obtained by the Fish Commission expedition to

donations during the past year, transmitting a series of plants from
the West Indies and Central America.

The collections in the Department of Geology were increased by
about 102,000 specimens, of which 97,000 were fossil invertebrates.
As in past years, the principal accessions were from the U. S.
Geological Survey. Among the more important ones were a series of
minerals, rocks, and ores, constituting a portion of the exhibit made
by the Survey at the expositions recently held in Buffalo and Charles-
ton, and a collection of rocks from Arizona, California, Idaho, Colo-
rado, Oregon, and Washington. An interesting lot of tourmalinitic
quartz from Little Pipestone district, Montana, of which some of the
specimens are covered on one side with parallel layers of amethysts of
different hues, accompanied the former.

A valuable series of massive and cut polished stalactites and stalag-
mites from the Copper Queen mine was presented by Mr. James
Douglas, of Bisbee, Arizona. Interesting examples of volcanic bombs
and lavas from Cinder Buttes, Idaho, were received from Prof. I. C.

A small piece of the only known specimen of footeite was donated
by Mr. Warren M. Foote, of Philadelphia, and many very desirable
minerals, some of which were not previously represented in the
Museum collection, were obtained from different sources.

The largest and most valuable addition to the Division of Strati-
graphic Paleontology was the second installment of the E. O. Ulrich
collection of Paleozoic bryozoans, comprising about 75,000 specimens
and 2,500 microscopic slides. The collection as a whole is the most
extensive of its kind in existence and contains many unique specimens.
About 14,000 corals, crinoids, mollusks, and other fossil invertebrates
from the Mississippi Valley Paleozoic were received from Dr. Carl
Rominger, of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many of these have been figured
and described in the reports of the Geological Survey of Michigan.
The Andrew Sherwood collection of Pennsylvania Upper Devonic
vertebrate and invertebrate fossils is also entitled to special notice.
It was brought together by Mr. Sherwood, and includes many choice
slabs filled with large brachiopods and mollusks, besides about 38,000

EXPLORATIONS.

Fewer explorations than usual were carried on last year directly by
the Museum, owing to insufficient means for that purpose. Field work
under the Bureau of American Ethnology, which yielded interesting
collections of objects, since deposited in the Museum, as before men-
tioned, was conducted by Mr. William H. Holmes, Mr. Gerard Fowke,
and Dr. J. Walter Fewkes. Mr. Holmes visited the aboriginal hema-
tite mines at Leslie, Missouri, and Doctor Fewkes an ancient quarry
in Carter County, Kentucky, while Doctor Fewkes also spent consider-
able time in Santo Domingo and Porto Rico.

The important explorations of Dr. William L. Abbott in Sumatra
and the adjoining islands, as well as on the mainland of the Straits
26 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Settlements, have already been referred to under the heading of
‘© \ dditions to the Collections.” These explorations, which are carried
on entirely at the expense of Doctor Abbott, have now been in prog-

ress for several years, and through his onerocitn the National Museum
has been the fortunate recipient of the very large and extremely valu-
able collections that he has made.

In the spring of 1903 Mr. F. A. Lucas, accompanied by Mr. William
Palmer and Mr. J. W. Scollick, all of the Museum staff, visited one of
the stations of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company on the coast of
Newfoundland in the interest of the St. Louis Exposition for the pur-
pose of securing as complete a representation as possible of a large
sulphur-bottom whale. He was entirely successful, returning with a
perfect skeleton of a specimen measuring about 78 feet long, and with
molds of the exterior, from which a cast of the entire animal will be
made. These specimens at the close of the exposition will be exhib-
ited in the Museum.

Through the courtesy of the Geographical Society of Baltimore, the
Museum was enabled to send Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley with
an expedition to the Bahama Islands, where they were to make collec-
tion of the fishes and land animals of that region. The party was still
absent at the close of the year.

Dr. H. G. Dyar, with Mr. Rolla P. Currie, of the National Museum,
and Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, accom-
panied an expedition to British Columbia under the auspices of the
Carnegie Institution, and it is expected that they will bring back a
large and important collection of insects.

Mr. S. Ward Loper, of the U. S. Geological Survey, made for the
Museum an interesting collection of Triassic plants in Connecticut and
Massachusetts, and through arrangements with the Director of the
Survey, Hon. Charles D. Walcott, Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the
Museum staff, spent several weeks in Virginia and Georgia with
the special view of determining the geological horizons ofthe southern
part of the Appalachians. Incidental to this study he collected many
fossils. Several weeks were spent by Mr. R. S. Bassler in Ohio,
Indiana, and Kentucky collecting invertebrate fossils. A small collec-
tion of natural history specimens, obtained about Franz Josef Land
by the Baldwin-Ziegler expedition of 1902 to the Polar regions, was
presented to the Mieseara by Mr. William Ziegler. It is hoped that
the second expedition, now in progress under he same auspices, will

result in additional accessions from that little-known region.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIMENS.

The number of specimens furnished to specialists outside of the
Museum for study was 12,529, almost twice as many as during the
previous year, while the sets of duplicates distributed to educational
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 27

establishments in this country, together with those used in making
exchanges with individuals and institutions both at home and abroad,
comprised 33,228 specimens. The educational series consisted of
marine invertebrates, fishes, and geological material illustrating the
results of rock weathering and soil formation.

The following table shows the number of lots of specimens of all
kinds sent to each State and foreign country:

RESEARCHES.

Under the act of Congress founding the Smithsonian Institution the
Museum staff is charged with the classification and arrangement as well
as with the care and preservation of the national collections, and
although many of the accessions have been previously worked up, the
greater number reach the Museum unstudied and unnamed.

In selecting the assistants in every grade, therefore, it has been
necessary from the beginning to consider their qualifications with
reference to expert knowledge of the groups of specimens to be placed
under their charge, and in this manner a very effective though small
staff of paid scientific workers has been assembled. The greater part
of the time of these assistants has, naturally, to be given to the routine
duties attendant upon the receipt, assorting, labeling, cataloguing, and
disposition of the collection as received, but by working outside the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29

official hours, a characteristic of every zealous man of science, they
are to be credited every year with important progress in classification
and in other studies. Besides the paid assistants, however, there are
nearly as many volunteer or honorary members of the scientific staff,
filling positions for which the appropriations are insufficient to make
provision, and from these also extensive results in the elaboration of
collections are obtained. But notwithstanding these facts the Museum
depends to a large extent, for the study of its collections, on the
cooperation of scientific men belonging to other institutions, their
work being done gratuitously, and frequent calls are made upon its
resources to aid in researches conducted under other auspices.

In the Department of Anthropology, Prof. O. T. Mason, the Acting
Head Curator, was mainly occupied in completing his revised paper
on aboriginal basketry which is to appear as an appendix to the
Annual Report for 1902. Dr. A. Hrdlicka, Assistant Curator of
Physical Anthropology, made a study of the Lansing skeleton, includ-
ing an examination of other material. A description of the Parsee
creed and ceremonials represented in the collections of the Museum
was prepared by Dr. I. M. Casanowicz and published in the American
Anthropologist. Dr. Cyrus Adler and Dr. Casanowicz continued their
work on a bibliography of Assyriology.

Among the investigators from other places who were given facilities
for making studies on anthropological subjects were M. Pittier, head
of the National Museum of Costa Rica; Dr. Carl von den Steinen, of
Berlin; Dr. Hjalmar Stolpe, director of the Royal Museum of Sweden
at Stockholm; Prof. Hartmann, of Stockholm; Dr. A. B. Hunter of
Raleigh, N. C.; Dr. E. A. Bogue, of New York City; and Dr. Walde-
mar Bogoras, of the American Museum of Natural History. Doctor
Bogoras’s visit was made in the interest of his explorations among the
tribes of northeastern Siberia and for the purpose of ascertaining
whether any material of Siberian origin was contained in the extensive
Eskimo collection of this Museum.

In the Department of Biology Mr. G. 8S. Miller, jr., Assistant Cura-
tor of Mammals, gave special attention to the working up of Doctor
Abbott’s collections of East Indian mammals, in which he has already
discovered 17 new species of mouse deer (genus Zragulus), 16 new
species belonging to other orders, and one new genus (Lenothrix).
In the Museum collection of American bats, he has found 20 unde-
scribed species, diagnoses of which have been published in the pro-
ceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He has
also prepared notes on a number of species of bats and rodents. Dr.
EK. A. Mearns, U. 8. Army, made a study of the ocelots, the results of
which were printed in the Museum Proceedings. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr..
has completed a list of the tvpe specimens of mammals, exclusive of
cetaceans, in the collections of the Museum, which number 469 species
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

and subspecies. Photographs of the types are still to be prepared.
Doctor Lyon has also pursued investigations on the osteology of the
rabbits, and has published two brief notes on other mammals. The
head curator of biology, Dr. Frederick W. True, completed an enten-
sive and important monograph on the North American and European
species of whalebone whales, his manuscript being submitted for pub-
lication toward the close of the year. He also prepared papers on
Doctor Philippi’s species of Chilean porpoises, on a killer whale
stranded on the coast of Maine, and on a species of Prodelphinus
obtained at Honolulu; and notes on the name of the common porpoise
of the genus 7urséops, and on the occurence of the pollack whale,
Balaenoptera borealis, in American waters.

The second volume of Mr. Robert Ridgway’s manual of North and
Central American birds, containing 854 pages of text and 22 plates,
was issued during the year. It deals with the families of Tanagers,
Troupials, Honey Creepers and Wood Warblers (Tanagride, Icteridee,
Coerebidee and Mniotiltide), comprising 77 genera and 433 species
and subspecies. The preparation of the third volume, covering 15
families, is well advanced, about 400 pages being now in type. A
paper by Dr. Charles W. Richmond on the birds collected by Doctor
Abbott and Mr. C. B. Kloss, in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has
been published, and Doctor Richmond has also spent much time in
working up the Abbott collection of birds from the west coast of
Sumatra, and a collection from the South Pacific. He has likewise
made considerable progress with the card catalogue of the genera and
species of birds. Dr. William L. Ralph continued the preparation of
material for a volume on the life-histories of North American birds
with special reference to their nests and eggs, supplemental to the
unfinished work of the late Major C. E. Bendire, U. S. Army.

Dr. Leonhard Stejneger completed his report on the reptiles of
Porto Rico and has been engaged in the investigation of the reptile
fauna of Eastern Asia. Papers by Doctor Stejneger on Holbrook’s
salamander and on the reptiles of the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona,
were published by the Museum during the year.

In connection with an extensive work on the Tertiary mollusks
of Florida, Dr. W. H. Dall prepared reviews of the recent species of
Veneridx, Carditacea, Cyrenacea, and Astartide. Mr. Bartsch con-
tinued his studies on the Pyramidellidee, which were nearly finished at
the close of the year.

Dr. W. H. Ashmead continued his work upon the classification of
the Chaleid-flies, which is now in course of printing by the Carnegie
Museum, and published several papers on the wasps of the groups
Vespoidea, Proctotrypoidea, and Cynipoidea. He had also in course
of preparation monographs on the North American Braconide and the
Japanese Hymenoptera, and a catalogue of North American Hyme-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31

noptera. Mr. D. W. Coquillett was occupied in identifying and arrang-
ing the Diptera and completed a revision of the genera of the family
Empidide. A paper by him descriptive of 4 new genera and 94 new
species of North American diptera was printed in the Proceedings.
Mr. Nathan Banks published 16 papers on spiders and other entomo-
logical subjects. A paper on dragon-flies and one on ant-lions, by
Mr. Rolla P. Currie, were published by the Entomological Society of
Washington. Mr. Currie continued work on a catalogue of North
American Neuropteroid insects, and on a monograph of the ant-lions.
Mr. August Busck published two papers on the codling-moth and one
on a new species of the family Yponomentide, and also a revision of
the American moths of the family Gelechiidee. The Museum Proceed-
ings for the year contained a paper by Dr. H. G. Dyar on the larvee
of moths from Colorado, and an additional section of Dr. John G.
Smith’s monograph of the moths of the family Noctuide.

The researches by Dr. J. E. Benedict included a revision of the
genus Lepidopa, descriptions of new Galatheide, Albuneide, and
Dromide, and studies upon the Anomuran crabs collected in Japanese
and Hawaiian waters by the Fish Commission steamer Albatross, and
upon several interesting annelids. Miss M. J. Rathbun continued
work on a monograph of the fresh-water crabs based on the collec-
tions of the U. 8S. National Museum, the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle,
Paris, the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University,
and other institutions. She also prepared five short papers on
crustaceans which were printed during the year.

Miss Harriet Richardson completed reports on the Isopod crustace-
ans collected in Hawaii and Japan by the Fish Commission steamer
Albatross, and in Japan by the U.S. 8. Palos in 1881, and by Dr.
D. 8. Jordan and J. O. Snyder in 1900, and also on some cymothoids
collected by Dr. C. H. Gilbert on the west coast of Central America,
and on the American Epicaridea in the U. 5. National Museum.

Dr. C. W. Stiles, Custodian of the helminthological collections,
made an extended investigation of a parasitic disease prevalent among
the people of the Southern States, which he found to be due to the
attacks of an undescribed species of hook-worm, Uneinaria americana,
and carried on inquiries regarding the frequency of the occurrence of
parasites inmen. He published twelve papers during the year relat-
ing to parasitology, three of these having been prepared conjointly
with Dr. Albert Hassall and Mr. Charles A. Pfender; and also the
first three parts of an index-catalogue of medical and veterinary
zoology, with Doctor Hassall as coauthor.

In the Division of Plants, an unusual amount of routine work, espe-
cially in connection with the rearrangement of the collections, pre-
vented the accomplishment of much scientific research. A third
section of Dr. J. N. Rose’s studies of Mexican and Central American
plants. and a paper by the same author in conjunction with Mr.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

W. B. Hemsley on the genus /uléania were printed. Doctor Rose also
continued work on the Crassulacese of North America conjointly with
Doctor Britton, and completed a preliminary paper relating to that
group of plants. Mr. C. L. Pollard contributed a number of notes
to the Plant World, and described two new violets from the United
States. With Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell he also published descriptions
of four new plants from New Mexico. Mr. W. R. Maxon continued
his studies on the Museum ccllection of ferns, and Mr. Edward S.
Steele completed a monograph on a section of the genus Laciniarca.

Access to the collections in biology were accorded during the year
to a considerable number of visiting naturalists. The meetings of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Society
of American Naturalists, and other affiliated societies during convoca-
tion week brought together in Washington many prominent investi-
gators, and itis their time was limited, some of them took advantage
of the opportunity to examine specimens in the line of their specialty.
The committee on nomenclature of the American Ornithologists’ Union
during its meeting from April 16 to 18 made extensive use of the
bird collection in determining the status of North American species.
Among individual ornithologists to whom the same privilege was
given were Prof. W. W. Cooke, Mr. E. W. Nelson, Mr. H. C. Ober-
holser, and Mr. W. H. Osgood, of the Department of Agriculture;
Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston; Dr. J. Dwight, jr., of New York City;
and Mrs. Florence Merriam Bailey, of Washington.

Mr. Thomas Barber, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was here for
some time studying the Old World chameleons, which he proposes to
monograph. Among students of entomology who conducted work
at the Museum were Dr. W. J. Holland, Director of the Carnegie
Museum, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Prof. John B. Smith, of Rutgers
College, New Brunswick, New Jersey; Dr. James A. G. Rehn and Mr.
J. Chester Bradley, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Mr. H. H. Ballou,
of Amherst, Massachusetts, and Dr. Walter Horn, of Berlin, Germany.

Prof. W. P. Hay, of Howard University, Washington, continued
his studies upon crayfishes and other fresh-water crustaceans, and
completed descriptions of the species collected by himself at Mam-
moth Cave, Kentucky, and Nickajack Cave, Tennessee, and by Dr.
C. H. Eigenmann in Cuba. Prof. G. I. Hamaker, of Trinity College,
Durham, North Carolina, examined the specimens of Cerianthus; Miss
Katherine J. Bush, of the Peabody Museum of Yale University, cer-
tain type specimens of Annelids, and Dr. S. J. Holmes, of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, certain species of Amphipod crustaceans.

The principal visiting botanists have been Dr. N. L. Britton, Direc-
tor of the New York Botanical Garden; Dr. L. M. Underoom of
Columbia University, New York City; Mr. Theodor Holm, of Breer

land, District of Columbia: and Dr. E. L. Greene, of ae Catholic
University, Washington.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33

The herbarium has also been constantly utilized by the botanists of
the Department of Agriculture.

A large amount of material from the Department of Biology was
lent to specialists for study or sent to them for working up in the
interest of the National Museum. The Biological Survey of the
Department of Agriculture had the use of many specimens of mam-
mals, and specimens of the same group were sent out of the city as
follows:

To Mr. James A. G. Rehn, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, 41 specimens of several groups for use in his report on
terrestrial vertebrates collected in portions of southern New Mexico
and western Texas, besides 14 specimens of Vyctinomus,; to Mr. D. G.
Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, 35 specimens for use in con-
nection with his work on the mammals of Middle America; to Dr.
J. A. Allen, of the American Museum of Natural History, 108 speci-
mens for-use in connection with his study of the mammals of eastern
Siberia; to Mr. J. L. Bonhote, of the British Museum of Natural
History, who is making a study of the Malayan fauna, 18 skins and
skulls of J/us; to Dr. John M. Ingersoll, of Cleveland, Ohio, who is
working upon the comparative anatomy of the ithmoid region of the
mamma ‘ian skull, 16 specimens of skulls; to Dr. Harris H. Wilder, of
Smith Col.ege, for use in embryological studies, specimens of the
embryo of Janis javanica, to Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, sta-
tioned at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, 9 specimens of mammals from the
Philippine region; and to Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Academy of
Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, specimens of Vycticebus.

The Division of Birds furnished 13 specimens of Parws hudsonicus,
and 68 specimens, mainly of Ofocor/s, to Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of

monographic work; and a large number of Lower Siluric graptolites
from New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts, to Dr. John M. Clarke,
State paleontologist of New York.

PROGRESS IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

The overcrowded condition of the public halls which began a num-
of years ago precludes any extensive additions to the exhibition series,
and this must continue until the completion of the new building
recently authorized by Congress. Small objects can be given a place
here and there, but any considerable changes are rendered possible
only through the withdrawal and transfer to storage of collections
already on display. During the past year the principal progress made
in this connection has had reference to improvements in the methods
and details of installation.

In the Department of Anthropology temporary accommodations
have been furnished on the gallery of the north-west court for the
important ethnological collections from the Philippine Islands dis-
played at the Pan-American Exposition. The entire Eskimo collection
has been gone over, and the large series of specimens secured by the
Museum-Gates expedition has been arranged in the storage-cases of
the Pueblo court. The labeling of the historical collections has been
completed, and new case labels have been prepared for the Divisions
of Historic and Prehistoric Archeology and for the section of historic
religious ceremonials. The cases containing the manuscripts and vari-
ous editions of the Bible were repainted, and the collections rearranged
to facilitate their examination by visitors.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ot

The work of completing the exhibition series in several of the divi-
sions of the Department of Biology, and of improving their appearance
by changes in methods of installation, has been vigorously pushed.
Progress in this regard was most noticeable in the halls devoted to
mammals, marine invertebrates, insects, and fishes. About 200 case
labels have been added to the exhibits of mammals, birds, reptiles,
batrachians, insects, and the lower invertebrates, and a series of case
labels for the collection of comparative anatomy has been completed.

The interiors of the wall-cases, in the galleries of the south hall
containing Old World mammals, have been repainted in a color simi-
lar to that used in the corresponding cases on the main floor, and this
change has resulted in displaying the specimens to much better
advantage. <A similar change has also been made in regard to the
floor cases in the gallery containing small mammals. Three new
cases have been constructed against the south wall of this hall. One
contains the North American weasels and related forms; the two
others, the smaller South American mammals. The cases on the
main floor of the south hall have been furnished with new fittings, so
that they are now uniform in design and color. The labeling of the
American small mammals has been greatly improved, while the labels
for the Old World series have been revised and very largely replaced
with new ones. -

Considerable improvement has been made in the appearance of the
exhibition of marine invertebrates, which occupies the west hall in the
Smithsonian building. The interior of all the wall-cases has been
repainted in black, as furnishing a better background for the corals
and sponges than the maroon formerly employed. The display of
insects in the next adjoining hall or corridor has been enlarged by
extensive additions to the systematic series of North American insects,
which it is hoped to complete during the coming year.

The wall cases in the south-east range of the Museum building have
been reconstructed, and the systematic collection of casts of North
American fishes has been rearranged and installed to much better
advantage than formerly. A number of casts of large and striking
species have been repaired and repainted. The labeling of the casts
of reptiles and batrachians exhibited in floor cases in the same range
has also been largely revised.

The bird groups displayed in the main hall of the Smithsonian
building, sixteen in number, have been partly renovated, and one of
them, consisting of three fine specimens of the Argus pheasant, pre-
sented to the Museum some years age by Dr. W. L. Abbott, has been
entirely remounted, making it the most striking feature of the room.

Many important changes have been made in the halls containing the
geological collections. The exhibit of geographic ores in the south-
west court has been carefully overhauled, the cases being thoroughly
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

cleaned and the specimens rearranged. The nonmetallic minerals,
exhibited in the gallery of the same court, have been similarly worked
over. The cases in the west-south range containing the stratigraphic
and historical collections have been reconstructed and the specimens
rearranged. The collection of fossil plants has been partially rear-
ranged, and new labels have replaced the temporary ones on the Pale-
ozoic specimens. Labels have also been printed for the Triassic plants.
To the exhibition of vertebrate paleontology will soon be added a
specimen of C/aosaurus, the preparation of which has occupied nearly
a year, and the mounted skeleton of a mastodon obtained at Church,
Michigan, in 1901.

VISITORS.

There was, during the past year, a large increase in the number of
visitors to the national collections. The total number of persons
admitted to the Museum building was 315,307, against 178,888 for
1902, an increase of 81 per cent; and to the Smithsonian building
181,174, against 144,107 for the previous year, an increase of about 26
per cent.

The following tables show, respectively, the attendance during each
month of the past year, and during each year beginning with 1881,
when the Museum building was first opened to the public:

MEETINGS AND LECTURES.

In accordance with the custom of previous years, certain scientific
societies and other bodies were allowed the use of the lecture hall in
the Museum building for the purpose of holding meetings and giving
lectures, as follows: .

On September 26, 1902, the associates and friends of Maj. John
Wesley Powell gathered here to commemorate the life and services of
this distinguished public man, the founder and director of the Bureau
of American Ethnology and for some time Director of the Geological
Survey, whose lamented death occurred but three days before.

From November 18 to 20 a national conference of the various Audo-
bon societies of the United States was held, in conjunction with the
American Ornithologists’ Union.

On November 22 Prof. John Ritchie, jr., of the Yerkes Observa-
tory, delivered under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution an
interesting lecture on Recent Celestial Photography.

On November 25 Dr. L. O. Howard, Entomologist of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Honorary Curator of Insects in the National

Museum, lectured on the subject of Entomology before an audience
composed largély of officers of the United States Army and Navy.
40 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

On December 27 several interesting talks, illustrated with lantern
slides, were given by members of the Society for the Preservation of
Wild Flowers.

In the evening of January 1, 1903, an informal reception was ten.
dered to the members of the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, the American Society of Naturalists, and other
affiliated societies, then in session in this city.

During February and March a course of free Saturday afternoon
lectures was given, under the auspices of. the Biological Society of
Washington, as follows: February 14, An entomologist in China and
Japan, by Mr. C. L. Marlatt; February 21, Ancient birds and their
associates, by Mr. Frederic A. Lucas; February 28, Views of Liberia,
by Prof. O. F. Cook; March 7, The making of new plants, by Mr.
H. J. Webber; March 14, Three summers in Alaska, by Mr. Wilfred
H. Osgood.

On April 4 the lecture hall was used for the graduating exercises of
the Naval Medical School, and on April 14 for those of the Army
Medical School. i

The National Academy of Sciences held its annual meeting from
April 21 to 28, 1903, the business meetings taking place in the offices
of the assistant secretary, and the reading of papers in the lecture
hall.

CORRESPONDENCE.

One of the most onerous duties which has devolved upon the
Museum from the time of its establishment has been the furnishing
of information in response to inquiries from the public at large upon
all the various subjects within the scope of its several departments.
The letters received containing such requests average several daily
throughout the year, and are rarely confined to a single subject, often
relating to collections of greater or less size which are transmitted.
for identification. Nearly 900 lots of specimens were received under
these conditions during the past year. These communications also
have reference, in many cases, to the building up and maintenance of
collections, the construction of cases, the installation, labeling, and
‘ataloguing of specimens, and other topics connected with museum
administration. Every communication of this character, made in
good faith, is responded to as promptly as possible, although the
labor involved draws very heavily upon the time of both the scien-
tific and the clerical staffs.

A considerable proportion of the work of furnishing information
is accomplished through the medium of Museum publications, of
which more than 20,000 volumes and pamphlets were distributed
during the year, besides the sendings to regular correspondents.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 4]

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the Museum have consisted of an annual report,
comprising the second part, or volume, of the annual report of the
Smithsonian Institution; of a series of Proceedings for the ordinary
technical papers, and of a series of Bulletins for the longer technical
papers or monographs. In 1894 the National Herbarium, which, for
lack of space, had been held at the Department of Agriculture since
1869, was returned to the National Museum, but the publication con-
nected with it and entitled **‘ Contributions from the National Herba-
rium” established in 1890, continued to be issued by the Department
of Agriculture until this year, when Congress, upon the recommenda-
tion of the Secretary of Agriculture, transferred its management to
the National Museum, in accordance with the following item in the
sundry civil act for 1903:

For printing and publishing the contributions from the United States National
Herbarium, the editions of which shall not be less than three thousand copies,
including the preparation of necessary illustrations, proof reading, bibliographical
work, and special editorial work, seven thousand dollars: Provided, That one-half of
said copies shall be placed on sale at an advance of ten per centum over their cost.

Under this provision volumes 11 and vir previously published and
entitled respectively Botany of Western Texas, by J. M. Coulter, and
Systematic and Geographic Botany and Aboriginal Use of Plants, by
Coulter, Rose, Cook, and Chesnut, the editions of which had become
exhausted, were reprinted, and also the following new Contributions,
parts 1, 2, and 3 of volume vu, consisting of Studies of Mexican
and Central American Plants, by J. N. Rose; Economic Plants of
Porto Rico, by O. F. Cook and G. N. Collins; and A Study of cer-
tain Mexican and Guatemalan species of Polypodium, by William R.
Maxon.

Of the Bulletins of the Museum the most important one issued was
the second volume of Robert Ridgway’s extensive monograph on the
Birds of North and Middle America, covering the families Tanagridee
(Tanagers), Icteride (Troupials), Coerebide (Honey Creepers), and
Mniotiltidee (Wood Warblers). The third volume, sent to the printer
before the close of the fiscal year, treats of the Motacillide: (Wagtails
and Pipits); Hirundinide (Swallows), Vireonide (Vireos), Ampelidiz
(Waxwings), Ptiliognatide (Silken Chatterers), Dulide (Palm Chat-
terers), Laniide (Shrikes), Corvide (Crows and Jays), Paride (Tit-
mice), Sittide (Nuthatches), Certhiide (Creepers), Troglodytide
(Wrens), Cinclide (Dippers), Chameiidee (Wrentits), and Sylviide
(Kinglets, etc.).

Another noteworthy bulletin was that by Dr. Harrison G. Dyar, of
the Division of Insects, entitled A List of North American Lepidop-
tera and Key to the Literature of this Order of Insects. It is num-
bered 52, and comprises 723 octavo pages.
492 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The interest manifested in the history and anthropology of our
Philippine and other insular possessions rendered desirable the issu-
ance of instructions for the guidance of collectors of objects in these
branches, and to secure this purpose there has been printed an addi-
tional part of Bulletin 39 (Part Q), prepared by Mr. W. H. Holmes
and Prof. O. T. Mason, under the title Instructions to Collectors of
Historical and Anthropological Specimens. ;

The twenty-fourth volume of Proceedings, printed in bound form at
the beginning of the fiscal year, contains thirty-four papers (1241 to
1274. inclusive), all of which were issued in the form of separates dur-
ing the preceding year. Fifteen of these papers were prepared by
members of the Museum staff, ten by Dr. David Starr Jordan and his
assistants, being mainly descriptions of Japanese fishes represented in
the Museum collections, and the remainder by other correspondents
and collaborators of the Museum.

Papers numbered from 1275 to 1805, constituting volume xxv,
and those numbered from 1306 to 1332 of volume xxvi, were also
printed by June 30. It is expected that numbers 1333 to 1349 will
soon be published, and that volumes xxv and xxvi will appear in
bound form during the summer of 1903.

There is a continuous demand for certain of the Museum publica-
tions no longer in stock, but the means this year have permitted the
reprinting of only the following: Mr. Robert Ridgway’s paper on the
Humming Birds, from the Museum Report for 1900; Dr. Stejneger’s
paper on The Poisonous Snakes of North America, from the Report
for 1893; Bulletin 37, entitled A Preliminary Catalogue of the Shell-
bearing Marine Mollusks and Brachiopods of the Southeastern Coast
of the United States, by Dr. William H. Dall; parts F, G, H, I, J, K
of Bulletin 39, containing directions for collecting insects, shells, min-
erals, rocks, specimens illustrating the aboriginal uses of plants and
fossils, and the first volume of Bulletin 47, entitled Fishes of North
and Middle America, by Doctors Jordan and Evermann.

All the publications of the Museum are distributed by the Office of
Correspondence and Documents, and it is estimated that during the
year not less than 10,000 volumes and 35,000 separate papers were
sent to libraries and individuals in the United States and foreign
countries.

Appendix IV of this report contains a list of the publications of the
Museum, of the members of its staff, and also of outside collaborators
to the extent that the papers of the latter were based on Museum
material. The number of authors is 90, and the total number of
papers mentioned by title is 277.

LIBRARY.

The assignment to the library of two of the galleries erected last
vear, one in the west-north, the other in the north-west range, has
added a considerable amount of space, which has long been needed.
This area has been fitted up with convenient stacks, permitting a gen-
eral overhauling and a more systematic rearrangement of the books
and pamphlets. During the latter part of the summer of 1902 the
library was closed for a time to enable this work to be carried out.
Its contents were classified and a large number of volumes belonging
to the Smithsonian deposit were turned over to the Institution for
transmission to the Library of Congress.

The increase of the library has been mainly due to two very impor-
tant gifts—the Hubbard and Schwarz and the Dall collections. The
former, consisting of 300 books and 1,500 pamphlets, was brought
together by Mr. H. G. Hubbard and Mr. E. A. Schwarz (Custodian
of Coleoptera in the Museum), while carrying on their studies more
or less conjointly, and forms an accessory to their large collection of
insects, presented by them to the Museum several years ago. It is
an entomological library, having reference mainly to the American
Coleoptera. The contribution by Dr. William H. Dall; Honorary
Curator of Mollusks, comprises about 1,600 bound volumes and about
2,000 pamphlets on the mollusca, a special library of great value, which
has been accumulated by Dr. Dall during many years of research. It
is accompanied by a card catalogue covering the literature of Con-
chology, both recent and fossil, down to about 1860, though materially
added to since then.

The above collections and also the Goode library, purchased in 1898,
have been provided with book-plates.

The Museum library now possesses 19,161 bound volumes, and
82,063 unbound pamphlets, periodicals, etc. The cataloguing done
during the year cemprised 916 books, 1,571 pamphlets, and 9,838 parts
of periodicals, and 3,316 cards were added to the authors? catalogue.
~ The number of books, pamphlets and periodicals borrowed from the
general library was 18,750, while the number assigned to the sectional
libraries was 4,833. There has been no change in the sectional libra-
ries, which are as follows:

PHOTOGRAPHY.

Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer of the Museum, reports that 1,689
negatives, 3,367 silver prints, 307 platinum prints, 49 lantern slides,
and 1,016 blueprints have been made, and a large number of prints
havebeen mounted. Under Mr. Smillie’s direction much photographic
work has also been done for the National Zoological Park and the
Astrophysical Observatory, an assistant having been furnished by
those bureaus for that purpose.

Mr. Smillie has continued to act as chairman of the board of exam-
iners in photography for the U. 5. Civil Service Commission.

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

The Museum has received, as usual, important assistance from
several of the Departments and Bureaus of the Government. Its rela-
tions to the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. S. Fish Commission, the
Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology and Botany of the
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology,
especially in regard to the transmission of collections, have been
referred to elsewhere. Officers of the Army and Navy stationed in
the new possessions have made valuable contributions, and representa-
tives abroad of the Department of State have been instrumental in
securing interesting material. The Departments of War and of the
Navy have rendered generous help toward building up the collections
of history and of the implements of war, having presented and
deposited during the year many objects of exceeding interest and
value. The Army Medical Museum has cooperated most liberally in
promoting the welfare of the recently established Division of Physical
Anthropology, and special acknowledgments are due to the Quarter-
master’s Department of the-Army for many courtesies in connection
with the transportation of specimens and outfits to and from distant
points.

THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION.

An act providing for the celebration in the city of St. Louis, Mis-
souri, of the one hundredth anniversary of the acquisition by the
United States of the ‘* Louisiana Territory,” purchased from France,
46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

was approved by the President of the United States on March 3, 1901.
The sundry civil bill for the year ending June 30, 1903, carried an
appropriation of $800,000 to enable the Executive Departments, and
also the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus, the U. 5. Fish Com-
mission, the Department of Labor, the Library of Congress, and the
Bureau of the American Republics, to prepare suitable exhibits for the
occasion. Out of this appropriation the sum of $110,000 was allotted
to the Smithsonian Institution. Congress also appropriated $450,000
for the construction of a building for the display of the Government
collections.

Dr. Frederick W. True, Head Curator of Biology, has been desig-
nated by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to represent the
Institution and its bureaus on the Government board. The exposition
is expected to open on April 30 and to close on November 30, 1904.
The preparation of the exhibits under the Smithsonian Institution was
well under way at the close of the year, and it is intended that the
display made shall surpass any previous efforts by this branch of the
Government.

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF.

The organization of the Museum comprises an administrative office
and three scientific departments, as follows: Antbropology, with 9
divisions and 4 sections; Biology, with 9 divisions and 13 sections,
and Geology, with 3 divisions and 3 sections. This shows an increase
of one division in Anthropology and of one section in Biology, the
former relating to physical anthropology, the latter to the lower algee,
which have been separated from the higher alge. At the close of the
year the scientific staff consisted of 3 head curators, 17 curators, 13
assistant curators, 15 custodians, 12 aids, 4 associates, and 2 collabo-
rators, a total of 66 persons, only about one-half of whom were under
salary from the National Museum, the others, mainly employees of
other Government bureaus, serving in a volunteer or honorary
capacity.

Mr. W. H. Holmes, Head Curator of the Department of Anthro-
pology, having been appointed Chief of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator of Ethnology, was on November
15, 1902, placed in charge of the Department as acting head curator.
Dr. A. Hrdlicka, whose researches on the physical characteristics of
man are widely known, was on May 1, 1908, designated as assistant
curator of the newly organized Division of Physical Anthropology.
Dr. G. T. Moore, of the Department of Agriculture, was appointed
custodian of the section of lower algz on May 25, and at the same
time the designation of Mr. W. T. Swingle was changed to custodian
of the section of higher alge.

On December 31, 1902, Mr. Charles T, Simpson resigned his posi-
tion as principal aid in the Division of Mollusks, being succeeded by
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47

Mr. Paul Bartsch, whose place was in turn taken by Mr. William B.

Marshall, appointed aid on April 1. Mr. R. G. Paine was made an

aid in the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians on April 6, and Mr.

T. Wayland Vaughan, Custodian of the Madreporarian Corals on
June 30.

A list of the members of the Museum staff is given in Appendix L.

NECROLOGY.

It is gratifying to note that during the past year no deaths have
oceurred in connection with the Museum staff, though among its
friends there have been several losses, only two of which will be men-
tioned here.

The first was that of Maj. J. W. Powell, explorer, geologist, and
anthropologist, for some time director of the U. S. Geological Survey,
and the founder and director of the Bureau of American Ethnology.
An account of his life and work will be found in the first volume of
the Smithsonian report for 1902, and it need only be recalled here that
in nearly all the varied subjects of his personal studies and of his
administrative oversight he was brought into close relations with the
Museum, which is indebted to him for valuable collections, for wise
suggestions, and for a continued interest in its welfare.

The second loss resulted from the death of Dr. James Cushing
Merrill, of the United States Army, which occurred in Washington
on October 27, 1902. Doctor Merrill was born in Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts, in 1853, and after attending school in Germany, he entered
the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, from which
he was graduated in 1874. About a year later he was appointed
assistant surgeon in the United States Army. While stationed at
yarious military posts in the west and southwest, he devoted much
time to the study and collection of birds and eggs, generously giving
away his collections, the National Museum being one of his favored
beneficiaries. The accession records show that between 1875 and 1896
no less than 28 separate lots of specimens were received from him,
these including a large number of valuable skins, eggs, and nests of
birds, besides mammals, fishes, and other natural history material.
Doctor Merrill was elected an active member of the American Orni-
thologists’ Union at its first congress in 1883. He was a careful and
accurate observer of the habits of birds and mammals, and also con-
tributed several important papers to scientific literature. Two of
these were published in the Proceedings of the National Museum,
their titles being as follows: Notes on the Ornithology of Southern
Texas, being a list of birds observed in the vicinity of Fort Brown,
Texas. from February, 1876, to June, 1878, and On the Habits of the
Rocky Mountain Goat.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3.

By Otis T. Mason,
Acting Head Curator.

During the year a number of changes have taken place in the
personnel of the Department of Anthropology. When Mr. W. H.
Holmes, the Head Curator, was made Chief of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, Prof. O. T. Masen, Curator of Ethnology, was desig-
nated as Acting Head Curator, Dr. Walter Hough, Assistant Curator,
became Acting Curator of the Division of Ethnology; and Mr. Paul
Beckwith, Aid in the Division of History, was temporarily assigned
to the Assistant Curatorship of Ethnology. Owing to continued fail-
ing health, Mrs. Fanny Dinsmore, stenographer, was compelled to
resign, and in January Mr. W. E. Wilson was selected to fill the
place. In January Mr. H. W. Hendley, who had assisted the Depart-
ment in preparing its exhibit for the Pan-American Exposition, was
appointed preparator in the Department, and in February Dr. Ales
Hrdlicka was called to the position of assistant curator in the newly
established Division of Physical Anthropology.

The work of the Department during the year has consisted largely
in cataloguing, caring for, and installing the collections received,
although the preparation of an exhibit for the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition has called for a large share of attention. This work is in
charge of Mr. W. H. Holmes, who has undertaken to collect a series
of exhibits illustrative of the highest artistic achievements of the
American aborigines.

Until the present year the Department has been devoted entirely to
the culture side of the science of man, collections illustrating the
physical characters of the race, normal as well as abnormal, having
been cared for in the Army Medical Museum; but a large part of this
material has recently been transferred to the National Museum, and a
laboratory for the study of this branch has been established under the
curatorship of Dr. Ales Hrdlicka. Thus, for the first time in its his-
tory, the National Museum embraces the whole subject of -anthro-
pology, physical and cultural, so far at least as this branch can be
represented and illustrated by material objects.

52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The collections assigned to the Department during the year number
24,319 specimens, and have been distributed among the several divisions

and sections as follows:

GIFTS.

Among the numerous gifts received in the Department during the
year the following may be especially mentioned:

1. Collection of ethnological material from Sumatra and the Anda-
man and Nicobar islands, presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Phila-
delphia, who is one of the most generous benefactors of the Muscum.
These collections number some 500 specimens, and illustrate the native
arts and industries of various primitive peoples of whom little is gen-
erally known. Their value is greatly enhanced by the fact that they
were obtained directly from the natives by a trained collector, and are
accompanied by all essential historical and descriptive data.

2. A large collection made bythe late Col. F. F. Hilder, of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, in the Philippine Islands for the Pan-American
Exposition, and presented to the National Museum by the Government
board of the exposition. It includes upward of 1,500 specimens, and
illustrates in an effective manner many of the native industries of the
pou

- A small series of ethnological specimens collected among the
anne Indians of southeastern Alaska by Lieut. G. T. Emmons,
U.S. Navy. These specimens have especial value, because of the
careful record of tribe, manufacture, and use furnished by the collector.

4. A series of stone implements, believed to be of paleolithic age,
from the lateritic deposits near Madras, India, presented by Mr. H.
W. St ae of London, England.

CARE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The numerous accessions of the year, especially the large collections
of Abbott, Hilder, and others, have made it necessary to contract the
exhibition space in order to make room for the ever-growing study
series and for laboratory purposes. The demands of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition and of the newly-established Division of Physical
Anthropology for space have increased the embarrassment. The con-
gestion has been somewhat relieved by fitting up the galleries over
the south-west and west-north ranges, but overcrowding is still every-
where apparent.

The usual watchfulness over the ethnological collections to protect
them from insects and rust has been exercised, and Mr. Joseph Palmer
has devoted a large part of his time to the work of overhauling, reno-
vating and poisoning.

Until additional exhibition space is provided the installation of new
material is practically at an end, excepting where exhibits that have
been jong before the publie are replaced by others of greater interest.
-

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57

The work of labeling the exhibits has been carried forward with all
possible energy during the year, and great advance has been made
over previous years, especially in the labeling of the larger units, such
as halls, alcoves, groups of exhibits, and cases.

In the Division of Ethnology the Philippine collection has been
temporarily arranged in cases in the north-west court gallery; the col-
lections obtained through the Museum-Gates expedition in Arizona
during the previous year have been placed in good order in the storage
series of the Pueblo court, and Mr. Thomas W. Sweeny has classified
and rearranged the large Eskimo study collection in the storage bases of
the north-west range. Mr. Joseph Palmer and Mr. Charles Luscombe
have been engaged in mending, modeling, making facsimilies of
specimens, and allied laboratory work.

During the entire fiscal year the hall of prehistoric archeology has
been closed on account of repairs, but the work of cataloguing and
caring for the collections has gone on without interruption under the
supervision of Mr. KE. P. Upham.

A large collection of Washington relics, transferred to the Museum
from the Patent Office, has been installed in the hall of American history
in connection with cognate exhibits, under the supervision of Mr.
A. H. Clark and Mr. Paul Beckwith. The exhibition series in this
division is all labeled and the crowded condition of the study series
has been greatly relieved by removing portions of it to the new gal-
leries. It has long been felt that a suitable catalogue of the historical
collections should be prepared for publication by the Museum, and
during the year this work was initiated by the. employment of Miss
Elizabeth Bryant Johnston, who has completed a descriptive catalogue
of the personal relics of George Washington.

In the Divisionof Physical Anthropology there is as yet no exhibition
series, the time of the new curator, Doctor Hrdlicka, having been
devoted to organizing the division and fitting up a laboratory of
anthropometry.

In the sections of historic religious ceremonials and classical arche-
ology, few changes have been made save that the labeling has been
carried practically to completion.

In the Division of Medicine the curator has been engaged in prepar-
ingacard catalogue of the collections. Each specimen, whether on exhi-
bition, in the study series or in storage, has an individual card, giving
name, number, collector, mode of acquisition, etc.

EXPLORATIONS.

During the yeara very limited amount of field work has been under-
taken by members of the Department’s staff. Mr. W. H. Holmes
continued his explorations in archeology on behalf of the Bureau of
Ethnology. Under his direction numerous mound relics and fossil
58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

bones of ancient mammals were obtained near Kimmswick, Missouri,
by Mr. Gerard Fowke, and extensive collections were made in ancient
flint quarries and workshops in Carter County, Kentucky, and in Har-
rison County. Indiana, illustrating all the phases of flint working.

Mr. Holmes, aided by Mr. Fowke, made investigations in a hematite
mine at Leslie, Missouri, obtaining the collections referred to on a
preceding page.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, concluded
important explorations in the islands of Santo Domingo and Porto
Rico. It has long been known that the latter island was in some way
a sacred retreat of the ancient inhabitants of the Antilles. Many
years ago a large collection of objects of stone was presented to the
Museum by George Latimer, and Doctor Fewkes was successful in
supplementing this with valuable material, adding many new forms.
In addition to his archeological explorations, Doctor Fewkes made
careful studies of the natives, including the whites, blacks, and rem-
nants of ancient aborigines.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, has continued his explorations
in the northern portion of the island of Sumatra and the small islands
adjoining, and the mainland in the Straits Settlements, contributing
the valuable collections already described.

RESEARCHES.

One of the chief aims of the Department of Anthropology has always
been to favor and encourage research, not only on the part of members
of the staff but of investigators elsewhere. Much attention has been
paid during the year to correspondence on every topic connected with
anthropology, and to obtain, if possible, for the friends of the Institu-
tion information that is not within their reach. Literature published
by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum on anthropo-
logical subjects has been freely distributed. This remark applies
equally to the ethnology of America, the Philippine Islands, and inci-
dentally to other parts of the world. The curators have been almost
daily importuned for information concerning the nature and use of
archeological relics.

A collection of Indian shields was sent to Mr. James Mooney, Mount
Scott, Oklahoma, for study in the field.

In the Division of History questions arise constantly as to the mean-
ing of inscriptions and the readings on coins and medals. Already, in
the new Division of Physical Anthropology a beginning has been
made in supplying special instructions to observers and students. In
the Division of Ceramics errors with reference to the age and sources
of pottery are corrected. With the public, great interest is man1-
fested in the ‘‘Synoptic Series” of the Museum, and teachers are con-
stantly receiving instructions with reference to the development of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

various lines of industrial apparatus. All the divisions of the Depart-
ment of Anthropology have been active in this regard during the past
year.

In December Dr. Hjalmar Stolpe, director of the Royal Museum of
Sweden, Stockholm, studied Polynesian. and South American col-
lections. ;

Professors H. Pittier, of Costa Rica, and C. V. Hartmann, of Stock-
holm, received instructions in casting archeological specimens in the
anthropological laboratory.

In March Dr. A. B. Hunter, of Raleigh, North Carolina, received
instructions in making casts, photographs, and other methods of
ethnological investigation with a view to studying the negro of the
South.

Mr. Wells F. Andrews, statistician of the Immigration Bureau in
the Treasury Department, made studies in the Division of Ethnology
‘n order to classify immigrants into the United States. The scheme
furnished has been adopted by the Department.

Dr. Waldemar Bogoras, of the American Museuin of Natural His-
tory, New York, made a careful examination of the Eskimo collection
in order to find Siberian material. His results will appear in the
publications of that institution.

Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, jr., and Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton
received instructions in the methods of primitive fire-making.

Dr. Carl Von den Steinen, of Berlin, made a special study of the
technological processes employed by the North American Indians,

-especially in weaving and basketry.

Subsequent to the meeting of the Society of Americanists in New
York, many of the foreign delegates visited the Museum, where a
reception was held in their honor.

Dr. E. A. Bogue made an examination of the denture in the Indian
crania.

The Curator of the Division of Ethnology finished his comprehen-
sive work on American Indian basketry and Doctor Hough submitted
for publication his monograph on the results of the Museum-Gates
expedition to Arizona in 1901, which was printed in the Annual Report
of the National Museum for that year.

Dr. A. Hrdlicka published a report on the Lansing skeleton in the
American Anthropologist for June.

An address delivered by Dr. Cyrus Adler in connection with the
opening of the semitic museum of Harvard University was published
by that institution.

Dr. I. M. Casanowicz published four papers based mainly on the col-
lections in the National Museum.
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

STORAGE.

Numerous specimens have been stored in buildings outside of the
Museum, but it has been the policy of the Department not to send out
of the building any specimens which can not be replaced in case of loss.
Asa result of this policy, the crowding of the halls has become more
embarrassing. Even the offices of the curators are being used as
receptacles of valued material for which there is no present place of
storage.

Since the death of Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of the Division of
Prehistoric Archeology, in 1902, Mr. Holmes has given especial atten-
tion to the interests of this division and has been faithfully assisted
by Mr. E. P. Upham.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3.

By FrepEerick W. TrRup,
Head Curator.

The principal features of the year covered by this report were the
improvement of the installation of the exhibition series, brought
about largely by placing the supervision of the work in the hands of
a single officer, and the enlargement of the quarters for the National
Herbarium. In the majority of classes the number of specimens
added to the collections was less than last year; but in scientific value
there was no appreciable decline. The number of zoological speci-
mens added was not less than 70,000, of which 9,000 were vertebrates.
About 35,000 botanical specimens were also received. Some important
improvements were made in the installation of the great zoological
study series, but the need of more space and better facilities were
keenly felt. Preparations for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St.
Louis, 1904, were actively begun, and were in an advanced condition
at the close of the year.

XXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

With the consent of the Assistant Secretary, Mr. F. A. Lucas,
Curator of the Division of Comparative Anatomy, was placed in tem-
porary charge of all exhibition work of the Department, November
1, 1902, and all the taxidermists and other natural history preparators
were directed to report to him. By this change the work has been
much better coordinated than hitherto, and the results obtained dur-
ing the year have been very satisfactory. The curators of the several
divisions are still called upon to select specimens for the exhibition
series, to furnish technical information for labels, or for the use of the
preparators, etc., but they are not expected to regularly supervise the
work of the preparators or to install collections in the exhibition
cases. There has been a growing recognition among the curators of
natural history museums of the fact that the needs of the general pub-
lic and of the special student and investigator are quite diverse, and
that endeavors to combine in one series collections of interest to both
are little better than a waste of time. The general public and the gen-
eral student are only confused by a multiplicity of specimens repre-
senting small variations of one species, or illustrating small steps in a

61
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Cd

single vital process, while the special student and investigator never
has too many specimens, and can seldom make much progress with
scant material.

The principal improvements during the year were in the halls
devoted to mammals, marine invertebrates, insects, and fishes. The
interior of the wall-cases of the South Hall gallery, containing Old
World mammals, was repainted to correspond in color with the cases
on the main floor and to set off the specimens properly, the color of
the unpainted burlap background having proved too dull. At the
same time the floor cases on the gallery containing the small mammals
were refitted to correspond with those below. The result has been
a creat improvement in the general appearance of the cases and visi-
bility of the collections. The very attractive group of African horse-
felled monkeys, Colobus caudatus, prepared some time ago with
specimens presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, was placed in a new
case especially adapted for properly displaying it. The specimens
were cleaned and the accessories renovated by the chief taxidermist.
On the main floor, devoted to American mammals, the south wall-cases
mentioned in last year’s report were finished and filled with South
American mammals, which are now installed in a satisfactory manner.
No room has as yet been found, however, for such large forms as the
tapir, pampas deer, etc. The majority of the floor-cases were furnished
with new fittings, uniform in design and color. The group of Rocky
Mountain sheep made originally for the World’s Columbian Exposi-
tion, 1893, was taken from storage and erected at the northwest cor-
ner of the hall. The artificial rock-work was cut down and partially
remodeled and the specimens renovated by the chief taxidermist.
This completes the representation by groups of the principal large
ruminants of North America, except that space has not been found for
the White Goat group. The intention is to let this take the place of
one of the two caribou groups. Numerous small mammals were
added to the general North American series. A number of large
mammals were mounted during the year for the St. Louis Exposition,
but will not be displayed in Washington until the close of the exposi-
tion. New uniform printed labels for the entire American series of
small mammals, revised and brought up to date as regards nomencla-
ture, etc., were printed and placed with the specimens during the
year. The labels for the Old World series were also revised, and,
where necessary, new ones were prepared, printed, and put on the
specimens. The entire mammal exhibit, therefore, with a few excep-
tions in some groups, is now thoroughly and satisfactorily labeled.
The Indian rhinoceros, which had been on exhibition for many years,
was withdrawn, as it had become unsightly through the cracking of
the skin and could not be repaired satisfactorily.

In the hall in the Smithsonian building devoted to the lower inverte-
brates the interiors of all the wall-cases were repainted. As these
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

cases, for the most part, contain corals, it was decided to use black for
the background as best suited to bring the specimens into relief. The
corals and sponges were rearranged and some specimens added to the
general North American series.

Tn the insect hall the exhibit of North American species was extended
by the addition of representatives of the orders Lepidoptera, Euplex-
optera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and Diptera.

After the collection of fishes exhibited at the Pan-American Expo-
sition, Buffalo, 1901, was returned, a reclassification of all the casts
was made, the series being divided into two sections—marine fishes
and fresh-water fishes. The cases standing against the walls were
reconstructed and furnished with large glass and paneled bases, so as
to present a uniform appearance around the*hall. A large shark and
several other fishes of very large size were placed on top of the cases
and provided with new framed labels. The descriptive labels used at
Buffalo were mounted on standards of uniform design and placed
beside the species to which they refer. The series now exhibited, aside
from the small representation of deep-sea fishes, is entirely North
American. While it is desired to exhibit various series from other
parts of the world, there is not sufficient room for this purpose in the
present quarters. For this reason the South American fishes preserved
in formalin have been temporarily withdrawn. These preparations
were in quite good condition when last examined, but they are not
entirely satisfactory for exhibition on account of the bleaching of the
colors, dullness of the eyes, etc. Experiments were made during the
year in casting from formalin specimens. The results were quite satis-
factory, and it is believed that a series of casts made in this way and
painted might prove best for a permanent exhibit. A number of
molds of fishes and some casts of large fishes, which have been used by
the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries in connection with
various expositions, were transferred to the Museum by the Commis-
sioner. Several of these casts were repaired and placed on exhibition,
as already mentioned.

All the labels for the reptiles and batrachians were reprinted in the
same style as the mammal labels, the object being to have all the faunal
labels uniform as regards matter and general appearance. Instead of
the particular locality in which a specimen exhibited was obtained,
these labels contain a brief statement of the geographical range of the
species represented, together of course with the common and scientific
names, the catalogue number of the specimen, and in the case of gifts,
the name of the donors. Specimens received from Government sur-
veys are labeled with the names of the organizations which transmitted
them.

Few changes of importance were made in connection with the
exhibits of birds and mollusks, but copy was prepared for new labels
for the entire North American series of birds. The labels had not
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

been printed when the year closed. The groups of birds, 16 in num-
ber, which were originally made for various expositions, were over-
hauled, and the cases made dust tight as far as possible and provided
with new framed labels. Under present conditions it is not deemed
expedient to build new cases for these groups. The beautiful speci-
mens of the Argus pheasant presented some time ago by Dr. W. L.
Abbott, were brought together by the taxidermists in the form of a
eroup, with ground-work, and placed ina new case. This group is one
of the most attractive and interesting objects in the entire exhibition
series. The baseboards of all the large alcove-cases were repainted.

In order to find room for the enlargement of the National Herba-
rium it became necessary to abandon the limited space on the Kast
Hall gallery previously allotted for botanical exhibits. This was done
most reluctantly, but in view of the necessities of the case it was
deemed unavoidable. With this change the Museum definitely aban-
doned making botanical exhibits for the present, but with the hope
that after the new building provided for by Congress is erected, abun-
dant room will be found for such collections.

During the year each of the exhibition halls was provided with a
large sign, calling attention in a few words to its contents, as for
example, ‘‘Lower Invertebrates,” ‘‘American Mammals,” ete. In
addition, uniform framed case labels, about 200 in number, were
provided for all the cases containing mammals, birds, reptiles,
batrachians, insects, and lower invertebrates. The series of case
labels for the exhibit of comparative anatomy was also completed.

A considerable number of requests were received during the year
for photographs of various groups and single objects in the exhibi-
tion series, chiefly for purposes of publication. The Bureau of
Engraving and Printing made photographs and sketches of the
mounted bison as a basis for the figure of that animal placed on
the new ten-dollar bill. An American eagle was mounted in a special
attitude for a similar purpose. Prof. M. M. Metealf, of the Woman’s
College of Baltimore, made a number of photographs of skeletons
and other objects for a forthcoming work on evolution. Dr. D. G.
Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, obtained photo-
graphs of certain whale skulls for a work on the mammals of Central
America. . :

EXPLORATIONS.

In the spring of 1903, Mr. F. A. Lucas, accompanied by Messrs.
William Palmer and J. W. Scollick, visited one of the stations of the
Cabot Steam Whaling Company, Newfoundland, to obtain a large whale
for the St. Louis Exposition. Toward the close of the fiscal year Mr.
Lucas reported that the skeleton and casts of the exterior of a sulphur-
bottom whale, about 75 feet long, had been obtained. By invitation
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65

of the Geographical Society of Baltimore, Messrs. B. A. Bean and
J. H. Riley accompanied the expedition of the society to the Bahamas
to collect aquatic and land vertebrates. By invitation of Dr. L. O.
Howard, Dr. H. G. Dyar, accompanied by Mr. R. P. Currie, of the
National Museum, and Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agri-
culture, made an expedition to British Columbia to collect insects, and
especially mosquitoes, under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution.
Mr. G. 8S. Miller, jr., spent a few weeks in collecting small mammals
in the vicinity of Hampton, Virginia. Messrs. Richmond, Ashmead,
Bartsch, and Currie spent some days in Philadelphia in the study of
the zoological collections of the Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Rose
visited the Museum of the New York Botanical Garden. Mr. W. R.
Maxon spent two months in Jamaica (April and May, 1903), where
he made a very large collection of plants, and especially of ferns.
He also obtained some fine examples of the large white ant nests found
in the island.

ACCESSIONS.

The accessions of the year, considered as separate lots of varying
sizes received from different sources, were considerably less than last
year, except in the Division of Plants and the Section of Birds’ Eggs.
The accessions of plants were greater in number than in any year since
1895, being in all 575, but the number of specimens comprised in them
was less than in the previous year, viz, about 53,500 specimens in
1902, and about 35,000 in 1903. The accessions of birds’ eggs, on the
contrary ; seareeci a more specimens than in 1902. The whole num-
ber of cena specimens received during the year was, as already
stated, about 70,000; of plants about 35,000 specimens. A notable and
most important one of the accessions was an increase in the num-
ber of types and cotypes presented, which comprise insects, fishes,
birds, and crustaceans. Among the largest zoological accessions
received were a collection of about 19,000 gall wasps and parasites
made in Canada, and transmitted by the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture; about 4,000 Costa Rican insects, purchased from Mr. P. Schild,
of Hamburg, Germany; about 2,000 Chilean insects, presented by
Mr. E. C. Reed, of Concepcion; a collection of about 2,000 fish, birds’
eos, sacllineis, and other marine invertebrates from the Hawaiian
Islands, transmitted by the U. 8. Fish Commission; a collection com-
prising about 1,500 birds’ eggs, insects and mammals from Paraguay;
the East Indian collections of Dr. Abbott, consisting of more than
1,200 mammals, birds, reptiles, ete. Considering the character of Dr.
Abbott’ s collections, which contain hundreds of sarurneceile they should
perhaps have been meen first, as it is obviously more difficult to
assemble large numbers of these animals than of any other class. The
largest collection of plants received during the year was one made by

5

NAT mus 1903
66 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, in the Yellowstone National Park. It
comprises about 5,800 specimens, and was very generously donated to
the Museum by the collector. This is probably the largest scientific
collection of plants ever made in the park. Next in size was the col-
lection made by Mr. William R. Maxon, of the Museum staff, in
Jamaica, comprising about 2,000 specimens, chiefly ferns.

It is a pleasure to record the continued activity of Dr. W. L.
Abbott in the exploration of the Kast Indies. The collections received
during the year were chiefly from the coast and islands of northwest-
ern Sumatra, as far south as Siboga, and from the Riou Peninsula, just
south of Singapore. They comprise, as already mentioned, mammals,
birds, reptiles, and batrachians, fishes, and insects. The Sumatran
mammals, about 500 in number, were studied by Mr. G. 8. Miller, jr.,
who discovered among them a new ape (A/acacus fuscus), four new
species of mouse deer (genus Z7agu/us), nine new squirrels, a new genus
and five new species of mice, and a new porcupine (Zrichys macrotis).
The birds from the same region also comprised about 500 specimens,
representing 152 species, of which 19 were found by Dr. C. W. Rich-
mond to be new to science. The collections from Pahang and the
Riou Archipelago have already yielded four new species of mouse
deer, and are probably as important as the preceding one for the light
they will throw on the distribution of Malayan species. The National
Museum has received from Dr. Abbott, since the beginning of his
explorations in the East Indies, no less than 2,500 mammals, 3,900
birds, 800 reptiles and batrachians, besides very numerous specimens
of other classes.

In 1902 the U. 8. Fish Commission steamer A/batross was sent to
the Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of continuing the investigation
of the fisheries. In the course of this work large collections were
made in various branches of natural history and transmitted to the
Museum. Those received during the year covered by this report were
a valuable collection of birds’ eggs, about 1,500 marine mollusks in
alcohol, many new to the Government collections, and about 100 species
apparently undescribed; a collection of corals, and a second lot of
crustaceans. The Commission also transmitted a collection of 85 birds,
mainly from Laysan Island, north of Hawaii, including the type of a
tern, Procelsterma saxatilis Fisher. From the Albatross Samoan Expe-
dition of 1902 were received corals and crustaceans in addition to the
specimens transmitted last year. The Commission also furnished
about 800 specimens of the commoner species of marine invertebrates
of Woods Hole, Massachusetts, for distribution to educational estab-
lishments, together with a small collection of fishes from the same
locality, a specimen of the Tile fish (Lopholatilus), from 70 miles off
Nomans Land, the type and cotype of a new species of white-fish
( Coregonus stanleyi), from Aroostook County, Maine, and a cotype of
anew fish (//adropterus evermanni), from Tippecanoe Lake, Indiana.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67

Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, of East Las Vegas, New Mexico, pre-
sented eight lots of insects of different orders, containing many new
species, and including types and cotypes of species described by him;
also three lots of amphipod crustaceans and leeches, the former rep-
resenting a new form found in a warm spring.

An interesting collection of reptiles and batrachians from northern
Mexico and North Carolina was purchased from Brimley Brothers,
Raleigh, North Carolina. It contained a series of a salamander
(Desmognathus quadrimaculata), which had not been recognized since
Holbrook’s time. From the same source was obtained a small collec-
tion of North Carolina fishes, one of which was found to be unde-
scribed and was named Wotropis brimleyt by Mr. B. A. Bean; also
eight specimens of the very rare skipper, Pamphila carolina Skinner.

Among the most important purchases of the year were the zoological
collections made by Mr. William Foster in the vicinity of Sapucay,
a small town near Ascuncion, Paraguay. They comprise about 800
insects, 600 birds’ eggs, and 350 small mammals. The mammals were
principally bats. The specimens were all carefully prepared and
labeled and filled important gaps in the Government collections.

Mammals.—In addition to Dr. Abbott’s East Indian mammals and
chose from Paraguay just mentioned, the Museum received several
other accessions which deserve mention. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S.
Army, added to his generous donations of previous years two collec-
tions of small mammals, one from the Yellowstone Park, comprising
about 300 specimens, and the other from Fort Snelling, Minnesota,
comprising about 200 specimens. The collections of Kuropean small
mammals, already very rich, was increased by two collections, one
from Switzerland and one from Norway. An excellent series of
Japanese rodents and bats, purchased during the year, represents the
first well-prepared collection of mammals received by the Museum
from that country. Mr. B. 8. Rairden, United States Consul at
Batavia, Java, obtained for the Museum two specimens of a Javan
mouse-deer, which proved to be an undescribed species of much inter-
est, and was named Zragulus focalinus by Mr. G.S. Miller, jr. A
somewhat imperfect but very valuable skeleton of a peculiar porpoise
from the Hawaiian Islands was presented by Prof. Charles H. Gilbert
of the Stanford University. It represents the species Pseudorcu cras-
sidens, a form intermediate between the killers and blackfish, which
has not been obtained hitherto from the vicinity of the Hawaiian
Islands.

Birds.—Mr. Homer Davenport, of Morris Plains, New Jersey, pre-
sented to the Museum during the year 22 large and valuable birds
from his extensive aviary, among which were an Australian Goose, a
Javan Jungle-fowl, a Black-winged Peacock, Pavonigripennis, regarded
by some zoologists as a distinct species, and several beautiful pheas-
ants, including Diard’s Fire-back Pheasant, Lophura diard:. From

65 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Mr. A. Boucard were purchased two rare birds of paradise, Paradisea
quilielmi and Rhipidornis guiliedmi-I1I. A pair of rare flightless
cormorants from the Galapagos Islands, and about 300 birds from
this group and the islands off the west coast of Mexico, including a
series of Vesomimus trifasciatus, were also purchased. The Bishop
Museum, Honolulu, presented a collection of the birds of Guam, com-
posing about 44 specimens, representing species not previously con-
tained in the Government collection. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston,
presented about 50 desirable Honduras birds, and about 800 specimens
from Chiriqui, Costa Rica, were obtained from him in exchange. The
Biological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture, transmitted a
fine collection of birds’ eggs from different parts of North America.

Reptiles and batrachians.—Messrs. Brimley and Sherman presented
a fine series of salamanders from North Carolina, and Mr. E. J. Brown
a number of rare reptiles from southern Florida. In a small collec-
tion from Cocos Island, Costa Rica, presented by Prof. P. Biolley,
were five specimens of a new gecko, described by Doctor Stejneger
under the name of Spherodactylus pacificus.

Fishes.—The accessions of fishes were remarkable on account of the
number of type specimens and cotypes included among them. An
especially important accession consisted of 42 types of species of
Hawaiian fishes, collected in 1889 and described by Dr. O. P. Jenkins,
of Stanford University. These were donated to the Museum by Doc-
tor Jenkins, and are # continuation of the series presented in 1901. A
collection of Japanese fishes, comprising 75 species, of which 3 were
represented by types and 16 by cotvpes, was presented by Stanford
University. They were collected by President D. 8. Jordan, by the
University of Tokyo, and by K. Otaki. Included with them were the
types of Bryostemma tarsodes and Bryolophus lysimus, two species
obtained near Unalaska Island by the A/butross. The types of the Jap-
anese species Draconetta xenica and Cyttopsis itea were also received
during the year.

Among single specimens of interest should be mentioned a very large
pipe-fish, /%stularia tabaccaria, 44 feet long, from Campeche Bank,
Mexico, presented by E. E. Saunders & Co. Dr. S. Wier Mitchell
presented a large salmon weighing 47 pounds, taken by him at Cas-
capedia, Quebec. Casts of this fine fish and of the pipe-fish were made
for the exhibition series. A deep-sea pelican-fish, genus Gastrostomus,
was received during the year from the U.S. S. Vero. It was obtained
during the survey for the trans-Pacific cable at a depth of between
2,000 and 3,000 fathoms. Mr. Louis Mobray, of Bermuda, obtained
a living specimen of the large Conger eel, Channomurena vittata, and
sent it to the New York Aquarium. Upon its death, which oecurred
in a few months, it was sent to the Museum by the director of the
aquarium, at the suggestion of Prof. C. L. Bristol. Dr. J. C. Thomp-

rc
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

son, U. S. Navy, presented a small but interesting collection of fishes
from the Dry Tortugas, Florida. The accessions from the U. 8.
Fish Commission and from Mr. H. H. Brimley have been already
mentioned. (See pp. 65 and 67.)

Mollusks.—In addition to the collections of the U.S. Fish Commis-
sion, already referred to, mention should be made of the donations of
two constant contributors to the Museum, Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd and
Rey. H. Loomis. Mrs. Oldroyd presented about 150 marine shells
from California in exceptionally fine condition, and Mr. Loomis’s
specimens of about 50 species from Japan and the Loochoo Islands
included many desiderata. California shells were also presented by
Mr. F. A. Woodworth, of San Francisco, and Hawatian land shells
by Mr. H. W. Henshaw, of Hilo, Hawaii. A second consignment of
land and fresh-water shells from central Asia was received from the
Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia. Among single
specimens of special value should be mentioned a fine Voluta mamilla,
a large and very rare shell from Tasmania. A collection of Australian
land and fresh-water shells, comprising species not previously repre-
sented in the Museum, was purchased.

Insects.—The three largest accessions of insects—the U. 8. Depart-
ment of Agriculture collection from Canada (18,947 specimens), the
Costa Rican collection purchased of P. Schild (4,000 specimens), and
the collection from Chili presented by Mr. E. C. Reed (2,021 speci-
mens)-—have already been mentioned. Many of the remaining acces-
sions, 254 in number, contain material of great interest and value, but
it is obviously impossible to refer in detail to more than a few of
them in this report. (For a complete list see Appendix II.) One
of the most important was a collection of African butterflies received
in exchange from the Royal Natural History Museum, Stockholm,
which included examples of many species described by Doctor Auri-
villius. Another important exchange was effected with the American
Entomological Society, through which the Museum received examples
of about 100 species of Mexican and Central American Hymenoptera,
many of them cotypes of species described by Mr. Cresson. Prof.
Charles Robertson, of Carlenville, Illinois, presented cotypes of 19
species of Hyimenoptera described by him. A similar collection of
Coleoptera, presented by Prof. H. C. Fall, of Pasadena, California,
contained 34 cotypes of his species. A collection of mites, containing
types and cotypes, was presented by Prof. Robert H. Wolcott, of the
University of Nebraska.

Lower invertebrates.—The accessions of lower invertebrates, like
those of fishes, are noteworthy on account of the number of types and
cotypes included among them. The collections transmitted by the
U. 8. Fish Commission have been already mentioned. From the
Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France, was received a valuable
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

exchange comprising about 50 species of fresh-water crabs, nearly all
of which were previously unrepresented in the Government collection.
Many of the specimens were cotypes. The Stanford University pre-
sented a series of desirable specimens of Japanese crustaceans col-
lected by Doctor Jordan and Mr. J. O. Snyder in 1900. It included
several species previously undescribed. A small but interesting col-
lection of crustaceans from the Maldive Islands, including several
cotypes, was received in exchange from the Museum of Comparative
Zoology. They were collected by Doctor Agassiz and party in 1901-2.
Dr. S. J. Holmes, of the University of Michigan, presented 14 lots of
New England amphipod crustaceans, among which were types of sev-
eral species. Two smaller lots, with representations of other orders
of crustaceans from Costa Rica and Cocos Island, were presented by
the Museo Nacional, of San José, Costa Rica. Among them were
types of species of amphipods described by T. R. Rk. Stebbings. Four
lots of isopod crustaceans, including types, were presented by the
Harriman Alaskan expedition. Dr. C. H. Kigenmann, of the Indiana
State University, presented specimens of 4 species of crustaceans from
Cuba, including types of 8 species.

A yaluable collection of European parasites, comprising trematodes,
cestodes, and nematodes, was received by the Bureau of Animal
Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture, and catalogued in the
section of helminthological collections, National Museum. The Mu-
seum received a collection of parasites of fishes from Prof. Edwin
Linton, of Washington, Pennsylvania. The study collection of para-
sites is considered the finest scientific collection of the kind now existing
in the United States.

Plants.—The total number of accessions to the National Herbarium
during the year was 595, a number which has not been reached for the
last eight years. Of this number, 120 accessions, comprising about
5,000 specimens, were received through the U. S. Department of
Agriculture.

Doctor Mearns’s large collection from the Yellowstone National
Park, which constituted the most extensive accession of the year, has
already been mentioned. Probably next in interest is the collection
made by Mr. W. R. Maxon, of the Museum staff, in Jamaica, which
comprised about 2,000 specimens, chiefly ferns. Two important col-
lections from the Philippine Islands, comprising about 1,400 specimens,
were received in exchange from the Insular Bureau of Agriculture,
Manila. These are belieyed to be the first collections from the islands
made by American botanists. Another collection of Philippine plants,
comprising about 1,000 specimens, was received from the Royal Botani-
val Gardens, Kew, England, in continuation of an exchange with that
institution. Capt. J. Donnell Smith has continued his valuable dona-
tions of West Indian and Central American plants. He presented
during the year a sixth series, consisting of 3875 specimens.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 71

Purchases of plants to the amount of $1,000 were made during the
year. The most important items were continuations of the California
collections of Mr. A. A. Heller (1,055 specimens) and the Nevada col-
lection of Prof. C. F. Baker (481 specimens). Other purchases were
as follows: Plants in the United States (3,223 specimens), viz, Maine
(639), California and Arizona (989), Georgia (497), Ohio (405), Missis-
sippi (693); plants from Central and South America, viz, Mexico (296),
Costa Rica (452), Venezuela (256).

Of the plants transmitted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture
during the year, the most important are the collections of Messrs.
I’, A. Walpole and W. W. Gorman from Alaska (1,323 specimens) and
those of Messrs. F. V. Coville, V. K. Chesnut, David Griffiths, and
others, from Washington, Oregon, and California (1,368 specimens).

WORK ON THE STUDY SERIES.

In the Division of Mammals about 3,000 skulls of small species were
cleaned during the year, two-thirds of which were those belonging to
specimens in the collection of the Biological Survey, U.S. Department
of Agriculture. All the large skulls of the regular Museum series,
with the exception of about 100, have been cleaned, but about 1,500
small skulls still need cleaning. Little could be done toward continu-
ing the rearrangement of the skins of small species for lack of room
and cases, but the work of making over skins which were deteriorating
on account of faulty preparation progressed satisfactorily, about 406
skins having been renovated during the year. It is a cause of much
regret that nothing could be done toward improving the condition of
the large skins in vats and in the cases of the upper laboratory, many
of which are in imminent danger of destruction. ‘There are known to
be from 1,000 to 1,500 of the size of a wolf and upward which need
attention. Some of these are large antelopes and other important
mammals which are now difficult to obtain. The collection of mam-
mals in alcohol was thoroughly overhauled, and is in an excellent con-
dition as regards both preservation and arrangement. The large
storage case behind the wall case in the South Hall, used for the storage
of mammal skulls, was roofed over to exclude dust, and provided with
shelving. It is intended to fit the alcoves with standard racks and
drawers next year for the better installation of the valuable series of
skulls kept there.

The laboratories of the Division of Birds are much overcrowded,
and many devices have to be resorted to in order to accommodate the
collections. It has been found necessary to place different parts of
the collections in rooms widely separated, which greatly increases the
difficulties of administration. Some little improvement was made in
the arrangement of the collection of large birds in the west basement,
but progress was slow on account of insufficient help and space. It is
2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

a satisfaction to report that the Passerine birds, which are the ones
most consulted, are at present well arranged and entirely accessible.
About half the study collection, comprising, perhaps, 65,000 specimens,
is without standard Museum labels, and many of the water birds need
new labels. Some progress in replacing worn out labels was made
during the year.

The condition of the collection of birds’ eggs is very satisfactory.
For a collection of such great size the proportion of perfect specimens
is remarkably large. Considerable progress was made in the rearrange-
ment of both eggs and nests, but more new cases will be required
before it can be completed.

The curator of the Division of Reptilesand Batrachians was without
assistants this year until April, and progress in the rearrangement of
the study series was necessarily slow. A considerable advance has
been made, however,and the collection is now in good condition and
its accessibility increased.

In the Division of Fishes, the principal operation was the prepara-
tion of aseries of 50 sets of specimens for distribution to educational
institutions. These sets average about sixty species each, making a
total of some 3,250 individual specimens in all. Until the staff of this
division is increased, little can be done beyond keeping the collection
from deteriorating.

The study series of mollusks is all in fairly good condition and is
accessible, so that any specimens wanted can be brought to hand ina
few moments. The collection of Naiades was put in perfect order,
and the cataloguing and numbering of the boxes of duplicates brought
up to date. The remainder of the Jeffreys collection of shells is now
most in need of attention. On account of the intricacies of the case
the work can not be done rapidly. As in other divisions the need of
more space is keenly felt.

The great systematic collection of insects of all orders, with the
exception of the Rhynchota, is at present in excellent condition, well
arranged, and accessible to students. The curator of the Division of
Insects, Dr. L. O. Howard, reports as follows on the work of the
division: :

The insect collections are in excellent condition, increasing rapidly in the differ-
ent orders, and all being rearranged in the standard insect drawers, in systematic
order. It is believed, if the same liberality is continued in supplying us with these
standard insect drawers as last year, that the valuable collections in the different
orders will be soon safely secured and permanently rearranged.

The Lepidoptera are now all arranged in these drawers and this order is in excel-
vent shape. This work has been done almost entirely by Doctor Dyar, who deserves
great credit, not only for making many additions to the collection through his friends
and correspondents, but also for putting the collection in such admirable order.

Mr. E. A. Schwarz still continues the rearrangement of the beetles, and during the
past few months has rearranged several families down to the Lampyride. It will,
however, be a long time before this large order can be rearranged, and Mr. Schwarz
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 73

will require many more drawers before his task is completed. In a few days he will
begin arranging the material from the Philippines, West Indies, and South America.

Dr. Ashmead is almost continuously at work on the Hymenoptera, and has rear-
ranged the Chalcidoidea and part of the Cynipoidea. If room No. 3, now occupied by
him, is fitted up with racks to contain standard insect drawers he could, the com-
ing year, rearrange this whole order in these drawers. He considers it important
that this be done immediately to more securely conserve the many hundreds of val-
uable types and cotypes represented in the collection.

The Schmidt boxes, in which many types are still kept, he considers unsafe for
keeping valuable types. Hundreds of types and cotypes are now being sent to us
from all over the world and proper facilities must be provided for the present pres-
ervation of all types intrusted to the Museum.

Mr. Currie still continues his work on the Neuropteroid insects and has made some
important additions to the orders Odonata, Neuroptera, and Trichoptera.

The Orthoptera have been removed to Dr. Dyar’s room and have been rearranged
into the standard insect drawers by Mr. Caudell, who has done much work on these
insects, made large additions of specimens, and is substantially in charge of the order.

Mr. Coquillett also continues his work on the Diptera with indefatigable industry
and has worked up, named, and rearranged several families. The additions to the
family Culicidz, or the mosquitoes, are especially large and noteworthy.

Very little work is being done in the other orders of insects not mentioned,
although Mr. Heidemann finds time to do something occasionally with the Rhynchota.

Our collection of Rhynchota, or bugs (Hemiptera and Homoptera), is large and
valuable, and should be placed immediately in charge of a competent specialist.

In the Division of Marine Invertebrates a special cataloguer was
employed for four months to bring up the cataloguing of the crusta-
ceans, holothurians, etc., which had fallen behind on account of lack of
sufficient clerical assistance. One hundred new sets of duplicate inver-
tebrates were prepared for distribution to accademical establishments.
Some small sets were also prepared to meet special demands. The
extensive collections in alcohol were thoroughly overhauled, the bot-
tles replenished and new labels added where necessary. This impor-
tant part of the zoological collections is now in good condition.
Additional shelving was provided for the collection of anomuran crus-
taceans and worms in the rooms assigned in the north tower of the
Smithsonian building. The Museum benefited by the gratuitous
services of Mr. T. W. Vaughan, of the U. S. Geological Survey, who
rearranged the collection of corals so as to make room for the reception
of recent additions.

The scope of the Section of Helminthological Collections, under the
custodianship of Dr. C. W. Stiles, was enlarged during the year by
the introduction into the catalogues of the collections of the U. 5.
Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service. The collections of the
Division of Zoology, Bureau of Animal Industry, U.S. Department
of Agriculture, are also catalogued in this section of the Museum.

The need of enlarging the quarters for the National Herbarium was
so urgent that the space allotted for an exhibition on the east hall bal-
cony was, as already stated, added -to the laboratory. One hundred
and eleven new standard insect-proof cases were added during the year,
74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

making a total of 225 now in use. About 125 additional cases will be
required to complete the reinstallment of the herbarium, and it is
hoped that these can be provided next year. The Honorary Curator,
Mr. F. V. Coville, reports as follows regarding the work done on the
collections during the year:

During the year we haye added 111 standard insect-proof cases, making 255 now
in use. It is hoped that some 125 new cases will be built during the coming year,
which will about complete the installation of the collection. It will then be ina
better condition than ever before. Very few insects are to be found in our new cases.

At the time the herbarium was actually transferred to the National Museum, July
1, 1894, we began to stamp every herbarium sheet added to the collection. It was
assumed that there were then not less than 200,000 sheets in the herbarium, and the
stamp therefore was set at 200,000. The number of specimens stamped and added to
the herbarium since then is 220,000. Of these 17,055 have been added this year.

The work of recording the old part of the herbarium has almost ceased and speci-
mens are only stamped in cases where they are sent away as a loan. This record
extends from 1 to 27,218. In addition to this, 125,001 to 156,835 have been stamped.

It was decided at the close of the year that all the herbarium sheets
hereafter printed should bear the legend ‘‘ United States National
Museum” as well as the impress of the numbering stamp, which bears
the words ‘* United States National Herbarium.”

Blueprints of the standard herbarium cases adopted by the Museum
were sent by request to the chief of the Insular Bureau of Agriculture,
Manila. :

At the suggestion of Dr. C. W. Stiles the matter of imperfections in
the red labels used inside of receptacles containing type specimens of
animals preserved in liquid was taken up by a special committee.
The committee submitted a report recommending the sole use of
labels printed with a permanent ink containing sulphide of mercury.

LOAN OF COLLECTIONS AND COOPERATION OF SPECIALISTS.

The loan of specimens to specialists in the United States and in
foreign countries for purposes of scientific research continued during
the year as usual. Only the more important transactions of this char-
acter can be noticed in this report. As explained last year, the Museum
usually benefits quite as much by these transactions as the persons who
obtain the-use of the material, as the specimens are studied, identified,
and also quite commonly labeled. The results of the investigations
are sometimes published by the Museum, sometimes by the scientific
organizations to which the specialists belong, and sometimes under
private auspices.

In the Division of Birds, 11 loans were made, comprising 188 speci-
mens. Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural
History, obtained the use of 68 specimens, chiefly shore larks, genus
Otocoris. Forty-five specimens of warblers, genus Dendroica, were
sent to Mr. Joseph Grinnell, of Palo Alto, California, to assist him

in determining the California forms of ). aestiva. Dr. Jonathan
Dwight, jr., obtained the loan of 29 specimens of plovers (genus
Aegialitis) for use in connection with his studies of the molting of
birds. All the lots sent out, with one exception, were returned dur-
ing the year. The loans of mammals were more numerous, amounting
in all to 29 lots, comprising about 300 specimens. Dr. J. A. Allen
obtained the use of 110 specimens of seals and other mammals for use
in his work on the mammals of eastern Siberia. Forty-one specimens
were sent to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn to assist him in the preparation of a
report on the mammals of southern New Mexico and western Texas,
and 14 bats, of the genus Vyct/nomus, for use in identifying bats of that
genus from the Bahama Islands. Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Colum-
bian Museum, borrowed 35 specimens in connection with his work on
Central American mammats. Other loans were chiefly to the scientific
assistants in the Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture. The
majority of the material was returned during the year. The mollusks,
of the family Achatinellidx, loaned to the late Alpheus Hyatt, were
transferred after his death to Prof. A. T. Mayer, who is engaged in
completing the work left unfinished by Professor Hyatt. Of insects,
9 loans were made, the most important being a collection of 626
Orthoptera and Dermaptera, which was sent to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of
Philadelphia. Dr. Philip P. Calvert, of Philadelphia, received 285
specimens of dragon flies (Odonata), and Dr. E. P. Felt, of Albany,
New York, 106 specimens of ophionid hymenoptera. The material
loaned was, for the most part, still in the hands of the specialists at the
close of the year. Of marine invertebrates, exclusive of mollusks, 9
loans were made, 2 of which deserve mention. Prof. H. Coutiére, of
the Ecole Supérieure de Pharmacie, Paris, received the crustaceans of
the family Alpheide collected by the Hawaiian and Samoan expedi-
tions of the Fish Commission steamer A/batross, and also the general
Museum collections of that family for report. All the specimens of
the so-called //olothuria atra were sent to Prof. Charles L. Edwards,
of Trinity College, in connection with his studies of variation. The
stomatopod crustaceans, collected by the staff of the steamer A/batross
in Hawaii and Samoa, were sent to Dr. R. P. Bigelow, of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, who volunteered to report on them.
Three lots of ostracoda were sent to Mr. R. W. Sharpe, of Wilmette,
Illinois, who has undertaken to report on this group for the Museum.

A number of skulls of mammals were sent to Dr. J. M. Ingersoll,
of New York, who is engaged in a comparative study of the sinuses of
the nose. Plants were loaned during the year, chiefly to the botanists
of the Ames Botanical Laboratory, North Easton, Massachusetts, the
Biltmore Herbarium, the Gray Herbarium, Harvard University, the
New York Botanical Garden, and to Dr. C. E. Waters, Mr. Karl W.

MF,

Wiegand, and Mrs. Caroline W. Harris.

6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES.

As already stated, 100 new sets of marine invertebrates from the
duplicate collections, were made up during the year, for distribution
to educational establishments, in accordance with the long-standing
practice of the Museum. Each set contained about 200 specimens,
representing from 92 to 99 species, making in all about 20,000 speci-
mens. During the year 50 of these sets were distributed. About
one-half of them were sent to high schools and other public schools
throughout the United States, and the remainder to various universi-
ties, colleges, normal schools, public libraries, seminaries, academies,
training schools, and science clubs.

About 50 sets of fishes were also made up for distribution.

A series of 60 skins of monkevs, and some other mammals which
were without data as regards localities, etc., and hence of no especial
value in the study collection of the Division of Mammals, were dis-
tributed to four colleges. which signified their desire to make use of
the material in teaching.

LABORATORY USE OF COLLECTIONS BY INVESTIGATORS.

The collections of mammals, birds, insects and plants were frequently
consulted by the naturalists of the U. S$. Department of Agriculture,
as in previous years. Mrs. Vernon Bailey pursued studies of birds in
connection with her book on birds of the Western United States.
Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, examined the collections of neotropi-
val birds, and the committee on nomenclature, of the American Orni-
thologists Union, examined a large amount of material for the purpose
of ascertaining, as in past years, the status of newly described North
American species. The series of Old World chameleons was studied
by Mr. Thomas Barber, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has in
preparation a monographic work on these reptiles. In an endeavor
to establish the real status of the snake, knownas Tropidonotus erythro-
gaster, Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College, Michigan, made compari-
sons of specimens in the Museum. Comparisons of insects were made
by the following entomologists: Prof. John B. Smith (Noctuidae),
Dr. W. J. Holland (Moths), Dr. J. A. G. Rehn (Orthoptera), Mr. J. C.
Bradley (parasitic hymenoptera and sawflies), Mr. H. H. Ballou
(Specidae). Dr. Walter Horn, of Berlin, Germany, examined the
collections of Coleoptera and identified some of the exotic material.
He spoke highly of the work of the late Martin L. Linell, who was for
many years an aid in the Division of Insects.

As for some years past, Dr. N. L. Britton, director of the New York
Botanical Garden, was a frequent visitor to the herbarium. During
the past year he was principally interested in studying the Crassula-
ceae. Dr. E. L. Greene spent much time in reviewing certain of the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. (fp
Papaveraceae, and Mr. Theodor Holm, the Carices. Dr. L. M. Under-
wood, of Columbia University, examined the collections of ferns.

Inquiries were received from Stanford University concerning the
methods of cataloguing and labeling employed in the Department, and
were answered as fully as circumstances would permit.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES AND PUBLICATIONS.

This very important branch of the work of the Department, the founda-
tion, indeed, and the final aim of all its other activities, was carried on with
no less ardor than in previous years. The segregation of work on the
exhibition series, explained in a preceding page, left the scientific
staff somewhat more time in which to pursue investigations, while the
activity of systematists in various parts of the country, involving the
use of the Government collections, showed no abatement.

It is only possible in this place to mention some of the more impor-
tant investigations carried on by the members of the scientific staff of
the Museum. A complete list of all papers based on the Museum col-
lections published by the staff for the year will be found in Appendix II
of this volume. It is interesting to note that the articles exceed 150
in number, and appeared in about thirty different journals, including
the following: Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum, Bulletin of
the U. S. National Museum, Proceedings of the Biological Society of
Washington, Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, Science Yearbook of the Carnegie Institution, The Auk,
Naturen, Nautilus, American Journal of Pharmacy, Journal of Con-
chology, Smithsonian Report, Biographical Memoirs of the National
Academy of Sciences, Canadian Entomologist, Journal of the New
York Entomological Society, Psyche, Proceedings of the Entomolog-
ical Society of Washington, Entomological News, Transactions of the
Entomological Society, Country Life in America, Bulletin of the
Museum of Comparative Zoology, Zoologischer Anzeiger, Public
Health Report, Report of the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. 8.
Department of Agriculture, American Medicine, Bulletin of the
Hygienic Laboratory, U. 8. Public Health Service, Journal of Com-
parative Medicine, Contributions from the National Herbarium, Annats
of Botany, Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Plant World, and
Fern Bulletin.

The second volume of Mr. Robert Ridgway’s extensive manual of
North and Central American birds, containing 854 pages of text and
22 plates, was published during the year. It deals with the families
of Tanagers, Troupials, Honey Creepers, and Wood Warblers (Tana-
grid, Icteridee, Coerebidee, and Mniotiltide), comprising 77 genera
and 433 species and subspecies.

The preparation of the third volume, covering 15 families, was in an
advanced stage at the close of the year, about 400 pages being already
78 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

in type. Dr. Charles W. Richmond’s paper on the birds collected by
Doctor Abbott and Mr. C. B. Kloss in the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands was published by the Museum during the year. Doctor
Richmond spent considerable time in identifying the Abbott collection
of birds for the west coast of Sumatra and in working up a collection
from the South Pacific. He continued work on the card catalogue of
the genera and species of birds. ‘Two papers on South American birds
in the Museum collection, by Mr. H. C. Oberholser, appeared during
the year, and also one by Dr. W. K. Fisher on a new tern from the
Hawaiian Islands. Dr. William L. Ralph continued the preparation
of material for a supplementary volume on the life histories of North
American birds, with special reference to their nests and eggs, to com-
plete the important work left unfinished by the death of Major C. E.
Bendire.

Dr. L. Stejneger completed his study of the reptiles of Porto Rico,
and handed the manuscript in for publication in November. It is
hoped that means will be found for its publication at an early date.
When the year closed he was still engaged in the investigation of the
herpetological fauna of eastern Asia. Papers by Doctor Stejneger on
Holbrook’s salamander and on the reptiles of the Huachuca Moun-
tains, Arizona, were published by the Museum during the year.

In accordance with the arrangement made with President D. S.
Jordan, the Museum published during the year 14 papers on Japanese
fishes, prepared by himself and conjointly with other ichthyologists.
Two papers on the osteology of fishes, by Mr. E. C. Starks, were pub-
lished, and a brief paper by Dr. Theodore Gill on the use of the name
‘* torpedo.”

in connection with an extensive work on the Tertiary mollusks
of Florida, Dr. W. H. Dall prepared reviews of the recent mollusks
of the groups Veneride, Carditacea, Cyrenacea, and Astartide. Dr.
Bartsch continued work on the Pyramidellidae, and had nearly com-
pleted the investigation at the close of the year.

The researches carried on by Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., had for their
principal object the elucidation of Doctor Abbott’s collections of East
Indian mammals. As stated on a previous page, he found in the col-
lection studied 17 new species of mouse deer, genus Tragulus, and 16
new species in other orders, together with a new genus, Lenothriv.
In going over the Museum collection of American bats, he detected 20
undescribed species, diagnoses of which are published in the Proceed-
ings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He also pre-
pared a number of notes on different species of bats and rodents.
Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, made a study of the ocelots in the
Museum collection and in other collections, the results of which were
published in September, 1902, as Proceedings paper No. 1286. Dr.
M. W. Lyon, jr., completed and handed in for publication his list of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

type specimens of mammals, exclusive of cetaceans, in the collections
of the Museum. As photographs of the types are to be prepared, this
catalogue has not yet been published. It records the presence of type
specimens, or type material, of 469 species and subspecies. (This is
exclusive of the type specimens in the collection of the Biological
Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture, which are probably at least
as many.) Dr. Lyon has also pursued investigations relative to the
osteology of the rabbits, and published two brief notes on other mam-
mals. The Head Curator completed his comparison of North American
and European species of whalebone whales, and toward the close of
the year submitted a manuscript of about 1,000 pages, with 50 plates.
He also prepared papers on Dr. Philippi’s species of Chilean porpoises,
on a killer whale stranded on the coast of Maine, and on a species of
Prodelphinus obtained at Honolulu; and notes on the name of the com.
mon porpoise of the genus Zursiops, and on the occurrence of the
pollack whale, Balenoptera borealis, in American waters.

Doctor Ashmead continued his study of the classification of the
Chaleid flies, which was in course of publication by the Carnegie
Museum at the close of the year, and a series of papers on the wasps
of the groups Vespoidea, Proctotrypoidea, and Cynipoidea, was pub-
lished in the Canadian Entomologist and other entomological journals.
He continued work on his monographs of North America Braconidee, a
Philippine Hymenoptera, Japanese Hymenoptera, and also a catalogue
of North American Hymenoptera. Mr. D. W. Coquillett was occupied
in identifying and arranging the Diptera, and completed a revision of
the genera of the family Empidide. A paper by him describing four
new genera and 94 new species of North America diptera appeared in
the Museum Proceedings in September, 1902. Mr. Nathan Banks
published 16 papers on spiders and on other subjects of a more general
character. A paper on dragon flies, and one on ant lions, by Mr. R. P.
Currie, were published by the Entomological Society of Washington
during the year. Mr. Currie continued work on a catalogue of
North American Neuropteroid insects, and on a monograph of the ant
lions. Mr. August Busck published 2 papers on the codling moth,
and one on a new species of the family Yponomentidae. His revision
of the American moths of the family Gelechiidae was published by the
Museum during the year. The Museum Proceedings for the year also
contained a paper by Dr. H. G. Dyar on the larva of moths from
Colorado, and an additional section of Dr. John B. Smith’s monograph
of the moths of the family Noctuidae. Dr. J. E. Benedict published
descriptions of new species of Galatheidae, and completed a revision of
the genus Lepidopa, and descriptions of other new Albuneidae. He
also engaged in the study of the anomuran crabs from Japan and the
Hawaiian Islands, collected by the Albatross, some new crabs of the
family Dromidae, and some interesting annelids. Miss M. J. Rathbun
80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

continued work on a monograph of the fresh-water crabs, based on the
collections of the National Museum, the Muséum d’ Histoire Naturelle,
Paris, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, and
other institutions. She also published five short papers on crusta-
ceans during the year, one of which, describing new Hawaiian crabs,
appeared in the Museum Proceedings. Dr. Harriet Richardson pub-
lished descriptions of two new isopods. Two papers on crustaceans
collected in and near Mammoth Cave and Nickajack Cave, by Prof.
W. P. Hay, were published by the Museum.

Dr. Charles B. Wilson completed his study of the collection of
North American copepod crustaceans of the family Argulide, the
results of which were published by the Museum as Proceedings paper
No. 1302. It occupies 107 pages, and includes a review of all the
species of the family and a bibliography, and is accompanied by 20
plates.

Dr. C. W. Stiles, Custodian of Helminthological Collections, made
an extended investigation of a parasitic disease prevalent among the
people of the Southern States, which he found to be due to the attacks
of a new species of hookworm, Uncinaria americana. Healso carried
on investigations regarding frequency of the occurrence of parasites
in men. He published nine papers relating to parasitology during
the year and three others along the same line conjointly with Dr.
Albert Hassall and Mr. Charles A. Pfender; also the first three parts
of an index catalogue of medical and veterinary zoology, Doctor Has-
sall being a coauthor. The staff of the National Herbarium was too
fully occupied during the year with routine work and the rearrange-
ment of the collections to devote a great deal of time to investigations.
A third section of Doctor Rose’s studies of Mexican and Central
American plants was published, and a paper in joint authorship with
Mr. W. B. Hemsley on the genus Ju/iania. He continued work on
the Crassulaceze of North America conjointly with Doctor Britton,
and completed a preliminary paper relating to that group of plants.
Mr. C, L. Pollard published a number of notes in the Plant World,
and described two new violets from the United States. He also pub-
lished conjointly with Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell descriptions of four
new plants from new Mexico. Mr. W. R. Maxon continued studies on
the Museum collection of ferns, and Mr. Edward 8. Steele completed
a monograph of the genus Lacinaria.

EXPOSITIONS.

As stated in the last report, a part of the collections displayed at
the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, 1901, were later transferred
to the Charleston Exposition, which closed May 31, 1902. The
exhibit made at the latter place was returned to Washington in June.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81

In the meantime preparations were begun for the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition, St. Louis, 1904. The schedule of exhibits for this expo-
sition, approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
includes the display of a series of specimens of the large game mam-
mals of the world, the cast of an adult sulphur-bottom whale (the
largest existing animal), a series of the largest and most attractive
birds, such as the ostriches, pheasants, birds of paradise, etc.; large
reptiles, such as the crocodiles, alligators, boas, pythons, cobras, and
the like; aseries of models of deep-sea fishes; a systematic series of
invertebrates, arranged with the special view of illustrating modern
methods of museum installation and labeling; a series of the eggs of
vertebrates; a collection of butterflies. An exhibit from the National
Herbarium, and some minor exhibits, will probably be decided upon
later. A representation of the Children’s Room, showing the methods
to interest children in the study of animate nature, will also be made.

A report on the Pan-American Exposition was submitted during this
year, and will be found in the Assistant Secretary’s report for 1900-
1901, pp. 177 to 231. The Head Curator, having been in charge of
the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum at
the Charleston Exposition, also submitted a report in that connection
which will be found in the Assistant Secretary’s report for 1901-2,
». 165 and 166.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1902-3.

By Grorce P. MERRILL,
Head Curator.

The year that has just closed compares very favorably with those
immediately preceding, both as to the number and value of the acces-
sions. The Department is to be particularly congratulated on acquiring
the Rominger and Sherwood collections of vertebrate and invertebrate
fossils; another large portion of the Ulrich collection, and three entire
meteorites from Kentucky and North Carolina, as noted below. The
fine example of the Shergotty, India, meteorite, secured through
the courtesy of Dr. T. H. Holland, and a fragment of the celebrated
diamond-bearing meteorite from Novo Urei, Russia, are also worthy of
mention.

ACCESSIONS.

The total number of accessions received by the Department is shown
in tabular form below, those for 1900-1901 and 1901-2 being also
given for purposes of comparison:

DIVISION OF MINERALOGY.

1. A collection of some 200 specimens of minerals from various
American localities, received from the U. 8. Geological Survey at the
close of the Pan-American and Charleston expositions. Conspicuous
in this series are the fine tourmalinitic quartzes from Little Pipestone
district, Montana, the larger being some 2 feet in length and coated on
one side with a parallel growth of small, richly-colored amethysts.
A second example is a crystal of smoky quartz some 18 inches in
length, with good terminations, but broken across the bottom so as to
show the sagenitic black tourmaline. The series also contains several
cross sections of crystals, 3 or more inches in diameter, showing
to good advantage the zonal arrangement of the quartz and tourma-
line; also a very complete series of aurichalcites and specimens of the
comparatively rare minerals coloradoite and melonite, as well as fine
tourmalines from California, endlichite from New Mexico, quartz
from North Carolina and New York, parisite from Montana, cinnabar
from Utah and California, fluorite from New Hampshire, gothite from
Colorado, melanotekite from New Mexico, barite from Colorado,

86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.
SECTION OF INVERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY.

1. A collection of some 1,200 species (75,000 specimens) of bryozoa
and 2,500 thin sections, from the E. O. Ulrich collection.

2, The Carl Rominger collection of Mississippi Valley Paleozoic
invertebrates. This consists largely of corals (many of which are
figured and described in the reports of the Geological Survey of
Michigan), crinoids, and mollusks, representing not less than 14,000
specimens.

3. The Andrew Sherwood collection of Pennsylvania Upper Devonie
vertebrate and invertebrate fossils. This contains many choice slabs
filled with large brachiopods and mollusca, besides about 3,000 small
specimens.

4. Collections of trilobites with limbs (7Zrzarthrus beck/) studied by
Doctor Walcott and described in the Proceedings of the Biological
Society of Washington, 1894; of Little Metis sponges, and some
twenty boxes of Paleozoic fossils, from the U.S. Geological Survey.

5. One large slab containing 18 fine specimens of melonites and some
135 labeled specimens from the Marcellus limestone; received from
Dr. C. E. Beecher, of Yale University.

SECTION OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY.

1. Casts of mandibular rami; teeth of Mastodon humboldti and Mas-
todon cordillerum, veceived fromthe British Museum.

2. Cast of egg of Himeus crassus.

3. Reptilian footprints in sandstone, from Mount Carbon, Penn-
sylvania.

4. A tooth (type) of Cladodus formosus, from Needle Mountains
quadrangle, Colorado; collected by Whitman Cross.

SECTION OF PALEOBOTANY.

1. Kighty-three specimens of Paleozoic plants, from the Ulrich
collection.

2. A small series of fossil plants, from the Permian of Ohio.

3. Four hundred and eighty-eight specimens of Triassic plants, from
Connecticut and Massachusetts; received from the U. S. Geological
Survey.

ROUTINE.

During the year under consideration the geographic exhibit of
economic minerals in the southwest court has been largely overhauled
and cases and specimens cleaned and rearranged. The collection of non-
metallic minerals on the baleony has likewise undergone rearrange-
ment. ‘The case containing the stratigraphic and historical collections,
against the south wall in the west-south range, has been entirely recon-
structed and the collections reinstalled. In the course of this work
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87
some 2,500 blocks constructed on a new plan were introduced. These
are made of a tripartate veneering and only about one-fourth inch in
thickness.

In six floor upright exhibition cases and one wall-case, double doors
have been replaced by single, thus more than doubling the size of the
glass. The improvement is so great as to suggest the advisability of
carrying out the work in all the cases of this type.

The collections on the west front of the Museum have been over-
hauled and many specimens removed to storage, whereby the appear-
ance of the west front is considerably improved. The work has, as
usual, been done under the direct supervision of Mr. Newhall.

Manuscript for about 1,300 labels has been prepared and sent to the
Government Printer. Upward of 6,000 specimen and reference cards
have also been prepared, and an equal number of specimens numbered.

The work of preparing the type catalogue has progressed but slowly,
only about 300 slips having been written. The large influx of new and
especially type material, has made it seem advisable to postpone the
immediate publication of this list. This work, together with the gen-
eral stenographic and clerical work of the department, has remained
in the hands of Mrs. Jouy and Miss Graves.

In the section of invertebrate paleontology a large amount of work
has been done in arranging the new materials, particularly those of
the E. O. Ulvich collection. During the year there were identified or
placed in final museum condition upward of 16,000 specimens. These
are recorded in the registers, but, on account of lack of clerical help,
have not been numbered, nor have cards been made for the card
catalogue.

Dr. Peale reports that work on the paleobotanical series has con-
tinued along the same lines as last year. The exhibition series has been
partially rearranged and new labels have been printed and exchanged
for the temporary labels of the Paleozoic portion of the collection.

Work in the section of vertebrate paleontology has proceeded but
slowly, owing to the small force engaged. Mr. Stewart has been at
work during almost the entire year upon a mount of the Claosaurus.
The work is now nearly completed, and it is expected that during the
coming fall this very interesting vertebrate fossil will be placed on
exhibition in the southeast court. The hind limb of a Brontosaurus
has been prepared and placed on exhibition during the time under
consideration.

No explorations have been carried on during the year at the expense
of the Museum. Messrs. Schuchert and Bassler and the Head Curator
have been in the field on various occasions, but either at their own
expense or that of other organizations. Much valuable material has
thus been obtained.
88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

EXCHANGES AND LOANS.

There have been sent out from the Division of Geology during this
period, to various individuals and students, some 1,262 individual
specimens and 1,288 pounds of miscellaneous material—this entirely
aside from such materials as are ordinarily loaned for study and inves-
tigation. For the last-named purposes there have been loaned during
the year, from the Division of Geology:

To T. Nelson Dale, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 6 specimens of roofing
slates and thin sections.

To George I. Adams, U. S. Geological Survey, 9 specimens of
gypsum.

To George F. Barker, University of Pennsylvania, 3 specimens of
uraninite.

From the Division of Mineralogy, material has been furnished to
the Chemical and Physical Department of the U. 8. Geological Sur-
vey, to the Division of Roads of the Department of Agriculture, and to
the Bureau of Soils of the same Department. Samples of the Putnam
County, Georgia, and Admire, Kansas, meteorites were sent to Dr.
EK. Cohen, Greifswald, Germany, for use in his researches on meteoric
iron.

From the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology there were loaned
to Dr. C. K. Beecher 43 specimens of Upper Carboniferous insects.
To A. W. Grabau, Columbia University, 8 crinoids.. To Dr. M. Coss-
mann, Paris, 16 Cretaceous gastropods. To Prof. 8. W. Williston,
University of Chicago, 257 specimens of Tertiary insects. To Dr.
John M. Clarke, State paleontologist, Albany, New York, a large lot
of Lower Silurian graptolites; and to the Royal Austrian Museum
(Dr. Handlirsch), 562 Carboniferous insects.

Portions of collections in the section of vertebrate paleontology
have been studied by Dr. E. C. Case, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Prof.
S. W. Williston, University of Chicago; Dr. J. B..Hatcher, Carnegie
Museum, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the Amer-
ican Museum of Natural History in New York City; and Dr. John
M. Clarke, State paleontologist of New York.

The paleobotanical collections, as usual, have been continually
available to the paleobotanists of the U. S. Geological Survey. In
addition, Dr. Arthur Hollick, of the New York Botanical Gardens,
has on several occasions visited the Museum in connection with his
work on the island series of the Upper Cretaceous.

PRESENT CONDITION OF COLLECTIONS.

It may be safely stated that, as a whole, the collections are in better
condition than ever before. The improvement has been constant, and
though not as rapid as one could wish, is fairly satisfactory—perhaps
as satisfactory as can be expected in the present building. Naturally
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 89

there must be a constant weeding out of old material and the insertion
of new in order that the collections may be kept up to date, but expan-
sion alone any lines other than that of vertebrate paleontology is
practically prohibited through lack of space. The work which is now
being done in connection with preparations for the Louisiana Pur-
chase Exposition will, on the assumption that the collections return to
us in safety, fill the halls to their utmost extent, and it will unques-
tionably be necessary to store a considerable amount of less desirable
material.

Mention may be made here of the mounted skeleton of the Church,
Michigan, mastodon, collected by Mr. Alban Stewart in the spring of
1901, which is now in an adyanced state of preparation. This gives
the Museum its first complete mounted representative of this interest-
ing group of quadrupeds.

The acquisition for the workshops of a one-half horsepower motor
with flexible shaft and fittings for drilling and cutting, and a ‘‘Jenny
Lind” polisher, together with a renewal of the large grinding bed and
the remodeling of the reciprocating stone saw, have greatly facilitated
the work of the preparators.

The work of the year, as on previous occasions, has been compli-
cated by preparation for an exposition.

RESEARCH.

Various influences have prevented the Head Curator from taking an
active part in research in connection with the Museum collections.
Numerous brief papers have been published, but as they were not, for
the most part, based upon Museum materials, they need not be men-
tioned here.

In connection with Mr. Tassin, investigations have been made upon
the meteorite collections, but the results as yet are far from ready for
publication.

The Head Curator has in course of preparation a work upon the
History of American Geology. This is as yet so far from complete
as to need no special notice at this time.

Mr. Schuchert has continued his studies on Lower Devonie fossils,
as reported last year. A report to be published by the Geological
Survey of Maryland on this subject is progressing satisfactorily, and
it is expected will be ready for the printer some time during the com-
ing year.

Mr. Schuchert has also completed a study of the Cystidea of the
Manlius and Coeymans formations. The paper is about ready for pub-
lication.

Mr. R. S. Bassler has in preparation studies on the Bryozoa and
Ostracoda. A paper reviewing the entire Bryozoa of the Rochester
shales will, it is expected, be completed during the coming winter.
90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Mr. Phalen has made a study of rocks collected by Messrs. Schuchert
and White in Greenland in 1897.

Papers by members of the U. 8. Geological Survey upon materials
in the section of paleobotany are noted in the bibliography.

The personnel of the Department remains the same as last year. Mr.
J. W. Coleman, skilled laborer in the section of vertebrate paleon-
tology, who had been away on leave of absence, returned to work on
September 19, 1902, but finally severed his connection with the
Museum during the latter part of June.

General history of

The story of a word—Mammal.
Pop. Sci. Monthly, LX1, Sept., 1902, pp. 434—
438.

The etymology and singular form of the
word Mammalia have been erroneously given
in all dictionaries as derived from the Latin
adjective mammalis and as cognate with vari-
ous words in living European languages. It
is contended that the name was first given by
Linneeus in 1758, and that he formed it in
analogy with Animalia and derived it directly
from the noun Mamma and added the suffix
-alia. A history of the use of the word is
given.

The first use of Mammals and

Mammalians.
Science (new series), Xvi, No. 417, Dec. 26,
1902, pp. 1034-1035.

The earliest use of the word Mammals seems
to have been made by Good in 1818 in the
Pantalogia, and that of Mammalians by Kirby
in 1835 in his Bridgewater treatise.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The hosts of Argulids

and their nomenclature. |
Science (new series), XVII, No. 418, Jan. 2,
1903, p. 33.

The names of the fish-hosts of many of the
species described in the ‘‘ Monograph of North
American Parasitic Copepods of the family
Argulide,” by C. B. Wilson, are corrected
and the fishes identified.

The bones of the shoulder girdle
of fishes.

Science (new series), XviI, No. 424, Feb.
13, 1903, pp. 255-256.

The most characteristic system of bones of
the pisciform vertebrates is manifest in the
shoulder girdle, and the classes of selachians
and typical fishes, or teleostomes, have been
segregated under the name Lyrifera, on ac-
count of the character of this girdle. The
consideration of the bones, however, mili-
tates decidedly against the acceptance of the
views generally held. Secapula and coracoid
were given originally to the composite bone
and its process familiar from manifestation
in man. The bones of fishes to which the
names have been given are certainly not ho-
mologous. They,in fact, are only developed
as such in fishes specialized as teleosts and
very remote from the primitive stock of the
terrestrial vertebrates. A special nomencla-
ture is therefore necessary. The so-called
scapula has been designated as hypercoracoid,
the coracoid as hypocoracozd, and the Span-
genstuck, or precoracoid, as mesocoracoid.
The mesocoracoid disappears in most fishes;
all the acanthopterygians and offshoots from
that stock being deprived oi that ossicle.

fish genus Lampris.

13, 1903, pp. 256-257.

Recently the foremost ichthyologist of Eu-
rope, Doctor Boulenger, reexamined the
osteology of Lampris, and especially the
shoulder girdie, and attained novel concep-
tions as to the athnities of that genus. The
number oO! bones in the shoulder girdle of
Lampris is the same as in ordinary acanthop-
teryglan fishes, but two of them haye been
interpreted trom a different standpoint than
by his predecessors. (1) The very large bone
which occupies the lower and posterior part
ot the girdle was considered by him to be a
peculiar bone, named interclayicle, and
homologized with a homonymous bone of the
hemibranchs, and (2) the smaller one imme-
diately above it and behind the bones sup-
porting the pectoral fin was regarded as a
“eoracoid’’ or hypocoracoid. Therefore he
considered it as the representative not only
ota pecuhar family (Lampridid), but of an
independent higher group named Selenich-
thyes and coordinated with the Hemibranchii
and Lophobranchii, the three being associated
together as representatives of a suborder to

which the new name Catosteomi was given.
To test this conclusion the skeleton of Lampris
was submitted to renewed examination.
That examination forced the author to ac-
ceptance of the principal ideas of the older
ichthyologists; four actinosts, or pterygials,
are recognized, and the coracoid of Boulenger
is identified with the fourth. The hypocora-
coid is found in the interclavicle of Boulen-
ger. Asa consequence, the genus is restored
to the group of acanthopterygians. Never-
theless, the differences between Lampris and
all other fishes are sufliciently great to entitle
it to rank as the type of a family (Lampridi-
dee), as well as a special superfamily (Lam-
pridoidea).

Origin of the name Monotremes.

Science (new series), XVII, No. 428, Mar.

13, 1903, pp. 433-434.

It is shown that the name Monotremes was
given by E. Geoffroy as an ordinal designation
(in French form only) in 1803, the order
(ordre) diagnosed, and the genera ‘ Orni-
thorhinchus’’ and ‘‘Echidna”’ referred to it.

Homologies of the anterior limb.
Science (new series), XVII, No. 430, Mar.
27, 1903, p. 489.

It is contended that Polypterus gives us a
key to the problem in question, as has been
already urged by the writer in 1872, 1878, and
1882. This view, after long neglect, was
independently urged later by others, especi-
ally Emery and Pollard, but with differences
of detail. The humerus, radius, ulna, carpal,
and metacarpal bones are found in a recog-
nizable condition in Polypterus. That genus
is the nearest o1 the living fishes in relation-
ship to the amphibians and consequently all
terrestrial vertebrates

In refutation of Mr. Henry W. Fowler’s

it is demonstrated, by an analysis of his treat-

Remarks on the attitude of Linnzeus with

Reference is made to various fish names
used in Brickell’s ‘‘ Natural History of North
Carolina,’ published in 1737. The story of
the devilfish running away with a ‘vessel
fora league or two’ isrepeated. Information
is asked if certain names are still used for
fishes, viz, ‘‘Sea-Tench’’ for the Tautog,
“ Welchmen’”’ for black basses, and ‘' Irish-
men”’ for crappies.

that the first edition had been discontinued

however, found a copy of a fourth volume in

with considerations on its bearing on nomen-
clature. The volume appears to have been
suppressed.

The conclusion is that the skeleton, so far
as the physical characteristics are concerned,
is practically identical in type with that of
the modern Indian of the same region and
presents no indications of any great antiquity.

The John Day basin lies in north central
Oregon between the north and south ranges
of the Blue Mountains, covering an area of
approximately 10,000 square miles, drained by
the John Day River and its tributaries. The
flora of the basin, as set forth in this paper,
comprises 150 forms distributed among 37
natural families and the anomalous group of
Phyllites. Of the 150 forms enumerated, 24
have not been specifically named, and 44
species and one variety are described as new,
the previously known species numbering 81.
The beds are allof Tertiary age, ranging from
Lower Eocene to Upper Miocene. The con-
ditions prevailing in the John Day basin in
Tertiary times extended into central Wash-
ington, northwestern Idaho, and western

Oregon.

The present part of this monograph deals
with four exclusively American families of
Passeres (Tanagride, Icteride, Ccerebide,
and Mniotiltidz), embracing 77 genera and
433 species and subspecies. The treatment of
species is similar to that followed in the first
part of the work. Brief descriptions of the
known plumages are given, followed by
measurements, the geographical ranges, and
a full synonymy. The following forms are
introduced as new: Phenicothraupis rubica
nelsoni (p. 145), Compsothlypis americana ra-

(Pub-

malinz (p. 486), Geothlypis incompta (p. 677),

thickness of 3,169 feet. These formations are
followed by the Lower Deyonic deposits, with
a thickness of 608 feet (Helderbergian, 260
feet, and Oriskanian, 348 feet). The yarious
formations are based on fossil content as fixed
by the New York series, are of the North At-

sion of study of eggs. (Editorial. )
Osprey, 1V, No. 1, Sept., 1899, pp. 9-10.

The desirability of extending the study of

eggs beyond their shells is urged. The in-

vestigations of Valenciennes and Frémy on

the contents of the egg, published in 1854, are

referred to, and the difference between the

reaction to boiling is indicated in the case of

the albumen of the Lapwing. Dataare asked

for as ‘‘to the absolute and relative time re-
quired by the white and yellow to become |

hard in boiling, the degree of hardness ac-
quired, and the behavior of white and yellow
to reagents.”? It is also added that ‘‘the edi-
bility and taste of eggs of different kinds would
also be interesting subjects for inyestigation.”’

The opinion of J. E. Harting that the Dinor-
nis maximus was ‘the largest known bird
that had ever lived”’ is noted. The Thrasae-
tus harpyia, or Harpy Eagle, is declared to be
apparently the largest bird of prey, weighing
28 to 30 pounds. Attention is called to the
overlooked fact that the common Turkey
may be ‘‘the largest bird that flies,’ as it
sometimes may exceptionally attain a weight
of 70 pounds. Such a turkey, howeyer, could
seareely fly.

(editorial. )
Osprey, Iv, No. 6, Feb., 1900, pp. 90-91.

A continuation of a former editorial article
on the same subject, in which the land shell-
bearing Gasteropods are considered. The
conclusion is reached that ‘“‘the extent of
differentiation and segregation of the pre-
dominant Achatinellines almost compels us
to believe that their progenitors came upon
the islands very early. With the present fee-
ble light to guide us, it seems to be more
likely that these progenitors came from the
west of the islands.”’ This is in contrast with
the indications furnished by the birds as at
present understood. Weare thus left in an
unsettled condition, and must await future
more detailed studies.

An abstract of ‘‘a communication to the
National Academy of Sciences made April 18,
1900.” It is contended that the African fauna
“has two sides, facing in opposite directions,
and it can not be understood without taking
both into consideration.’’ The association of
Africa with Asia or Europe is ‘illogical and
falsifies the record.’ ‘Whatever facts a
classification may be intended to embody,
the African fauna must be isolated. If we
wish to express, in our terminology, a former
condition of affairs, Eogeea is a term adapted
to do so.”

Significance and etymology of the
word mammal.
Osprey, Iv, No. 10, June, 1900, pp. 157-159.
The etymology imagined in the Century
Dictionary and others is shown to be errone-
ous. The name mammaliais declared to haye
been formed by Linneus in analogy with
Animalia, from the word mamma with the
suffix alia. The singular, consequently,
should be mammal and not mammale. The
history of the anglicized form mammal and
Mammifer is also indicated.

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xxi1I, No. 1234,
June 6, 1901, 735-788.

The name Heptatrema is traced back to its
origin and the history of the nomenclature of
the genus detailed. It is shown that the
earliest name was Eptatretus (1819) and that
consequently the family name should be
Eptatretidz.

Note on the genus Hollandia of

Karsh.
Science (mew series), x11, June 14, 1901,
pp. 949-950.

The name Hollandia, haying been applied
in 1892 to one genus, could not be given to a
second, and consequently the genus of but-
terflies named Hollandia by Karsch in 1897
isrenamed Hollandella. The family Holan-
diidx is degraded to the rank of a subfamily

named Hollandelline.

Nomenclature at Berlin.
Osprey, V, No. 8, Aug., 1901, pp. 126-127.
Comments are made on some of the rules
promulgated by the recent Zoological Con-
gress at Berlin, as well as certain names pub-
lished by French ornithologists. The criti-
cized names are such as were formed by
“compounding the first part or syllables of
one word and the final elements of another,”
such as Embernagea composed of Ember [iza]
and [7a]nagra.

Alewives.
Notes and Queries (9), vi1I, No. 206, Noy.
30, 1901, pp. 451-452.

In answer to a previous inquiry (Vol. vm,
p. 406) the etymology and true name of the
American Alewife are given. In correction
of the great New England Dictionary it is re-
marked that Alewife was and still isa name
applied in some places in England to one of
the Shads, and quite naturally it was brought
over to the United States by the immigrants
from England. Aloofe, given as an etymon
and an Indian name, is nothing but Aloose,
the antique s haying been mistaken for an f.
Aloose, Alose, and Alice, as well as Alewife,
are derivatives from the old Latin Alosa.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE BUILDINGS OCCUPIED BY THE
NATIONAL COLLECTIONS.

Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge 6f the U.S. National Museum.

INTRODUCTION.

The object of this paper is to briefly describe the history and
character of the several buildings in which the science and art collec-
tions belonging to this Government have been housed and cared for,
the time for such an account seeming especially opportune, in view of
the recent beginning of an additional, larger, and more elaborate
structure to meet the demands for increased space. No attempt is
made to contrast the present accommodations with those provided
elsewhere for a like purpose, only such criticisms being offered as
are directly suggested by the buildings themselves.

The scope of the U.S. National Museum, as defined by acts of
Congress, is exceedingly broad, including, besides natural history,
geology, archeology and ethnology, the various arts and industries of
man. Its development, resulting largely from Government explora-
tions, has been greatest in the four subjects first mentioned. The
collections illustrating the industrial arts, though now mainly in
storage, are nearly as extensive in the amount of exhibition space
required, and they can be rapidly enlarged and perfected as soon as
a place is found for them.

Since the seventh decade of the last century the Museum has been
continuously in a state of congestion, and with ever increasing acces-
sions, it early became necessary to resort to outside storage, in which
the amount of material is now extremely large. The demand for
additional room, therefore, dates back over twenty years, being based
partly on the need of placing these valuable collections under safe
conditions and partly on the important requirement of bringing them
into service by classification and arrangement. Last year an impor-
tant step in this direction was realized—the passage of an act of Con-
gress under which a more commodious and worthy building will

speedily be secured.
181
182 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 19903.

As to the suitability for museum purposes of the existing buildings
it may be said that the Smithsonian building was erected before
much was known of museum needs, and it was moreover designed
only in part for museum use. Its publie halls, though exhibiting
many important defects, have as a whole served their purpose well.
The accommodations for laboratories and the storage of reserve collee-
tions are, on the other hand, very poor, being mainly found in base-
ment and small tower rooms, inconvenient and badly lighted.

The Museum building, constructed soon after the Centennial Exhi-
bition of 1876, primarily for the extensive collections brought to
Washington from that source, was put up hastily and cheaply, and
therefore not as substantially as was advisable. It is practically one
great exhibition hall, since its partition walls are pierced at frequent
intervals with broad and high arched openings. The lighting in the
main is not unsatisfactory, though with a different roof construction it
could be much improved. Here again, however, fault is to be found
with the space available for workrooms and storerooms, since, having
practically no basement, these rooms are confined to the towers and
pavilions.

In planning the new granite building an opportunity is offered for
correcting these faults. Good and convenient laboratories and storage
rooms have been provided for, and it is intended that the exhibition
halls shall show a decided improvement over those in the older
structures.

The history of the buildings is briefly as follows:

In 1840 a society was organized in the city of Washington under the
name of the National Institution, afterwards changed to the National
Institute, among whose objects was the direction of the Smith-
son bequest, then under discussion by Congress, and the bringing
together of collections in natural history, ethnology, and such other
subjects as fall within the scope of a general museum. Its member-
ship included many prominent persons, among them members of the
Government and of Congress, which gave to the society a recognized
position and secured to its purposes extensive quarters in the building
of the Patent Office. Here were assembled the many valuable speci-
mens brought home by the famous United States Exploring Expedition
around the world, as well as others derived from both Government
and private sources, which formed the nucleus of the present national
collections, soon to pass under other control.

Under date of December 6, 1838, the President announced to Con-
gress the receipt in this country and the investment of the Smithson
bequest, amounting to a little more than half a million dollars, and
also invited the attention of that body to the obligation devolving upon
the United States to fulfill the objects of that bequest. During the
seven and three-quarters years which ensued to the time of the actual
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 183

foundation of the Smithsonian Institution, this matter was constantly
before Congress, the subject of numerous propositions and of extended
debates. By the will of Smithson the city of Washington was to be
the home of the establishment, but the character and extent of its
buildings, as well as their site, depended upon the policy which
Congress might adopt for carrying out the wishes of the benefactor, so
tersely yet wisely expressed.

The bill which was finally passed and received the approval of the
President on August 10, 1846, gave to the Smithsonian Institution the
custody of the national collections, and provided for a site and building
in the following terms:

AN ACT To establish the “‘Smithsonian Institution,” for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.

Src. 4. And be it further enacted, That, after the board of regents shall have met and
become organized, it shall be their duty forthwith to proceed to select a suitable site
for such building as may be necessary for the institution, which ground may be taken
and appropriated out of that part of the public ground in the city of Washington
lying between the patent office and Seventh Street: Provided, The President of the
United States, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of
War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Commissioner of the Patent Office, shall
consent to the same; but, if the persons last named shall not consent, then such loca-
tion may be made upon any other of the public grounds within the city of Washing-
ton, belonging to the United States, which said regents may select, by and with the
consent of the persons herein named; and the said ground, so selected, shall be set
out by proper metes and bounds, and a description of the same shall be made, and
recorded in a book to be provided for that purpose, and signed by the said regents,
or so many of them as may be convened at the time of their said organization; and
such record, or a copy thereof, certified by the chancellor and secretary of the board
of regents, shall be received in evidence, in all courts, of the extent and boundaries
of the lands appropriated to the said institution; and, upon the making of such rec-
ord, such site and lands shall be deemed and taken to be appropriated, by force of
this act, to the said institution.

Src. 5. And be it further enacted, That, so soon as the board of regents shall have
selected the said site, they shall cause to be erected a suitable building, of plain and
durable materials and structure, without unnecessary ornament, and of sufficient
size, and with suitable rooms or halls, for the reception and arrangement, upon a
liberal scale, of objects of natural history, including a geological and mineralogical
cabinet; also a chemical laboratory, a library, a gallery of art, and the necessary
lecture rooms; and the said board shall have authority, by themselves, or by a com-
mittee of three of their members, to contract for the completion of such building,
upon such plan as may be directed by the board of regents, and shall take sufficient
security for the building and finishing the same according to the said plan, and in
the time stipulated in such contract; and may so locate said building, if they shall
deem it proper, as in appearance to form a wing to the patent office building, and
may so connect the same with the present hall of said patent office building,
containing the national cabinet of curiosities, as to constitute the said hall, in whole
or in part, the deposit for the cabinet of said institution, if they deem it expedient
to do so: provided, said building shall be located upon said patent office lot, in the
manner aforesaid: Provided, however, That the whole expense of the building and
enclosures aforesaid shall not exceed the amount of , which sum is hereby
appropriated, payable out of money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated,

184 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

together with such sum or sums out of the annual interest accruing to the institu-
tion, as may, in any year, remain unexpended, after paying the current expenses of
the institution. And duplicates of all such contracts as may be made by the said
board of regents shall be deposited with the treasurer of the United States; and all
claims on any contract made as aforesaid shall be allowed and certified by the board
of regents, or the executive committee thereof, as the case may be, and, being signed
by the chancellor and secretary of the board, shall be a sufficient voucher for settle-
ment and payment at the treasury of the United States. And the board of regents
shall be authorized to employ such persons as they may deem necessary to superin-
tend the erection of the building and fitting up the rooms of the institution. And all
laws for the protection of public property in the city of Washington shall apply to,
and be in force for, the protection of the lands, buildings, and other property, of
said institution. And all moneys recovered by, or accruing to, the institution, shall
be paid into the treasury of the United States, to the credit of the Smithsonian
bequest, and separately accounted for, as provided in the act approved July first,
eighteen hundred and thirty-six, accepting said bequest.

Src. 6. A nd be it further enacted, That, in proportion as suitable arrangements can
be made for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research,
and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens,
belonging, or hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city of
Washington, in whosesoever custody the same may be, shall be delivered to such.
persons as may be authorized by the board of regents to receive them, and shall be
arranged in such order, and go classed, as best [to] facilitate the examination and study
of them, in the building so as aforesaid to be erected for the institution; * * *

Sec. 7. And be it further enacted, That the secretary of the board of regents shall
take charge of the building and property of said institution. * * *

(Statutes IX, 102. See also The Smithsonian Institution, Documents relative to
its origin and history, 1835-1899, I, pp. 429-434. )

The Smithsonian building, as is well known, was placed upon the

Mall. It was planned with reference to accommodations for a museum,
a library, and other purposes, but the transfer of the specimens from
the Patent Office did not take place until 1858, when Congress began
to make small appropriations for the maintenance of the museum
feature. The collections increased so rapidly that by 1875 they were
occupying fully three-fourths of the Smithsonian building, and, in
fact, all parts not actually required for the activities of the parent
institution, the administrative offices, and the exchange service.

The Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, from which so large a
quantity of valuable objects was acquired that they had to be stored
provisionally in the so-called “Armory building,” which they com-
pletely filled, led to the erection of the present Museum building. It
proved inadequate from the beginning, and for many years new
collections have been accumulating in outside rented buildings, mere
storehouses of brick and wood.

After a lapse of twenty-five years Congress has again appropriated
funds to extend the quarters, but this time on a far more liberal seale,
which will permit of the erection of a much larger and more substan-
tial structure, presenting a dignified exterior, in better keeping with
the other permanent buildings of the Government. It will also stand

on the Mall, but along its northern edge, directly facing the Smith-
sonian building. Upon its completion, the Museum will be in oceu-
pancy of a group of three buildings, counting a part of the Smithso-
nian as one, and it may safely be predicted that none will long contain
any vacant space.

THE SMITHSONIAN GROUNDS.

In a bill for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution, pre-
pared by Representative John Quincy Adams, and presented to the
United States Senate on February 18, 1839,” provision was made for
an astronomical observatory, to be erected under the direction of the
Secretary of the Treasury upon land belonging to the United States,
which, after its selection, should be granted for the purpose and con-
veyed asa deed of gift to the trustees of the Institution. ‘The locality
known as Camp Hill, near the banks of the Potomac River and the
mouth of Rock Creek, opposite Analostan Island, seems to have been
under consideration at that time. It was the same site that Washing-
ton had designated for the National University, and was subsequently
used for the object Mr. Adams had in mind, but under the direction
of the United States Naval Establishment.

In another bill, introduced in the Senate by Lewis F. Linn, on Feb-
ruary 10, 1841,’ it was proposed that the entire tract known as the
Mall be appropriated for the uses of the Smithsonian Institution, with
the provision that the buildings should be erected in accordance with
plans prepared by and under the supervision of the National Institu-
‘tion, to be approved by the President of the United States. In bills
submitted to the same body in June and December, 1844, by the
Library Committee, consisting of Senators Rufus Choate, Benjamin
Tappan, and James McP. Berrien, appeared the first definite charac-
terization of the building, which was to be placed upon a site to be
selected in that portion of the Mall lying west of Seventh street. -

The bill for the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution which
finally passed Congress and received the approval of the President on
August 10, 1546,° was drafted by Representative Robert Dale Owen.
The sections relating to the site and building are quoted on pages 183
and 184 of the introduction.

Upon the organization of the Board of Regents attention in regard
to the site seems first to have been directed toward the Mall, and here
its location was finally established, though not without some difficul-
ties and delay, the choice being subject to approval by the President
of the United States, the Secretaries of State, the Treasury, War, and
the Navy, and the Commissioner of Patents. At a meeting’ of the
Regents on September 9, 1846, the chancellor, the Secretary, and the

executive committee, five in all, were constituted a committee on
grounds and buildings, whose first report, submitted on November 30
of the same year, resulted in the passage of the following resolution:

That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution do select and adopt asa site for
their buildings so much of the Mall, in the city of Washington, as lies between
Seventh street and the river Potomac, if the consent of the persons named in the
fourth section of the act to establish the Smithsonian Institution for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men be obtained thereto; and that upon such consent
being obtained in due form, the Secretary is hereby instructed to cause the said
ground so selected to be set out by proper metes and bounds.

On December 1 following .the Board amended the above resolution
by adding the following clause after the word Potomac:
Subject to the power of Congress to grant any portion of the same west of Four-

teenth street to the Washington Monument Society for the purpose of erecting a
monument thereon.

As consent to this proposition was not obtained, it was resolved by
the Regents on December 9:

That a committee of three be appointed by the chancellor to confer with the
President of the United States and the other persons named in the fourth section of
said act, and ask their consent to the selection by said Regents of that portion of
said reservation lying between Seventh and Twelfth streets west, in said city, as the
site for the necessary buildings of said institution; and, if such consent be given—

It is further resolved, That said buildings be located thereon, and at least two hun-
dred and fifty feet south of the centre thereof.

The committee designated consisted of Representatives Hough and
Owen and Senator Evans, but failing in the object of their mission,
the Board resolved, on December 23:

That the Regents of the Smithsonian do select and appropriate as the site for
their buildings the south half of so much of the ‘‘ Mall,”’ in the city of Washington,
as lies between Ninth and Twelfth streets.

The consent to this choice by the President and other persons
named in the fourth section of the fundamental act was communicated
to the Board on January 20, 1847, and the further provisions of the
act were then carried out, namely:

And the said ground so selected shall be set out by proper metes and bounds,
and a description of the same shall be made, and recorded in a book to be provided
for that purpose, and signed by the said Regents, or so many of them as may be
convened at the time of their said organization; and such record, or a copy thereof,
certified by the chancellor and Secretary of the Board of Regents, shall be received
in evidence, in all courts, of the extent and boundaries of the lands appropriated to

the said Institution; and upon the making of such record such site and lands shall
be deemed and taken to be appropriated, by force of this act, to the said Institution.

After the close of these proceedings, however, which at the time
seemed to be conclusive and did finally prevail, the subject of a site
was again reopened and led to further inquiries and considerations.
These can best be told in the words of the late Dr. George Brown
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 187

Goode, as recorded-in his paper on the Smithsonian Building and
Grounds.“

After the present site had been selected there appears to have been some dissatis-
faction in regard to it; nor is this to be wondered at, since at that time the Mall was
remote from the inhabited portion of the city, being a part of what was then known
as ‘‘The Island,’’ now called South Washington. This portion of the city was cut
off by an old and unsightly canal running to the Potomac and crossed by simple
wooden bridges at four points between the Capitol and the Potomac River. It was
unfenced and waste, occupied from time to time by military encampments and by
traveling showmen. After the completion of the east wing in 1850, when the first
lectures were held in the Institution, the Regents were obliged to build plank walks
for the accommodation of visitors. Indeed, with the exception of the Capitol
grounds and those surrounding the Executive Mansion, the open places in the city
were entirely unimproved.

Soon after the selection of the present site the question was reconsidered by the
Board, and a committee appointed to obtain, if possible, another location. In the
bill as it finally passed Congress permission had been given to locate the building
on the space between the Patent Office and Seventh street, now occupied by the
building used for the offices of the Interior Department. This was partly to enable
the Institution to utilize for its collections the large hall in the Patent Office then
assigned to the ‘‘ National Cabinet of Curiosities,’’ partly, no doubt, to secure a more
central location. To obtain this ground, however, it was necessary to have the
approval of the President of the United States and other public officials, which was
not found practicable. The committee fixed upon Judiciary Square, an open space
of rough ground, in which at that time the city hall (a portion of the present struc-
ture), the infirmary, and the city jail were located. Though the adjoining streets
were entirely vacant, this site was regarded as much more accessible than the Mall.

A proposition was submitted to the common council of the city of Washington,
that the site of the city hall should be resigned for the use of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution upon its offering to pay to the city $50,000, a sum deemed sufficient to erect a —
building for the use of the city government upon the site south of Pennsylvania
avenue, between Seventh and Ninth streets, now occupied by the Center Market.
A bill was introduced into Congress, authorizing the Regents to purchase the city
hall, but the common council refused to consider the proposition and the site of the
Mall was used.

That part of the Mall appropriated to the Institution has been known
as the Smithsonian reservation, while to the entire square between
Seventh street and Twelfth street, west, including the reservation,
the name Smithsonian Park has been commonly applied.

At their meetings of December 4, 1846, and January 28, 1847, the
Regents appropriated a total sum of $4,000 for grading, laying out,
and planting the grounds of the Institution, under the direction of the
building committee, which was also authorized to expend not over
$10,000 in the construction of a permanent fence around the grounds.
The latter, however, was erected for less than $500.

In 1848, the building committee entered into a contract with John
Douglas, of Washington, to the extent of $1,050 for inclosing the
reservation with a hedge and for planting trees and shrubs. The

188 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

architect of the building marked out the paths and roads and indicated
the positions of the trees and shrubs, to comprise about 160 species,
principally American. The surrounding hedge was to consist on each
of the four sides, respectively, of pyrocanthus, osage orange, cherokee
rose, and hawthorn. Although considerable progress in this work
seems to have been made during the year, the contract was considered
not to have been properly complied with, and it was canceled in 1849.

The same year, for the convenience of those who attended the lec-
tures in the east wing of the Smithsonian building, a walk was built
from Seventh street to the eastern gate of the grounds and the path
from the Twelfth Street Bridge was repaired. In speaking of the
considerable expense which such improvements outside the reservation
entailed upon the Institution, Secretary Henry, in his report for 1849,
sald:

It is hoped that the authorities of the city of Washington will cause bridges to
be erected across the canal and walks to be constructed through the publie grounds,
to facilitate the approach to the building, and that the Institution will not be expected
to provide accommodations of this kind.

In their report for 1850, the building committee stated that up to
the end of that year $3,747.51 had been spent upon the grounds, and
that probably little more expenditure on that account would be neces-
sary. Portions of the roads about the building had been graded and
many trees and shrubs set out. An appropriation having been made
by Congress for the purpose, Mr. Andrew J. Downing, at the request
of the President, was then preparing a plan for converting the entire
Mall, including the Smithsonian grounds, into a landscape garden. If
this plan were adopted, the Smithsonian lot would form part of an
extended park, of which the Smithsonian building, by its site and
picturesque style of architecture, would be a prominent and attractive
feature.

In 1851, according to the report of the same committee, the Mall
was in course of rapid improvement under Mr. Downing. The cor-
poration of the city appropriated $2,500 for an iron bridge across the
canal at Tenth street, and a gravel walk was carried thence to the
building. The Smithsonian reservation of 19 acres had been inclosed
with a fence and planted with trees at an expense to the Institution of |
about $4,000, but the execution of Mr. Downing’s plan, at the cost
of the General Government, would, in the view of the committee,
render unnecessary any further disbursements by the Institution.
Without surrendering the right of use of the reservation appropri-
ated to the Institution, the partition fence between it and the other
part of the Mall had been removed and the whole given in charge of
Mr. Downing. |

Although relieved at this period, and at its own request, of the care -
and improvement of its grounds, which have since remained under the
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 189

supervision of the officer in charge of public grounds, the Institution
has always maintained a deep interest in the condition of its surround-
ings, and has in fact aided materially toward their betterment, as fre-
quently noted in the reports of Secretary Henry and his successors.

In 1855 Professor Henry wrote that since the death of the lamented
Downing but little had been done to complete the general plans of the
improvement of the Mall proposed by him and adopted by Congress,
although an annual appropriation had been made for keeping in order
the lot on which the Smithsonian building is situated. Regret was
expressed that Congress had not made an appropriation to promote
the suggestion of Dr. John Torrey and other botanists of establishing
here.an arboretum to exhibit the various ornamental trees of indi-
genous growth in this country.

This scheme was never more than tentatively carried out, but in 1899
the Secretary of Agriculture revived the subject, in his annual report,
from which the following extract is taken:

One of the needs of the Department is an aboretum in which can be brought
together for study all the trees that will grow in the climate of Washington. - The
need of such an establishment was felt early in the history of the capital and was
brought forward more than fifty years ago among the various plans proposed for the
use of the Smithson bequest, which was finally devoted to the founding of the pres-
ent Smithsonian Institution. In the report of the building committee of that Insti-
tution for 1850 the following statement occurs:

“Mr. Downing, the well-known writer on rural architecture, at the request of the
President, is now preparing a plan for converting the whole Mall, including the
Smithsonian grounds, into an extended landscape garden, to be traversed in different
directions by graveled walks and carriage drives and planted with specimens, prop-
erly labeled, of all the varieties of trees and shrubs which will flourish in this cli-
mate.”’

This admirable plan, apparently from lack of financial support from Congress, was
never systematically prosecuted, and the plantings at first made were so neglected
that the nurse trees themselves are now being rapidly broken down and destroyed
by storm, disease, and decay. When the grounds of the Department of Agriculture
were laid out, in 1868, Mr. William Saunders, then, as now, horticulturist of the
Department, established a small arboretum commensurate with the size of the
grounds. An arboretum in this climate, however, requires an area of several hun-
dred acres. The time has come when the economic needs of the Department and
the education and pleasure of the people demand a rich collection of trees planted
so as to secure the best effects of landscape art, furnishing complete materials for
the investigations of the Department of Agriculture, and so managed as to be a
perennial means of botanical education. We are now engaged in introducing useful
trees from all parts of the world, such as those producing fruits, dyes, nuts, oils, and
tans, those useful for ornamental purposes, and especially those promising shade,
shelter, and fuel in the arid region.

At the present time we have no central place in which to plant and maintain a
series of these trees for study and propagation. The importations must be sent out
as fasta they are received, without any opportunity for our investigators to make
any observations on their behavior under cultivation, and in the case of small and
valuable importations subjecting the whole stock to the possibility of total loss. In
view of these conditions, I wish to bring to the attention of Congress the importance
190 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

of placing at the disposal of this Department an area of suitable size and situation
for a comprehensive arboretum. In order to give a specific basis for considera-
tion of this project, I suggest that the area known as the Mall be set aside for this
purpose.

’

‘*No part of the public domain,” said Professor Henry in 1856, ‘‘is
more used than the reservation on which the Smithsonian building
stands, but as yet no special appropriation has been made by Con-
gress for continuing the improvement of the grounds, and it is to be
regretted that years should be suffered to pass without planting the
trees which are in the future to add to the beauty, health, and comfort
of the capital of the nation.” In the same connection mention is made
of the beautiful monument erected that year near the Institution by
the American Pomological Society to the memory of Downing—a just
tribute to the worth of one of the benefactors of our country. The
adoption of his ornamental plan for the public parks of this city was
in part due to the example of the Regents in embellishing the grounds
around the Smithsonian building.

In 1858 Professor Henry remarked that—

The proposition to supply the public grounds with a complete series of American
trees has long been contemplated, but as no appropriation has been made by Con-
gress for this purpose, the Patent Office, conjointly with the Institution, has taken
the preliminary steps by issuing a circular asking for seeds of every species of our
forest trees and shrubs that would be likely to thrive in this latitude. This circular
has been widely distributed, and it is hoped will meet with a favorable response from
all who are interested in making more generally known, and in introducing into more
extensive cultivation, the natural ornamental products of our own soil. The seeds
are to be sent by mail to the Commissioner of Patents and placed in charge of the
officers having the care of the public grounds.

In 1862 Professor Henry reported that the trees and shrubbery in
the grounds were growing finely under the care of the commissioner
of public grounds, B. B. French, esq. He also called attention to
the city canal forming the boundary of the Smithsonian grounds on the
north, and across the basin or widest part of which most of the visi-
tors to the Institution had to pass. This basin,‘since the introduction
of Potomac water, had become the receptacle of the sewage of the
city, and was then an immense cesspool, constantly emitting noxious
effluvia prejudicial to the health and offensive to the senses of all who
approached the locality. Certain methods of abating the nuisance were
suggested,

As before noted, the fence and hedge which originally marked the
outlines of the Smithsonian reservation were removed in the time of
Downing, thus destroying all visible traces of its limits. On the
south this reservation is bounded by B street south, on the west by
Twelfth street west. Its depth from B street is 759 feet 9 inches
and its length from Twelfth street 1,086 feet 8 inches, its eastern line
coinciding with the western line of Ninth street. Its area, therefore,
amounts to about 825,590 square feet, or a little less than 19 acres.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 191

‘

The Smithsonian building occupies a central position in the reserva-
tion, its main entrance being on the axis of Tenth street extended.
The Museum building, finished in 1881, stands 50 feet to the eastward
of the Smithsonian building, with its front face nearly on a line with
the rear face of the latter. It extends back to B street south, and on
the east overreaches by about 65 feet the limits of the reservation.
There still remains at the southwest corner of the reservation, border-
ing on B and Twelfth streets, sufficient space for another structure of
smaller size than the Museum building, should it ever be considered
advisable to make such use of it, but otherwise all new buildings must
be placed outside of the reservation.

The Army Medical Museum, erected in 1886, at the corner of B
and Seventh streets southwest, is the only other structure in the
Smithsonian park, and further extensive building operations within
this square must be carried to its northern side. Such action has been
necessary in regard to the additional large building for the National
Museum authorized by Congress in 1903, the center of which, like
that of the Smithsonian building, will be on a line with the axis of

Tenth street.
As to the present condition of the park it may be said that all traces

of the old canal and creek have long since disappeared, and fairly
good paths and driveways now lead to the Smithsonian and Museum
buildings. Unfortunately, however, no improvement can be noted in
regard to the trees and shrubs, which were to be made so prominent
a feature. None have been planted for many years, and the older
ones are dying out or being destroyed by natural causes, much injury
having been produced by severe storms. There has been a constant
trimming and cutting down, but no attempt to add or build up in this
direction, and the general effect is of a park lacking care and culti-
vation.
THE SMITHSONIAN BUILDING.

HISTORICAL ACCOUNT.

In his account of the Smithsonian building and grounds,” the late
Dr. George Brown Goode has said:

That the Smithsonian Institution, before it could begin active, operations, must
have a home of its own, would doubtless have been regarded as a necessity by any
one considering the requirements of the future. Richard Rush, however, appears to
have been the first to state this idea in words, which he did in a letter addressed,
November 6, 1838, to the Secretary of State, in response to a request of the President
for suggestions in regard to the proper manner of carrying out the bequest. * * *

In bills introduced in the Senate in June and December, 1844, by the Library
Committee—Rufus Choate, Benjamin Tappan, and James McP. Berrien—appeared
the first definite characterization of the bone which was to be pun and durable,

«The oat heouian TGR: 1846-1896: The foe of its First Half Century,
pp. 247 et seq.
192 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

without unnecessary ornament, and to contain provisions for cabinets of natural
history and geology, and for a library, a chemical laboratory, and lecture rooms.
* * * The cost was at that time limited to $80,000. In 1846, however, the bill of
Dr. Robert Dale Owen, without change of phraseology from those which had pre-
ceded it in regard to location and character of the structure, was adopted, but the
limit of the cost was increased, and $242,129, the exact amount of the Smithsonian
interest which had at that time accrued, ‘‘together with any additional interest
which might remain after paying the current expenses of the succeeding years,’’ was
designated for that purpose. * * *

From the very beginning Doctor Owen was the chief advocate of a large and
showy building. In this matter he was supported by the sympathy of the people of
Washington; and especially Mr. William W. Seaton, mayor of the city and one of the
Regents, whose interest in the realization of the plan of Smithson undoubtedly did
much at last to secure action from Congress. Outside of Washington there was much
opposition to an expensive building, owing partly to the manner in which the
bequest of Stephen Girard had been rendered for many years inoperative by the
action of its trustees. * * * Dr. Owen, nevertheless, more than any other person
at that time concerned in the establishment of the Institution, seems to have felt
that much of its future success depended upon the erection of a building which
should perform a legitimate duty in dignifying and making conspicuous the work of
the organization to which it belonged. Scarcely anyone can doubt that Doctor
Owen was right and that the usefulness of the Smithsonian Institution has been
materially aided by the fact that its building has for fifty years been one of the chief
architectural ornaments of the national capital.

1846 and 1847.

The first formal action of the Board of Regents, in respect to the

building called for in the fundamental act, was the passage of a reso-
lution on September 9, 1846, authorizing and instructing the Chan-
cellor, Secretary, and executive committee—
to take such measures as may be deemed by them most proper to obtain plans
for the erection of buildings, fulfilling all the conditions in reference to them con-
tained in the law organizing this institution, and that said committee report such
plan as they may approve to this Board at its next meeting; and, further, that said
committee specially report in regard to the best material for said buildings, and to
the best modes of warming, lighting, and ventilating the same, with estimates of the
cost when constructed of different materials, ete.
The committee so organized consisted of Vice President George
M. Dallas, chairman; Representatives William J. Hough and Robert
Dale Owen, Gen. Joseph G. Totten, and W. W. Seaton, mayor of
Washington.

A notice to architects, inviting competitive designs, was published
in the Washington newspapers of September 22, 1846, and with the
object of accumulating information that might guide the Board in the
choice of a plan for the building, a subcommittee, consisting of Messrs.
Owen, Hough, and Totten, visited the principal cities of the United
States; examined many of their most noted structures; had confer-
ences with several eminent architects; collected specimens of the best
stone material, and obtained data regarding the cost of construction.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 193

This subcommittee reported the results of their inquiries on Novem-
ber 30, 1846. After which the full—

committee unanimously selected out of thirteen plans that were submitted to them
by some of the principal architects throughout the country, two by Mr. James Ren-
wick, jr., of the city of New York, the architect of Grace Church, the Church of the
Puritans, Calvary Church, and other structures in and near New York; and they
recommended to the Board for adoption one of these, being a design in the later
Norman, or, as it may, with more strict propriety, be called, the Lombard style, as
if prevailed in Germany, Normandy, and in southern Europe in the twelfth cen-
tury. The design comprises a center building, with two wings, connected with the
main building by low ranges and a cloister. The entire front is 421 feet, and the
extreme depth in the center, including the carriage porch, 153 feet. The height of
the principal tower is 145 feet, and that of the main building, to the summit of the
battlement, 58 feet. The design includes all the accommodations demanded by the
charter, to wit: A museum, 200 feet by 50; a library, 90 feet by 50; a gallery of art,
in the form of a T, 125 feet long; two lecture rooms, one of which is capable of con-
taining from 800 to 1,000 persons, and the other is connected with the chemical
laboratory; a committee room for the Board of Regents; a Secretary’s room; a room
for the effects of Mr. Smithson; a janitor’s room, ete.

At a meeting of the Regents on January 23, 1847, the following
resolution from the committee was brought up for consideration, but
no action upon it was taken, namely:

That the Norman plan of a building for the Smithsonian Institution, furnished by
James Renwick, jr., of New York, substantially as amended, agreeably to the sug-
gestions of the committee, is approved and adopted by this Board.

On January 26, 1847, the chancellor submitted the following reso-
lutions, which were read and laid upon the table:

Resolved, That in view of the vast field of knowledge, to the increase and diffusion
of which the act of Congress directs the efforts and funds of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, this Board deem it inexpedient and hazardous to appropriate to the erection
of a building a larger sum than one hundred thousand dollars.

Resolved, That John Haviland, of Philadelphia, architect, be requested to state in
writing, formally to this Board, whether he will undertake to erect a building upon
the model of the central structure he has already planned and furnished to this
Board, with slight changes of arrangement, which will embrace all the chief objects
expressed in the act of Congress, for the sum of one hundred thousand dollars; said
building to be of granite or sandstone.

Resolved, That the committee of three, hereinafter appointed, be authorized to
confer with Mr. Haviland, and that, upon this Board receiving from him the written
and formal undertaking mentioned in the foregoing resolution, they be authorized to
engage his services as architect for the execution of his plan and to complete all the
necessary contracts.

Mr. Alexander D. Bache, one of the Regents, submitted to the
Board on January 27, 1847, two resolutions of similar import, the
consideration of both of which was deferred. One of these was as
follows:

Resolved, That in the opinion of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion it is unnecessary and inexpedient to expend, in erecting a building to meet the
requirements of the act creating the establishment, from the principal of the fund of

NAT Mus 1903——13
194 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

two hundred and forty-two thousand one hundred and twenty-nine dollars referred
to in the first section of the act, a sum exceeding one hundred thousand dollars.

The resolutions finally adopted preliminary to the work of building
: I i yy g
were agreed to by the Regents on January 28, 1847, nearly all bein
B ; S i : a
offered by Mr. Owen. The most important follow:

Resolved, That the Norman plan of a building for the Smithsonian Institution,
furnished by James Renwick, jr., of New York, substantially as amended and
reduced agreeably to the suggestions of the committee, is approved by this Board.

Resolved, That a building committee of three members of the Board, as provided
in the fifth section of the act of Congress, be appointed, who are hereby authorized
and empowered, on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, to enter into contracts for
the completion of the buildings; and that said committee have power to employ one
or more persons to superintend the erection of the buildings and the fitting up of
the rooms of the institution; and that the work shall be done to the entire satisfac-
tion of the said superintendent or superintendents; and that the said superintendent
or superintendents shall have power, and shall be required, to reject any of the
material proposed to be employed, and also to object to inferior or insufficient work,
and to direct its change, at his or their discretion.

Resolved, That in the performance of the duty intrusted to them, the building com-
mittee of three hereinbefore referred to shall give the contracts to the lowest bidder
of good reputation, who shall give unexceptionable security, to the entire satisfac-
tion of the committee, for the performance of said contracts; and such security shall
in all cases be taken. No advance shall in any case be made; and fifteen per cent.
of all payments shall be retained until the faithful performance of the work.

Resolved, That the building committee, after taking counsel with the Secretary,
shall carefully revise the specifications of the plan furnished to this Board by the
architect before entering into any contract; and if, after such examination, they
shall be of opinion that any modifications of the said plan and specifications are nec-
essary for the safety, durability, or better adaptation of the structure, they may
incorporate these in the said specifications; but no addition to the dimensions of the
building shall be made, nor any ornament of any kind added; and the said modifi-
cations shall have sole reference to the safety, durability, and adaptation of the
building. And the whole amount of the contract for the said building, including
the modifications above provided for, shall, under no circumstances, exceed the
amount of the original estimates of the architect, to wit: the sum of two hundred
and two thousand dollars, with a percentage not exceeding ten per cent. on the said
sum. 7

Resolved, That the building committee be also authorized to contract for the warm-
ing and lighting of the building; provided that the contract for the above objects
shall not exceed five thousand dollars.

Resolved, That the building committee be also authorized to contract for the fitting
up and furnishing of the building of the institution; provided that the contract for
the same shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars. * * *

And it being on the one hand desirable that a portion of the buildings to be
erected by the institution be ready for use at an early day, and on the other hand it
is essential to the solidity and durability of a structure of the size required to
embrace all the objects specified in the act of Congress that its erection be gradual
and not too rapidly hastened forward: Therefore—

Resolved, That the building committee be instructed to arrange the contracts for
the buildings of the institution so that the wings of said buildings may be completed
in two years from the present time, and the whole completed in five years.

Resolved, That the building committee be instructed, in the arrangement of the
buildings, to extend the gallery of art throughout the western range and western

wing, and to arrange two lecture rooms, and no more, in the building. Temporary
arrangements shall be made to receive in the west wing of the building the library
of the Institution, until the library proper be completed.

2. Resolved, That the building committee invite proposals for the construction of
the exterior walls of the building of upper Potomac sandstone, of marble, of granite,
and of blue gneiss, respectively, and adopt that one of these four named materials which
shall be deemed to combine the requisites of cheapness, beauty, and durability.

The manner of providing for the cost of building and other matters
relating thereto were explained by Secretary Henry in his report for
1850, in which he says that—

The law of Congress incorporating the Institution, while it did not forbid the
expenditure of a part of the income for other objects, authorized the formation of a
library, a museum, and a gallery of art, and the erection of a building, on a liberal
scale, for their accommodation. It was, indeed, the opinion of many that the whole
income ought to be expended on these objects. The Regents did not consider them-
selves at liberty to disregard the indications of Congress and the opinion expressed
in favor of collections, and after much discussion it was finally concluded to divide
the income into two equal parts, and after deducting the general expenses, to devote
one-half to the active operations set forth in the plan just described and the other
to the formation of a library, a museum, and a gallery of art.

* * * It therefore became absolutely necessary that the income should be
increased, and in order to do this it was proposed to save the greater part of the
$242,000 of accrued interest which Congress had authorized to be expended in a
building, by erecting at a cost not to exceed $50,000 the nucleus of an edifice which
could be expanded as the wants of the Institution might require,and to add the
remainder to the principal.

Unfortunately, however, for this proposition, Congress had presented to the Insti-
tution the great museum of the exploring expedition, and a majority of the Regents,
supposing it necessary to make immediate provision for the accommodation of this
gift, had taken preliminary steps, previous to my appointment, to construct a large
building, and, indeed, a majority of the committee to which the matter was referred
had determined to adopt the plan of the present edifice. Strenuous opposition was,
however, made to this, and as a compromise it was finally agreed to draw from the
United States Treasury $250,000 of accrued interest, and instead of expending this
immediately in completing the plan of the proposed building to invest it in Treasury
notes, then at par, and to finish the building in the course of five years, in part out
of the interest of these notes, in part out of the sale of a portion of them, and also in
part out of a portion of the annual interest accruing on the original bequest. It was
estimated that in this way, at the end of five years, besides devoting $250,000 to the
building, the annual income of the Institution would be increased from $30,000 to
nearly $40,000, a sum sufficient to carry out all the provisions of the programme.

It is to be regretted that * * * instead of the plan of a costly building there
had not been adopted the nucleus of a more simple edifice, which could have been
modified to meet the wants which experience might indicate.

The original estimate for the building, furniture, and improvement of the grounds
was $250,000, and could the actual cost have been confined to this sum all the results
anticipated from the scheme of finance which had been adopted would have been
realized at the end of five years. During the past year, however, it has been found
necessary, for the better protection of the collections, to order the fireproofing of
the interior of the edifice, at an increased expense of $44,000. This additional draft
on the funds can only be met by extending the time for the completion of the build-
ing, and even this will require the appropriation of a portion of the income which
196 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

ought to be devoted to other purposes. The active operations will suffer most by
this draft on-the income, since it will be made for the better accommodation of the
library and the museum.

On February 5, 1847, it was resolved by the Regents—

That the building committee, in conjunction with the Secretary, be authorized to
publish, in such form as they may deem most appropriate, one thousand copies of a
brief treatise, to be entitled ‘‘ Hints on Public Architecture,’’ and to be illustrated
with designs of the plan of the building adopted for the Smithsonian Institution,
and, at the option of the committee, with any other designs that are the property of
the Institution, provided that the cost of the same shall not exceed one thousand
dollars, which sum is hereby appropriated for that purpose.

This allotment was subsequently increased to $1,200. The work
was prepared by Doctor Owen, with the assistance of Mr. Renwick,
and was published in 1849, under the title ‘‘ Hints on Public Archi-
tecture, containing, among other illustrations, views and plans of the
Smithsonian Institution, together with an appendix relative to build-
ing materials. Prepared on behalf of the Building Committee of the
Smithsonian Institution, by Robert Dale Owen, Chairman of the Com-
mittee.” It is quarto in size, but does not belong to any of the regu-
lar series of Smithsonian publications.

The first building committee of three members, appointed on Feb-
ruary 5, 1847, consisted of Mr. Robert Dale Owen, Mr. W. W. Sea-
ton, and Gen. Joseph G. Totten. Changes were made in the compo-
sition of the committee from year to year, and after a brief period
none of its early members remained. Reports were submitted annu-
ally to the Board of Regents up to the close of 1857. The work of
the committee during 1847 was extremely arduous, comprising the
selection of the stone for the building, the preparation of specifica-
tions, the making of contracts, ete., all of which was accomplished
within an incredibly short space of time. Forty-one meetings were
held during the year.

Various marble, granite, and freestone quarries within a moderate
distance of Washington were examined, with the gratuitous assistance
of David Dale Owen, a brother of the regent and a prominent geolo-
gist, and much information regarding them and the quality of their
products was obtained. The inquiries embraced the chief marble and
granite quarries of Maryland; the freestone quarries of Aquia Creek,
Virginia, where the material for the older part of the Capitol, the
White House, Treasury, and other public buildings in Washington
had been secured; and the freestone quarries of the upper Potomac
River, mostly in the vicinity of Seneca Creek, on the banks of the
Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, about 23 miles above Washington.

The marble quarries of Maryland (mostly in the vicinity of Clarks-
ville, about 13 miles from Baltimore) were found to yield two quali-

ties of stone—one fine grained and of excellent quality, the other
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 197

somewhat coarse, highly crystalline, and inferior in quality, known as
‘alum limestone.”

- The quarries in the neighborhood of Woodstock, Maryland, fur-
nished a granite equal to that of Quincy, and not excelled for beauty
of appearance, compactness of structure, and uniformity of color,
texture, and composition by any other granite quarries in the United
States. There was no objection to this stone except on the score of
expense, unless it be considered that in this material the effect of light
and shade from projecting surfaces is Ina measure lost, while in marble
and good tinted freestone every shadow is sharply marked.

The Aquia Creek freestone was not to be trusted, being pervaded
by dark specks of the protoxide and peroxide of iron, which, in per-
oxidating, acquire a yellowish or reddish color, and having occasional
clay holes, such as disfigure the Treasury and Patent Office buildings.

The freestone from the upper Potomac, in the vicinity of Senec:
Creek, was considered the best and most durable of all the Potomac
freestones. The lilac-gray variety found in the Bull Run quarry, 23
miles from Washington, was especially recommended and pronounced
to be equal, if not superior, to that supplied for Trinity Church, New
York, from the quarries of New Jersey. It has a quality that specially
recommends it to builders. When first quarried it is comparatively
soft, working freely before the chisel and hammer; but, by exposure,
it gradually indurates, and ultimately acquires a toughness and con-
sistency that not only enables it to resist atmospheric vicissitudes,
but even the most severe mechanical wear and tear. It can, there-
fore, be worked at less expense than granite or marble and was the kind
selected for the building.

All of the above varieties of stone were subjected to tests for dura-
bility under exposure to the weather, etc., by Prof. Charles G.. Page.
Their cost per cubic foot, delivered in Washington, in accordance
with the lowest prices quoted by quarry owners, was as follows:

Bids for the construction of the building were received up to March
15, 1847, and were opened on March 16. Several were found to be
proposals for doing only a part or some particular kind of the work,
but for the erection of the entire building there were fourteen bids,
varying in amount from $196,000 to $318,000. James Dixon & Co.,
of Washington, were the lowest bidders for Seneca freestone laid in
rubble masonry, and also for ashlar finish, as follows:

198 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The committee decided that regularly coursed ashlar was best suited
to the design and would make a more substantial piece of work than
rubble. They also concluded that, with a doubt whether Seneca free-
stone did not assort even better with the Lombard style of architec-
ture adopted than marble, it was inexpedient to expend $23,000 addi-
tional for the latter. The bid of James Dixon & Co. (consisting of
James Dixon, of Washington, and Gilbert Cameron, of New York),
at $205,250, was therefore accepted. Mr. Dixon retired from the
firm on June 1, 1847.

The contract was signed on March 19, 1847. It included the most
expensive part of the furniture, such as the shelving, cases, desks,
drawers, and tables in the laboratory and apparatus room; the book-
cases, large tables, and aleove desks in the library; the glass cases in
the museum; the seats in the lecture rooms, elevators, toilet rooms,
rain-water cisterns; the chairs and tables in the Regents’ rooms, flues
for heating and lighting, ete., but not the heating and lighting plant
nor the drainage.

One condition of the contract was that the work should extend
through five years, or to March 19, 1852. It was also stipulated that
the building should be erected in such proportions during each year
as the committee might direct, but so that the payments to the con-
tractor in each of the first four years of the contract should not exceed
$41,000 annually, and that the wings and connecting ranges should be
completed in two years from the date of the contract.

It was subsequently appended to the contract that in case the Regents
should thereafter determine to make important alterations in the plan
of the building or in the time of its execution, the contractor was to be
paid pro rata according to the prices in the contract for work executed,
and reasonable damages if the nature of the case should justly demand it.

The architect, James Renwick, jr., who resided in New York and
made approximately monthly visits to Washington, was paid at the
rate of $1,800 a year, with traveling expenses amounting to about $300
more. An assistant architect and superintendent, Mr. Robert Mills,
was also employed on the grounds, at $1,000 a year.

The probable cost of the building had been estimated as follows:

Owing, however, to the contract being lower than was expected, and
to other facts, the committee judged that the expenditures for the
building for the five years would amount to only about $236,000.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 199

The location of the building was fixed in the middle of the Smith-
sonian reservation as to north and south, the center of the main
structure being upon the axis of Tenth street southwest.

Toward the close of the year 1847, as stated in the committee’s
report, the contractor was covering in the east connecting range, and
hoped still to cover in the east wing before the frost interfered. He
had also begun to lay the foundations of the west wing and connecting
range, but nothing had yet been done toward the erection of the main
building.

The corner stone was laid on May 1, 1847, with imposing Masonic
ceremonies, the day being regarded in Washington in the nature of a
public holiday. A procession over a mile in length, composed
of the various lodges of Free and Accepted Masons of the District
of Columbia, with a large delegation of Masons from Baltimore and
Philadelphia, the District militia, and three military bands, having
formed at the city hall, proceeded to the Executive Mansion, where
it was joined by the President, heads of Departments, members of
the diplomatic corps, etc., and thence to the Smithsonian grounds.
The marshal in chief was Mr. William Beverly Randolph. After
prayer by the grand chaplain of the Grand Lodge of Maryland, the
ceremony of laying the stone was performed by Grand Marshal Ben-
jamin B. French, assisted by Col. James Page and Mr. Charles Gilman,
grand masters of Pennsylvania and Maryland, respectively. An
address was then delivered by Hon. George M. Dallas, chancellor of
the Board of Regents. A national salute was fired by the Columbia
Artillery and one of the bands played a national air. The ceremonies
closed with the benediction, pronounced by Rey. Frank 8. Evans.
The gavel used and the apron worn by the grand marshal were the
same that had been used by Washington in conducting the Masonic
ceremonies upon the laying of the corner stone of the national Capi-
tol. In a cavity of the stone were deposited, in a leaden box and
leaden casket, many articles appropriate to the purpose, and among
them an engraved plate, inscribed with the names of the members of
the establishment, the officers and Board of Regents of the Institution,
the building committee, and the architects. The ceremonies were
witnessed by at least 6,000 or 7,000 persons.

1848.

At the close of 1848 the building committee reported that the east
wing and adjacent range would probably be ready for occupation early
in January. The interior of this part was at that time finished except
the shelving of the cases for the apparatus and the furnaces and ven-
tilating apparatus. Battlements, not in the original plan, had been
added to the eastern cloister, as the roof seemed too conspicuous.
200 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The west wing and connecting range were completed externally, and
the hall of the gallery of art (intended to be used temporarily for the
library) was well advanced. Work upon the bookcases was in prog-
ress. The foundations of the main part of the building, including
the towers, were laid, and the superstructure carried about 5 feet
high. The campanile, octagonal towers, and two smaller corner
towers of the center building were 30 feet above their foundations.

1849.

The entire Smithsonian building, according to the annual statement
of the building committee for 1849, was under roof before winter, the
work having been pushed to protect the large amount of masonry and
woodwork. The central front towers and four corner towers of the
main building were carried up as high as the walls of that building,
and the central rear tower 30 feet high. The work of fitting the west
wing and connecting range for temporary library purposes was still
in progress. The east wing was taken possession of for the uses of
the Institution April 10, 1849.

The following changes were made during the year: The lecture hall,
as originally constructed, in the east wing, proving entirely too small,
the adjoining apparatus and laboratory rooms were removed and the
entire wing formed into one large lecture hall provided with seats for
1,000 persons. The proposed lecture room in the lower main hall
was given up, and the space thus obtained was divided, a room 65 by
50 feet being assigned as a depository for physical apparatus, the
remaining space being allotted to the library. The east range was to
be used for the laboratory and working apparatus rooms, connecting
on the one side with the lecture hall and on the other with the
apparatus museum.

The two stairways, which in the original plan were carried up
between the two north front towers and the main building, were
dispensed with and the place they occupied added to the library,
as was also the central hall, and, as before said, a portion of the
proposed lecture hall. The space for the library was thereby nearly
doubled in size, and the staircase was to occupy the interior of one of
the front towers. A clerestory to the long upper room, or museum,
of the main building was adopted by the committee, but was never
constructed.

Secretary Henry’s part in the above changes is thus referred to in -
his report for 1849:

The plan of the Smithsonian building was designed by the architect and recom-
mended to the Board by a committee of the Regents before the programme of organi-
zation was adopted. It is not strange, therefore, when the building came to be

occupied, that changes in the internal arrangement should be deemed advisable,
which would better adapt it to the wants of the Institution. Such changes, at my

suggestion, have been made; and for the propriety of these I am responsible. They
are principally, however, those of simplification, and in themselves add nothing to
the cost of the edifice. An increased expense, however, will arise out of the furnish-
ing of new rooms which haye been acquired by the alterations.

1850.

The operations during 1850, as shown by the building committee's
report, were mainly directed toward the completion of the exterior.
The central building was roofed and slated, and inclosed in such man-
ner as to be perfectly protected from the weather. The principal
front tower was carried up to a height of 122 feet and covered in
temporarily for the winter. The lower central tower was completed.
The campanile and northeast corner towers were roofed in. The cen-
tral south tower was carried to a height of 40 feet, and the southeast
and southwest corner towers were built to the height of the cornice of
the cell of the main building.

At this time Secretary Henry reported on the general state of the
finances as follows:

Aiter all the expenditures which have been made on the building, grounds, publi-
cations, researches, purchase of books and apparatus, not only is the original bequest
untouched, but there is now on hand upward of $200,000 of accrued interest. This
will be sufficient to finish the exterior of the building, including all the towers, the
interior of the wings, ranges, and a part of the interior of the main edifice; which

will afford sufficient accommodation for some years to come, and leave $150,000 to
be added to the principal.

On February 26, 1850, a portion of the interior framing and floors
of that part of the main building intended to contain the museum of
apparatus, fell into the basement, and a meeting of the building com-
mittee was immediately called to examine into the conditions. This
accident also led to a meeting of the Regents on March 2, at which the
following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the building committee be requested to take under consideration the
reports of the architect, superintendent, and contractor, on the subject of the late
accident; that they associate with them Professor Bache, General Totten, the Secre-
tary of the Institution, and some competent and entirely impartial arc hitect or archi-
tects; that they make a survey of the whole building, report the manner, faithful-
ness, and sec urity in which the building contract has hitherto been exec uted, and
upon the plan most proper, in their estimation, to re pair the damages and finish that
portion of the building in which the accident h: appened and other unfinished por-
tions thereof.

The committee so designated reported on July 3, 1850, its principal
conclusions and recommendations being as follows:

1. That the workmanship of the cut stone of the exterior is good, and the masonry
generally, though in some respects not of the best quality, is of a passable character
ce reference to the terms of the contract.

. That the interior of the main building is defective in the kind of materials orig-
a adopted, and to a considerable degree in the quality of the materials employed.
202 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

These consist principally of wood, and are not of a proper character for a building
intended to contain valuable deposits, many of which will be donations to the insti-
tution, presented with the implied condition that they are to be properly secured
against danger from fire. This mode of construction was probably adopted by the
original building committee, in order to lessen the cost of the edifice and to bring it
within the sum appropriated by the Board.

3. Although the committee are anxious to save the accrued interest, and to devote
it to objects more in accordance with the spirit of the original bequest than the eree-
tion of a costly building; yet, they would recommend that the interior work of the
center building, as now existing, be removed, and that there be substituted for it a
fireproof structure, in accordance with the plan recommended in the reports of Mr.
Renwick and of the commission of architects.

4. The completion of the building on this plan, according to the estimate of the
commission, requires an additional outlay of about $44,000. To meet this additional
expense, the committee recommend the adoption of the suggestion of their chairman,
Colonel Davis, that the exterior of the building and the interior of the towers be com-
pleted in accordance with the plan and within the time specified by the contract,
and that the remainder of the interior be finished agreeably to the new plan, in the
course of a number of years, and in such portions as can be paid for out of the annual
interest of the Smithsonian fund, not otherwise appropriated. The object of this
part of the proposition is to prevent the derangement of the plan of finance origi-
nally proposed by Doctor Bache and adopted by the Board of Regents, viz, of saving
sut of the accrued and accruing interest, after paying for the building, the sum of
$150,000, to be added to the principal.

5. By the addendum to the contract, the Regents have the power of stopping the
building at any stage of its progress on paying the contractor pro rata for the work
done, according to the prices specified in the contract, and allowing for reasonable
damages if the circumstances require the payment of them. The estimates in this
case are to be made by the architect of the institution or other architects selected
by the Regents. But with reference to the quality of the work which has been
done, it is the opinion of the legal adviser of the committee that the decision of the
architect of the building is final, both with regard to the Regents and the contractor.

6. In accordance with the forementioned stipulations of the contract, the commit-
tee have requested Mr. Renwick to furnish an estimate pro rata for completing the
whole exterior of the building and the interior of the towers, making deductions
for materials and workmanship which he would have condemned had the building
been completed according to the original plan. The following is the decision of the
architect, which has been agreed to by the contractor, with the understanding
that nothing is to be paid him on account of profit on work omitted by the proposed
change, viz:

For finishing the whole exterior of the building, all the interior rooms of
EhHetowers andy ot thet yam os! thes urrae Ole ee ee $185, 154

7. The committee recommend to the Board of Regents that they agree to this
proposition, and that a resolution be adopted directing the contractor to proceed with
the work in accordance therewith. In recommending this course to the Board, the
committee act in conformity with the advice of two of the commission of architects,
viz: Mr. EK. B. White and Mr. J. R. Niernsee, who undertook the examination in
detail of the parts of the building, and gave an estimate as the basis of an equitable
settlement.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 203

8. By adopting the above sum of $185,154 as the amount to be paid to the con-
tractor, Mr. Renwick gives the following estimate of the cost of finishing the building
in accordance with the fireproof plan, viz:

Norr.—The foregoing estimates are exclusive of the salaries of the architect and
superintendent; also of the cost of the improvement of the grounds and part of the
furniture.

This last sum is greater than the preceding by $8,331. The difference, according
to the statement of Mr. Renwick, is due to the various deductions he has made on
account of defective materials, imperfect workmanship, and changes in the plan.

In conclusion, the committee are fully of opinion—and in this they are sustained
by the commission of architects—that, by adopting the plan of fire-proofing proposed
by Mr. Renwick and the proposition of the contractor, the building will be ren-
dered safe and durable at a very reasonable cost, considering the amount of work
which has been bestowed upon it.

The committee do not consider it necessary to offer any remarks on the cause of the
accident which led to these investigations. If these recommendations be adopted,
the whole structure of the interior of the main building in which the accident
occurred will be exchanged for one more in accordance with the permanence and
utility of the edifice, and in this case they will consider the accident as a fortunate
event.

1851.

In view of the report of the special committee following the acci-
dent in 1850, the Regents found it necessary to deviate from their
original intention, and to order the removal of the woodwork which
had been erected in the interior of the main building and direct that
its place be supplied by fireproof materials. During 1851 all the exte-
rior of the building, including the towers, was completed. Some
minor changes in interior construction, insuring better fireproofing,
was also arranged for.

At a meeting of the Regents on February 27, 1851, it was resolved
that the executive committee be requested to ie into the feasi-
bility of providing buildings for the residences of the officers of the
204 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Institution on the Smithsonian grounds or other convenient location,
and, if they deem expedient, to report plans and estimates for such
buildings to the Board at their next meeting. The reply of the execu-
tive committee, made on May 1, 1852, was as follows:

That after due reflection they have come to the conclusion that it would conduce
very much to the interests of the Institution if the officers were provided with
houses on the Smithsonian grounds, so that they might be present on all occasions
and be as much as possible at all times identified with the operations of the Institu-
tion; yet at present, while the main edifice is unfinished, they do not consider it
advisable to incur the expense of additional buildings, and would therefore recom-
mend that in lieu of the rent of a house $500 be added to the salaries of Professors
Jewett and Baird, to be paid from the beginning of the present year.

1852.

In this year the contract with Gilbert Cameron, including the finish-
ing of the exterior of the entire building and the interior of the wings,
connecting ranges, and towers, was declared completed, leaving the
whole interior of the main building to be finished. All the woodwork
and plastering of the interior of the main building was, by resolution
of the Board, to be removed and its place supplied by fireproof mate-
rials. Mr. Renwick withdrew his services, as it was not thought best
to continue his salary, and Capt. B. S. Alexander, U. S. Corps of
Engineers, was employed to prepare detailed drawings and plans for
the balance of the work.

Referring to this subject in his report for 1852, Secretary Henry
wrote:

From the report of the building committee it appears that the contract for finishing
the interior of the wings and ranges and the rooms of the towers has been completed.
The whole interior of the main building, comprising a rectangular space of 200 feet
long, 50 wide, and about 60 high, remains to be finished with fireproof materials.
It is proposed to divide this space into two stories and a basement. These stories
will be devoted to the library, the museum, and a large and convenient lecture
room.

The business of the Institution would be much facilitated were this part of the
building completed. Since Congress has authorized the establishment of a library
and museum, it will be well to place all the objects of interest to the public in the
main building and make this exclusively the show part of the establishment, devot-
ing the wings and ranges and rooms of the towers to the business operations and
other purposes of the Institution. In the present condition of affairs there is no part
of the edifice to which the public has not access, and, consequently, business has to be
transacted amidst constant interruptions. The loss of time and effective life to which
all are exposed who occupy a position of notoriety in the city of Washington is truly
lamentable, and where this is enhanced by facility of access to gratify mere curiosity
the evil becomes scarcely endurable. Progress in business under such circumstances
can only be made by an encroachment on the hours usually allotted to rest, and
that, too, at the expense of wasted energies and shortened days.

1853.

Mr. Gilbert Cameron was given the contract for completing the
structure in-accordance with his previous terms, and the building
committee kept constantly in view the idea of rendering the main
building entirely fireproof and of constructing it in the most durable
and substantial manner. These changes of arrangements delayed
work until June 13, 1853, from which time onward it was actively
prosecuted. The committee found great difficulty in deciding upon
a proper position and plan of a large lecture room, but finally con-
cluded to place it in the second story in the middle of the main build-
ing, where the greatest width could be obtained.

1854.

At the close of 1854 the building committee reported that the main
or center building was finished, with the exception of a few unim-
portant additions. Many changes had been required for the better
security and adaptation of the building, and they involved an addi-

tional expense.
1855.

During this year the entire edifice was completed, and the final
report of the architect was approved by the committee. The follow-
ing account of the interior of the building at this time is taken from
Secretary Henry’s report for 1855, with some annotations from the
report of the building committee:

The building is at length completed, and its several apartments are now in a con-
dition to be applied to the uses of the Institution. As various changes have been
made in the original plan, the following brief description may not be inappropriate at
this time. It consists of a main edifice, two wings, two connecting ranges, four large
projecting towers, and several smaller ones. Its extreme length from east to west is
447 feet, with a breadth varying from 49 feet to 160 feet. The interior of the east
wing is separated into two stories, the upper of which is divided into a suite of rooms
for the accommodation of the family of the Secretary. The lower story principally
comprises a large single room, at present appropriated to the storage of publications
and the reception and distribution of books connected with the system of exchange.
The upper story of the eastern connecting range is divided into a number of small
apartments devoted to the operations in natural history, and the lower story is fitted
up as a working laboratory.

The interior of the main edifice is 200 feet long by 50 feet wide? and consists of
two stories and a basement. The upper story is divided into a lecture room capable
of holding 2,000 persons ¢ and into two additional rooms, one on either side, each 50

“Seventy-five feet by 45 feet.

>And 60 feet high from the basement floor to the upper ceiling.

‘The lecture room, the optical and acoustic properties of which are probably
unsurpassed by any apartment intended for the same purpose in the United States,
occupies one-half of the upper story of the main building, besides a portion of the
front and rear towers. Its precise length is 96 feet and extreme width 62 feet. It
will comfortably seat 1,500 persons, and when crowded will contain upward of 2,000.
206 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

feet square, one of which is appropriated to a museum of apparatus and the other,
at present, toa gallery of art. Both are occasionally used as minor lecture rooms
and for the meetings of scientific, educational, or industrial associations.

The lower story of the main building consists of one large hall, to be appropriated
to a museum ora library. It is at present unoccupied, but will be brought into use
as soon as the means are provided for furnishing it with proper cases for containing
the objects to which it may be appropriated. @

The basement of this portion of the building is used as a lumber room and as a
receptacle for fuel.

The west wing is at present occupied as a library, and is sufficiently large to
accommodate all the books which will probably be received during the next ten
years. The west connecting range is appropriated to a reading room.

The principal towers are divided into stories, and thus furnish a large number of
rooms of different sizes, which will all come into use in the varied operations of the
Institution. A large room in the main south tower is appropriated to the meetings
of the ‘‘ Establishment’’ and the Board of Regents; three rooms in one range, in the
main front towers, are used as offices; and two rooms below, in the same towers, are
occupied by one of the assistants and the janitor; other rooms in the towers are used
for drawing, engraving, and workshops. There are in the whole building, of all
sizes, 90 different apartments; of these 8 are of a large size, and are intended for
public exhibitions.

The delay in finishing the building has not only been attended with advantage in
husbanding the funds, but also in allowing a more complete adaptation of the inte-
rior to the purposes of the Institution. It is surely better, in the construction of
such an edifice, to imitate the example of the mollusk, who, in fashioning his shell,
adapts it to the form and dimensions of his body, rather than that of another animal
who forces himself into a house intended for a different occupant. The first point

be settled in commencing a building is the uses to which it is to be applied.
This, however, could not be definitely ascertained at the beginning of the Institution,
and hence the next wisest step to that of not commencing to build immediately was
to defer the completion of the structure until the plan of operations and the wants of
the establishment were more precisely known.

* * * The whole amount expended on the building, grounds, and objects con-
nected with them is $318,727.01. This exceeds considerably the original estimate
and the limit which was at first adopted by the Regents.

The excess has been principally occasioned by substituting fire-proof materials for
the interior of the main building instead of wood and plaster, which were originally
intended.

* * * We should not forget that the ordinary expenses of the Institution have
constantly increased, and that, while the nominal income has remained the same,
the value of money has Coe iated; and, consequat the SONS of the original

the middle of the space corresponding to the principal entrances are two wing walls,
by which, with the addition of screens, the whole space may be divided into two
large rooms, with a hall extending across the building between them. This story
may be used fora library or a museum, or for both, as the wants of the Institution
may require. It is finished in a simple but chaste style and has received general
commendation. Indeed, it is, perhaps, in appearance one of the most imposing
rooms in this country, apart from adaptation to its purposes. The floor through
the middle part is formed of cut stone, that of the other parts is of wood, which,

bequest to produce results has been abridged in a corresponding proportion. Besides,
when the building is entirely occupied, the expense of warming, attendance, etc.,
must necessarily be much increased beyond its present amount. The repairs, on
account of the peculiar style of architecture adopted, will ever be a heavy item of
expenditure. The several pinnacles, buttresses, and intersecting roofs all afford
points of peculiar exposure to the injuries of the weather.

1857.

In 1857 the building committee stated that at its last session Congress
had appropriated $15,000 for cases for the collections belonging to the
Government. These were then finished and formed a beautiful addi-
tion to the large hall on the first floor, being apparently well adapted
to the purpose intended. The west wing, devoted to the library, had
been furnished with alcoves and a gallery extending around three
sides of the room, an arrangement serving to increase greatly the
accommodation and security of the books.

No report was made by the building committee after this year.

1858.
In his report for 1858 Secretary Henry states that—

In order to increase the capacity of the large room appropriated to the collection,
the cases have been arranged in two stories, forming a series of alcoves and a gallery
on each side. By the adoption of this plan space can be provided for double the

number of specimens which were exhibited at the Patent Office.
% * * * * * 75

Comparatively few repairs have been required during the past year on the build-
ing, though the changes which have been necessary to accommodate the increasing
operations of the Institution have involved considerable expense. The corridors,
which were entirely open to the northwest wind, have been inclosed with glazed
sashes; a large amount of space has thus been rendered available, and a considerable
portion of the interior of the building protected from the inclemency of the weather.

During this year the Government collections at the Patent Office
were transferred to the lower main hall of the Smithsonian building,
in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress of August
10, 1846.

FIRE OF 1865, AND RESTORATION OF THE BUILDING.

On January 24, 1865, the building of the Smithsonian Institution
was visited by a destructive fire, which burned out the upper story of
the main building and the large towers at the north and south
entrances. The following account of this disaster is taken from Sec-
retary Henry’s report for 1865:

The most important event of 1865 was the destruction of a part of the building and
its contents by the fire of January 24. This event must continue to form an epoch
in the history of the Institution; and though it can not but be considered a most
serious disaster, it may yet lead to changes of importance in the correction of ten-
dencies which might ultimately have absorbed the annual income and neutralized
the more liberal policy which has thus far been pursued. In view, therefore, of the
character of the event, as well as the continuity of the history, it is deemed expe-
208 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

dient, before proceeding with an account of the operations of the year, to repeat
briefly the facts connected with the origin and results of the fire.

It may be well, however, for the better information of those not acquainted with
the Smithsonian building, to premise in regard to it the following particulars: It
consists of a main edifice 200 feet long and 50 wide, with two large wings and two
connecting ranges, having in all an extreme length, in an east and west direction,
of 450 feet. In front and rear of the middle portion are projections, terminated by
high towers, two on the north and one on the south side; moreover, on each corner
of the middle building is a smaller tower, and also one on each of the two wings.

The whole of the first story of the main building, in a single room, is devoted to
the museum; the upper story, in three apartments, was assigned to the lecture room,
the gallery of art, and the cabinet of apparatus. The west wing is entirely appro-
priated to the library; the east wing to the residence of the Secretary and a store-
room for publications and specimens of natural history. The east connecting range
contains the laboratory and office rooms; the west range is an extension of the
museum. In the large towers were the Regents’ room, the offices of the Secretary,
storerooms, and workshop.

Though the original plan was much admired for its architectural effect, it was
soon found that, in relation to the means at the disposal of the building committee,
it was too expensive to admit in its construction of the exclusive use of fire-proof
materials; hence, while the exterior was to be constructed of cut freestone, it was
concluded to finish the interior in wood and stueco. Fortunately, this plan, which
was carried out in regard to the wings, the connecting ranges, and the towers, was
abandoned before the completion of the main building. After the exterior of this,
including the roof, had been finished and the framing of the interior was in place,
the latter suddenly gave way and was precipitated into the cellar—a mass of broken
timber. The attention of the Regents having been called by this accident to the
insecurity of the woodwork, they directed that the further progress of the building
should be stopped until means could be accumulated for finishing the remainder of
the edifice in a more stable manner and with fire-proof materials. In accordance
with this direction, after an interval of several years, the construction was recom-
menced under the direction of Capt. (now Gen.) B. 8. Alexander, of the Engineer
Corps, and the whole of the main building, except the inside of the towers and the
framing of the roof, which had previously been completed, was finished in a sub-
stantial manner in iron and brick work. The architect advised the removal of the
roof, but as this would have swelled the cost of the building still further beyond the
estimate and the means at command, and as the covering was of slate, the framing
under it was thought to be in no danger from fire. This, however, was destined to
be the part on which the first attack of the element was to be made. Through a
mistake in some workmen, the pipe of a stove which had been temporarily used in
one of the upper rooms was introduced through the wall into a furring space resem-
bling a flue, but which discharged the heated air from the combustion iuto the loft
immediately under the roof, instead of into the air through the true chimney.@

Indian portraits had been fitted out with about 200 feet of cases around the walls to
receive the ethnological specimens in the possession of the Institution. While
engaged in rearranging the pictures above these cases, the workmen, with a view to
their own comfort, unfortunately placed the pipe of a stove in a ventilating flue
which opened under the roof, and thus caused the conflagration which destroyed
the upper part of the main building. Fortunately, none of the ethnological articles
had been placed in this room, and consequently these specimens, with those of the,
museum and of the general collections, have been preserved. (Secretary Henry.
Report for 1864, p. 31.)
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 209

The rafters were set on fire, and before the burning was discovered the entire wood-
work under the covering was in flames. The progress of the fire was so rapid that
but few of the contents of the upper rooms could be removed before the roof fell in.
The flames soon extended to the large towers, and, as these acted as high chimneys,
they greatly increased the intensity of the combustion. The conflagration was only
stayed by the incombustible materials of the main building. Had the original plan
of constructing the interior of the edifice in wood and plaster been fully carried out,
the whole structure would have been destroyed and the valuable library and rich
collections of specimens of natural history entirely lost.

The aperture which deceived the workmen was probably made by those who origi-
nally plastered the building. It occupied a middle point between two windows, and
from its position would naturally lead to the inference that it was designed to con-
duct the products of combustion directly into the chimney, from which it was only
separated by the thickness of a single brick. For what reason it had not been
placed in the middle between the two windows is unknown. It is remembered that
some ten years previous to the fire this opening was during several weeks used for

the insertion of a stove pipe, without suspicion of accident at the time; but in the
interval the wood had undergone a process of drying which rendered it more com-
bustible. :

Constantly impressed with the fact that the interior of the two wings and the con-
necting ranges were constructed of combustible material, I have always felt great
anxiety on account of the liability to conflagration of these parts of the building.
The rest of the edifice, with the exception of the interior of the towers, was sup-
posed to be secure from injury of this nature. A night watch was constantly kept,
barrels and buckets filled with water were placed at suitable points, and strict rules
were adopted prohibiting the carrying of exposed lights, as well as the practice of
smoking, in any part of the edifice. That these precautions were unavailing has been
seen, the fire having been communicated at a point where danger was least sus-
pected, and in a manner which rendered its occurrence sooner or later almost
inevitable.

The weather at the time was extremely cold, and before the engines could be
brought into operation the whole of the roof was in flames. Commencing at the
west end of the center building, the flames were driven by the wind, which blew
from that direction eastwardly, and, fortunately, away from the library, in the west
wing. The destruction of the roof of the main building involved that of the con-
tents of the rooms immediately beneath it and also those of the three principal
towers adjacent. In the former were the Indian portrait gallery, the lecture room,
and the apparatus room. The first of these contained the large collection of paint-
ings by Mr. Stanley and a series of Indian portraits belonging to the Government.
The lecture room was constructed on acoustic and optical principles, and not only
answered perfectly the ends for which it was immediately intended, but had served
also as a model for lecture rooms in various parts of the country. The apparatus
room contained the principal part of the articles presented by the late Dr. Robert
Hare, and a large number of instruments of recent construction intended both for
illustration and original research.

The losses in the south tower were, first, the contents of the Regents’ room,
including the personal effects of Smithson; second, those of a large room above it, in
which were stored the private library of Reverend Doctor Johns, of Virginia, and the
public library of Beaufort, South Carolina, deposited there at the request of Hon. Mr.
Stanton, for preservation until the end of the war; and, third, in the attic, a large col-
lection of public documents and complete sets of the Smithsonian Reports, intended
for distribution. The effects of Smithson had but little intrinsic value, and were
chiefly prized as mementos of the founder of the Institution. They consisted of a
number of articles of chemical and physical apparatus, such as were used by him in

210 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

his perambulatory excursions, two small cabinets of minute specimens of minerals,
a silver-plated dinner service, and a trunk filled with manuscripts. The portrait
of Smithson while a student at Oxford, a medallion likeness of him in bronze, his
library, consisting of 150 volumes, and asmall painting were saved. The manuscripts
consisted principally of notes on scraps of paper, intended apparently for alphabetical
arrangement in acommonplace book, after the manner of a philosophical dictionary.

The losses in the north towers were the contents of the offices of the Secretary,

including the records and copies of the correspondence of the Institution, the wood-
cuts to illustrate the publications, the steel plates of an expensive memoir, several
boxes of stereotype plates, a large number of manuscripts of the Secretary on scien-
tific subjects, four memoirs accepted for publication, about a hundred volumes of
valuable books from the library, used for constant and immediate reference; a large
number of copies of the Smithsonian Reports and duplicate documents; the contents
of the workshop, consisting of a lathe, forge, a full set of tools, and an assortment of
hardware and materials for the construction and repair of apparatus; and of the
upper room of the highest tower, including the clockwork of an anemometer for
recording the direction and force of the wind. Not only was this instrument itself
lost, but all the records which had been obtained by the use of it for the last seven
years. Fortunately, nearly all the other meteorological records, which were in a
lower room, were saved.

The Indian portraits, as far as they were the likenesses of particular individuals, in
most cases can never be reproduced, but we are gratified to learn that the extensive
collection of Mr. Catlin of a similar character has been purchased in Europe by Mr.
Harrison, of Philadelphia, and will be rendered accessible to the student of ethnology.
Besides this, there are in existence, particularly in Canada, other portraits sufficient
in number and variety fully to illustrate the characteristics of the race. At the same
time the loss has fallen very heavily upon Mr. Stanley, the painter and owner of
this collection. It was the result of the labor of many years among the Indians; it
constituted the pride, as it has been the crowning effort, of his life, and he ardently
desired that it might be transmitted to posterity asa monument of his enterprise and
industry. The hope is entertained that the Government will see fit to give him an
order to paint a picture for the Capitol, in which the principal figures of this collec-
tion and the characteristics of the Indian race may be portrayed.

The apparatus presented by Doctor Hare was interesting on account of its associa-
tion with the history of the advance of science in this country. The collection con-
tained most of the articles invented by the donor, and which are described in the
scientific journals of the first half of the present century. Among the chemical
implements were those used by that distinguished chemist in procuring for the first
time, without the aid of galvanism, calcium, the metallic basis of ime. A number
of the articles of apparatus presented by Doctor Hare, though injured by the fire,
may be repaired, and I have taken measures for their restoration.

Among the articles of historic interest which were lost is the lens used by Priest-
ley for the evolution of oxygen from the oxide of mercury, and by means of which
the first distinct recognition of this elementary substance was effected. It had been
presented to the Institution by the nephew of the celebrated philosopher, as was
also the apparatus employed by Priestley in his experiments on bodies in condensed
atmospheres. The latter was but slightly injured and can readily be repaired. The
other articles of apparatus may be replaced at an expense of about $10,000.

The most irreparable loss was that of the records, consisting of the official, scien-
tific, and miscellaneous correspondence, embracing 35,000 pages of copied letters
which had been sent, at least 30,060 of which were the composition of the Secretary,
and 50,000 pages of letters received by the Institution; the receipts for publications
and specimens; reports on various subjects which haye been referred to the Institu-
tion; the records of experiments instituted by the Secretary for the Government;
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. Oat

four manuscripts of original in vestigations which had been adopted by the Institu-
tion for publication; a large number of papers and scientific notes of the Secretary;
a series of diaries and memorandum and account books. Fortunately, however, a
detailed history of the general operations of the Institution is preserved in the
printed reports, and a large amount of correspondence connected with natural his-
tory and meteorology was saved.

Since the occurrence of the fire all the sae have been carried on in the lower
story of the east wing of the building (the upper part still continuing to be the resi-
dence of the Secretary) and in the several rooms of the adjoining east range. Con-
nected with an office in the latter, the lower story of the tower attached to the
southeast corner of the main building has been converted into a fireproof vault, in
which all the valuable papers and records are constantly kept, except for the usually
short time they are required for consultation. To insure the wakefulness and fidelity
of the watchmen we have introduced the use of an instrument called a ‘‘detector,’’
which records the number and the times of his visits to the several parts of the
building. For this instrument, which has rendered good service during the past
year, we are indebted to the liberality of its inventor, Mr. J. E. Bauerk, of Boston,
who, in consideration of the loss which the Institution has sustained by fire, kindly
presented it free of charge.

A circumstantial account is given by the building committee of what has been
done toward the reconstruction of the edifice. From this it will be seen that the
plan adopted contemplates not merely the repair of the damage by the fire, but the
restoration of the several parts in fireproof materials, and with such alterations in
the division of the interior space as will better adapt it to the uses of the Institution.

The plans have been prepared and the work superintended by Mr. Adolph Cluss,
an architect who was warmly recommended by the mayor of Washington as having
been successful in designing and erecting the public schoolhouses of the city, as well
as a number of churches and other buildings. These plans have been critically
examined and, in some cases, modified by the chairman of the building committee,
General Delafield, who, by his knowledge and experience in the line of engineering,
has rendered the Institution valuable service.

No appropriation has yet been made by Congress to aid in the restoration of the
building. Considering, however, the large amount of Government property intrusted
to the care of the Institution, it can scarcely be doubted that in a normal condition
of the national finances, an appropriation for such purpose would haye been readily
granted.

In consideration of the extraordinary outlay required for the reconstruction of the
building, an effort has been made to reduce as much as possible the miscellaneous
expenses, and to engage in no enterprise that is not absolutely necessary to the con-
tinuance of the general operations. So many articles, however, of furniture and
stores of hardware and stationery were to be replaced that we have not been able to
reduce the expenditures to as low a point as we could wish; yet it will be seen that
they fall somewhat below those of the preceding year. * * *

The cost of the restoration of the building in fireproof materials without changing
the external appearance has, as formerly stated, been far greater than was antici-
pated. Whether the portion of the work yet to be executed will much exceed in
cost that which has already been completed will depend upon the price of materials
and of labor. The Institution may in time be able to finish this work without
encroaching on its present capital, provided the Secretary of the Treasury shall
recognize the inadequacy of the payments of interest which for three years were
made in the depreciated currency of the time. If this allowance be not made and
no assistance be received from Congress, then, in order to secure the building and
its contents from injury by the weather the Institution will be obliged to sacrifice a
212 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

portion of its extra fund, and to the extent of this forever diminish its power to
‘“Inerease and diffuse knowledge among men.”’ ;

* * * As the public museum of the Institution occupied the portion of the
building constructed of fireproof materials, it escaped destruction by the fire, yet the
smoke and water to which they were exposed caused some damage to the specimens,
and much labor and expense were requisite to restore them to their proper appear-
ance.

The report of Secretary Henry immediately following the fire con-
tains some important statements, which, though made before those
above quoted, can better supplement them. They are partly as
follows:

Although greatly to be regretted on account of the losses incurred, the accident is
not without compensation in considerations of a different nature; thus it has served
to call forth the expression of a large amount of kind feeling in regard to the Institu-
tion and to direct the attention of Congress to the character and importance of its
operations.

* * * Two grave errors were committed in the adoption of the present one
[building]; first, the plan was but little adapted to the uses to which the edifice was
to be applied; second, the style of architecture required a far greater expenditure
than the amount to which the cost of the building was limited. For the purpose of
architectural effect the interior was very inconveniently divided. The buttresses,

turrets, and towers, while they add very little to the accommodation of the building,
greatly increased the cost. To haye constructed the building in a substantial
and durable manner in strict conformity with the Lombard style of architecture,
which was adopted, would haye required an expenditure of at least double the
amount of the sum appropriated for the purpose. It was therefore necessary, in
order that the exterior might be constructed of freestone, that the interior should be
finished in wood and stucco, and that thus recourse should be had to the presenta-
tion of a falsehood to the eye in the very inauguration of an enterprise for the
advancement of truth. The two wings and the two connecting ranges were com-
pleted in this manner. The main building, which is 200 feet long and 50 feet wide,
embellished with six towers, was also in process of completion, the framing of the
interior having been finished, when the underpinning gave way and the whole of
the woodwork fell to the ground.

After the occurrence of this accident a commission of architects appointed to
examine the building reported that the exterior walls were well built, both in
regard to construction and materials, but that the plan of finishing the interior
in wood and stucco was improper for an edifice intended to contain valuable articles.
It was therefore recommended that fireproof materials should be employed for the
portions of the work which remained to be constructed. In conformity with this
recommendation the interior of the main building was completed in iron, stone, and
brick, with the exception of the roof, which, being covered with slate and not sup-
posed to be exposed to danger from fire, was suffered to remain. It was this change
in the mode of constructing a portion of the edifice which, during the late fire, saved
the contents of the whole from destruction. It however increased the cost of the
building to upward of $300,000, leaving the remaining parts of the interior of the
structure in perishable materials.

* * * Nothing definite can be said at present as to the financial arrangements
for the repair of the building. The subject is still before Congress, and although the
idea has been confidently entertained that an appropriation would be made for the
purpose, yet, from the discussion which took place in the meeting of the joint com-
mittee of the two Houses appointed to consider this matter, I do not think a resolu-
tion authorizing such an appropriation will be adopted.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. ae

The first meeting of the Regents after the fire was held on January
28, 1865, having been called principally in consequence of that event.
The Secretary presented a brief account of the fire, and of the steps
immediately taken, through the Secretary of War, to place a tempo-
rary roof over the main building. This work was done under the
Quartermaster’s Department of the Army, which furnished the neces-
sary materials and men, the expense being subsequently refunded by
the Institution. This roof was adequate to protect the building from
storms without interfering with the construction of a permanent
covering.

It was announced that the committees on Public Buildings and
Grounds of both the Senate and House had already been directed to
inquire into the origin of the fire, the approximate loss to the Goy-
ernment and to private persons, the means necessary to preserve the
remaining portions, ete. In anticipation of the work of these com-
mittees it was thought advisable that a special committee be appointed
to report directly to the Board, Mr. R. Wallach, a Regent, and Pro-
fessor Henry, the Secretary, being designated as such committee,
under the following resolution :

That a committee be appointed to inquire into the origin of the fire, to ascertain

the extent and character of the loss sustained, and to make suggestions as to what
measures should be adopted for the repair and improvement of the building.

The report of this committee, submitted at a Board meeting on
February 2, 1865, after reciting the origin of the fire and explaining
the losses sustained (amounting, besides the damage to the building,
to about $20,000 for the Institution and $26,000 for individuals), as
well as the parts saved from injury, all of which have been sufliciently
described above, made the following suggestions as to what they con-
sidered should be done.

There can be no hesitation in adopting the conclusion that steps should be imme-
diately taken not only to repair the injury, but to improve the condition of the
building.

1. The main edifice should be provided with a metallic roof.

2. For the wooden conical terminations of the towers should be substituted metallic
coverings.

3. All valuable articles belonging to the Institution or deposited in it, including
the library, should be placed i in the main building, which should be cut off from the
wings by iron doors.

4. Provision should be made for a thorough heating of the whole building by steam
or hot water.

5. Suggestions should be requested from competent architects and engineers as to
work to be done, and those which are adopted should be embodied in working plans
and drawings.

6. A building committee of the Board should be appointed to have charge of the
work.

No very exact estimate can as yet be made as to the cost of the repairs, etc., for it
has not been possible, without erecting a scaffolding, to determine whether it will be

necessary to take down the high northern tower. Colonel Alexander, of the Engineer
Corps, however, has informed the committee that he thinks $100,000 will be required
to make the necessary repairs and improvements.

The committee can not conclude without adding that, in their opinion, the occur-
rence of the fire ought not to be allowed to interfere with the active operations of
the Institution, on which essentially depends the reputation it has established
throughout the world and its efficiency as an instrument for ‘‘the inerease and dif-
fusion of knowledge among men.’’ To the support and extension of these opera-
tions, therefore, the annual interest from the original fund should, as far as possible,
continue as heretofore to be conscientiously applied.

At the same meeting measures were discussed for the repair and
improvement of the building, and the opinion was expressed by the
Congressional Regents present that an appropriation for the purpose
would be made by Congress without opposition, but such relief was
not obtained.

The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives,
above referred to, made its report to Congress on February 21, 1865,
after visiting the building, having adopted the report of the Smith-
sonian committee. Ata subsequent meeting of the joint Congressional
committee Secretary Henry was requested to describe his connection
with the Institution, to give an account of its objects and operations,
the origin of the building, and such other facts as might be of public
interest. Secretary Henry’s statement, together with the report of

. a . * . Owed C
the committees and of the testimony, were printed conjointly as Senate
Report No. 129, Thirty-eighth Congress, second session, February,
1865.

At a meeting held on March 1, 1865, it was resolved by the Regents:
‘*That the whole subject of the repairs and reconstruction of the
building * * * be intrusted to the Chancellor, the Secretary, and
the executive committee.” This committee reported annually during
the three years from 1866 to 1868, inclusive, and the following extracts
are from that source:

1865. The first step toward the reconstruction of the building was to secure the
services of a competent person as architect and engineer to prepare plans and super-
intend the work. For this purpose Mr. Adolph Cluss, who had designed and
directed the building of the principal schoolhouses of the city, was employed.

The next thing to be done was the making of a critical survey to ascertain the
actual state of the walls, and to determine what parts it was necessary first to rebuild.
This survey forced upon the committee the conviction that the original construction
of the building, as a whole, was very defective, and, in many respects, unsuited as ¢
receptacle of records and other valuable articles, the loss of which could never be
repaired. The exterior of all the walls consists of a facing of red sandstone, bound
to an irregular backing of bluestone of very bad workmanship. In the main build-
ing and in the lower portion of the large south tower was inserted a 4-inch brick
lining separated by an air space from the main walls. This lining is not bound to
the walls, and, therefore, does not add to their strength. It is merely a furring,
intended to prevent dampness by the condensation of moisture from the atmosphere.
This furring is open at the top, and it was into this that the stovepipe was inserted
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 915

which led to the accident by fire. In all the other rooms of the towers the plaster-
ing was upon the rough rubble work.

The heavy projecting cornice of the south tower was merely set in place without
fastening, and, consequently, could not withstand any disturbing action.

The parts of the building which were not injured by fire, namely, the two wings
and connecting ranges, as far as the committee have had the opportunity of examin-
ing, are defective in materials and construction. The floors, in some cases, though
covered with flagging and filled in with deafening, rest upon beams of pine wood,
which is decayed, and in the course of a few years the interior of these parts will
require renewal.

It is proper to state that the foregoing remarks on the character of the materials
and the construction of the building are not applicable to the work on the main edi-
fice, subsequently executed under the superintendence of Capt. (now General) B.S.
Alexander, of the United States Engineers. This work, which principally consisted
in the arching of the basement and the main story of the upper building, was exe-
cuted in fireproof materials and prevented the extension of the fire, and, conse-
quently, the destruction of the entire edifice and all its contents.

From the foregoing account of the original construction of the building, it will not
be surprising that the effect of the fire was found to be much more serious than pre-
vious to this survey it had been supposed, and that the work to be done could not
be confined to the mere repairing of the injury caused by the fire, but would include
also the rebuilding of a considerable part of the edifice; and this was particularly the
case on account of the decision of the Board that the restoration should be in all
parts indestructible by fire.

The heavy projecting cornice of the south tower had fallen down, in part, and the
remainder was unfit to receive a new roof.

The high brick columns, extending from the cellar to the eaves of the main building,
‘and supporting the northern wall of the south tower, were so much damaged by the
fire as to require to be removed, and consequently, with them the above-mentioned
wall itself. The lining of the upper story of the main building was also so much
injured that the greater portion of this will require renewal. But the most unstable
portion of the building, and that which gave rise to most anxiety, was the prin-
cipal northern tower. This, which is 140 feet high, starts from a square base, and
is gradually transformed into a regular octagon of smaller dimensions. Four sides
of this octagon rest upon the sides of the original square, but project into the inte-
rior, while its other four sides extend diagonally across the angles of the square,
and are supported by rough and imperfect corbel work, consisting of masses of blue-
stone very seriously affected by the fire. The tower was originally divided into a
series of stories by transverse wooden beams and plank floors, which were entirely
destroyed. The anxiety in regard to this tower was increased by observing a vertical
crack extending a considerable portion of the height of the tower, but whether this
had previously been produced by unequal settling, and had merely been increased
by the unequal expansion of the exterior and interior walls, due to the fire, or
entirely produced by the latter cause, could not be definitely ascertained. As this
part of the building imperatively demanded immediate care, the architect was
directed to give it his first attention. After a due consideration of its then present
condition and its future use as a receptacle of heavy articles, it was considered neces-
sary to erect within it a lining of solid brickwork 9 inches thick, laid in cement,
from the bottom to the top, firmly united to the original wall, and serying as the
support to iron beams of the brick floor. And, furthermore, it was concluded to fill
up in brickwork a number of the high, narrow windows in each story, which would
add to the strength of the structure without affecting externally its architectural
appearance.
216 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

A similar construction was directed in the other principal north tower, and the
work in both has been executed in such a manner as to give assurance that these
parts of the building will not merely be restored, but will also be rendered more
stable than they were before the conflagration. The crack above mentioned has been
found, by the undisturbed condition of a thin stratum of plaster placed over it, to
have remained the same, and the walls, for several months previous and during the
winter, have not undergone any perceptible change.

While the work immediately required for the safety of the front towers was in
progress, plans were discussed and prepared for the interior of these as well as for
that of the south tower, with a view to their better adaptation to the wants of the
establishment.

The original plan of the building included four principal staircases leading to the
upper story of the edifice, one on each side of the north entrance, and a similar
arrangement on the right and another on the left of the south entrance. As these
occupied a large portion of useful space, it was thought best to increase the size of
those at the north entrance, dispense with those on the southern, and so arrange the
heights of the stories of all the towers as to render them more available for the
business operations of the establishment.

The work which has been done on the southern tower consists in the removal of
the north wall and a considerable part of the upper portion of the other three walls;
the preparation of a part of the freestone, from which to reconstruct the exterior
wall; the greater portion of the brickwork of the basement, and the furnishing of
the cast-iron columns intended to replace the brick piers which supported the
northern wall of this tower. * * *

This temporary roof, covered with felt saturated with tar, has served the purpose
intended. It will, however, rapidly deteriorate, and, consequently, the first object
of the committee, during the coming season, will be to decide on the character of
the roof, and to hasten its completion as rapidly as the work can properly be
accomplished.

In the restoration of the building the committee have been governed by the
following considerations:

First. To render the work entirely stable, both in regard to material and mode of
construction.

Second. To render it thoroughly fireproof.

Third. In view of the great cost at present of material and workmanship, and the
condition of the funds of the Institution, at first to do such work as should be
necessary to preserve the stability of the several parts of the building, and prevent
injury to the property by the weather. * * *

1866. The restoration of the building has been prosecuted during the last year as
rapidly as the funds at the disposal of the committee and the character of the work
would permit. * * *

The large south tower was so much injured that 30 feet of the upper portion had
to be taken down and rebuilt, the cost of which was much enhanced by the neces-
sity of recutting a large amount of new stone for the facing. This tower has been
divided into six stories, affording as many large rooms, the lower for an extension
of the museum, an upper one for the meetings of the Regents, and the others for
storage, etc. The offices for the accommodation of the Secretary and assistants will
be in the nothern towers and connecting space.

The principal access to the second story of the main building is by two large iron
staircases, one on either side of the northern entrance. These have been completed.

All the towers and connections with the main building have been covered with
substantial roofs. After much inquiry and personal investigation, it was concluded
to adopt the plan for the roof of the main building of wrought-iron framing and slate
; NATIONAL MUSEUM——BUILDINGS. pe

covering, the latter secured in place by wire to iron purlines and pointed underneath
by a coating of cement.

The inside lining of the walls of the second story of the building, which had been
much injured by the fire, has been removed and its place supplied by a new 9-inch
brick wall laid in cement, securely tied, and clamped to the outer stonework.

The chairman of the committee has given personal attention to the work in its
progress and can state from actual knowledge that the plans, material, and work-
manship are of a satisfactory character, alike creditable to the talents and careful
supervision of Mr. Cluss, the architect.

1867. It was stated in the report presented to the Board at its last session that it
was proposed, during the year 1867, to roof the main building and towers and finish
the interior of all the rooms, halls, staircases, and main entrance, leaving the large
room of the upper story over the museum unfinished until funds could be provided
for the purpose and its future use be determined.

In accordance with this proposition the ironwork of the roof over the museum
was erected early in the spring, and covered with slate, fastened to the iron purlines
with wire and plastered inside with wall plaster. The iron gutters, as well as the
roof, were found perfectly secure from leakage during the hardest summer rains.
The severe test of ice and snow during the present winter hassshown the necessity
for additions in the arrangements for conducting the water from the roof. Plans for
this purpose are now under discussion with the architect for persevering in the orig-
inal plan, or adopting some additional security that the late severe season has indi-
‘ated to be advisable.

The adaptation of new to old work in restoring the building from the destructive
effects of the fire by substituting incombustible materials for wooden partitions,
floors, and roofs, has been attended, as was foreseen, with much labor and expense,
as well as making additional means indispensable for rendering the roof surfaces,
valleys, and gutters water-tight in winter, when covered with snow and occasionally
ice, as well as the summer rains. Like the public buildings generally in this city
(and we may say elsewhere) where battlements extend above the eaves, with gutters
behind them upon the roof, or resting upon the walls, much inconvenience, and at
times damage, arises from leaks the result of such a system. It is experienced in
the Smithsonian building in consequence of the stone battlements capping all its
exterior walls. The present architect’s original design, approved by the committee,
is set forth in his report of the operations of the year annexed hereto. Neither
time nor the funds of the Institution would permit his carrying this part of his plan
into operation; and until it is done, together with some additions that the late
inclement season has pointed out as advisable and necessary, the building is not
secure, nor the property within it, from dampness and moisture.

The introduction of the proposed warming apparatus for all the apartments is
the next most essential particular to be undertaken, to be commenced whenever the
funds of the Institution will justify.

The security of the several apartments and contents are ina great measure depend-
ent upon such an apparatus as a substitute for the stoves temporarily in use, and for
which no permanent smoke flues or other arrangements were provided.

All the rooms in the north tower, forming three suites of three in each, with two
rooms on the entrance floor, one for the janitor and the other for a reception room
for visitors, have been completed and are now used and occupied as offices for con-
ducting the operations of the Institution. The several apartments in this north
tower above these oflices have also been completed. The rooms and apartments in
the south tower have also been finished and are now occupied. The lower one, or
that on the first floor, forms a part of the general museum and is now devoted to the
reception of the larger and most weighty articles of ethnology, such as the stone
images from Central America and the stone sarcophagus from Syria.
218 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The apartments on the next story have been fitted up with shelves, bins, and other
fixtures for the transaction of the business of the literary and scientific exchanges,
packing and distributing the same.

The apartments next above have been finished for the meetings and convenience
of the Board of Regents, and those on the three remaining floors have also been fin-
ished and appropriated to storage and such other purposes as may become necessary.
In this tower are also provided an elevator with convenient mechanical power for
removing books, specimens, etc., to and from the basement and four stories aboye
it, CUGS a

To increase the accommodation two additional floors have been added to the
original subdivision of the stories of the north and south towers. To furnish light to
the new rooms in the south tower, circular windows have been opened through the
walls, without interfering with the original architectural effect of the exterior, thus
furnishing sufficient light for the purpose for which these apartments are intended.

The cost of the reconstruction during 1865, 1866, and 1867 amounted
to $119,528.01, all of which was paid from Smithsonian funds, except
the sum of $8,883.69 taken from the Congressional appropriation for
the preservation of the Government collections.

At the Regents’ meeting of January 27, 1868, it was resolved that
the great, hall of the second story of the building and such other rooms
as are not required for the regular operations of the Institution be
devoted to the preservation of the scientific collections. It should be
explained in this connection that before this time the library of the
Institution had been transferred to the Library of Congress, thus
increasing the amount of space available for museum purposes.

A resolution was also adopted at the same meeting that a committee
be appointed to report to the Regents at their next meeting what
amount of appropriation should be asked of Congress for the care of
the Museum and for fitting up the great hall for the safe-keeping and
exhibition of specimens. On May 1, 1868, as a result of this action
the following memorial was presented to Congress:

To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled:

In behalf of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, the undersigned
beg leave respectfully to submit to your honorable body the following statement,
and to solicit such action in regard to it as may be deemed just and proper:

* * * * * * *

It is true that Congress, at the time the specimens were transferred to the Institu-
tion, granted an appropriation of $4,000 for their care and preservation, that being
the equivalent of the estimated cost of the maintenance of these collections in the
Patent Office, where they had previously been exhibited. But this sum, from the
rise in prices and the expansion of the museum by the specimens obtained from
about fifty exploring expeditions ordered by Congress, scarcely more than defrays
at the present time one-third of the annual expense. In this estimate no account is
taken of the rent of the part of the building devoted to the museum of the Govyern-
ment, which at a moderate estimate would be $20,000 per annum.

Besides the large expenditure which has already been made on the building, at
least $50,000 more will be required to finish the large hall in the second story,
necessary for the full display of the specimens of the Government. But the Regents
do not think it judicious further to embarrass the active operations for several years
to come by devoting a large part of the income to this object, and have therefore

concluded to allow this room to remain unfinished until other means are provided
for completing it.

It is not by its castellated building nor the exhibition of the museum of the Goy-
ernment that the Institution has achieved its present reputation, nor by the collec-
tion and display of material objects of any kind that it has vindicated the intelligence
and good faith of the Government in the administration of the trust. It is by its
explorations, its researches, its publications, its distribution of specimens, and its
exchanges, constituting it an active, living organization, that it has rendered itself
favorably known in every part of the civilized world, has made contributions to
almost every branch of science, and brought more than ever before into intimate
and friendly relations the Old and New, Worlds.

* * * * * * *

The Board of Regents are confident that upon a full consideration of the case, your
honorable body will grant an adequate support for the collections of the Goyern-
ment, and also an appropriation for finishing the repairs of the building.

* x * x x * *

In conclusion, your memorialists beg leave to represent on behalf of the Board of
Regents that the usual annual appropriation of $4,000 is wholly inadequate to the
cost of preparing, preserving, and exhibiting the specimens, the actual expenditure
for that purpose in 1867 having been over $12,000; and they take the liberty of
respectfully urging on your honorable body the expediency of increasing it to
$10,000, and that a further sum of $25,000 be appropriated at this session of Congress
toward the completion of the hall required for the Government collections.

And your memorialists will ever pray, etc.

S. P. Cass,
Chancellor Smithsonian Institution.

JosEPH Henry,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

In his report for the same and the succeeding year, Secretary
Henry explained that the only exhibition rooms to which the general
public had had admission since the fire were the large hall on the first
floor of the main building and the adjoining apartment in the south
tower. This large hall, containing rich collections in ornithology and
ethnology, presented to the eye a succession of large pillars, which
obstructed the view of the cases. In fitting up the room of corre-
sponding dimensions in the second story, an opportunity would be
afforded of adopting arrangements far better suited for a comprehen-
sive display of the vast number of objects with which in time it would
be furnished, as it was intended that the ceiling of this hall should be
attached to the long iron girders which span the space from wall to
wall, thus obviating the necessity for introducing columns. In addi-
tion to the above the west connecting range was provided in 1868 with
cases for ethnological specimens and opened to the pub.ie in 1869.
The west wing was at this time temporarily appropriated to the alco-
holic specimens and miscellaneous purposes.

During each of the years 1870 and 1871, Congress appropriated
$10,000 for the fitting up of the large second-story room and other
work of reconstruction. Those sums, together with about $9,000 from
220 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

the income of the Smithsonian fund, $29,000 in all, were expended for
that purpose in the latter year.

A readjustment of quarters in the Smithsonian building was
announced by Secretary Henry in his report for 1871, as follows:

Arrangements haye been made for appropriating the east wing and range to the
business which may be considered as belonging exclusively to the essential objects
of the Institution, and deyoting the main building, west wing, and towers to the
Museum. For this purpose the large room on the first floor of the east wing, which
was formerly used as a museum laboratory and storeroom, has been fitted up with
bins and conyeniences for assorting and packmg the literary and scientific exchanges
to be sent to foreign countries. Preparation has also been made for removing the
chemical laboratory from the first floor of the east range to the space immediately
below it in the basement, and for applying the whole of the first floor of this part
of the building to the business offices of the Secretary and his assistants in the line
of what are called the ‘‘active operations.”’

For the special accommodation of the Museum the large room in the west wing,
formerly occupied by the library, has been prepared for the reception of cases for
mineralogical and geological specimens, while the great hall, 200 feet by 50, in the
second story of the main building, has been completed and is now ready to receive
the cases for the anthropological and other specimens.

Estimates are now before Congress for fitting up these rooms with cases for the
reception and display of the Government collections, and it is hoped that in the
next report we shall be able to chronicle the commencement, if not the completion,
of the work.

The changes consequent upon the extension of the Museum mentioned made a
rearrangement necessary of the greater part of the basement, so as to obtain addi-
tional security against fire and greater convenience for the storage of fuel, packing
boxes, and specimens. A floor was laid through the basement, and new passage-
ways opened, furnishing better access from one extreme of the building to the other.
In introducing the fireproof floor into the west wing, advantage was taken of the
opportunity to increase the height of the room below it, and to convert it and the
adjoining rooms in the west range into laboratories and storerooms for natural
history.

Furthermore, for better security, the fireproofing of the floors of the four towers
on the corners of the main building has been commenced. The rooms in the towers
furnish studies and dormitories for the investigators in the line of natural history
who resort to the Institution, especially during the winter, to enjoy the use of the
library and the collections for special researches.

% * % x x x *

For defraying the expenses of the care and exhibition of the National Museum,
Congress has annually, for the last two years, appropriated $10,000. Although this
appropriation was more than double that of previous years, still it fell short of the
actual expenditure. The amount of items chargeable to the Museum during the past
year, independent of the rent which might have been charged for the rooms occu-
pied, or for repairs of the building, was a little more than $13,000. Deducting from
this sum the $10,000 appropriated by Congress, there remains $3,000, which was paid
from the income of the Smithson fund.

A statement of this deficiency has been presented to Congress, and we trust that
the sum of $15,000 will be appropriated for the same purpose for the ensuing fiscal
year.

the west wing and connecting range to the same purpose, the space allotted to the

Museum in the Smithson building has been increased to about threefold. It is pro-
posed, as was stated in the last report, to devote the room in the west wing to speci-
mens of geology and mineralogy, and the large room in the second story to specimens
of archzeology and paleontology. As preparatory to the fitting up of these rooms,
a series of designs has been prepared at the expense of the Institution by B. Water-
house Hawkins, the well-known restorer of the ancient animals which illustrate the
paleontology of the Sydenham Palace, near London.

ALTERATIONS AND REPAIRS SUBSEQUENT TO 1877.

On December 10, 1877, the President of the United States trans-
mitted to Congress the report of a commission, consisting of Lieut.
Col. Thomas L. Casey, U.S. Army, the Supervising Architect of the
Treasury, and the Architect of the Capitol, appointed by him on
September 27, 1877, to examine the several public buildings in this
city and determine the nature and extent of their security against
conflagrations and the measures to be taken to guard the buildings
and their contents from destruction or damage by fire. This com-
mission recommended in respect to the Smithsonian building that—

All the combustible materials used in the construction of the museum portion of
the building should be removed and the parts renewed of fireproof construction,
and the openings connecting with other parts of the building should be supplied
with fireproof doors.

On the same date the Secretary of the Interior submitted to Con-
gress an estimate ‘‘to provide additional security against fire in the
Smithsonian building for the Government collections, $3,000,” and on
March 27, 1878, Secretary Henry wrote as follows to Senator A. A.
Sargent:

I have the honor to inform you that shortly after the fire at the Patent Office the
Smithsonian building was visited by the Government committee of inspection and
suggestions made by them as to the fireproofing of the portion of the edifice devoted
to the collections of the National Museum. These suggestions were at once acted
upon, at an expense of $2,803.29, as per detailed memorandum herewith, and I
write to beg that you will kindly consider the propriety of having an item intro-
duced into the deficiency bill whereby the Smithson fund may be reimbursed for this
outlay.

The action taken was described as follows:

Attention having been specially called to the condition of the public buildings in
this city on account of the destruction by fire of part of the Patent Office, it was
deemed advisable to give additional security to the valuable collections deposited in
the Smithsonian edifice. The main building, which contains the National Museum,
is entirely fireproof, but the connecting ranges and the two wings are not so. It
was therefore highly desirable that the main building should be entirely isolated
from the ranges and wings. For this purpose the large windows facing the wings
were bricked up and all the doorways leading from the museum into the ranges
either bricked up or fitted with iron instead of wooden doors. The carpenter’s and
machinist’s shops were removed to the main basement and inclosed in brick walls.
The storage rooms were made fireproof by replacing wooden partitions and floors
by those of brick. In the high central tower brick partitions have been constructed
on the stairways, to prevent the passage of fire from one story to another.
222 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Secretary Baird also refers to this subject as follows in his report
for 1880:

The Smithsonian building was one of those carefully examined by the commis-
sion, and it was recommended that iron doors should be placed in the passageways
between certain rooms. An appropriation of $3,000 was subsequently @ made by
Congress for this purpose; and a contract for its execution was accordingly entered
into with Mr. George L. Damon, of Boston. After considerable delay in the per-
formance of this contract, the doors were delivered and put in place by Mr. Damon,
to the entire satisfaction of the executive committee. This arrangement has greatly
promoted the safety of the building and its contents from the risk of the spreading of
any fires which might accidentally occur within its walls. A few additional changes
are still desirable to give still further security to the public property placed in the
charge of the Institution.

In his report for 1879 Secretary Baird writes that during the year
other alterations had been made in order to increase the efficiency of
the building and reduce the expense of superintendence and mainte-
nance. The document room had been enlarged and refitted. The east-
ern wing, formerly used by Secretary Henry as a residence, had been
converted into a series of offices. Eleven large fireproof doors had
been placed in the building to isolate the different wings and floors.
The laboratory had been rearranged and many other improvements
made, and it was believed that the building was then in a condition of
thorough efficiency and adaptation to its scientific purposes.

In each succeeding report mention is made of necessary repairs and
alterations of greater or less extent, at the cost of the Smithsonian
fund, but the annual expenditure for these purposes was generally
small. Secretary Baird reported in 1881 that—

At no distant time some expensive work of renovation will be required upon the
ceiling of the great hall in the second story of the main building, as in some places
the plaster appears in danger of falling off and injuring the cases and specimens on
exhibition below.

In 1882 somewhat extensive changes were made at the west end of
the building. The basement under the west wing, which had pre-
viously been occupied indiscriminately for the preservation and elabo-
ration of the collection of birds and fishes, was subdivided, and each
subject contined strictly to its own section.

The western corridor was also at this time fitted up as an exhibition
hall for fishes.

At the meeting of the Board of Regents held January 18, 1882,
Secretary Baird called attention to the combustible and insecure con-
dition of the eastern portion of the Smithsonian building, and pre-
sented plans, prepared at his request. by the architects, Messrs. Cluss
& Schulze, which, without materially changing the architecture of
the building, would provide largely increased accommodations for

@Sundry civil act for 1880.

offices and workrooms, the storage of publications, the exchange
system, ete.

The Board unanimously adopted a resolution, instructing the Secre-
tary and executive committee to present the subject to Congress and
request an appropriation for the purpose. The Secretary, in accord-
ance with this instruction, sent the following letter on the 13th of
March to the Speaker of the House of Representatives:

Hon. J. W. Kerrrr,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Sir: By instruction of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, I have
the honor to transmit to Congress the following resolution, adopted at the last meet-
ing of the Board, January 18, 1882, and, in doing so, beg that it be referred to the
appropriate committee of the House of Representatives and receive that attention
which the urgency of the case requires:

“Resolved, That the Secretary and executive committee present a memorial to
Congress showing the importance and necessity of rendering the east wing of the
Smithsonian building fireproof, requesting an appropriation therefor, and, if the
means are furnished, to proceed with the work.”’

It will be remembered that in January, 1865, a fire occurred in the Smithsonian
building, which destroyed a large portion of the main edifice, with its adjacent
towers, and a very large amount of valuable public and private property.

The main building was restored with fireproof materials, but the east wing, composed
entirely of wood and plaster, and which had escaped injury, remains in its previous
dangerous condition. Originally a lecture room, it was fitted up many years ago
with apartments for the residence of the late Secretary and his family. This applica-
tion of the wing, however, was discontinued after Professor Henry’s death; but the
rooms thus set apart are entirely unsuited to the operations of the establishment,
and, while in every way objectionable, the timbers have decayed and no arrange-
ments are provided for proper lighting, heating, and ventilation.

The main building and western extension are occupied by the collections of the
Government; the east wing embraces the offices of the Secretary, chief clerk, corre-
sponding clerk, and registrar, and also accommodations for the extensive operations
of the department of international exchanges, the benefits of which accrue not only
principally to the Library of Congress, but to all the public libraries and scientific
societies throughout the United States. The rooms are filled with the archives, files
of correspondence, original scientific manuscripts, vouchers, the stock of Government
and Smithsonian publications for distribution at home and abroad, ete., and their
destruction by fire, to which they are constantly exposed, would be greatly detri-
mental to the interests of the Government and the general public.

In addition to this, an extensive fire in the east wing would endanger and possibly
destroy the main portion of the Smithsonian building, the upper and lower halls of
which contain rare specimens belonging to the Government, and most of which
could not be replaced. :

Congress has recognized the importance and propriety of gradually reconstructing
the interior of the Smithsonian building, in fireproof materials, by making appro-
priations for the purpose at various times between 1870 and 1875; and the last Con-
gress, in 1879, appropriated $3,000 ‘‘for providing additional security against fire in
the Smithsonian building.”’

It is now proposed to remodel the interior of the east wing, so that without dis-
turbing its present architectural style, the internal capacity will be doubled by a new
arrangement of floors, partitions, and roofs, and all the rooms be adapted to the efli-

cient prosecution of the work of the Institution and the various interests intrusted
to its management by Congress.

Inclosed I beg to send a copy of the report of the board of fire inspectors (appointed
by the District Commissioners ) upon the condition of the Smithsonian building. I
have the honor to ask, in the name and on behalf of the Board of Regents that the
following appropriation be made at the present session of Congress, viz, ‘‘ For con-
tinuing and completing the fireproofing of the Smithsonian Institution, $50,000.”

Iam, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
Srencer F. Barry, Secretary.

GENTLEMEN: The commission to inspect buildings in the District beg leave to sub-
mit herewith report No. 5.

By invitation of Professor Baird, the east wing and connecting corridor to the main
building of the Smithsonian Institution was visited and inspected. In this portion
of the building are all the records and valuable documents belonging to the Institu-
tion. The interior is entirely of wood and illy arranged, making it especially unsafe
and liable to accident from fire, thus endangering the entire building. As a matter
of safety, this wing and corrider should be completely cleared out and rebuilt of fire-
proof material and furnished with improved modes of communication and egress.

Official extract furnished Prof. 8. F. Baird.

WiLiiaM TINDALL,
Secretary Commissioners District of Columbia.

The above memorial received favorable consideration by the Forty-
seventh Congress, resulting in the passage of the following item in the
sundry civil act for 1884:

For completing the reconstruction, in a fireproof manner, of the interior of the
eastern portion of the Smithsonian Institution, $50,000. (Stat. XXII, 628.)

The preparation of plans, the details of construction, etc., were
placed in charge of Messrs. Cluss & Schulze, architects. Proposals
were asked and the bids opened on April 26, 1883. The removal of
the contents of the east wing and corridor was soon effected, the offices
of clerks and others were transferred to the large adjacent exhibition
hall, and accommodations for storage were provided by the erection of
a temporary shed on the south side of the Smithsonian building.

In 1883 Secretary Baird reported that—

The appropriation was found sufficient to secure the fireproofing of the building,
but a number of other desirable objects remain to be secured, such as a heating
apparatus, a passenger elevator, a freight lift; the introduction of speaking tubes,
electric bells, telephones, a concrete floor in the basement, an underground communi-
cation between the Smithsonian and the new Museum buildings, ete., for which an
additional appropriation of $15,000 has been asked.

Two subsequent appropriations were granted by Congress with
reference to these changes, as follows:

For finishing, heating, gas fitting, plumbing, and completely furnishing the eastern
portion of the Smithsonian Institution, and for finishing the fourth and fifth stories,
including liabilities already incurred, $15,000. (Sundry ciyil act for 1885. )

Report of U. S. National Museum, 1903,—Rathbun. PLATE 8.

WEST RANGE, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BUILDING. EXHIBITION OF INSECTS.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 225

For finishing and completing the furnishing of the eastern portion of the Smithso-
nian Institution building, $5,600. (Sundry civil act for 1886. )

In his report for 1884 Secretary Baird announced the expenditure
of the appropriation of $15,000 in fitting up the two upper stories of
the building, which had been necessarily left unfinished for lack of
funds. This included the introduction of iron furring and iron lathing
for the ceilings immediately under the roof, and the fitting up of many
of the rooms for their special requirements. The rooms in the recon-
structed portion were then all occupied for the general purposes of
the Institution, notably the departments of administration, of interna-
tional and miscellaneous exchanges, of the reference library, of trans-
portation, and of publication, the chemical laboratory, ete.

In transferring the offices back to the east end considerable changes
were made in the lower hall of the main building, including the
removal of all exhibition cases in the galleries, which have since been
used exclusively for laboratory and storage purposes by several
departments of zoology. Telephones, speaking tubes, an accurate
time service, and other minor conveniences were also introduced at the
eastern end.

The report of the Secretary for 1885 notes the completion of the
alterations in the east wing and corridor in a thoroughly fireproof
manner, with twice the original number of available oftice rooms, and
with every facility for doing the work mentioned in the best possible
manner. It also calls attention to the unsightly and dilapidated con-
dition of the remainder of the building, used by the Museum, which
will soon require extensive repairs.

In accordance with estimates submitted, the sundry civil act for
1888 provided ‘for urgent and necessary repairs to central and west-
ern portions of the Smithsonian Institution building, $15,000.” Ina
letter to the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations,
dated December 11, 1886, and in his annual report for 1887, Secretary
Baird explained the reasons for the proposed changes, stating that
the floors, ceilings, and roof of the west corridor were the same as in
the original construction and not fireproof, being in fact very com-
bustible. Nearly all of the large alcoholic collections of the National
Museum and the Fish Commission were in or adjacent to this part of
the building, so that should a fire break out it would result not only in
serious damage to the building, but also in the entire destruction of
extensive and valuable portions of the national collections. He also
called attention to the fact that, though the Smithsonian building was
constructed at the expense of the Smithsonian fund, it had since 1858
been almost wholly given over to the purposes of the National
Museum.

NAT Mus 1903 15

226 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The fireproofing was intrusted to Messrs. Cluss & Schulze, archi-
tects, from whose report the following account of the work is taken.

The reconstruction extended over the curtain between the main building and the
west wing, a building of 60 feet in length and 54 feet in width, with an adjoining
turret containing stairs. It contains a basement where alcoholic specimens are
kept.

The main story is mostly occupied by an exhibition hall, extending up into the
roof, with a clerestory. Along the north front was originally an open cloister,
which had been for many years temporarily fitted up by framework for offices.

Permanent provision was made for these purposes, and a mezzanine story formed
by the insertion of a fireproof upper floor.

Besides the old, rotten, combustible floors and roofs, a complicated system of
decorative hollow columns and vaults, framed of wooden scantlings, boards, and
lathed plastering, had to be carefully removed, so as not to injure the outside walls,
consisting of a thin cut-stone facing, backed by ordinary rubblework.

In the reconstruction the Romanesque general character of the building was pre-
served with the greatest simplicity compatible with the surroundings, and also made
a necessity by the limited appropriation in conjunction with the increased cost of
decorations in the fireproof materials.

The fact that the west wing and the central part of the Smithsonian
building had never been made entirely fireproof was communicated to
the Regents by Secretary Langley in his report for 1888, in which
attention was also called to the proximity of much inflammable mate-
rial. He likewise explained that for certain reasons the fireproofing
of the west wing was the more urgent. References to this subject were
again made in the Secretary’s reports for 1889 and 1890, and the
importance was urged of gaining additional light in the center of the
main building by the construction of a skylight in the roof and a well-
hole through the second floor.

As these parts of the building were used for the National Museum,
an appropriation for the proposed changes was asked of Congress,
beginning in May, 1888, Senator Morrill, a Regent of the Institution,
pressing the matter with his customary energy. The first bills, relat-
ing mainly to the west wing, were passed by the Senate twice during
the Fiftieth Congress (ending March 4, 1889), but failed of action in
the House.

The question was again brought up in the Fifty-first Congress (1889-

1891), originating in the Senate, and was discussed in several forms.
The most comprehensive measure and the one carrying the largest
appropriation was Senate bill No. 2033, reported on January 27, 1890,
by Senator Morrill. Its wording was as follows:

That, for the purpose of fireproofing the roof of the main hall, and that of the
so-called chapel in the west wing of the Smithsonian building, and to put in a sky-
light and a wellhole to admit light into the central portion of the lower hall of said
building, and also to replace some woodwork of the towers, and other repairs, said
work to be done under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol with the approval
of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of $45,000 shall be, and
NATIONAL MUSEUM——BUILDINGS. 227

hereby is, appropriated out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appro-
priated.

On March 6, 1890, Secretary Langley addressed a letter to the
chairman of the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
on the subject of the above bill, in which he says that the $45,000 is
asked to complete the fireproofing and repair of a part of the build-
ing which for a long period has been almost entirely given over to
Government purposes rent free. Following are quotations from the
same letter:

The portions of the building which are not fireproof are—

The roof of the so-called ‘‘chapel’’ in the west wing, which contains collections
whose mere money value is estimated at over $250,000, but whose value to science is
inestimable. This is also the only portion of the building which is suitable to devote
to donations of art objects, which may be expected when the Government provides
a safe depository for them.

The ceiling and part of the roof of the main exhibition hall, now occupied by prob-
ably the most extensive and valuable archzeological collection in the United States,
is of combustible material and in urgent need of repairs, the ceiling threatening to
fall, in part, and crush the cases and their valuable contents and possibly endanger
the safety of visitors and employees. Both roofs are leaking, and these changes
involve the replastering and repainting of the walls.

The floor of the main hall, 200 by 50 feet, is worn out and needs renewal, and all
this implies special temporary provision for the collection.

The lower hall is now very dark, and in replacing the roof and ceiling of the
upper story it is desirable that a large skylight and wellhole be inserted, which
would greatly add to the comfort of visitors by increasing the light and providing
better ventilation.

The rooms occupied by the Bureau of International Exchanges are in less need of
repair, but some portion of the amount asked is intended to be devoted to the
extreme east wing, occupied by these offices.

In addition to what has been mentioned, there are wooden floors and other wood-
work in the towers which are a source of danger, and it is to be observed that, owing
to the crowded condition of the Museum, it has been necessary to erect a paint shop
filled with combustible material immediately against the south wall of the building
and close to the roof, whose dangerous condition has just been described. The
present state of things is one of continual menace.

The bill as finally enacted into law, as an item in the sundry civil
act for 1891, was as follows:

For fireproofing the so-called chapel of the west wing of the Smithsonian build-
ing, and for repairing the roof of the main building and the ceiling and plastering of
the main hall of the building, $25,000, said work to be done under the supervision
of the Architect of the Capitol, with the approval of the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, and no portion of the appropriation to be used for skylights in the roof
nor for wellhole in the floor of the main building, $25,000. (Stat. X XVI, 383. )

In his report for 1891 Secretary Langley announces gratifying
progress in the changes and repairs up to June 30, 1891, consisting in
the entire replacement of the roof of the west wing with a substantial
construction of iron and slate and the repairing of the roof and of
228 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

the ceiling and plastering of the upper hall of the main building. By
the close of the fiscal year 1892 this work was practically completed,
though with the expenditure of only a part of the appropriation, and
in his report for that year Secretary Langley states:

I would especially urge-that the balance of this appropriation, unexpended by
reason of a limiting clause introduced in the act, on account of which the money is
not available for certain repairs originally contemplated, should be now made ayail-
able by Congress for increasing the storage room in the east wing of the building,
and at the same time that certain rooms be fitted for the special needs of the Goy-
ernment Exchange Bureau, now occupying rooms in the main building urgently
needed for other purposes.

This request was granted by Congress in the sundry civil act for
1894, as follows:

For completing the repairs upon the Smithsonian building, and for such other
work as is needed to protect the building from further deterioration and to place it
in proper sanitary condition, any unexpended balance remaining to the credit of the
appropriation for fireproofing, etc., shall be available for the purposes above stated;
this work to be done under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol and in accord-
ance with the approval of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. (Stat.
XX VII, 582.)

The use made of the unexpended balance above referred to is thus
described in the report of the Secretary for 1893:

A restrictive clause contained in the appropriation of August 30, 1890, for repairs
to the Smithsonian building was removed by a clause in the sundry civil act for the
year ending June 30, 1894, so that a portion of the amount unexpended became ayail-
able for making necessary repairs to the roof of the eastern wing and improving the
sanitary condition of the building, as well as for increasing the space ayailable for
storing documents and handling the Government exchanges. The plumbing in the
eastern part of the building has been thoroughly overhauled and a suite of dark and
damp rooms in the basement, on the south side, has been transformed into well-
lighted and comfortable offices, thus freeing several rooms upon the first floor, needed
for other purposes, and making it possible to handle more expeditiously the great
number of books passing through the exchange office, though even with these new
rooms additional storeroom for the Government exchanges will be called for at no
distant day.

Other small changes at the east end of the building, made mainly
at the expense of the Smithsonian fund, are described as follows in the
reports for 1894 and 1895:

The narrow windows and the small diamond panes of glass admit so little light
that in winter days some of the rooms where clerical work is carried on need to be
artificially lighted, and in all cases the occupants lose the advantage of what ought
to be abundant light, considering their open surroundings in the middle of a park.
I think it well to state that while I should have made many more changes in the
interest of the comfort and health of the clerical occupants of the building if I had
had the means to do so, I have never felt at liberty to alter the external appearance
of the building when alteration could possibly be avoided, and I have therefore never
authorized the enlargement of any of the apertures in the stone work or made any
changes of this kind which could be understood as modifying the structural features
(except in improving the sanitary conditions of the basement), and when any change

is mentioned here it will always be understood that it is essentially the work of the
carpenter in providing for larger inside frames and larger lights in the sashes and in
like alterations.

Thus, in the east wing of the building, in the fourth story, a room for containing
the archives of the Institution has been provided, which is well lighted by one of
the few large windows the building possesses and which has been fitted for more
conyenient reference to the records of the Institution. The second floor has been
made brighter by repainting and by some additional floor lights in the third floor,
and the windows in the room especially set apart for the safe-keeping of the engray-
ings and books of art belonging to the Institution have been thus enlarged, while
some of the rooms on the second floor have been improved by slight alterations in
the window frames. On the first floor additional quarters were provided for the
library in the rooms which were vacated by the transfer of the exchange department
to the lower floor.

In continuing much-needed improvements in the east wing of the Smithsonian
building, especially with a view to better light and ventilation, the lighting of the
rooms on the first floor occupied by the library has been greatly improved by
enlarging the window frames and replacing the small diamond panes by single
sheets of glass. Similar changes have been made in the Secretary’s office, on the
second floor, as well as in some of the rooms on the third and fourth floors. Several
rooms on the fourth floor, heretofore of no use except for storage, have been made
habitable and have proved useful for various needed purposes.

The sanitary condition of the building has been improved by the removal of cer-
tain objectionable features and by the installation of a comprehensive system of ven-
tilation by which pure air at an equable temperature is assured in most of the office
rooms. Work upon this was well advanced at the close of the year.

Another great improvement added during the year is the introduction of electric
lights in all the offices of the east wing, the electric power being supplied by a spe-
cial plant, which, with the ventilating apparatus, has been placed in the basement
of the south tower, where considerable changes were made for their accommodation.

Since the above dates the only alterations which need be mentioned
in this connection have been the replacement of the wooden floor in
the lower main exhibition hall with a terrazzo pavement, the fitting
up of the children’s room on the main floor of the south tower, the
improvement of the conditions on all the other floors of the same
tower, and the construction of a tunnel between the Smithsonian and
Museum buildings, which, while intended primarily for the heating
pipes, electric wires, etc., has been made sufliciently large to serve as
a general passageway.

On the other hand, it is to be noted, with regret, that the upper
main exhibition hall, devoted to prehistoric archeology, had to be
closed in 1902 because of the loosening and fall of plaster over a large
part of the ceiling and walls. The room was at once recognized to
be unsafe for the admission of the public, and its appearance was
extremely unsightly. Provisional repairs, to the extent possible from
the regular appropriation, have recently been completed, and the hall
will soon again be made serviceable, but a considerable expenditure
would be required to place it in thoroughly good condition.
230 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.
SMITHSONIAN BUILDING.

DESCRIPTION.

Excterior.—The building erected for the Smithsonian Institution, in
accordance with the design prepared by Mr. James Renwick, jr.,
architect, of New York City, is in. the later Norman or, as it may with
more strict propriety be called, the Lombard style, as it prevailed in
Germany, Normandy, and southern Europe in the last half of the
twelfth century; the latest variety of the rounded style, as it is found
immediately anterior to the merging of that manner in the early
Gothic. In the general design and most of the details the architect
adhered to the period to which this style is referable. The general
feeling, however, which permeates the design, especially in the upper
towers, is that of a somewhat later era, when all lingering reminis-
cences of the post and lintel manner had been discarded and the ruling
principles of arch architecture were recognized and carried out. The
semicircular arch stilted is employed throughout in doors, windows,
and other openings. The windows are without elaborately traceried
heads. The buttresses are not a prominent feature and have no sur-
mounting pinnacles. The weather moldings consist of corbel courses,
with bold projection. The towers are of various shapes and sizes.
The main entrance on the north, sheltered by a carriage porch, is
between two towers of unequal height.

In his description of the plan in Hints on Public Architecture,
Doctor Owen states:

I am not acquainted with any actual example yet remaining from what has been
variously called the Lombard, the Norman, the Romanesque, and the Byzantine
school, with which the Smithsonian building will not favorably compare. In so far
as the architect has permitted himself to innovate upon ancient precedents from the
style in which he designed, he has done so, in my judgment, with discretion and
advantage. * * * IT esteem myself fortunate in being able in this book to refer
to an actual example, at our seat of government, the architect of which seems to me
to have struck into thé right road, to have made a step in advance, and to have
given us in his design not a little of what may be fitting and appropriate in any
manner (should the genius of our country hereafter work such out) that shall
deserve to be named as a national style of architecture for America.

The design as originally carried out consisted of a main central
building, two stories high, and of two lateral wings of a single story,
connected with the main building by intervening ranges, each of the
latter having a cloister, with open stone screen, on the north front.
The only important changes since made have been the reconstruction
of the east wing and range, which are now four and three stories
high, respectively, the closing in with stone of the western cloister
so as to adapt it to laboratory purposes, and the completion of the
fireproofing of the building.

OO Ee
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. Ara ae

The extreme length of the building from east to west is 447 feet.
The main structure is 205 feet long by 57 feet wide and 58 feet high
to the top of its corbel course, though, including the main north and
south towers and the carriage porch, it attains at the center an extreme
width of 160 feet. The east wing is 82 by 52 feet, the west wing,
including its projecting apse, 84 by 40 feet and 38 feet high, while
each of the connecting ranges is 60 by 49 feet.

The main building has in the center of its north front two towers,
of which the higher reaches an elevation of 145 feet. In the middle
of the south front is a single massive tower 37 feet square, including
buttresses, and 91 feet high. At its northeast corner stands a double
campanile, 17 féet square and 117 feet high to the top of its finial, at
its southwest corner is an octagonal tower finished with open work
above, and at its southeast and northwest corners are two smaller
towers. There is also a small tower at the northwest corner of the
west wing.

The location of the building is the center of the original Smith-
sonian reservation, or the southern and higher part of the so-called
Smithsonian Park, about 20 feet above the average level of Pennsyl-
vania avenue. The material of which the building is constructed is a
fine grade of freestone, of the lilac-gray variety, obtained from quar-
ries in the new red sandstone near the mouth of Seneca Creek, a trib-
utary of the Potomac River, about 23 miles above Washington. The
faces of the building are finished in ashlar, laid in courses from 10 to
15 inches high.

At the present time it would not be considered appropriate to design
a building of this character for museum purposes, because, while most
of the exhibition halls are more or less adapted to their requirements,
there is too much waste space, too many dark places, wholly inade-
quate accommodations for storage, and few rooms suitable for labora-
tories, the latter also being mainly inconvenient of access. ‘The
windows were glazed in the beginning with small square pieces of
glass, set diamond shape in wooden frames, quite in keeping with the
style of architecture, though admitting less hght than larger panes.
This manner of glazing has been retained, except at the eastern end,
where, at the time of reconstruction, single lights were mainly
substituted.

The building was originally constructed in what seemed to be a
thoroughly substantial manner, but these qualities were mainly con-
fined to the outer walls and the floors. Subsequent reconstructions
have greatly tended to increase its stability, and the building through-
out is now practically fireproof. This has resulted from the introduc-
tion of fireproof construction and of iron doors, by means of which
any part of the building can readily be cut off from the remainder.
232 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The foundations are very substantial and the walls of the building
very thick, as would be necessary in a structure of this kind. The
roofs, except on the connecting ranges, are slated.

/nterior.—As first planned, the Museum was to occupy only the large
upper main hall in the Smithsonian building, the room now and for
many years past used for the exhibition collections of prehistoric
archeology. The corresponding hall on the main floor was to be
divided equally between the library and a large lecture room, while
the west hall and connecting range were specially constructed for the
gallery of art. The east hall and range, one story in height, contained
the smaller lecture room, laboratories, and rooms for apparatus.

During the progress of the work of -building and fitting up, how-
ever, all of these proposed arrangements were changed, either perma-
nently or temporarily, the assignments of space at the time of the fire
of 1865 having been as follows: The east wing was separated into two
stories, the upper of which was divided into a suite of rooms for the
accommodation of the Secretary and his family. The lower story con-
sisted principally of a single large room, appropriated to the storage
of publications and their reception and distribution in connection with
the system of exchanges. The upper story of the eastern connecting
range contained a number of small apartments devoted to the opera-
tions in natural history, and the lower story was fitted up as a work-
ing laboratory.

The upper story of the main building was divided into a lecture
room, capable of holding 2,000 persons, and two additional rooms,
at the ends, 50 feet square, one of which contained a museum of appa-
‘atus and the other a gallery of art. Both were occasionally used as
minor lecture rooms and for the meetings of scientific, educational,
and industrial associations. In 1868, after the rebuilding made neces-
sary by the fire, this entire story was assigned to the Museum by ¢
resolution of the Board of Regents. The lower story of the main
building, consisting of one large hall, was unoccupied at first, but as
the means for furnishing were provided it was utilized for the exhi-
bition of natural history and other collections, the specimens from the
Patent Office having been mainly transferred to these quarters in 1858.

The west wing was occupied by the library until its transfer to the
Library of Congress in 1866, while the west range was used as a read-
ing room. The tower rooms were utilized for various purposes, one
large room in the south tower being assigned to the meetings of the
Establishment and the Board of Regents, and three rooms in the north
tower to the offices of the Secretary.

Since the fire of 1865 there have been even greater changes, as
detailed in the foregoing historical account. By 1871 the adminis-
trative offices had become practically segregated in the east wing and
range, commonly designated together as the ‘‘east end,” which was

fireproofed and considerably enlarged at the time of its rebuilding in
1884. In 1871 nearly all the remainder of the building was given
over to the purposes of the National Museum.

At the east end are now the offices of the Secretary and of the
parent institution, as well as those for the general administration
of the Government branches under the direction of the Institution,
the offices of the exchange service and of the international catalogue
of scientific literature, and rooms for that part of the Smithsonian
library which is retained at the Institution. In this part of the build-
ing are also several rooms used conjointly with the Museum, such as
the disbursing office, the quarters of the registrar and the shipping
clerk, and apartments for the storage and distribution of documents.

Immediately inside the principal or northern entrance of the main
building is an octagonal vestibule between 17 and 18 feet across, at
each side of which is a small room about 15 feet square occupied by
the watch force and as an office of superintendence. Next follows
a long and high hall containing two iron stairways leading to the
upper stories. The main lower hall, which measures about 200 feet
long by 50 feet wide and 23 feet 8 inches high, might be expected to
present exceptional advantages for the exhibition of collections, yet it
has several very marked defects. The large windows (14 feet 10
inches high by 4 feet 5 inches wide), reaching from about 4 feet 5
inches above the floor to within the same distance of the paneled ceil-
ing, afford abundant light at the ends, but in the center of the room
on both the north and south sides there is a long blank wall necessi-
tating artificial lighting over a considerable space. Furthermore, the
ceiling of the room is supported by two rows of very heavy orna-
mental columns (3 feet 3 inches wide, 8 feet 9 inches apart, and about
14 feet distant from the walls) which unite in a series of arches above.
Between these columns and the outer walls, at a height of 8 feet from
the floor, are four galleries, 15 feet wide, which extend from the ends
of the hall to the central dark area, and both these columns and gal-
leries are further means of darkening the middle aisle of the room.

Except at the sides of the entrances, where they are arranged ina
large quadrangle illuminated by incandescent electric lamps, the cases
forming the main series in this hall extend from pillar to wall and
from the floor to the gallery so as to form successive bays or alcoves,
each lighted by a single window. In some of the alcoves there are
also small square cases, with groups of specimens, and all of the
above are used for the exhibition of birds. Extending through the
central aisle is a series of unit cases, with sloping and upright tops,
for the display and storage of mollusks.

A passageway from the middle of the hall leads to a small room,
about 25 by 23 feet, forming the main floor of the south tower, the
exterior entrance to which has been closed. This room has been
234 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

transformed into the so-called children’s room, with a mosaic floor,
the walls painted in several tints of green, and the ceiling covered
with an arbor and vine. Low, light-colored cases, almost wholly of
glass, contain a series of specimens, mostly animal, chosen to excite
the wonder of children, besides which there are several paintings
upon the walls and two aquaria with living fishes.

Adjoining the main hall on the west is the west range (60 by 387
feet), one story high, but surmounted by a clerestory. The side roofs
are supported by two rows of columns, similar to those in the main
hall but not so heavy, being 6 feet apart and about 8 feet 2 inches
from the side walls. The windows are confined to the south wall.
Upright cases form alcoves along the sides of the room, while flat-
topped table cases occupy the central aisle. This range has recently
been given over to the exhibition of insects. It previously contained the
fishes and was originally connected with the library as a reading room.

The western hall follows and has for a number of years been devoted
to the display of marine invertebrates exclusive of the mollusks, with
extensive provisions for the storage of specimens. It has the appear-
ance of a chapel, by which name it is often designated. It is rela-
tively very high, with an arched ceiling and skylight, and terminates
at the northern end in an apse. Its dimensions, not including the
apse, are: Length, about 66 feet; width, 35 feet; greatest height, 37
feet 8 inches. There are windows well up on the south and west sides
and lower ones in the apse, but none on the east. High up on the
south wall is a handsome rose window. This room, together with the
adjoining range, was planned to contain the gallery of art, but from
the time of its completion until 1866 it was occupied by the library.
Now upright cases of black walnut occupy the wall space on all sides,
except in the apse, which contains a synoptical collection displayed
in small cases. The body of the hall has three rows of flat-topped
and high, square cases, on unit bases fitted with storage drawers.
The small adjoining tower is also used for the storage of marine
invertebrates.

The old cloister to the north of the west range, originally open at
the front, was inclosed with wood at an early date; but when this part
of the building was fireproofed, the woodwork was replaced with stone.
The room thus gained is divided into two well-lighted apartments,
used as laboratories for fishes and marine invertebrates.

The second flo», as designated on the plans, contains the galleries
of the main lower hall already described. At the head of the first
flight of stairs from the main entrance are three small rooms used as
natural-history studies, and at a corresponding height in the south
tower is a room fitted up by the Smithsonian Institution for its collec-
tion of apparatus. There is also a low second-story room over the
western cloister, used for the storage cf fishes.

Properly speaking, the third floor, so named on the plans, is, for the
main part of the building, only the second floor. It consists of a
single large room of the same size as the lower main hall, being thus
about 200 feet long by 50 feet wide and 29 feet 3 inches high. For-
merly it contained the picture gallery, a lecture hall, and a museum
of apparatus, but soon after the restoration succeeding the fire of
1865 it was turned over to the department of prehistoric archeology,
which has occupied it ever since. It is one of the finest halls in the
possession of the Museum, but for a long time it has been in bad
condition, owing chiefly to the loosening and fall of plaster. The
extensive repairs made necessary on this account have, however,
recently been finished. As the ceiling is supported from the roof,
the hall contains no pillars, and there are no galleries, so that the
space is entirely clear; and while the windows bear the same relations
to the central space as in the lower hall, the light is more freely dis-
tributed. The cases are of several old patterns, not permitting of a
satisfactory installation, especially considering the height of the room,
which, with proper treatment, could be made exceedingly effective.
In the north tower on this level are three small rooms used as the
laboratories for prehistoric archeology, and in the south tower is the
Regents’ room.

The floor of the north towers and intervening space next above the
archeological workrooms comprises a suite of three similar rooms,
occupied as laboratories for conchology. Three succeeding floors in
the same towers, containing six rooms in all, are utilized as storerooms
for mollusks and other marine invertebrates. Above these in the
taller tower are still six stories, but their high position renders them
practically unserviceable. The three floors which succeed the Regents’
room in the south tower are all used for the storage of publications.

While the basement is of good height, only the eastern part is in
proper condition, the central and western parts requiring to be thor-
oughly renovated, including the building of broad areas along the
exterior to assist in the lighting and ventilation. The heating plant
is near the center of the basement, but now serves only in a supple-
mentary capacity. In the north tower are the toilet rooms. To the
eastward from there the basement is mainly used by the Smithsonian
Institution and the International Exchange Service; to the westward
all the available space is given over to Museum storage. There are
seven small rooms and one large room, one of the former being used
for supplies, while all the remainder are overtilled with specimens in
the several groups of birds, fishes, mollusks, and marine invertebrates.
With the exception of the birds, the specimens are mainly alcoholic.
These collections are very large and of great value, but they require
at least twice the present amount of space for their safe arrangement,
and the darkness and dampness of the rooms unfit them for purposes
of study.
236 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.
NATURAL-HISTORY WORKSHOP.

In order to provide more extensive and more suitable quarters for
the preparators and photographer of the Museum, with immediate
‘reference to preparations for the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibi-
tion, a small two-story brick building was constructed in 1875 on the
Mall, a short distance west of the southwestern corner of the Smith-
sonian building. It consists of a main structure, about 30 by 274
feet, and of two wings, each about 28 by 17 feet, on the east and west
sides. The latter have been used as a stable and a carriage house and
were somewhat enlarged in 1901 and 1902 at the expense of the
Smithsonian fund, their present dimensions being those given above.
The original Congressional appropriation for this building amounted to
$3,000, but, proving inadequate and in order to hasten its completion,
the Institution advanced an additional sum of $3,927.84, which was
refunded by Congress in 1877.

The upper part of the main building was fitted up as a photographic
laboratory, the remainder of the main building, with its basement
and the rooms over the carriage house, being assigned to the work
of taxidermy, preparation of skeletons, modeling, the painting of
models, etc. In the course of a few years the accommodations which
it furnished were greatly outgrown, and certain divisions of the work
were transferred elsewhere. At the present time only the upper story
is occupied for any of these purposes, and principally by the bird
taxidermists. In 1881 the department of photography was removed
to the Museum building, and the old rooms were allotted to the use of
the photographers of the U. S. Geological Survey and the Bureau

of American Ethnology, who remained there until 1884.
ARMORY BUILDING.

This building, assigned in 1577 to the purposes of the National
Museum and now occupied as the headquarters of the U.S. Fish
Commission, is located at the southern end of that part of the Mall
lying between Sixth and Seventh streets. It was erected under an
appropriation of $30,000, granted in the civil and diplomatic act for
1856, for the use of the local volunteers and militia and as a place of
deposit for the military trophies of the Revolutionary and other wars,
and for newly invented and model arms for the military service. It
is a rectangular brick structure, with many large windows, measuring
about 102 feet long, 58 feet wide, and 46 feet high to the gable. It
has four stories, including an attic, which afford a combined floor
space of over 20,000 square feet. The building remained dedicated to
its original uses until after the close of the civil war, when, the militia
of the District not being organized, it was left unoccupied.

The use of this building was granted to the Smithsonian Institution,
in order to provide for the temporary storage of the large collections
NATIONAL MUSEUM——BUILDINGS. 237

which were expected to be received from the Centennial Exhibition
at Philadelphia, by the following provision in the sundry civil act for

rec:

For repairing and fittingeup the so-called Armory building, on the Mall between
Sixth and Seventh streets, and to enable the Smithsonian Institution to store therein
and to take care of specimens of the extensive series of the ores of the precious
metals, marbles, building stones, coals, and numerous objects of natural history now
on exhibition in Philadelphia, including other objects of practical and economical
value presented by various foreign governments to the National Museum, $4,500:
Provided, That the said sum shall be expended under the direction of the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution.

The collections, when brought to Washington from Philadelphia and
stored in this building in their original packing cases, together with
other collections from national surveys, filled it completely from the
ground floor to the attic. The sundry civil act for 1878 provided for
the completion of the interior arrangements and for maintenance in
the following terms:

For fitting up the Armory building for storage of articles belonging to the United
States, including those transferred from the international exhibition and expense of
watching the same, $2,500. ;

For 1879 and 1880, the same sum was granted ‘‘for expense of
watching and storage of articles,” etc. An identical amount was
appropriated for 1881, in which year the National Museum building
was completed, and the following clause added: ‘‘and for transfer
to the new National Museum.”

Some of these collections, with others from the Geological Survey
and the Bureau of Ethnology, and several workshops were retained,
however, at the Armory building for a number of years longer, when
certain quarters, including the main floor, were appropriated to the
use of the U.S. Fish Commission, of which the Commissioner, Spencer
F. Baird, was also keeper of the Museum. The following was the
wording of the act for 1882:

For expense of watching, care, and storage of duplicate Government collections
and of property of the United States Fish Commission, $2,500.

The text of the sundry civil items for 1883, 1884, and 1885, was
identical, except for the insertion of the word ‘*‘ ground” in two
instances and its omission in the others, and was as follows:

For care of the Armory building (and grounds) and expense of watching, preser-
vation, and storage of the duplicate collections of the Government and of the prop-
erty of the United States Fish Commission contained therein, including salaries or
compensation of all necessary employees, $2,500.

In the corresponding bill for 1886, ‘‘the property of the. National
Museum” was substituted for ‘*the duplicate collections of the
Government.”

During the succeeding three years no appropriations were made
238 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

directly for the Armory building. It became more extensively used
by the Fish Commission, the Museum retaining only a few workshops
and some storage quarters on the third floor. The expenses of main-
tenance and repair were paid by the Commission. In 1888 the newly
appointed Fish Commissioner requested that the entire building be.
turned over to the Fish Commission for office and hatchery purposes.
Opposition arising, however, the matter was settled for the time by
the following item in the sundry civil act for 1889:

That the building known as the Armory building, Washington, D. C., shall be
occupied as at present, jointly by the United States Commission of Fish and Fish-
eries and the National Museum.

The act for 1890, however, which is as follows, extended the privi-
leges of the Fish Commission:

Fish Commission: For altering and fitting up the interior of the Armory building,
on the Mall, city of Washington, now occupied as a hatching station, for the accom-
modation of the offices of the United States Fish Commission, and for general repairs
to said building, including the heating apparatus, and for repairing and extending
the outbuildings, $7,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary, the same to be
immediately available and to be expended under the direction of the Architect of
the Capitol; and for the purpose above named the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution is hereby required to move from the second and third stories of this
building all properties, except such as are connected with the workshops hereinafter
named, under his control; and the workshops now in the second story of said build-
ing shall be transferred to and provided for in the third story thereof. And the
Architect of the Capitol is hereby directed to examine and make report to Congress
at its next regular session as to the practicability and cost of constructing a basement
story under the National Museum building.

In his report upon the National Museum for 1890, Doctor Goode
states that—

In the Armory building there are at the present time several hundreds of boxes
containing valuable material which has never been unpacked, since there is no
space available for the display of the specimens. Many of the boxes contain collec-
tions which were brought to the Museum through the medium of special acts of
Congress.

Realizing, however, the inconvenience to the Fish Commission of
retaining these undesirable features in the midst of the office quarters
then in course of construction, a compromise was effected whereby the
balance of the material in storage was transferred to a large adjacent
shed erected by the Commission and the workshops to a location near
the Museum. Some -parts of these sheds are still used for the same

purpose.
THE MUSEUM BUILDING.

HISTORICAL ACCOUNT.

At the beginning of 1877 the Board of Regents made its first request
to Congress for means to erect a museum building supplemental to
the Smithsonian building, which for over twenty years had housed the

collections of the Government in conformity with the act establishing
the Institution. By this time all of the available space in the Smith-
sonian building was overcrowded with specimens, and the need of
additional, spacious quarters had suddenly arisen, mainly through the
acquisition of exceedingly large collections of great value, donated to
the United States by foreign governments and other exhibitors at the
Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876. At their meeting of

» ber peor

January 24, 1877, the question was under discussion by the Regents,
when, on motion of Doctor Parker, the following preamble and reso-
lution were adopted, and the Secretary was instructed to transmit
them to Congress:

Whereas Congress, in the organization of the Smithsonian Institution, directed
that it should make provision on a liberal scale for a museum to contain all the
objects of natural history and of curious and foreign research, then belonging to or
hereafter to belong to the United States Government; and

Whereas, in accordance with this direction, the Institution has developed and for
many years principally supported this National Museum, the collection being
the property of the Government, while the building was erected for their accommo-
dation, at a cost of $500,000, out of the income of the Smithson fund; and

Whereas, on account of the appropriations of Congress for a national exhibit at the
Centennial, and the liberal donations which have been made by several States of
the Union, by individuals, and especially by foreign governments, the National
Museum has suddenly increased to fourfold its previous dimensions and far beyond
the capacity of the Smithsonian building to contain it: Therefore,

Resolved, That Congress be respectfully requested to provide accommodations for
these additional collections by the erection of a suitable building in connection with
the present Smithsonian edifice.

This resolution was presented to the Senate on January 26, 1877,
and to the House of Representatives on February 2 of the same year,
being referred in the former body to the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds and in the latter to the Committee on Appro-
priations.

Under date of February 5, 1877, the Regents also transmitted to
Congress a memorial on the same subject, “sist besides defining the
legal objects of the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution and the
origin and extent of its collections, contained the following paragraphs,
equally pertinent to the needs for added space:

3y an act bearing date July 31, 1876, additional duties were laid upon the Smith-
sonian Institution as custodian, and $4,500 were appropriated ‘for repairing and fit-
ting up the so-called Armory building, on the Mall between Sixth and Seventh
streets, and to enable the Smithsonian Institution to store therein and to take care
of specimens of the extensive series of the ores of the precious metals, marbles,
building stones, coals, and numerous objects of natural history now on exhibition in
Philadelphia, including other objects of practical and economical value presented by
various foreign governments to the National Museum.

As a fruit of this act of the General Government, the Smithsonian Institution finds
itself the custodian of enormous collections that had been displayed at the Centen-
nial Exposition and on the closing of that exhibition had been presented to the
United States. These donations are made by individuals among our own citizens,
240 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

by foreign exhibitors, and by several of the States of the Union, and there is scarcely
a power in the civilized world in any region of the globe which has not taken part in
these contributions, and some of them with the largest generosity. Men of science,
most competent to pass judgment, pronounce them to be of immense value and are
of opinion that, including the gifts from States of the Union and the exhibits of the
United States, they could not have been brought together by purchase for less than a

million of dollars.
* ¥ * * * *%

Their adequate exhibition requires an additional building which shall afford at
least four times the space furnished by the present edifice of the Institution.

The Government of the United States is now in possession of the materials of a
museum exhibiting the natural products of our own country, associated with those
of foreign nations, which would rival in magnitude, yalue, and interest the most
celebrated museums of the Old World.

The immediate practical question is, Shall these precious materials be for the most
part packed away in boxes, liable to injury and decay, or shall they be exhibited?

It was the act of Congress which ordered the acceptance in trust of these noble
gilts to the United States. The receiving of them implies that they will be taken
care of in a manner corresponding to the just expectations of those who gave them;
and one of the prevailing motives of the donors was that the productions of their
several lands might continue to be exhibited. The intrinsic value of the donations
is, moreover, enhanced by the circumstances under which they were made. They
came to us in the one hundredth year of our life as a nation, in token of the desire of
the governments of the world to manifest their interest in our destiny. This con-
sideration becomes the more pleasing when we bring to mind that these gifts have
been received not exclusively from the great nations of Europe from which we are
sprung, or from the empire and republics on our own continent beyond the line, but
that they come to us from the oldest abode of civilization on the Nile, from the time-
honored empires and kingdoms of the remotest eastern Asia, and from the principal
states which are rising into intellectual and industrial and political greatness in the
farthest isles and continent; from states which are younger than ourselves and bring
their contributions as a congratulatory offering to their elder brother.

We have deemed it our duty to lay these facts and reflections before both Houses
of Congress and to represent to them that if they, in their wisdom, think that the
unequaled accumulation of natural specimens and works interesting to science, the
evidence of the good will to us that exists among men, should be placed where it can
be seen and studied by the people of our own land and by travelers from abroad, it
will be necessary to make an appropriation for the immediate erection of a spacious
building. Careful inquiries have been instituted to ascertain the smallest sum which
would be adequate to that purpose, and the plan of a convenient structure has been
made by General Meigs, the Quartermaster-General, U.S. Army. We beg leave
further to represent that to accomplish the purpose there would be need of an appro-
priation of $250,000. This amount is required not as a first installment, to be fol-
lowed by others, but as sufficient entirely to complete the edifice.

Should this appropriation be made at an early day, the building could be ready for
the reception of articles before the next session of Congress.

This memorial was referred in both Houses to the Committees on
Public Buildings and Grounds and met with general favor. <A bill
meeting the requirements was passed by the Senate on February 22,
1877, but a corresponding bill offered in the House on March 2 was
defeated by objection, possibly because of the lateness of the session,
less than two days remaining before the close of Congress. The
debates were brief but interesting.

NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 241

Senator Morrill, on February 6, 1877, remarked:

As I have stated in years past, it has seemed to be a necessity that we should pro-
vide for a national museum. It has been the opinion of the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds on the part of the Senate, I believe unanimously, for some
years that we ought to take all of the squares next east of the public grounds,
throughout the length and breadth of the north and south range of one square, taking
one square in depth and the whole length, for the purpose of a national museum
and Congressional Library, and evidently this matter should be provided for at once.
* * * There are, as I am informed, at least fifty carloads of articles that have
been given to us by foreign governments. Thirty-two or thirty-three out of the forty
nationalities abroad have given us their entire exhibits at the Centennial Exhibition.
Their money value is scarcely computable, but if it were to be computed it exceeds
our own, as large as our exhibits were there and as creditable to the country. Our
own, I believe, in money value, have been computed at $400,000. These foreign
exhibits are computed, at least in money value, at the sum of $600,000, but in his-
torical and scientific interest they perhaps surpass anything that has been assembled
in any national museum on the globe.

Senator J. W. Stevenson, on the same day, made the following
statement:

It is known to the Senate that the Smithsonian Institution was represented at the
late Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. At the close of that exposition a number
of the foreign powers there represented and who contributed to that grand display,
at its close generously donated to the Smithsonian Institution most of their articles
and products there exhibited. * * * The motive which prompted these dona-
tions to the Smithsonian Institution was unquestionably one of amity and respect
entertained by the foreign powers donating them for the Government of the United
States. But unquestionably these donors expected that this Government would,
through the agency of the Smithsonian Institution, keep these articles thus donated
on public exhibition, and in this way the respective products of each country would
become known to the people of our entire country.

The articles donated are valuable, rare, varied, and occupy much space. * * *
The Smithsonian Institution has no building in which they can be either exhibited
or safely preserved. They must remain, therefore, in boxes, subject to injury and
to decay, unless Congress shall take some immediate action toward the erection of a
building in all respects suitable for their exhibition and preservation. The capacity
of such a building is estimated by competent architects to be four times as large as
the Smithsonian building. A plan of such a structure has been already drawn by
General Meigs. * * *

Professor Henry assures me that with the erection of the contemplated building
on the plan of General Meigs, with the articles now on exhibition in the Smith-
sonian Institution with those just donated, we shall have the nucleus of a national
museum which, in a few years, will equal any in the world.

In presenting the memorial to the House on February 7, 1877,
Representative Hiester Clymer said, among other things:

It may not be disputed that the acceptance of them [the collections from Phila-
delphia] by the Government imposes an obligation that they shall be preserved and
exhibited for the gratification and instruction of the people. Their preservation and
exhibition must be confided to the National Museum, of which, by law, the Regents
of the Smithsonian have the custody. They have presented for our consideration
the necessity for erecting a suitable building for the purposes I have indicated, giv-
ing an estimate of its probable cost.

242 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The bill which passed the Senate as an item in the sundry civil bill,
but failed of action in the House, in this the second session of the
Forty-fourth Congress was as follows:

For a fireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300 feet square, to be
erected under the direction and supervision of the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, in accordance with the plan of Maj. Gen. M. C. Meigs, now on file with
the Joint Committee of Public Buildings and Grounds, on the southwest corner of
the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of $250,000 is hereby appro-
priated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated; said building
to be placed west of the Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway -between it and
the latter of not less than 30 feet, with its north front ona line parallel with the
north face of the buildings of the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian
Institution; and all expenditures for the purposes herein mentioned, not including
anything for architectural plans, shall be audited by the proper officers of the
Treasury Department.

The necessity for a new Museum building was brought to the atten-
tion of the President of the United States through the following
communication, dated October 8, 1877:

Str: I have the honor, in behalf of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, to invite your attention to the propriety of recommending to Congress the
memorial of the Board of Regents (a copy of which is herewith inclosed), asking
that an appropriation be made for a building to accommodate the valuable collee-
tions presented to the United States through this Institution at the late international
exhibition in Philadelphia.

As explanatory of this request it may be proper to state that the Smithsonian
Institution was authorized by Congress to receive and take charge of these collections,
and that they were presented with the expectation on the part of the donors that
suitable provision would be made for their display at the seat of government. They
consist of full series of articles illustrative of the economic products, the natural his-
tory, and in many cases the manners, customs, and arts of the foreign countries
represented at the Centennial Exhibition, and are of great importance to the
advancement of science, education, and manufacture. Besides these are the objects
collected by the Smithsonian Institution and U. 8. Fish Commission of the animal,
mineral, and fishery resources of the United States, also of public interest.

These articles now constitute, by law, a part of the National Museum, which has
been placed by Congress in charge of the Smithsonian Institution. This Museum
has hitherto been accommodated in the building erected for the purpose at the
expense of the Smithson fund, in accordance with the direction of Congress. This
edifice, however, is filled to overflowing, while there are elsewhere, in storage, from
the donations previously mentioned, collections of greater magnitude than those in
the Smithsonian building.

It is evident that an appropriation for an additional building can not justly be
taken from the Smithson fund, and therefore the Board of Regents have made the
application mentioned in their memorial. This memorial was presented to Congress
at its last session, when the appropriation asked for was granted by the Senate unani-
mously, and when, in all probability, it would have been granted by the House
could the proposition have been brought to the consideration of that body.

I am, with sentiments of high esteem, your obedient servant,
JosEPpH Henry,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

ROTUNDA, NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 243

In his message to the Forty-fifth Congress, first session, December
3, 1877, the President recommended ‘‘ that an adequate appropriation
be made for the establishment and conduct of a national museum under
their [the Regents] supervision.”

Acting upon the basis of information supplied during the previous
session, the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives
(H. R. 2662) on January 21, 1878, by Senator Casey Young. It was
referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, which,
through Mr. Young, submitted a report (No. 244) upon the measure
on February 25, 1878. On March 6 following, the bill was again
brought up, referred to the Committee of the Whole and placed on
the Calendar, but no further action was taken. A similar bill (S. 1320)
was submitted in the Senate by Senator Justin S. Morrill on May 27,
1878, and referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds.

The report of the House committee (No. 244) briefly sets forth the
history and requirements of the Museum and the steps taken to secure
the valuable collections exhibited at Philadelphia, and closes as follows:

The collections in the Smithsonian building now open to the public oceupy about
30,000 square feet of floorspace. It is quite within bounds to estimate that the articles
stored away will require for their satisfactory exhibition between three and four
times that area, even allowing for a great reduction of the objects by the elimination
and distribution of the duplicate specimens. There is no provision whatever at
present for the display of these articles, and unless Congress furnishes the means
this magnificent property of the people will go to decay and destruction in the course
of time, the animal products being destroyed rapidly by insects and many objects of
a mineral or metallurgical character by rust.

As every day of delay in arranging and exhibiting this collection is accompanied
with the question of erecting a suitable building for its accommodation and has
occupied the attention of the Smithsonian Institution, a plan has been devised which,
“itis believed, will furnish the facilities required in the shortest possible interval of
time and at the minimum of expense.

To erect an edifice of the necessary magnitude, in the style of architecture hereto-
fore adopted by the Government for its use in Washington, would involve an
expenditure of many millions of dollars, and it could not be completed and available
for occupation in a shorter period than from five to eight years. Nevertheless, on a
simple plan originally suggested by General Meigs, a building somewhat similar in
character to those erected for the National Exposition, 300 feet square, or having an
area of 90,000 square feet—something over two acres—pertectly fireproof, amply
lighted, and properly adapted for all its objects, can be constructed for about
$250,000, and can be ready for occupation within ten months, or at most a year, from
the time of its commencement.

By the plan contemplated everything would be on one floor, without any stairways
or second story, no cellar or fireproof floor being required. The single floor of the
building to be of concrete, and thus water and vermin proof; the walls and other
portions of the building of brick, and the beams, rafters, and framework of the roof
of iron, without a particle of wood.

It is therefore much to be desired that the means be furnished at an early day for
the construction of this building, so that the rich material now belonging to the
United States Government can be utilized.
244 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

It is believed that-when properly arranged the National Museum of the United
States will take rank as one of the great industrial and economical displays of the
natural resources of the globe. The accommodation will then be afforded for the
exhibition of the mineral wealth of every State and Territory, and the display of
samples of every new mine, with all the appliances for rendering the study of the
whole interesting and profitable. The coals, the marbles, and other ornamental
minerals will be exhibited systematically; the useful and ornamental products
and derivatives of the animal kingdom will be shown—not only such as relate to the
United States, but with illustrations of the whole subject in other parts of the world—
which can not fail to suggest new and important applications in this country.
Illustrations of the food and other fishes of this and other countries, the best meth-
ods of securing them and of preparing them for the requirements of mankind, and
the varied productions of the aboriginal races of North America can also be displayed
on a proper scale.

During the second session of the same Congress the bill for a new
building was again brought up in both Houses. Brief remarks were
made in the Senate and the bill slightly amended in regard to the
wording relative to location. It was passed as an item in the sundry
civil act for 1880 in the following terms:

For a fireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300 feet square, to be
erected under the direction and supervision of the Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, in accordance with the plans now on file with the Joint Committee of Public
Buildings and Grounds, on the southeastern portion of the grounds of the Smithso-
nian Institution, $250,000: said building to be placed east of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, leaving a roadway between it and the latter of not less than 50 feet, with its
north front on a line with the south face of the buildings of the Agricultural Depart-
ment and af the Smithsonian Institution; and all expenditures for the purposes
herein mentioned, not including anything for architectural plans, shall be audited
by the proper officers of the Treasury Department.

The following extracts from the report of the building commission,
submitted January 19, 1880, give a summary of the building opera-
tions for 1879:

Anticipating the early action of Congress in the premises, the Board of Regents,
on the 17th of January, 1879, adopted the following resolution:

“* Resolved, That the executive committee of the Board, or a majority thereof, and
the Secretary be, and they are hereby, authorized and empowered to act for and in
the name of the Board of Regents in carrying into effect the provisions of any act of
Congress that may be passed providing for the erection of a building for the National
Museum.”’

Accordingly, on the 7th of March, 1879, Hon. Peter Parker and Gen. W. T. Sherman,
the resident members of the executive committee, with the Secretary, met in the office
of the Institution, and after organizing under the title of ‘‘ National Museum Build-
ing Commission,’’ of which Gen. W. T. Sherman was chosen chairman, proceeded
to adopt such measures as in their opinion appeared best calculated to realize, with
the least possible delay, the intention of Congress.

The committee at the outset invited Gen. M. C. Meigs, Quartermaster-General
U. 8. Army, to act in the capacity of consulting engineer to the commission, and
also selected Messrs. Cluss & Schulze, whose plans for the new building were those
approved by Congress, as superintending architects. Mr. Daniel Leech was appointed
secretary of the commission.

To remove as far as possible any doubt as to the sufficiency of the appropriation
for a building in accordance with the plans approved by Congress, Mr. Edward
Clark, Architect of the Capitol, and General Meigs, after carefully considering the
provisional estimates of the architects, informed the commission that in their opinion
the amount was sufficient for the purpose.

To obtain a clear understanding of the intent of Congress in making the appro-
priation, as well as to ascertain how far, if desirable, the commission might be
authorized to depart from the plans before the Committees of Public Buildings and
Grounds when the act was passed, the chairmen of the respective committees (Hon.
H. L. Dawes and Hon. Philip Cook) were consulted; whereupon these gentlemen
officially informed the commission ‘‘that, provided the general design be retained,
it was not their intention, nor that of their committees, to confine the Board of
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to the minor details of the aforesaid plans,
but to authorize any modifications that might appear to them desirable in the interest
of economy or for the better adaptation of the building to its object.”

On ascertaining that the appropriation could be made immediately available under
zhe clause directing that the accounts should be audited by the proper officers of the
Treasury Department, the Secretary of the Treasury was, on the 27th of March,
requested to designate some one of his force to act as disbursing officer. Accord-
ingly Maj. T. J. Hobbs, disbursing clerk of the Department, was selected, and pay-
ments were authorized to be made by him on vouchers approved by the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution as provided for in the following resolution:

‘* Resolved, That the commission appointed by the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution to superintend the construction of a new fireproof building for the
National Museum hereby authorize Prof. 8. F. Baird, Secretary of the Institution, to
act as their agent to approve for payment by Thomas J. Hobbs, all bills for services and
supplies from such funds as are placed in the hands of the latter by said commission
for such purposes, and the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby respectfully requested
to instruct Thomas J. Hobbs, disbursing agent, to pay any bills when thus certified
and found to be otherwise technically correct.’’

Having thus prepared the way to a commencement of active operations, specifica-
tions were at once prepared and proposals invited for carrying on the work. Ground
was broken on the 17th of April, 1879.

The concrete foundations were begun on the 29th of April, and the brickwork of
the walls on the 21st of May, the main walls being completed on the Ist day of
November.

In consequence of the low prices of the more important building matevials, very
favorable contracts were made, especially for the brick required and for the ironwork,
since the price of iron advanced very materially within a few months from the date
referred to. The same is true with regard to glass, bricks, and in fact almost all

building materials.
* * * * * * *

The estimate of $250,000 for the construction of a museum building did not include
the heating apparatus. As the work progressed, however, it became evident that all
the underground piping for water, gas, and steam, at least, could be obtained from
the fund.

In anticipation of an appropriation for the purpose, it was deemed best to obtain
provisional bids for a steam-heating apparatus. Accordingly proposals were invited:
First, for the underground pipes; second, for the boilers; third, for the radiators.
The aggregate of the estimates for the three items varied from $13,940 to $55,680.

The lowest bid was rejected on account of inadequacy of the supply of heat. The
next to the lowest was that of Messrs. Baker, Smith & Co., for $19,768, which was
accepted, and a contract made for the underground pipes for $5,770.

An appropriation of $30,000 has been asked of. Congress for the completion of the
246 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

heating apparatus throughout, for the gas and water fixtures and the electric appa-
ratus required for clocks in the building, for signals, alarms, ete.

Before the building can be occupied it must of course be furnished and fitted up
with cases, of which, as might be expected, a large provision is required. According
to acaleulation, the cases that will be needed, if placed end to end, will extend to a
distance of more than 8,000 feet, with a total of shelving surface of about 75,000 square
feet. The frontage of the cases will be over 14,000 feet, so that, allowing for the cross-
ing from one case to another, a journey of at least 3 miles will be required even to
take a cursory glance at all the objects in the collection.

The question of the best material for the cases has not been definitely settled,
the choice lying between iron and hard wood. In order to assist in determining this
question satisfactorily, arrangements have been made to obtain working plans of the
‘ases used not only in a number of museums in the United States, especially in Cam-
bridge, Boston, and New York, but also in Europe. The new building now being
erected for the collections of the British Museum is one where it is supposed the
best experience has been made use of in the plans of the cases, and arrangements
have been made to obtain copies of the same. The new iron cases of the national
museum at Dresden are also under investigation. Iron is more expensive than wood,
but involves less danger of decay, and there is also an especial advantage in the fact
that the material may be so much thinner as to increase the interior space, while the
objects in the cases are less obscured. Of course it must not be forgotten that the
National Museum is expected to discharge its functions for an indefinite period of
years.

The provision of Congress directed that the new building should be placed to the
east of the present Smithsonian edifice, at least 50 feet from its southeastern corner.
The question was considered of having the interval greater than this minimum, but it
was found that this would involve the extension of the building beyond the boundary
of the Smithsonian reservation and carry it to the unassigned portion of the square.
Although there was nothing in the act to prevent this encroachment, yet in view of
the possibility that the southeastern portion of the public land between Seventh and
Twelfth streets would be required for some other purposes, perhaps for a Congres-
sional Library, it was thought best to encroach upon it as little as possible.

In addition to its answering the purpose for which it was primarily intended, it is
confidently believed that the new National Museum building will exercise an
important function in serving as a model for similar establishments elsewhere.

Of course in a city where the cost of land is a matter of important consideration,
the one-story plan can not always be carried out, the usual position of story above
story being necessary to secure the desired space. Most colleges and universities,
however, have ample grounds belonging to them, the occupation of which by large
buildings is allowable. Under such circumstances the same amount of fireproof
space can be had for from two-thirds to one-half the usual cost.

The office of member of the building commission has been by no means a sinecure,
weekly meetings having been held, with scarcely an interruption, from the first
organization, as shown by the full reports kept of the proceedings. General Meigs,
as consulting engineer, until his recent departure on a tour of duty, was present at
every meeting and continually aided the commission by his advice, rendered so
valuable by his long familiarity with building operations on a large scale and with
the whole question of the proper construction of contracts. He visited the grounds
nearly every day and closely inspected the progress of the work. To him are also
due valuable suggestions on the methods of covering the roofs and on other details.

Two subsequent reports were made by the building commission—one
covering the year 1880, the other 1881. In these the progress of the
work and the dates of completion of important parts of the building

were noted. The roofs were finished in April, L880, and the plaster-
ing by the latter part of July. In the interest of economy in heating
all outside windows were furnished with two panes of glass. Wooden
floors were laid in 1880 in all the halls, except the four courts, the
four main halls or naves, and the rotunda. Congress was asked for
an appropriation to defray the expense of a marble or tile floor for the
naves and rotunda, and $26,000 was allowed for this purpose, becoming
available in the summer of 1881. The rotunda was then supplied with
a floor of encaustic tiles and the main halls with floors of marble tiles.
The approaches to the building were constructed out of the original
appropriation.

The final report of the commission, dated January 2, 1882, closes as
follows:

In closing this its third annual report, the National Museum building commission
congratulates the Regents that the new building for the National Museum is so far
completed as to be ready for occupancy, and in now asking the Board to take charge
of the edifice the commission begs to refer to the important fact that, while a build-
ing is presented equal in every respect to what was anticipated in case provision
should be made for additional quarters for the national collections intrusted to the
care of the Smithsonian Institution, instead of incurring a deficiency, the fund has
been so yaanaged as to have to its credit at the present moment an available balance
of some thousands of dollars.

Having fulfilled the duties with which it was charged by your resolution of Janu-
ary 17, 1879, the commission would respectfully ask to be discharged and to be author-
ized to turn over to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution the building itself,
and to the United States Treasury whatever balance of money may remain after
liquidating the last liability on account of the construction of the edifice.

The appropriations which had been made for the building were as

The subjects intended to be represented in the new building were
stated by Secretary Baird, in his report for 1879, to be as follows:

The period of complete installation of collections on hand and the opening of the
building to the public will depend upon the amount of the appropriation and the
rapidity with which the contractors may complete their work. The new building
will be devoted more particularly to industrial exhibits, intended to show the
animal and mineral resources of the United States and their practical applications
to the wants or luxuries of man. The department of anthropology will also be
largely represented. How far natural history can find a place in the building will
depend upon the space required for the collections mentioned. It ‘is confidently
expected that this building when finished will be one of the most attractive objects
of the kind extant and but little inferior to the celebrated museums of foreign
countries.
248 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

In his report for 1880 he says:

[ now have the pleasure of stating that the work has been in the greater part
completed during the year 1880 and that a portion of the building is already occu-
pied for its legitimate objects.

The details of progress and completion will be given in full in the report of the
building committee and of the architect, to which I would refer. It will be suffi-
cient to say here that the work has all been done within the estimates and that it
promises to be even more suitable to its purpose than was anticipated. All the
requirements in regard to light and heat are fully met, and in this respect and in
that of its slight cost in proportion to the space obtained, the building is believed to
have no parallel in the country. Including the building proper, the steam heating
apparatus, the gas and water fixtures, and. all their accessories, the cost has
amounted to less than $3 per square foot of ground floor and to about 6 cents per
cubic foot of entire capacity.

The first use of the building was for the inaugural reception to
President Garfield on March 4, 1881, which was granted in accordance
with the following resolution of the Regents at a meeting held on
December 8, 1880:

Whereas the new Museum building is unfinished and not ready for occupancy of
the Government collections, and whereas such a contingency will not again occur,
and that no precedent is to be given for the use of the building for other purposes:

Resolved, That the use of the new National Museum building be granted for the
inaugural reception of the President of the United States on the 4th of March, 1881,
and that the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution be authorized to make all
necessary arrangements for this purpose.

In 1881 Professor Baird stated that the building might then be con-
sidered as completed and ready for its final occupation by the various
departments which have been assigned to it. Some small additions and
alterations were still required to be made, but they did not interfere
with the general use of the structure. In the beginning certain office
and laboratory quarters were granted to the United States Geological
Survey, especially in the northeast pavilion, and they continued to be
so used for several years.

It was soon recognized that the building was too small to provide all
the necessary accommodations, even though the Museum continued in
possession of the same space in the Smithsonian building as before,
and the inconvenience from this source increased rapidly with time. It
thus also resulted that not all of the halls could be used for exhibition
purposes as intended, and until lately some of them have always been
closed to the public, that they might be employed for storage, for
unpacking, or for workrooms.

There have been from the beginning many changes in the assign-
ment of space to the different departments, but transfers from one
building to the other have been few since the occupation of the newer
structure. The clearing up of the exhibition halls, which were never
in as good condition as now, has been mainly accomplished by the
heroic method of sending large quantities of specimens to outside stor-

age and by the fitting up of a few outside workrooms. Another factor
in this direction has been the construction of a number of galleries,
as explained below.

Secretary Baird says, in his report for 1882, that—

The Museum building was received from the hands of the architects in so complete
a state that but little remained to be done beyond the tinting of a portion of the
walls and the filling up of some of the alcoves with canyas frames, ete. There is
yet much to be done, however, in the construction of the necessary cases for the
accommodation of collections.

The building of cases has, in fact, never ceased, for, while the more
urgent needs were early supplied, cases of one description or another
have been added from year to year. Many cases used at national
expositions have been returned in so defaced a condition that it has
been necessary to reject or rebuild them, and cases of new and im-
proved patterns have replaced many of the older ones.

In 1883 Professor Baird remarks that the ‘t building continues to
preserve the reputation it has acquired as representing the maximum
of convenience and adaptation to its purposes with the minimum of
original cost and expense for repairs; and in 1885 he states that the
‘building is in excellent condition and has required comparatively
little in the way of repairs.”

After not many years, however, certain weak points began to
develop, and these have been the cause of much concern and have
necessitated almost continuous repairs, though seldom at great expense.
The walls are essentially substantial, but the roof was constructed at too
little cost and is far below the standard of the brickwork. Its weak-
ness and incompleteness is evident both in the supporting framework
and in the covering. The framework has given way in places under
heavy falls of snow, and the covering has developed numerous leaks,
most commonly about the breaks in the roof, but elsewhere as well,
and the constant attention of one mechanic has been insufficient to
keep these leaks under control. While it is intended soon to renew
the worst of this covering, it is now quite certain that a considerable
part of the roof must be wholly rebuilt before many years.

The leaks from the roof have so constantly defaced the inside walls
of the naves and courts that only recently has it been deemed advisa-

ie to repaint them, a work which was mainly accomplished during
1902 and 1903, and which has greatly improved the appearance of the
exhibition halls.

The principal other changes in the interior of the building, in the
nature of permanent improvements, have been the replacement of the
wooden floors with cement, the building of galleries in nearly all
the halls, and the addition of some skylights. The first has improved
both the conditions and the appearance of the halls, and as the floors
were without proper foundation the former wooden covering was
250 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

inadequate to keep out the moisture or impurities from the soil. The
galleries have materially increased the amount of space, and the new
skylights were rendered necessary by their introduction. These fea-
tures may be briefly referred to as follows:

In some of the preliminary drawings for the museum building a tier
of galleries is shown in each of the exhibition halls, but in the plans as
finally adopted and presented to Congress these features were not
represented. The height of the several halls, however, was made
sufficient to permit of their introduction at any time. In view of the
failure to secure early action by Congress toward the erection of a
third building, it was decided to urge the construction of these gal-
leries, in order that some additional space might be acquired. The
entire sum needed for such a purpose was not requested at once, but
the estimates for 1893, 1894, 1895, and 1896 each contained an item of
$8,000. These failed to receive favorable consideration by Congress,
but the amount named was appropriated in the sundry civil act for
1897, and other appropriations followed, namely, $8,000 in 1898,
$10,000 in 1899, and $5,000 in 1902, making a total of $31,000 for this
purpose. From this amount galleries were erected in all the halls,
courts, and ranges, except the north hall and the northeast and east-
north ranges. In the southeast range the galleries have been extended
so as to form a complete second floor. Though intended primarily
for exhibition purposes, it has been necessary to assign certain of the
galleries to the storage of reserve collections and as workrooms, as
elsewhere explained.

The only substantial floors laid in the beginning were those in the
rotunda and the four main halls, as already described, the former
being of encaustic tiles, the latter of marble squares. The remaining
floors in all parts of the main building were of wood. The latter
were allowed to remain until thoroughly worn out, being gradually
replaced by more durable material. These changes began in 1891 and
were not completed until 1900. The first of the new floors, and, in
fact, the greater number, were constructed of cement, granito, and
granolithic; the last four were made of terrazzo pavement, small
irregular pieces of marble, laid in cement, and are the most satisfac-
tory, in appearance at least.

The other work of repair and alteration, conducted at the expense
of the general appropriation for this purpose, need not be analyzed
here. It has produced, as a whole, many marked improvements,
though for the most part it has been directed toward maintaining the
building in as fair a condition as the funds have permitted.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. O51
NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING.
DESCRIPTION.

In describing the present Museum building,“ the architects, Messrs.
Cluss & Schulze, spoke of it as follows:

A modernized Romanesque style of architecture was adopted for the new building
in order to keep up a relationship with the Smithsonian building, which is designed
in Norman, a variety of this style. To modernize this style was found necessary
on account of the different building material, and to do justice to the purposes of the
building with its modern demands of perfect safety and elegance of construction, of
greatest possible available floor space, of easy communications, efficient drainage, a
well-calculated and pleasing admission of light, free circulation of air, and all other
hygienic dicta.

The external architecture is based upon the general arrangement of the interior,
and shows plainly the prominence of the four naves and the careful management of
the light for the central portion of the building. The main entrances are in the
centers of each facade between two lofty towers of 86 feet height, which act as but-
tresses for the naves. Between the towers, and receding from the doorways, there
are large arched windows set with ornamented glass, and above those the gables of
the naves are formed; they contain inscription plates, and are crowned by allegorical
groups of statuary. The group over the northern gable, designed by C. Buberl, of
New York, already in position, introduces Columbia as the protectress of science and
TACLUISHEY. ee) 1

On the whole, the one-story plan which has prevailed among experts ever since
he Paris exhibition of 1867 has been adopted. But by the introduction of upper
stories on those outlying sections reserved for offices, ample office room has been
secured without encroaching materially upon the floor space within the square of
300 feet to which the building was primarily limited.

Whatever may be the style of architecture represented, the exterior
of the building can not lay claim to dignity of appearance or to any
degree of esthetic merit, although by a symmetrical arrangement of
towers and pavilions some relief is given to the low outer walls, and,
viewed a short distance off, the tops of the former mingle with the
roofs and lantern skylights to produce a not unpicturesque, though
crude, effect. The walls are of brick, the roofs principally of iron
and slate. The former were well constructed, and should long remain
in good condition, but the latter were early found to be, in greater
part, unsuitable and insecure. These defects were largely due to the
smallness of the appropriation, only $250,000, which did not permit
of the best class of workmanship and material, and the failure to pro-
duce a better architectural effect can probably also be accounted for
in the same way.

The interior is plain, and its walls are frequently defaced through
the imperfections of the roofs, but the many criticisms which, from
the beginning, have been directed against the arrangement of the
building are entirely unwarranted. For the purpose for which it
was erected, the exhibition of specimens, it probably has no superior

« Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1879, pp. 150, 131.
252 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

in this country and few, if any, abroad. The critics have simply con-
founded cheapness and crudeness with inadaptation to purpose. It is
a square building of a single story, consisting of four large naves
and a central rotunda in the shape of a Greek cross, with ranges and
covered courts filling in the corners, so as to produce a solid or
continuous structure every part of which, under the original plan,
was well lighted. The ranges have large windows, and the naves and
courts both skylights and clerestory windows. It is the plan so often
adopted for exposition buildings, and also at times for permanent
structures, and is especially convenient to the visitor, in that he has
no stairs to climb. There has at no time in the past been any difficulty
in so installing the display collections that they could be distinctly
seen and the labels read. Within a few years, however, galleries have
been built in nearly all the halls, as it was necessary to increase the
amount of space. The height of the halls has permitted this to be
done without injury to the general effect, but to some extent the light-
ing has been interfered with, though not so much but that it can be
remedied.

This building was planned, as above stated, essentially for exhibi-
tion purposes. The space available for laboratories and storage
quarters, however, is wholly inadequate, though convenient and well
lighted. This may be considered as one of the main defects of the
interior, as it is the one most noticeable to the specialist who wants
working room, and seldom refers to the exhibition series. A remedy »
for this condition, recommended and urged upon Congress by Pro-
fessor Baird, was the erection of a smaller fireproof building nearby,
entirely for laboratory and storage needs, and especially for the safe-
guarding of the alcoholic collections. His ideas were never carried
out, but it is hoped that in the new building all of these requirements
will be provided.

The building has, moreover, served an excellent purpose as an
object lesson, since the experience gained in its construction and fur-
nishing, and in the installation of its collections, has been invaluable
in the preparations for the newer structure. It will undoubtedly con-
tinue to be occupied for many years to come, and its complete repair
will probably be undertaken as soon as the new building is finished.

The building under description stands on the southeast corner of the
reservation granted to the Smithsonian Institution by the fundamental
act of 1846, and, in fact, overreaches its eastern boundary to about
the extent of the width of Ninth street SW. Its north or front face is
about on a line with the south face of the Smithsonian building, from
which its nearest corner is distant about 50 feet, while its rear face
adjoins the sidewalk on B street south.

The main part of the building is about 300 feet square and one story
high throughout, though of very different elevations. In the center

of each front, at the sides of the entrance, are two tall towers, and at
the corners are large pavilions, all of which project about 124 feet
from the main walls, thus making the extreme linear dimensions of
the building about 325 feet. The amount of ground covered is 97,786
square feet, or about 24 acres.

~The primary feature of the plan consists of four naves or main
halls, the largest in the building, which radiate in the form of a Greek
cross from a central rotunda to the towers above mentioned. Follow-
ing the outer walls and extending from the naves to the pavilions are
a series of eight ranges, two on each side. This arrangement leaves
four courts, inclosed by the naves and ranges, which are roofed over
and form parts of the actual building. There are, therefore, 17 halls
in the body of the building, all designed for exhibition purposes.
These halls are separated by heavy brick walls, having numerous
broad arched openings reaching nearly to the ceiling. The lower part
of these openings both from the floor and from the galleries are filled
in with cases or screens, except where needed as passageways. The
main halls open broadly into the rotunda. There is one entrance into
each court, and one at each end of the several ranges for the circula-
tion of the public.

The central rotunda attains the greatest height. It is octagonal
below, with a maximum diameter of 65 feet, and is surmounted by a
16-sided polygon, 67 feet in diameter, which contains a tier of large
windows, and is covered with a slate roof rising to a central lantern.
The height is 77 feet on the side walls, and 108 feet to the top of the
lantern finial. The four main halls, extending from the inner walls of
the towers to the rotunda, are 117 feet long by 65 feet wide, their
height being 42 feet to the top of the side walls, and 56 feet to the
ridge of the roof. The courts are about 63 feet square and of the
same wall height as the main halls. The ranges are alla little less than
50 feet wide. Those on the north and south sides of the building are
89 feet long, and those on the east and west sides 63 feet long, the
lesser length of the latter being due to extensions from the adjoining
‘pavilions. They are covered with lean-to roofs, their interior height
being 264 feet at the outer walls and 31 feet at the inner.

The several divisions of the building are clearly indicated on the
exterior by the unequal heights of the walls and roofs. A description
of these features as seen when approaching the north front will answer
for the other sides, as all are essentially alike. In the center of the
north front is the main entrance, bordered by a tall, arched frame-
work of Ohio sandstone. Above and back of the entrance are the face
and gable end of the north hall, reaching to a height of about 55 feet
above the ground, bearing a stone plate with the inscription ‘* National
Museum, 1879,” and surmounted by an allegorical group of statuary
representing Columbia as the protectress of science and industry. At
254 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

each side of the entrance is one of the towers above mentioned, about
27 feet square and three stories high, topped by a steep roof, with
small dormer windows toward the base. The extreme heights of these
towers is 855 feet to the top of the finial.

Extending on each side from the towers to the corner pavilions are
curtain walls, 273 feet high and 87 feet long, with seven broad, arched
windows, 8 feet 10 inches wide and 13 feet 7 inches high, the glass in
the latter being arranged in three vertical series. Between the win-
dows are narrow buttresses, uniting above in arches. The pavilions
are about 40 feet square and 36% feet high to the eaves, the roofs being
much Jower and flatter than on the towers. They are divided into
three stories, besides a basement, each lighted by eight large, arched
windows, except the upper story, which has three small windows
grouped in the center on each side. The top of each pavilion has a
large lantern skylight.

From the curtain walls the lean-to metal roof rises over the ranges
with moderate slope, and abuts against the higher walls of the courts
and main halls, both of which have a row of clerestory windows on
each side facing the ranges, those of the main halls extending back only
as far as the courts. The courts have a large square lantern, from
which the roof descends on all four sides to the level of the gutters on
the main halls. The main halls have plain hip roofs about the same
height as those of the courts, with elongate lantern skylights in the
middle. The dome of the rotunda, as before explained, rises above
all other portions of the roof, being the most conspicuous feature of
the top of the building. All the roofs are covered with slate except
those of the ranges, which are of tin. The slates are nailed to small
pieces of wood, titted into small L-shaped pieces of iron, and the plas-
ter of the ceiling is laid directly upon the rough inner surface so
formed. Besides the lanterns before mentioned, a number of small
skylights and ventilators have been built over some of the ranges and
courts, especially where the recently constructed galleries have inter-
fered with the lighting.

The entire framework, as well as the inner sheathing of the roofs,
are exposed to view, this plan having been followed in the interest
of economy. The roofs of the main halls, the rotunda, and the courts
are supported by iron trusses of the Pratt pattern; those over the
ranges by triangular girders of rivited angle iron. In 1894 some of
the purlines in the main halls near the rotunda began to buckle and
were reenforced with angle iron. By 1900 all of the iron work over
the main halls had begun to show signs of weakness, caused by alternate
expansion and contraction, thus producing many leaks in the slate
covering, and the entire framework was accordingly braced and
strengthened by means of angle steel. The woodwork about the lan-
terns was also replaced by iron, and other improvements were made.

‘
Cn

NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 25

The inner surface of all the roofs was originally covered with a thin
coat of plaster. In the ranges the metal top was underlaid by fireproof
gratings, to which the plaster was applied. As the keying proved
insufficient or the plaster not strong enough, large pieces began to
give way at the very beginning, and to eliminate this source of danger
all the plaster was removed in the ranges, leaving the gratings uncoy-
ered. After being painted, however, the appearance of the ceiling
proved not to be out of keeping with its surroundings. In one range
the ceiling was at the same time covered with corrugated iron, leaving
an air space between it and the tin roof above, and it was thought by
the architects that this arrangement would tend to regulate the tem-
perature of the halls. Nothing further, however, has been done in
this direction.

Through failure to secure additional space by the erection of a new
building, galleries began to be added in the present building in 1896,
and their construction was continued from year to year until 1902.
They are now contained in all the halls except the north hall and the
north-east and east-north ranges, while in the south-east range they
have been united so as to forma complete second story. The main
entrances to the galleries are from the rotunda, and nearly the entire
series may be traversed without descending to the floor. The width
of the galleries is from 10 to 14 feet and their height above the floor
16 feet. They are of very simple construction, consisting of plain
iron pillars and girders, with brick archways and cement floors. The
area gained by this means has amounted to 25,828 square feet.

All of the masonry of the exterior walls above ground, except as
noted below, is of red brick laid in black mortar, with numerous hor-
izontal courses of black brick, and a considerable quantity of buff
brick in courses and designs to relieve the monotony of color. A
number of blue brick were originally employed in connection with
the buff, but they were subsequently painted black. There is a base
course of granite around the entire building, but the window sills,
copings, ete., are of gray Ohio sandstone.

The interior walls are plastered in a sand finish, and were originally
covered with a gray water-color paint, poorly adapted as a background
for installation. The exhibition cases have been mainly constructed
with mahogany frames, for which maroon was found to be a most har-
monizing and effective surrounding, and since about 1883 most of the
walls have been painted this color toa height of about 12 feet from
the floor, the original color remaining for the most part above. The
only decorations were stenciled figures on the walls of the rotunda
and over the archways at the inner ends of the main halls. In 1902,
however, experiments were made looking to a change of color, with
what is regarded as very satisfactory results. The colors used in the
main halls and courts are a light red to a height of 15 feet, followed
256 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

by a deep ivory, the ceilings being of a lighter ivory. In the rotunda
the colors range from olive below to ivory above, with stencil decora-
tions as shown in the plates. This color scheme has not’ been extended
to the ranges, which have been repainted from time to time in various
colors.

In connection with the original construction of the building, though
under a special appropriation, a floor of encaustic tiles was laid in the
rotunda, and floors of marble squares of various colors in the four
large halls or naves. The marble tiling is surrounded by a frieze of
dark-blue slate, of sufficient width to bridge the ducts containing the
steam pipes, wires, etc., while around the frieze is a border of parti-
colored Portland cement. The floors in all the other halls were con-
structed of yellow pine, partly in preparation for the Garfield inaugu-
ral ball of March 4, 1881, out of the local fund for that purpose.
These floors were laid upon a concrete base and began to decay after
avery few years, requiring frequent and extensive repairs. In 1891
it became necessary to replace several of them with more substantial
material, and this continued down to 1898, when the last of the wooden
floors disappeared. The substitutes have been cement, granito, and
finally terrazzo, the last being the most pleasing and apparently the
most durable. Other floor changes have consisted in the laying of
mosaic pavements in the vestibules of the main entrance and the north-
west entrance. In the pavilions and towers the different stories are
separated by arches of brick and concrete, supported by iron beams,
the floor covering being of Florida pine. Thus the building has been
rendered essentially fireproof in all parts of its’construction.

An octagonal fountain basin, 20 feet in diameter, composed of a rim
of molded polished granite and cement floor, occupies the middle of
the rotunda. From its center rises the original plaster model of the
goddess of liberty which, in bronze, surmounts the Dome of the
United States Capitol.

As before stated, the building was constructed with four main
entrances, one at the center of each front, but only two of these are
now used as such, that on the north side being for the public and that
on the east side for the delivery of supplies and specimens. The
entrances on the south and west have been closed and, together with
the adjacent space, converted into headquarters for the departments
of biology and anthropology, respectively. There is also a small
entrance on the south side of the northwest pavilion leading directly
to the administrative offices. |

The north, or main, entrance has two sets of double doors of black
walnut paneled with heavy plate glass, the large arched space above
being filled in with a latticework of walnut set with glass. In front
of the entrance is a mosaic platform, bordered by granite coping, and

approached by four low granite steps 37 feet long, which are flanked
by molded base blocks carrying large candelabra.

The smallness of the original appropriation prevented the construc-
tion of a basement under the main building, which would have added
a large amount of space for storage and workrooms. Small cellars
were built, however, under the southwest pavilion for the heating
boilers and the supply of fuel and under the northwest and northeast
pavilions for miscellaneous storage. Advantage was taken of the
changes in the heating plant in 1901 to construct an underground tun-
nel, leading from the northwest pavilion of the Museum building ‘o
the east wing of the Smithsonian building, primarily to convey the
heating pipes, electrical conduits, etc., but of suitable dimensions to
serve as a passageway for individuals, being 70 feet long, 5 feet wide,
and 7 feet high. It has proved of great convenience in stormy weather,
but fills a much more important purpose at night by giving the small
watch force a ready means of communication between the two buildings.

The building is exceedingly well lighted, considering its solid, one-
story construction. The ranges are amply provided with large win-
dows, the higher naves and courts have both skylights and clerestory
windows, and the naves also receive much light from the large win-
dows between the central towers. The exhibition collections can,
therefore, asa rule, be readily seen, though the galleries are responsible
for the creation of some dark places which did not formerly exist.
The lighting of the rooms in the towers and pavilions is also excellent.
The windows are practically all of the same general pattern, and in
the beginning all were glazed with double panes of glass, the better
to retain the heat in winter, but about half of these double panes in
the towers and pavilions have been made single. Ventilation is pro-
vided for by means of movable panes of glass in the side windows and
lanterns, many sashes being pivoted in iron frames for that purpose,
and also in places by ventilators in the roof.

In 1881 the Museum was presented by the Brush Electrical Company
with a number of storage cells and a dynamo suitable for operating
between 30 and 40 incandescent and 16-candle power lamps in the
lecture hall when evening meetings were held. In 1895 the basement
of the south tower of the Smithsonian Institution was furnished with
a gas engine and dynamo of sufficient power to maintain a small system
of incandescent lamps in the Smithsonian offices and in a number of
workrooms and other dark places in both buildings. This plant was
totally inadequate for the requirements, however, and Congress
appropriated $3,500 in L901, and $5,000 in 1902, for a complete instal-
lation of electric wires and fixtures throughout the Museum building,
which was practically finished in the latter year, the work being done
by employees of the Museum. This installation extends to the public
halls, offices, laboratories, storerooms, and workshops, but in the

NAT Mus 1903——17
258 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Smithsonian building it reaches only some of the offices and corridors,
a few storerooms, and the dark center of the main exhibition hall.
The current for lighting is taken from the mains of one of the city
companies at the southwest corner of the Museum building. On only
a few occasions has the entire Museum building been lighted at night,
and regular night opening for the public can not be undertaken without
an additional appropriation to cover the extra expense of electric
current and watchmen.

All of the cases in the exhibition halls containing especially valu-
able specimens, as in the historical and gem collections, are supplied
with electric burglar alarms. There is also a system of electric call
boxes distributed through both buildings, which must be visited every
hour during the night watches, any failure to perform this service
being at once automatically announced at the office of the Mutual Dis-
trict Messenger Company in the city. For the prompt conduct of
business it has likewise been found necessary to make extensive use of
the telephone system for communication between offices in different
parts of the building and with the city.

The heating of the Museum building was until 1901 accomplished
by means of four 60-horsepower steam boilers. In the latter year
these were replaced by two 150-horsepower high-pressure tubular
boilers, whose capacity is sufficient to heat both of the large buildings
and the smaller adjacent buildings on the Mall. The boiler room is in
the basement of the southwest pavilion. There are also two boilers of
48-horsepower in the basement of the Smithsonian building, which
can be used incase of emergency. The new plant is very satisfactory,
and much more economical than the old one.

Soon after the Museum building was completed, the north-west range
was set apart as a temporary lecture hall, being furnished with a plat-
form, lantern screen, and several hundred folding chairs. This. was
one of the smaller ranges, and proving inadequate for the require-
ments, its fittings, somewhat improved, were transferred to the west-
north range, which continued to be assigned to this purpose, though
sometimes used for the preparation of exhibits, until the increasing
demands for exhibition space caused it to be turned over to the Depart-
ment of Anthropology. It was found, however, practically essential
to have some place for scientific meetings, and by placing material in
storage it became possible to vacate for this purpose the east-north
range, immediately to the east of the main entrance, and thus equally
as convenient as the former range. The hall remains in a condition
suitable to be turned over to exhibition uses at any time, but its
fixtures for lecture purposes are more permanent in character than
before. The walls and ceiling have been painted in several tints of
green. There is a large speaker’s platform and a lantern screen, and
on the opposite side a smaller platform or balcony, where the lantern

can be permanently installed. Movable armchairs are used for seats,
and a series of screens are in readiness to reduce or enlarge the lecture
space, according to the requirements. The furniture is entirely of
oak. The preparation of this new lecture hall was accomplished in
1901, under a special Congressional appropriation.

The three floor rooms of the east tower south of the entrance, with
a slight addition for kitchen purposes, were utilized for a lunch room
until 1901. In that year, however, the addition referred to was
extended southward to a total length of 77-feet, thus somewhat enlarg-
ing and improving the conditions, but there is no way of providing a
suitable lunch room in the present building, important as this feature
is to the employees and to such visitors as spend much time about the
Museum.

In connection with the plans of the building (pp. 299-302) a list is
given of the halls and of all the rooms contained in the several towers
and pavilions, together with their sizes and an explanation of the uses
to which each is put. The exhibitions in geology and in anthropology,
except the single division of archeology, are entirely in this building.
In biology only the mammals, reptiles, fishes, and comparative anat-
omy are represented here, the remaining divisions being provided for

In the Smithsonian building. All of the galleries as well as the halls

were designed for exhibition purposes, but three or four of the former
are now used for storage, and one for the library. The administra-
tive offices and the headquarters for the three scientific departments
are in this building, as well as most of the scientific laboratories.

BUILDING FOR THE ALCOHOLIC COLLECTIONS.

Professor Baird stated in his report for 1884 that—

The presence of alcoholic specimens in large numbers, so important in a scien-
tific point of view, greatly endangers the safety of museum buildings and their con-
tents, and most of the establishments in Europe have lately taken the precaution to
construct separate buildings peculiarly adapted for the purpose. An application was
made at the last session of Congress for an appropriation to put up a similar build-
ing in the grounds of the Institution, but it was not acted upon favorably.

The estimate was as follows:

For the erection of a fireproof brick storage building east of the National Museum,
for receiving, unpacking, assorting, and storing the natural-history collections of the
Government, to replace the wooden structures now used for the purpose, $10,000.

The estimates were renewed for 1886 and 1887 in the following
terms:

For the erection of a fireproof building for storing the alcoholic collections of the
National Museum, $15,000.

(Nore.—The safety of the interior of the National Museum and the Smithsonian
building is endangered by the large number of alcoholic specimens kept therein, and
tis considered by public museums, both at home and abroad, very important to
260 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

have a separate building for their reception and preservation. There are at present
no suitable accommodations for these collections. )
In 1885 Secretary Baird remarked that—

Although the present building 1s practically fireproof, yet should a fire be started
in the vicinity of these [the alcoholic] specimens it is probable that much damage
would be done by the ignition of the many thousands of gallons of aleohol, and the
destruction of the specimens and of the jars in which they are contained.

Again in 1886 he refers to the danger of the destruction not only of
the alcoholic specimens themselves, but of other near-by collections
should fire break out among the former. All of these propositions
failed to receive consideration and the matter was not renewed, as it
was then expected to make provision for the alcoholic specimens in the
proposed new Museum building. |

In connection with the appropriations for 1899, however, an esti-
mate was submitted to Congress for a larger fireproof building to
serve essentially the same purpose, fronting on B street south, between
the National Museum and the Army Medical Museum, appropriate in
appearance to the former building. It was designed to be 130 feet
long by 50 feet wide, and intended to be used for both workshops and
storage purposes, thus replacing all of the temporary buildings then
in use. It failed to receive favorable action, however. The wording
of the item was as follows:

For the erection of a fireproof building for workshop and storage purposes for the
National Museum, said building to be constructed under the direction of the Super-
intendent of the Library of Congress in accordance with the approval of the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, $50,000.

TEMPORARY AND RENTED BUILDINGS.

The crowded conditions in the Smithsonian and Museum buildings
have necessitated the erection from time to time of small frame strue-
tures on the Smithsonian and Armory squares, and the renting of build-
ings south of B street south, for the requirements either of workshops
and storage, or of the preparation of exhibits for expositions. The
use of the Armory building and the erection of a brick laboratory have
already been referred to.

In 1882 a shed was built to the westward of the Armory building, a
part of which was used for the shelter of Fish Commission cars, and
the remainder filled with the collections received from the permanent
exhibition building in Philadelphia. A second shed was subsequently
added for the purposes of the National Museum, but only one of these
now remains and is utilized by the Museum.

The large amount of work incident to the preparation of collections
for the exhibitions at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans made it
necessary to put up a special frame building, which was done at the
expense of the exposition fund during the summer of 1884. It meas-

a a,

ured about 100 by 50 feet, and was located along B Street south, a
short distance to the east of the Museum building. It was also made
to serve for the temporary storage of the material brought back from
those exhibitions. Some small additions were made and a loft con-
structed. It remained in use until 1887, when it was torn down and
the materials of its construction were utilized elsewhere. During
more or less of the period of its existence it furnished accommodations
to the taxidermists, and osteologists, and to other preparators, includ-
ing those of the Bureau of Ethnology. In it were also stored large
quantities of specimens, especially geological and ethnological.

In 1887 two low sheds were built along the south side of and close
to the Smithsonian building, one on each side of the south tower, and
extending nearly the entire length of each fagade. They were con-
structed largely of material from the building last above mentioned,
and were both unsightly and dangerous in their proximity to the
Smithsonian building. The west shed was at first cut up into
seven workshops and storage compartments. The east shed was, for
a time, given over to living animals, but when these were removed to
the Zoological Park it was used for the storage of cases and supplies.
Both sheds were more or less employed in the preparations for the
World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago. Their removal was
effected in 1898, under the provisions of an act of Congress giving
$2,500 for the purpose. The material derived from them was used
partly in building a shed at the Ninth street annex, referred to below,
and partly in the erection of the so-called south shed on the Mall
directly south of the south tower of the Smithsonian building.

The National Zoological Park grew out of a small assemblage of
living animals gathered at the National Museum. The first part of
this collection was received from the West in 1887 and was installed
in one end of the eastern of the two sheds along the south side of the
Smithsonian. Additional specimens obtained in the early part of
1888 made it necessary to utilize the entire building for this purpose.
Later in the year yards were constructed in the grounds south of the
Smithsonian building for buffalo and deer, and several small buildings
were also erected. During 1891 the living animals were transferred
to the park, and the inclosures and buildings which they had occupied
were all removed except the eastern shed and one small shed farther
out on the grounds which was modified into a paint shop.

In the winter of 1889-90 the first of the frame buildings now con-
stituting the Astrophysical Observatory was erected south of the
eastern end of the Smithsonian building. It was subsequently slightly
enlarged, and three other smaller structures were added in 1893 and
1898. The fence inclosing this cluster of buildings has recently been
enlarged to afford some open-air space for experimental purposes, the
extent of the area now covered being about 176 by 78 feet.
262 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

In 1898 a frame building of two stories, called the ‘‘ south shed,” was
built on the grounds south of the south tower of the Smithsonian
building, being separated from it by the roadway and a strip of lawn.
It is about 53 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 23 feet high tothe eaves. It
contains the taxidermists’ laboratories for mammals and various work-
shops.

The only structures now standing on the Mall near the Smithsonian
and Museum buildings are the laboratory and stable building, the south
shed, and the buildings of the Astrophysical Observatory. This clear-
ing of the grounds, however, has only been rendered possible through
the appropriation of funds by Congress for the renting of outside
buildings, chiefly south of B street south, and not far distant from the
Museum, as follows:

Louisiana avenue near Tenth street NW., from March 15, 1894, to
June 30, 1895, a period of fifteenth months and sixteen days, at $75 a
month.

A part of the old Belt Line street-car stable, corner of B and Third
streets SW., from July 1, 1895, to March 31, 1896, nine months, at
$75 a month.

No. 431 Ninth street SW., from April 1 to June 30, 1896, three
months, at $75 a month; from July 1, 1896, to date, at $166.66 a month,
the increase being due to extensive improvements in buildings.

No. 217 Seventh street SW., August, 1898, at $90 a month; Septem-
ber 1, 1898, to June 30, 1899, ten months, at $120 a month; July 1,
1899, to date, at $90 a month.

No. 313 Tenth street SW., August 1, 1898, to June 30, 1901, thirty-
five months, at $50 a month; July 1, 1901, to date, at $80 a month.
The increased rental in this case was due to the erection of an addition
to the original building.

Rear of No. 915 Virginia avenue SW., August 1, 1898, to June 30,
1899, eleven months, at $50 a month; July 1, 1899, to date, at $30 a
month.

The total amounts paid annually for rental of the above buildings
were, therefore, as follows:

HISTORY.

In his report for 1882 Secretary Baird discussed the inadequacy of
the Museum building, then scarcely more than a year old, to house the
rapidly increasing national collections or to provide for the Museum’s
own activities and those of the Geological Survey, the latter at that
time being partly carried on under the same roof. It was proposed
that a third building be erected on the southwest corner of the Smith-
sonian reservation for the geological and mineralogical divisions of the
Museum and for the accommodation of the Geological Survey.  Sec-
retary Baird’s remarks on this subject were as follows:

Large and capacious as is the new Museum building, it has proved already inade-
quate to the existing requirements of the National Museum. This building was
designed primarily to accommodate the vast number of industrial and economical
exhibits presented to the United States by foreign governments at the close of the
Philadelphia Exposition of 1876. A special appropriation was made by Congress for
their transfer to Washington, and the armory building in the square between Sixth
and Seventh streets was assigned for their reception. It required nearly sixty large-
sized freight cars to transport the mass.

Before the building was completed in 1881 and available for its purposes, almost
equally enormous additions had been made to the collections of the various Govern-
ment expeditions and of the Ethnological Bureau, which, together with many thou-
sands of objects previously in charge of the Smithsonian Institution, but for which
there was no room in the old building, constituted a much larger mass than was
264 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUESUM, 1903.

originally estimated. It is well known that at the close of the Centennial Exposi-
tion a company was organized to take charge of a large portion of the collections
exhibited on that occasion, and with these and such additional articles as might
be obtained to establish what was known as the ‘‘ Permanent Exhibition ”’ in the
main Centennial building, which covers nearly 18 acres. This organization, after
struggling for existence for several years, finally became unable to continue the effort
and the collections in its charge were speedily scattered. Many of these had been
presented to the National Museum with the understanding that they were to be left
with the Permanent Exhibition Company for a period of at least a few years. Others,
however, including many of the most valuable series, were obtained for the National
Museum through the efforts of Mr. Thomas Donaldson. All these collections were
carefully packed under his charge and stored in a building erected by him adjacent
to the Centennial building.

An appropriation was made by Congress to meet the cost of packing, shipping to
Washington, and storing the collections in question. About twenty cars were
required to transport them. They are now contained in a wooden building adjacent
to the armory, there being absolutely no space for them in the National Museum.

In addition to this a cabinet of at least double the magnitude, made by the Insti-
tute of Mining Engineers and deposited with the Pennsylvania Art Museum of Phil-
adelphia, has been offered to the Government simply on the condition of transfer to
Washington and proper exhibition. This is an extremely important collection, illu-
strating the mining resources and metallurgy of the United States and foreign coun-
tries, and will constitute a most important addition to the means of instruction at the
command of the Government. An appropriation will be asked, and it is hoped
obtained, for the purpose of transferring the collection to Washington; but some
measures must be taken for its ultimate display.

An even greater mass of additional material to be provided for will ‘be found in the
industrial collections of the United States census of 1880, and in the collections of the
U. 8. Geological Survey. The census collections embrace more particularly the
building stones of the country, the ores (especially of the precious metals), the com-
bustibles, such as coal, petroleum, etc., and the forest timber.

All these collections are of great magnitude, representing as nearly as possible a
full series from all parts of the country. They are carefully labeled and recorded,
and will be accompanied by full descriptions.

The building-stone collection is especially valuable, consisting, as it does, of many
thousands of samples of marble, granite, sandstone, and other substances, for the
most part dressed in 4-inch cubes, each of the faces showing a different surface and
treatment.

It is not believed that any established quarry remains unrepresented in this series,
while many extremely valuable deposits of ornamental and building stones are pre-
sented therein for the first time. Preparations are in progress for testing the strength,
resistance to torsion and crushing force, and economical properties of all these sam-
ples. The collection is now so far advanced that when a public building is to be
erected either by the States or the General Government it will be possible to show
specimens of all the best building stones in the vicinity of the locality involved, and
to present all the necessary data as to availability, durability, cost of production, ete.
Much use has already been made of the collection by the commissioners of State cap-
itals, county court-houses, etc., as well as by agents of the General Government.

The collection of ores made by the census agencies is also very extensive, that of
iron being particularly large. Nearly every iron mine of any prominence in the
United States has been visited and samples carefully selected by experts. These
have been analyzed under the direction of Professor Pumpelly, and reports presented
as to their chemical and metallurgical properties and economical value. All the
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 265

originals of this research are in charge of the Smithsonian Institution awaiting exhi-
bition. The same may be said of similar researches in regard to the ores of all the
other metals.

The work of the U.S. Geological Survey, also of enormous magnitude—begun
under Mr. Clarence King and continued under Maj. J. W. Powell—has resulted in
the accumulation of several tons of specimens of fossils, rocks, minerals, ores, and
the like. Very few of these can at present be exhibited for want of the necessary
space. The survey requires a large number of experts and assistants, and is at pres-
ent very badly accommodated. .Some twenty rooms in the new Museum building
have been assigned as quarters for the Director of the Survey and his assistants.

This, however, causes great inconvenience to the other work of the Museum, and
as the survey now occupies a large building in Washington, for which it pays con-
siderable rental, and for want of quarters in Washington is obliged to scatter its
stations over various parts of the United States, it is thought desirable to ask Con-
gress for an appropriation to erect a second museum building corresponding in general
character to the first, but on the opposite side of the square, along the line of Twelith
street.

This building it is proposed to devote almost entirely to the mineral department
of the National Museum; and when completed to transfer to it everything of a geolog-
ical and mineralogical nature, and also to prepare a portion of it especially for the
accommodation of the Geological Survey, which is at present so inconyeniently pro-
vided for. By way of economy it is proposed at first to construct what will repre-
sent the western side of the building, in which office rooms and chemical and other
laboratories can be provided for.

It had been proposed to erect a separate building for the Geological Survey, dis-
eonnected from the National Museum; but there being no ground available for this
purpose, it was thought expedient to ask for an appropriation to furnish the required
quarters on the Smithsonian reservation, which is at present ample for the purpose.

On the 10th of April last the following bill was accordingly introduced into the
House of Representatives and referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds. The subject is still before that committee, and it is impossible to state
what will be its fate during the present session. I would recommend action on the
part of the Board of Regents in this connection, since long before the edifice can be
completed the need for it will become extremely urgent.

“A BILL (H. R. No. 5781)for the erection of a fireproof building on the south portion of the Smith-
sonian reservation, for the accommodation of the United States Geological Survey, and for other
purposes.

‘“« Be it enacted, &c., That the sum of two hundred thousand dollars be, and hereby
is, appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for
the erection of a fireproof building on the south portion of the Smithsonian reserva-
tion for the accommodation of the United States Geological Survey, and for other
purposes: Provided, That the consent of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
be first obtained thereto, and that the building be under their direction when com-
pleted: And provided further, That the building be erected by the Architect of the
Capitol, in accordance with plans approved by the Director of the United States
Geological Survey, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and the Architect
of the Capitol acting as a board therefor.”’

At the annual meeting of the Board of Regents on January 17,
1883, Secretary Baird presented the report from which the above
extract is taken, called attention to House bill 5781, introduced in
April, 1882, and urged the necessity for speedy action in relation to
266 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

an additional building for the use of the Museum and the Geological
Survey, whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution recommend to
Congress to enlarge the National Museum, so as properly to exhibit the mineral,
geological, and other collections already on hand and increasing each year, by the
erection of a fireproof building on the southwest corner of the Smithsonian reserva-
tion, similar in style to the present N tional Museum; and they request an appro-
priation of $300,000 therefor, to be expended under the direction of the Regents of
the Institution.

It was also resolved—

That the chancellor, General Sherman, and the Secretary be, and they are hereby,
authorized and empowered to act fo and in the name of the Board of Regents in
carrying into effect the provisions of any act of Congress which may be passed pro-
viding for the erection of an additional building for the Nat'onal Museum.

Further strong reasons for the erection of an additional building
were given in the report of Secretary Baird for 1883, in which he
Says:

No better illustration can be had of the increase in the collections of the National
Museum than the fact that an additional building is urgently required for their
proper accommodation, as explained in the last report (1882).

In 1875 the collections then in charge of the Smithsonian Institution were comfort-
ably accommodated within the limits of the Smithsonian building, in rooms having
an aggregate area of 30,000 square feet. They consisted principally of specimens of
natural history and ethnology; confined almost entirely to North America, with the
exception of objects of Polynesian manufacture, forming part of the Wilkes collec-
tion.

In 1875 an appropriation was made by Congress to enable the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and the Fish Commission to prepare an exhibit of objects illustrating the
resources of the United States, as derived from the animal and mineral kingdoms,
and, with the assistance of a special appropriation to the Indian Bureau, of a collec-
tion of North American anthropology. A large sum of money was expended in the
preparation of this exhibit, which was forwarded to Philadelphia in 1876, and con-
stituted a part of the Government display which attracted much attention.

At the close of the Philadelphia exhibition very large donations were made to the
United States by foreign countries, including both the official commissioners and
individual exhibitors. Many objects of much interest were contributed on the same
occasion from American displays. These collections, filling some fifty freight cars,
were brought to Washington and were stored for a time in the Armory Building,
assigned by Congress for their reception.

After several fruitless efforts, an appropriation of $250,000 was obtained for the
purpose of putting up an inexpensive edifice for the storage of these articles, and
their transfer was begun in the autumn of 1881, but little more than two years ago.

Since then large numbers of collections of very great importance have come to
hand, chief among them being the gatherings of the U. 8. Geological Survey and of
the Ethnological Bureau, made on a scale of unexampled magnitude and well
befitting the operations of a nation like the United States. The many scientific
explorations, made either separately by the Smithsonian Institution or conjointly
with the United States Signal Service or other bureaus or bodies, the work of the
Fish Commission, and the enormous aggregate of many smaller collections, have
tended largely to increase the material to be provided for.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 267

Tn addition to this, the exhibition by the United States at London of illustrations
of its fisheries (the freight bulk of which amounted to not less than 24,000 cubic feet,
and consisting, in very large part, of new objects and articles obtained at the
expense of the appropriations of Congress for that purpose) must also be provided
for; as also the very valuable and extensive collections in mineralogy, geology, and
metallurgy made by the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and presented to
the United States, but stored in Philadelphia awaiting an appropriation for its
transfer.

It may be stated in brief, therefore, that, at the present time, the vast building,
finished scarcely more than two years ago, is now filled to overflowing; while there
is additional material enough on hand belonging to the Government to occupy fully
half of a second building of the same size, and with a probability that the entire
space will be required before the construction can be accomplished, even supposing
that it is begun at the earliest possible time.

The Smithsonian Institution has always acted in hearty cooperation with the affili-
ated scientific branches of the Government even where no official relationship
existed, this being notably the case in ‘regard to the U. S. Geological Survey. This
important Bureau, in the rapid increase of its work, has been greatly hampered by
want of the necessary accommodations; and it was with much gratification that the
Institution proffered a share of the new building to the Director, Major Powell, for
the accommodation of his collections, and for the office and laboratory work. It
was, however, unable to do as much as was desirable, owing to the inadequacy of
quarters for the purpose.

Should an appropriation be made for the new building, for which the Board
authorized application to Congress, it is intended to share it with the Geological Sur-
vey so that it may have all the facilities required for its important work.

It will be remembered that Congress in the act of 1846 set aside for the use of the
Smithsonian Institution 20 acres in the southwest corner of the square bounded by
Seventh and Twelfth streets and north and south B streets, the center of the Smith-
sonian building being exactly in the middle of the square. It was in the southeast
quarter of this reservation that the new Museum building was erected, forming a
very unsymmetrical annex to the original Smithsonian building. It is now proposed
to take the southwest corner of the reservation for the new edifice, which, when
completed, will be essentially of the general character of the present Museum build-
ng, and will restore the proper architectural balance.

Congress has now been asked to make an appropriation for one wing of this new
building to be specially fitted for the use of the officers and laboratories of the
National Museum and of the Geological Survey; and, if the amount can be obtained
at the present session, occupation of the building can be assured within eighteen
months from the commencement of operations. The vacating of the rooms now
occupied by the Geological Survey will also furnish much-needed accommodation to
the Museum; possibly enough until the remainder of the building can be provided
for. The proposed wing, however, will be complete in itself, architecturally, and
will not involve any addition for its proper harmonious effect.

The following estimate, based upon the recommendation to Congress
above referred to, was submitted in 1883 for consideration with the
appropriation bills for 1885, but failed to be reported to either House:

Construction, in a fireproof manner, of an additional museum building, to receive
the collections and laboratories in chemistry, geology, mineralogy, metallurgy, taxi-
dermy, ete.; and for the offices and laboratories of the U. 8. Geological Survey,
to be erected under the direction and supervision of the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, on the southwest corner of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution,

$200,000.
2OSa% REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

From 1882 until the present time the necessity for a new building
has never ceased to be the subject of greater or less attention by the
Regents and the Secretary. In 1885, after noting the previous steps
taken, Professor Baird remarked:

The need isnow much greater than before, as there is enough material in the way
of valuable specimens of economical interest to fill a second building the size of the
present one. This unexhibited surplus is now stored in several buildings, some in
Washington and some elsewhere, and consists of important illustrations of the econom-
ical geology, metallurgy, and other resources of the United States. In addition to
what has been on hand for some time, very large collections were presented to the
Government at the New Orleans exhibition, which embraced a great deal of intrinsic
value as well as of popular and scientific interest. It is earnestly to be hoped that
this requirement will be met by Congress by the speedy appropriation of an amount
suitable for the purpose.

In 1886 Secretary Baird stated that as special provision was desired
for laboratories and offices, and to give suitable quarters to the U.S,
Geological Survey and the Bureau of Ethnology, an estimate had been
made of the sum of $250,000 for the purpose of constructing one wing
and pavilion of the new building, leaving the remainder to be con-
structed hereafter, should Congress so approve it, at a cost of, per-
haps, an additional $250,000. This estimate, submitted in 1886 for
the sundry civil bill for 1888, varied but slightly in wording from the
estimate of 1883. It received no consideration by Congress and was
as follows:

For commencing the construction, in a fireproof manner, of an additional museum
building to receive the collections and laboratories in chemistry, geology, mineralogy,
metallurgy, taxidermy, etc., and for offices and laboratories of the U. 8. Geological
Survey, to be erected under the direction and supervision of the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution on the southwest section of the grounds of the Smithsonian
Institution, $250,000.

The following extract is from the Museum report of the same year,
by Doctor Goode:

The National Museum is now approaching an important crisis in its history. Its
future will depend upon the action of Congress in granting it an additional building,
for without more room its growth can not but be in large degree arrested. From
this time forward it will be impossible to develop the collections satisfactorily with-
out additional space. The laboratories and workshops are already entirely inade-
quate for the storage of the unexhibited collections and the accommodation of the
preparators and mechanics, and the exhibition halls do not afford suitable oppor-
tunity for the display of the materials already in order for public examination.

At the annual meeting of the Board of Regents on January 11, 1888,
the first held after the appointment of the present Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Langley brought to the attention of the
Regents the necessity of continuing the efforts toward securing an
additional museum building, and spoke of the legislation previously
proposed. The Board renewed its recommendation to Congress of
January 17, 1888, and discussed the matter of providing quarters for
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 969

the Geological Survey in the new building, pursuant to the wording
of House bill No. 5781, presented to Congress in 1881, and of the
several estimates subsequently submitted. The chancellor stated as
his opinion—

That it was desirable that new museum buildings should be erected in any case,
but that since by act of Congress a certain part of the public grounds had been set
apart and appropriated absolutely and exclusively to the Smithsonian Institution,
he for one did not want to see anything else placed on these grounds.

He further said:

If the Smithsonian Institution is to grow, it will need them all, and whatever is put
upon them should be under our exclusive control.

The following extract from the report of Secretary Langley for
1888 has reference to this subject:

Among other matters discussed at the last meeting of the Regents was the erection
of anew Museum building. On this occasion the Regents tacitly reaffirmed their
resolution of 1883, recommending to Congress the enlargement of the National
Museum by the erection of a fireproof building on the southwest corner of the
Smithsonian reservation, similar in style to the present National Museum; but on
viewing the sketch plans, which had been prepared subsequently to the resolution,
so as to include offices for the Geological Survey, they added an expression of their
opinion that the new building should be planned exclusively for Museum purposes.

It was not at first intended to take action in this matter during the present year,
but the overcrowded condition of the building, on account of which not only the
current work but the proper development of the collections is greatly impeded,
seemed to render immediate action necessary. A still more urgent need appeared to
be the unsatisfactory sanitary condition of the new Museum building. A commit-
tee, consisting of Dr. J. H. Kidder, chairman, Dr. James M. Flint, U. 8S. Navy, and
Mr. J. E. Watkins, was appointed on April 14, to make a careful study of the water
supply, ventilation, and drainage, and in May submitted a preliminary report, from
which it appeared that an alarming amount of sicknessand mortality has been mani-
fest among the employes since 1881—a mortality which can not be attributed to the
location of the building, which has sometimes been pronounced unsanitary, since
there has been no corresponding percentage of ill health in the old Smithsonian
building adjoining. The number of days lost by employees on account of sickness in
1886 was 796; in 1887, 875; and in 1888, up to May 10, 213, by far the largest part of
this loss of time being attributed on the books of the Museum to miasmatic diseases.
The committee states that there is no reasonable doubt that some, if not all, of the
ten deaths since 1881 were hastened or induced by the unwholesome condition of this
building. The committee suggested repairs and modifications of considerable extent,
including the construction of continuous cellars under each of the four sides of the
building, which, in addition to the other necessary expenses, would cost in the neigh-
borhood of $40,000. This state of affairs seemed to demand decided action, and it
being absolutely impossible to make any changes in the present building without
entirely vacating a portion of it for a considerable period of time, the exigency for
more accommodation seemed a great deal more urgent than had been at first
supposed.

While it became evident, on study of the question, that for the ultimate needs of
the Museum, a building of but one story, occupying the same area as the present
Museum, would be insufficient, the question of immediate action was unexpectedly
brought up in May by one of the senior Regents, a member of the Senate, who, when
co

270 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

visiting the Museum with some friends, noticed its crowded and unsatisfactory con-
dition. Having learned from me of the mortality and sickness of the employees, he
inquired as to the feasibility of erecting a new building, and offered to use his influ-
ence to procure an appropriation, if 1 could obtain for him a set of sketch plans
within a week, time being, as he stated, a very essential condition. After consulting
with the chairman of your executive committee, I had no hesitation in accepting
such an offer, but a difficulty arose from the fact that the sketch plans which had
been laid before the Regents in 1882 were in part for purposes which the Regents had
at their last meeting disapproved, and that hence they could not be used. By great
diligence, however, plans for a building to be devoted exclusively to Museum pur-
poses were prepared within the time mentioned. These were based upon an exten-
sive accumulation of notes and drawings, embodying the record of the best recent
work of museum construction in this country and in Europe, and they were fora
building, as faras was consistent with these improvements, like the existing Museum.
The report submitted by Senator Morrill, to accompany Senate bill 3134, contains
the correspondence on which action was taken, and I have discussed the acts therein
presented elsewhere under the proper heads.

The following bill was introduced by Senator Morrill on June 12, was passed by
the Senate on June 20, and at the end of the fiscal year was in the hands of the
House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds:

“A BILL forthe erection of an additional fireproof building for the use of the National Museum.

“* Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, That the sum of five hundred thousand dollars is hereby
appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, or so
much thereof as may be necessary, for the erection of a fireproof building for the use
of the National Museum, to cover three hundred feet square, and to consist of two
stories and basement, to be erected under the direction of the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, in accordance with the plans now on file with the Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds of the Senate, on the southwestern portion of the
grounds of the Smithsonian Institution. Said building to be placed west of the
Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway between it and the latter of not less
than forty feet, with the north front on a line with the south face of the building of
the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian Institution; and all expendi-
tures for the purpose herein mentioned shall be audited by the proper officers of the
Treasury Department.’’

The building, as proposed, covers the same area as the present Museum, and is of
the same general style, so faras is consistent with the introduction of a second story,
thus affording nearly three times as much accommodation under the same area of
roof as the building now in use. The arrangement of the interior of the proposed
new structure is, however, considerably modified, as the result of the experience of
seven years’ occupation of the present building. The eighteen exhibition halls on
the two main floors are completely isolated from each other, and are capable of sub-
division into smaller halls. The lighting will be equally as good as in the present
building, the ventilation will be much better, and in other important respects the
sanitary arrangements will be far more satisfactory.

A basement story is absolutely necessary, not only with a view to promoting the
comfort and health of visitors and employees, as well as for securing greater dryness
and better preservation of the specimens, but also for the purpose of providing large
apartments for storerooms and workshops. These proposed improvements in
arrangement will not, however, interfere with the possibility of constructing a build-
ing which shall conform in the essential points of exterior proportion with the main
features of the present building.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. rt

The present building contains about 80,000 square feet of floor space available for
exhibition and storage. The building proposed will contain about 220,000 square
feet. The amount of room for offices and laboratories would be about the same in
each. The net area in the new building available for exhibition, storage, and office
rooms, as estimated, would be between five and six acres.

For the construction of the present Museum building an appropriation of $250,000
was made. This sum was supplemented by the following special appropriations:
$25,000 for steam-heating apparatus, $26,000 for marble floors, $12,500 for water and
gas fixtures and electrical apparatus, and $1,900 for special sewer connections. The
total amount expended on this building was therefore $315,400, and it is generally
admitted that the cost of its construction was considerably less than that of any
other similar building in existence; in fact, perhaps too cheap to secure the truest
economy.

The proposed structure can be erected at a proportionately smaller cost. I have
obtained from responsible bidders, who are willing to give bonds for the completion
of the work in accordance with the bids which they have submitted, estimates for
the erection of the building complete, with steam-heating apparatus and all other
essential appliances, excepting the electrical equipment, amounting in the aggregate
to $473,000. These bids, upon which the estimates of cost have been made, were
not competitive, and it is possible that something may be saved through competi-
tion. It is, however, necessary to provide also for the architect’s superintendence,
and for the removal and reconstruction of the Smithsonian stable, which now oecu-
pies the site. I therefore think it advisable to make request for the sum of $500,000,
in order that these additional items and other contingencies may be covered.

The plans, though drawn in the limited time imposed, represent the results of an
exhaustive study—which has extended over several years—of plans of the best
modern museum buildings in Europe and America, nearly all of which have been
personally inspected by officers of the Smithsonian Institution.

Senate bill No. 3134, above quoted, when presented to the Senate
on June 12, 1888, was accompanied by a favorable report from the
Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds (No. 1539), and
contained two letters from Secretary Langley, dated June 2 and 8,
1888. The former referred mainly to the plans for the proposed
building, the latter to the collections and needs of the Museum. On
June 21, an effort was made to have this bill attached to the sundry
civil bill, an amendment to that effect being proposed by Senator
Morrill, but no progress was gained by this action, and the bill went
over to the next session.

On January 17, 1889, Senator Morrill again submitted the measure
as an amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1890, and it was referred
to the Committee on Appropriations, but no action was taken. In his
report for the same year Secretary Langley shows the increased
necessity for additional space, in that Congress at its previous session
had granted the Armory building to the Fish Commission as its head-
quarters, requiring the Museum to remove therefrom all but a few of
its preparator’s workrooms.

On December 10, 1888, and December 19, 1889, bills were intro-
duced in both houses of Congress for the erection of a fireproof
building for the U.S. Geological Survey independently of the National
272 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Museum, on the south side of the Mall between the Museum building
and that of the Army Medical Museum, the amount requested for the
purpose varying in the several bills and amendments thereto from
$300,000 to $800,000. Both of these measures failed to pass. The
report of the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds,
submitted February 16, 1889, contains a letter from the Director of
the Survey, from which the following extracts, interesting in this
connection, are taken:

In addition to the rooms in the rented [Hooe] building, through the courtesy of
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution the Survey is permitted to use twenty-
two rooms in the National Museum, and these are all crowded in such manner that
work is seriously obstructed. The rooms in the National Museum were temporarily
given to the Survey at a time when there was no pressing necessity for their use by
the officers of the Museum; but at the present time the entire Museum is so crowded
that the Secretary of the Smithsonian and the Director of the Museum are anxious
to have these rooms surrendered for their use. * * *

The building planned does not provide for museum space. The statutes now pro-
vide that the collections of the Geological Survey, when no longer needed for
investigations in progress, shall be deposited in the National Museum. The plan
contemplated in the bill before your committee provides that the building for the
Geological Survey shall be near to the National Museum—between that building and
the Army Medical Museum building. Such an arrangement of buildings will be
highly advantageous to the Survey, as the offices of the Survey would be adjacent.
to the National Museum, and the materials stored in the Museum building would be
accessible for reference and comparison, as constantly needed.

In his annual report for 1890, Assistant Secretary George Brown
Goode, in charge of the Museum, made the following statements
regarding the necessity for a new building:

The necessity for additional room is constantly increasing, and several of the col-
lections, to wit, transportation and engineering, fishes, reptiles, birds’ eggs, mol-
lusks, insects, marine invertebrates, vertebrate and invertebrate fossils, fossil and
recent plants, are in some instances wholly unprovided for, and in others only in a
very inadequate degree.

In the main hall of the Smithsonian building is still exhibited the collection of
birds. A few cases containing birds’ eggs and shells have recently been arranged
along the center of this hall.

Eleven of the departments in the National Museum have no space assigned to
them in the Museum building, solely on account of its crowded condition. The col-
lection of prehistoric anthropological objects remains installed on the second floor
of the Smithsonian building. The collections of the remaining ten departments
can not be exhibited or even properly arranged and classified without more room.
These collections are at present stored in the attics and basements of the Smithso-
nian and Armory buildings, and are inaccessible for study and for the other purposes
for which they were obtained. The specimens comprising these collections are not
simply objects of natural history, possessing an abstract interest to the student, but
represent the application of natural objects to the industries, and, as such, are of
great importance. There are several collections of ores, minerals, building stones,
and of objects representing various arts and industries, which are of very great value,

mable importance.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 273

The increase in the national collections during the last eight years may perhaps
be best described by the statement that in 1882 the total number of specimens
recorded in the Museum was about 183,000; while in 1890 the records indicated the
possession of nearly 3,000,000 specimens. It is proper to say in this connection that
the actual increase was not so great as shown by the records, since during this period
a large amount of material previously received had been brought under control and
placed on the books of the Museum. It should also be borne in mind that the pres-
ent Museum building was planned with reference to the reception of the material in
its custody at the time of its construction.

During the Fifty-first Congress the question of a new building was
frequently under discussion, but without result. On February 19,
1890, Senator Morrill, from the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, reported Senate bill No. 2740, which provided:

That for an additional fireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300
feet square, with two stories and a basement, to be erected under the direction of
the Architect of the Capitol, with the approval of the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, in accordance with plans now on file with the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, on the southwestern portion of the grounds of the Smith-
sonian Institution, there shall be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury
not otherwise appropriated, the sum of $500,000; said building to be placed west of
the Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway between it and the latter of not less
than 50 feet, with its north front on a line with the south face of the Agricultural
Department and of the Smithsonian Institution, and constructed as far as practicable,
after proper advertisement, by contract or contracts awarded to the lowest responsi-
ble bidder, and all expenditures for the purposes herein mentioned shall be audited
by the proper officers of the Treasury Department.

On April, 9, 1890, the same bill was submitted to the House and
referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. These
bills were again brought up in the second session of the same Congress,
in the House on January 9, 1891 (where it was committed to the Com-
mittee of the Whole), and in the Senate on February 9, 1891, as an
amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1892. The House bill, differ-
ing somewhat in wording from the Senate bill, was as follows:

That for an additional fireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300
feet square, with two stories and a basement, to be erected by the Supervising Archi-
tect of the Treasury, under the direction of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, in general accordance with plans now on file with the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, on the southwestern portion of the grounds of the Smithso-
nian Institution, there shall be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated, the sum of $500,000; said building to be placed west of the
Smithsonian Institution, with its north front on a line with the north front of the
present Museum building, and constructed as far as practicable, after proper adver-
tisement, by contract or contracts awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, and all
expenditures for the purposes herein mentioned shall be audited by the proper
officers of the Treasury Department.

Letters in support of the measure were transmitted to Congress by
Secretary Langley, and some arguments were presented on the floor.

NAT Mus 1903
974 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The report to the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds
by Secretary Langley, dated January 21, 1890, was mainly as follows:

I send you herewith a set of sketch plans intended to show, in a general way, the
extent aud character of a building such as would seem to be necessary for the accom-
modation of the Museum collections in the present and immediate future, and respect-
fully request for them your attention and a recommendation to Congress of the
necessary means for such a building.

These plans and sketches are provisional, but although not presented in detail they
represent the results of studies, extending over many years, of the plans of the best
modern museum buildings in Europe and America, nearly all of which have been
inspected by officers of the Smithsonian Institution.

The proposed building covers the same area as that finished in 1881. It is intended
to consist of two stories and a basement, except in the central portion, which consists
of one lofty hall open from the main floor to the roof, the height of which will be
90 feet, galleries being placed on the level of the second floor in other parts of the
building. Its interior arrangements are, as you will see, different from those in the
actual Museum, all the changes having been planned in the light of the experience
of nine years’ occupation of the present building. It will afford between two and
three times as much available space for exhibition and storage under the same area
of roof. The fifteen exhibition halls are completely isolated from each other, and
may readily be subdivided, when necessary, into smaller rooms. The light will be
as good as in the old building, and the ventilation perhaps still better. The sanitary
arrangements have been carefully considered.

The necessity for a basement is especially great. In this, place has been provided
for many storage rooms and workshops. The existence of a basement will promote
the comfort and health of visitors and employees, and by increasing the dryness of
the air in the exhibition halls will secure the better preservation of the collections.
These proposed changes in the internal arrangements will not interfere with con-
formity with the other points of the present Museum building in the essential
features of exterior proportion. The total capacity of this present building in avail-
able floor space is about 100,000 square feet; that of the new building somewhat
exceeds 200,000. The present Museum building contains about 80,000 feet of floor
space available for exhibition. That proposed will contain about 103,300 square feet
for exhibition. The space devoted to offices and laboratories would not be much
more, but the area available for exhibition halls, storage rooms, and workshops far
greater. The appropriation for the construction of the present building was $250,000.

The estimates of cost on this building vary greatly with regard to details of con-
struction on which I do not here enter further than to say that the whole should be
absolutely fireproof throughout, and in view of the further great variation of the
cost of building materials within the past two years, I am not prepared to state the
sum which would be necessary for its completion. It is certain, however, that
$500,000, if not sufficient to complete it, would be all that would be required to be
expended during the present year, and I would respectfully represent the desirability
of an appropriation of this amount for the purpose in question.

Your attention is directed to certain facts in regard to the character of the mate-
rials for the accommodation of which this building is desired. The collections of
the Smithsonian Institution and of the Government are especially rich in collections
of natural history, which may be grouped in three general classes: The zoological
collections, the botanical collections, and the geological collections, including not
only all the geological and mineralogical material, but the greater portion of that
belonging to paleontology, the study of fossil animals and plants forming an essential
part of modern geological work.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 275

Besides the natural history collections, there are equally important anthropological
collections which illustrate the history of mankind at all periods and in every land,
and which serve to explain the development of all human arts and industries. In
everything that relates to the primitive inhabitants of North America, Eskimo as
well as Indian, these collections are by far the richest in the world, and with the
necessary amount of exhibition space the material on hand will be arranged in a
manner which will produce the most impressive and magnificent effect, the educa-
tional importance of which can not be overestimated. Again there are collections
of considerable extent which illustrate the processes and products of the various arts
and industries, as well as what are termed the historical collections, which are of
especial interest to a very large number of the visitors to the Museum on account of
the associations of the objects exhibited with the personal history of representative
men or with important events in the history of America.

The collections illustrating the arts and the art industries are relatively small, and
although in themselves of great interest and value, not to be compared in importance
with those in natural history and ethnology.

In a letter addressed on June 7, 1888, to the Hon. Justin 8. Morrill, and which
will be found in a report of June 12 of the same year from the Senate Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds, I made a statement of the rapidity of the recent growth
of the Museum, mentioning that in the five years from 1882 to 1887 the number of speci-
mens in the collection have multiplied no less than sixteen times, and endeayored
to give an idea, though perhaps an inadequate one, of the extent to which the
pressure for want of space was felt. The evil has grown rapidly worse, and, as I
have had occasion to mention, it has been felt in the last year in a partial arrest of
the growth of the collections, which emphasizes the demand for more room. The
present Museum building is not large enough even for the natural history collections
alone, a number of which are without any exhibition space whatever. The proposed
building will afford accommodations for the ethnological and technological material
already on hand and fora large part of the natural history material also. The collee-
tions are still increasing, and the number of specimens, as estimated, is now not far
from 3,000,000. ‘

Unless more space is soon provided the development of the Government collec-
tions will of necessity be almost completely arrested.

So long as there was room for storage, collections not immediately required could
be received and packed away for future use. This can not longer be done.

The Armory building, since 1877 assigned to the Museum for storage and work-
shops, is now entirely occupied by the U. S. Fish Commission, with the exception
of four rooms, and by some of the Museum taxidermists, who are now working in
very contracted space, and whom it is impossible to accommodate elsewhere.

Increased space in the exhibition halls is needed, the educational value of the col-
lections being seriously diminished by the present crowded system of installation.
Still more necessary, however, is room for storage, for rearranging the great reserve
collections, for eliminating duplicate material for distribution to college and school
museums, and for the use of the taxidermists and preparators engaged in preparing
objects for exhibition. Space is also required for the proper handling of the costly
outfit of the museum cases and appliances for installation, of which there is always a
considerable amount temporarily out of use or in process of construction.

In summarizing what has just been said, it may be stated in general terms that the
amount of space already required for exhibition purposes alone, being 207,500 feet
as against 100,675 now occupied, and this being exclusive of the 108,900 square feet
needed for other objects, the accumulations have now reached such a point of con-
gestion that the actual space needs to be doubled, even independently of future
276 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

increase; and I beg to repeat that, unless more space is provided, the development
of the Government collection, which is already partly arrested, will be almost com-
pletely stopped.

The bill was passed by the Senate as a separate measure on April 5,
1890, and as an amendment to the sundry ciyil bill for 1891 on July
19. In the House no action was secured, though the bill was favor-
ably reported by the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds.

The question of placing a basement story under the existing Museum

building, which had been under consideration at this time and was’
referred to the Architect of the Capitol, was reported upon to the

House, under date of March 3, 1890, as follows:

ARCHITECT’S OFFICE, UNITED STATES CAPITOL,
Washington, D. C., February 28, 1890.

Sir: In compliance with the requirements of the act providing for the sundry civil
expenses of the Government, approved March 2, 1889, I have examined the National
Museum, and have estimated the cost of constructing the basement story under that
building.

It is thought that the only portion of the basement available for workshops and
suitable for storage would be a cellar running around the outer walls of the Ibuild-
ing and extending inwards 30 feet, so that the rooms thus obtained may have light
and air.

These rooms should be roofed with brick arches supported by iron beams. Pro-
vision is made in the accompanying estimate to floor with tiles the entire rooms
under which these basements come, in part, as the present wooden floors of these
rooms are now in bad condition and will soon be unfit for use.

I will say that by reason of the sewer,-steam, and gas pipes running under the
present floors the work of constructing these basement rooms, though practicable,
will be extremely difficult.

I beg to say that I am of the opinion that a site for a storehouse and for work-
shops required may be purchased in the neighborhood of the Museum and a fire-
proof building erected thereon with a capacity as great as these proposed basement
rooms for a sum less than will be necessary to construct this basement.

Very respectfully,
Epwarp CLARK,
Architect United States Capitol.
The SPEAKER OF THE Housk oF REPRESENTATIVES.
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 7

On January 28, 1891, in view of the possibility of the passage by
Congress of a bill for a new building, the Regents—

Resolved, That the executive committee of the Board of Regents, or a majority
thereof, and the Secretary be, and they are hereby, authorized and empowered to
act for and in the name of the Board of Regents in carrying into effect the provisions
of any act of Congress that may be passed providing for the erection of a new build-
ing for the United States National Museum.

In the Fifty-second Congress a bill identical with that submitted at
the beginning of the previous Congress passed the Senate on April 14,
1892, but in the House it went no further than the Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds. In the Fifty-third Congress the same
measure was again introduced, but failed of action.

In all the reports of the Secretary from 1892 down, attention was
valled to this ever-pressing subject. The exhibition space in both
buildings was overfilled. Small specimens could be crowded in here
and there, but extensive changes meant that old collections must be
sent to storage for the benefit of something more important or of a
better class of preparations. Extra storerooms and workrooms were
imperative, but they could only be provided by renting outside quar-
ters, with the full understanding that such structures were unsafe, and
that collections to the value of hundreds of thousands of dollars might
any day be destroyed through the merest accident. Year after year
the extent and value of the material thus unsafely housed has been
rapidly increasing, and the conditions prevailing have also influenced
disadvantageously many owners of valuable and rare specimens, the
donation or loan of which could easily have been effected were there a
safe place for their installation. It is known that the Museum has
been deprived of many large and important accessions from this cause
alone.

These circumstances have been explained time and again, but while
the arguments presented have excited much interest and have secured
the influence of strong and deyoted friends, they have never, until
within the past two years, obtained the recognition they merit.

The building of galleries in the Museum building, begun in 1897,
has afforded slight relief, but the total extent of these additions has
increased but little the former area of the two buildings, and in no
way lessened the need of a new one.

In the Fifty-fourth Congress Senator Morrill made his final effort
toward securing the appropriation so much desired by introducing in
the Senate, on December 10, 1895, bill No. 698, which differed but
slightly in wording from former measures, except that the cost was

~

reduced from $500,000 to $250,000. It was as follows:

That for an additional fireproof building for the use of the National Museum, 300
feet square, with two stories anda basement, to be erected under the direction of the
278 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Architect of the Capitol, with the approval of the Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, in harmony with the present National Museum building, on the southwestern
portion of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, there shall be appropriated,
out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sum of $250,000;
said building to be placed west of the Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway
between it and the latter of not less than 50 feet, with its north front ona line
with the south face of the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and constructed, as far as practicable, after proper advertisement, by contract
or contracts approved by the Secretary of the Treasury and awarded to the lowest
responsible bidder; and all expenditures for the purpose herein mentioned shall be
audited by the proper officers of the Treasury Department.

This bill was referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, but on February 27 following Senator Morrill reported an
amendment, which consisted in substituting for the ‘‘Architect of the
Capitol” the name of Bernard R. Green to have direction of the con-
struction. It was submitted by the committee on March 23, 1896,
with a report (No. 540), consisting of material supplied by Secretary
Langley and Assistant Secretary Goode. The following, by Mr.
Langley, is extracted from his report for 1895:

In my last annual statement I pointed out three conditions which are operating to
seriously retard the growth of the National Museum: First, the lack of space for the
installation of objects which should be placed on exhibition; second, the unsym-
metrical growth of the collection; and, third, the fact that the storage of collections
in the wooden sheds south of the Smithsonian building, as well as in the basement
of the building itself, is most undesirable and dangerous. The sum of $900, allowed
for 1896, will be necessarily expended in the rental of shop and storage room in
The actually dangerous wooden sheds must there-

fore remain occupied until a sum of money is provided which will enable me to
discontinue their use altogether by renting other quarters removed entirely from
proximity to the Smithsonian building.

The problem of even providing shelter of any kind for the vast amount of material
daily received from persons interested in the growth and work of the Museum still
remains unsolved. The Institution is placed in an embarrassing position. It has
been designated by law as the only depository of collections offered to or made
under the auspices of the Government, and can not, under the law, refuse to receive
them. The fact remains, however, that when accepted there is no suitable place in
which to store them, and no space in the Museum building to exhibit such of the
objects as should properly be shown to the public. As I have already pointed out,
there is probably no museum in the world in which so small a proportion of the
objects worthy of exhibition is visible to the public, or in which the objects exhibited
are crowded together so closely. It is now more true than ever that if another
museum building as large as the present one were provided it could be at once filled
with specimens already on hand.

Following are some of the more important parts of Mr. Goode’s
statement:

The Smithsonian Institution is the custodian of the National Museum, which is
the only lawful place of deposit of ‘all objects of art and of foreign and curious
research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical
specimens belonging to the United States.”?. The nucleus of the collections con-
sists of the specimens brought home by the Wilkes and other exploring expedi-
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 979

tions, but for many years the Museum was supported entirely at the expense of the
Smithsonian fund, and a considerable portion of the collections is the property of the
Institution.

Professor Huxley defines a museum as ‘‘a consultative library of objects.’? The
National Museum is such a consultative library, and it is a great deal more. It is an
agency for the instruction of the people of the whole country, and it keeps in mind

‘

the needs of persons whose lives are not occupied in the study of science, as well as
those of the professional investigator and teacher.

Its benefits are extended without cost or reserve to hundreds of thousands of
visitors from all parts of the United States who pass through its doors each year.

It is also accessory to public education through the distribution of the duplicate
specimens in the Museum, which are made up into sets, accurately named, and
given to public institutions in all parts of the country.

The history of the Museum is divided into three periods: First, that from the
foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, during which time specimens
were collected purely and solely to serve as materials for research, no special effort
having been made to publicly exhibit them or to utilize them except as a foundation
for scientific description and theory. Second, the period from 1857, when the Insti-
tution assumed the custody of the ‘‘ National Cabinet of Curiosities,’’ to 1876. © Dur-
ing this period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific material which
had already been studied, this material, so far as practicable, being exhibited to the
public, and thus made to serve an educational purpose. Third, the present period,
beginning in the year 1876, during which the Museum has entered upon a career of
active work in gathering collections and exhibiting them on account of their educa-
tional value.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in
the second the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research;
while in the third period there is growing up also the idea of public education.

The three ideas, record, research, and education, cooperative and mutually helpful
as they are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National
Museum endeavors to promote them all.

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an
enormous amount of scientific knowledge, the types of numerous past investigations.
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for
the reports upon the resources of the United States.

It isa museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest
degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research
is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and
instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investi-
gators as well as their trustworthiness as custodians. .

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every
kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its
publications and its named series of duplicates.

The collections are installed in part in the Smithsonian building and in part in
the large building adjacent, covering 2} acres of ground, which was erected in 1881
to afford temporary accommodations for the overflow until such time as an adequate
new building could be constructed.

The intrinsic value of such collections as these can not well be expressed in figures.
There are single specimens worth hundreds, others worth thousands, of dollars, and
still others which are unique and priceless. Many series of specimens which owe
their value to their completeness and to the labor which has been expended on them
can not be replaced at any price. The collections at a forced sale would realize
280 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

more than has been expended on them, and a fair appraisal of their value would
amount to several millions of dollars.

In the direct purchase of specimens but little money has been spent, less, perhaps,
in fifty years than either France, England, Germany, or Austria expends in a single
year on similar objects. The entire Museum is the outgrowth of Government expe-
ditions and expositions, and of the gifts prompted by the generosity of the American
people.

If there were more space it would be possible to devote a special hall to the col-
lections illustrating the life of the races of the Far North—the Eskimos and their kin.
A large hall might be filled with the wonderful groups of models of the races of man-
kind, and particularly of the different tribes of the North American Indians, clothed
in their characteristic costumes and engaged in the arts and occupations peculiar to
each. These groups are recognized in Europe as having no equal, and are now tem-
porarily placed in the lecture room and in various out-of-the-way corners where
their effect and usefulness are largely lost. No other museum in the world has such
rich material in this field, but at present only a small number of exhibition cases can
be devoted to them and the remainder of the material is stowed away in drawers
and packing boxes.

The magnificent mounted groups of the larger animals of America, unsurpassed by
anything of the kind in the world, are now so crowded together in the midst of other
collections that they are scarcely visible, and some of them are packed away. The
great fossil vertebrate animals of North America, of which there is a magnificent
series. A considerable portion of this collection is now stored in the basement of the
museum at Yale College for lack of room to receive it here, although it is much
needed by the geologists of the Geological Survey for purposes of study.

Another hall is needed which might well be devoted to economic geology, illus-
trating the wonderful material wealth of our country and its utilization; and still
another is needed to illustrate the material resources of the country, classified by
States. With the present accommodations the materials and ores of each State are
confined to one or two small cases. A hall of proper extent, arranged upon this
geographical plan, would be one of the most impressive displays of the kind to be
seen anywhere in the world.

The building devoted especially to the Museum was erected after the Centennial
Exhibition in Philadelphia as a temporary accommodation for the collections given
to the United States by the foreign governments and private exhibitors represented
on that occasion. It is the cheapest public building of a permanent character ever
erected, having cost only $2.25 a square foot of floor space available for exhibition.
The museum buildings in Central Park, New York, have cost from $30 to $40a
square foot.

The building in Washington has served a good purpose, but is deficient in one of
the most important particulars; it has no cellars whatever, and very little provision
for workshops and laboratories. In consequence of this it has been necessary to use
all kinds of devices for storing material which can not be exhibited in the exhibition
halls in the bases under the exhibition cases, in small recesses, so ingeniously con-
trived that their presence is not suspected. It has been necessary to do this, but the
result has been to still further increase the crowded condition. 5

Another disagreeable result is that much noisy work has to be done in the Museum
halls in spaces shut off from the publie by screens, and that when preparations for
exhibitions or unpacking are going on, not only are a portion of the collections
closed to the public, but there is a constant and unpleasant noise of hammers.

A temporary relief was secured some years ago by placing the great herbarium,
one of the most important collections of American plants in the world, in the cus-
tody of the Agricultural Department; but last year the Secretary of Agriculture
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 281

found himself unable to longer give these collections house room; and since the
building in which they were kept is not fireproof, and the destruction of the collec-
tion would be an incalculable loss to science, there was nothing to do but to receive
this, and up to the present time a considerable portion of the collection still remains
in danger of destruction by fire, at the Department of Agriculture. There is also a
large amount of other material which ought to be arranged for public exhibition in
a fireproof building which is now in the inflammable wooden structure adjoining the
Department of Agriculture, and which the Secretary is desirous of transferring, if
accommodation can be found for it.

All the collections of the Geological Survey are stored in this building, and a con-
siderable number of the scientific experts employed by the Survey have office room
and accommodations to enable them to study in the Museum building. These
accommodations have become absolutely inadequate, and there is no more room to
receive the collections which the Director of the Survey deems absolutely necessary
to have here in Washington in connection with his investigations of the material
wealth of the country.

The crowded condition of the exhibition halls has been dwelt upon, but that of the
storage rooms is still more congested. In the basement of the old Smithsonian
building, in its towers, and in various small rooms about the new building, there is
a space equivalent to perhaps 200,000 cubic feet, crowded to its utmost capacity with
boxed material. This material is all carefully recorded, and the location and con- ,
tents of every box is definitely fixed, so that when necessary any desired object can
be referred to; but satisfactory use of the collections is impossible. In one basement
room, for instance, : re crowded 50,000 skins of birds, and 50,000 in an adjacent gal-
lery, altogether twelve times as many as are shown in the exhibition hall. So
closely are they crowded that it is impossible even to rearrange them, and their
study is attended with great difficulty. It is desired to separate from among these
the duplicates for distribution to the colleges and schools throughout the country,
and an attempt has been made to accomplish this, but it has been found practically
impossible.

The great collection of alcoholic fishes (the result in part of the explorations of the
Fish Commission), the most extensive in America, and one of the most extensive
in the world, is stored in two basement rooms and only accessible with the greatest
difficulty. Furthermore, the crowding of such a mass of alcoholic material in a
small space is very dangerous, and in case of fire would lead to disastrous results.
Properly equipped museums, like the British Museum in London, have a special
fireproof building for collections of this kind, separate from other buildings, and
provided with special devices for the prevention of fire.

In addition to the storage within the fireproof buildings there are a number of
sheds whose capacity is roughly estimated at 170,000 cubic feet, which are packed
with valuable material, and in which most of the workshops are placed. Two of
these are immediately south of the Smithsonian building, another at the southeast
corner of the Museum building, two others to the southwest of the old Armory build-
ing, and another, temporarily hired, halfway between the Museum and the Capitol.
Until 1888 two floors of the old Armory building were used for the storage of Museum
material. It then became necessary to give up one floor to accommodate the increas-
ing necessities of the Fish Commission, and in 1894 to give it up entirely to the Com-
mission. At that time an appropriation was made to rent storage rooms in the city.
Suitable storage rooms can not be rented; we have had to move twice and are now
being forced to a third move. These moves are destructive and expensive.

The two sheds adjoining the Armory building are getting old and some of the
timbers are rotting away. They can not be repaired because there is no place to put
the material they contain while the work is being done, and they are so crowded
that temporary readjustments for this purpose are not possible.
282 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

All of the wooden storage sheds are in constant danger from destruction by fire.
This is a matter especially serious in connection with two long sheds near the Smith-
sonian building. In his report to the Regents, presented to Congress in 1894, Secre-
tary Langley made an earnest appeal for relief in the following words:

‘T have the assurance of experts that a fire communicated to these rooms would
sweep through the entire length of the building, and although the building itself is
fireproof as against any ordinary danger, it may well be doubted whether any of the
collections therein exhibited can be regarded as safe if the rooms immediately below
should be exposed to so peculiarly severe a conflagration as would be caused by the
ignition of these large quantities of inflammable material. Besides this, these wooden
sheds, which (as I have already intimated) are used not only for storerooms, but for
workshops, for the preservation of specimens, and also as sheds for. the carpenters,
are likewise liable to cause serious losses should a fire be kindled in any of them,
and all of these, | repeat, are immediately under the windows of the Smithsonian
building.

‘In a report recently submitted by one of the inspectors of the Association of Fire
Underwriters, in response to a request from me for a statement as to what insurance
rates would be fixed upon the sheds in question, the Smithsonian building is referred
to as an undesirable risk, owing solely to the presence of all this inflammable mate-
rial underneath and in the adjoining sheds, on which latter insurance can not be
placed for less than $40 per $1,000. This is, | am informed, nearly ten times the
rate which would be charged on an ordinary warehouse. The chief danger, how-
ever, is not to the sheds themselves or their contents, but to the adjoining collec-
tions, which, without reference to their scientific interest but merely to their intrinsic
value, represent a very large sum of money.”

The result of all this crowding and lack of facility for work is that what is accom-
plished for public education by the Museum requires unnecessary and unusual effort,
and that the fullest results are not realized from the appropriations which are made
for this branch of the public service.

Another result is that the value of the collections, the property of the nation, is
not increasing as rapidly as it would otherwise do. The amount of valuable mate-
rial presented and bequeathed to the Museum is not as great as it seemed likely to
be afew years ago. Nothing which is offered is refused, but the authorities of the
Museum do not feel at liberty to ask for gifts when they can not assure the givers
that they can be suitably cared for; and persons having collections to give, being
aware of the lack of room, naturally prefer to place their gifts in institutions where
there is room to receive them.

Notwithstanding these hindrances to the Museum’s progress, the increment from
legitimate sources, especially from the various Departments of the Government,
which are required by law to deposit their accumulations here, was during the year
1895 about 127,000 specimens. In 1894 the accessions were more numerous, the
total exceeding 171,000. This large increase was in part at least due to the fact that
a large number of collections were acquired at the close of the World’s Fair in
Chicago. These were almost without exception collections which had been pre-
pared by foreign exhibitors with the Smithsonian Institution in mind as the ultimate
place of deposit.

It would have been possible to have obtained an immense number of specimens
on this occasion, but it was deemed proper to refrain from efforts in this direction,
not only because of the considerations just referred to but also on account of the
desire of the people of Chicago to retain such objects in their own city as a begin-
ning toward a great civic museum which might serve as a permanent memorial of
the World’s Columbian Exposition. It has always been the policy of the Smith-
sonian Institution to encourage the development of such institutions throughout the
United States, and to assist in developing them, and on this account many proffers
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 983

of specimens were declined, with the recommendation that they be offered to the
Chicago museum, and, so far as it was possible to do so, the attention of exhibitors
who had collections to dispose of was directed toward that institution.

A census of the number of specimens now contained in the various departments
of the Museum shows that the total is about 3,500,000, almost all of which have
been acquired by gift, in exchange for other specimens, or as an equivalent for
publications.

On April 14, 1896, Senator Morrill proposed his bill (Senate No.
698 as amended) as an amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1897,
and it was referred to the Committee on Appropriations. He spoke
upon the measure in the Senate on April 16, prefacing his remarks as
follows:

Mr. President, when the Smithsonian Institution, designed for ‘‘the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men,’’ was put into practical operation, it was discoy-
ered that a national museum would be a large contributor to the great purpose of
the founder, and that the nation was destitute of such an institution. The Smith-
sonian building accordingly early began to be temporarily crowded with many gifts
and objects of rare value, and subsequently a separate building for a museum was
found to be indispensable. Patronized as was this collateral enterprise of the Smith-
sonian by the Government, through many of its Executive Departments, and guided
by the Smithsonian Institution in a scientific and educational direction, as well as in
the practical diffusion of knowledge, it was sure to become an important but inex-
pensive institution of public education, with a constantly increasing collection of
important materials worthy to be intrusted to the custody of a national museum,
where they might be forever preserved and thus increase in value with every
succeeding generation.

His closing words were significant and prophetic:

The additional building now earnestly sought will be equal to the preservation
and exhibition of a very large amount of accumulated material now unhappily
stored away, and will also provide some space for future accumulations that should
not longer be neglected.

The agents of great museums abroad are reported to be regularly employed here,
with authority to purchase any American curios and antiquities, and in some direc-
tions they are supposed to have already obtained better specimens for exhibition
than have been left for us to find.

The New World, of which the United States forms so important a part, in its
prairies and mountains, hills and forests, with their extensive minerals, rocks and
marbles, lakes and rivers, with the animals, game, birds, and fish, the story of the
prehistoric race, the legends of the Indian tribes, as well as the notable modern
history and life of the present inhabitants, all seem to have distinctive features of
their own which belong almost exclusively to the western half of the globe dis-
covered by Columbus. This vast and comparatively ungathered continental field,
with its abounding American treasures, should be harvested by our National Museum
and not surrendered to the more diligent foreign explorers to adorn and enrich only
European museums.

As long as it shall be conducted by the Smithsonian Institution its broad non-
partisan reputation as a national museum of the highest character will not be likely
ever to be disputed or impeached.

While this additional building, with its additional story and cellar, will more than
double the capacity of the present museum, it is probable as the years go by that it
will be necessary to keep step with the research, progress, and record of the Ameri-
can people, and as early as 1926, when our population will be not less than 140,000,000,
284 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

it may be expected that another and grander building in the rear of the Smithsonian,
facing on south B street and connecting the two wings, will be required to mark and
illustrate the age.

2

On April 25, 1896, in the absence of Senator Morrill, Senator George
Gray, also a Smithsonian Regent, moved the amendment to the sundry
civil bill, saying in support of the measure that—

The Senator from Vermont is one of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.
I also have the honor to be one of that body, and I know something in that way of
the necessities for the building provided for in this amendment. There is a large
amount of exceedingly valuable scientific material which is housed there in temporary
wooden sheds, exposed to the peril of conflagration, and which would entail if it were
destroyed incalculable loss, not only upon the Government of the United States, but
upon the scientific world. There are matters there now thus insecurely housed that
could not be replaced. We all know what a credit the Smithsonian Institution is to
the country and to the science of the country. There is no department of the Goy-
ernment that is better conducted, more conscientiously administered in all of its
branches, and from which there are so many benefits, direct and indirect, diffusing
themselves among all the people of the country.

The amendment was then agreed to by the Senate, but the House
disagreed, and on May 21 the Senate receded from its amendment.
Although the bill was again introduced in the Senate at the beginning
of the second session of the Fifty-fourth Congress (January 23, 1897),
‘the subject obtained no further consideration.

In 1897 several expedients were suggested for the relief of the
national collections, none of which had relation to the contemplated
new building. In January of that year inquiries made by the House
Committee on Appropriations were replied to by Secretary Langley
as follows:

I have delayed this reply till I could consult a trustworthy architect as to whether
the walls of the Museum building would bear the additional strain if other stories
were added. It appears to be his opinion that the cost of enlarging the present
structure by additional height would not be warranted by the result, and that the
gain in exhibition space would be largely offset by its loss below from the interfer-
ence with light.

As regards your inquiry about the building known as the Army Medical Museum,
I have to say that this is located at the corner of Seventh and B streeets southwest,
and covers about 21,000 square feet of ground. The center building on B street is
112 feet in length and 54 feet 8 inches in width, exclusive of ornamental and other
projections. It has a basement, and is three full stories in height. A fourth story
is over the main entrance on B street. The structure is flanked by two wings on
each side, 60 by 131 feet, with basement. The heights of the stories are as follows:
Basement, 11 feet; first story, 15 feet; second story, center building, 14 feet, wings,
32 feet; third story, center building, 13 feet; fourth story, center building, extends
to the roof. The total floor space, if the floor were completed at the third story,
would be nearly 90,000 square feet, including the basement, and though all the
building as now arranged is not adapted to museum exhibition purposes, it could
be used so as to be a very great help.

At a meeting of the Regents on January 27, 1897, the Secretary
announced that he had been asked by the Joint Committee on the
-

NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 985

Library what the National Museum had which would serve to decorate
the new Library building, whereupon it was resolyved—

That in the opinion of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution it will
not be expedient or wise to interfere with the integrity of the National Museum by
lending, for the decoration of the Library building, any of the articles or property
now in its care.

At a subsequent meeting of the Board, February 1, on the sugges-
tion of Dr. Charles D. Walcott, in his capacity as Director of the
U.S. Geological Survey, it was resolved—

That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution look with favor upon
the proposition to establish a museum of practical and industrial geology in the
neighborhood of the National Museum.

It has, however, since been arranged that this special feature shall
remain a part of the National Museum.

In his report for 1898, as Acting Assistant Secretary in charge of
the National Museum, Doctor Walcott discussed as follows the neces-
sity for a new building:

The present National Museum building was erected with the view of covering the
largest amount of space with the least outlay of money. In this respect it may be
considered a success. It is, in fact, scarcely more than the shadow of such a massive,
dignified, and well-finished building as should be the home of the great national
collections. There is needed at once a spacious, absolutely fireproof building of
several stories, constructed of durable materials, well lighted, modern in equipment
and.on such a plan that it can be added to as occasion demands in the future. A
site for such a building is already owned by the Government; only the building
needs to be provided for. What the Capitol building is to the nation, the Library
building to the National Library, the Smithsonian building to the Smithsonian
Institution, the new museum building should be to the National Museum. * * *

The growth of the U. 8. National Musuem was rapid under the successful charge
of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode. When the character of the building and the funds
available for its maintenance are considered, it compares favorably with any modern
museum. It has received large collections from the scientific departments of the
Government, and through private contribution (with some additions by purchase
and exchange), all of which have been accommodated as well as could be in the
inadequate laboratories, storerooms, and exhibition space. The galleries just com-
pleted have added 16,000 square feet of floor space, which will help to a certain
extent to relieve the crowded condition of the exhibition halls and courts below.
As an illustration of the present conditions and the necessity for more room, atten-
tion is called to the anthropological collections, which illustrate the development
and progress of man and his works. If the material now in the possession of the
Government in this department should be properly placed on exhibition, it would
occupy the entire space in the present Museum building. The great collections in
zoology, botany, economic geology, general geology, and paleontology should be
entirely removed and placed in a building properly constructed for their study and
exhibition.

In the present building there is a great deficiency in laboratory facilities. Cura-
tors and assistants are hampered for want of room in which to lay out, arrange,
classify, mount, and label specimens. There should also be rooms in which students
could bring together and compare various series of objects, and have at hand books
and scientific apparatus. The present Museum building contains a few rooms suita-
286 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

ble for the purposes mentioned, but the majority have to be used as storerooms,
laboratories, and offices, and are therefore too much crowded to serve in any one
of these capacities. Owing to the pressure for space, courts, halls, and galleries
intended for exhibition purposes, both in the Smithsonian building and in the
Museum building, are unavoidably occupied to a considerable extent as laboratories
and storerooms. This lack of laboratory space is extremely detrimental to the
interests of the Museum.

Beyond six small basement rooms under two of the corner pavilions the present
building has absolutely no provision in the way of basement or other rooms for the
storage of collections which come in from day to day from Government field collect-
ors or private donors, or such as are separated for distribution or held for the use of
students. To remedy this defect many expedients have necessarily been resorted
to, such as placing storage cases (faced with mahogany to make them presentable) in
the exhibition halls, hiring storage rooms in private buildings, and filling up offices,
entrances, staircase landings, and passageways not absolutely indispensable. The
ingenuity which has been exercised in this direction by some of the curators is very
great, and the annoyances that are daily endured in the interest of preserving the
collections deserve notice. What is needed is a series of spacious fireproof basements
for the less perishable objects, the collections preserved in alcohol, and the ordinary
stores and tools, and equally spacious dry lofts and rooms for those collections and
stores which require protection from dampness.

The present Museum building, though large in extent, is overcrowded. It was
built with the cheapest materials and under the cheapest system of construction. Its
lack of architectural dignity and the indifferent character of the materials of which
it is constructed give it the appearance of a temporary structure and tend to cheapen
the effect of the really good cases and the very valuable collections which it contains.
The visitor is everywhere confronted with rough walls, unfinished ceilings, and
obtrusive trusses and supports. It should also be remembered that a considerable
portion of the collections are still in the Smithsonian building, where the crowding
is scarcely less than in the Museum building.

The following are probably the last published remarks by Senator
Morrill on the subject to which so much of his energy had been given.

They were made at a meeting of the Board of Regents on January 26,
1898:

As some of you know, I have been urging a new Museum building for about ten
years. The bills I have introduced have passed through the Senate several times,
but never through the House. I may say now that I shall not live long enough to
get the measure completed. It was heretofore contemplated that there should be a
Museum building on the west of the Smithsonian building, in a position correspond-
ing with the present Museum building, and these two were to be connected by a
building on B street, thus making the largest museum in the country. I have now
about decided to abandon that plan and try to secure the building on B street first.
I merely state this in order to ascertain whether the change of plan is favored by the
Board of Regents.

The suggestion was adopted by the Board, but was subsequently
abandoned when the present plans were started.

The report upon the U. S. National Museum for 1901 contains the
following condensed account of the condition and requirements of the
collections, by the present assistant secretary in charge:

Attention has repeatedly been called to the inadequacy of the present accommo-
dations for the national collections. The Smithsonian building had become fully
)

occupied some twenty-five years ago, when the large contributions to the Govern-
ment from exhibitors at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition led to the erection
of the Museum building, completed in 1881. By 1883 this structure was also filled,
and though numerous efforts have since heen made to secure more ample quarters,
all have met with failure. In 1888, 1890, and 1892 the Senate voted $500,000 for a
new building, and in 1896, $250,000, but none of these measures was even considered
in the House of Representatives.

There has been no abatement in the number of collections received annually, but
in fact a general increase from year to year, and a severe task has thus devolved
upon the Museum authorities in arranging for their disposition. New specimens
have constantly been added to the exhibition halls and storage rooms until both are
overcrowded to the extent that in the one the objects, as a rule, can not be properly
viewed by visitors, and in the other their classification has become impossible, and
they are for the most part practically inaccessible for study. But so extensive have
been the accessions that only a part could be disposed of in this manner, and. it
became necessary, several years ago, to resort to outside storage, which is now pro-
vided for in an old wooden shed upon the Mall and in several rented buildings.
None of these buildings is of fireproof construction, though they contain collections
of great value and in large part not replaceable. They also lack facilities for the
classification and arrangement of the specimens, which are packed away in shipping
boxes, and for the time serve no purpose of any kind.

The collections made by the Government surveys, of which the Museum is the
legal custodian, can continue to be received and housed, as additional storage build-
ings may be leased, if necessary, though the further provision of the law to make
them at all times available for study and examination can no longer be carried out.
The same applies to specimens obtained by purchase or exchange and to such dona-
tions as are given without condition. The Museum is in fact being resolved into a
mere storehouse of material which comes to it mainly without solicitation, and its
larger purpose, while never lost sight of, is becoming more and more difficult to
maintain. Its reserve or record collections in every branch should be so systemat-
ically arranged that any specimens desired for study could immediately be found;
the public exhibition should comprise the entire range of Museum subjects, and be
installed effectively and without crowding, and there should be ample and well-
appointed working quarters, in which all the activities of the establishment could
be conveniently carried on.

With the conditions as they now are, it is not to be wondered at that the National
Museum lacks that character of support which has done so much for many other
museums. Its donations are generally small and relatively unimportant. The
possessors of large and valuable collections will not present them where they can
not be at once displayed or well arranged. Such inducements can now rarely be
offered here, but many of the larger museums elsewhere owe their principal growth
to generous gifts from wealthy patrons of science and the arts. Specific men-
tion could be made of several large collections which their owners would have
preferred to place at the national capital, but which have been given to or deposited
in other museums, because in Washington they would have to be packed away for
an indefinite period, at great risk of injury and destruction.

The amount of floor space occupied by the national collections is very much
smaller than would appear to the casual visitor. The two main buildings contain,
in fact, only 195,486 square feet, to which the outside buildings, mostly rented, add
43,203 square feet, making a total of 238,689 square feet. The latter are partly occu-
pied by workshops, but are mainly used for the gross storage of specimens, and in no
case for exhibition or for the arrangement in classified order of the reserve series.

In London the subjects represented by the United States National Museum are
distributed among several museums, such as the British Museum, leaving out the
288 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Library, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Museum of Practical Geology,
which now have an aggregate of 989,388 square feet of floor space, soon to be
increased by 400,000 or 500,000 square feet in the new addition to the Victoria and
Albert Museum. In Berlin seven of the national museums relating to natural his-
tory and the industrial arts possess some 575,000 square feet of area, and the new
National History. Museum of Vienna has over 350,000 square feet alone. In our own
country, the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, which, when
completed, will cover a ground area of over 53 acres, already has 356,800 square feet
of floor space available.

A study of the conditions in Washington has shown that to properly arrange the
national collections and provide for the growth of perhaps fifteen or twenty years
would require additional floor space to the extent of something like 400,000 or
500,000 square feet. If this were obtained through the construction of a new build-
ing having that amount of room, it would still be necessary to utilize both of the
present buildings, and this seems the preferable course to pursue.

The efforts of Senator Morrill, though so persistent and well
directed, were not to bear their fruit, as he himself had intimated,
until after his lamented death, and, in fact, there was to be a lapse of
five years before the culmination of his wishes was definitely assured.
His large share in the final result must not be forgotten. Four times
did he secure a majority vote in the Senate, and his influence in the
House is shown by the favorable consideration given his bills by the
committees to which they were referred. His part, it is now recog-
nized, was in the direction of educating, of impressing upon Congress
the needs of the national collections, which he did by keeping the sub-
ject continually alive for over ten years, through the frequent intro-
duction of bills, the presentation of reports in which the requirements
of the Museum were set forth in detail, and his own impressive
remarks upon the floor. It came, therefore, to be not a question of
whether the Museum should have additional and more worthy quarters,
but rather one of finance; could the necessary funds, in the opinion of
Congress, be granted for the purpose 4

Accordingly, the following request, which appeared in the Book of
Estimates for 1903, occasioned no surprise:

Plans for additional fireproof building, National Museum: For the preparation,
under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, of preliminary
plans for an additional fireproof building for the United States National Museum, to
be erected on the Mall between Ninth and Twelfth streets west, including the
expense of collecting necessary data, said plans and such recommendations thereon
as the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution may deem necessary to be transmitted
to Congress at its next regular session, five thousand dollars, to be immediately
available.

Note accompanying estimate.—In 1879 Congress appropriated $250,000 for the erec-
tion of a building to meet the urgent needs of the National Museum. The structure
then put up, and completed within the appropriation, was practically only a large
storehouse, with few of the facilities demanded by a large museum, and was at the
time expected to fill but a temporary want. It has in fact, however, been made to
serve a most useful purpose and should continue so to do, but its accommodations
have in all respects been long outgrown. By 1885 its exhibition halls and storage

rooms were already fiiled; by 1890 they were in a congested condition. Since then
it has been necessary to lease temporary quarters for the incoming collections, these
quarters being increased from year to year until they now hold as much in quantity
as the Museum building itself. In these places the collections are in constant dan-
ger from fire, and being stored in packing cases, are subject to deterioration.

The National Museum is constantly in receipt of large and important collections
from private sources, which add to its wealth of treasures. The collections are
mainly, howeyer, the product of the Government surveys, obtained at great cost and
constituting the material records of all national explorations. They are, therefore,
practically not replaceable. All collections from these sources were by Congressional
acts of 1846 and 1879 committed to the custody of the Smithsonian Institution, with
provision for their scientific classification and arrangement. Under the conditions
. existing it becomes impossible to carry out either the spirit or the letter of the law.
It is recommended that the sum of $5,000 be appropriated for the preparation of
plans for a new Museum building.

Certain tentative sketch plans had previously been prepared, in
order to indicate to the Regents the general style and approximate size
of a building which it was thought would best meet the requirements.
The cost of such a building in stone was estimated at from $5,000,000
to $6,000,000. The matter was discussed with the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, the Secretary and others
appearing before them in support of the measure. A definite sum for
the cost of the building had not been fixed, nor were the tentative
plans considered as entirely appropriate to be followed. It was
explained that the amount named in the estimate was required to per-
mit of a more careful study of the conditions, and that the plans to
be prepared would embody only the actual needs. The item was not
reported by the House committee, but passed the Senate with a clause
limiting the cost of the building to $2,500,000. In conference, how-
ever, this limit was reduced to $1,500,000, the bill as passed, in con-
nection with the sundry civil act for 1903, being as follows:

Plans for additional building, National Museum: For the preparation, under the
direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, of preliminary plans for an
additional fireproof steel-frame brick and terra cotta building, to cost not exceeding
one million five hundred thousand dollars, for the United States National Museum,
to be erected, when appropriated for, on the Mall, between Ninth and Twelfth
streets west, said plans when completed to be transmitted by the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution to Congress, five thousand dollars.

The preliminary plans called for by the above act were completed
during the following winter and on January 22, 1903, they were pre-
sented, together with an explanatory report, to a special committee of
the Board of Regents, appointed the previous year, **to represent to
Congress the pressing necessity of additional room for the proper
exhibition of specimens belonging to the National Museum.” This
committee, consisting of the six Congressional Regents, namely, Sen-
ators O. H. Platt, S. M. Cullom, and F. M. Cockrell, and Representa-
tives R. R. Hitt, Robert Adams, jr., and Hugh A. Dinsmore, after

NAT Mus 1903——19
290 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

a full discussion, passed the following resolution, which was subse-
quently transmitted to Congress:

That under the limitations of the law the committee hereby report to Congress
Plan B for a new National Museum building as the best obtainable for the amount
mentioned; but in the judgment of the committee the larger plan, A, is believed
to be the one which should be adopted, and we therefore ask that Congress shall
make the appropriation for it instead of for the smaller plan.

On January 23, 1903, the plans and report were transmitted to Con-
gress and printed as Document No. 314, House of Representatives,
Fifty-seventh Congress, second session. The arguments presented in
the report have practically all been set forth in previous pages of this
paper, and therefore only such extracts need be quoted here as relate
to the plans and to the questions directly concerning their preparation.
Of the plans themselves only two are given, one, marked ‘*A,” show-
ing the outlines of the entire building as then designed, the other,
marked ‘* B,” showing the half of the building, which it was estimated

=?
could be erected for the sum of $1,500,000, the limit of cost first
established. Following are the extracts from the report prepared by

the assistant secretary in charge of the Museum:

The plan contemplates a rectangular building about 486 feet front by about 345
feet deep and about 80 feet high including the basement. The building is designed
for four floors, and will afford about 400,000 square feet of floor space, the first and
second floors to be used for exhibition, the basement and upper floor for storage,
workrooms, and other purposes necessary to the conduct of a museum. It could be
erected in substantial form as a fireproof building for a sum not exceeding $3,000,000.

The plan has been designed in such a manner that approximately one-half of the
building could be constructed at once, presenting the appearance of a completed
building and suitable for the Museum needs. This half would consist of the main
or south wing and the middle wing, and is exhibited in a separate drawing. Whilst
it would in no way provide for the growth of the Museum, it would relieve the
present congested condition of the exhibition halls, render possible a proper classifi-
cation of the reserve collections, and remove the necessity of employing any rented
buildings.

The plan of the building has been drawn after a study of all important existing
museums, both in this country and abroad, and embodies their useful features and
avoids defects which have been revealed in the course of time. It is expected that,
should this building be authorized, it would be superior for museum purposes to any
building in this country or abroad, and it is respectfully recommended that the sum
of $1,500,000 be appropriated for the construction of substantially so much of the
building as is exhibited in Plan B.

* * * * * * %*

The National Museum occupies the building erected for its use in 1881, the greater
part of the Smithsonian building, parts of three detached buildings on the Mall, and
several rented buildings south of B street SW. The area represented, together with
the general use to which the several floors of the larger buildings and each of the
smaller buildings are devoted, is shown in the following table:

An inspection of the several buildings shows conditions which are exceedingly
deplorable for the National Museum of a great country. Every branch is seriously
hampered by the total inadequacy of the space assigned it, and the proper disposition
of specimens long ago became impossible, with the result that year after year valu-
able collections, often of large size, have had to be packed away in insecure rented
buildings, where they are also inaccessible. While the Museum building is not ill
adapted to exhibition purposes, it is much too small to serve the present needs. Its
halls are overcrowded, the cases being generally placed so near together that two
persons can scarcely pass between them and no effective view of their contents can
be obtained. An increase in space of one-half to two-thirds at least would be nec-
essary to properly display the present contents of these halls.
292 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Having practically no basement, the only space available for the reserve storage,
workrooms, and offices is the small rooms of the central towers and corner pavilions,
except that some of the galleries designed for exhibition have from necessity been
turned over to these purposes. In these quarters the specimens are packed almost
solidly, in cases generally reaching to such a height as to make access to the upper
ones extremely inconvenient. The workers have scarcely room in which to place
their tables, and there is little space anywhere for the spreading out of specimens for
purposes of study and classification or of preparation for exhibition.

In the Smithsonian building, which was originally designed to be used only in
small part for museum purposes, the conditions are similar. There are four exhi-
bition halls, three used for zoology and one for prehistoric archeology. The latter,
occupying the entire upper floor of the main building, has, through the loosening
and fall of large areas of plaster from the ceiling, been pronounced unsafe and closed
to the public until funds can be obtained for its repair and renovation. The large
corresponding room on the ground floor has four galleries extending nearly its entire
length, which some fifteen years ago were turned into work and storage quarters
for several branches of zoology. They are overcrowded with cases and tables and
are, moreover, extremely unhealthful places for the assistants stationed there because
of the impure air arising from the exhibition floor below.

In the basement is stored the greater part of the valuable alcoholic collection of
the Museum, in a series of dark, damp rooms, wholly unsuited to the purpose, and
where a great deal of work has to be carried on. The other workrooms and store-
rooms in the Smithsonian building, besides two or three small ones on the main
floor, are in the north tower, which is utilized for these purposes up to the height of
the seventh story. It is scarcely necessary to explain that many of these rooms, all
of which are very small, are inconvenient of access, and that specimens can be car-
ried to and from them only with difficulty.

Many of the activities of the Museum and much the greater part of its storage have
for a long period had to be provided for in outside buildings, partly on the Mall and
partly rented at an annual expense of over $4,000. The taxidermists are quartered
in the upper part of the Smithsonian stable and in a temporary frame structure back
of the Smithsonian building. On Armory square, adjoining the Fish Commission
building, is an old, dilapidated wooden shed filled with specimens. On Ninth street
SW. there is under lease a large area of land covered with wooden sheds containing
an immense amount of valuable collections and much other Museum property. The
greater part of the so-called Marsh collection of vertebrate fossils, which has been
valued at above $150,000, isstill stored in a rented building at Tenth street and Mary-
land avenue, which also provides space for several preparators’ workshops. Two
other rented buildings are likewise required to accommodate the extensive carpenter,
paint, and glazing shops which are required for the making of furniture and for the
repairs about the main buildings.

In order to carry out the purposes for which it exists, the National Museum requires
a greatly increased amount of space and that any additional space provided be better
adapted to its wants than that now occupied.

For the exhibition collections a connected series of relatively large rooms or halls
is needed to permit of the arrangement of the specimens and groups of specimens
(many being of considerable size) in such manner as will best adapt them to the
comprehension of the public and, by the avoidance of crowding, allow them to be
viewed effectively.

The record collections, commonly known as the reserve or study series, comprising
the bulk of the material in most departments, while demanding such a convenient
disposition as will insure the ready examination of specimens, require relatively less
space than the exhibition collections, as they can be much more compactly arranged
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 293

in drawers and on shelves. Yet their extent is so great that the question of their
accommodation is one of the most important ones for consideration. They have
been mainly derived from the Government surveys of the past sixty years and rep-
resent a very large expenditure of public money.

For the activities of the Museum are needed many well-lighted and well-appointed
rooms to serve as laboratories for classifying collections and for scientific research
and as workshops for the preparation of specimens for study and for exhibition. It
should be noted in this connection that the Museum is called upon to furnish work-
rooms for several of the scientific bureaus, whose collections are partly studied there,
and that, by a recent act of Congress, it is incumbent upon the Museum to provide
facilities for such students and investigators from any part of the country as may
choose to visit it for purposes of research.

Finally, space must be provided for certain general and miscellaneous purposes,
such as the mechanical workshops and storerooms, the heating plant, public-comfort
rooms, the library, a lecture hall, the administrative offices, ete.

An estimate of the amount of space needed has been reached by a careful consid-
eration of the several requirements as set forth below, namely:

(1) To relieve the present very congested condition of the exhibition halls.

(2) To provide for the display of objects now in storage which are suitable and
intended for public exhibition.

(3) Convenient and systematic storage for the vast reserve or record collections,
which are now for the most part inaccessible for examination.

(4) Suitable scientific laboratories, preparators’ workshops, etc.

(5) The mechanical workshops required in making repairs to buildings and in the
construction and repair of cases and other furniture and fixtures.

(6) Offices necessary for administrative and other purposes common to all the
branches of the Museum.

(7) The space required for the heating plant, the library, a lecture hall, public-
comfort rooms, and other miscellaneous purposes.

(8) Provision for future growth. The limitation of cost fixed by the sundry civil
appropriation act of June 28, 1902, prevents the carrying out of any extravagant
views in this regard; and if the building erected have only the area contemplated by
the plans submitted the National Museum will again be crowded and in need of
room certainly before the end of another ten years and probably of five years.

The growth of the Museum for a number of years past has been mainly through
the receipt of material which by law it must receive and care for. The amount of
material declined or diverted elsewhere during the last ten or fifteen years because of
the lack of room would have occupied a very large proportion of the present exhi-
bition space and have greatly increased the money value of the collections. The
same Conditions have prevented the Museum authorities from soliciting large contri-
butions, but with adequate facilities many extensive exhibits can be had for the
asking. The department of arts and industries, the more practical side of the
Museum, has perhaps suffered most from the lack of accommodations. Large exhibits
have had to be removed to storage, and the growth of this most important and
striking branch was necessarily stopped some time ago. It should be made here, as
it has been in all the larger capitals of the world, one of the most important features
of the national collections, and its increase, once stimulated, would go forward rap-
idly and at relatively small expense, as generous donations might be expected from
all quarters.

Using the above topics as a basis for calculations, the amount of space imme-
diately required has been worked out for each of the departments. This information
is summarized in the following table, which gives also for each subject the space
now occupied. With regard to the present storage areas, it should be borne in mind
294 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

that much of the material is now compactly stored in packing boxes, and if trans-
ferred to classified storage would spread out over many times the space. The depart-
ments named are those under which the Museum is classified for.convenience of
administration.

With regard to the space now occupied, there are certain areas which, for various

reasons, should be abandoned, namely:

Deducting this area from the total area now occupied (238,689 square feet) leaves
182,601 square feet as the amount of space now actually available and appropriate
for the future needs of the Museum. Again, deducting this amount from the total
space named above as required for the Museum (670,000 square feet) leaves approx-
imately 487,000 square feet to be provided for in a new building. The sum named
in the sundry civil act of June 28, 1902 ($1,500,000) as the limit of cost for the pro-
posed new building will not, however, permit of the erection by any method of
construction of a building having that amount of space.

Several plans have been drawn in an effort to reconcile the needs of the Museum
with the limitation of cost proposed by Congress, but none successfully. The last
plan, contemplating the smallest size of building thgt it has been judged advisable
to recommend, is the one herewith presented. It. represents a rectangular build-
ing, having a frontage of about 486 feet, a depth of about 345 feet, not including
projections, and a height above the ground at the front of about 70 feet. There will
be two open courts. The building is designed to have four floors, inclusive of the
basement (which will underlie the entire structure), and will afford about 400,000
square feet of floor space. The first and second floors are intended to be used for
NATIONAL MUSEUM—BUILDINGS. 295

the public exhibition collections and the basement and upper floor for the reserve
or record collections, workrooms, offices, and other general and miscellaneous pur-
poses. This is an approximately equal division of the space between the public
halls and the other requirements of the Museum. The plan shows entire simplicity
of design, and has been drawn with reference to the use of brick and terra cotta in
the construction of the outer faces, although stone could be substituted for these
materials if so ordered.

The interior arrangement above the basement is a combination of large and small
halls, the three largest halls being lighted from above and having two series of gal-
leries of sufficient width to permit of their being screened off and made into series of
separate rooms for exhibition and other purposes. This arrangement has been
adopted as practically furnishing the largest possible amount of well-lighted floor
space ina building of the size proposed, and as presenting many other important
advantages. It is felt that a building put up on these lines would in many, if not in
all, respects prove superior for museum purposes to those of any existing museums,
either at home or abroad.

The cost of erecting a building in accordance with the plan submitted in a most
simple though substantial manner has been estimated at about $3,000,000. The
plan has been so designed, howeyer, that approximately one-half the building can
be constructed separately, with practically the appearance of a completed building
and suited to the different kinds of museum requirements. This half would consist
of the main or south wing and the middle wing, as represented in a separate draw-
ing. While this part would not provide for future growth, it would relieve the
present congested condition of the Museum, make outside storage unnecessary, and
render possible a safe disposition and essentially convenient arrangement of the
present collections.

This half section of the building as planned could be erected for $1,500,000.

At the hearing before the House Committee on Appropriations, on
January 23, 1903, the question of legislation for the new building was
thoroughly discussed. It was not doubted that half the building could
be erected within the limit of $1,500,000 fixed by the act of the previ-
ous year, and the entire building for not exceeding $3,000,000, but in
either case the fronts would require to be constructed of brick and
terra cotta. There was no objection to the use of these materials on
the score of durability, but in view of the large size of the building,
its conspicuous position, and the fact that it would be expected to rank
among the prominent public structures at the capital, it was urged
upon the committee that stone fronts would produce a more dignified
effect, and that the change in this respect would not add extravagantly
to the cost of the building. Estimates showed, in fact, that if stone
were employed the entire building could be erected within the sum of
$3,500,000, and one-half the building within $1,625,000.

The matter was not reported to the House in any form, but in the
Senate the granting of the full sum was favorably considered, and the
bill as there passed was finally agreed to in conference as an item in
the sundry civilact for the year ending June 30, 1904. It isas follows:

Building for National Museum: To enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-

tion to commence the erection of a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts, for
the use of the National Museum, to be erected on the north side of the Mall, between
296 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Ninth and Twelfth streets northwest, substantially in accordance with the Plan A,
prepared and submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
under the provisions of the act approved June twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred and
two, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Said building complete, including
heating and ventilating apparatus and elevators, shall cost not to exceed three million
five hundred thousand dollars, and a contract or contracts for its completion is hereby
authorized to be entered into subject to appropriations to be made by Congress.
The construction shall be in charge of Bernard R. Green, Superintendent of Build-
ings and Grounds, Library of Congress, who shall make the contracts herein author-
ized and disburse all appropriations made for the work, and shall receive as full
compensation for his services hereunder the sum of two thousand dollars annually
in addition to his present salary, to be paid out of said appropriations.

Ata meeting of the Board of Regents on March 12, 19038, the passage
of the above act was announced, and it was resolved:

That the Secretary, with the advice and consent of the chancellor and the chair-
man of the executive committee, be authorized to represent the Board of Regents so
far as may be necessary in consultation with Bernard R. Green, to whom the con-
struction and contracts for the new Museum building are committed by Congress in
the act making an appropriation for that purpose.

Some little time was consumed in the preliminary arrangements,
which included the selection of Messrs. Hornblower & Marshall, of
Washington, as the architects of the building. They had made the
first tentative sketches and the preliminary plans previously mentioned,
and it may also be said that for a number of years they have acted
for the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum in all matters
requiring architectural advice. They have likewise recently visited
many of the prominent museums of Europe, which has given them an
invaluable experience in museum requirements.

At the time of writing the general plans, showing the several floors
and facades, are nearing completion.

DESCRIPTION.

It is impossible at the present time to describe more than the lead-
ing features of this structure, since, though work upon the foundation
has begun, the plans are not entirely completed. The building will
he rectangular in shape, and faced with granite on all sides. It will
have a length of 551 feet, a width of 318 feet, exclusive of projections,
and a height of stonework above the basement floor of 77 feet. There
will be four stories including the basement, which, beginning above
the level of the adjoining street, will be well lighted and entirely
available for use. The main and second stories will contain the exhibi-
tion collections, while the basement and upper story will be allotted to
the many other requirements of a large museum.

Ina general way it may be said that the building will consist pri-
marily of a main part in the shape of a broad T, comprising three
wide wings or sections diverging at right angles from a large rotunda
at the southern or principal entrance. Ranges of narrower width,

one on each side and two at the north, will connect the three ends of
the T or main sections so as to inclose two large open courts (each 128
feet square), and thus complete the quadrangle. The two south sec-
tions, which, with the rotunda, comprise the front part of the build-
ing, will project slightly at each end beyond the walls of the side
ranges.

The new structure will be located on the north side of the Mall, in
the so-called Smithsonian Park, about midway between Ninth and
Twelfth streets, directly in front of the Smithsonian building, and with
its center, like that of the latter, on the axis of Tenth street. While
the main front and entrance will face southward, or toward the mid-
dle of the park, there will also be a commodious entrance by way of
the basement on the north, as an approach from Tenth street. The
northern fagade will be about 78 feet from the sidewalk of B street
north, while the central projection thereof, containing the entrance,
will reach about 25 feet nearer to the street.

As the land rises rapidly southward from B street, it has been
planned to have the basement floor slightly above the level of that
street, but at the south the top of the basement will be nearly ona
level with the ground. Suitable embankments will be built along the
sides of the building, inclosing a broad area, which will also extend
along the south front, thus making the basement equivalent to a full
story for at least workroom, laboratory, storage, and heating purposes.
Its height will be 14 feet.

The first and second stories, intended for the public, will be 20 feet
and 19 feet 5 inches high, respectively. The windows will measure 14
feet 9 inches high in the first and 12 feet high in the second, the cor-
responding ones in the two stories occupying the same embrasure,
though separated by ornamental metal work. These windows will be
about 114 feet wide, and the intervening wall space about 7 feet wide,
giving a unit for the installation of exhibits of 18 feet 6 inches.

The third story will be 12 feet in height, with windows about 7 feet
high by 5 feet 3 inches wide, thus furnishing ample light for all the
requirements of the laboratories and storerooms. In the three main
sections of the building there will be still another low story above the
last, suitable for the storage of dried specimens.

The relatively small amount appropriated for this large building
has demanded simplicity of design and the omission of all extrava-
gant decoration. The lines and proportions have been so well planned,
however, that the structure can not fail to be one of great dignity
and beauty and a worthy addition to the public buildings in Wash-
ington. The granite will be laid in ashlar courses, but the entrances
will be worked up with a certain amount of elaborateness. A metal
dome, with skylight, will cover the rotunda, and there will also be sky-
lights aiong the main roofs for lighting the large halls.
298 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The rotunda at the south, or main, entrance will be about 116 feet
square, and lighted entirely from above. It will connect directly
with the three great halls, which are to be similar in character and
of the same length and width, about 209 by 116 feet, all provided
with galleries except at the inner ends adjoining the rotunda. The
galleries along the sides will be 82 feet wide, leaving an interspace of
50 feet width. This central or open part of the main halls will be 148
feet long and reach to ceiling lights under the skylights, a distance
of 60 feet, while the galleries and sides of the first story will receive
their light from the large windows of the fronts and courts. The
galleries of the second and third floors are intended to be entirely
screened off from the central halls and treated as space that can be
divided to suit the requirements. The space under the galleries may
be treated in the same way or left open, as circumstances may dictate.

The remainder of the building, consisting of the ranges on the east,
west, and north, will be 55 feet in interior width and have solid floors,
one above the other, their light being entirely obtained from windows.

The main and second floors will, as before stated, be used wholly
for the public exhibition collections, while the upper floor will be
divided into laboratories and storage rooms for the reserve collections.
The basement will have the same dimensions as the first floor, but
under the main halls it will require to be jighted artificially. The side
areas will be of sufficient width for teams, which may enter the build-
ing at both ends of the south front. One of the south wings of the
basement will be utilized for the boilers, power plant, mechanical
workshops, ete.; the other, as well as the ranges, probably for labora-
tories and for the storage of specimens in such lines as can best be
accommodated there, though some parts of the ranges may be availed
of for exhibition purposes.

The northern entrance will be by way of the basement, into a large
vestibule with elevators and stairways. There will also be passage-
ways leading in all three directions, the central one communicating
directly with a small lecture hall occupying the center of the middle
section of the basement. On each side of this hall will be a series of
small rooms, some of which can be used for committee meetings.

The net floor area of the building will be about 411,374 square feet,
or about 9.44 acres, subdivided as follows: Basement and main floor,
each about 116,782 square feet; second and third floors, each about
88,955 square feet.

FLOOR SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

STUDIES OF THE MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS OF
NEW YORK CITY, ALBANY, BUFFALO, AND CHICAGO; NOTES
ON SOME EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS.

By A. B. Meyer,
Director of the Royal Zoological, Anthropological, and Ethnographical Museum of Dresden.

A.—Musreums AND KInpRED InNstiruTIoNs oF New York City,
ALBANY, BUFFALO, AND CHICAGO.4

INTRODUCTION.

The authorities of the Royal Collections of Art and Science in
Dresden commissioned me in 1899 to visit the museums and kindred
institutions of the United States so far as they relate to museum affairs,
and to pay special attention to the preservation of the collections from
fire. In the time at my disposal I could master only a portion of
what might properly have been studied. I was moreover obliged to
confine myself to the eastern part of that great country; even then
I had to turn aside from a number of cities and scientific centers well
worthy of study, and I was far from able to exhaust the subject even
in those places that I visited. This will explain many omissions in
my report. I was in New York from the 8th to the 26th of August
and from the 19th to the 31st of October, in Albany from the 26th to
the 29th of August, in Buffalo on the 29th and 30th of August, in
Chicago from the 5th to the 13th of September, in Washington from
the 14th to the 27th of September, in Philadelphia from the 27th of
September to the 5th of October, and in Boston and Cambridge from
the 5th to the 19th of October.

The parts of my report here presented include studies in New York
City, Albany, Buffalo, and Chicago, and it is intended that other parts
shall be printed as soon as possible, giving results of my studies in
Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, and Cambridge.

In the United States a sharp distinction can not always be made
between museums and libraries, since many of the latter also include

collections of art and science; but apart from this the libraries have
in general already attained a higher degree of development than the
museums, and for that reason I was the less able to pass them by.
All things considered, the American libraries perhaps excel those of
Europe in architecture and in administration methods, whereas this is
not yet so decidedly the case with the museums. As both the libra-
ries and the museums of the United States are almost unknown to us,
I have assumed this lack of acquaintance in my report. However
great the ignorance of Americans regarding Germany may be, it is at
all events exceeded by the ignorance of the Germans regarding the
United States. Although year after year more than a thousand young
Americans study in German schools and thousands of men and women
of the educated classes of the Union annually visit the ‘t Fatherland,”
as Germany is affectionately called, proportionately few educated
Germans go to the United States merely for the purpose of becoming
acquainted with that country, with tie exception of those who go to
America to recuperate in the sharp atmosphere which stirs there.
Although German colleagues who had visited American museums
and Americans who came to Germany told me that ‘‘ we had not much
to learn there,” still the authoritative opinions of men like Zittel, Ball,
and Wallace indicated otherwise. In 1883 the well-known paleon-
tologist of Munich expressed the opinion that the Americans had begun
to make their natural history treasures accessible to the public and to
specialists in a manner worthy in many respects of admiration and
imitation. In 1885 the late director of the Science and Art Museums
in Dublin was particularly impressed with the methodical planning,
thoroughness, and order prevailing in the majority of the American
museums. Many, though of recent date, already displayed an astound-
ing development of strength, and the American people were looking
forward with great and joyful hopes to a giant increase of their spheres
of usefulness. Finally the distinguished English naturalist declared, in
1887, that the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University,
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, widely known as the Agassiz Museum,
far excelled all European museums as an educational institution for
the public, for students, and for the special investigator. That, how-
ever, was half a generation ago, a period which in America counts for
as much as half a century or more with us; in fact, during the last
twenty years many imposing libraries and museums have been estab-
lished in the United States. New York, above all, shows the evident
tendency to become the ‘‘ first city of the world.” It will at all events
become the greatest by its natural power of expansion and its location.
The ardent desire of everyone’s local patriotism is to accomplish the
best. and I believe that this aim will in time be attained. We Euro-
peans must, each in his place, exert all our strength to avoid being
outstripped. The other great cities of the eastern part of the United
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. ovo

States which were all I was able to visit, likewise offered material
beyond my expectation in the field of my studies.

I was considerably impressed with the capacity of Americans in this
department, and am inclined to maintain that museum affairs in gen-
eral are on a higher plane than in Europe. This is irrespective of
material, and refers more to scientific than to art institutions. So far
as the buildings and administrative affairs are concerned, Europeans
have few good and many ordinary and even bad museums. The Ameri-
cans, on the other hand (I speak only of the eastern part of the coun-
try visited by me), have many more good and fewer ordinary or bad
museums. These inferior museums, however, improve rapidly, cor-
responding to the pace maintained in that country, whereas in Europe
the rate of improvement is hopelessly slow.

The unparalleled rapid development of affairs in the United States
as compared with the Old World repels a critical method of examina-
tion by the observer, not only because what has been accomplished is
in a high degree worthy of respect and admiration, nay, is often even
overwhelming, but also because such criticism would, in many cases,
be forestalled by changed conditions, so that the critic in judging the
rapidly changing conditions must keep in mind the future not less than
the present, and must even regard the projected as already accom-
plished. I therefore confine myself in the main portion of my report
more to making conspicuous the positive, the instructive, and what is
new to us, and relegate any critical remarks to footnotes, in order
not to mar the general impression of my statements. With regard to
these criticisms, I must guard against referring to European or even
Dresden museums as if things were better in these. On the contrary,
things are generally not done as well on this side of the ‘* pond,” as
the Americans call the Atlantic Ocean. I should, therefore, have pre-
ferred to suppress such remarks entirely, but where there is light
there are generally shadows also, and, honor to truth, I promised
American friends and colleagues not to do so. It was thought that
something might be gained here and there by criticism. But, although
this may not come to pass, I wished to show my gratitude, in some
measure at least, since the reception accorded me by all those interested
in similar subjects with whom I had the pleasure of becoming closely
acquainted was so obliging and overcoming that I can hardly express
my feelings in words. There are no men more ready to help or more
amiable than the learned citizens of the Union, and I hope that they
will regard my report only as a ‘‘ tribute of admiration and gratitude.”

EFFORTS OF THE AMERICAN NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUMS TO
INCREASE THEIR USEFULNESS.4

[The following observations, written by Doctor Meyer since the above introduction to the present
work was printed, are added as of interest herein.]

There are in the United States 8,000 public libraries containing
50,000,000 volumes. Sixty of these libraries contain over 100,000
volumes each, and four of them have 500,000 each.? The increase in
the number of public museums does not keep pace with this amazing
increase in the number of. libraries, although it has often been recom-
mended that a small popular museum be attached to each public library.¢
There are 350 public museums, of which 250 are natural history muse-
ums.” Germany has perhaps 500 or more, among them 150 natural
history museums.® Of the latter, France has 300,/ and Great Britain
250.7 Of the 250 natural history museums in the United States, 175
belong to schools and universities, 30 to learned societies, 30 are State
museums, and 15 are maintained by private individuals or are sup-
ported by municipal funds. The State of New York, with 7,000,000
inhabitants, has thirty-one natural history museums; Pennsylvania with
6,000,000, nineteen; Massachusetts with 8,000,000, seventeen; Illinois
with 5,000,000, fifteen; Ohio with 4,000,000, fourteen; California with
1,500,000, ten;? ete. The natural history museums, therefore, by
virtue of their number, already play an important part not only as
scientific museums, but also as a means of popular education, when we
consider the efforts being made to serve the entire community. This
will be evident from the following brief account:

the first to carefully consider such a plan,” had developed the princi-
ples on which he meant to separate an exhibition collection for visitors
from a scientific collection for investigators in the museum of compara-
tive zoology, which he was to establish at Cambridge in the United
States. He actually carried out these plans a few years later. It was
a long time before his ideas were adopted in Europe; but ali new
museums in the United States, at least, were similarly arranged from
that time. In 1881 the U.S. National Museumat Washington adopted
as of prime importance the general principle *‘to place no object on
exhibition which had not some special educational value and which was
not capable of attracting and instructing a large proportion of the
visitors.” ‘The U. S. National Museum, therefore, definitely adopted
the principles which subsequently determined to a greater or lesser
degree the mode of operation of all natural history museums in the
United States. Consequently, the visitor to a museum is not tor-
mented with endless series of like or similar objects, and he need not
himself laboriously pick out from an excess of material the objects
which are to him comprehensible, instructive, or entertaining. They
are placed before him without any annoying and tiresome labor on his
part. The carrying out of this principle, essential to an exhibition
collection, is in general made easy for the American museums by the
circumstance that means are willingly furnished them for the purpose.
Every month at the New York Natural History Museum they place
on exhibition those migratory birds which occur in the vicinity at
that particular time. This fact is mentioned as a characteristic example
—of the way in which museum authorities strive to incite the public to
a direct observation of nature. A. R. Wallace, the well-known Eng-
lish naturalist, as far back as 1869, described how a public museum for
the people should be constituted; but such an attempt, or even one
approximating it, has not yet been made anywhere, though much has
been said and written on the subject.

Departments for children.—In the large museums, a section may
generally be found specially adapted to the comprehension of children.
All, or nearly all, large libraries also have sections for children; thus,
for example, the Brooklyn Museum of Arts and Sciences,’ whose
children’s department was visited in the year 1902 by more than
84,000 children. This children’s museum publishes a small illustrated

monthly magazine, the Children’s Museum Bulletin, in which may be
found much elementary instruction. Instructive lectures, illustrated
by objects from the collections, are also given there for young teach-
ers of both sexes. The children’s library contains about 3,000 titles.
Similarly in the National Museum in Washington. This Museum is
under the direction of the celebrated Smithsonian Institution, which
was founded in 1846 ‘* for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men,” not alone, like our academies, for the advancement of
‘*science” in its more restricted sense. The Smithsonian Institution
is the most renowned scientific institution in the United States. Its
director, the noted physicist and astronomer, 5. P. Langley, though
not specially occupied with museum affairs, took personal charge of
the establishment of this children’s room in the great Museum and
worked out the details with loving care. All labels are worded in such
a way as to be readily understood by children. The object was to
develop the minds of the children and inspire them with a love for
nature, as had been proposed by Agassiz. This, it was thought, could
best be accomplished by withholding from them the confused mass of
objects to be found in a scientific collection, so that they might be
attracted and interested, but not oppressed and repelled. Langley
has admirably expressed himself upon this subject and with the humor
characteristic of Americans. “@

Prizes for school children.—Divect efforts are made to induce pupils
of both sexes to visit the museums by offering prizes for essays
adapted to the different classes. This custom has been carried on
especially at the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg, since 1896. The report
on the subject for the year 1902 occupies 41 pages.? At the last com-
petition 47 prizes of from five to twenty-five dollars were offered.
The subjects proposed were (1) bird life, as illustrated in the museum;
(2) minerals and gemstones in the museum; (3) why I like the Car-
negie Museum. No composition was to exceed 1,200 words in length.
The contest lasted four weeks. Even the teachers whose pupils show
the best training are suitably rewarded. Last year 813 children took
part in the contest. The award of prizes is always made the occasion
for a great popular gathering and resembles a kind of public jubilee.
The best two essays on bird life are printed in the above-named
report. They were submitted by boys 13 and 17 years of age. That
of the younger boy is particularly well done.

Lectures.—Great influence is exerted by public lectures. Twe
striking examples of this may be given. The American Museum of

Natural History in New York is divided into 12 departments. The
department of public instruction stands at the head of the list, a cir-
cumstance which indicates the main object of the museum. The director
of this department constantly keeps in stock, so to speak, 400 lectures on
200 different subjects. One series is especially prepared for teachers,
another for the general public, a third for members of the museum
and their families. A person may become a member by the annual
payment of $10. In the year 1902, 90 lectures were delivered before
27,000 persons.“ The Institute of Arts and Sciences in Brooklyn holds
annually more than 4,000 meetings with lectures, exhibitions, and
instruction for more than 250,000 persons.? <A considerable part of
these lectures and exhibitions devolves upon the museum of the insti-
tute which is established upon a very large scale. It would be a mis-
take to suppose that upon this account the scientific affairs of the
above-named museums are neglected. These are more in the hands
of other oflicials.

Popular publications.—Many museums publish guides and pam.
phlets on various subjects. In this respect again, the American Museum
of Natural History in New York takes the lead. We may recall, for
example, guides to the collection of birds, guides to the geological
‘and paleontological collection; also, a quarterly museum journal, in
which all news relating to the museum is published in popular form;
and, finally, pamphlets such as The Butterflies of New York and Vicin-
ity, The North American Ruminants, The Collection of Minerals, and
many others. All are profusely illustrated and thous: unds of copies
are sold at moderate prices.

Lending of collections.—In different museums, collections are lent
to public schools for educational purposes. For example, in the New
York Natural History Museum a large number of such collections of
50, 100, or more specimens each are laid aside and lent for varying
periods to the schools which apply for them. This is also done by the
New York State Museum at Albany and others. In the first-named
museum, school children with their teachers are allowed to study more
carefully certain reserve collections and even to handle the specimens.
Exceptional ability is, of course, required for the administration of
such establishments, but the American citizen now demands that the
museums make themselves useful in as many ways as possible, and
continually provide some incentive to observation and study.

Time of opening.—The American museums are almost universally
open daily from morning till evening, free of charge. On the other
hand, the number of custodians is small as compared with European
museums. The citizen of the U mited States rarely steals public prop-

erty, since he regards it as belonging to him personally, whereas here
in Germany, the authorities as proprietors antagonize the visitor, who
is treated more or less as an intruder, and deports himself in an unas-
suming manner.

From the foregoing it will be seen that the Americans assign a lead-
ing part in the activity of their museums to the exhibition collections,
which they arrange for wide circles of the educated, half-educated,
and uneducated classes. At the same time, they foster the interests
even of little children, and try to stimulate the older ones by offering
prizes; they make the museums contribute directly to the cause of
education by series of lectures, by popular publications, and by lend-
ing collections; and they keep the doors of their museums open to
everybody from morning till evening. How far all this could be
adapted to German conditions is a question which ought to be discussed
in a separate article.

I.—THE CITY OF NEW YORK.
[Population 3,440,000, or, including its surroundings, 4,000,000 inhabitants. ]
1. AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.

In comparison with other cities of the Union, New York was very
slow in organizing a natural history museum, but when, in the year
1869, it was decided to establish one, a project on the grandest scale of
all was adopted and collecting was immediately begun in a compre-
hensive way.

The building occupies a detached position alongside of Central Park
near great business streets, and has a richly molded fagade of red brick,
syenite, and granite, with towers, jutties, balconies, roofs, ete., in mod-
ern Romanesque style, approaching the French castle type, which was
introduced into England some decades ago. This style has flourished.in
the United States chiefly through the influence of the architect Rich-
ardson. The museum serves for anthropology, ethnography, arche-
ology, zoology, paleontology, geology, mineralogy, and botany. The
architects were, and still are, Vaux, Cady, Berg, and See. The inner
building, 183 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 101 feet high, the first to be
completed, was occupied in 1877. The existing collections were in the
meantime accommodated in the old arsenal in Central Park. The
height of the first floor is 18 feet; the second and third floors are
together 30 feet, consisting in reality of only one floor and a gallery,
the latter with a separate row of windows; the fourth floor 22 feet;
and the fifth, 16 feet. The dimensions of the halls are 85 by 85, 155
by 75, 172 by 90, and 183 by 65 feet. In America they still reckon
by feet, equal to 0.305 meter.

About one-sixth of the projected building is now erected. The
entire building when completed, which may not be for generations,

will occupy 13 acres,“ and will form a quadrangle with four courts,
each 213 feet square. A dome-like central tower 300 feet high is also
planned.’ The south side of this quadrangle, 750 feet long and 75 to
90 feet wide, was completed in 1899, in addition to the previously
built south arm of the central cross and the ground floor of the central
building, as mentioned, and forms a palace six to seven stories high,
including cellar and ground floor—from cellar to roof 127 feet high—
which has already cost, together with furniture, $2,800,000,° and
affords 148,000 square feet of exhibition space. The building and
furniture are paid for by the city by authority of the government of
the State of New York. The city also owns the ground. In the year
1900, $150,000 was available for continuing the construction of the
building. When the future completion of this enormous building is
considered it may well be asked whether so great a show museum for
natural history can still attain its objects.

The value of the existing collections is estimated at $2,800,000, and
the library contains about 44,000 volumes.“ The annual expenses of
$136,000 are borne by the city, under authority of the government
of the State of New York; wee of these expenses are made up of
salaries and wages. In the year 1899, $48,000 additional was raised
by private contribution. Of the 71 aunldrese 14 are scientists. A
president who serves without salary is at the head of the institution,
under a board of trustees of 24 members, mostly patrons of the
establishment. Together with the president, who is a layman, a
zoologist or paleontologist looks after the general scientific inter-
ests of the museum,’ which are discussed with the higher officials
as ina university faculty. The institution is divided into six ee
ments:/ (1) Public instruction; (2) geology, mineralogy, conchology
and marine invertebrates; (3) vertebrates; (4) vertebrate paleontolog ae
(5) anthropology (physical anthropology, archeology, und ethno og-
‘aphy); (6) entomology.

of the British Museum, which, however, now occupies only 8 acres with its buildings,
and as great as the ground area of the Natural History Museum in London, of which
only 4 acres are now occupied by the building itself, 675 feet long, or four times as
large as the old market in Dresden.

ot is still a question whether this will be erected. The towers of the Natural
History Museum in London are 192 feet high.

heate paleontology; (5) archeology; (6) ethnology; (7) mineralogy and conchology;

museum. It is under the
formal control of the regents
of the university of the State
of New York in Albany (see
under Albany). The work-
ing hours of the scientists
are from 9 or 10 a. m. to 5
p. m.; those of the other
employees, from 7 or 8 to 5.
For the increase of the col-
lections $95,000 is appropri-
ated annually, including the
cost of expeditions. This
sum is derived from private
contributions, $18,500 of
which is interest on a fund
thus established.

Besides this, about $10,000
are received from member-
ship fees, and $1,400 from
admission fees. In 1899 the
trustees expended $75,000 to
make good a deficit caused
by purchases. The museum
is open daily from 9 to 54

105 feet square, and accommodates 1,000 persons. A new lecture
room, 130 by 130 feet, designed to accommodate 1,500 persons, has
been completed. It is situated under the projected central tower.
These lectures were given by assistants in the museum, professors of
Columbia University in New York, and other scholars. There is a
more extensive series, intended especially for teachers, for which the
State of New York appropriates $12,000. The entire series of lectures
in 1899 was attended by more than 66,000 persons, of whom 13,500
were teachers. There are also evening receptions and exhibitions of
scientific societies.

The museum publishes annual reports (the thirty-first, for 1899, has
11 plates and 96 pages); octavo bulletins, with scientific papers and
plates, of which 12 volumes have appeared; and quarto memoirs, of
which 3 volumes are in print. There have also been published several
illustrated guides for certain departments; and an illustrated monthly,
The American Museum Journal, has been started. The museum
sends out series of scientific expeditions, which are constantly bringing
ina mass of fresh material, including valuable purchases. In the year
1899, 2 zoological, 3 paleontological, and 8 anthropological expeditions
were in progress. ‘These 8 expeditions, devoted to the anthropological,
archeological, and ethnographical researches in the country, added to
the museum 50,000 specimens.

The building is fireproof, of brick and iron, the floors being covered
with tile and marble mosaic. The furniture is of wood. There are
almost 20,000 lineal feet of cases and desks, for the increase of which
an additional $75,000 was available in 1900. The plant for heating,ven-
tilating, and lighting is now in the cellar, but is, however, to be removed
to one of the courts on account of the marked shaking of the building.
This will require an expenditure of $40,000. The heating is by steam.
Ventilators, driven by steam power, force fresh air through the shafts
into the building. Electricity and gas afford illumination. The rooms
in the cellar and garret are spacious and light. Broad, slate-covered
iron steps, in well-sighted staircases, lead from the bottom to the top
of the building, but are little used, since large electric elevators, with
a capacity of fifteen persons each, are constantly going up and down.
The architectural and color ornamentation of the interior is simple
throughout, often, one might say, scarcely present—a feature which
distinguishes this from many European museums in a most advanta-
geous manner. The painting of the interior is white or of a uniform
light color.

Since the buildings as they now stand were erected separately during
a period of over twenty-five years, something was necessarily gained
by experience. The newer parts are more perfect than the older,
and there can be no doubt that the remaining five-sixths of the
museum to be constructed will be still better; since in such a complex
mass of structures it is not necessary to maintain perfect uniformity in

the architectural details, slight departures are allowable from the gen-
eral style to avoid defects brought to light by experience. Some of the
newest rooms leave little to be desired with regard to dimensions, light,
and fittings, as also with regard to the electric illumination directly
from the ceiling. It may be strongly recommended that in other
similar buildings attention be paid to what has here been accomplished.

Each floor is provided with very long lines of fire hose, which are
connected with steam engines; moreover, portable fire extinguishers
are to be found everywhere.

The collections are still unequally developed, a fact which may be
explained by their recent acquisition. America, however, stands in
the foreground in regard to collections. Paleontology shows a certain
preponderance. North American mammals and reptiles are especially
well represented. The series showing the development of the horse
and the rhinoceros deserve especial attention, as also the giant reptiles—
for example, a gigantic plant-eating dinosaurian 62 feet long.“ Special

attention is paid tothe art of stuffing and mounting animals. Exam-
ples of this may be found in the great groups of the American elk and
bison, surrounded by artificial foliage and the like, in cases 32 feet long,
18 feet wide, and 14 feet high; and also in different groups of birds,
as for example, the pelicans. There are 55 such groups of birds and
20 of mammals displayed in as many separate cases, independent of the
systematic collection.

In a section of the local bird collection the residents are separated
from the migrants, and the latter are arranged in such a manner as to
show those occurring in the neighborhood in different months, an
arrangement that stimulates observation of nature. There are alto-
gether about 12,000 stuffed birds in the collection. Particular atten-
tion should be called also to the room devoted to North American
woods, especially to sections of the trunks, with the foliage, blossoms,
and fruits in water color. Almost every forest tree north of Mexico
is represented. The comprehensive collections of skeletons, displayed
on the fifth story in a long corridor lighted from above, are practical
and readily accessible. They lie in open, interchangeable, sliding
drawers in cases with glass doors, so that the contents are readily
accessible. The collections of 15,000 mammal skins and 70,060 bird
skins are kept in separate and well-closed tin cases of three different
sizes, standing one above another, with light, interchangeable sliding
trays—an arrangement to be recommended in case of lack of space.
Disinfection is accomplished by means of hot air (127° C.), and also by
bisulphide of carbon and by formalin.?

Of the ethnographic and prehistoric collections, the American series

“The first preparator, J. Rowley, has published a book on the subject, The Art
of Taxidermy (New York, D. Appleton & Co., 1898), in which may be found fur-
ther information regarding some special methods.

> Some additional details regarding the collections may be given here. In the pale-
ontological section are to be found the North American invertebrates of James Hall
(see also under Albany), with their many types, which were purchased in 1875 for
$70,000; the North American mammals, reptiles, amphibia, and fishes of E. D. Cope,
as well as his pampas mammals; the Terrell collection of fossil fishes from Ohio; a
fine series of moa skeletons, and the rich returns of the expeditions which the
museum sends out every year. Besides what has been mentioned, we may also refer
to the series of Titanotherium species and the Tylosaurus dyspelor (Cope), over 30 feet
long. The entomological section contains one of the foremost general collections of
insects in America, with about 400,000 specimens (Dresden has 280,000) and espe-
cially rich in types. The conchological section is conspicuous. The collection of
mammal and bird skins is limited almost entirely to America. It contains the
ornithological collections of Prince Max von Wied from Brazil, with many types;
that of G. N. Lawrence from North America, and D. G. Elliot’s collection of hum-
ming birds. The mineralogical section is very large and especially rich in jewels,
which were collected by G. F. Kunz, the mineralogist of the well-known New York
firm of Tiffany & Co., for the Paris Exposition of 1889. Another collection by the
same mineralogist has just been purchased from the recent Paris Exposition for
$50,000 and presented to the museum. [Mr. J. P. Morgan presented in 1901 the
celebrated Bement collection of minerals, worth $200,000.] Finally, special mention
may be made of a great collection of American building stones.

series, the latter particularly with regard to ornament and develop-
ment of style in the artistic manifestations of the Indian tribes. The
Mexican sculpture hall is equally rich and still more imposing. Here
are casts, some of them colored, of monoliths, stele, idols, altars, pil-
lars, walls, ete., of the ruins of Mexico and Central America, the origi-
nals of which still lie, with few exceptions, in the tropical thickets
among the remains of ancient temples. There are also original stone
sculptures from Copan and Yucatan, as well as ceramic and kindred
collections relating to ancient Central American civilizations. Among
these I may mention particularly the great series of nephrite, jadeite,
and chloromelanite specimens. “

«The finest and most comprehensive collection of such nephrite and jadeite from
all parts of the earth is in possession of H. R. Bishop, 881 Fifth avenue, New York,
who has prepared a great work concerning them; it cost $40,000 to prepare the illus-
trationsalone. In 1903, after the death of Mr. Bishop, this collection was incorporated
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which has thus acquired am ines-
timable treasure.

I add here a more detailed description of the ethnographic-archeological collection.

Two rooms on the first floor are devoted to ethnology, one on the second floor to
North American archeology, particularly collections from the Pueblo region; the
third floor (gallery) contains South American collections; the fourth, collections
from Mexico and Central America. Four additional rooms in the southwest corner
of the museum, which has just been completed, are to be devoted likewise to anthro-
pology; on the first floor a continuation of the ethnological collections; on the sec-
ond, of the collections of North American archeology; on the third, of the collections
of South American archeology; on the fourth, continuation of the Mexican collec-
tions. The ethnographic halls contain especially quite complete collections from the
North Pacific coast of America, from the Eskimos from northeast America, from the
islands of the Pacific Ocean, among them a series of old specimens in particularly
good condition from New Zealand, Hervey, Fiji, Samoa, ete. (such as may also be
found in Cambridge, Boston, and Salem), and excellent collections from Mexico.
Africa and Asia (excepting the Ainos) are as yet scarcely represented. [There have
since been received large collections from China.] The annual report for 1899 says,
on page 18, ‘‘Our collections from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and many of the
South Sea Islands are very poor.’’

The collections from the North Pacific coast depict the life in its different aspects.
A group of four figures of natural size shows the domestic life of the Indians of this
region, and at the same time the important part which the cedar plays in their
economy. Alongside of it the employment of natural products is represented.
Then comes a row of cases to represent the following categories: Art and industry
products, household utensils, travel and transportation, hunting and fishing, war,
clothing and ornaments, trade and exchange, music, decorative art, totemism, and
religious ideas In this row of cases are brought together the general characteristics
of the North Pacific culture. Then follow cases showing the particular characteristics
of the Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, Kwakiutl, Nutka, and the Salish tribes of British
Columbia and the State of Washington.

The collection is important for an understanding of the artistic style of the Indians,
particularly on account of the already well-explained objects from the North Pacific
coast, for an understanding of the basket making of the States of Washington and
California and of the style of ornaments of the Indians of the plains and western
Mexico, ete.

Toward the close of 1899 the Mexican sculpture room was opened, of which I have

It may be assumed with certainty that this museum will develop
during the twentieth century into one of the foremost natural history
institutions of the world; and its president, Morris K. Jesup, under
whose personal, self-sacrificing,” widely influential direction it has been
since 1881, is thereby setting up for himself a lasting monument.’

given an illustration in Plate II and plan on p. 335. It was described in Science, XI,
1900, p. 20, by F. W. Putnam, the head of the department (and also director of the
Peabody Museum of Archeology in Cambridge, Massachusetts). He considers this the
most important collection in existence for the study of ancient Mexican and Central
American civilization. I present herewith an abstract of his description.

Near the entrance the so-called ‘‘Great Turtle of Quiriqua’’ attracts attention.
Beside it stands the ‘‘ Dwarf,’’ the smallest of the stelee from the ruins of Quiriqua.
A cast of the largest of these monoliths, 25 feet high, is in the hall below. On the
right of the hall is a restoration of the sanctuary of the ‘‘Temple of the Cross,”’
in Palenque, showing the position of the bas-relief known as the ‘‘Tablet of the
Cross,’’ with the officiating priests and an hieroglyphic inscription. Attached is an
illustrated label explanatory of this temple. In the adjoining table case are several
pieces showing hieroglyphics and figures made in stucco, which was widely used.
The great ‘‘Calendar Stone,”’ the most remarkable of Mexican sculptures, is on the
south wall. On the opposite side of the hall are many fine bas-reliefs from ruins in
Guatemala, Honduras, Palenque, and Yucatan. Overa case at the east end of the
hall is a group of slabs from Palenque upon which are many columns of hieroglyphs.
Near by are casts of slabs from the ruins of Chichen Itza in Yucatan, also sculptured
stone posts of a doorway, upon which rests a carved wooden lintel. To the right of
this is shown the sculptured wall of a portion of a room in a temple at Chichen Itza,
on which are many human figures and a feathered serpent. There is evidence that
this and many of the other sculptures were formerly painted in several colors, of
which red, yellow, and blue predominated, as, for instance, the statue of Chac-Mools
from Chichen Itza. i

There are also on exhibition Tarascan terra cotta figures and stone sculptures,
original sculptures in stone from Copan and Yucatan, pottery from the ruins of Casas
Grandes, illustrating a culture approaching that of the ancient Pueblo people of
Arizona and New Mexico; and also jadeite ornaments, copper implements and orna-
ments, carved stone yokes, a large terra cotta human figure, and pottery vessels of
many forms, all illustrative of the culture’of several of the ancient Mexican peoples.
There are collections made by Doctor Seler in Mexico and Guatemala, and valuable
ter.a cotta figures found in a mound at Xoxo, a cast of the inscribed stone lintel of
the door of this tomb, and many vessels and skeletons. Finally, in a center case
are various facsimiles of Mexican and Maya manuscripts in European collections.
Compare also Ehrenreich’s statements of the year 1898, regarding this department of
the New York Museum in Zeitschrift fiir Ethnologie, 1900, pages 4-8, with three
figures. (Seealso, opening of the anthropological collection in the American Museum
of Natural History, Science, 1900, pp. 720-722.—1903. )

“Tn the year 1899 alone, Mr. Jesup gave $30,000 to the museum. In the course
of almost twenty years, during which he has officiated as president, he has expended
enormous sums on it. The Berlin Geographical Society recently made him an
honorary member in recognition of his services for the advancement of the sciences.
He is at the same time still actively engaged in the banking business.

»In conelusion, let me add a few more detailed remarks: :

The orientation of the entire building would have been more favorable if its diago-
nal had been turned on its central point about 11 degrees, so that the facade, now
completed, would face toward the southwest instead of toward the south-southwest.

2. MUSEUM OF THE BROOKLYN INSTITUTE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES.

Brooklyn, with more than 1,250,000 inhabitants, has formed part of
Greater New York since 1897. The Brooklyn Institute of Arts and
Sciences dates from 1824, and received its present name in 1887. Its
principal aim is the diffusion of knowledge by means of lectures,
instruction, and museum collections. Its motto is from Washington’s
celebrated farewell address: .‘‘ Promote as an object of primary

In that case the long side would be less exposed to the direct rays of the sun. It
would then have been unnecessary constantly to protect the collections on exhibition
by window curtains, which, under the direct rays of the sun, change the proper color
of the objects and make conditions for exhibition unsuitable. This fact is usually
lost sight of in connection with museum buildings, to the disadvantage of the collec-
tions installed in them. In the case under consideration the lines of the existing
streets were followed. The unconformity which would have occurred by a slight
turning of the building could, however, have been masked by planting groups of trees
and the like. The building is massive and imposing, with a rich moulding, added
solely with a view to architectural effect. The arrangement of individual rooms
resulting from it is in many cases unsuited. As is very often the case with muse-
ums, this one was not built solely with reference to its needs; that is, constructed
from within outward and the outer form of the building made to conform to the inte-
rior design. Thus, for example, the great projecting central part of the building
darkens the halls lying behind it; the projecting towers produce inconsistency and
irregularity ina number of the inner rooms; the crossbars of the windows and the
window posts are too wide, and thereby unnecessarily reduce the light in the interior;
in certain stories the windows themselves ought to have been higher and not extended
down as far as the floor, for, had this been the case, the only advantageous method
of lighting, by upper side light, ete., would have been secured.

The proportions of length, breadth, and height of some halls, and the width of the
spaces between windows in relation to the width of the windows, are often extremely
well worked out, so that individual portions of the museum, rather than the whole
building, make the best impression.

The furniture, cases, and desks are of wood, with heavy framework, generally with
many crossbars and relatively small panes, and they are not dust proof, except in the
large show cases without doors. It is the more astonishing that they have not intro-
duced iron cases, such as are to be found in many European museums, since Americe
is far in advance of Europe in fitting out libraries and archives with iron furniture, and
understands how to install it ina more perfect manner than we have yet attained.
Objection may also be made to the dimensions and to the peculiar shape and the
position of many of the cases with regard to the source of light. Too little regard
has been paid to the architecture in its bearings upon the lighting arrangements;
thus several of the fine large groups of animals (the bisons, among others) are con-
siderably injured by reflections from the glass panes, which are distributed carelessly
without consideration of the source of hight. This, however, could easily be remedied.
For the sizes of the cases and their distribution, it would have been more advantageous
if the iron-supporting columns had stood farther toward the middle of the halls.
These columns also run directly into the ceiling. The richly ornamented capitals
in some halls do not harmonize with the prevailing simplicity of the interior decora-
tions which in a great degree are worthy of imitation, except that in some of the
older parts of the building they are too rough.

I have already mentioned that the number of scientific workers employed in this
museum, which is advancing with giant strides, 1s entirely inadequate. The mass

importance institutions for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”
The society which composes the institute has about 6,000 members,”
who pay $5 entrance fee and annual dues, and is divided into 27
scientific and artistic sections, which meet in different buildings. At
the head is a president with a board of 52 trustees and 11 different
committees. The members also are organized into a council and §
committees. The whole establishment is under the nominal control of
the University of the State of New York (see under Albany). It

of material which is continually flowing in from the many expeditions, donations,
and purchases, can not be properly attended to nor scientifically treated. The
employees are therefore overburdened, an evil which I encountered in many of the
American museums. Their outward splendors are out of proportion to the number
and position of the scientists employed in them. The relatively small salaries usual in
the United States, the instability of the positions (even under political influence ),
and the absence of the pension system contrast unfavorably with the conditions pre-
vailing in Europe, where museums are better regulated and the positions more secure,
and are more in consonance with the principles of fairness. Certainly museum
employees do not command the same respect and enjoy the same rights in the Union
as in the Old World. The employee is at a disadvantage against the influential
powers who furnish to the museums the means of existence, is too much dependent
upon them, and too much restrained in his rights. So much the more worthy of
unstinted admiration are the idealism and the splendid achievements of many scien-
tific men working under uniavorable conditions.

The lack of a central expert administration in the New York Museum [a director
has since been nominated.—1903] is evident from the fact that all possible colors of
backgrounds and labels are met with, as well as greatly varied methods of mounting,
which are by no means all worthy of imitation.

The animal groups are excellently mounted. The accessories of leaves and flowers
are carefully cast in wax and consequently transparent and very true to nature, but
somewhat obtrusive. There is too much of this good work, for the attention is diverted
from the object of the exhibition. 5

The manner of preserving the great skin collection in single tin boxes, with light
trays of wood and pasteboard piled high one upon another, is inconvenient in the
narrow rooms in which they are kept, although these boxes, whose lids can be taken
off or tightly fastened with bolts, may in themselves be very practical. These trays
are disinfected with bisulphide of carbon, which must often be renewed, and can be
neither agreeable nor wholesome for the employees.

The butterflies of the exhibition collection are displayed in desks in a peculiar
way, each specimen in a little pasteboard box by itself, covered with glass, on athin
gypsum plate adapted to its form—an arrangement which requires much space and
produces, on the whole, a monotonous effect, however pretty each specimen may
look. On page 32 of the Annual Report for 1899 there is an illustration of such a
clumsy butterfly case. The makers of this method of preparation, Denton Brothers,
of Wellesley, Mass., received at the Paris Exposition of 1900, a gold medal for their
‘collection and preservation of butterflies.’

I do not, however, wish to be misunderstood. The American Museum of Natural
History offers something quite extraordinary and stands relatively upon a very high
plane, so that one not only may, but willingly does, overlook minor defects. Besides,
what museum can be called faultless. I am convinced that this magnificently
founded institution, in its further development, will in every respect be worth
imitating.

maintains also a biological laboratory on the seashore, with 12 employ-
ees, as well as a larger museum for children in Bedford Park, the
latter with 3 employees, one of whom is a naturalist. The art build-
ing on Montague street, worth about $125,000, stands financially and
otherwise in close relation to the institute. The library includes
27,000 volumes. ’ From June 1, 1898, to May 31, 1899, 3,806 meetings
were held, including lectures, demonstrations, and class reunions,
which were attended by over 360,000 persons. The Institute has an
invested fund of over $250,000, and an annual income of $175,000.

“The museum for children is designed for young people from 6 to 20 years of age,
and includes all human endeavors and interests, so far as they are comprehensive for
youth or can serve for their education. The objects chosen all bear a definite rela-
tion to home life and school life. In 6 rooms on the basement floor are collections
of models, animals, plants, anatomical preparations and meteorological instruments,
as well as a lecture room which will accommodate 40. On the first floor are the
library and administration rooms. The rooms are prettily decorated, and the cases
are low enough to enable children to see everything well. Many things are here
brought together which are of interest also to grown persons. I may mention a
so-called type collection, such as is used in elementary schools in France. It con-

Not until 1890 did the Institute begin the founding of a museum.
The cost of building and furnishing is borne by the city. Though
not quite as large as the Natural History Museum in New York, it is
planned on a great scale. The building ground is at the southwestern
end of Brooklyn, on Prospect Hill, 175 feet in height, in an extensive
partly-wild park of the same name, where 12 acres of land (750 by 725
feet) are reserved by the city for the museum. The collections com-
prise the arts and sciences. It is proposed to construct a square
building in the renaissance style, with cupolas, facing almost exactly

area of 7 acres, or more than twice the size of the old market in Dres-

tains 35 minerals, 20 plants, 13 fossils, 3 worms, 3 echinoderms, 2 crabs, 90 insects,
10 mollusks, 2 fishes, 3 reptiles, 3 birds, and 2 mammals—altogether 186 specimens,
and costs $20 in France. Further, as an example of how things are demonstrated to
the children, to represent the leather industry there is shown a piece of animal hide,
the different substances for tanning and dyeing, and also the bristles used in the
manufacture of brushes. Or else, on a map of France, the wine districts are desig-
nated by small wine bottles, the coal districts by fragments of coal, the distribution
of navigation by miniature metal ships, that of glass manufactures by little pieces of
glass, etc. Nine hundred pictures and tableaus are hung up in succession. School
teachers can also use the material of the collection in lectures to their pupils.

den. It will have four covered courts and three stories, exclusive of
the basement, and in the central axis a fourth floor, the upper stories
with skylights. Surrounding it isan open space 125 feet wide, reserved
for greens and shrubs. (An exact plan of the whole building may be
found in the eleventh Yearbook of the Institute, 1899, page 389.) The
architects are McKim, Mead & White.

The foundation was laid in 1895, and in 1897 the first portion, the
right wing of the north section, was completed (with exception of the
statues of the chief frieze). This wing is 193 feet long, 43 by 64 feet
wide, and 95 feet high (above ground). It is fireproof throughout,
excepting afew wooden window frames on the ground floor (all others
of iron), and a few oaken doors. The floors are supported by iron

beams and brick arches and are covered with terrazzo on a cement
foundation. The facade is of white sandstone, harmoniously wrought.
This portion cost, with furnishings, about $375,000, and represents
about one-thirtieth of the entire building. The erection of the central
building of the north side of the main portal has been begun,¢ for
which $300,000 have been appropriated by the city. The collections
are enlarged exclusively by donations. A learned director (at present
a paleontologist) is at the head of the museum, which has 17 employees,
7 of whom are scientists,’ and several honorary administrators of indi-

vidual sections with their subordinates. The working hours are from
9 to 6 on week days and the afternoon of Sunday; there is a weekly
half holiday. The number of visitors in 1898-99 was about 93,000.
Admission is free on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday, even when these are holidays; on Wednesday and Saturday
from 9 to 6; Thursday and Friday from 7.30 a. m. to 7.45 p. m., and
Sunday from 2 to6 p.m. On Monday and Tuesday from 9 to 6 there
is an admission fee of 25 cents; children under 16 years, 10 cents, and
children under 14 years are only admitted when accompanied by a
grown person. Umbrellas and canes are checked free, voluntary gifts
for this service not being customary. The Institute publishes an
illustrated Yearbook (the eleventh for 1898-99 has 422 pages), as well
as an annual prospectus, which contains reliable information regard-
ing the lectures, demonstrations, and instruction. The prospectus for
1899-1900 contained 181 pages. The museum has as yet published
only one catalogue of paintings (in two editions, 1898 and 1900), and
an illustrated catalogue of the Goodyear collection of photographs of
Italian architecture and sculpture (1896), which were taken on one
of the museum expeditions (1895).¢ Other scientific expeditions are
projected.

The distribution of space and the lighting of the portion of the
building now standing are excellent.’ As in the Natural History
Museum in New York, the halls are almost without ornament. The
walls and ceilings are white or of a uniform color, the lobbies and
staircase light gray. This deserves special mention because the
collections of so many museums, at least in Europe, are rather
injured than benefitéd by too much decoration, or by the style of the
decoration of the galleries. The engines for heating, ventilating,
lighting, and electric power are located in the basement, and cause a
shaking in certain portions of the building. The steam radiators
are placed mostly under the windows or near them. A hot-air plant,
besides, run by the steam engine, heats all the halls through openings
about two-thirds above the floors. Ventilation is accomplished by
means of an electric ventilator in the root, but this does not seem
free from objections. The problem is seldom well solved in large
buildings. In the axis of a well-lighted, spacious, spiral staircase
(iron steps overlaid with slate) an electric elevator runs to the roof,
from which, on account of the high situation of the building, may be
enjoyed a fine, extensive view, with the Botanical Gardens and Pros-
pect Park in the foreground. The basement is 25 feet high and con-

tains exhibition rooms, administrative rooms, and machinery rooms.
Each of the three floors contains four halls for collections—one 110

is 29 feet high, the second, 22 feet; the third, with skylight, 24 feet.¢
All may be brightly lighted by electricity. Hand fire extinguishers
are found on each floor, and on the ground floor a line of hose 150
feet long. i

The basement contains a geographical collection, with many maps.
The hall in which this is kept is plainly furnished and well lighted
from both sides. The walls are light green, the ceiling white, and the
floor of dark cement.

The first story is devoted to sculpture. The great hall, where are
found Greek and Roman statuary, is excellently lighted from the
north side by means of upper side windows. The white casts are
tastefully mounted on dark green pedestals against a light olive-green
background. The ceiling is white, the window frames are a very

invite the visitor to prolong his stay. In this section is the magnifi-
cent collection of Italian photographs of Professor Goodyear.

The second floor is devoted to natural history and prehistoric objects
with special reference to America. The large hall is lighted excel-
lently from both sides except when the sun shines in from the south.
The cases stand at right angles to the wall spaces between the windows,
by which the best possible effect of lighting is attained. The walls
are cream colored, the ceiling white, and the window frames ocher. “

The paintings are on the third floor (lighted from aboye), most of
them provisionally loaned. The great gallery is not yet overtfilled,
and is furnished with comfortable benches. The walls are light
Pompeian red, the ceiling white. Picture galleries are seldom seen in
which the examination of the works of art are so little disturbed by
the surroundings. The collection is, for an American collection, rich
in landscapes of the seventeenth century and other works of the old
masters, as also in pictures of the French school of 1830. I give in
alphabetical order the names of the artists who are represented by
more noteworthy paintings: Corot (+), Cortese (2), Courbet (8), Cuyp,
Daubigny (3), Decamps (3), Diaz (5), Dupré (3), Etty (2), Fyt, Gains-
horough (2), Géricault (2), V. Goyen (2), Hals, Hobbema, Lorrain,
Marilhat, J. Maris (3), W. Maris (2), Mauve (7), Metsu, Michel (3),
V. Mieris, Millet, Morland (3), Pannini (3), Rembrandt, De Reyn,
Rosa (3), Rousseau (3), Ryckaert, Stork, J. Vernet (3), Vollon (2),
Wilkie, Wilson (3).

The collections, noteworthy as they already are, may still be regarded
merely as a beginning of much greater achievements. One might well
wish to live to see the completion of the entire building, since it
promises to be a highly creditable accomplishment, and the devotion
of the citizens of this rich city guarantees that the museum will not
lack good collections.

«The cases are of wood, with clumsy framework, not meeting the present require-
ments (see remarks on the American Museum of Natural History, p. 338, footnote.)
In a building where everything is fireproof—which even has iron window frames,
something very hard to find anywhere else—it is strange that the kindred idea of
introducing iron furniture did not occur to the builders.

The collection is still unequally developed. We may make special mention of the
butterfly collection of nearly 100,000 specimens, with more than 1,200 types (the
Dresden Museum has about 40,000 specimens, including about 8,000 species). No
special care has as yet been bestowed upon the methods ot exhibition.

end, of furnishing popular instruction and recreation,” the Metropoli-
tan Museum of Art has been planned, to occupy several detached
buildings covering more than 18 acres of ground in Central Park,
about half a mile from the Natural History Museum. Up to the
present one building has been completed.“ It is 345 feet long, 325
feet wide, and between 1876 and 1898 was erected in four sections
by the elder Hunt on sloping, and, partly for that reason, deep-lying
eround. It has four courts, a cellar, ground floor, and one additional
story, and is constructed of red brick with gray granite trimmings,
which looks very attractive, particularly in summer when the park is
ereen. The older portion is in Italian gothic, the newer in renaissance
style. The principal entrance is on one of the narrow sides. The cost
amounts to $500,000, with $65,000 additional for interior furnishings
and $90,000 for the power house. ‘There is, besides, an imposing fire-
proof building of gray sandstone in the best renaissance style, 305 feet
long, 103 feet wide, and 88 feet high, connected with the former on its
rear side by a middle wing 107 feet long and 64 feet wide. This build-
ing was not finished, however, at the time of my visit.” The architect
of the new building is the younger Hunt. It cost $1,000,000; the
interior furnishings and the power house $220,000 additional. The
city donated the ground and also, by authority of the government
of the State of New York at Albany, bears the cost of building and
makes an annual appropriation of $100,000 for the running expenses.
These amount to about $130,000, of which $90,000 go for salaries and
wages. The balance is paid by the corporation that founded the
museum in 1870, from the interest on its funds, which amount to
$580,000,¢ and from private donations and special sources of income,
such as annual dues (about $20,000 from 2,000 members at $10),
entrance fees (on two days of the week, $5,000), sales of catalogues
($3,000), ete.

Until 1879 the collections were stored, one after another, in two
private houses. Patrons gave, and continue to give, the means for
purchases, and donations and bequests were received in such profusion
that the large halls of the present museum, comprising together
almost 3% acres of space, were overcrowded after the, first twenty
years. They are now relieved by the removal of a portion of their
contents to the new building, and the great hall of the latter is to be
devoted specially to sculpture. The library has over 6,000 volumes.
The value of the collections is estimated at more than $9,000,000. The
building is open on week days from 10 to 6, Monday and Friday for
nonmembers at an admission fee of 25 Hen also on Wese two oe:

shorter days the building is closed before sundown. Children under
7 years are admitted only when accompanied by grown persons. Copy-
ing is allowed only on Mondays and Fridays. The number of visi-
tors in 1899 was 540,000, of whom about 200,000 came on Sundays.
Entire schools of 300 pupils often come and pene the whole day in

The center of the building is occupied by a large hall with skylight
and galleries. In its four corners are somewhat narrow and steep
wooden staircases, running to the second floor and to the cellar. In
the latter are located a restaurant, and other conveniences. In the
halls of the ground floor the windows are placed so high that cases
can stand against the walls beneath them, an arrangement that looks
well, but which does not appear everywhere to answer the purpose on
account of the reflections and the deficiency of light. The floor is of
white marble. Almost the whole second story is unsatisfactorily
lighted by skylights, and in the picture galleries the light is further
impaired by the plate glass, with which all the pictures are covered.
The floor is made of parquetry, with an underlayer of cement one foot
thick in the picture galleries as a protection against fire. In the sum-
mer the ventilation seemed insufficient. All the rooms can be lighted
by electricity. The heating is by steam. The power house is located
in a separate building.

In the middle hall is displayed a collection of casts and models of
antique and medieval architecture—among them, on a large scale, the
Pantheon, Parthenon, Temple of Karnak, Notre Dame (this model cost
$20.000), Guild of the Butchers’ House in Hildesheim, and many others,
mostly with single parts of natural size beside them, and in every case
photographs of the whole. In the other halls of the ground floor the
collections from the Cyprian excavations are specially important.
These demonstrate the Oriental influence on Greco-Roman art in
vases, terra cottas, glasses, great stone sculptures, bronzes, etc. This
most complete provincial collection shows in series the transitions from
the prehistoric time, 1,200 years B. C. and earlier, to the Roman and
Christian period of the fifth century, and is consequently very instruct-
ive. It cost $60,000. A precious collection of glasses from the most
remote times to the present also deserve particular mention.

On the second floor the modern portion of the picture gallery is
first to claim the attention. <A collection of equal value is not to be
found in Europe. Only the following names need be mentioned:
The two Achenbachs, Bastien-Lepage, Benjamin-Constant, Rosa Bon-
heur (Horse Market—which cost $60,000 and was a gift to the
Museum—and others), Bonnat, Bouguereau, Breton, Cabanel, Corot,

classified by the schools of art represented because individual collections
must remain intact in accordance with testamentary provisions. The
systematic arrangement of such collections is rightly considered as of
less importance than their acquisition. Frequently, also, large sums
‘are bequeathed for their preservation. In the other halls of the
second story may also be noted the great collection of musical instru-
ments of all peoples and periods (concerning which a profusely illus-
trated work by M. E. and W. A. Brown appeared in 1888),“ the
ceramic collection, particularly from China and Japan, as also the
Cyprian gold ornaments on exhibition in a room, which includes only
precious articles of every kind.

A practical contrivance, which enables one to look through a series
of volumes of photographs without exposing them to injury, should
be mentioned. The books lie in glass desks, and when one wishes to
turn over the separate leaves it is necessary to reach through an opening

in front, which may be closed by means of a slide. A catalogue of
the photographic collection may also be used in like manner.

The value of this Museum (I have only laid stress upon a portion of
it) is, notwithstanding its youth, very great, and its further develop-
ment will be still more remarkable, as more objects of art are constantly
flowing into the New World from the Old; so, in studying the art
history of Europe and Asia, the collections of the United States may
not in the future be overlooked.’

“Two catalogues of this collection have since been published, with illustrations.

’ We may here add some remarks which could not be so well embodied in the
text:

The buildings lie in about the same direction as the Natural History Museum.
The new building did not appear to me to be very happily joined to the old one. In
the old building the entrance of the light through the windows is unnecessarily
obstructed by the division of the windows into two parts and their shaded interior
position. The exhibition in the great middle hall gives an unpleasant impression,

4. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY—ASTOR, LENOX, AND TILDEN
FOUNDATIONS.

This library originated in 1895 by combining the Astor Library,
which was founded in 1849 and opened in 1854, and the Lenox
Library, which was founded in 1870 and opened in 1878, with the
Tilden bequest (1887) of $2,100,000 and 20,000 volumes for a public
library. From plans drawn by Carrére and Hastings there is now
- being erected in the best part of the city (Fifth avenue) a magnificent,
monumental building, which is to be completed in about four years,
at a cost of $2,000,000 to be paid by the city through authority of
the government of the State of New York in Albany. Five hundred
thousand dollars were made available for the purpose in 1899 as a first
instalment. As the two libraries named will soon disappear as such,
only a few remarks concerning them will suffice.

The Astor Library, in Lafayette place, near the busiest portion of
the principal street (Broadway), is supported by the bequests and
donations of the Astor family, amounting to $1,750,000. It is located
ina two-story (in the middle portion three-story) building of red brick
in Romanesque style, 200 feet long and 100 feet wide, which was built
in three sections between 1853 and 1881. The Tilden Library is also
installed here. The library consists of about 350,000 volumes, most
of them of rather a general character, and 100,000 pamphlets, besides
incunabula, manuscripts, and autographs. One peculiarity is note-
worthy, that the books, arranged on the shelves according to subjects,
are. accessible to the public with certain limitations; but at present this

especially on account of the arched ceiling, like that of a railroad station, which is
not relieved by the decorations. The unsystematic arrangement and the incomplete-
ness of the collections is fully explained by their newness. Considering the magnifi-
cence of the collections it would be ungracious to dwell upon their faults, particularly
as these objectionable conditions are improving from day to day. I mention the lack
of good arrangement because it may partly be explained from the fact that many gifts
have to be accepted and placed on exhibition in order not to lose patronage—an evil
which is met with in many American museums. Such elements as do not fit in a col-
lection can only be culled out after the lapse of many years.

The importance of the comprehensive and celebrated Cyprian collection can not
be fully appreciated on account of its unscientific arrangement. The finds are sep-
arated (they probably were never kept together) and there exists no chronological
sequence at all. The Oriental, Grecian, and Cyprian types in the vases, terra cottas,
glasses, and stone sculptures are everywhere mixed together. Unfortunately no
information whatever is given the visitor by labels. - He does not get much more from
the handbooks, since these are limited to brief descriptions. They are, indeed,
welcome but not sufficient for an understanding of such objects. One must, there-
fore, regret not being able to derive the full benefit from this fine collection, even
after several visits, which it should be capable of affording. The unsystematic
arrangement of the collection is also particularly striking in the room on the second
story devoted to precious ornaments. On the other hand, care has been bestowed
upon harmony of arrangement in the entire museum, so that the general inipression
produced is one of pleasure and grandeur.

privilege is somewhat restricted on account of the overcrowded con-
dition of the library. It may further be remarked that the newest
acquisitions are placed together on a bookstand, and are freely acces-
sible to readers. The furniture is of wood. Only a few iron shutters
and fire extinguishers serve as a protection against fire. It is open
daily, except Sundays and holidays, from 9 to 6, and is lighted at dusk
by electricity. Children under 15 years of age are admitted when

free of charge. Fees for this service are not expected. Books can
be examined only in the library itself. There are 219 seats, a certain
portion of one of the three great reading halls being reserved for
ladies. From July 1, 1898, to June 30, 1899, 358,000 volumes were
used by 85,000 readers (an average of 247 daily), apart from the refer-
ence library of 4,500 volumes, which is freely accessible to everybody

About 100 persons are employed in the library. It has published a
few annual reports, several indexes and lists, and eight volumes of a
catalogue with supplement (1861 to 1888), which, however, extends
only as late as 1880.

The Lenox Library occupies a detached position in the best part of
the city on Fifth avenue opposite Central Park. It contains also col-
lections of different sorts. It is of two stories, fireproof, of white
sandstone, with two one-story wings projecting at right angles. In
the style of the Ecole des Beaux Arts, it is recognized as one of the
best specimens of later Parisian architecture, being of imposing
appearance within and without, with the exception of the great coy-
ered steps leading to the entrance. The book stacks are of iron.

The library contains 150,000 volumes, particularly Americana, Bibles
(10,000 volumes), Shakespeareana, and music, besides about 75,000
pamphlets, 600 manuscript volumes, 600 volumes of incunabula, 50,000
letters, 4,000 maps, etc. Nothing is lent out. There are 25 employees.
The visiting hours, ete., are the same as in the Astor Library. After
dusk the library is lighted by electricity and open to visitors. There
are 108 seats. In 1898-99, 68,000 volumes were used by 26,000 readers

of 5,000 volumes in two reading rooms. Only two books were stolen
and 25 mutilated in the two libraries together.

On the second floor there is a gallery of 400 paintings, for the most
part modern—among them works by Becker, Bierstadt, Rosa Bonheur,
Bouguereau, Brozik, Church, Constable, Copley, Corot, Delaroche,

Meissonier, Munkacsy, Pine, Reynolds, Schreyer, Stuart, Troyon,
Turner, Verboekhoven, H. Vernet, Vibert, and Wilkie. There is also
a small collection of statuary and prints; and, finally, some minerals,
ceramics, glass, etc., in wooden cases. The number of visitors to the
museum was 34,000.¢

The Lenox Library published or printed between 1879 and 1893,
seven Contributions to a Catalogue of the following contents: The
Hulsius collections of voyages; the Jesuit relations; the voyages of
Thévenot; the Bunyan, Shakespeare, Milton, and Walton collections;
also the letter of Columbus on the discovery of America (1492), as
well as catalogues of paintings of the Lenox and Stuart collections,
and twelve short title lists.

The new library, which embraces the two just described and the Lenox
collection, and has been administered as the new library since 1896, is
controlled by a director, under a board of trustees of 21 members,
with a president at its head, and also 5 committees, nominally con-
trolled by the University of the State of New York. (See Albany.)
All the following applies to the Astor, Lenox, and Tilden libraries
together. The New York Public Library will soon be increased by a
great distribution section, which will include all the public libraries
belonging to the city. New York has too long been without such a
central library. More than 600,000 books and pamphlets are now
accessible and about 75,000 are not yet installed.’ In 1899 more than
115,000 readers called for over 500,000 volumes, without including
the reference library—an average of 347 readers daily. In the year
named the extraordinarily large increase of almost 165,000 volumes
and pamphlets was recorded. The average annual increase is now
estimated at over 50,000 numbers; 3,925 periodicals were received,’ of
which 1,207 were American and 909 German; 819 of these were dona-
tions. There were 148,000 parts of periodicals consulted during last
year, an average of more than 500 daily.? The annual increase
amounts to 6,400 numbers, including 48 dailies, 543 weeklies, 1,075
monthly and 580 yearly papers.“ All of these are purchased. In 1899
more than 91,000 volumes and pamphlets were catalogued on 225,000
ecards. The catalogue of the reading room, accessible to all, contains

“New York has three public picture galleries: Those of the Metropolitan Museum,
Brooklyn Institute, and Lenox Library. Of prominent private galleries I may
mention those of C. T. Yerkes, H. O. Havemeyer, G. W. Vanderbilt, G. Gould,
and W. A. Clark.

bIn 1902 there were 777,768 books and pamphlets in the library. The Berlin
Library has over 1,000,000 volumes and manuscripts, the Paris Library nearly
3,000,000, the British Museum from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000.

¢In 1902, 4,495.

“In 1902, 226,396 current periodicals were called for, being a daily average of 750.

€ In 1902 the average of separate numbers of periodicals (excluding annuals ) received
daily was 280, the total number for the year being 86,800.

up to the present 600,000 cards, with author and subject entries in
alphabetical sequence. The author and subject catalogue now includes
only half of the library. Two hundred thousand volumes and pam-
phlets are covered by an author catalogue only, while 50,000 are
still uncatalooued. The catalogue system is new and will be published
later. The library now makes a specialty of official publications of
governments and public administrations of all countries, as well as

everything relating to societies. A monthly bulletin, the fourth
volume of which is in course of publication, which annually amounts
to 500 pages, gives an account of what is done in the library, specifies
monthly the most important acquisitions, contains bibliographies,
copies of documents and letters, etc. A handbook of 64 pages
nee to the New York Public Library was recently published
(1900). ‘Tolerably full instruction in library science is also given.
With so comprehensive a programme, such lofty aims, and consider-

ing the inclination of the Americans toward greatness, it need scarcely
be said that the new building has been planned ona corresponding scale.
It is about 350 feet long, 250 feet wide, 68 feet high in front, 98 feet
in the rear (that is, about the size of the German Reichstag building),
with two open courts, each 81 feet square. It consists of three stories
and a basement, connected with one another by elevators and stairs.
It is fireproof throughout. This library differs from many others in
not having the main reading room situated centrally in a lofty,
spacious hall, as is generally the case, but in the back part of the
topmost story, occupying, in several sections, almost the entire length
of the building.” It is also noteworthy by having the iron book-
stacks, seven stories high, located under this main reading room,
beginning in the basement. They are 270 feet long, 72 feet wide,
and altogether 53 feet high, affording space for 1,250,000 volumes,
while another quarter of a million can be provided for elsewhere.
The delivery desk for these is located in the middle of the main
reading rooms, connected with the underlying bookstacks by means
of book lifts. The rooms for lending books outside of the building
are situated in one of the courts in the basement and ground floor.
A possible extension of the library to a capacity for 5,000,000 volumes
is provided for by the park lying behind the building. There will be
about 800 seats in the main reading room, besides about six special
study rooms in the third story and seats in the special libraries (Gov-
ernment publications, Oriental literature, sociology and political econ-
omy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, maps, music, Bibles). There is
also a reading room for children and a newspaper and periodical room
in the second story. The whole manuscript section is asa safe for
itself. The power plant will be located outside of the building. The
other details may be seen in the ground plans.

The land, buildings, and books of the united libraries are worth
about $3,600,000. There is, besides, an invested fund of $3,000,000,
yielding $125,000 interest, seven-eighths of which is applied to
administrative purposes. After the completion of the new building,
however, ample provision will be made by the city for running
expenses.”

There can be no doubt that the New York Public Library, under the
administration of Dr. John S. Billings, who has been director since
1896, will become a model institution, and, supported by the liberality
of the rich New Yorkers, it will be a magnificent ornament to the
great city.

«This is also the case in the Chicago Public Library.

bSince Mr. Carnegie has, in 1901, presented $5,200,000 for 65 branch libraries in
New York, the task of the public library has been enormously increased, as they are
all to be under the administration of the New York Public Library. Already, in
1902, 2,000,000 books were in circulation for home use from 17 branch libraries.
358 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.
5. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

The founding of King’s College by royal patent of George II dates
back to 1754—before the Declaration of Independence of the United
States of America, in 1776; therefore the university is one of the
oldest organizations in New York. In 1897 it was removed to Morn-
ingside Heights, in the northern part of the city, between One hun-
dred and sixteenth and One hundred and twentieth streets and Tenth
and Eleventh avenues, except that the medical faculty (College of
Physicians and Surgeons, founded in 1807), and incorporated in 1891,
remained in its three buildings in Fifty-ninth street, 3 miles away where
it had in 1887 acquired model new buildings and furnishings, pro-
vided almost entirely by the Vanderbilt family at a cost of $2,500,000,
among them an anatomical laboratory for 400 students, a model of its
kind. I here treat only of the new university, which was erected in a
uniform style from maturely considered plans, and, besides many
other advantages, already before completion, possesses two especial
attractions—the power house and the library. The university occu-
pies its third location since it was founded as King’s College, almost
one hundred and fifty years ago, and the medical faculty its sixth.
This frequent removal might at first sight appear to be a disadvan-
tage, but has in fact proven to be a great advantage, because, pushed
farther and farther outward by the growth of the city, the new build-
ings could in their new locality always be made to conform to the
altered conditions, whereas elsewhere such new buildings can gener-
ally be acquired only after long periods.

The university occupies an isolated position on an eleyated tract,
where presumably it will suffice the wants of the next generations, and
even after the adjacent portions of the city are more closely built up,
it will still occupy a comparatively open position, not in direct contact
with the city’s noise and traffic. It occupies historical ground, as a bat-
tle was fought there in 1776 during the war of the Revolution against
England. In 1812, also, fortifications were erected here during the sec-
ond war with England. After 1825 an insane asylum occupied the site.
In 1892, ata cost of $2,100,000, an area of 163 acres was acquired by the
university on this rocky hill for a new site. The nature of the ground
admitted of making a plateau 750 by 575 feet—that is, somewhat more
than three-fifths of the entire tract—150 feet above the near-by Hud-
son, and 25 feet above the streets; in size about the same as the Dres-
den ‘*‘ Zwinger,” with its surrounding gardens. It 1s, therefore, not so
very large and is smaller than the site of the Natural History Museum,
2 miles away. In 1893 the university purchased at the Chicago
World’s Fair for $3,500 the university plans sent there by the Prussian
educational department, which now hang on the walls of the architec-
tural section of the library; and in 1894 it accepted the building plan

STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 359

worked out by the architects, McKim, Mead & White, for the build-
ings in the Italian Renaissance style. According to this plan 14
separate buildings lie to the right and left of the library in four groups,

persons), the gymnasium, and the power plant for the entire univer-

sity. A handsome model of University Hall is exhibited in the Met-
ropolitan Museum of Art, a mile and a half away. Only the front
part of the hall rests on the plateau itself, the main portion of the
building extending along the back slope of the plateau, which has a
steep descent of 38 feet, so that in the rear the structure rises to an
imposing height of 136 feet, while in front it is 69 feet high. These
lower-lying portions of the site, affording a park-like green with
old trees, are to be inclosed by four dormitories.“ The buildings are
69 feet high, the outer ones having four stories and two basements,
which is made possible by the sloping nature of the ground.

Four of the great outlying buildings for lecture rooms, laboratories,
and collections are completed; also the library and the power plant of
the university hall, and the gymnasium with its baths. The foundation,
stairs, balustrades and the like are of granite; the library is of white
sandstone; everything else is of red-brick construction with sandstone
trimmings. The walks are paved with red brick. The whole makes
an imposing as well as an agreeable impression, gay in summer from
the green color of lofty trees and grass plats. Everything is fireproof;
the framework is of iron; the floors, walls, and roofs are of hollow
brick; the stairs are of stone or of iron and stone. The iron pillars
rest in sheet-iron sockets, which are filled with loose asbestos. The
doors and window frames are of wood; the windows are of plate glass.
Everything is done according to the expressed principle that the best
is not too good and is in the end the cheapest.

The buildings hitherto erected cost $4,250,000;? those yet to be put
up will require $5,500,000. The total cost of the university build-
ings will amount to $15,000,000,° and they will accommodate 6,000
students and 600 teachers. Already the aggregation of buildings—
Columbia University, National Academy of Design, Grant Mausoleum,
St. Luke’s Hospital, and St. John’s Cathedral— splendidly situated on
the high bank of the Hudson in the midst of carefully tended parks, is
regarded as the future ‘‘Acropolis of the New World.”

Columbia is exclusively an endowed university, and although it has
the authorization of the State of New York for its founding, it has
never received a State appropriation. That such a considerable sum
for a university can be raised entirely by private subscription is char-
acteristic of Americans and is an argument for the social justifica-

«See illustrations in Columbia University Quarterly, I, 1899, p. 149. Two five-story
buildings are planned 156 feet in tength, and two 200 feet in length and 40 feet
wide, which will accommodate altogether about 450 students, and wilt cost about
$750,000.

October 3, 1898, reprinted in report of the Commissioner of Education, 1897-98, LI,

tion of their proverbial wealth.“ In America the obligations imposed
by the position of wealth are well discharged. Columbia is governed
privately by self-chosen trustees, and is ugly nominally subject to the
control of the regents of the University of the State of New York in
Albany. It now has an annual income of $400,000 from its endow-
ment of $12,000,000, and tuition fees amounting to $375,000. — Its
current expenses amounted in 1899 to $837,500"; such a deficit of
$62,000 is, however, of no consequence, since persons are always
found who make it good. Nor is a momentary debt of $3,000,000
very oppressive, as it will soon be paid. In 1899 a number of bene-
factors together contributed $75,000 for current expenses alone and
$500,000 for endowment funds, besides a hospital worth over $500,000
with an endowment of $375,000. The current annual expenses of the
University of Berlin amount to $750,000; those of the University of
Leipzig, $625,000, of which $500,000 are appropriated by the Royal
Saxon Government. The city of New York, with its 4,000,000 popu-
lation, has about the same nes ot inhabitants as the econ of

$3,000,000; W. C. de Pauw (1837) and J. B. Colgate (1819), $1,500,000 each; J. N.

$3,750,000 for Vanderbilt University (1872) and Columbia, in New York; J. Rich

(1866); J. C. Green, $1,750,000 for Princeton (1746); Seth Low and J. Loubat,
$1,500,000 and $1,250,000, respectively, for Columbia (this university received in the
last ten years endowments amounting altogether to $7,000,000); E. Cornell, H. W.
Sage, and O. H. Payne, $3,500,000 for Cornell (1865); J. Lick, $750,000 for Berkeley
(1868). Yale, in New Haven (1701), received $5,000,000 from different donors;
Wesleyan University, in Middletown (1831), $2,000,000; Cincinnati (1819), $1,500,000;
Harvard, in Cambridge (1636), receives on an average $1,000,000 to $1,250,000 every
year (last year $1,625,000), etc. G. Peabody gave $6,000,000 for various scientific
institutions; D. B. Fayerweather, $5,250,000. This makes a total of between
$100,000,000 and $125,000,000, and yet is only a fraction of such gifts for universities
and scientific institutions, as may be seen from the list given in the New York
World Almanac, 1900, p. 310. In the year 1899 alone about $75,000,000 were
donated for universities, colleges, schools, and libraries. E. D. Perry (Education
in the United States, edited by N. M. Butler, Albany, 1900, p. 304) says: ‘‘It is
truly encouraging for the future of education in America that so many of her mil-
lionaires are willing to give freely of the fortunes that they have accumulated, and
that those who give the most should set the example of intrusting the application of
the funds to those who best understand the needs to be met.’’ [The above lists
were made up in 1900, but would be considerably enlarged to-day. Mr. Carnegie
alone has given away $100,000,000. ]

These figures are only approximate. I may mention for comparison that the
annual current expenses of Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, amount to
only $200,000.
362 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

Saxony. Leipsic has 3,500 students, Columbia University about 4,000,
of whom, however, only about 2,000 correspond to our students.
These remarks are merely thrown in without any desire to compare
the two universities.

There is an extraordinary difference among American universities.
About twelve or fifteen correspond to our twenty-one German uni-
versities, and even these can not be compared without hesitation,
because they combine with the university to a greater or lesser degree
some of our ‘* gymnasium” classes, and stand, moreover, upon quite
different stages of development. Almost every American university
has a college,” which in its first two or three years corresponds some-
what to our ‘‘obersecunda” and ** prima,” and only in its last years
to the first year of our universities. On leaying college the student,
after passing an examination, receives a degree of bachelor of arts, or
the like, and, if he so chooses, then enters the university proper, which
is organized into faculties (**schools”) as among us. The individual
who leaves college in order to begin his life work possesses, therefore,
a higher education than our young men who leave the gymnasium for
the university. After attending the university for two years the
student obtains the degree of master of arts, or the like, and after one
or more additional years of study, the degree of doctor. The students
at American universities sre accordingly divided into undergraduates
(in the college), graduates or postgraduates (university students in the
more restricted sense), and special students. The latter are either
nongraduates or persons who, after completing their college course,
pursue no regular faculty studies, but immediately apply themselves
to special studies, which lie without the scholastic organization. The
American student is permitted to pursue special studies earlier than
the German student, and the students in general have a relatively free
choice of their lectures, as in the German universities, which is
also already more or less the case toward the close of the collegiate
course.

A person thoroughly acquainted with German and American uni-
versities, Prof. H. Miinsterberg, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, once
declared (Der Western, Chicago, December 3, 1893), with regard to
Harvard, that the examination for the degree of doctor of philosophy
as the last period of the graduate school (that is, the philosophical
faculty) represents a stage of scientific maturity far above the level of
the average German doctor; that the examination for doctor in Har-
vard was more like the German examination, which admits the young
scholar to the office of an academical teacher (‘‘ Privatdocent”), than

« Lately students have been admitted to Columbia without knowledge of the Latin
language, so that there the rudiments are also taught.

STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 363

like the German examination for the degree of doctor.“ This equality
with German universities applies, however, only to a very small pro-
portion of the 150 American scholastic institutions that call them-
selves universities, to say nothing of the 350 colleges.’ Besides
Harvard in Cambridge it may perhaps apply to the following: Chi-
cago, Columbia in New York, Yale in New Haven, Cornell in Ithaca,
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Michigan in Ann Arbor, Wisconsin in
Madison, California in Berkeley, and Stanford in California. Johns
Hopkins in Baltimore has virtually dispensed with a ‘‘ gymnasium ”-like
collegiate preparation, and consequently most nearly resembles a
German university, to imitate whose organization an avowed tendency
exists in many American universities. Princeton, indeed, possesses a
college, but only a philosophical and theological faculty. The twelve
here mentioned (Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Yale, Columbia, Cornell,
Chicago, Stanford, California, Princeton, Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Pennsylvania) have quite recently formed a closer union. Clark Uni-
versity in Worcester comprises a philosophical faculty with 11 teachers
and 34 students (1900), and recognizes the pursuit of science as its first
object, with teaching as somewhat subordinate.“ Thus every one of
the American universities ought to be especially characterized. We
can not in general speak of the universities of the United States as we
do of the German universities. These matters are known to every
educated American, and nothing is more preposterous than to look at
all of these universities of the Union as alike. I must let the matter
rest here with these few general remarks, but refer the reader partic-
ularly to the chapter The American University in the work entitled
Education in the United States, edited by N. M. Butler, Albany,
J. B. Lyons Company (1900), I, pages 249-319.

Columbia University has the following six special faculties to govern
Columbia College:

Juridical faculty, school of law, for common law.¢

Medical faculty, school of medicine.

Philosophical faculty, school of philosophy, for philosophy, philol-
ogy, literature.

“ Quite recently, and after a longer experience in America, Professor Miinsterberg
confirms this statement in the following words: I have no doubt that the doctor
degree in Harvard ranks higher than in any German university. It occupies a
medium place between the German doctor examination and the examination for the
position of academical teacher, in part also corresponds to the German civil-service
examination. (Zukunft, No. 35, 1900, p. 389.) Prof. P. Haupt, of Baltimore, in a
letter addressed to me confirmed this with reference to Johns Hopkins.

> For a better understanding of this subject, Miinsterberg’s remarks in the above-
cited excellent paper, American Universities, in Zukunft, No. 35, 1900, p. 385, may
be consulted.

Political economy faculty, school of political science, for history,
national economy, public law.

Natural science faculty, school of pure science, for mathematics and
natural science.

Technical faculty, school of applied science, for mining and metal-
lurgy, chemistry, engineering, architecture.@

Here, therefore, we have a technical high school combined with the
university. The tendency to spread out in this direction has recently
developed more or less among our German universities. Columbia
College is not strictly separated from Columbia University. Under-
eraduates—that is, students of the college—may take certain courses
of the university.

Two other institutions are closely connected with Columbia, namely,
Barnard College and Teachers’ College.? Both are near by, separated
only by the width of a street, but on their own ground. Barnard
College is intended for women, and corresponds to Columbia College
formen. Teachers’ College is a seminary for male and female teachers
on a university basis. Barnard College was founded and endowed in
1889 by former President Barnard of Columbia. It is an independent
corporation, but the courses of instruction and examination are pre-
scribed by Columbia, and Columbia professors lecture in the institu-
tion besides others appointed by Columbia. Students of Barnard Col-
lege may also attend certain advanced lectures in the university and
take university degrees. Teachers’ College was founded in 1888 and
united with the university in 1898. Certain lectures may also be
attended by Columbia students. These two colleges, therefore, form
part of the university, have the university president as president of
each, but are financially quite independent. Their budgets are not
included in the figures given above.“ Their students, however, are
included in the foregoing estimate. Barnard College has 317 students,
and Teachers’ College 365, besides 750 whose relations to the establish-
ments are not so intimate, while their professors also lecture outside
of the colleges. The university itself had in 1899-1900 2,456 students,
of whom 460 were undergraduates, 1,996 graduate students, and 30
nongraduates, making a grand total of 3,888.

Columbia is less intimately connected with the Union Theological
Seminary on Sixty-ninth street, about 3 miles distant; with the
American Museum of Natural History, where, among others, the
laboratories for anthropology and paleontology are located, with the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, both in Central Park, about 2 miles
distant, and with the New York Botanical Gardens in Bronx Park,
about 5 miles from the university buildings, where also the her-

barium and a portion of the botanical library of the university are
deposited, and where the more advanced botanical laboratory courses
are held. In July and August summer courses of thirty lectures
each on ten topics are delivered in the university. At the instance of
the New York Chamber of Commerce, a commercial high school will
soon be organized. Finally, during the winter, the professors give
free public courses of lectures in the two museums above mentioned
and in Cooper Union, a great free institution for the dissemination of
learning, with 3,500 students and 2,000 daily readers in the library
connected with it. Numerous scientific societies hold sessions now
and then in the rooms of the university, such as the National Academy
of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, with its nine sections, and also the American Astronomical and
Astrophysical Society, the American Chemical Society, the American
Mathematical Society, the American Physical Society, the Geological
Society of America, the American Entomological Society, the Ameri-
can Forestry Association, the American Society for the Promotion of
Engineering Education,“ and others. It is, therefore, a center of
greatly divergent and broad intellectual interests.

At the head of the university is a president, under a board of 22
trustees, who form a self-perpetuating body and appoint the president.
At the same time 5 committees on finance, buildings, promotions,
instruction, and library officiate. The university employs 85 regular
and 14 special professors,’ 240 assistants, etc., and 12 administrative
officers, besides 150 persons under the superintendent of buildings,

«New York itself is the seat of many scientific societies. Only the following need
be named (from Education in the United States, edited by N. M. Butler, Albany,
II, 1900, p. 872): The New York Academy of Sciences, founded in 1817, whose four
sections (astronomy and physics, geology and mineralogy, biology and anthropology,
and psychology and philology) meet monthly. (On the 23d of October, 1899, I
attended an interesting session of the section for anthropology and psychology,
which was held together with the Anthropological Club, with Prof. Franz Boas as
chairman.) The academy also holds general sessions. Every year a reception is
given, with demonstrations of scientific progress. It publishes octavo annals and
quarto memoirs. Its library contains 18,000 works. A scientific alliance includes
the academy and the following local societies: Torrey Botanical Club, New York
Microscopical Society, Linnean Society of New York, New York Mineralogical Club,
American Mathematical Society, New York section of the American Chemical
Society, and the New York Entomological Society. It is the intention to erect a
central building for this scientific alliance. The Preliminary List of American
Learned and Educational Societies, published by the Bureau of Education in 1896,
enumerates 62 scientific societies in New York.

>The position of the ‘‘Privatdocent”’ is not known in Columbia, nor in any
American university. I may mention that the professors of American universities
generally take a year’s leave of absence on half pay every seven years, but may divide
such leave of absence through several years. This may have turned out to be a
necessity, inasmuch as a prolonged journey in Europe is of the greatest importance
to most of them. A similar privilege ought, however, also to be granted to the
European professors.
366 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

among them technologists, since a portion of the new installations
and the greater part of the repairs are made on the premises. The
university, therefore, employs a stafl of over 500 persons, all told.

Each student pays $125 to $200 annually for all instruction. The
university authorities estimate his annual expenses in New York at
between $375 and $825, according to his requirements—#550 for
medium accommodations.“ Eighty-five fellowships and scholarships
are bestowed annually, amounting to almost $60,000, and whoever has
attained the degree of doctor of philosophy in Columbia may continue
his work in the laboratories free of charge. These fellowships and
scholarships vary between $125 and $850, most of them $500, and the
holder of fellowships need pay no college fees. A committee of pro-
fessors aids poor students in order that they may support themselves
while pursuing their studies as private teachers, translators, writers,
evening school instructors, traveling companions, stenographers, type-
_ writers, etc. The student who asks this aid is respected all the more
for it by his colleagues.

The university Sparel publishes a catalogue, which contains 400
to 500 pages of accurate information, a report of the president, of
over 100 pages, catalogues of lectures of each faculty with all possible
special data for the students, comprehensive pamphlets of 100 or more
pages; and also, beginning in 1899, a Quarterly, which treats only of
affairs relating to the university proper. A bulletin appeared from
1890 to 1898. In 1897 a small album of 48 pages was published with
many illustrations and plans, entitled ‘* Columbia University,” which
gives an excellent idea of the whole establishment. Finally, from
1894 to 1900, 16 volumes of a scientific character have appeared in
quarto, octavo, and duodecimo (each volume complete in itself),
together with serial publications of eleven different departments
(contributions, memoirs, or studies), and five periodicals, which are
conducted by members of the faculty.

The power plant.—It was planned to build a power house for heat-
ing, lighting, ventilating, water, electricity, mechanical power, com-
pressed air, etc., directly on the banks of the Hudson River, but a
short distance from the university in a straight line, in order that coal
could be unloaded directly from the vessels into the boiler house.
The pipes and cables were then to have been led up through a tunnel,
but this project was not permitted by the city authorities as the near-
by residents thought themselves damaged by such a plan. In conse-
slang: of thisa handsome boathouse was erected on the eoonae already

“In Hereard fhe expenses are caanatoa at $500 to 5600, in Yale $700, in Philadel-
phia $450. Each student costs the American universities from $125 (at Vassar
College for women) to $400 (Leland Stanford Junior University); in the German
universities the cost averages $175, as estimated from a total expenditure of about
$5,750,000 for 33,500 students,

purchased on the banks of the river, the gift of a patron, and the
engine house was built under the University Hall in a room 165 feet
long, 100 feet wide, and 33 feet high. For this purpose, together
with great tunnels to connect all the buildings, the drains, cellars, coal
bunkers, and ground floors, more than 80,000 square yards of rock had
to be quarried. The machinery is driven by a 4,000 horsepower
engine, that requires 13,000 tons of coal a year, 4,000 of which can be
stored at one time. In order to protect the buildings from the vibra-
tions of the powerful engines, their foundations were all united on a
single wall base separated from the foundations of the buildings; this
had the desired result.

The steam-heating apparatus is installed according to the so-called
direct-indirect system (that is, radiant heat and warmed ventilating
air), and goes through thousands of feet of pipe. The exhaust steam
from the engines suflices for heating the library and the University
Hall. Automatic thermostats regulate the temperature of all the
rooms. The ventilator drives 1,250,000 cubic feet of air a minute
through the building. Nowhere is it renewed less than six times an
hour, in some rooms twelve times. The piping for water, gas, com-
pressed air, vacuum, etc., is unusually extensive, the chemical institute
alone ae over 6,000 discharge pipes and connections. Equally
enormous is the length of wire conduits for light, power, telephone,
electric clocks, signal clocks, watchmen’s time detectors, electric ele-
vators, etc. The cost of the machinery, without counting the prepa-
ration of the foundations, was $200,000, that is, $50 for each horse-
power. The power house itself under the University Hall, including
tunnel and coal bunkers, cost $350,000. The heat, light, and electric
appliances for the buildings still to be erected will cost $550,000,
The whole power system, therefore, will cost about $1,125,000.

The entire power plant was most carefully planned and executed in
the highest style with regard to solidity and neatness. The subter-
ranean rooms are excellently lighted and are models of cleanliness—
the whole a work of art comparable to the power plant of an immense
modern ocean passenger steamer. It should also serve as an object
lesson for the technical department of the university. It is managed
by 18 men, who work in three relays of eight hours each, and receive
$10,000 in wages. The annual expenditure for coal amounts to
$14,000.4 After all the buildings are completed the expenditures for
coal will increase to $27,500 and wages to $15,000.”

The library will some day form the center of the entire university—
an ease lem iden. It is siiuaned at the top of a gently rising ground

would be very appropriate for Dresden.

at the head of broad flights of steps. In Romanesque architecture
according to the French conception, magnificent with its fine pillared
portico and dome rising above the whole, it is worthy of comparison
with the best modern buildings of European capitals. Three stories
surround an imposing central hall, and the whole rests upon a raised
ground floor 200 feet square. The center of the dome is 137 feet
above the surface of the ground.

The library also accommodates those faculties whose equipment
consists only of books and who, as yet, have no building of their own.
Thus, the northern wing belongs almost exclusively to the law faculty.
On the second story is the section of the library belonging to that
faculty; on the third the reading room, with 140 seats; on the fourth
an auditorium for 240 hearers; all three, like the raised ground floor,
containing side rooms for administration, seminars, professors, and
students; constituting, so to speak, a building for the law faculty
within the university library.“ They are, however, already thinking
of erecting a special law building.

The schools of political science and philosophy are in like manner
accommodated in the western and eastern wings; only that here,
instead of the reading room on the third floor, eight seminary rooms
are to be divided into library sections which will serve for the corre-
sponding schools; that is, for philosophy, pedagogies, literature, phi-
lology, political economy, public law, and history. Two such seminary
rooms for Latin and Greek are located on the second floor. This is an
ingenious arrangement, which, so far as I know, has nowhere else been
carried out in this manner. A half story of the entire wing forms a
single room, the inner three-fifths of which are occupied by 26 book-
stacks, for the most part 20 feet long, while the outer two-fifths are
empty. One can therefore look through from one end to the other, a
distance of 110 feet. In the partition planes of the two-sided book-
stacks of 12 by 12 feet run massive sliding doors of oak, reaching to the
ceiling, of such dimensions as are perhaps seldom seen. These, how-
ever, may be easily handled, and by their means the outer open space
may be divided into as many larger or smaller single rooms as may be
desired, up to eight each. Every such room is provided with tables
and chairs, so that one may sit secluded in the library of any par-
ticular branch. This arrangement seems to me as original as it is
practical. The library is not so much a storehouse for books as a
laboratory for study with books. Exactly as much care has been
bestowed upon the reader as upon the books. On the fourth floor of
each of these two wings there are four auditoriums, each accommo-
dating 35 to 58 persons, as well as administrative and other side
rooms. In the south wing, moreover, there are two auditoriums,

the last year amounted to more than 25,000, A special donation of
$15,000 was received for the purchase of books. It is estimated that
the annual ave ‘age increase will reach 18,000. The bookstacks are
distributed in three stories, two stacks always standing one upon
another; that is, arranged in each story independently of the others.

With the exception of the round wooden stacks in the rotunda and the ~

old wooden ones in the basement they are of lacquered iron of dark
green color, with similar movable veneered shelves (4-7) that may
be easily adjusted, so perfectly finished that their surface feels like
velvet. Iam not acquainted with such excellent work of this kind in
Europe.

The repositories have an intermediate space of 24 feet only, but may
be brightly lighted by electricity. They were put up in the begin-
ning without any intention of utilizing the daylight. On the ground
floor there are special fireproof vaults for rare books, a provision
which is lacking in most European libraries. In the central rotunda,

the galleries of which are supported by 16 costly green granite pillars
29 feet high, with gilded Ionic capitals, there are 153 seats. In its
entire design and in its artistic ornaments, although the decoration is
not yet entirely finished, the rotunda constitutes a great attraction.
The reference library comprises 10,000 volumes. The newly-acquired

«The library is arranged and catalogued according to the Dewey system, com-
pleted by Cutter (Dewey was director of the library until 1888). Milkau ( Central-
kataloge, 1898, p. 20) writes, after Billings, that the Dewey system is now being replaced
at the Columbia University library by another. This, however, is not the case. I was
told that they were satisfied with the system and that they could get along very well
with it.

prepared, is accessible to everybody. The reading room is open on
week days (with only four exceptions during the year) from 8.30
o’clock in the morning till 11 o’clock at night; during the summer
holidays (July to September) till 10 o’clock. The library is enviably
easy of access. Up to a late hour in the evening everyone has
unlimited freedom of reference in all rooms open to the public.

The order cards are forwarded by pneumatic tubes, the books
return on small lifts driven by compressed air. In the evening the
lofty reading room, in addition to the direct electric lighting, suffi-
cient in itself, is brightened up by a so-called ** moon,” that is, a great
globe suspended in the middle, on which electric light is thrown from
the eight corners of the upper galleries and reflected from it. Beside
the central hall is located a special library with its own reading
room—the architectural library with 16,000 volumes. The valuable
folios are kept in a horizontal position in separate iron repositories on
copper rollers, and are thus very easily handled without injury to the
binding. This arrangement is as perfect and as artistic as that of
the above-mentioned bookstacks. I may note also among the special
sections, a Goethe library of 1,200 volumes and a Kant library of 600
volumes.

The books are consulted chiefly by professors and students, who are
permitted to take them away. Last year more than 77,000 volumes
were thus taken out by about 3,900 persons. No record is kept of the
attendance within the library, but all the seats in the reading rooms
are usually occupied. Outsiders may consult books only in the library
itself. Nine librarians and 22 assistants and cataloguers attend to the
needs of the library, together with 29 copyists and messengers.
Altogether 67 persons are employed, including 33 women.

The building itself is of fireproof construction throughout, but has
wooden furniture (except most of the bookstacks) and wooden doors
and window frames. The floors are stone, covered partly with par-
quetry and corticine, a very elastic kind of linoleum.

A wonderful spirit of care and order is everywhere apparent.
Even in the anterooms the same elegant solidity prevails as in the
sumptuous main rooms. Very few institutions of the kind could be
compared with this one.

The cost of the library amounted to $1,250,000, $600,000 of which
were for the interior furnishings. It was opened in 1897.

I must refrain from describing in detail the four following build-
ings with their institutes already completed, and must limit myself to
short accounts:

1. The building for natural history and psychology (Schermerhorn
Hall) is 215 feet long and 85 feet wide. The two basement floors, the
first story, and half of the second story are devoted to mineralogy and
geology; the other half of the second story to psychology, with labora-

tories after the Wundt pa‘tern. Psychology is diligently fostered in
the universities of the United States even more than in Germany, and
Columbia University ranks among the first in this respect. Quite
recently J. D. Rockefeller gave $100,000 primarily for the better
endowment of this chair. ‘The third story contains seven other rooms
for psychology, the remainder for botany. The fourth flour is devoted
to zoology. Each of these sections has its museum for instruction, its
reference library, its laboratories and lecture rooms (the large one for
250 persons), and the necessary anterooms. This was not carried out
according to a fixed plan, but no pains have been spared to adapt every
detail to its special objects and to work each out as completely as pos-

sible. Toward this object advantage has been taken of the experience
not only of America but also of Europe. The Prussian university
plans at the Chicago World’s Fair, the purchase of which was men-
tioned on a previous page, were of special value in this connection.
The buildings, which are situated entirely on the plateau, have four
stories above the ground floor; those erected on its edge have six on
the outer side. The entire furnishings, including the cases containing
the collections, the doors, and the window frames, are of wood; in
other respects the construction 1s quite fireproof. The floors of the
corridors, the laboratories, and the stairs are partly of marble, partly
of other stones, marble mosaic, or asphalt; the floors of the lecture
rooms, offices, etc., are of fireproof material, with parquetry of pine
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. She

or oak. In the reading and college rooms the parquetry is covered
with corticine.

The above remarks apply also to the following three buildings:

2. The building for physics, sestnononly; mechanics, English, and
rhetoric (Fayerweather Hall) is 155 feet long and 60 feet wide. On
the two basement floors, and on the first and second stories, physics
is taught, the large lecture room having a capacity for 152; on the third
floor is the section for English language and rhetoric with a lecture
room for 140 students, and four rooms for 60 each, and the fourth is
devoted to astronomy and mechanics, with one lecture room for 100,
and three for 50 each.

3. The building for chemistry and architecture (Havemeyer Hall) is
215 feet long and 85 feet wide. On the two basement floors, metallurgy
is taught; on the first to the third stories, chemistry (the lecture room
for 325); on the fourth, architecture, with a large drawing room for
about 150 students and a library, museum, lecture rooms, and special
study rooms.

4. The technical building (engineering building) is 155 feet long and
60 feet wide, with museums, laboratories, workshops, lecture rooms,
the largest for 146, drawing room, etc. The fourth story is almost
entirely occupied by a large room for drawing, containing 78 tables.
The workshops in the neighboring Teachers’ College are also utilized
by the students of the mechanical section.

These buildings cost between $300,000 and $600,000 each, altogether
about $1,750,000. Three of them be ar the names of their founders.
Kight similar ones are still to be erected; among them, one each for
the law faculty, for philosophy and pedagogies, for history and polit-
ical economy, and for philology. There will also be a college building,
costing $312,500. Between these structures, to the east and west of the
library, a chapel will be built, for which quite recently an anonymous
patron donated $100,000, and a student’s clubhouse, which is already
in course of construction.“ Two older buildings, West Hall and Col-
lege Hall, erected in 1878 and 1882, formerly used for different uni-
versity and college purposes, than at present, will be torn down as
soon as they can be replaced by buildings provided for in the plan.
It would, therefore, not be worth while to describe them more minutely.

Finally, the gymnasium under University Hall is especially worth
seeing, on account of its fitness and elegance. It has, perhaps, hardly
an equal of its kind. Manly sport plays a still greater part in America
than in England. The main room, which occupies two-thirds of the
building in the rear, is of apse form and measures 35 feet in height,
168 feet in leneth, and 134 feet in width, with an area of 16,000 square
feet, where athletic, gymnastic, and pisthenic exercises may be con-

ducted. An elliptical running track, constructed with extraordinary
care, and which also extends through the front third of the building,
is 11 feet broad and 555 feet long.“ Its ends are slanting with the
outer edge 28 inches higher than the inner edge. In a mezzanine
story are located rooms for fencing, boxing, and hand ball. There
are 32 shower baths with marble walls, as well as 1,600 iron lockers.
Half of the room under the gymnasium is occupied by a swimming
tank in apse form, 100 feet long, 50 feet broad, and 4 to 10 feet
deep, with a capacity for nearly 260,000 gallons. The water is
constantly renewed, twice filtered, heated to 68° F., and then cooled.
Kiectric currents radiate through it from the edge beneath the surface.
Around the tank are placed four large dressing and rubbing rooms,
42 private dressing rooms of thick opaque glass, and 20 plunge baths,
shower baths, and tub baths. In spite of its location below ground
everything is brilliantly illuminated by light shafts from large win-
dows. Each student pays $7 a year for exercises, baths, and a
locker. On entering, he is subjected to a rigid physical examination,
receives advice and instructions according to the state of his health,
and is afterwards directed in his exercises. The gymnasium is open
from 10 a.m. to 7p. m. One or more men in authority are always
present. Instruction is given very systematically, and it is compul-
sory for the younger students, in order that everyone may have an
opportunity to learn the elements of self-preservation and defense.
With this object in view, chiefly boxing, fencing, wrestling, and
swimming are practiced. To go further here into the details of the
varefully considered methods of exercising would carry me too far.
The gymnasium cost about $500,000.

Upon the lower stories described, an additional story is now being
built, which is to contain eating rooms, club rooms, and administrative
rooms, as well as a hall, capable of accommodating 1,500 persons, for
the religious and social life of the students.’

Unquestionably Columbia University has a great future before it.
It will pursue its victorious career in the foremost ranks of the cham-
pions for the dissemination of culture and the advancement of science,
and it will the better perform its task if it keeps at its head men of
lofty intellectual qualities, of eminent talent for organization, and of
far-reaching personal influence. The presidents of the leading univer-
sities of the United States hold a prominent place in the public life of
the great country; everybody knows them as everybody knows the
ruling statesmen and politicians, and they are respectfully heard on
questions affecting the public weal. Thus President Low, of Colum-
bia, represented the Government at The Hague Peace Congress of
1899. The presidents exert a much greater influence over everything

concerning the university” than the changing rector of the German
universities who is subordinate to a government department, and their
power of initiative is quite different. That republican Americans
love monarchical powers is shown by their railroad kings, their direc-
tors of great rings and trusts, and also by the authority of their
Presidents, despotic for the time being. Seth Low,’ doctor of laws,
was mayor of Brooklyn and an authority on the subject of municipal
administration. In 1889 he was placed at the head of Columbia, and
since then a new epoch has been inaugurated in the development of
this university.° He has-not only placed his vast energy and his far-
reaching influence at. the service of the university, but he also sets an
example by his self-sacrificing devotion. He erected the wonderful
library of the university, that ornament and model of its kind, by a
personal expenditure of $1,250,000, and he ranks in other respects
among the most active patrons of the great institution upon which he
has left the impress of his mind.@

THE PREDOMINANT INFLUENCE OF THE GERMAN OVER THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES.

Upon the predominating influence of the German universities over
the American, and in consequence over the whole intellectual life
of the Union, all voices appear to be unanimous. ‘Thus, among
others, David Starr Jordan, president of Leland Stanford Junior

aThe difficulties of these positions are excellently described in an anonymous
article in the Atlantic Monthly ( April, 1900, pp. 483-493), on The Perplexities of a
College President.

bMr. Low retired in 1901 when he was elected mayor of the city of New York.
Columbia then had 385 teachers, 4,500 students, 9 faculties, a library of 311,000 vol-
umes, and its property amounted to $18,000,000, of which Mr. Low had given
$1,500,000—1903.

¢The author of an article ‘‘What is a University?’’ in the Spectator, London, Feb-
ruary 12, 1898, p. 230, says, among other things: ‘‘Columbia is one of the best
appointed institutions of learning in the world.’’ A Riedler (‘‘Amerikanische tech-
nische Lehranstalten,’? Verhandlungen zur Beforderung des Gewerbefleisses, 1893, p.
422) expressed the opinion seven years ago that Columbia would probably become the
foremost institution of learning in the United States. Columbia University and
Teachers College were each awarded a gold medal at the Paris Exposition of the year
1900, the former for photographs, publications, and psychology, the latter as a
higher normal school.

d1t might interest German readers to know that Columbia University in 1889
bestowed the degree of doctor of laws upon Carl Schurz. The promoter said, among
other things, on that occasion: ‘‘We must congratulate ourselves that in honoring
him, we help to strengthen the bond which unites Germany and America; that we,
in honoring him, also honor the great land which is his parent country and the
original home of all those in whose veins flows English blood.”’

At the same time a Carl Schurz donation to the amount of $20,000 was given to the
university by his friends on condition that the interest on one-half the amount
should be applied to establishing a fellowship in German and the other half be
devoted to purchases for the Germanic section of the library. A knowledge of Ger-
man is now one of the requirements for admission to Columbia University, and in
most of the universities the degree of doctor is bestowed only upon the candidate
who is able to read printed German fluently and to translate it into English at sight.
376 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

University of California, in an article on *‘The urgent Need of a
National University in Washington,” “ observes:

The great revival of learning in the United States, which has shown itself in the
growth of universities, in the rise of the spirit of investigation, and in the realization
of the value of truth, can be traced in a large degree to Germanic influences. These
influences have not come to us through German immigration, or through the pres-
ence of German scholars among us, but through the experience of American scholars
in Germany. If it be true, as Mr. James Bryce says [American Commonwealth, II,
1889, p. 694, 3 ed.], that ‘‘of all institutions in America,’’ the universities, ‘‘ have
the best promise for the future;’? we have Germany to thank for this. It is, how-
ever, no abstract Germany that we may thank, but a concrete fact. It is the existence
in Germany of universities, strong, effective, and free.

Even English voices lay stress upon this fact. Thus, in an article
in the Spectator of February 12, 1898, on ‘* What is a University?”
in which, in consideration of the establishment of a university in Lon-
don, five types of modern universities are characterized, the French,
German, English, Scotch, and American (p. 231), it says concerning
the American types:

We come now to the American universities, by which we mean the greater insti-
tutions of culture, not the hundreds of petty colleges to be found in all parts of
America. Some of these, in our judgment, come nearer to the ideal of a true uni-
versity than any of the other types. Beginning on the old English collegiate system,
they have broadened out into vast and splendidly endowed institutions of universal
learning, have assimilated some German features, and have combined successfully
college routine and discipline with mature and advanced work. Harvard and
Princeton were orignally English colleges; now, without entirely abandoning the
college system, they are great semi-German seats of learning. Johns Hopkins at
Baltimore is purely of the German type with no residence, and only a few plain
lecture rooms, library, and museums. Columbia, originally an old English college,
is now perhaps the first university in America, magnificently endowed, with stately
buildings, and with a school of political and legal science second only to that of
Paris. * * * The quadrangles and lawns of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton almost
recall Oxford and Cambridge; their lecture rooms, laboratories, and postgraduate
studies hint of Germany, where nearly all American teachers of the present genera-
tion have been educated.

I myself received the impression that the majority of the professors
of the universities which I visited in New York, Chicago, Philadel-
phia, Boston, and Cambridge, with whom I became acquainted- -and
there were not a few of them—had studied in Germany or had at least
spent some time there, of course excepting the few Germans who
filled positions in the universities named.

When, in January of this year, the faculty and students of the Uni-
versity of Chicago gave a formal reception in Chicago to the German
ambassador, the professor of political economy, Mr. Laughlin, deliv-
ered the address of welcome, from which I take the following sen-
tences (Illinois Staats-Zevtung, January 25, 1900, p. 5):

There is no American university which is not imbued with the fire of German
intellectual activity. We have attended in crowds the lecture halls of the universi-

« Forum, January, 1897, p. 600.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 377

ties and lighted the lamp of our knowledge at their altars. The Americans have
found the love of truth, the sacred yearning after knowledge and poetry in Heidel-
berg, Gottingen, Tiibingen, etc. When we look down upon the red roofs and towers
of Gottingen, as upon the red marvel-flower of wisdom as it lies there surrounded
by a garland of lindens standing on the old walls, we find there not only the student
quarters of Bismarck but also the places where Bancroft and Longfellow intrenched
themselves behind their books. To be sure the German universities have not served
as models for our own, but we have adapted the spirit of their knowledge to our cir-
cumstances. * * * Our debt to German science is great; we can not repay it.

I heard these very words, that the debt of gratitude could never be
repaid to Germany, from the mouth of one of the professors of the
Technical High School in Boston, when, upon my thanking him for
the very obliging reception which I had met with, he refused to accept
my thanks.

(In the library of Edison’s private laboratory at Orange, near New
York, | found, as artistic ornaments, the bust of Alexander von Hum-
boldt and the portraits of Bunsen, Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, Kopp, Liebig,
and Magnus, but of no other scientists. When I told Edison how
pleased I was to see that he surrounded himself with the portraits of
German scientists, he told me of his friendship with Helmholtz and
Siemens, and mentioned that he had that very morning to consult a
treatise by Wohler.)

The present ambassador of the United States to the German Empire,
A. D. White, at a banquet given in July of this year to the American
Mechanical and Civil Engineering Association in Berlin, expressed
himself in the following terms: He looked back with great satisfaction
to the time, thirty years before, when he had studied the conditions of
the high schools and the technical schools in Berlin, he had been able,
on his return to America, to point to these institutions as worthy of
imitation. As a consequence Cornell University, of which, for a
quarter of a century, he was the first president, and other special and
technical schools were founded. Many of his countrymen had received
in Germany the impulse and the knowledge for the establishment of
institutions of learning in their own land. He had returned to Amer-
ica with love and reverence for his teachers. He, with many of his
countrymen, regarded Germany as his second fatherland.

L. Triang said, in a lecture on ‘‘Germany in the American univer-
sities,” recently delivered before the German Society of Columbia
University (Zectgeist, March 5, 1900):

The student who, after completion of the studies usual in his country, wishes to
perfect himself in his profession and carry on special studies, almost invariably goes
to Germany, where a great proportion of the entire body of American teachers have
received their final education and imbibed the German spirit of learning and the
German scientific faithfulness.

Prof. Harry Thurston Peck, of Columbia University, and, as editor of the Book-
man, one of our most prominent critics [I quote from an article by M. Groszmann
in The Open Court (Chicago), October, 1899, p. 620], showed in a recent article that
the old traditions of American education have been wiped out by German influence;
378 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

that a vivid interest in German pedagogy is asserting itself more and more, and that
German language and literature are crowding out other foreign influences. He went
so far as to say, ‘‘German influence has already altered the racial character of our
people.”’

In Volume II of the report of the Commissioner of Education for
the year 1897-98 (Washington, 1899), in the chapter entitled Foreign-
ers in Universities of Europe,” page 1702, and in other places of this
great work, may be found the following statements: American students
preferably attend Jena, Leipzig, Heidelberg, and Berlin, owing to the
courses at these universities. In 1895, 3,362 foreigners were matricu-
lated at German universities, of whom 514 were Americans, but it is
estimated that at least an equal number studied by attending lectures,
so that altogether an annual quota of over 1,000 Americans may be
estimated. At the same time only 108 Americans were matriculated
in Austrian institutions and 65 in Swiss institutions. In 1895 Berlin
had 159 Americans out of 4,018 students, Leipzig 53 out of 2,798,
Gottingen 30 out of 878; Paris, on the other hand, had only 32 out
of 10,915.”

James Bryce (American Commonwealth, 3d ed., II, 1899, p. 682)
says, giving reasons therefore, that ‘‘extremely few” of the American
students go to Oxford or Cambridge in England. With reference to
France, it is stated in an article by F. C. Newcombe, ‘‘ Opportunities
for biological study in Paris and the requirements for the new doc-
torate,” in Sczence (May 11, 1900, p. 740):

Why do these men in American universities advise their students to go to Ger-
many? Why are the scientific libraries in this country so much better stocked with
German literature than with French 4iterature? I can not help feeling, though I
have no statistics, that on the whole Germany has, within the past forty years, pro-
duced more scientific men and more scientific literature than has France. It is doubt-
less true that we neglect unduly French scientific literature in this country, but it
is probably also true that to-day, as forty years ago, we justly look to Germany as
the seat of the leading spirits in the progress of biological science.

EK. D. Perry, professor of Greek in Columbia University, says:?

‘It is the glory of Germany that she has seen more clearly than
other nations how true it is that the highest scientific training is none
too good for her public servants.” Compare his very plain statement
concerning the influence of the German university on the develop-
ment of American universities, pages 288 and 289. Although S.
Sherwood (University of the State of New York, Regents’ Bulletin
No. 11, Albany, 1893, p. 269) ascribes to the ‘** revolutionary France ”
the greater influence in shaping the character of the entire modern
system of education of Europe and America, nevertheless he freely
admits that the German systems are now ‘‘ models for the world.”

In a very interesting manner H. A. Hinsdale, professor of peda-

“The bad influence of Paris on the students has been described in Nation, p. 149

gogics in the University of Michigan, also describes this same influ-
ence in the chapter Notes on the History of foreign Influence upon
Education in the United States of the above-cited education report
(I, p. 603-629). Among other things he there gives a list of the
Americans who studied in Gottingen from 1789 to 1851, in Halle from
1826 to 1849, in Berlin from 1825 to 1850, and in Leipsic from 1827
to 1840. Supplementary to this, Professor Perry, who has already
been quoted, remarks” that after 1848 a noticeable number of Ameri-
cans, including many of the most eminent scholars the country has
produced, obtained degrees in Germany, and that after 1870, hundreds
visited Germany annually, which, together with the opening of the
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in January, 1876, on an avow-
edly German plan, gave a mighty impulse.

In the same periodical (p. 6) H. A. Todd, professor of romantic phi-
lology in Columbia University, states that prior to the last twenty years
American students abroad attended almost exclusively German univer-
sities. To-day, therefore, the American universities are manned pre-
eminently by professors who have been in close contact with the leading
minds of Germany. Although it is now customary to advise American
students to study for a year in Germany, Professor Todd can, ** with
prophetic eye, foresee the time when it will become of interest to an
increasing number of European students to seek part of their training
in the United States.” I think time will show that he is right. That
so large a percentage of the active professors of the American univer-
sities have studied in Germany may perhaps be in part explained by
the fact that the men who sought to complete their education in
Europe were a very select intellectual band. Only the best fitted and
the most ambitious young scientists felt the desire to extend their
circle of vision. Their knowledge and their views were essentially
widened in Europe, and thus they returned predestined to fill positions
as teachers.

Prof. H. Miinsterberg, of Harvard, has recently expressed the opin-
ion’ that, although the spirit of American universities has for the past
fifty years been determined by men who have studied in Germany and
brought home with them enthusiasm for German science, these rela-
tions are now changing. The number of students, he says, who after
a couple of years of study return from Germany deeply disappointed,
is increasing Ina striking manner, and everywhere the advice is heard
to finish one’s ordinary studies in America and to seek further inspi-
ration in Germany only after having obtained a degree. Such a change
would show that the former conditions of dependence no longer exist
to their former extent, and that the time when Professor Todd’s
prophecy will come true is already approaching. .

time the advantage of an elegant
exterior. Especially perfect is
the varnish, which is obtained by
triple burning. By its use the
iron becomes as if enameled. It

bronze, brass, marble, painting,

There are several larger firms
of the same sort in the United

Baltimore, parts of an order for $60,000. The iron book stacks of
this firm pleased me particularly on account of their simplicity, as

in metal from a building to a box.” It is the more surprising that the
American museums have as yet no iron, but only wooden cases and
desks for their collections,“ whereas the former are already used to
some extent in Europe. There can be no doubt that the Americans,
when once they shall have decided on iron furniture for museums, will
be in a position to construct it in a much more perfect manner than
we have as yet succeeded in doing in Europe, since their experiences

It is difficult to induce the firms mentioned to execute small orders
for Europe. I have so far only succeeded in obtaining for the Dresden
Museum from Snead & Co. a free standing iron book stack, and from
the Art Metal Company an iron card catalogue case with twelve
drawers.

GLASS CASES.

At the establishment of F. Pollard (33-37 Bethune street, New York
City; also Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburg, Pennsylvania) I saw glass
cases and glass desks without framework except on the back, and of
excellent workmanship. My attention was first attracted to very large
show windows of this kind whose plate glass panes were not fastened
in iron or wooden frames, but were held by metal screws which
pressed the edges of the glass together, with only a thin layer of cloth

between to make them fit tightly. These cases are, so far as I am
aware, as yet nowhere used in museums. They now serve only for
show cases in business houses, but are excellently adapted for public
collections on account of their elegance and absence of framework on
the show sides. Cases completely proof against dust, which have not
as yet been manufactured, could easily be attained. They are opened
and closed at the back by means of glass doors in wooden or white
metal frames; socle or base of marble or of any other material. I
give a figure of a case of the kind which, with lower socle, could be
used as a desk top, and which may be had up to five meters in length.
I obtained a sample of such a case of smaller size for the Dresden
Museum. At the Industrial Exposition in Philadelphia I saw similar
very elegant glass cases manufactured by the firm of F. X. Ganter,
Leadenhall and Stockholm streets, Baltimore, with branch houses in
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, These cases were
made tight by means of silk bands. The business is now turned into
a joint stock company, the Crystal Show Case and Mirror Company,
which is to go over ‘‘the whole earth.”

FIREPROOF BUILDINGS.

In New York very many fireproof and burglar-proof buildings may
be found. I inspected among others the magnificent building erected
by Gibson in 1896 for the New York Clearing House Association
(Cedar street), whose balances amount annually to $35,000,000,000 ¢
and where millions in gold are constantly stored. Every sitte is done
here to guard against robbery, fire, and insurrection. The different
rooms are separated: from one another by grates and doors; the iron
cases for valuables are so constructed that they may be instantly closed
by a grasp of the hand; the cash vaults may be submerged, and the
whole may be turned into a kind of fortress with cannon and muskets.
Electric bells to summon aid from without are to be found every-
where. The vaults could be reached by dynamite only in case one
were willing to bury himself under the ruins, since undermining: it
from without is practically impossible on account of the deep founda-
tion. Elsewhere iron armor plates have been employed as a protection
against cannon balls. It does not appear from without that the
clearing house is so formidably protected. Such contrivances would,
indeed, not be applicable to museums, but some of them might be
introduced to protect certain objects of value or sections of the
museums.”

‘I take at random among others, as an object well worthi seeing, the
recently completed fireproof building of the University Club (Fifth
avenue and Fifty-fourth street), five stories in front and eight stories
in the rear, constructed by McKim, Mead & White. It is.a Floren-
tine cues ees 125 feet in hehe ornamented among other
things with the arms of eighteen American universities in stone.
The club has 3,000 members, all of whom must possess a learned
degree in order to be admitted, and contains a library of 20,000 vol-
umes. <A bigher standard of solidity, fitness, and carefully planned,
practical utilization and distribution of space, with taste and elegance
in execution, could scarcely be imagined. The flat roof, which affords
a fine view, serves in summer evenings as a pleasant resort. In the
cellar there is a gymnasium. All mechanical contrivances are of a
high degree of perfection, embodying all possible modern inventions,
and many of them would be applicable to buildings for collections.
The whole is a model and unique structure of its kind and compar-
able only to a prince’s palace. The cost of the ground, building, and

furnishings amounted to over $2,125,000.

«The average daily balances in 1901 were $254,193,638; on May 10, $598,537,409,
The average daily balance in gold and bank notes was $11,600,784.

?In the basement of the Swiss Landes Museum at Ziirich there is a fireproof and
burglar-proof room, lighted only by electricity and handsomely installed, for all the
precious things of the collection and where they are exhibited to the public in iron

desks.
NAT MUS 1903——25
386 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

With regard to the fireproofing the following may be specially
noted: The outer walls are of brick and granite; all the inner parti-
tions of hollow terra-cotta blocks. The ceilings are supported by
wrought-iron columns, which are covered over with hollow terra-cotta
blocks. The joists are of steel, and the dome ceiling is constructed in
even arches of hollow terra-cotta blocks. The space between these
blocks and the joists is filled with concrete. In this concrete are placed
the beams, to which the flooring is nailed. This and similar ceiling
construction is indeed known and used among us, but is not in such
general use as in America.

For protection against fire, two 4-inch pipes run from the roof to the
cellar, where they are connected with a steam pump, and continue out
to the street, so that the hose belonging to the city fire department
may be attached to them. In each story there is a branch pipe with
hose coupling, hose, and mouthpiece. The hose is wound around a
wheel. The roof is flat and completely covered with glazed bricks.

In the roofing of fireproof buildings special attention should be paid
to protection against flying Sadie, which may extend much farther
than is enema supposed. Some years ago a fire broke out in a pri-
vate residence on Fifth avenue between Sixty-seventh and Sixty-

Fic. 27.—Ceiling and floor construction.

eighth streets, opposite Central Park, in the best part of the city, by
which thirteen persons lost their lives. The sparks flew over two cross
streets and ignited the roof of another private residence, resulting in
the loss of two additional lives, and yet the houses in this locality all
look like solid stone structures. The distance was from 600 to 650 feet.
This shows the danger of leaving buildings containing collections in
the middle of the city, as some of them are located in Dresden, without
very carefully planned protection against fire, especially in the upper
portions. Fire has often been known to cross a street more than 65
feet wide.

In describing the institutions of Chicago I shall return to the sub-
ject of fireproof buildings and questions connected with them.

The heating and ventilating apparatus in the model building of the
University Club may also be described somewhat more in detail:

The exhaust steam of the electric light and power plant suffices for
heating the entire building with low-pressure steam. Every radiator
has its own supply pipes and return pipes, and the main return pipes run
into the cellar below the water level of the boiler, in order to afford
lord

safer and noiseless circulation. The condensed steam is forced back
to the boilers by self-regulating steam pumps.

The temperature in the main rooms is automatically regulated by
Johnson thermostats. This apparatus was invented by Professor
Johnson, of Milwaukee, and perfected to its present successful applica-
tion. The Johnson Temperature Regulating Company, Fourth avenue,
New York, has already set up such apparatus in hundreds of buildings.
The most essential portions of the apparatus consist of diaphragms and
cut-off valves to control the source of heat, moved by compressed air,
and thermostats, which regulate the flow of compressed air to the
valves by the movement of a compound band. This band is to be
adjusted so that the desired range in the temperature may thereby be
attained. The ventilating system is independent of the heating, so
that it may be set in motion according to the need of the different
times of day. The fresh air is warmed a little so that it does not dis-
turb the equilibrium of temperature in the rooms. This warming
is also regulated by thermostats. The system of ventilation insures a
thorough circulation, but at the same time prevents a draft. All the
main rooms are sufficiently provided with fresh air, which is changed
on an average six times an hour. The exhaust air is drawn off accord-
ing to the need. The cloak rooms, toilet rooms, ete., the kitchen,
which is fitted up in a specially ingenious manner, and the laundry
have exhausters only. The air is here renewed from ten to fifteen
times an hour.

The fans which supply the air are centrifugal blowers, which are
driven by direct-acting, high-pressure engines. These fans, the
engines, and the heaters occupy a special room in the cellar. The
exhausters on the roof are discoidal ventilators, which are driven by
direct-acting electromotors.

LIGHTING OF INTERIORS.

I saw for the first time in the Boston Art Museum a lighting of
rooms by windows with prismatically-ribbed panes, which made it
possible to illuminate otherwise somewhat dark wall surfaces in such
a manner by daylight that they were thereby adapted to the hanging
of pictures. When once my attention was attracted to this matter I
found such prismatic panes in use in many other places. I hunted up
the business office of the American Luxfer Prism Company, 160 Fifth
avenue, New York, a company which originally had its headquarters
in Chicago, but which now has its central office in London under the
name General Luxfer Prism Company, with branches in Chicago,
Toronto, London, Paris, and Berlin. In the United States the Ameri-
can Luxfer Prism Company has its offices in seventeen other cities
an extensive industry whose products are widely distributed.

It is the more astonishing that museums have not yet directed their
attention to this matter, for nowhere did I find this glass in use except

388 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

in the Boston museum mentioned, unless it escaped my notice, while
scarcely a building for collections exists which is not capable of
improvement in this respect. The company makes 60 different kinds
of prismatic panes and single prisms, the latter for skylights, which in
the United States are used very much in rooms under the pavements
of the streets, since these rooms belong to the cellars of the adjacent
houses. The ribbed panes, of the uniform size of 10 square centi-
meters, are electrolytically glazed between flat copper bands,“ and are
then fireproof, which offers another great advantage and permits their
employment as window shutters, doors, etc., for closing entire stories,
and the like.

A similar company is the Mississippi Glass Company, with agencies
in Boston (Boston Plate and Window Glass Company). Prof. C. H.
Norton, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made a report
on this subject in 1898, based upon experiments (The Diffusion of

important for lighting and such a security against fire.“ I give a

¢ Dr. B. Wandolleck, assistant in the Dresden Zoological Museum, was kind enough
to prepare the following statement concerning luxfer prisms and electro-glass, based
on the two papers cited in the text as well as on his own studies. I insert it here

figure of a prismatic ribbed glass plate and a single prism. The latter
may be had up to a considerable size. The flat form (multi-prism
plate) costs $30 to $40 a square yard; and the ribbed glass plates in
their copper frames, $20 a square yard. I have made a trial of a
window with about 5 square yards of plate glass in the ethnographic
department of the Dresden Museum.

because I consider the subject important for museums so long as they have not
learned to build them with all rooms equally well lighted:

Everybody has perhaps noticed that rooms on the ground floor, under most cir-
cumstances poorly lighted, in winter, when the window panes are thickly covered
with frost, have an agreeable, uniform light. They have perhaps also noticed that
at other times, when the panes are clear and dry, only asmall space near the window
is really well lighted and the other parts of the room remain more or less in shadow.
In the case of the frost a peculiar diffusion of the light is noticeable, the sharp con-
trast between the part near the window and the inner part has disappeared, and
only very gradually does the intensity of the light diminish toward the back part of
the room.

For lighting a room by daylight by means of its windows, the bit of open sky
which looks in through the windows is more important than anything else. The

FIG. 30. Fig. 3.

amount of light derived by reflection from other objects is, on the other hand, very
small. The nearer opposite buildings are to the windows of a room or the higher
those buildings are, the smaller will be the bit of sky which can look into the room
and light it up. Why, then, under the same conditions of light, does such a room
appear brighter—that is, more uniformly lighted—when the windows are frosty than
when they are clear?

The window is struck by a bunch of rays which goes through the plane parallel
glass without changing their direction (fig. 30), and the more obliquely they fall
the smaller will be the surface of floor which they strike and illuminate. The iight
which illuminates the rest of the room is derived by reflection from this small spot.

The particles of frost on the windows consist of crystallized water, of an immense
number of small hexagonal prisms. Every ray of light which strikes one of these
small prisms is refracted and takes another direction. Since the numberless prisms
lie in every conceivable direction on the surface of the glass, the rays of light strik-
ing them are also turned in every possible direction. They will not fall parallel on
the floor as before, but shoot into the room in every direction. The room is no
longer filled with the scanty reflected light which comes from the lighted spot on the
floor, but with light direct from the sky (fig. 31).

This observation has led to a discovery which is of the greatest importance in
lighting dark rooms by daylight. The problem to solve was merely to replace the
390 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.
DISTANT HEATING.

The distances which in Dresden are taken into consideration in the
establishment of the distant-heating plant for the museums, ete., hold
a middle place between American district-heating systems and distant-
heating establishments, but incline more toward the former.

The New York Steam’ Company has established a great district
steam heating system with several boiler houses in the lower part of
the city almost from the Battery to the other side of the city hall,
1,500 yards up Broadway, extending about half that distance east and
west in the side streets; altogether about 8 miles of pipe. Among
other great buildings ‘ele alt in this system are the post-office, Mills
Building with ten stories, and Manhattan Life Building with its 350-
foot tower. The amount of steam furnished (including power) is said
to be satisfactory, but the returns are not considerable. Such district
heating establishments are to be found in Lockport, Detroit, Phila-
delphia, Washington, Hartford, etc., but all except one are out of
use, as they did not prove a success. On the other hand, district
heating systems have lately been combined with electric plants by
utilizing the exhaust steam, as in Springfield, Illinois, and in other
cities. For the financial success close proximity of the heated district

ice prisms of the frozen windows by giass prisms and to give the glass prisms a regular
arrangement in place of the irregularity of the ice crystals. Another part of the
problem to solve was to reguiate the direction of the rays falling in at random.
Everything was already fully accomplished by the Fresnel lenses in the light-houses.
It was therefore only necessary to remodel this costly contrivance so as to adapt it to
other uses and to cheapen it enough to bring it within reach of the general public.
This the Luxfer Prism Company succeeded in doing. It manufactures out of plain,
colorless, hard-glass mold small, strong window panes, with one surface plain, but the
other fluted with deep semi all grooves. By means of these furrows they obtain
strong strips of glass, to which are given the form of distinct-angled, three-sided
prisms. The prisms have a common basal surface, parallel to the plane surface of
the plane, and their corresponding surfaces are likewise parallel. (See fig. 28.)

If rays of light fall upon the plane, they are not conveyed on in the same direc-
tion, as in the case of ordinary window glass, but are refracted to an angle bearing a
definite relation to the angle of the prisms. (Fig. 31.)

If we take a window consisting of nothing but prism panes, all of whose prisms
lie parallel, all rays of light will strike into the room in a parallel direction. It is
easy to understand that by a different arrangement of the prism panes or certain
portions of them, rays can be conducted into any desired parts of the room.

But all poorly lighted rooms do not have such spacious windows as supposed in
the above description. A very targe number of rooms lie below the level of the
street. Their small windows and the poor light of the generally large rooms limit
their use to a great extent. These windows, which are placed in a narrow shaft and
often scarcely rise above the level of the street, excludes the use of those prism panes
because the amount of light coming in from the sky is entirely too narrow. This
difficulty has been obviated by the construction of a particular kind of prism.

The mass of light would become greater if the light shaft could be made larger,
but traflic on the street forbids that.

It therefore became necessary to find some contrivance which eaid make it
possible to enlarge the light shaft without interfering with the street traffic. The
light shaft is covered by a plate consisting of prisms. This plate is composed of very
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 391

to the power station and also a certain size of the district is requisite.
In St. Joseph, Missouri, a block of business houses, with a room space
of over 300,000 cubic yards, is heated by the exhaust steam from the
electric station situated a mile away.

On the other hand, it has been discovered that the special heating
apparatus is more advantageous for very large buildings and single
eroups of buildings, although the expenditure of coal is not thereby
diminished. Of such, there are very many in America. Most large
buildings have their own power plants for electric lighting, electric
and hydraulic power for elevators, ventilators, etc., and for the manu-
facture of ice and the like, in which the working engines afford steam
for heating almost without cost. Chimneys project but little above
the roofs and never give forth such smoke as among us, especially as
in Dresden. In America better coal is burned. Relatively few high
chimneys are seen in the cities and they do not attract so much atten-
tion on account of the height of the buildings. I have already men-
tioned the distance-heating of Columbia University. The Grand
Hotel on Broadway possesses a plant for electric lighting for four
blocks of houses,“ and the exhaust steam from the engines suffices to

large single prisms (see fig. 29, p. 388), which receive light direct from the sky on
their entire basal surface. They then throw this maximum mass at a fixed angle
against the perpendicular or oblique, stationary or movable windows of the room,
whence prism panes, instead of the usual window glass, distribute the rays.

In order that the ideas which we have just traced, and which rest upon physical
principles, might be put into practice with a result approaching as near as possible
to the theory, one more invention was requisite, namely, that of galvanic glazing.

Whereas formerly, and still almost universally, the panes are fastened to the
framework of windows by means of putty or strips of lead, galvanic glazing employs
electrolytically precipitated, and therefore to a certain extent plastic, copper as a
cement. The single panes, with a framework of thin copper strips, are tied to plates
of fixed size, and thus placed in the copper bath. In about thirty hours electrolytic
copper is precipitated upon the copper strips and this binds the panes to their
frames firmly and immovably, making them absolutely air proof.

The advantage of this electrolytic glazing is great. In the first place, the strips
separating the panes can be made considerably narrower, which is equivalent to a
smaller loss of light; and then such windows are more elastic and much more capa-
ble of resistance than puttied windows, and show themselves to be fireproof to an
eminent degree.

While windows glazed in the usual manner immediately burst and fall out on
being heated, these windows have shown their absolute stability during very many
trials. If, while heated, they are struck by a stream of water from the hose, they
burst, to be sure, but never fall out. Electro-glazing is therefore to be used especially
in elevator and light shafts, since the latter, with their glazing so little capable of
resistance, are not only incapable of opposing the devouring element in the different
stories, but generally open the way to it.

«In New York among most of the straight long and cross streets a block east of
Fifth avenue is in general from 400 to 420 feet long and 200 feet wide, the long
streets from 75 to 140 feet wide, and the cross streets 60 feet wide; west of Fifth
avenue a block is generally 800 feet long and 200 to 204 feet wide, the long streets
being 100 feet wide and the cross streets 60 or 100 feet wide. If you ask the distance
of anyone on the street he will usually reply that it is so many blocks.
392 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

heat the hotel. Most of the great hotels in the United States have
their own power plants.

In installing the plant it is of the greatest importance to protect the
hot pipes from the outside water. This may be accomplished by
proper drainage.

It is also important, by the insertion of expansive joints of special
construction and fixed in a particular way at proper distances, to com-
pensate for the expansion of the pipes and to keep them in position.
In this case it is always advantageous to place the boilers deeper than
the building to be heated. Finally, the pipes should be isolated. This
is best accomplished by laying them in cemented conduits easily
inspected, and by wrapping them in asbestos paper, hair felt, and
linen, to prevent loss of heat so far as possible. The pipes then
remain serviceable from five to fifteen years, according to the temper-
ature to which they are subjected; furthermore, those protected by a
covering of incombustible mineral wool last still longer. This ques-
tion has been made the subject of an extended series of experiments.
Hot water has the worst effect on iron, whereas steam is harmless.“

What I have said is certainly far from exhausting the subject of
what New York has to show with reference to buildings for collections
and technical scientific contrivances, in their bearing upon museum
interests. Lack of time, however, has compelled me to limit my
observations, nor can I in making my report discuss everything that

I have seen.

perhaps, most resembles the ‘‘ Université de France,” founded by
Napoleon in 1808. It is trying to solve the universal problem of
extending culture, and has supervision in the State of New York over
34 universities and academic high schools (colleges of liberal arts), 76
professional technical schools, 139 academies, and 559 high schools
(that is, secondary schools) with 101,630 scholars, over 183 libraries,
museums, and the like, as well as over 523 organizations which are
affiliated with it—that is, over 1,514 in all. ‘* Its activity embraces not
only the tield of work of academies, colleges, universities, professional
and technical schools, but also that of libraries, museums, courses of
lectures, and the like.” It is governed by nineteen unpaid regents
(who are elected in the same manner as Senators of the United States,
and who are the only life-tenure officers in the State of New York),
together with the governor, the lieutenant-governor, the secretary of
State, and the superintendent of public instruction, with a chancellor
and vice chancellor at the head, who are likewise elected and serve
without pay.

The university confers degrees after examinations, as well as
licenses to practice medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine in the
State of New York. It annually aids the institutions named to the
extent of $250,000, provided each of these institutions raises a similar
sum for the same purpose, and it aids public libraries to the extent
of $50,000, on the same condition. Its annual budget amounts to
$500,000 (1899). Like other States of the Union, the State of New
York has a department of public instruction which directs the
elementary schools (free common schools), and nine-tenths of all the
children attend these schools; but no other State of the Union has a
department which attends solely to the interests of higher instruction.
As such this department exercises jurisdiction over the institutions
which are placed under its control. It holds annualiy a congress for
higher instruction, which is attended by delegates from other States
and universities, and whose proceedings are published.“ It was lately
proposed to establish in the State of New York a department of
education, which was to embrace the university and the department
of public instruction, with the chancellor of the university as respon-
sible, executive, and administrative head, but the project has so far
not been carried out.

The university is organized into six departments: Administration,
colleges, high school, home education, library, and museum. It has
its offices in the capitol. The administrative department includes the
executive, the general supervision, the finances, and the duty of
making reports.” The college department conducts the examinations

and confers degrees. There are 68 different examinations and 120
branches. ‘They are held in the above-mentioned 760 institutions of
learning themselves, as well as at different central localities, where ten
or more candidates appear.“ The high school department organizes
instruction and lectures in wider circles.’ The home education
department has six subdivisions: Extension teaching,” study clubs,”
exchanges, traveling libraries, public libraries,’ and library school.
The State library department manages the library; the State museum,
the museums.

In the following pages I shall confine myself to the last two institu-
tions, and shall, moreover, consider only the traveling libraries, the
exchange system, and the library school, since these are connected with
the library.’ All three belong to the Home Education Department.

up local libraries and advancing their interests in every manner. It does this by
counsel, by making up lists of the best books with remarks, by cash appropriations
up to $200 a year each, the latter not only to public, but also to all other free libra-
ries, as well as to any 25 taxpayers who ask for it together in places where no
libraries exist. An equal amount must be raised by the institutions or persons con-

York was established. This survey at that time embraced entomology
and botany within its scope. In 1857, jointly with the New York
State Agricultural Society, a building was erected for the grow-
ing collections and called the Geological and Agricultural Hall. In
1870 it received the name State Museum of Natural History. It is
now called the New York State Museum. In the course of years the
space became inadequate, so that a portion of the great paleontological
collection had to be placed in the old State House, the entomological,
botanical, and ethnological collection in the capitol; but a great new
building is planned for the State library, which will also accommodate
the museum collections until a special building shall become necessary
for them also. There is a prospect that the plan will soon be carried
out, since present conditions are untenable.

The annual budget amounts to $40,000. The director is State geol-
ogist. There is also a State paleontologist, a State entomologist, and
a State botanist. Each of these has one assistant, and there are also
six other employees. In summer, however, a large number of per-
sons, mostly young scientists, are appointed in the geological survey.
The collections are open daily except Sunday from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m.

The State museum and the geological and natural history survey
have published since 1842: Natural History of New York, 30 quarto
volumes on zoology, botany, mineralogy, geology, agriculture, pale-
ontology (mainly), with many plates and maps; annual museum reports
since 1889; geologist’s annual reports since 1881; botanist’s anunal
reports since 1869; entomologist’s annual reports since 1882; seven
volumes of museum bulletins, in 34 numbers, since 1887; three vol-
umes of museum memoirs since 1889; an economical and geological
map of the State in two editions, and some handbooks, such as: 5, New
York State Museum (28 pages); 13, Paleontology (8 pages); 15, Guide
to Excursions (120 pages); 16, Entomology (12 pages); 17, Geology.
All these valuable publications relate only to things found in the State
of New York, and are to-day even more zealously continued. Since
1836 more than $1,500,000 has been expended on the geological survey.

The museum is a provincial museum in the best sense of the word,
which in its way reminds one of the Stuttgart Provincial Museum.
Its most renowned constituent pact is the great geological and paleon-
tological collection of James Hall, for many years State geologist, who
had already in the eighties sold a portion of his private possessions,
the collection of type specimens, to the American Museum of Natural
History in New York for the sum of $68,725, and whose property left
at his death, especially rich in fossil invertebrates, will perhaps be
purchased for the State museum for $60,000. Since the exhibition
will not be maintained much longer in the overcrowded main museum
and in the other buildings mentioned, I call particular attention only
to the excellent order prevailing throughout, and mention as especially
belonging to the provincial collection the great transparent erindings
396 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

of stones; minerals and fossils; the fossil invertebrates; the collection
of general mineralogy and lithologic geology; the selected specimens
of mammals and birds (also the other animals of the State); an excel-
lent assortment of domestic fowls, with their eggs shown alongside;
the Gould collection of shells; and, finally, the relief maps of the State
(1 mile to the inch).

The furniture for many years has been of wood.

As a special feature 1 may mention that schools in the State of
New York may borrow for a short time small collections for purposes
of instruction.@

The New York State Museum, established in a spacious up-to-date
building, will certainly in the future assume a commanding’ place
among the museums of the country. }

NEW YORK STATE LIBRARY,

The New York State Library is located in the third, fourth, and
fifth stories of the west wing of the capitol, and ought to afford space
for 3,000,000 of books. The space has, however, from time to time
been otherwise occupied, so that now 150,000 volumes have to be
stored in boxes. The library consists of 300,000 volumes, 125,000
bound duplicates (over 200,000 unbound), 250,000 manuscripts,’ and
150,000 pamphlets—a total of over 1,000,000. As already remarked,
plans have been drawn for a great new building for the library and
museum combined. The university, together with the library and the
other collections, now occupies about one-third of the great capitol
building, which I must first mention for it holds a place among the
most remarkable buildings of the United States.

K. A. Freeman, of Oxford, writes:

But on the whole the American city which struck me most was Albany. Rising
grandly as it does on both sides of the noble Hudson, it suggested some of the ancient
cities on the Loire. It has the advantage, rather rare in American cities but shared
with Albany by the Federal capital, of having one dominant building. The general
look of the city carried me so completely into another part of the world that, if any
one had come up and told me in French, old or new, that the new capitol was “‘le
chateau de Monseigneur le due a’ Albanie,’”’ I could almost have believedhim. * * *
The building has a most successful contour; in its details it is a strange mixture of
styles, not so much confounded as used side by side. This is accounted for by the
history of the building, and by the employment of more than one architect. * * *
There are parts which I can not at all admire; but there are other parts, those in
which the column and round arch are employed, which certainly pleased me as
much as any modern building that I have seen fora long time. When I say that
the arches of the senate chamber seemed to me, as far as their general conception
goes, worthy to stand at Ragusa, some will understand that I can say no more.

Albany is a hilly city. The hill on which the capitol is situated
rises 150 feet above the Hudson, 51 feet above the level of the wide
main street, which runs up from the river. The building is 300 feet
long, 400 feet wide, and 108 feet high, and will have a tower 300
feet high. (The Reichstag building in Berlin is 395 feet long, 254 feet
wide, and 81 feet high.) The inner court is 92 feet long and 137 feet
wide. »A straight staircase, with four landings and seventy-seven
steps, the lower sixteen 100 feet wide, extends outward 166 feet from
the building. The whole occupies 3 acres. It is built of white granite
in the: free renaissance style with wonderful stone masonry. The
three staircases are of reddish sandstone, the western being particu-
larly effective. Eleven elevators render access easy from one part of
the building to another. The basement contains 144 rooms for heat-
ing, lighting, ventilating, storage, etc. The administrative rooms and
the governors magnificent state hall are on the first and second floors.
These two floors combined include over 120 rooms. On the third
floor are the magnificent halls of the two houses, the court of appeals,
the historical collection, the library, together with over 50 rooms.
The fourth story contains over 40 rooms, among them the offices of
the university, the entomological, botanical, and ethnological collection
of the State museum (the latter with rich archeological finds from the
State of New York and its vicinity). There are also on the fourth
and fifth floors additional library rooms. The building was begun in
L867, occupied in 1879, and finished all to the central tower in 1898.
Its cost was originally estimated at $4,000,000, but over $25,000,000
have already been spent upon it. The architects were Fuller, Laver,
Kidlitz, Richardson, and Perry.

The library, with its appliances planned and executed in the most
minute detail, some of them in beautiful and artistic style, is particu-
larly worth seeing. It is open daily, except Sunday, from 8 in the
morning until 10 in the evening; lighted in the evening by electricity.
On Saturdays, holidays, and from July to September, it closes at 6 p.m.
It is accessible only from the third story. Until recently the director
was also secretary of the university. He has under him 81 librarians,
archivists, assistant librarians, assistants, etc.;51 employees in all, and
among them 37 women. The annual budget amounts to $75,000. The
west wing of the capitol may be said to form on the third story a
single room 290 feet long, 40 to 60 feet wide, the middle of which is
occupied by the great reading room, 53 feet high, 67 feet long, 40 feet
wide, which is connected with five additional reading rooms on the
right and five on the left, all occupied with bookstacks, altogether
with more than 300 seats. There are, moreover, two administrative
rooms. The reading rooms are in part adorned with palms and other
living plants. On the window side one may glance along the entire
suite of nine rooms, 290 feet long, which, together with the fine view
of the country and the distant mountains which may be enjoyed from
398 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

the windows, makes a very pleasing impression. On the fourth and
fifth floors the same amount of space is at the disposal of the library,
making in the two stories combined forty-one additional rooms, for
the library school, the section of public libraries, the duplicate section,
the library museum, the bindery, the children’s reading room, ete.
The library school has a lecture room in the seventh story of a corner
pavilion. The museum contains a collection relating to library build-
ines and library administration of several thousand books, pamphlets,
samples, formularies, models, etc., which are very exactly classified
and catalogued. The collection is unique of its kind and extremely
instructive. @

In the New York State Library particular attention is paid to law
(60,000 volumes, principally American codes),? medicine (25,000 vol-
umes),° sociology (86,000 volumes), instruction (16,000 volumes), his-
tory and kindred subjects (40,000 volumes), genealogy, bibliography,
and Americana, as well as everything relating to the State of New York.
It contains also a special collection of female authors and of books for
the blind (of whom there are 5,000 in the State of New York) and for
children, as well as for the State officials residing in Albany. About
2,200 periodicals are received by subscription or donation.

bIn the excellent annual report of the director for 1898 it is stated on p. 28 that
the time is near at hand when every prominent lawyer of the State of New York
will be connected with the library by telephone.

¢The report of the director for 1898, p. 35, expresses the opinion that the time
is at hand whén most of the physicians, also, of the State of New York will be con-
nected by telephone with the library. In both cases a fee of 25 cents per half hour
is to be paid when more than half an hour is required to give the information called
for. The medical library is also used in the State of New York asa circulating library
in the same sense as the organization of the traveling libraries described on a following

page. ‘

of hose, and alarm indicators. Only a part of the floors are covered
with linoleum. They are mostly of parquetry or brick, with strips
of carpet. Some of the book rooms proper have iron grates. The
bookstatks and bookshelves are mostly of iron, the other furniture
of wood, both strikingly elegant. There have recently been intro-
duced sheet-iron waste-paper baskets with covers, because one of the
ordinary waste-paper baskets was once set on fire. The folio volumes
lie in their stacks on rollers, like those mentioned in connection with
Columbia University. The cases for maps and photographs are con-
structed in a very practical manner. The separate drawers drop when
drawn out to an angle of 75 degrees, so that the sheets may not only
be conveniently examined as if on a slanting desk, but may also be
placed for closer inspection on a lattice which covers the drawer.
The books are bound in twelve colors, corresponding to the principal
languages of the globe; for example, black represents German. This
applies to all books which are bound for the library or in the library
itself, and makes it easier to find them quickly. Current periodicals
are kept in pasteboard boxes. Movable stacks for transporting books
are constructed in a very practical manner.

For the library proper two extra elevators are in use. They are
installed in a very ingenious manner, provided with electric bells and
telephone. There are also staircases, partly of iron, partly of wood.

The arrangements for the care and use of the books show the great-
est skill and attention to every detail.

The arrangement of the entire library is strictly according to the
system devised by Melvil Dewey, who has been director since 1888.
According to his ingenious decimal system, the figure signs contain
the title of the book in a nutshell, and the books are arranged strictly
according to the figure series. Each book has, therefore, its definite
place and its prescribed sign. The system, which is followed else-
where only in Columbia University and in smaller libraries, has here
completely demonstrated its value. The card catalogues are made
very accurate. They have in America extremely practical arrange-
ments for such card catalogues. Even the price of the book is given
on the later printed catalogue cards, which are furnished by the
Library Bureau in Boston. Up to the present time there are over
300,000 cards in use, the greater portion arranged according to authors.
Author and subject cards are kept separate, but in cases standing
side by side; the author catalogue is in 140 drawers, each containing
1,200 cards; the subject catalogue is in 112 drawers. They are both
made in duplicate. There is also an alphabetical list of all the authors
represented in the library. In the accession catalogues one may find
all possible data relating to any book.

The library publishes the following: Annual reports since 1819 (the
eighty-first, of 1898, has 105 pages and is illustrated); bulletins with
reports since 1891; additions to the bulletins since 1890, 4 nunibers;
400 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

legislation bulletins since 1890, 10 numbers; history bulletins since
1898, 3 numbers; library school bulletins since 1891, 3 numbers;
public libraries bulletins since 1893, 6 numbers; bibliography bul-
letins since 1895, 18 numbers; library catalogues since 1856, 9
volumes; indexes of university publications since 1897; syllabuses
which contain bibliographies; a traveling library; finding lists, a
mountain-side library, young people’s libraries, a library for the blind,
ete.. in 56 and more numbers; annual lists of Hest books since 1895,
and others; also many historical publications. In 1898, all told,
365,000 copies of such publications appeared.

This is further distinguished from many other libraries by the divi-
sions for traveling libraries, exchange of duplicates, and the library
school.

Traveling libraries division.—Vhe special traveling libraries division,
which has existed since 1892, contains about 45,000 volumes. Lots of
25, 50, 75, or 100 of the best books are lent for six months to publie
libraries, to any twenty-five taxpayers who meet in one place, to
schools, associations for instruction (extension centers), study clubs,
reading circles, as well as to any other organizations which are regis-
tered as such at the university and need books, for which security is
to be given, and from 50 cents to $4 each is paid for transportation
expenses, One hundred volumes are, for example, divided into fiction
(22 per cent), history (18 per cent), biology (13 per cent), travels (11
per cent), science and useful arts (9 per cent), sociology (5 per cent),
religion and ethics (4 per cent), fine arts (8 per cent), other literature
(15 per cent). There are forty-one such miscellaneous sets, several
of which have been duplicated ten times. ‘The percentage of each sub-
ject represented is, of course, not always the same in the different sets.
There are, moreover, seventeen collections of 25 or 50 volumes each on
special subjects, such as political economy, finance, agriculture, French
history, history of the United States, literature, etc. For these sets
the best books in the English language are sélected. There are also
collected and lent out small libraries which relate not only to a spe-
cial subject, but which also include what is more remotely connected
with this subject and which therefore encourage the student to con-
sider and study any particular question from every point of view.
Such assortments of books are called environment libraries. Teachers,
study clubs, and reading circles may themselves select books from
the lists to a total value of $100 (combined libraries) and take them
on the same conditions. For purposes of instruction teachers may
also get as many copies of one and the same book as they may need
for their pupils. The average price of each book may be placed at
about $1. The books are sent out in handsome locked oak cases,
which cost about $14 for every hundred volumes. Exact statistics
regarding their use are returned to the library, which incloses in each
book a card for this purpose. In 1899, 557 series were sent to 420

places. In 1898, 540 series were sent to 396 places, comprising 18,951
books, which passed through the hands of a large number of readers.
In spite of their being instructive I can not here go into details with
statistics on this subject.“ A writer on this peculiar and, so far as I
know, unique arrangement says: ?

The State of New York can well afford this offer of books to her citizens. The
plan is at once generous and, in the highest sense, profitable, and is confidently
commended to the consideration of other States.

In a like manner the State library lends from its great collection
for purposes of instruction, photographs of paintings, portraits, build-
ings, and the like, including glass and frames, when desired. It also
sends out wall pictures with magic lanterns.“ A small fee is charged
to cover the expense of shippage. Plate 12 represents a room of the
library where such pictures are hung.

The division of exchanges, a peculiar establishment, is also connected
with the library. There are 350,000 duplicates. Every library of the
State of New York, every school, every lecture circle, every study club,
every reading society, which is registered as such at the university
and is organized according to the prescribed rules (we saw above that
there are now in that State 1,511 such centers, large and small), may
deliver to the university books for which they have no further use.
In return for these they receive others of equal value, according to
the-choice of the recipient. About 20,000 volumes and pamphlets are
now annually exchanged in this manner. This may, therefore, be
regarded as an exchange book trade, which conducts its business with-
out expense to the persons interested, who do not even have to bear
the expense of transportation. All the surplus copies of the govern-
ment publications of the State of New York are also placed in this
duplicate collection, as well as the surplus stock of the works, books,
pamphlets, handbooks, bulletins, reports, etc., printed by the univer-

a@See, among others, Extension Bulletin No. 27, 1899, pp. 28-46.

interesting details. See, also, the small handbooks of the New York State Library:
Traveling Libraries, 12 pages (1898), and Loans to Academies, 4 pages (1898), as

Library school.—It is now almost a rule in the United States that
everyone who seeks employment in a library shall have attended one
of the seven library schools which are located in Albany (New York
State Library), Brooklyn (Pratt Institute), Philadelphia (Drexel Insti-
tute), Champaign (Illinois State Library School, University of Illi-
nois), Washington (Columbian University), Madison (University of
Wisconsin), Los Angeles, California, Amherst, Massachusetts, and
Cleveland, Ohio. The four latter are only summer schools. Regular
lectures on bibliography and library science are also delivered in a
number of universities and colleges (Bowdoin, California, Colorado,
Cornell, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Wellesley).

The first school of the kind to which all others are more or less
indebted for their existence was founded in 1887 at Columbia Uni-
versity, New York, by Melvil Dewey, who was at that time director
of the university library, and removed to Albany in 1889. It includes
a faculty of ten instructors, each of whom represents and teaches par-
ticular branches of library science. Six of the instructors are women,
an example of the great attraction this branch has for women in
America. The special branches are: Library economy, cataloguing,
lending system, reading, bibliography, classification, history of libra-
ries, advanced cataloguing, reference work, binding, library printing
and editing, dictionary cataloguing, library building, indexing. The
number of pupils is limited to 50. For admission an examination or
the possession of a certain college degree is required. Pupils under
20 years of age are not received. The course is for two years, and
lasts for thirty-eight consecutive weeks in the year. The weeks con-
sist of five working days of eight hours each. Every pupil receives a
table with all library appurtenances, at which he may work from 8
o’clock in the morning until 10 in the evening. ‘The tuition fee for
two years amounts to from $80 to $100. The expense of one year’s
attendance at the library school in Albany, including tuition fee, room,
board, books, official study, travels, etc., amounts to from $325 to $625.

Instruction consists of the following: (1) Lectures by prominent
librarians, publishers, booksellers, printers, bookbinders, and the like,
and by the instructors of the school. (2) Reading and reports from
books belonging to the special library school on the subjects of study.
(3) Solving of difficult problems relating to cataloguing, bibliography,
aids to readers, and the like, with debates. (4) Seminary exercises.
(5) Practical training in the State library itself, as well as in the small
libraries of the city. (6) Visits for the purpose of study to the libra-
ries of New York, Boston, ete., to the great publishers, printing offices,
bookbinderies, art institutes, bookstores, book auctions, secondhand

«See Handbook No. 1, Outline, pp. 36 and 37, and No. 10; Study Clubs, p. 18.

bookstores, ete. (7) Object lessons: Everything referred to in the
lectures is, when possible, exhibited in the original or in models, plans,
or drawings. Thus, for example, one may see ten different kinds of
American and European library book stacks in practical use beside one
another, and by actual trial become acquainted with the best. Differ-
ent portions of the library are fitted up according to different models,
in order that the students may learn by comparison. (8) Finally, the
pupils are made acquainted with the above-described educational
methods of the New York State University, as they are in many respects
related to library interests.

In the first year the following subjects are treated: Exercises in cata-
loguing for beginners, elementary bibliography, accession department
work, dictionary cataloguing for beginners, classifying for beginners,
shelf work or disposition of books, systems of lending, and of book-
binding. For students of the first and second years together, course
of reading, scope and founding of libraries, government and service,
regulations for readers, library buildings, reading, literary methods
and book making, library bookkeeping, library museum, personal col-
lections. In the second year, are taught bibliography for advanced
students, reference work, exercises in cataloguing for advanced stu-
dents, dictionary cataloguing for advanced students, classifying for
advanced students, history of libraries, and original bibliography.
Finally, a dissertation is required, and then, after an examination
has been passed, a degree is conferred (bachelor, master, or doctor of
library science). ‘The best scholars receive scholarships and fellow-
ships, up to $500, and may look forward to an early appointment in
Albany. Up to October, 1898, the library school had filled 642 posi-
tions with its pupils. Summer courses are also held during the holidays;
and private instruction and instruction by means of correspondence
are also given.“

The existence of such schools explains the advanced condition of
library science in America.’

It is recognized ‘*that the influences of the New York State Library
are as yet the strongest that exist to raise the standard of librarian-

>In Germany a chair for library science (‘‘ Buch-und Schriftwesen’’) exists only
in Gottingen and Leipsic. (In Leipsic, however, the professor does not lecture. )
Other lectures on library science in German universities are sparing and more of the
archeologic-historical kind. In Prussia, after a voluntary service of two years ina
library, an examination must be passed before appointment, but not in Saxony and
Bavaria. The German library employees are, however, mostly scientists. ~ In Amer-
ica there are but few in this particular branch, while among us there is rather a lack
of specially educated minor employees. I think that more attention should be paid
to library science in the German universities than is now the case. If libraries are
intellectual eating houses, care should be taken that the dishes are well served.

ship and to advance the best educational work now carried on by the
modern library.” “ The New York State Library aims at the greatest
conceivable utilization of all of its literary treasures. Its object is to
send every book where it will do the most good. I left this institu-
tion carrying with me the highest respect for its director’s talent for
organization.

The University of the State of New York contributes an astonishing
amount to the universal distribution of knowledge in a manner quite
peculiar to itself. J am convinced that a great future lies before it.
Its work, however, has already received the greatest recognition, as
shown by the circumstance that at the Paris Exposition of this year
(1900) it received the remarkable number of three first prizes (‘* grand
prix”), one to the State Museum specially for its paleontological pub-
lications, a second to the library specially for the establishment of
traveling libraries and the home-education department, and a third to
the college department for technical education.

In the year 1836 the Young Men’s Association of the City of Buffalo
was founded as a municipal library. In 1885 a house of its own was
erected, the Buffalo Library, which, in 1897, was reorganized as
the Buffalo Public Library. The building, also called Library and
Art Building, is massive and fireproof, in the Romanesque style
of architecture, with triangular ground plan, about 300 by 250 by 175
feet in size, and cost nearly $375,000—about the same amount as the
site. Situated on Lafayette place in the midst of the business houses
of a great industrial city, the exterior is already badly discolored by
smoke. It is now occupied by the following:

In the basement, the museum of the Buffalo Society of Natural
Sciences; on the raised ground floor and the second story, the public
library; also on the second floor, the collections of the Buffalo Fine
Arts Academy and the Buffalo Society of Artists; on the third floor,
the collections of the Buffalo Historical Society. Within a short time,
however, the entire building will be given up to the library. The
Natural History Museum will secure a homeof its own from a bequest
of about $250,000. The Art Academy, which was founded in 1862,
will, together with the Society of Artists, with whieh the Art Students’
League is also connected, move into the Albright Art Gallery, now in
course of construction,’ for which $500,000 are to be expended by
private individuals. Finally, the collections of the Historical Society,
which was also founded in 1862, were to be exhibited in connection with

the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901.7 As all this would
make a radical change in the museums mentioned, I limit myself to a
few words concerning the Natural History Museum, and speak of the
library in a somewhat more detailed manner.’

MUSEUM OF THE BUFFALO SOCIETY OF NATURAL SCIENCES.

The Natural History Society of Buffalo was founded in 1861. It is
under the formal control of the University of the State of New York,
in Albany, and its object is the advancement and the study of the
natural sciences. Lately it has devoted itself particularly to making
collections of the local fauna and flora, and for this purpose is divided
into fourteen sections. There is a president at the head of the institu-
tion. In 1898 it had at its disposal an income of $3,500, of which $625
were derived from membership fees, $250 appropriated by the city,
$1,250 interest money, etc.

The present director of the museum is a woman (conchologist).
The different sections are presided over by professional scientists or
amateurs, who serve without pay. The best parts of the collection
are the minerals, the fossils, the shells, and the herbarium. A larger
series of deformed mound skulls should be noted. The museum con-
tains, all told, about 60,000 natural history specimens; the library,
4,300 books. It is open daily from 9 to 5, Sundays from 2 to 5;
admission free. The number of visitors last year was 105,000. The
society has 250 members, who pay $2 or $5, and 160 corresponding
members. The publications are as follows: Annual reports (the one
of 1898, with 18 pages; the earlier reports were longer, but none
appeared in 1899), bulletins with illustrations (6 volumes); see also
*‘charter and by-laws * * * together with the will of Dr. George
EK. Hayes * * * 1890.” Regular lectures are delivered and meet-
ings of the society are held in one of the larger rooms. The Buffalo
Field Naturalists’ Club of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences,
founded in 1880, is affiliated with it. There is also a Buffalo Micro-
scopical Club, founded in 1876, which publishes Transactions.

While the unfavorable exhibition space in the basement, which is
only 14 feet high, and the limited means at the disposal of the society
have hitherto prevented it from displaying its already considerable
collection to the best advantage, it can hardly be doubted that the
Natural History Museum of Buffalo will, in its new location, receive

stands also in the Delaware Park—1903.

an impetus corresponding to the importance of this populous and wide-
awake city of the future, to its handsome and favorable geographical
position, and to the patriotism of its intelligent inhabitants, who will
not remain behind other cities of the Union.

LIBRARY.

The main library is arranged on iron bookstacks with wooden
shelves in a hall 164 by 47 feet and 21 feet high. This hall is located
on the raised ground floor, which contains several handsome, spacious,
well-lighted reading rooms, as does also the second story. The
library is excellently fitted up, though not with the elegance of the
Columbia University library in New York or the State library in
Albany. Under municipal control, as well as under the supervision of
the University of the State of New York, in Albany, it is governed by
a board of directors, consisting of 10 members, with a president and
a superintendent, who is the actual director. It derives its principal
income from the city, amounting to four-fifths of four one-hundredths
of 1 per cent of the whole taxable property of the city of Buffalo.
That amounted to $8,250 in 1899.¢ Its total income is $90,750. Of
this sum, $40,500 were needed for the salaries of 79 employees. Sixty-
seven are employed in the library itself, 12 in the building, including
45 women. One of the higher female employees receives $900
a year.

There are 150,000 volumes in the library, together with 10,000 pieces
of music, ete. There are subscribed to, or received as donations, 285
periodicals and 73 newspapers. The increase for 1899 amounted to
21,000 volumes, which cost $21,725, and 1,500 donations. Nearly
seven thousand dollars was needed for binding. The books are cata-
logued and arranged according to the Dewey system, which works
excellently. There are three special catalogues in use: (1) The dic-
tionary catalogue for the public, which includes the author, title, and
subject cards in one alphabetical series; (2) an author and title card
catalogue for the employees; and (3) a shelf list. The number of
cards of these three catalogues are for each book about four, two, one,
respectively; therefore for each book about seven. The dictionary
catalogue is well advanced, and replaces a subject catalogue, which is
still in use, and which is a shelf list with many references.

The entire force of employees follow with the greatest zeal the one
aim to make the library as useful as possible for popular instruction,

@ Boston, with 550,000 inhabitants, in 1897, in a similar manner, gave for like pur-
poses, $275,000; Chicago, with 1,700,000 inhabitants, $250,000; Philadelphia, with
1,200,000 inhabitants, $125,000; Cleveland, with 385,000, $75,000; St. Louis, with
650,000, $75,000; Pittsburg, with 290,000, $67,500; Indianapolis, with 185,000, $42,000,
ete. In nearly every Massachusetts town the dog tax is devoted to the support of
the public library. ‘‘The more bark, the more book’’ (American Review of Reviews,
September, 1899, p. 528).
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 407

consequently the greatest imaginable liberality prevails, together with
exemplary and yainciaeate order. Any resident of Buffalo may bor-
row any book for fourteen days free. A neglect to follow any of the
rules is punished by fines, which in 1899 reached a total of $2,750.4
The library is open daily from 8.30 or 9 a. m. to 9 p. m. (with electric
lighting); also on Saturdays and holidays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m
but on these days books are not loaned out. The children’s depart-
ment is open on school days from 2.30 p. m. until 6 or 7 p. m., and
on Saturdays and holidays, that is to say, days on which the schools
are closed, from 9 a. m. until 6 or 7 p. m.; Sunday from 2 p. m. until
6 p.m.

Kach room has direct telephone communication with every other
room. The building being fireproof, it is thought sufficient to depend
upon vigilance er anit any other prec: autionary measures. The heat-
ing is by steam. The engines are located in a separate house.

A characteristic feature of this library, which, indeed, exists else-
where, though only in a few places, is the open-shelf department. A
collection of 17,000 volumes, in wall cases in a room 70 by 30 feet
large, is here, under supervision, directly accessible to the public, not
only to read on the spot, but particularly to choose for home use.
Anyone can go right up to the shelves and take the books out. This is
not u so-called reference library, such as every important library pos-
sesses in reference works, dictionaries, and the like (there is also such
a reference library of 2,000 volumes), but the section was established in
order to afford the reader an opportunity to select the books them-
selves instead of by title only. This method is so popular that in
1899 each book was loaned out on an average sixteen times. The col-
lection also includes German (877) and French books. Of the 17,000
volumes, 10,000 relate to fiction.

In 1899, 888,000 volumes, all told, were loaned out to 57,000 per-
sons In three hundred and five days,’ of which 67 be cent were fic-

« A book may be taken out for fourteen ane and once renewed for an equal length
of time. Some new books are lent for one week only. Whoever keeps a book over
time is fined two cents a day. The comparatively large total of fines is composed
almost entirely of fines for one, two, or three days. Compensation must be made
for damages, and lost books must be replaced. Whoever fails to meet his obligations
receives no more books.

In the New York State Library at Albany (previously referred to) there isa fine of
one cent a day for keeping a book over time. For taking a book out of the library
without having it entered the fine is 50 cents. The rules are here very detailed in
their conception (see EKighty-first Annual Report of the New York State Library,
1899, pp. 63-67). Formerly in asmall town of Ontario, Canada, a borrower was fined
a half a farthing per shilling of its value for every drop of tallow which he allowed
to fallon a book. This rule is so curious that I can not refrain from. mentioning it.

>The Boston Public Library lent out 1,200,000 books in 1898, the public library
in Chicago 1,300,000 (1899, 1,700,000), that in Philadelphia 1,600,000, that in Cleve-
land 900,000, St. Louis 600,000, Pittsburg 100,000, Indianapolis 300,000, ete.

tion,” 8 per cent literature, 6 per cent history, 35 per cent travels, 3
per cent natural sciences, etc. As many as 684,000 volumes were
borrowed from the main library, and 204,000 from the seven delivery
stations in the city, which have been established for the convenience
of the public, or indirectly through schools or traveling libraries (see
below). In the reading room, moreoyer, 37,000 volumes were called
for from the main library. Since the opening of the public library,
out of 2,000,000 volumes loaned, about 1,000, to the value of $725,
have been lost in two years and a half; the present rules, however,
encourage the hope that the number will diminish with time. Other
special arrangements are the following:

Series of books are loaned to schools for a considerable time, accord-
ing to the choice of the teacher. The children take these books home
with them. Thus in 1899, 22 primary and secondary schools, with
358 classes, received 153,000 volumes and 5,000 pictures. Further,
well-selected series, called traveling libraries, are likewise loaned to
certain institutions. Thus in 1899, 127 series, with over 4,000 books,
were loaned to 28 fire-engine houses, to 7 police stations, and to 5 hos-
pitals (for the employees), which in all brought 8,600 into circulation.

Especial care is also bestowed upon a children’s library, which is
muchfrequented. It is for childrenunder 14 years ofage. Whenthey
come with dirty hands they are sent into the wash room. In a pleas-
ant, well-lighted room, with pictures on the walls and adorned with
growing plants and cut flowers, 9,000 books are displayed in open wall
‘ases, freely accessible, under proper supervision, toeverybody. Four
thousand of these books are fiction. In 1899, 115,000 volumes were
lent out of this department for home use. Even colored picture
books are lent to smal! children. On Saturday mornings and Sun-
day afternoons the assistant in charge spends an hour reading to the
children or telling them stories. At Christmas time an exhibition, of
books which are suitable for presents is held and printed price lists
are distributed; for example, see List of Books recommended as
appropriate for Christmas Gifts to young Folks (November 28, 1898,
6 pages), in which is noted the age for which each book is suitable.
A library assistant 1s in attendance to give advice on this matter to
visitors. There are also printed reading lists—for example, Ameri-
‘an History for young Folks (4 pages).

About once a month lists of the new acquisitions are posted on bulle-
tins and larger lists are from time to time printed; for example, ‘* No.
17, July 1, 1899, recent additions: History and biography, sociology, °
science and arts, philosophy and religion, general literature, fiction”

«The fact must not be lost sight of that such books may be read much more
quickly than others, and that only good ones are procured. See explanatory
remarks on this subject by Herbert Putnam, North American Review, CLX V1, 1898,
p. 664.

(4 pages, with 230 titles). Reading lists on special topics are also
published, for example, Good books on Electricity for popular Read-
ing (2 pages); Greek Sculpture, in connection with the Exhibition
of Casts in the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy (3 pages); Interesting
Books for Boys and Girls from 14 to 18 Years (9 pages). Other publi-
vations are: Finding list of history, travel, political science, geograpby,
anthropology (224 pages, octavo, October, 1898), and Descriptive Cata-
logue of the Gluck Collection of Manuscripts and Autographs in the
Buffalo Public Library (149 pages, on handmade paper), July, 1899.

Every year there appears an annual report, the third one for 1899,
with 55 pages and a map of the city, on which all delivery stations,
also the schools, fire houses, and police stations, to which the library
gives books, are designated in red. The last annual report of the
Buffalo Library appeared in 1897, as the sixty-first (with 90 pages),
and the last annual report of the Young Men’s Association, in 1886,
as the fiftieth (with 51 pages). The first report of the Buffalo Library
counts, therefore, from the fifty-first, while the public library since
its establishment in 1897 has numbered its reports from one, and states
on the title page that it is at the same time such and such a year of
the Buffalo Library. The third was the sixty-fourth year.

Branch libraries are now being established in the city.

With the wise administration which we have described, and the active,
constantly increasing patronage of the people on the one hand and the
prospective great development of the city and the devotion of its citi-
zens on the other, a much wider sphere of activity and a future rich in
blessings may confidently be predicted for the Buffalo Public Library.“

“In the State of New York there were, in 1898, 408 public libraries with a ratio of
1,800,000 books to 7,000,000 inhabitants; altogether 983 libraries with 5,400,000
books (Extension Bulletin, No. 27, University of the State of New York, 1899, pp.
48 and 50). :

In the State of Massachusetts, in 1899, there were for 3,000,000 inhabitants 344
public libraries with 3;700,000 books, each of which were lent on an average more
than twice. During the last fifty years $8,000,000 in cash have been donated or
bequeathed for the buildings and books, besides presents of books and other collec-
tions. In 1899 only 7 towns with less than one-half per cent of the total popu-
lation were without a public library. In 1895 Massachusetts had in all its libraries
combined over 7,000,000 books, to the value of $10,000,000 (9th Report Massachu-
setts Free Public Library Committee, quoted in American Review of Reviews, Sep-
tember, 1899, p. 324).

In the State of New Hampshire public libraries, like public schools, are obligatory.

In the United States, with its 70,000,000 inhabitants, there were, in 1896, 4,026
public libraries, society libraries, and school libraries of over 1,000 yolumes each,
a total of 38,500,000 books and pamphlets, of which 2 libraries had over half a mil-
lion books, 4 between 300,000 and 500,000, 28 between 100,000 and 300,000, 69
between 50,000 and 100,000, 115 between 25,000 and 50,000, 411 between 10,000 and
25,000, 630 between 5,000 and 10,000, and 2,727 between 1,000 and 5,000. Of public
libraries with over 3,000 volumes there were 627, with a total of 9,000,000 books,
which were loaned out for home use on an average three times a year (United States
Bureau of Education No. 232, 1897).

IV.—CHICAGO.a

Chicago, on the shore of Lake Michigan, is the metrupolis of the
State of Illinois, which, with a population of 4,800,000, ranks as the
third largest State in the United States. In 1890 Chicago numbered
1,700,000 inhabitants, a population surpassed by but one city in the
entire country. In 1887 the place was still in the midst of a marsh,
with only 4,000 residents. In 1871, when the population had grown
to 300,000, the city was almost blotted out by fire, so that we might
be justified in dating its real foundation from that time.

Its architecture exhibits more evidence of an American national
style than is seen in the other great cities of the eastern part of the
country. In originality, in youthful vigor, and in the astonishing
rapidity of its development Chicago excels all, with the prospect of a
yet greater future. The motto ‘tI will” is often found on the alle-
gorical figure of the city, and the words appear to me most suitable
to indicate the energetic, aspiring character of its citizens.

9. FIELD COLUMBIAN MUSEUM.

The Field Columbian Museum is a private association, established
in August, 1893, during the World’s Columbian Exposition, under the
name of the ‘‘Columbian Museum of Chicago” for ‘‘art, archeology,
science, and history.”? In June, 1894, it was rechristened in honor of
Mr. Marshall Field, of the immense wholesale and retail establish-
ment of Marshall Field & Co., who, immediately after its foundation,
presented to the museum $1,000,000, on the condition that a sum equal
to half that amount should be given by others. This condition was
fulfilled within a few weeks by the generosity of some 1,200 persons,
who subscribed from $1 to $100,000 each. A fund amounting to about
$250,000 from these gifts is invested.

The chiefs of the different departments of the Columbian Exposi-
tion, especially those of mining, metallurgy, anthropology (in its
widest sense), and transportation, had sought, in accordance with a
plan devised as long ago as 1891, to bring together materials for a
permanent museum. In this enterprise Prof. F. W. Putnam, now of
the Peabody Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was especially
active, and at the breaking up of the exposition there was a most
favorable opportunity for obtaining all kinds of collections.“ This

Amerika, by Dr. A. B. Meyer.

>The corporation was especially founded ‘‘for the accumulation and dissemination
of knowledge and the preservation and exhibition of objects illustrating art, arche-
ology, science, and history.”’

¢ For instance, there were bought, at the close of the exposition, the collections of
Paraguay, Peru, Java, and Samoa, as well as those of the dealers in natural history,
Hagenbeck, of Hamburg, and Ward, of Rochester, New York, the last costing
$100,000. Large collections were given by Russia, Japan, Corea, Ceylon, Siam,
British India, Mexico, Central America, and all the States of South America.

peculiar genesis explains the vast scope of this Chicago institution,
perhaps embracing too wide a field, as we shall see, and accounts
for the astonishing repletion of its overcrowded cases, as well as
for the fact that the museum, in true Chicago style, could, from its
very beginning, claim a place among the leading museums of the
world, an apparently solitary example in the history of such institu-
tions. There was also the extraordinary advantage of having available
among the exposition buildings one of more substantial construction
than the rest, the one provided for the exhibit of fine arts. It is a
wide-spreading structure in Ionic style of the Spanish type, designed
by Charles B. Atwood. It has about 6 acres of ground space avail-
able for exposition purposes, or almost double the space of the old
market at Dresden, and stands by itself in Jackson Park, an area
of 521 acres, immediately on the shore of Lake Michigan, which
is nearly as large as the Kingdom of Bavaria. The main front of
the building faces north toward the city; the south front (Plate 15)
faces a large pond; the east side is toward the lake. Its orienta-
tion is of no importance to the collections within as the building is
lighted throughout from above. The ground plan (fig. 32) shows two
naves, 110 feet wide, 77 high, and 556 and 333 feet long, crossing
each other at rightangles. To these are adjoined transverse and long'-
tudinal halls. A central rotunda is 140 feet high. There is annexed
to the north front on either side, a pavilion 223 feet long by 133 feet
wide, divided into separate rooms. The building with its classical
style presents an imposing effect from a distance, but on near approach
its beauty is marred by the dilapidated aspect of the exterior, for the
white covering of the brick wall is here and there damaged and broken
away. The simple division of the interior is very favorable for finding
one’s way intheextensive building. The navesare provided with galler-
ies (fig. 33), but the ordinary character of an exhibition hall, in which
most heterogeneous objects are placed near together,“ generally prevails,
and there is lacking that intimate charm which can only be afforded by
a building designed for its special purpose. Although it would be easy
to imagine a better building (the American Museam of Natural History
in New York, already described, being incomparably better) yet there
are in Europe new museum buildings much inferior to that of the Field
Columbian Museum. Its principal faults are defective skylighting in
some portions and insecurity from fire because of the large amount of
interior woodwork. It is to be hoped that it may continue to be spared
the disaster of a conflagration. The extraordinary quantity of mate-

«For instance, a few steps from the collection of shells there stands furniture
belonging to the Danish poet, Hans Christian Andersen, and also stocking and glove
machines from Chemnitz dating from 1834. This must somewhat perplex the lay
public, irrespective of the fact that the green upholstered sofa with two similar stools,
even though it belonged to a celebrated poet, impresses a visitor strangely in a
museum of high standard.

rialexhibited in the building, and the contracted space devoted to work
rooms and storerooms, has caused such a crowded condition that 2 new.
building is already talked of, and indeed it is thought that the museum
may be united in one large building with the John Crerar Library,
described beyond. This combination would be an excellent plan, and
Chicago would thereby be doing an admirable deed.“ With such a
condition of affairs and with the rapid development of everything in
that country, it is not worth while to give a detailed description of the

are similarly covered to a thickness of an inch and a quarter. The

the city fire department, together with the employees of the building,
have charge of the service, day and night, without and within. These
three firemen each perform sixteen hours of service during the
twenty-four hours, and the entire building is inspected every four
hours, the inspection being registered by a service clock of the

laid before the director every morning. The doorkeepers and watch-

men are drilled twice a month. The greater number of those em-

be considered as veteran firemen. The electric conduits in the build-
ing, which supply 40 are lamps, are carefully inspected daily and put
in order. In each of the four wings of the principal building the
following apparatus is distributed: 2,500 feet of hose upon racks and
reels, together with a hose carriage; 4 25-foot fire ladders; 7 fire poles
of various lengths, with iron points and hooks to break through ceil-
ings or to pull them down; 26 fire axes and 145 fire buckets. There
are 8 fire hydrants within the principal building and 12 on the exter-
ior, also 4 hose reels upon the galleries and 1 in each of the two side
buildings. There are also provided and distributed 1 large chemical
fire extinguisher of 55 gallons capacity, supplied with 300 feet of
hose, to reach every portion of the building; 42 chemical hand extin-

guishers, each of + gallons capacity, and 148 filled buckets with auto-
matic covers—100 of them on the roof, filled with about 442 gallons
of water. There is also available the special high-water pressure
system of the park, and definite arrangements are made with the city
fire department for such extra service as may be needed. Fourteen
fire alarms are distributed throughout the building, which give sig-
nals, both in the room of the fire watch and in the distant room of the
director. The offices in the upper story are provided with a mer-
curial automatic fire-alarm system. Upon the roof a series of mer-
curial thermostats have been placed which, at a temperature of 175°
F., give the signal of alarm in the room of the fire watch, so that the
situation of the fire is at once known.“

On account of the isolated location of the museum, everything that
ingenuity can devise has been done to diminish the danger from fire
liable on account of the combustible nature of the building and Fant
ture, and to meet accidents that may occur. I have described this
system in such detail to show how careful people have become ina
city which has burned down within the memory of man. But with us,
too, just as much care 1s desirable, for it is much more important to
prevent a fire in museums, or to stop it when first started, than to
extinguish it with the aid of the fire department, for the water thrown
by engines is as destructive as the fire itself. A proof of this was
eiven in January, 1901, at the fire in the old pathological institute of
the Berlin University, in charge of Professor Virchoy, where valuable
material was destroyed by the water thrown to extinguish the fire.

It impresses a German to find in America that generally no light-
ning rods are in use—none at all, for example, on this museum. In
Saxony there are very stringent police regulations in this regard. On
inquiry about this matter in the United States I was told that the elec-
tric wires served the same purpose.’ Considering the great dryness
which exists in summer, together with the high degree of heat in the
United States—I myself, on September 5, 1899, at 5 p. m., endured a
temperature of 98° F. in Chicago’—I believe that in ane of all the

careful precautionary regulations, the expensiy e collections of the
Columbian Museum are seus ee in ns bole and I

« For security ee bareiney aw eaharear in ihe nace of gems, as well as one at

an hour. There are also electric alarms in the same hall.

bT much doubt the accuracy of this view, for the protecting effect of lightning
rods can not, in many cases, be denied, though nowhere in the United States are
they required by police regulations, and what is more to the point, the fire insurance
companies do not demand them; while on the other hand, mortgagees frequently
demand security of buildings against cyclones.

¢ This is blood heat. The highest observed temperature within a short time before
was 100° F., on July 16 and 17, 1887. This was first exceeded on July 11, 1901, when
it was 102° F,

would congratulate the city should it become able to place this collec-
tion in a fireproof structure.

When the museum was established the following seven departments
were provided: Anthropology, geology, botany, zoology (exclusive of
ornithology), ornithology, industrial arts, with two sections of trans-
portation and railroads, and Columbus memorials. In 1896 there was
added to this the department of monographic collections with the two
sections, that of printing and graphic arts and musical instruments.
In 1897, however, the departments were reduced to five: Anthropol-
ogy, botany, geology, zoology (exclusive of ornithology), and orni-
thology. Under anthropology is now embraced everything that was
formerly in anthropology, industrial arts, transportation, railroads,
Columbus memorials, printing and graphic arts, and musical instru-
ments. That there exists any essential reason for creating a depart-
ment of ornithology distinct from zoology is not apparent. The
anthropological department occupies the entire east wing (1-18, eth-
nography; 81-94, America), the entire central pavilion (Europe, Asia,
Africa, and America and statues in the rotunda), a portion of the west
wing (30-33 industrial arts), and the entire east portion (transporta-
tion). The botanical department occupies all the galleries (fig. 33);
the geological department the entire west pavilion and two halls of
the western wing (35-36); and the zoological, including the ornitho-
logical department, the greater portion, or two-thirds, of the west
wing (19-27, 95-108). The installation is mentioned somewhat more
in detail in the legend to fig. 32.

The administrative organization is as follows: A board of 15 trus-
tees, 6 of whom constitute a quorum, is divided into four committees,
executive, finance, building, and audit. To this board are subject the
salaried officials of the museum, at whose head stands the director
who, up to this time, has not been a trained scientific man. Each
section has a curator. Besides this, the anthropological and zoolog-
ical sections have each an assistant curator, and the geological two
assistant curators. The assistant of the anthropological section has
special charge of ethnology. One of the geological assistants has
charge of paleontology. There are altogether nine professionally
trained employees, a number entirely insufficient for this large museum.
Finally, there is a librarian, a recorder, and 79 subordinates, including
2 collectors, 1 osteologist, 3 taxidermists, 20 preparators, writers, ste-
nographers, etc., 2 modelers, 1 inspector of buildings, 4 engineers, 6
cabinetmakers, + painters, 12 doorkeepers, 5 laborers, 16 attendants,
and 3 fire guards.

The force is employed from 8.30 a. m., in some cases from 7 or 8,
until 5 p. m. or till 5.30 p.m. in June, July, and August, with an
hour for luncheon. The hours of labor in American museums are
usually longer than in those of Europe.

4. Life members, now 81, who have contributed $500 at one time.

5. Annual members, now 415, who pay $10 a year.¢

The expenses of the museum from October 1, 1898, to September
30, 1899, were, approximately, $129,000,’ divided as follows: Salaries,
$63,570; heating and lighting, $8,102; repairs and alterations, $10,560;

In 1899-1900 the total receipts were $125,052, of which $85,000 was
obtained from the sale of securities. The interest on investments had
dropped from $21,589 in the previous year to $8,034.

The rich merchants of Chicago would do well to so endow the Field
Columbian Museum that it would not be necessary to encroach upon
its capital for its ordinary running expenses, but if not the city fathers
will certainly undertake this duty. I do not in any case doubt, how-
ever, but that the finances of the museum will be put ona sound basis
through the generosity of Chicago millionaires.

The museum is open tothe public from 9a. m. to4, or until 6 p.m. in
June, July, and August. On Saturdays and Sundays admission is

Natural History in New York, with a population of 2,200,000, has 752 members

bThis is more than the yearly expenses for the entire 11 royal collections for arts
and sciences in Dresden. In 1899-1900 the expenditures of the Columbian Museum
reached $120,861.

free; on other days there is a charge of 25 cents for adults and for
children 10 cents. The pupils of the elementary and secondary public
schools always have free admission. Umbrellas and walking sticks
must be left at the entrance and a fee of 5 cents is charged for check-
ing. The annual average attendance for the past five years has been
250,000. In 1898-99 the number of visitors was 223,304; in 1899-1900,
266,899;% 21,447 and 28,110 of whom paid admission fees, and on the
pay days there were also admitted free 9,714 and 15,216 during those
years. On Saturdays there came 54,490 and 56,717, and on Sundays
137,653 and 166,856. The highest numbers on any single day were
6,709 and 6,839; and the minimum, in 1898-99, was 5. I am convinced
‘that the number of visitors would be much greater if the museum were
more accessible. From the central portion of the city, it takes an hour
and a half by carriage, or half an hour by the electric or elevated roads,
to reach the vicinity; or by rapid-transit road, running along the lake
shore, ten minutes. For most visitors, however, it means a day’s trip,
for the city of Chicago covers L87 square miles.? Surely the number
of museum visitors would also be increased if the entrance fee was
abandoned. In 1898-99 the fees amounted to not more than one-
twentieth of the entire budget, the average attendance on the 260 pay
days being only 82 persons, while in 1899 and 1900 this average was
108 visitors for whom the entire apparatus of surveillance must be
put in operation and the entire collection be submitted to the injurious
influence of light. Thus it happens that a greater number of persons
annually visit the incomparably smaller museum of the Academy of
Sciences in Lincoln Park (see below), which allows free admission and
is centrally located. In 1897 a patron of the museum endeavored to
make it useful also for public instruction, and to excite the interest of
youth, by offering forty prizes of from $5 to $50, amounting in all to
about $300, fo the pupils in the public schools of Illinois, for the best
essay of 2.000 to 3,000 words, made without assistance, describing the
museum or single portions of it. The result was ‘* very satisfactory ”
and the attendance to the museum naturally increased.°

“The American Museum of Natural History in New York was visited in 1899 by
458,451 persons; in 1900 by 523,522 persons. (See also p. 330. )

>It has three streets that are each 25 miles long, oras far as from Dresden to
Schandau. Berlin covers 36 square miles. From this, considering the approxi-
mately equal population—1,700,000—an idea can be obtained of the scattered arrange-
ment of the greater part of Chicago. Dresden covers 18 square miles for a popula-
tion of 500,000.

“See Publication No. 24, Report series, I, No. 3, p. 197 for 1897. Details of the results
have not been published. There were about 70 essays handed in. The Carnegie
Museum in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, a new and very active institution, for which a

418 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

In March, April, October, and November, lectures are given on
Saturdays, usually by foreign men of science, but also by the museum
employees, for the most part illustrated by projections, for which pur-
pose, in 1899-1900, 2,022 lantern slides were provided in the museum
collections. Some of the employees of the museum, as the curators
for botany, geology, and zoology, are at the same time teachers in the
University of Chicago.

The publications, undertaken on a large scale, were begun in 1894.
There are six series, the volumes being issued in parts or pamphlets:
The annual reports, and series on anthropology, botany, geology,
zoology, and ornithology. Up to the end of September, 1900, 8 vol-
umes, comprising 50 single treatises, were almost completed, the
greater part being zoological material. The museum also published
in 1899 a quarto work of about 400 pages on the birds of eastern North
America, by Charles B. Cory, with many bundreds of illustrations.

plates.’’ It was open only to pupils of the secondary schools and the two sections
(fourteenth and thirteenth grades) of the uppermost class of the Pittsburg grammar
schools. The prizes were especially assigned for each class; 1 each for the fourth,
third, second, and first year of the secondary schools and 1 each for the fourteenth
and thirteenth grades of the grammar schools. (I refer to my remarks upon the
American schools in the chapter on The University of Chicago.) There were awarded
in 1899 thirty-eight prizes, ranging in value from $2 to $25, having a total value of
about $250. The subject was ‘‘ What I learned from five objects in the Carnegie
Museum.’’ The essay must not exceed 1,200 words, and 33 weeks’ time was allowed
for writing it. The pupils were advised to obtain information about the museum from
their parents and friends; they could also use books, and the teachers were specially
directed to further the matter, but it wasa point of honor thatin the composition of
the essay itself no helpshould bereceived. There were 401 essays handed in, of which
245 were by girls, who also, with but one exception, won the first prizes. The prize
winners were from 12 to 21 years of age. The Indian groups were selected 173 times;
the flamingos 120 times, the mummies 121 times, the camel group 86 times, the
mastodon 64 times, ete. In all 220 different objects or groups of objects were treated.
The boys inclined to choose themes which treated of war, sport, or business activity ;
the girls, those having historical significance and birds. In the above-cited publi-
cation the names of the competitors were published as well as the essay which won
the first prize. This was by a young girl 18 years old, and was entitled ‘‘ Fragments of
Creation.’’ She had treated of the following five subjects: The human skull, arm,
and hand inthe animal series, the gar pike, the Rosetta stone, and the meteorites.
The introduction and conclusion as well as the transitions between the different parts
were conceived in a religious spirit. In 1900 there were obtained for a similar prize
competition 843 essays. (See W. J. Holland, The Carnegie Museum, in the Popu-
lar Science Monthly, LIX, 1901, p. 19.) Pittsburg had, in 1899, among 321,616
inhabitants, 46,266 school children, of which 1,823 were in the three secondary
schools. As these essays came chiefly from the secondary schools their proportion
to the 1,823 pupils was something enormous. In the three secondary schools there
were 23 male teachers and 41 female teachers. In the 79 elementary schools there
were 27 male teachers and 878 female teachers. The schools cost the city in 1899
$875,000. (Report concerning the public schools for 1897 to 1900, Pittsburg, 1900, 123
pages, with tables.) [These prize-essay contests were also continued in 1901 and 1992
with great success. ]
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 419

A Guide appeared in 1900, in its sixth edition, 176 pages, with many
plans; it could be made more useful to the visitor by indexes. From
the sixth annual report, forming a volume of 512 pages, with 54 plates,
together with the Guide and a little pamphlet entitled An Historical
and Descriptive Account of the Field Columbian Museum, 90 pages,
with illustrations and plans, a good idea can be obtained of the origin
and condition of this great museum.

The library contains 24,000 volumes, and is excellently catalogued
upon cards alphabetically and systematically arranged according to
Dewey’s system somewhat modified (see p. 399 of this paper).
There is even a topical catalogue of the most important papers in
scientific journals and in the publications of scientific societies—an
unusual but very useful thing. The library also has a duplicate card
catalogue of the John Crerar Library (see p. 451), with 23,000 titles,
arranged alphabetically with its own cards—an excellent plan for the
scientific worker in Chicago.

The catalogues of the collection are kept in the most scrupulous,
careful, and exemplary order, for which purpose extra clerks are re-
quired. In the archives are preserved all the original documents of
the collections, which are each provided with a permanent number,
and receipts are always taken when these documents are delivered to
one of the department employees. Besides, the registers are kept in
books and on ecards. Up to October, 1900, there were 94 volumes
of the catalogue, with 215,000 entries, as well as 75,000 cards.¢

The eacthed of cataloguing, to which I paid especial attention in the
anthropological department, is as follows:’? Every newly acquired col-
lection, immediately upon its arrival, is assigned a number and given
an accession card. This card bears, in addition to a serial number, the
name of the collector, the manner of acquisition of the collection by
the museum, the place and date of the collection, the numbers assigned
to the specimens, and a general statement of the nature of the collec-
tion. This card, together with any lists or correspondence that relate
to the collection, is deposited in a stout envelope made for the pur-
pose, which also bears the name of the accession. This envelope forms
part of the historical file of the department. Both accession card and
envelope, together with all correspondence, are made out in duplicate,
one set being retained in the office of the curator, the other being sent
to the recorder’s office. Each object in the collection is then num-
bered to correspond with the number on a ecard which bears the name
of the object, with a drawing of the same if deemed necessary, the
tribe or locality whence the specimen came, the name of the collect tor,

>In America everything, as one may say, is registered upon cardboard of definite
size, and the catalogues are therefore called ‘‘card catalogues.’’ This ‘‘ card cata-

490) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

and, finally, the location of the specimen in the museum—whether it be
on exhibition, and, if so, where, or whether it has been placed in the
temporary or exchange storage room. The information contained on
the cards is next transferred to the department inventory books under
the appropriate numbers. Each card, as well as each entry in the
inventory, also bears the accession number. The cards are then col-
lectively filed in a card cabinet under the accession number, each group
of cards being provided with an index card. ‘The collection is finally
indexed in a single large volume under the name of the collector, the
locality, and the tribe. The advantages of this system are many and
obvious. It can be determined at a glance what collections are in pos-
session of the department from any locality or tribe in the world, as
well as ascertained what collections the department may possess from
any individual, as collector or donor or through purchase. From the
accession number under any of these entries one can refer to the his-
torical file for the lists or for the correspondence; or with the same
accession number he may turn to the inventory book or to the card
catalogue for a description or for the exact location of the specimens
themselves. On the other hand, from the number of any given speci-
men, reference may be made at once to the inventory book for, its
locality or tribe; or, from the accession number there given, the cor-
respondence in the historical file relating to the collection as a whole
may be consulted. The method of cataloguing used in the botanical
department is also very complete in its way; it is described in the
Annual Report for 1899-1900, pages 440-442.

In such a complicated system there is naturally much clerical work
necessary, but the expense of this is more than repaid by the saving
of time which the excellent arrangement occasions. One can with the
greatest ease obtain information concerning anything, and on the basis
of its documents prepare exchange catalogues, of which already several
extensive ones have appeared. In 1899-1900 the increase was 64,921
numbers in 286 entries; in 1898-99, 177,348 in 305; in 1897-98, 74,200
in 362.

The officials undertake many extensive collecting tours, the expenses
of which are usually defrayed by patrons of the museum. When I
was there in September, 1899, I met only a few of the museum staff.
The curator of the zoological department was on the Pacific Ocean;
that of the ornithological department, with his assistants and a prepar-
ator, were in Honolulu; the curator of the botanical department bad
that year made a voyage to the West Indies; the assistant curator of
the zoological department had, among other collecting tours, made
one to the Pacific coast; the curator of the anthropological department
had made a tour to northwest America and other regions; and the
assistant curator of paleontology had made explorations in Wyoming.
In the year 1896 the curator of the zoological department had under-
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 42]

taken a journey to Africa for the purpose of collecting specimens for
the museum.

The labeling of the collection is carried on with the greatest energy,
and eyerywhere one gets the impression of a museum well provided
with descriptive and instructive labels, particularly well printed.
The tendency to instruct the public in this respect is, in Americ:
generally, more marked than with us. The printing establishment of
the museum prepared in 1898-99 over 7,000 labels, some very large,
3,500 of them for the anthropological department, and furnished also
95,000 other pieces of printed matter. In 1899-1900 nearly 8,000
labels were printed in the museum, 2,700 of which were for the
zoological department, and there were also furnished 100,000 copies
of other printed matter.

Fic, 34.—Field Columbian Museum. Case with movable partition,

The photographic establishment of the museum in 1898-99 prepared
548 negatives, 280 prints, 253 lantern slides, and other material; in
1899-1900 the corresponding figures were 1,148, 1,075, and 343.

The arrangement and installation of the entire museum gives, in
general, a pleasing impression, especially in the geological and botan-
ical departments, which offer many models, notwithstanding that in
particular cases the methods and kinds of installation do not always
come up to strict requirements. It should be remembered, however,
that the whole work has been accomplished within a few years, and
that some appliances already existing had to be accepted. There are,
for instance, remaining from the exposition of 1893 many cases and
desks with clumsy wooden frames and sides; but neither does the

arrangement of a case or stand inclosed by glass doors and especially
constructed for lighting from above; itis about 9 feet long, | foot broad,
and 7 feet high, its base being 2 feet high; the woodwork is clumsy
and the arrangement of the shelf supports, with four standards, is
obstructive. Similar stands are used throughout the museum and do
not generally add to its beauty; when, however, the exhibits do not
need to be inspected on all sides, these stands are arranged as a four-
sided well-lighted pyramid that excellently answers the purpose for
which it is constructed. The new cases are of mahogany or of other
wood polished black. In showing the collection of skeletons, black
backgrounds are often employed, as in several Kuropean museums,
but the setting of the skele-
tons contrasts disagreeably
with this black background
and their mounting is some-
times rude.

While some of the great
mammal and bird groups
are displayed in a strikingly
beautiful manner, there were
many of inferior character,
for example, in the ornitho-
logical department, although
the museum is developing
so rapidly that perhaps even
these may now have given
place to better ones.

In the botanical department
‘there were found very prac-
tical herbarium cases which
showed a good utilization of
space (fig. 39). They are
nearly 7 feet high, 3 feet 4
inches wide, and have each
45 compartments, 5 inches high, and 3 sliding shelves. They stand in
pairs, back to back, with sufficient intervening space for the doors to be
pushed back out of the way. The doors slide on tracks, which also hold
each pair of cases rigidly together. The door is hinged at gy, hung to

and then swung shut. These cases offer many advantages and are
ingeniously designed, but they should be made of iron instead of wood,
for they would then be more secure against dust and fire. (See also
Report for 1899 and 1900, p. 450, Plate XLVI.) This remark will
apply likewise to the wooden cases of the entire museum. In this con-
nection may be mentioned the pasteboard boxes still used, instead of
tin, for the display of minerals and the like. I do not doubt but that
the Field Columbian Museum will in time have recourse to iron cases,
be it only as a security from fire, and that then excellent designs will
be brought forth by the advanced technical skill of America.“ Better
cases are also to be desired on account of security against dust, for in
the great halls of this palace, designed for a former exposition and
all communicating with each
other, the dust spreads un-
impeded over everything and
is very troublesome.

result is that there are fre-

reducing the number of exhibits space could be found for work-
rooms, now quite insufficient throughout. There have been provided,

and horizontal, as ‘‘clumsy and ugly forms’? (fig. 17), which are the only ones with
which he is acquainted, one would not think the prospect of such a reform in America
was very favorable. The honored curator of the mineralogical section of the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History in New York, who has an interest in and knowl-
edge of the technical side of museum administration possessed by few experts,
would certainly change his view if he beeame aware of the better results in this line
in Europe.

In conclusion I will hastily sketch the museum collection, though
from its great profusion I can give the reader but a feeble idea of its
exhibits. I must limit myself.to enumerating a few principal objects.
Anthropological departinent.—The archeology and ethnology of
North America stand in the foreground. Among the most interesting,
archeologically, is the collection of the Hopewell Mound group in
Ohio, with a large series
of copper, stone, and bone
ornaments and imple-
ments, among which is a
deposit of 8,000 stone
implements. Well repre- ee

sas, Wisconsin, Michigan,
New Jersey, Tennessee,
California, New Mexico,
and Arizona. There is
also a large collection of
casts from the sculptures
of Yucatan.

In the ethnological field
there are very complete
representations of the
Kwakiutl and Bellacoola
of the northwest coast,
the Kulanapan of California, the Hopi of the Southwest, the Sioux and
Algonkins of the Plains. I further mention houses, totem poles, and
the other ethnographical equipment of the Haidas of Alaska, Eskimo
materials from North Greenland, Alaska, and Eastern Siberia, group
exhibits of the villages, houses, and industrial occupations of the Zuni,
Hopi,” etc., with life-size figures. One of the seven Hopi villages,
Oraibi, in Arizona, is—so to speak—here reproduced complete, so as
fully to show the interior and household life of the Indian of to-day.
To this is added a collection of over 4,000 pieces of prehistoric pot-
tery from the near-by Hopi ruins. Further, there are exact imita-
tions of nine altars and sand mosaics as they are used in ceremonials
of the Hopi, whose religious life is especially well represented,

The ethnology of South America is illustrated by extensive collec-
tions from Colombia, Venezuela, British Guiana, and the region of
the Gran Chaco; the prehistoric, by similar ones from Colombia,
Eeuador, Peru, and Chile. Melanesia is the best represented in the
South Sea division. Asia is at present represented from its eastern
coast alone; the Korea collection is especially good; Java and Ceylon
also offer some very notable objects used for theatrical and dramatic
performances. Africa is represented only by special regions, such as
the Congo basin and Portuguese Southwest Africa.¢ In European
archeology there are shown many reproductions of the bronzes in the
Naples Museum, as well as
Sal bronzes and wall decora-
ics | tions from Boscoreale and
Grecian, Roman, Etruscan,
and Pheenician originals.
About a thousand objects
from the Swiss lake dwell-
ings are shown, and some
also from prehistoric Eng-
land. I can not, however,
begin to enumerate all.
The section of transpor-
tation is given a prominent
place, and one may say that
no age and noland has been
disregarded. It begins by
showing how _ primitive
peoples carry their chil-
dren and their goods, shows
all sorts of litters, pack ani-
mals, and other beasts of
burden, carriages with
solid and spoke wheels, and
at last illustrates the entire
development of the locomotive. It is impossible to touch upon every
thing in a limited space. The peoples of America from Alaska to
Brazil are especially well represented. So, also, the development of
railway travel, shown with great completeness, is of historic interest.
Serial cards indicate how the railways of America have increased
every ten years. The water and wagon transportation is also shown
in just as complete a manner. One may see a ‘‘Scythian” cart

The physico-anthropological collection is very notable, and is among
the best in the world. It must be the richest in human skeletons,
although only in American ones. I did not get the exact number of
skulls and skeletons, but there must be several thousand. Many hun-
dreds of skulls and skeletons are from the tribes of the northwest
coast, the Blackfoot, Algonkin, and allied Indians, from the mounds
in Ohio and the prehistoric graves in New Jersey. The Flatheads of
the Columbia River are represented by a series of complete skeletons,
with 100 artificially deformed skulls; Peru with over 150 complete
skeletons and many skulls. There are also 90 skulls from New Guinea,
some Maoris, and a small series from many regions of the earth. An
instructive exhibition is made in 33 cases of selected pieces from
the large collection. There is one case devoted to each of the follow-
ing: Craniometric nomenclature, sexual variation in the skeleton,
variation in the cranial sutures; varieties at the glabella, pterion, and in
the orbits; variation in the nasal region and degrees of prognathism;
variations in the intermaxillary suture, mastoid process, shape of
palate, and direction of palatine sutures; variations in the lower jaw,
lachrymal bones, and occipital condyles, the clavicle and scapula,
the dentition, the sternum and bones of the pelvis, the humerus and
the tibia, the femur; skulls of different capacity and various cephalic
indices; skulls showing variations in the orbital, nasal, and dental
indices; in the facial, palatal, and bizygo-stephanic indices; variations
in the scapula, lumbar, sacral, and pelvic indices; pathological skulls,
artificially deformed skulls, trephined skulls from Peru. Six cases are
devoted to disarticulated skeletons showing pathological or anomalous
characters; one to models of the brain; one to casts of cranial cavities,
including those of animals; two to skeletons of gorillas and men of vari-
ous races; two to the chemical constituents of the human body; one to
life masks of the races of eastern Asia and of Oceania. There is added
to this an anthropometric laboratory, with the needful instruments.
This department was specially organized by Dr. Franz Boas, a Ger-
man, now at the American Museum, in New York, and professor in
Columbia University. I have described the physico-anthropological
collection with more relative fullness because a similar one can hardly
be found elsewhere, and it may perhaps lead to imitations. The pres-
ent competent curator of this department, after a visit to European
museums, expressed the opinion that as to the exhibit of physical
anthropology none of them could compare with the Field C olum bis an
Museum in Chicago,“ wherein I agree with him.

Botanical department. —There was obtained from the World’s Fair,
beautifully installed both in geographic sequence and ina monographic
manner, an unusually extensive collection of woods, forest prod-
ucts, such as fruits, resins and the like, fibers, and other economical
plant products, in a profusion that is, perhaps, without a parallel.
Especial attention is given to products having a domestic and practical
value, such as cotton, tobacco, hemp, grains, tea, coffee, spices, dye-
stuffs, ete. Forestry is illustrated by monographic exhibits. From
one and the same tree there are shown blocks, leaf-bearing branches,
and flowers; photographs of the species at various ages; pieces of its
bark, cross sections of the stem, planks in various stages of working up
to a polished condition; besides a colored chart of the geographic distri-
bution of the species, statistical data concerning its weight, hardness,
density, and heating value, so that any one, from his own standpoint,
may obtain information and instruction. In this way ‘* Latin” Amer-
ica is especially well represented, and there are economical botanical
products from Russia, Japan, Korea, Ceylon, British India, Johore,
North America, Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, British Guiana, Venezuela,
Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Paraguay, and the Argentine Republic.
Recently there has been installed a complete collection of the timber
trees of North America. The berbarium contained, in October, 1900,
about 80,000 plants, and is, like the whole vast department, especially
well organized. Particular attention is paid to American plants, and
the collection is rich in North American and West Indian species.

Geological department.—The collections are arranged in two series—
one systematic, the other economic. The systematic is divided, as is
usual, into paleontological, mineralogical, lithological, structural and
dynamical sections. The paleontological section is chronologically, and
within each period zoologically arranged. Muchattention is given tothe
collecting of fossil vertebrates of the western United States, a region
specially rich in this regard. I will name, as an example, the material
obtained in South Dakota in 1898 relating to Z¢tanotherium ingens
Marsh, a mammal resembling a rhinoceros and nearly 16 feet long, and
the extensive material collected in 1899 in Wyoming relating to land
reptiles (dinosaurs) known as Brontosaurus, Creosaurus, Camptosaurus,
Morosaurus, ete., the last named having a femur over 5 feet long.“ ‘The
mineralogical section is arranged according to Dana. In the section
of structural and dynamical geology there are shown, among other
things, cave products (stalactites, stalagmites, and the like), in a
ereat cave naturally arranged. The economic series illustrates the
occurrence of minerals and ores which have economic importance,
the processes by which they are extracted, and their application in the

« Recently there have come to the Columbian Museum dinosaur remains of yet
larger animals, among which is a femur over 6 feet 6 inches in length. (See E. 8.

arts and industries. These economic collections are arranged in sys-
tematic series with geographic subdivisions. Because of the profusion
of this material I can only mention a small part: Comprehensive
exhibits of combustible minerals of the United States according to
their occurrence, their composition, their economic value, ete.; the
building and ornamental stones of the United States; the kinds of mar-
ble and such like, also those of many European countries (in cases like
fig. 38); the metallurgy of the precious and base metals, the metal-
lurgical process being represented by groups, in which pieces of the
ore, the smelted product, and the combustible materials used are dis-
played with the help of labels and converging and diverging tines
showing what materials go into the furnace and the resulting products,
with all the intermediate stages; their composition, peculiarities, uses,
etc., are given in printed descriptions, so that anyone seeking infor-
mation can get all the necessary data at once. <A striking collection
of precious and decorative stones, and a collection of meteorites which
fills an entire room, are conspicuous.

The vast and copious collection of this department is remarkable
for its instructive and often elegant installation. I would have been
glad to include illustrations of entire rooms like those shown in the
annual reports of the museum. I should certainly not neglect to
mention the model of the moon, 18 feet in diameter.

Zoological and ornithological department.—The most striking feature
of this department is, first of all, the excellent representation in large
glass cases of groups of animals, such as orang-outangs, chimpanzees,
nose apes, musk oxen, black sheep from Alaska, gazelles, antelopes,
leopards, hyenas, herons, etc. Sometimes the secondary work of
artificial foliage and the like is somewhat obtrusive, but these groups
excellently fulfill their object of attracting the general public, though
they also require much space. The systematic collection has not yet
received the same consideration, for the proper preparation and instal-
lation of a large series of animals can not be accomplished in a short
time. The skeletons stand in a room adjacent to the systematic collec-
tion. About 10,000 species of shells are shown in horizontal cases of
not especially pleasing construction.

The Field Columbian Museum would do well to somewhat contract
its programme and lop off several branches which have led it too far in
its attempt to embrace all possible lines of human interest, so that it
may devote itself in a scientific way to the natural sciences and to
ethnography still more than it does now. There is still clinging to it
too much unimportant material from the World’s Fair, but one can
only look with real admiration at this museum, which has sprung out
of the earth in so short a time. If it secures, as is expected, a new
building, I do not doubt but that it will astonish the world by its
wbility and compete with the first museums for precedence.
430 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

10. CHICAGO ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.

In the year 1857 an association ‘* to promote science” was organized
under the name of ** The Chicago Academy of Natural Sciences.” It
began at once to make collections, but the commercial crisis of that
year was unfavorable to the development of the enterprise.

In 1859 and 1865 the association was incorporated under the name
‘The Chicago Academy of Sciences.” Encouraged personally by L.
Agassiz, they laid in 1863 the foundation of a scientific museum, which
was deposited in a house near the present city hall. The collections
were enlarged with the help of expeditions, but in 1866 some of them
were destroyed by fire, after which accident the academy began the
construction of a fireproof building 50 feet long 55 feet wide, and 50
feet high, not far from the present Auditorium.

In 1868 the first meeting was held in the new building, which was
of brick, the floors of iron and tiles, the stairs and main doors of iron,
and the windows with iron shutters. The museum was in the upper
story, 28 feet high, a large space with broad galleries, and was soon
filled with precious collections, including 10,000 glasses with crustaceans
and 8,000 species of marine shells, and the library was also largely
increased.

In 1871, at the great conflagration, however, everything was
destroyed, although at the beginning of the fire they had trusted in the
supposed security of the building, but not the least thing was left of
the collections. Not more than twelve days after this disaster it was
decided to erect a new building on the same spot. In that building
the first meeting was held in 1873, but in consequence of pecuniary
difficulties the academy was obliged to leave these quarters in 1886 and
store its collections.

In 1891 a plan was considered of associating with the new Univer-
sity of Chicago, but the members preferred not to sacrifice their inde-
pendence, and when a rich citizen, M. Laflin, offered to spend $75,000,
and the Lincoln Park board offered a space and $25,000 for a new
building, the architects, Normand S. Patton and Reynolds Fisher, of
Chicago (now the firm Patton, Fisher & Miller), were charged with
making the plans. They designed a building of 750 feet frontage and
a dome 130 feet high, of which plan, however, only the northern-
side building could be executed (Plate 16). It lies isolated in Lincoln
Park, in the northern part of the city, at the lake near the zoological
garden and the hothouses of the park, and called after its patron, who
died in 1897, the ‘* Matthew Laflin Memorial Building.” The museum
was opened to the public in 1894. This wing (part) is 133 feet long,
61 feet wide, and 70 feet high, and is fireproof. The wooden floors
are laid on cement; the cases, desks, and other furniture, the doors
and sash are of wood, With respect to the fireproof construction I

received the following information from Mr. Patton, whose acquaint-
ance I had made at the Union League Club of Chicago:

As to the materials of construction, the iron columns are covered with porous

a cotta and finished by plastering with Keene’s cement upon the terra cotta.
Tue fireproofing of the building in general is effected by application of hollow tile
known under the name of ‘‘soft tile,’ or ‘porous terra cotta.’”’? They are prepared
oi © mixture of clay with sawdust in the kiln. The sawdust is destroyed and the
clay becomes porous or spongy by this process.

The floor arches are of 6 by 6 inch tile, segmental in form, and of about 11 feet
span, and resting upon iron beams which run from the outside piers to the corre-
sponding columns of the interior.

The plaster is laid directly upon the under side of the tile arches, so that the
ceilings consist of a row of arches.

The roof is constructed of iron supports which, like rafters, ran up and down the

oe at intervals of about 5 feet. On the upper side of these rafters T supports, 24
ints broad and of the same height, are laid horizontally at intervals of 2 feet, upon
vy rest hollow tiles that have the form of books and therefore are called book tile.

ook tile form a continuous surface upon which the roof tiles are laid. First
uae book tile are covered with a waterproof mass and then the so-called ‘‘Spanish
style’’ of roofing is applied, where the roof tiles are nailed directly down upon the
book tile that let the nails enter easily and also hold them firmly, as they are of
pe  osclay. All parts of the iron frame of the roof are made fireproof by a cover of
plastered hollow tile; there is no uncovered metal in the whole building. The
security against fire of the vaulted ceiling over the centra! hall of the museum is
effected in the following way: This ceiling is made of a steel frame covered by
expanded metal lath, and plastered from below with hard cement mortar. After
this plaster has become hard, the exterior (upper) side was plastered the same way,
so that the ceiling consisted of a solid mass of plaster about 2 inches thick, in the
midst of which the expanded metal is embedded. Thereby it was made so solid
t’ person could walk on it.

4ue interior walls of the building are covered with vertical wooden furring 16
inches apart; this is covered with expanded metal lath that is plastered. Here the
wooden furring would not allow a fire to spread, because it is inclosed in front by
the plaster, on the back by the brick wall, and above and below by the fireproof
ceiling.

The staircases are of iron.

In many buildings columns are treated as disagreeable necessities, which are spaced
as far apart as possible with little regard to anything except to make them incon-

‘uous. In this building the columns are treated as the most important feature in
ure interior architecture. The design of the building proceeded from the interior
outward. In the first place, it was determined what should be the proper dimen-
sions of the cases in which exhibits are to be placed. It was found that 34 feet was
the most economical and effective width for the double cases, and that 63 feet
between the cases gives an ample width of alcove; therefore it was arranged so that
there should be a case against each pier, and the piers are to be placed 10 feet on
centers, and the columns are to be exactly opposite the piers. To this arrangement
the exhibition cases fitting in between the columns and the piers on the outside
walls, form a part of the architecture of the building; and the windows coming, in
every case, in the alcoves between the cases give a most perfect lighting to the speci-
mens. This arrangement of columns will give to the interior an effect of size much
greater than reality, and will prevent that appearance of emptiness which museum
buildings are apt to have.

As we predict that the exterior of the building will be a prominent landmark in
Chicago’s architecture, we venture the assertion that the interior, small though it be,
439 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

will attract much attention from those interested in museums. There are many
museums which appear to have been erected on the theory that they were simply
storage warehouses for the safe-keeping of specimens. This building is designed on
the theory that a museum is a place for the effective display of specimens; in which
case it is important to bear in mind that bare white walls and mean architectural
surroundings will belittle the value of whatever is contained therein; while a rich
architectural setting will give to the public a true impression of the value of the col-
lections displayed for their benefit. @

The plan of this finished wing is one of the best that I ever have
seen in a museum, and it is to be regretted that only such a small part
of the whole could be executed. The construction was developed from
within, since the most perfect use of space was based upon those
dimensions of the cases and the space between them that are con-
sidered the very best, and not until then were the interior and exterior
architecture fitted to these demands. Therefore, as can be seen in
the plans of the first floor
and part of the second or
gallery floor, figs. 40,41, the
cases all around stand ex-
actly between the columns
and the piers between the
windows, and they all re-
ceive their light from the
side except two of them,
that could just as well have

position. This is, I believe,

the most correct principle, but the dimensions, without exception,
have all been made too small; from this fact, besides some others, the
people crowd too much in the spaces between the cases. But this only
happened because the means were so limited that the architects were
compelled to use minimum measures. Otherwise they would have
built on broader plans.

The building has the following horizontal divisions (fig. 42):

1. A high basement for laboratory work, packing, heating, store-
rooms, etc., and a dark chamber, partly cemented and furnished most
practically.

“Mr. Patton quite recently, 1903, wrote me in respect to these remarks:

It is a matter of no small satisfaction that my prophecy should come true only
ten years later, and that your description would recognize the scientific method
which had been applied to the planning of this building. I realize that the dimen-
sions are all minimum, and should be increased, if possible, for any building likely
to have such large crowds as visit this building, but when visiting New York City I
was struck with the enormous waste of floor area from the lack of attention given to
the spacing of the windows, so that comparatively few exhibits could be placed in a
given space, and my object was to give the maximum capacity consistent with proper
lighting and access.

2. First floor with entrance hall, that is used for exhibition purposes
(in the middle a large group of flamingoes), library, herbarium, besides
a lecture room (with book shelves at the sides), offices and rooms for
the park board.

3. Second or main floor which, together with the third floor, forms
a large hall with light from above (Plate 17). This hall has in its cen-
ter a room for large animals (mammoth, glyptodon, gorilla, bison,
muskox, American elk, groups of lions, etc.); in the cases all around,
the vertebrates; also some ethnographical specimens.

4, Third floor or gallery: All around the railings of the gallery are
horizontal cases for insects (in the illustration, Plate 17, are seen some
other objects in these cases,
the pictures having been
taken some years ago); in
the cases at the window sides
are mollusks and lower ani-
mals, paleontology, geology,
and mineralogy.

5. The attic, which runs
all around the vaulted ceil-
ing with skylight, perfectly
illuminated, and at the out-
side walls of which stand
storage cases with birds,
shells, lower animals, fos-
sils, and minerals; this attic
-is perfectly fireproof, which
fact I especially emphasize, as this is rarely the case in Germany.

It would be difficult to devise a better and more practical use of
space. Beside the stairs an elevator runs from the basement to the
gallery.

Adopting a combination of ceiling and side light (if for any reasons
the first one had to be employed too), the main advantage of the build-
ing lies in its being exceedingly well lighted.

The height and width of the windows and the walls between are so
excellently arranged that the light flows through all the rooms, and the
effect of the ceiling light, which is relatively small, could almost be
spared. Besides the reflection of the horizontal cases at the gallery

‘ailing, which as everywhere with ceiling lights is very annoying, is
diminished by the light flowing abundantly in from all sides. I know
a number of similarly built museums, but they either use only or
almost entirely the ceiling lights, which arrangement has many dis-
advantages, or the side light is not made use of either so profitably or
so completely.

The wooden cases and desks with their sharp yellow wood color are

not up to very strict requirements, but everything was done to make
them dust tight, as far as wood will allow it. Some of the larger cases

fact I have mentioned above at the Field Museum as entirely anti-

quated and not very recommendable. Since the building in other
respects is totally fireproof, and after the sad experience of the two
conflagrations, it would certainly have been more advisable to use
iron furniture instead of wooden.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 435

Since, as we said above, the dimensions of the cases have without
exception been proportioned to the dimensions of the entire building,
and as I believe this to be the only correct view in buildings of this
kind, I shall dwell upon this point a little more explicitly. Generally
the architect plans a museum without considering the consequences
that are connected with the breadth of the windows and the spaces
between, nor does he regard the proper length and depth of the
cases. Very often the officers of the museum do not support him suf-
ficiently, since most of them do not care for these specialties; besides,
the architect generally does not ask their advice at all. In this way
most museum structures are erected schematically, and then the dimen-
sions of the cases must be arranged according to the dimensions of
the building, instead of vice versa. In such cases it very often hap-
pens that the show cases are set up without consideration of the
existing distribution of light. Examples are odious, but it would
really be hard to mention a museum at the erection of which the pro-
ceedings were as judicious as at the erection of the Academy of Sci-
ences in Chicago, although the dimensions were necessarily too small
on account of insufficient funds.

feet depth, and a minimum free space between them of 63 feet. This
gave a result of 10 feet minimum as the distance between the centers
of the piers, and a breadth of 5 feet for the windows. The free spaces
in the central portion and at the corners are more liberal in size. In the
gallery the depth of the somewhat low cases is almost exactly equal to
the breadth of the walls between the windows, as seen from fig. 41,
and, according to my opinion, is the most suitable proportion.
Although in this instance the intervals are very narrow, the typical
dength of the cases, which was varied only now and then, was deter-
mined at 10 feet 10 inches, with a breadth of 3 feet 6 inches, and a
height of 7 feet 7 mches, with one door 3 feet 2 inches in breadth and
6 feet in height, having one plate of g@lass for each of the three diyi-
sions of the length. Ido not want to criticise these dimensions, but
mention them only to.show how considerately the architects pro-
ceeded, and how much one dimension depends upon the other, if once
established.

According to need, a partition and shelves are put into the cases,
and I only have to say that the shelf brackets are adjustable, so that
horizontal or slanting shelves may be used; there are also arrange-
ments made to separate the case divisions from each other by parti-
tions, according to the doors. Therefore, all the cases, as well as
their interior arrangements, can easily be interchanged. All these
things seem very simple and self evident, but such a care for details
we tind but rarely, if ever, among our museum of architects.

The length of the cases determined exactly the position of the iron
436 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

columns that run through from the basement to the top and are, as we
have said, fireproof covered. They all stand (see fig. 40) at the
interior side of the cases. This also seems to be simple, natural and
evident, but only look at the museums in regard to this point! At the
American Museum of Natural History in New York City, that mod-
ern, magnificent edifice, the front was constructed without taking into
consideration the dimensions of the cases—a mistake that, as stated
above, is made almost everywhere—and the columns inside in the halls
do not correspond with the piers between the windows, so that the
columns and the show cases come into conflict with each other. With
how many museums is this the case! In the Academy of Science of
Chicago the cases determine the interior architectual divisions, and
this is the only correct principle. In the same way, the gallery rail-
ine, with its desk cases, is organically connected with the architecture,
not attached externally, as we so often find.

I again emphasize my opinion that I do not consider the chosen
dimensions to be the most happy ones, although they were directed
by the narrow space available. I only tried to show the rational
principle that was hereby followed and was worthy of imitation.
The building, situated in a very much frequented public park at one
of the greater traffic streets, must be built to offer a pleasant view
externally, and therein the architects were very successful with a

modern French Renaissance style. For the same reason the front
must be made of a good material (limestone), and as the means were
not sufficient to make it longer, the height was necessarily proportioned
to the dimensions of the available ground, and consequently the height
of the single stories had to be reduced to a minimum measure, or else
it would have been too uniformly square. If the architects had not
thus been hindered their intellectual planning would have produced
still better results.

Since the distribution of light is so very excellent in the building,
I think it to be an advantage to mention the height of the single
stories and the situation and size of the windows.

The space under the horizontal cases is provided with cases with
drawers for scientific collections; it is not hollow and covered in, as
at the Field Columbian Museum. The arrangemnt with interchange-
able drawers is good. Excellent order exists everywhere.

Great care is applied to the art of taxidermy, but some of the older
specimens are not ornamental to the museum.

The labeling is with instructive descriptions printed at the museum,
and the work is executed in general with the greatest care and a great
deal of pains, as shown in fig. 48, the interior of the case of fossils.
In the drawers the objects lie loose in cardboard boxes, and in the
exhibit collections they rest upon labels of cardboard with paper
pasted on, therefore there is no permanent arrangement such as could
be attained with thin metal plate; but the strength of the cardboard
and the color of the paper are selected after much experimenting, and
the appearance of the tablets is excellent, at least for the present.

Fic. 43.—Chicago Academy of Sciences. Case showing fossils.

But in time the cardboards warp and the cream color fades, for the
museum is open to the public daily from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. (on Sunday
from 1 to 5 p. m.), and the collections are so long exposed to the light
that they must become injured sooner than necessary. The labels are
3, 6, and 8} inches long, and 2, 4, 6, and 8} inches wide, not to mention
extra sizes. They are either printed directly on the cardboard or on
paper of the same color, and pasted on the board.. The printing types
are especially attractive. The paper used is called ‘star manila;” the
‘ardboard is a seventh of an inch thick, with a border of black gummed
paper, and covered with the manila paper so that a black rim remains.
If a black background is required forthe objects, the yellowish paper
is again covered with black paper, as on paper boxes. The whole
arrangement is neat, and you rarely find so much care taken in other
museums.

According to European custom, the name ‘‘Academy of Science” is
rather misleading, for an academy of science in Germany means an
438 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

institution comprising all branches of letters and science, while the
Chicago institute is an association that has for its object ‘Sto improve
and propagate scientific knowledge by lectures and publication of
original essays, by a library and museum, as well as by such measures
as are adapted toawaken interest and promote scientific research.” In
this quotation the words ‘‘ scientific” and ‘‘ science” mean almost exelu-
sively natural science. In former times Americans used high-sounding
titles everywhere, as in hundreds of lower-grade schools that called
themselves ‘‘universities,” and the ‘*Academy of Science in Chicago”
thus bears an improper title that was accepted in 1857. I think the
correct name would be ‘* Natural History Society of Chicago,” and
so it should be changed. The academy is divided in six divisions:
Astronomy and mathematics, photography, chemistry, geology, ento-
mology, and biology. The association has ordinary and extraordinary
members, who pay a fee of $5 a year (the ordinary also pay an entrance
fee of $10); life members, who pay a single fee of $500, and patrons,
who pay $2,500 at one time. It also has honorary and corresponding
members. The board consists of a president, a vice-president, a sec-
retary, and a treasurer, with ten trustees, among them the president
of the Lincoln Park board. Only eight persons receive salaries—a
curator, the secretary, a preparator, a clerk, a supervisor, three jani-
tors, which, even for this small museum, is an unsatisfactory number
of officers. With the supervision of the building during the time
visitors are admitted, only two persons are charged; the public, in
general, controls itself. The curator of the museum, a professional

man, is in all his plans dependent upon the decisions of the trus-
tees, who are nonprofessionals; a fact that is not very fayorable to
the progress of the museum. This kind of obstacle does not exist to
purchase commis:

ee

such a degree in Germany, unless it be in certain
sions.” The impairing influences, however, are even here not want-
ing, but lie more in those who have to do with assigning the moneys,
and who are less appreciative of the educational value of the museum,
and thus, as is the casein America, they economize at the wrong end.

The annual revenues of the academy are $5,000 from the Lincoln
Park administration, spent for salaries, and the fees of the members,
amounting to $1,500, spent for administrative expenses. The park
board also pays for heating, illumination, cleaning, and repairs of the
building, and pays the three janitors. If more money is needed for
administrative or for purchasing purposes, or for expeditions, ete.,
appeal is made to the liberality of the members or the public, and
always successfully, though until now in very modest limits compared
with other similar institutions in America. In 1900, $8,000 was
expended.

A special division with its own publications, the Natural History
Survey of Chicago and environs or vicinity, was established in 1892.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 439

The academy issues Transactions (two vols. in quarto, with 35 plates,
1867-1870), Bulletins (two octavo volumes since 1883), Annual Reports
(1895-1897), Catalogues for exchange, and Bulletins of the Natural
History Survey (formerly Geological and Natural History Survey),
four of which were issued and several others are in preparation.
These publications are treatises especially on the branches of paleon-
tology, zoology, and botany of the country. The library is almost
exclusively augmented by exchanging the above publications, the pub-
lications of more than 200 other institutions, and contains 10,000 vol-
umes and several thousand pamphlets.

The meetings of the academy in which scientific lectures are given
take place monthly, and besides these, weekly popular scientific lectures
are given during the winter season. In 1900 twenty-five such lectures
took place and were patronized by 7,000 persons. The lecture hall
holds about 300 persons.

The museum had 300,000 visitors in 1900, from 25 to 5,000 daily.

The increase in the collections amounted to 7,600 specimens in 1900,
1,000 of which were by exchange. The entire number of specimens
was 150,000, among them 75,000 mollusks, 30,000 arthropodes, paleon-
tological and botanical objects, 15,000 each, 5,000 mineralogical objects,
and 4,000 birds.

The museum of the Chicago Academy of Science will certainly develop
itself from these existing beginnings, for it contains even now many
original and suitable features, and the building itself must be consid-
ered as a model of a smaller museum building. On account of the
careful planning of the whole, and especially on account of the practical
views the architects so preeminently followed, it would be greeted with
the greatest satisfaction if the rich citizens of Chicago who patronize
museum interests would at this time not only favor the Field Colum-
bian Museum and the Art Institute, but also help the academy to such
a success as it deserves by reason of its modest yet praiseworthy accom-
plishments, compared with other great American institutes. A city
like Chicago, with its extensive area, should not only have two great
museums for natural science, but they are really a necessity. There-
fore a “‘crescat, floreat” is certainly in its place.

Il. CHICAGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

The Chicago Historical Society was founded in 1856, and in 1857
incorporated by the State of Illinois. Its object is to institute and
encourage historical inquiry, to collect and preserve the materials of
history, and to spread historical information, especially with regard
to the Northwestern States. In 1868 it occupied its own building,
whose construction had cost $60,000, but the great Chicago fire in 1871
wholly destroyed it, together with the entire collection of over 100,000
440 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

objects, books, etc., having a total value of $100,000. In 1872 the
ganized, but in 1874 a second time lost its collections
by fire. In 1877 it was organized anew and soon installed in a tempo-
rary building. Its present structure at 142 Dearborn avenue, not very
far from the Academy of Sciences (see p. 480) and the Newberry Library
(see p. 459), was begun in 1892 and the society moved into it in 1896.
It was designed by Henry Ives Cobb, architect of the Newberry Library
and of the University of Chicago, in a Romanesque style, and cost
$190,000, which was contributed by the members. Unfortunately a
ground plan of it could not be obtained. The collection contains pic-
tures, including 75 portraits in oil, manuscripts, historical reminiscences
of Chicago and the Northwest, prehistoric objects, together with a
library of 26,000 volumes and 60,000 pamphlets, relating chiefly to
historical matters. This library is placed in the back part of the second
story, where the high windows are seen in Plate 18.° The museum is in
rooms on the ground floor and on the second floor. In the right wing
in the illustration is a large and lofty lecture hall. All of the rooms
are particularly well lighted.

What makes this structure uncommonly interesting and wherein it
is unique, as far as I am aware, is the fact that, made wise by two
grievous disasters, an absolutely fireproof building has been produced,
in which the use of wood has been entirely avoided. All is of stone,
brick, cement, and the like—iron and glass. The only combustible
things that I saw there, besides the books, papers, and collections,
were the curtains and carpets in the auditorium. The entire structure
consists almost wholly of large intercommunicating rooms, each of
which can be closed off by iron doors, so that it forms a ‘‘ safe” by
itself. The city furnishes the electric ight. It is heated by natural
gas brought from a distance of over 150 miles. The large, open,
heating rooms in the basement, besides, are entirely isolated. Window
frames, doors, stairways, book stacks, show desks, and similar strue-
tures are made of ironand stone, as are also all utensils and furniture,
such as writing desks, tables, chairs, and the like. The shelves to the

society was reor

iron book stacks are stone slabs. The neighboring houses, some of
which are very high, as will be seen from Plate 18, can, on this account,
hardly be considered as a danger, although one would be glad to see
them farther away.

The right conception here shown of a secure building seems to me
well worthy of imitation, for I amof the opinion that in this way, and
no other, should museums and libraries be built and furnished. What,
indeed, hinders this, except the prejudice which exists in many quar-
ters (even in Chicago, as we shall see in the Newberry Library) against
iron, except the designs of those architects who continually build from
the same ‘‘ready-made” plans, formal and without originality, and
except the lack of proper qualifications in those to whom museum
Report of U. S, National Museum, 1903.—Meyer.

interests are intrusted? Ever since the year 1878, when I became
acquainted with the Royal Library in Stockholm, which stands isolated
upon a spacious plaza and is a fireproof building of stone and iron, |
have advocated this principle for museum buildings, but for the first
time in the building of the Chicago Historical Society I found my
idea absolutely carried out, for even in Stockholm they have not
proceeded with such thoroughness.

In the ironwork itself the historical museum does not excel. The
iron is not adequately treated, it rusts at the window frames, under
the tables, ete., because the proper materials were not used in painting
and varnishing.“ Besides, the iron furniture is clumsy and often over
ornamented, although now, at least in America, iron furniture is pro-
duced of ornamental and tasteful design (as already mentioned, p.
380), whose external appearance exactly simulates wood. Just as
clumsy are the iron show desks, provided as they are with a primitive
arrangement for raising the lid that allows the dust to sift in.
Upright cases are not used. The iron book stacks, too, do not show
the neatness usually seen in such work in America (see pp. 371, 382,
399 of this paper), and as I shall describe hereafter, in the Public
Library of Chicago. Book shelves of sheet iron would be preferable
to those of heavy stone, which look clumsy.

In spite of these criticisms I can only again urge that the general
arrangement is in principle entirely correct, in execution excellent,
failing only ina slight degree to meet rigorous requirements, so that as
a whole it is to be most earnestly recommended to all museums for imi-
tation. In my eyes, at least, the Historical Society of Chicago has per-
formed a great service in that it has carried out the idea and especially
that it has created a model. There is at present no published descrip-
tion of the structure, but one is contemplated.

Since 1882 there have appeared four octavo volumes of Collections
besides Proceedings and Annual Reports.” There are four regular sit-
tings during the year.

The society has life members (32 during 1894) who paid a single fee
of $500, annual members (now 180) who pay an annual fee of $25,
besides honorary and corresponding members. It also uses for pur-
chases the interest on its invested capital of $75,000, but has no
support at all from the State or the city. Its yearly income for
administrative purposes reaches $5,000.

12. ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO.

From an art school founded in 1866 rose The Chicago Academy of
Design, which until 1882 was the only notable art center of the city.
In 1879 it was organized anew as the Chicago Academy of Fine
Arts, and incorporated by the State ‘‘for the founding and mainte-
nance of schools of art and design, the formation and exhibition of
collections of objects of art, and the cultivation and extension of the
arts of design, by appropriate means.” In 1883 it was given its pres-
ent name.

First tastalled in rented rooms the society obtained in 1882 and 1885
(obliquely across from its present home) a large piece of ground, upon
a part of which it built, but in 1886 it erected there a fine museum,
100 feet long and S87 feet wide, of a Romanesque style, after plans of
J. W. Root (Plate 21). As this soon became too small it was in 1892
sold for $400,000 to the Chicago Club“ in order that there might be
erected in 1893 the present spacious building, near the edge of the lake,
in the extensive Lake Front Park.

The origin and history of the present building is not without interest.
It shows what advantage a great exposition may be to the development
of acity. We have seen this already in the Field Columbian Museum.
Buffalo, also, in this year (1901), doubtless will obtain important bene-
fits through the Pan-American Exposition (see p. 405). The Chicago
Ex osition in 1893 needed a building for holding congresses, and by
mutual agreement with the art institute this one was built upon a site
belonging to the city, on the lake front, near the busiest section. The
exposition paid $200,000, the art institute $500,000, and the city gave
the site, 425 feet long, on the broad Michigan avenue under the con-
dition that the property rights in the building should belong to it, but
that the art institute should occupy it rent free, so long as they use
it for its present purposes. The art institute therefore presented it to
the city. The plans were made by the architects, Shepley, Rutan &
Coolidge, in Italian renaissance style, the details ‘* classic and of Ionic
and Corinthian orders.” The magnificent bronze lions of KE. Kemeys
flank the broad stairway of approach. The building is 350 feet long,
185 to 225 feet wide (the Dresden gallery of paintings occupies only
about half the space), and 75 to 85 feet bigh from basement up. It is
fireproof, being built of Bedford limestone and brick, but the floors
and window frames, doors, skylights,’ and furniture are of wood, and
in some cases the partitions are wainscoated with it. The steam-heating

“1 had the privilege of frequenting this club. The high, spacious halls, with an
unobstructed view of the lake, together with the conveniences which American
clubs of the first rank offer, make it an uncommonly attractive place of resort.

In some rooms there are mosaic cement floors. It is intended, sometime, to lay
all the floors in this way as well as to replace some of the woodwork with iron.

apparatus is kept ina small, detached building. Natural gas is used
for heating (see p. 440). In the house itself no fire is allowed to be
lighted. The heating coils stand exposed in the middle of the hall,
which is rather unsightly.

The fire service is especially well organized. The building and the
collections are insured by a company which maintains a watch service
for all its large customers. In every room there is an alarm. The
watchman, who carries a lantern and does not use the electricity which
is installed throughout the building, strikes this alarm hourly through-
out the night, and thus a direct telegraphic communication is established
with the watch room of the insurance company, and the official there
knows whether each room has been inspected every hour. If the sig-
nal is omitted at any time some one immediately appears at the build-
ing from the fire-insurance company. Each morning a card showing
the night report is sent to the director of the art institute. Through
these precautions, in the special interest of the insurance company,
great security is obtained, an arrangement certainly worthy of imita-
tion. It is intended, however, to stop the insurance, which is practi-
cable because of the isolation of the fireproof building—on the one side
facing the lake, on two sides entirely free, and on the side toward the
city 175 feet from the nearest buildings, which are also fireproof.
Behind the museum, however, the railroad runs along the lake front,
which, with its vast commerce, may well occasion some trouble.

For economical reasons ventilating apparatus was not provided. — In
the second story, however, panes of the lower skylight can be opened
and fresh air admitted through windows below the roof (see fig. 44,
arrow) into the empty space between these skylights and the fixed
glass roof. On the ground floor air may be admitted by opening the
large plate-glass windows, without crossbars, which turn vertically
round an axis, a practical arrangement worthy of imitation, by means
of which crossbars and their injurious effects are avoided.“ It can be
easily understood that this kind of ventilation is insufficient when the
building is crowded with visitors. In the smoky atmosphere of Chi-
cago, where soft coal is burned, the exterior of the beautiful museum
is defaced in an ugly manner (as are the buildings in Dresden), and
this also occurs in the interior, especially on the plaster casts. This
last drawback could at least be avoided by ventilating with purified
air and closed windows, as I have found done in various buildings in
America (see for example the remarks below on the Chicago Public
Library), an arrangement with which we are unacquainted in Germany.

“The panes are 10 feet high and 7 feet wide. Only every second window can be
opened. To fit tightly some material is attached. Double windows are not consid-
ered necessary. Neither frost nor condensed vapor have any bad effects in winter,
owing to the effective heating. During my visit one of these great window panes
was shattered by a football hurled against it during a game in the adjoining park
meadow.
444 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

In the plans” (see figs. 45 and 46) the building is simply arranged in
a succession of large and small, broad and narrow rooms, and it is there-
fore easy to find one’s way.

The light lines in the plans show rooms that are not yet built, among
which is (20) a lofty hall for architectural casts, which is to be 240 feet
long, 65 feet wide, and 36 feet high, and will soon be taken in hand;
the monumental stairway is also wanting as yet. In the well-lighted

which, as was said, will soon be done.“ As can be seen from the ver-
tical section (fig. 44), there are a few rooms in a half story over the
second floor (the uppermost of the ‘“‘corridors”). There are, in fact,
three of these on the inner side of each wing. These also serve the
purposes of the art school or are used for temporary exhibits con-
nected therewith. The halls of the first floor are well lighted, but
they are too narrow for sculptures. In order to obtain a vista
through the doors of the front halls from one end of the building to
the other, which gives a pleasing effect (Plate 21), a row of casts has
been shoved back (they are set on rollers) against the narrow window

(18), the library (24), and the staircase, when completed, will interfere
with the lighting of the corridors (2, 6, 11, 18), as they can then
receive light only through a shaft. The second floor, including the

with plate glass which renders their inspection difficult, but a few
of the picture halls, furnished with red plush hangings and dark
wooden wainscoting in unusually good taste, are exceedingly charm-
ing, and as they are moderately filled with masterpieces they make,

of tempering the light in the middle of the room with cloth in the

kind with which I am acquainted. The library (24), which likewise
extends through both stories, was not completed in 1899, but is now
almost ready, a patron of the institute having expended $50,000 for it.
The entire cost of the building up to the end of 1899 was about
$700,000. For the completion of the scheme as shown in figs. 45 and
46, $200,000 more are needed, which is now being collected.

The Art Institute is entirely independent and obtains no support from
the city, to say nothing of the State, except that the city, as already
mentioned, gave the ground for a site, in exchange for which it
obtained the property right of the building. The yearly expenditure
for 1899-1900 was about $90,000, the art school costing $38,000, which

was, however, wholly repaid by the pupils. The $50,000 for the
institute proper is divided, in round numbers, as follows: Salaries,
$23,500; cost of temporary exhibitions, $7,400; heating and lighting,
$4,300; printing (17 catalogues and the like, and many circulars),
$2,400; postage, $2,800; insurance and watch service, $2,000; lectures,
$2,300; purchases, $1,000; miscellaneous, $5,000. The receipts were
as follows: Dues of members, $32,000; admission fees, 54,500; sale of
‘atalogues, $1,200; sundry receipts, $6,800; deficit, 87,500.”

At the head of the institute is a board of trustees of 23 persons, who
from their number select a president and a vice-president, as well as an
executive committee of seven and an art committee of five members,
The society had, in June, 1900, 245 *‘ governing members,”’ who are
elected and who pay an entrance fee of S100, and $25 annually; 2,140
annual members who pay a yearly fee of $10; 84 life members who pay a
fee of $100 at one time, which must be invested; and 8 honorary members.
The museum is controlled by a director, with a secretary, a treasurer,
a librarian, and some assistants. There are besides + clerks, | engi-
neer with assistants, 1 attendant with assistants, 1 janitor, 1 house
servant with assistants, 9 watchmen for day and night s alto-
gether 30 salaried employees, exclusive of the teachers at the art school.
But as the director has also to conduct the art school and lecture there
(he is besides a teacher in the University of Chicago), there is placed
upon him an enormous burden of work. The necessary subordinate
heads of divisions are wanting, and thereby the scientific use of the
material of the museum is not assured, a state of things which can not
last. A museum that does not publish lives only for the narrow circle
of its visitors and not for the rest of the world, but since it is wholly
dependent upon and reeeiving from this outer world, it is morally
bound to give an adequate equivalent. In America, as I have already
several times said, there is generally too great parsimony in museum
service, and the employees are thereby overworked. It is also worthy
of remark that an employee in America can not, as in European insti-
tutions, withdraw and intrench himself behind * official business,” but
he must always be ready to talk to anyone and be at anyone’s service.

The collection is open week days from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m., and Sun-
days from 1 to 5 P. m. Admission is free on W ednestlays, Saturdays,

vious year $4,000 due for interest on borrowed capital, but upon appeal there was,
within ten days, $110,000 raised from 60 persons, in sums from $500 to $1,000. Sinee
the organization of the society, $500,000 in cash has been given. Various legacies,
amounting to from $200,000 to $225,000, are not yet available, but are to be kept as
capital. Up to the present time $100,000 is capitalized, for the greater part for
special purposes, such as the purchase of pictures, scholarships, ete.

and Sundays;“ on the other four days a fee ef 25 cents is charged. In
1899-1900 it was visited by 577,421 persons, 17,995 of whom paid.
(In 1898-99 there were 40,491 who paid, because of a separate exhibi-
tion which drew a good many.) The greatest number on any one day
(Sunday) was 10,759; the smallest, 54, ona pay day. This large number
of visitors is very remarkable, for the great Field Columbian Museum
in the same city had in 1899-1900 only 266,899 (in 1898-99 even less,
223,304), chiefly, indeed, because of its distant location. In New York,
with double the population, the Metropolitan Museum in 1899 had
540,000 visitors, and the American Museum of Natural History had, in
1900, 523,522. The reasons for this lie, first, in the favorable location
of ne art institute, near the heart of the city, and then in the excellent
and instructive installation and labeling of the entire collection (quite
a contrast to the New York Art Museum), and perhaps, also, in the
active and aspiring spirit of the inhabitants of Chicago. Besides, the
frequent temporary exhibitions attract a-considerable attendance, an
arrangement adopted either not at all or only to a limited extent by
the museums which I have compared above. There are also com-
prised in the total number 20,000 persons who attended the lectures,
and 80,000 represent art school students who are counted each day;
but in any case this comparatively lively interest which the people
take must afford just satisfaction to the men who have devoted their
time and their means to advance the interests of the art institute.

The collection of sculpture appears, from the catalogue of ‘* seulp-
ture and painting,” of September, 1898, to consist of 632 numbers,
almost allof which are casts. Modern sculptors are also represented—
for instance, Barrias, Bartlett, Barye, Cain, Chapu, Daillion, Dela-
planche, Donoghue, Dubois, Elwell, Ericksson, Falgwiére, Frémiet,
French, Gelert, Géré6me, Hasselbere, Houdon, Idrac, Joy, Massoulle,
Mercié, Molin, Peterson, Potter, Rodin, St. Gaudens, St. Marceaux,
Thornycroft, Tilden, Wuertz, and others,’ three of these with orig-
inals. In 1893 the French Government sent to the Chicago Exposition
an extensive historical collection of architectural casts, unique of its
kind, which was assigned to the art institute. It will be exhibited in
its entirety in hall No. 20 when that is completed. I will also mention
LO9 facsimiles in bronze, after originals in the Naples Museum, from
Pompeii and Herculaneum, which were also sent to the exposition;
Grecian, Roman, and Rey ouen antiques, among the last a most rich

a**Tt is the earnest a of thé trustees that every man, woman, and ch ld in Chi-
cago should enjoy the educational advantages afforded by the institute, aad for this
object the galleries are open free on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday.’’ The insti-
tute has the declared purpose of serving the people.

>The British Museum had in 1900 only 689,249 visitors (43,892 on Sundays), with
a population in London of about 5,000,000; the Museum of Natural History had only
485,288; and the South Kensington Museum 846,489 (87,854 on Sundays).

¢Only two of those named are represented in the Dresden sculpture gallery.

and extensive collection of scarabzei, also a large collection of nephrites,”
117 in number (Plate 23), which is, perhaps, only excelled by the col-
lection of Mr. Bishop in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York City. Industrial arts are also notably represented.

The principal attraction of the museum, however, is the gallery of
paintings, with some 500 pictures by over 300 artists, part of which,
indeed, are only lent, but most of them will later become the property
of the institute. Among them are several pictures for which the for-
mer owners paid $30,000 to $40,000, and many for which $10,000 to
$20,000 were paid, almost all being large gifts or legacies. While
with us most collectors sell their pictures already during their life-
time, or their heirs do it after their death, the rich Americans take
pride in bequeathing theirs to a public institution.

The modern portion of the collection, especially pictures of the
School of Fountainebleau, has hardly its equal in Europe, only the New
York collections (see pp. 345, 350) being comparable with it. Of French
artists there are exhibited Benjamin-Constant, Besnard, Rosa Bonheur
(3), Bonnat, Bouguereau (3), Jules Breton (6), Cabanel, Cazin (6),
Corot (8), Courbet, Couture, Daubigny (7), Decamps (3), Degas, Dela-
croix (4), Detaille, Diaz (8), Jules Dupré (9), Fragonard, Fromentin
(3), Gérome (2), Greuze, Gudin, Hébert, Henner (2), Isabey (2), Jacques
(4), Lhermitte (3), van Marcke, Meissonier (2), Michel, Millet (3),
Monet, de Neuville (3), Puvis de Chavannes, Robert, Rousseau (5),
Roybet, Troyon (9), Ziem, and 31 other masters.

Of American artists I will name (partly represented by free-hand
drawings, etchings, etc.,) Abbey (2), Bierstadt, Blum (3), Bridgman (2),
Bristol, Bursh (2), H. and W. Chase (3), Church (5), Thomas Cole,
Cox, Dannat, Charles Davis, Durand, Elliott, Fuller, Gibson, Gifford,
de Haas, Thomas A. and B. Harrison, Hart, Hitchcock, G. Inness (8),
G. Inness, jr.; Kappes (2), Leutze, Lungren, Martin, Murphy, Neal,
Parsons (4), Pearce, Pennell (4), Reinhart (8), Richards, Sargent, Shir-
law (5), Stuart, Thayer, Vedder, Weeks, and J. A. M. Whistler.’

Among the recent painters of other nations that are exhibited (partly
in free-hand drawings) are the following: A.and O. Achenbach, Brozik,
Chierici, Constable (2), Fortuny y Carbo, Gainsborough, Griitzner
(2), Israels (2), Jettel (3), Knaus, Koekkoek (4), Lawrence, Lenbach

@This collection was presented in 1900, together with oil paintings, water colors,
porcelains, crystals, ete., 1,300 objects in all, valued at $300,000. See the catalogue
of The Nickerson Collection, 147 pages, with over 1,000 numbers.

>The American artists are treated by R. Muther in his Geschichte der Malerei im
XIX Jahrhundert, ITI, 1894, pp. 366-405. He makes much use therein of R. Koeh-
ler’s article in Kunst fiir Alle, 8th year, 1893, pp. 225, 241, and 257: Die Entwicklung
der Schénen Kiinste in den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika, and closes with
the words, ‘‘America, therefore, has an art. * * * The American artists are the
most modern of the moderns.’’ Except in art circles very little is known among us
of these things in America.

Michetti, Miicke, Munkascy (3), Pasini (3), Pettenkofen, Reynolds (2),
Schédl, Schreyer, Velten, Verboeckhoven (5), Wahlberg, Webb, Weng-
lein, Zimmermann.

The collection of old masters is certainly not large, as indeed lies in
the very nature of things, but it is worthy of attention. From the
Demidoff auction in 1880 13 selected pieces, mostly of the Dutch
school, were withdrawn, which in 1890 the art institute was able to
buy; these were portraits of Rembrandt, Rubens, van Dyck, Franz
Hals the elder, and Holbein, the Guitar Lesson of Ter Borch, a Family
Concert of Jan Steen, an excellent landscape of Hobbema, the Jubilee
of Ostade, as well as pictures of Teniers the younger, Ruisdael and
A.and W. van de Velde. There are also examples of L. and H. Back-
huysen, Berchem, Brueghel the elder, van Croos, Aelbert Cuyp,
Fouquiéres, Frans Francken the younger, Ghirlandajo, van Goyen,
Guardi, de Keyser, W. van Mieris, Mor, Murillo (2), A. van der Neer,
Perugino (4), Rembrandt, H. Saft-Leven, Sorgh (2), Teniers the
younger (2), Ter Borch, Titian, P. Veronese (2), Wouverman.

I have given this enumeration somewhat at length for the reason
that in Kurope, even in art circles, we are hardly at all aware that
Chicago can show so much in this field.

Besides this permanent collection the art institute holds yearly, in
addition to exhibits of single fine pictures from private collections and
school exhibits, a considerable number of temporary exhibitions (23
in 1900) for which catalogues are issued, distinguished by their taste-
ful appearance, the following, among the more recent, for example:
Catalogue of the Thirteenth Annual Exhibition of Oil Paintings and
Sculpture by American Artists, October 30 to December 9, 1900 (281
numbers, +8 pages); Catalogue of a Loan Exhibition of Selected Works
of Modern Masters, January 8 to 27, 1901 (63 numbers, 24 pages,
among them a series of eminent masterpieces such as it would hardly
be possible to get together in Dresden); Catalogue of an Exhibition
of Works by Chicago Artists, January 31 to February 24, 1901 (198
numbers, 40 pages); Catalogue of Works of Dagnan-Bouveret, March
1-24, 1901 (29 numbers, 16 pages); Exhibition of Works of Elihu
Vedder, March 28 to April 15, 1901 (49 numbers, 24 pages); Catalogue
of the Thirteenth Annual Exhibition of Water Colors, Pastels, and
Miniatures by American Artists, April 25 to June 9, 1901 (376 num-
bers, 51 pages), and others.

The library contains only 2,263 volumes, but including, however,
many expensive works, besides over 16,000 of the large Braun auto-
types. It is open daily, except on Sundays and holidays, from 9 a. m.
to 5 p. m.; on three days also until 7 p. m. for the accommodation of
the pupils of the art school.

In 1900 there were given in the lecture hall for members and their

friends 90 lectures on art, also on music with musical performances;
besides 41 lectures for the art students and 24 for other art associations,

I will briefly mention the art school. It is one of the most fre-
quented in the United States. In 1900 it had over 1,900 students,
740 regular day students, 500 evening students, 794 Saturday students.
In the day classes in 1899 there were 25 teachers, including prominent
persons from without, whose services were temporarily secured, 10 in
the evening classes and 35 students, who received a total compensation
of $29,000. The models cost $3,000, heating and lighting $1,750 (see
also Circular of Instruction of the School of Drawing, Painting, Mod-
eling, Decorative, Designing, and Architecture, 1900-1901, 191 pages,
with many illustrations, 1900).

It is estimated that the collections of paintings, sculptures, antiquities, and other
objects of art belonging to the art institute are of the value of about $850,000. The
cost of the building has been $708,000. The land, 400 feet, estimated on the basis of
the property opposite, on Michigan avenue, is worth not less than $1,600,000, a total
of $3,158,000. The loan collections constantly exhibited are probably of the value
of $300,000. The total amount of cash subscriptions paid into'the Art Institute since
its organization in 1879 is about $500,000.

It is, in fact, admirable and worthy of respect, that so important a
work as that achieved and presented by the Chicago Art Institute
should have been accomplished without great, private benefactions—I
mean ‘*‘ great” in the American sense, 1s they are made to other insti-
tutions in America “— and without aid from the State or city; and it is
difficult, for us at least, to understand why the city, as such, is not
sufficiently ambitious to feel it a duty to support an art society that
has already attained so high a rank, in order that it may compete with
the first in the world. We can only suppose that the city fathers do
not appreciate the educational worth of art.

In one of the last annual reports it is said, ‘‘The Art Institute has
accomplished something; it aspires to accomplish much more.” The
present beautiful product is regarded only as the beginning of a greater
one, and they are already thinking of either adding lateral wings or of
bridging over the railroad and erecting a second building in the park
beyond, nearer the edge of the lake. Who, indeed, who has learned
on the spot to know and admire the enterprising spirit of Chicago, can
have the least doubt but that the future development will go far beyond
such plans ?

13. JOHN CRERAR LIBRARY.

The history of this library is as simple as it is unusualand brief. In
1886 John Crerar, a merchant who had lived in Chicago since 1862,?

“For example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York recently obtained
a legacy of $8,000,000.

> Of Scotch extraction, born in New York. See Appleton’s Cyclopedia of Ameri-
can Biography, new edition; also M. Kirkland’s History of Chicago, 1895, and Will
of John Crerar, who died in Chicago, October 19, 1889, 23 pages.
452 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

bequeathed the greater part of his property, after deducting numerous
private and public legacies,” for founding a ‘‘frée public library ” in
the southern part of the city, as the northern part was already pro-
vided with such an one in the Newberry Library (see p. 459). He
desired the erection of a tasteful, solid, fireproof building. Only such
books and journals were to be included as might create and sustain a
vealthy moral and Christian sentiment in the community; all offensive
and immoral works were to be excluded. Concerning such books, he
said:

I do not mean by this that there shall not be anything but hymn books and ser-
mons, but I mean that dirty French novels and all skeptical trash and works of
questionable moral tone shall never be found in this library. I want its atmosphere
that of Christian refinement, and its aim and object the building up of character.

In 1889 the excellent man died. In 1894 the library was incorpo-
rated by the State, in 1895 organized, and in 1897 opened. I said
above that its Histor y is short, but it nevertheless contains much nee

is instructive and worth noting.

The testator himself had “emt thirteen of his friends as *‘ direc-
tors,” two of whom were his executors. They cooperated with the
other principal libraries in Chicago so that the Crerar Library was to
give special attention to the natural sciences exclusive of medicine, to
the social sciences, and technology; the Newberry (see p. 459) to medi-
cine, history, art, and the humanities; the university (see p. 491) to
philology, and the Public Library (see p. 473) to the whole, more pop-
ular literature for household reading. The idea that by a cooperative
division of this sort the institutions above named would attain the
greatest possible use for the general good is as wise as it is rare, and
il certainly be productive of the most excellent results. The exact
programme of the Crerar Library is as follows:

I. General works.—Bibliography, library economy, cyclopedias,
general periodicals, general societies, exhibitions and museums, psy-
chology, logic, history and geography, cartography.

Il. Social sciences.—Ethies, statistics, political science, political
economy, administration (including public documents), associations and
institutions, education, commerce and communication, customs, folk-
lore, ete.

Ill. Physical sciences.—Mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemis-
try, and mineralogy

IV. Natural sciences.—Geology, paleontology, biology, botany,
zoology.

«The last-named legacies amounted to $1,000,000 for ecclesiastical, benevolent,
and educational purposes, among which were $100,000 for a Lincoln statue, and
$25,000 for the Chicago Historical Society (see p. 439). The will was contested by
the relatives, but without result, concerning which a series of papers, some of which
were quite extensive, were published in 1892.

ing, etc., photography.“

It was concluded, awaiting the time when suflicient capital should
be collected to admit of building a house, to rent quarters, and very
suitable ones were found in one of the many great business houses in
the heart of the city. There was chosen the sixth story of a new
addition to the wholesale house of Marshall Field & Co.,’ near the
principal business centers, the public library, and the art institute.

Recently (in 1900) a portion of the fifth story was added. The nine-
storied building, designed by the architect D. H. Burnham in 1893 (Plate
24), is a vast rectangle 148 feet long and 100 feet wide, with an inner
court. The entire floor was specially fitted in an extremely convenient
manner for the John Crerar Library by the architects Shepley, Rutan
& Coolidge, who designed the art institute and the public library. The
reading room (Plate 25), looking toward the east, is 85 feet long by 50
feet wide and hus 75 seats; the principal library hall (Plate 26) is 88
feet long by 42 feet wide and looks toward the south. The inner court
being of too small dimensions (72 by 40 feet) for the height of the

«The complete scheme has under these 5 divisions 77 subdivisions instead of the
39 here mentioned. It is based on the Dewey decimal system.

>The proprietor of this vast business is Mr. Marshall Field, the Meecenas of the
Field Columbian Museum, which bears his name (see p. 410), and one of the
Meecenates of the University of Chicago (see p. 491). The house carries on a retail
and a wholesale business, the latter in an enormous building in Adams street, made
after the plans of Richardson with striking architectural features, the former on a
corner of State and Washington streets, the new building in which the Crerar Library
is installed and which is connected with the old building, being on the corner of
Washington street and Wabash avenue. In the wholesale department 5,000 persons
are employed; in the retail bazaar 4,000, which number, after the completion of a
second new building, is to be increased by 2,000. The fittings and furniture of the
rooms are prominent, the mahogany cases are of the best make; order and neatness
prevail. The building is fireproof, with external iron shutters except for the ground
floor. One may judge of the refinement that rules here by the fact that extra articles
of food for diabetics can be found on the tastefully designed menu card of the lunch
room which is frequented by hundreds of persons and open daily from 8.30 to 5
o'clock, and where both hot and cold articles of food ean be obtained (there are more
than 150 dishes and nonalcoholic beverages, from 5 cents to 40 cents). At the pres-
ent time the firm is erecting on the corner of State and Randolph streets, adjoining
the old building, corner of State and Washington streets, after the design of the
Architect Graham, a palace of 12 stories out of white granite, so that the State street
front of the establishment will be 425 long. This front will be ornamented with
granite Ionic pillars from 30 to 70 feet high, and the vestibule will be lined with
Carrara marble. The cost will reach $1,500,000. Everything will be fitted up with
the most recent improvements. [Now completed, 1903.] During my visit in 1899
the firm had half of the street in front of the house (about 38 feet broad) asphalted
at its own expense, because the pavement, as is usual in Chicago, was bad and the
city would do nothing. Marshall Field & Co. wished in this way to give an
example for the emulation of others and also to remind the officials of their duty.
454 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

building, which was planned for other purposes, the lighting is not
in all parts sufficient. Including the rooms in the fifth story there
are accommodations for 135,000 books. It would be a mistake to sup-
pose that the elevated situation of the sixth story makes it difficult of
access, for there are three elevators in operation” by which the sixth
floor can be reached sooner than by climbing the stairway even to the sec-
ond floor. The building is fireproof and, like many American houses,
has fire-escape ladders onthe outside; within only extinguishersare used
for security. The floors are covered with cork linoleum of the best
quality, about a third of an inch thick. The house furnishes steam
heat and electric light. There is no special arrangement for ventila-
tion,’ the high rooms, large windows, and elevator shafts suflicing to
change the air. Ina later building it is proposed to seal the windows
hermetically and to force in pleered and purified air, a system now
applied in many places, as in the Congressional Library at Washing-
ton, and of which I shall speak more fully under the Public Library
of Chicago. Recently there has been established a small auditorium
for 30 persons, which can also be used by scientific societies, such as
the Bibliographical Society, the Entomological Society, the Mycological
Society, the Illinois Association of Public Accountants, and the Insti-
tute of Education. There is a special lunch room for employees.
The book stacks are of iron, the other furniture of wood. In spite
of the excellent examples in Boston, New York, and elsewhere, and
notwithstanding the rigorous application of this principle in the
Chicago Historical Society (see p. 439), wooden furniture has been
employed, and this will always offer a point of attack for fire. The
iron book stacks, as wellas most of the wooden library furniture,
were furnished by the Library Bureau of Boston, a grand institution
which I hope to be able to describe in the course of my reports.
Their model for book stacks, however, is not as satisfactory as many
others (see p. 382). It is less stable and the ends are overornamented,
creating a bad impression when a number are taken together. The
shelves are of white wood veneered with oak, instead of iron. The
newer racks in the fifth story are, as I have recently been informed,
steadier, less ornamented, and smoother, whereby the books are léss

the books falling down when the shelf is not full. The vertical arm
has two rounded wings standing out at right angles to it. When
books are quickly put up these prevent the thin plate from passing
between the book leaves and injuring them, as often occurs when
other kinds of supports are used. If an employee of the library takes
a book from a case for his own temporary use he puts a red card in
its place; the books that are given out to the public are recorded only
in the office.

The library now contains 70,000 volumes. The normal yearly
increase has hitherto been about 10,000 volumes. In 1900 there were
of general works, 13,590; social sciences, 16,106; physical sciences,
10,380; natural sciences, 9,184, and applied sciences, 16,435. It may
be remarked that the 14 per cent devoted to the natural sciences cost
three times as much as did the 24 per cent devoted to the social sciences.
According to the agreement which was previously mentioned there
were bought from the Newberry Library 8,023 volumes on natural
science for $16,000, besides 300 special ornithological works for $4,500.

The library is catalogued according to the rules of Linderfelt® and
classified according to the system of Dewey,’ with independent ampli-
fications. The lettering and the numbering are printed with gold
directly upon the backs of the books. The greatest care has been
given in the selection of bindings, and the edges of many volumes are
gilded in order that they may be more easily cleaned in the dusty and
sooty atmosphere of the center of the city. Pamphlets are simply
bound and provisionally kept in cases. In 1900 there were 5,431 vol-
umes bound at a cost of $5,570, or at an average of about $1.19 a vol-
ume. The printed card catalogue, directly accessible to the public,
contained in 1900 over 90,000 cards, 41,000 of them author cards and
49,000 subject cards, among which were also a small number of those
published by the American Library Association.“ There are also
about 30,000 cards to which are added bibliographical information—
from the Concilium Bibliographicum in Ziirich, from the American
Library Association, from the Torrey Botanical Club, from the Depart-
mentof Agriculture in Washington, from the Bibliographie des Sciences
Mathématiques in Brussels, and some others. This bibliographic
information, accordingly, relates to zoology, agriculture, American
botanical literature, names of new botanical genera and species, math-

ematics, and photography. The card catalogue proper of the John
Crerar Library is distinguished by its exact and beautiful execution
and by the originality of its arrangement, which is said to be
unique of its kind. It is arranged in three parts: (1) alphabetically,
according to authors and titles; (2) according to subjects, numer-
ically in the decimal classification, and at the same time chronolog-
ically; (3) an alphabetical subject index to No. 2.¢ Twenty copies
of the cards are printed, for besides their use for the various cata-
logues, sets are sent gratis to the Armour Institute of Technology,
the Public Library, the Field Columbian Museum, the Newberry
Library,’ and the University of Chicago, also to He Northwestern
University, in Evanston, Illinois, and the University of Illinois, in
Champaign, Illinois, under the condition that they shall be arranged
and made accessible to the public. Each title costs the John Crerar
Library 50 cents, including the electrotype. (See below.) The regular
issue of special catalogues is planned and has been begun with a list of
the library placed in the reading room (A List of Books in the Read-
ing Room, January, 1900, 251 pages, Lex., octavo). In the reading
room are about 3,000 volumes. The printing of this catalogue was
made from electrotypes. From the type setting of the card is formed
a thin cast, which costs 6 cents. These casts, numbering 28,354 in 1900,
are preserved in regular order, and in their prescribed serial order,’
are used for printing. In this way both manuscript and corrections
are spared. This catalogue must be the very first book to be pro-
duced in this manner, a plan which was suggested half a century
ago by C. C. Jewett, the librarian of the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, who proposed that a central catalogue bureau should
make shen, casts, from which every library could pe their own cata-

«See, roe more exact information, the Pal cea Report of ‘he John Crerar
Library, 1896, p. 10 (1897), also the Third Report, 1897, p. 18 (1898). The library
also has a fourth kind of card catalogue, the so-called ‘‘official catalog’’ for the
employees, which contains in one alphabet everything that concerns any work that
is extant or taken into consideration, including notices of it, ete., a complicated,
ingenious, and very useful device, a more detailed description of which I do not
givehere. A ‘“‘dictionary catalog,’”’ that is to say, one in which everything is arranged
alphabetically according to authors and subjects as in a dictionary, is not provided.
Compare C. A. Cutter, Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue, 3d ed., Washington, 1891
(U. S. Bureau of Education. Special Report on Public Libraries, Pt. 2.).

bThe Newberry Library has recently declined to receive them, perhaps because
the arrangement and care of 6,000 cards annually occasioned too great an expense
considering the slight use made of them by the public, or because their size did not
fit their ‘‘indexer,’’ to which I shall recur below. The six other libraries, however,
upon inquiry, desired to continue to receive them.

logue.“ The printing is finely executed. Electrotyping is cheaper
than printing.’ A page costs a little over a dollar, or with a large
edition it is reduced to about 55 cents. The titles are arranged sys-
tematically in 9 divisions and 67 subdivisions; within these, however,
they are also systematically, not alphabetically, arranged. The alpha-
petical index at the end, with 2,000 entries, contains, beside authors,
also certain titles. The catalogue is sold in the library for a nomi-
nal price of 20 cents; by mail, 30 cents. There are also printed six
instructive reports, distinguished among similar publications for their
clearness and completeness; a list of current periodicals, 1897, 20
pages, linotyped; the by-laws of the library, 1898, 14 pages, and a few
circulars. In 1900 the library received 2,017 periodicals, at an expend-
iture for subscriptions of $4,261.27 (396 were presented).° In accord-
ance with its programme it offers an unusually rich collection of
scientific journals and publications of learned societies. The entry
book for these is very practically arranged.

The library is opened on week days from 9 a. m., till 10 p. m., and
is closed on Sundays. The books in the reading room may be con-
sulted without formality by anyone, but after use are to be left on
the tables. The current periodicals may be consulted in the periodical
department or obtained for use in the reading room, like the books, by
putting in a card for them. These are returned, after use, to the
desk. The arrangement, according to the Dewey system, is such a
practical one that on the average only a minute and thirty-eight seconds
are required to place any book in the hands of the person asking for
it. Books are lent out only in extraordinary cases, and then for buta
short time, and only such books as are seldom called for. In case of
special researches certain persons personally known to the director are
allowed to take the hooks directly from the stacks. For that purpose
permanent passes are issued. In 1900, 42 persons had such passes, and
32 used them 287 times. Besides, there were issued 730 single permis-
sions to take books directly from the shelves. These books must be
left lying upon the tables. Everything is recorded exactly, so that
not only is the number of books used known, but also to what particular
divisions they belong. In 1900 over 95,000 volumes and_ periodicals
were used. Very valuable and rare books may be consulted only in
the presence of an attendant. The tracing of plans, etc., is allowed
only on celluloid tablets, which can be obtained in the library.

As is everywhere evident, it is the one endeavor of the administra-
tion to make the library as useful as possible. A greater liberality than
is here practiced can not be imagined, and it gives great satisfaction to

know that, notwithstanding the absence of all such obstructions as are
usually employed in Europe, the library since its foundation has lost
only 14 volumes, and some of these, moreover, may yet be found, for
an English library has recently reported the return of a volume that
had been missing for forty-five years.“ During the year 1900, 41,697
persons used the library, more than 20 per cent of them women; that
is to say, an average of 134 daily (maximum 282, minimum 35). The
daily average of evening visitors from 5 to 10 o’clock was 30. Order
cards to the number of 32,653 were issued.

There are 28 employees, 10 of whom are women—5 librarians, 1
treasurer (and secretary), 13 assistants, 4 attendants, 3 pages, and 2
janitors. The hours of service in summer are from 9 a.m. to 5 p. m.;
in winter till 5.30 p. m., with an hour for luncheon. From 5 to 10 in
the evening another shift of employees comes on.

While the chief librarian is the actual leader and soul of the whole,
the institution is controlled by a board of 13 directors, who from their
own number choose a president, 2 vice-presidents, and a secretary.
The directors, excepting the president, are also formed into four com-
mittees of 3 persons each, on finance, administration, buildings and
grounds, and books.

The resources of the John Crerar Library, on the interest of which
it is supported, in 1900 were $3,400,000; the reserved building fund is
$319,000; the reserve book fund, S131, 000, and besides there is a secu-
rity reserve fund of $16,200. The assets are, therefore, almost
$4,000,000. When the building fund reaches the necessary sum the
erection of a special building will be taken up. Quite recently the
chances for this have been much improved, and there is now a prospect
for obtaining a favorable building site.? The financial course has been
very sound from the beginning. It was determined that the capital
should never be touched, neither for the purchase of a site, for the
structure itself, nor for anything else whatever, but that all expendi-
tures should be made entirely from the interests of the funded,
bequeathed capital.

The expenditures in 1899 were for rent, light, etc., $13,331; salaries
and wages, $25,006; printing, $2,303; books, $17,587; periodicals,
$4,468; binding, lettering, repairs, $8,403; miscellaneous, $6,895, mak-
ing a total of $77,994. As, however, the income from the interest
reached $139,944, $61,950 could be applied to the building fund. The
library is insured for $107,000.

The organization of the John Crerar > Librar y is as exemplary as it
is original. The library is, with the exception of those of the univer-
sities, one of the few purely scientific libraries in the United States.
With its great wealth and its wisely restricted policy it wee doubtless

in time advance to a high rank and by the liberal principles of its
administration become of great use. We may well be anxious to know
how its librarian, Mr. C. W. Andrews, will solve the great problem of
a new building after the many notable attempts in this line that have
been made in the United States.

14. NEWBERRY LIBRARY.

This library, like the John Crerar Library, owes its existence to the
generosity of a rich citizen of Chicago, Walter Loomis Newberry,“
who died in 1868. Ina will made in 1866? he left half of his prop-
erty after the death of the direct heirs for a ‘‘free public library”
in the northern part of the city, and directed his two trustees to use a
portion of the bequest for buildings, but to invest the remainder as
they might think proper ‘‘for the growth, preservation, permanence,
and general usefulness of such library.” After the direct heirs died
in 1885, the property in question amounted to over $2,000,000,° and
in 1887 there was $67,778 income available, so that steps could be
taken toward its foundation. The two trustees took counsel with
some other gentlemen, and it was decided to establish a reference
library whose books should not be lent out—like the John Crerar
Library, which has adopted that plan—as distinguished from a circu-
lating library from which the books may be taken out. In the same
year the erection of a temporary building on the site of the testator’s
residence in the northern part of the city was taken in hand, some
rooms were rented for immediate use, and there was appointed a
librarian, W. F. Poole, who for fourteen years had occupied a similar
position in the public library of Chicago and was one of the leading
librarians of America (among other things he founded in 1853 the
Index to Periodical Literature which is still continued), and two other
employees. Forty thousand dollars was appropriated for books and
pamphlets. In the spring of 1888 some 14,000 volumes were installed
in the provisional building, and the library was opened to the public.

At the beginning of 1890 a removal was made to another provisional
building not far from the first one and near the site on which it was
intended to build the final structure. This was a one-storied, fireproof

aW. L. Newberry, born in 1804; his ancestors came from England to America in
1630. He lived subsequent to 1833 as a banker in Chicago, possessed a fine library,
belonged among others to the Chicago Board of Education, and was president of the
Historical Society. From 1857, because of his heaith, he spent every winter in
southern France. Not only is he renowned for his own magnificent benefaction
which keeps his memory permanently green, but his example induced the founda-
tion of the John Crerar Library in another part of the city (see p. 451).

poration Act, p. 18 (27 pp.).

invested in houses and lots it is continually rising in value.

house, built for the purpose, 175 feet long by 65 feet wide, capable of
holding 200,000 volumes. The transfer of over 90,000 books, pam-
phlets, ete., was completed in a week. The building contained an
auditorium in which up to the year 1892 42 lectures had been given
to audiences varying from 220 to 550 persons, under the auspices of
an association that had been formed with the name the Newberry
Library Center for University Extension. In the same year the
library, then managed by a single surviving trustee, was incorporated
by the State under the name of the Newberry Library, and the
trustee mentioned nominated a board of 13 trustees that had the power
to elect its own president. Eleven of these first trustees or directors
still retain their office. They are all men of wealth and prominence in
the city, all are at the head of great affairs, some of them of interna-
tional reputation. At the end of 1893 the new library building was
ready, the transfer of over 150,000 books, pamphlets, ete., being com-
pleted in ten days.

The general plan for the building was already settled upon in 1888,
as follows: It was to provide sufficient room to meet the demands of
at least twenty-five years and to be so constructed that additions to the
original plan could be built from time to time; it must avoid ** the con-
fessed errors of the conventional style, it must have the equipment of
what is in the highest sense an educational institution—an audience
room, reading rooms, study rooms, and every arrangement that would
make the resources of the library available to those seeking its treas-
ures. It must have also the conveniences for administration, for
study, and for the storage of books, which the concurrent experience
of modern times demands.” This fine problem, conceived according
to the ideas of W. F. Poole, was in 1888 confided to the architect,
Henry Ives Cobb. In 1889 the site was selected, about one and a half
acres, Ina small park, midway between Lake and Lincoln parks, not
far from the shore of the lake, in a region comparatively free from
smoke and near a great artery of travel with an electric railway. The
building, begun in 1890, required an expenditure of over $500,000,
which was defrayed from the accumulated interest and a part of the
capital. The great structure is three-storied,“ built of pink Milford,
Connecticut, granite and presents an imposing as well as a tasteful
appearance, especially in summer, under the high old trees of Walton
Place. The present structure, however, is only a third of the contem-
plated one, which is to form a great quadrangle with a court in the
center. Internal convenience to a certain extent has been sacrificed
to architectural beauty. The basement is 10 feet high, the first floor
20 feet, the second and third floors 26 feet each, and the fourth floor

a#\n America it is called five-storied, as the basement and ground floor are each

15 feet. These heights so greatly exceed the heights of the book
stacks, which are 7 feet 6 inches high, and which can be used without
ladders, that a large free space remains above them, and the books are
also lighted laterally from above. This has been done to give them
“light and breathing space,” but I am not aware that books suffer
even in closed cases, and it contradicts the principles of modern library
arrangement, according to which the books should be compressed into
as narrow a space as possible, which, owing to the rapid increase of
books in our prolific times, is the only possible method of preventing
a too wide extension of the building. For this reason stacks are piled
directly on stacks with hardly any free space between. Sufficient air

for ‘ breathing” is afforded by good ventilation, and the electric light
to-day affords means of temporary illumination of the darkest corners,
while the daylight, bleaching everything that it falls upon, can not be
considered in any case as the most desirable. The book stacks are 10
inches deep. * .

In March, 1901, there were in the library 229,364 books, pamphlets
(71,859), maps, manuscripts, etchings, and autographs (of which 56
per cent were in languages other than English), an average for the
fourteen years of 16,000 numbers a year, so that at the end of 1901
there will be almost one-quarter of a million. The present building
has room for 900,000; with the prospective later building there would
462 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

be room for 3,000,000, which, at the present rate of increase, would
suffice for two hundred years, but with the modern arrangement of the
book stacks, like those in the Congressional Library at Washington,
for example, the building would certainly hold double that number, if
not many more: The Newberry Library has therefore a chance for
unchecked development in this direction.

The floor plans shown in figs. 48-52 give, with the legends, an idea
of the arrangement of the rooms. Perhaps it would have been more
judicious to have avoided the running of a corridor along the inner
wall of the building, as it cuts off the light to the book rooms from
this side and, besides, makes the access more difficult, but the halls,
with their absolutely plain light decoration in greenish walls and white
ceilings, and the antehalls, decorated with paintings and busts, make
an excellent, charming, and pleasing impression, and they should
undoubtedly be considered as very successful. The first story has a
marble floor while the others are floored with reddish brown, unglazed,

now ventilated by opening the windows, which have been altered for
the purpose. The apparatus is either not rightly set up or not
properly run, for similar ones are working satisfactorily in the Con-
gressional Library at Washington and elsewhere. I shall speak more
fully of this important subject when I treat of the public library (see
p. 473). While the books could, with the ventilation that was designed,
be kept free from dust or nearly so, now they are soiled without hin-
drance or require a greater expenditure for cleaning, and although the

situation of the Newberry Library is not so unfavorable for soot and
dust as that of the Crerar and public libraries, these bad conditions
are notably present.

The building itself was constructed throughout in a fireproof man-
ner, with nothing combustible except the window frames and doors.
Clumsy wooden book stacks have, however, been installed, although
almost everywhere these have in recent times given place to iron ones,
464 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

which are more elegant and in every respect to be preferred, as I
have mentioned on previous pages and shall mention again. Wooden
cases were chosen ‘* because iron rusts in the damp climate of Chicago,
because it is cold to the hand and is ugly.” That iron easily rusts in
Chicago is shown by the fact that in midsummer a pair of steel scissors,
if not cleaned daily, soon becomes covered with a coating of rust,
exactly as in the moist heat of the Tropics, but if the iron is suitably
covered with a coat of varnish it does not rust, as is clearly shown by
the examples of iron work in John Crerar Library and the public
library in Chicago. The other objections made to the use of iron are,
if possible, still less tenable. The other furniture is also madeof wood,
and not of iron, as in the building of the historical society.

A very remarkable peculiarity of the installation of the Newberry
Library, is that each principal science is assigned a room by itself, with
facilities for reading, so that any one who wishes to read on a subject
‘an go at once to the division relating to it, get his book very quickly
and proceed to work. This is certainly, in many cases, a great advan-

tage, but often the division in which the book is to be sought is not
known, and related subjects may sometimes be so distributed in vari-
ous divisions that complications can not be avoided. For earnest
students, well acquainted with the library, the arrangement is certainly
of the very greatest use. Under this arrangement, besides the prin-
cipal reading room with 100 places, in the second story, there are two
reading rooms (medicine), with 32 places, each in the first story, 3 in
second story (philosophy, history, art, and literature), with a total of
104 places, and two in the third story (genealogy and music, natural

sciences), each with 40 places, making a grand total of 316 places.

As already briefly mentioned, under the John Crerar Library, the
Newberry Library principally confines itself to certain classes of sub-
jects, and therefore sold to the former institution, in 1896, a part of
its scientific stock, namely, 6,331 volumes and 1,483 pamphlets, for
$16,000. The Newberry Library has the following 6 divisions: Medi-
cine, bibliography, history, philosophy, artand literature, science, and it
is strongest on the subjects of medicine, bibliography, American local
history, genealogy, music, and in periodicals and papers of societies.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 465

On the first floor is the division of medicine (20, 21), with a special
room named after Dr. N. Senn, professor of surgery in Rush Medical
College in Chicago, who, three days after the library moved into its new
building, promised a great part of his medical books, on the ground
that it was a fireproof structure, and who also did much afterwards for
the Newberry Library. He has also bought and presented the library
of E. du Bois-Reymond, comprising 10,200 volumes and pamphlets, “
and that of Surg. W. B. Baum, of Gottingen. The Senn collection
by itself embraces 23,400 numbers. The division of medicine com-
prised in May, 1901, 33,972 books and 27,583 pamphlets, among which
were 459 periodicals. It will therefore compare with the largest
medical libraries in New York and Philadelphia. The medical library
of the United States Army Medical Museum in Washington has
352,000 books and pamphlets and contains 1,500 medical journals.
The nucleus of the medical portion of the Newberry Library was
formed by a stock of 17,000 volumes and pamphlets, which had been
deposited by 4 medical societies of Chicago in the public library, and
were transferred from thence in 1890. There is besides this, in the
first story, bibliography (89), which is represented best; office rooms
(31, 34, 38), and a museum (24). This museum held in May, 1901, 153
manuscripts,’ 315 incunabula, 212 volumes, specimens of artistic book
bindings, 53 various other book bindings, 96 illustrated manuscripts
from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries, 113 Aldines, 97 Elzevirs,
27 Estiennes, Giuntas, etc., 150 Americana in first and rare editions,
autograph copies and éditions de luxe,“ and 215 various volumes for

from Maioli (1549) and the Groliers (1550-1565) to the Frenchmen
Bouzonnet-Trautz and the Englishman Bedford, and others (nineteenth
century). From the sixteenth century there are 25 examples, from the

¢ American history has been espevially kept in view in the Newberry Library from
the beginning, and in 1895 it came into the possession of a collection of 5,000 volumes
relating to the earliest times, which had been collected by one of the trustees, E. E.
Ayer. At present a thorough descriptive catalogue is being prepared of the entire
7,000 works of rare Americana, which contain a great deal on the North American
Indians, and also rare, early maps of the American Continent. On this catalogue
there are working, at the expense of Mr. Ayer, about 10 specialists of rank in the
United States, the library. itself, however, assuming the conduct of the matter and
the bibliographical arrangement of the entire material. It has also drawn up a com-
prehensive scheme for the coworkers, by which they proceed according to common
points of view. This very comprehensive critical catalogue promises to be a work
of eminent bibliographic significance. It is fortunate in obtaining the special support
of the gentlemen mentioned.

seventeenth 14, from the eighteenth 22, and from the nineteenth 109
English, 187 French, and 40 various. All are chronologically arranged,
so that they can be studied according to periods, countries, and individ-
uals. The walls of the museum are, like the antehalls, decorated ae
pictures and busts. As early as 1888, the American painter, G. P. /
Healy, living in Paris, preseaten a erecnan of nearly 50 oil ae
painted by himself since 1841, among which are portraits of Lincoln,
Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, the founder Newberry, and the painter
himself; of busts there are, in the same place, Dante, Shakespeare,
Newberry, and Henry Clay. In the antehalls there are busts of
Blaine, Thiers, Guizot, Lesseps, Liszt, Stanley, and others, as well as
reliefs of Demosthenes, Shakespeare, Wagner, Hiindel, and Men-
delssohn, and also three high reliefs by J. Gelert, each 13 feet long
by 5 feet wide, representing La Salle’s expedition through Illinois,
1680, Fort Deamon tn in 1812, and a scriptorium—Benedictine monks
working on manuscripts, 1456. All these constitute the beginning of
an art collection whose special advancement will be deferred to a
future time.

In the second story is a large reading room (48) with LOO seats,
where there are immediately accessible to the- public 340 volumes -of
general reference works, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc.; 801 volumes
of current periodicals and papers of societies, 94 Rudolph indexer
books, with shelf catalogues for philosophy, sociology, and religion,
which subjects are to be found in the neighboring hall, No. 44; 133
Rudolph indexer books, with author catalogues for general works, and
finally, a map case, with 10 maps on rollers. Nearby (49) are periodi-
cals. In 1900 there were 1,260 periodicals taken, among which, as
already mentioned, were 459 on medical subjects, the others being
distributed, by nationalities, as follows: 569 American, 246 German,”
215 English, 126 French, 37 Italian, 12 Belgian, 11 Swedish, 8 Cana-
dian, 7 Swiss, 6 Dutch, 5 Spanish, 3 each of Norwegian, Danish, Rus-
sian, Japanese, 2 each of Chinese and Bohemian, and 1 each of Moxics an
and North American Indian. Further, history (42), with subsection
of history, biography and genealogy, geography and travels, antiqul-
ties, and manners and customs; also philosophy (44), with the subsections
philosophy and religion, sociology,’ and instruction. I will mention a
collection of 88 rare old Bibles from 1476 on, as well as an example
of the 16mo. *‘ Caxton” Bible of 1,052 pages, which on June 30, 1877,
was printed within twelve hours at Oxford, in an edition of only 100
copies: as well as finely bound in London.“ There is Bis a ehse and

a Not salle is German well represented in the periodic ie it also eae prominent

case, as well asin some others, an exception has been made.

rare collection of American and English hymn books. Finally, art
and humanistic sciences (50, 51), with subsections of art, literature,
and languages.” I will mention 324 lexicons in ‘almost all languages.”

In the third story is the department of science (71), with subsections
of natural science, Congressional documents, bound newspaper files,
and special collections. The union of such a mixture under a depart-
ment of science is not exactly happy. I will mention as specialties
1,200 volumes on China, 1,882 numbers on fishes, fish culture and
angling, Egyptian and sporting collections. There is also found in
the third story genealogy, and the musical library (57), with scores of
the great composers, works on the history and theory of music, as
well as on instruments, together with critical papers, journals, biog-
raphies; also lexicons and cyclopedias in ‘‘all” languages, and finally,
works on the early Greek music and the early Italian writers. The
principal item of interest is the musical collection of Count Pio Resse
in Florence, which was bought in 1888. Recently the well-known
American musician, Theodore Thomas, gave to this institution his
great musical library. Finally, there are in the third story three lec-
ture rooms (63-65) that hold 100 persons each, and a hall (56) which is
temporarily assigned to the Friday Club, the most exclusive literary
and social woman’s club in Chicago.

In the fourth story is the well-appointed bookbindery (78)—every-
thing is bound in the building. The rest of the rooms, except one for
duplicates (73), are vacant.

On either side of the principal stairway there is a passenger eleva-
tor from the basement to the fourth story, besides a book elevator at
another place, as shown in the plans, figs. 48-52.

The installation and marking of the books is done according to Cut-
ter’s seventh system? with some modifications. Every section has the
Cutter letters and numbers and to this is added an author’s number
according toa special list of the Newberry Library. The books stand
in the order of their numbers, as in the Dewey decimal system.

The method of cataloguing of this library is quite peculiar and
extremely ingenious, and is according to the system invented by the
assistant librarian, A. J. Rudolph, a Hungarian, who from 1879 to
1894 was assistant librarian in the San Francisco Free Public Library.

@In June, 1901, the Newberry Library purchased the well-known Library of Prince
Louis Lucien Bonaparte, who died in 1891. It contained 15,000 volumes on
European languages. Negotiations for this lasted two years. It is a most important
acquisition.

door opened. The titles of the books are placed upon strips of card-
board 4 inches long and 1 to 6 inches or more in width, as may be
necessary; these are shoved into a thin tin plate or frame grooved at
the sides, 15 inches long and 44 inches wide, so that each such plate
may contain 30 to 50 titles. In order to lighten the plates they are
perforated with 18 holes of one-eighth inch diameter in two rows.
The plates are hung with their long edges together like an endless chain,
which runs over two drums and can be turned either to the right or
to the left. As the strips of cardboard are easily moved new titles
may be put in as needed. A case holds 1,000 frames with 30,000 to
50,000 titles which can be passed in review, either quickly or slowly
at will. A Rudolph continuous indexer, with 500 frames for 15,000 to
25,000 titles, costs $150 and can be
furnished by Thomas Kane & Co., 137
Wabash avenue, Chicago. A quite
similar arrangement is the Rudolph
indexer book, fig. 54. This is 123
inches long and 8 inches wide and con-
tains 10 stiff leaves for from 600 to 800
titles. It costs at the house just men-
tioned $5.75, and is also prepared in
other lengths and thicknesses. Leaves
may be shoved in and out at will, or
a volume that has become too thick
may be divided into two. These two
methods are extensively used in the
Newberry Library—1,075 Rudolph in-
dexer books, 463 being for the genea-
logical catalogue, and 612 for the shelf
and principal catalogue.

A further specialty of this library
is the ‘‘Rudolph pamphlet binder,”
bound on the same principle as the Rudolph indexer book shown in fig.
54, a practical and very tasteful although somewhat expensive way of
binding a series of pamphlets together. A cheaper and good way of
binding single pamphlets is afforded by the *‘ Newberry binder,” a
simple cover of enameled cardboard with a linen back, rather neatly
made up.

The cards for the indexer are manifolded upon the typewriter, but
if many are required, they are now multiplied by means of Réntgen
rays, according to a method invented by Mr. Rudolph but not yet
published.” The titles are written, one after the other, upon sheets

«Mr. Rudolph in this way manifolds both print and illustrations by means of the
Rontgen rays. He also uses a device, as simple as it is effective, for splitting apart
leaves that are printed or illustrated on both sides, in case it is desired to use both

by the typewriter, pasted upon cardboard, and then cut apart to slip

into the indexer.
All that can be done by the bookbinder, like the mounting of cards,

the preparation of the Rudolph indexer books and the covers for the
pamphlets, the pasting and cutting of strips for the indexer, repairs,
etc., is done in the bindery of the library. All books are stitched
with from four to seven threads which are often of silk, the backs are
covered with binder’s gauze and provided with linen guards stitched
on. All plates are attached to muslin guards, much-used volumes
have parchment corners, and all are gilded on the upper edge. All
parts of yet incomplete volumes of journals, and works issued in parts,
are temporarily bound in Rudolph binders. The cover of one of these
binders costs the library 30 cents, and the appliances for holding each
pamphlet, 10 cents, so the cost of a volume of five pamphlets would be
80 cents, certainly a relatively heavy expense, but such a volume is
extremely solid and very elegant. If a pamphlet is to be bound by
itself, the simple Newberry binder is used, which costs the library
44 cents. The production of the Rudolph indexer books costs the
library, for the size 124 by 10 inches, with 10 stiff leaves, or 19 by 10
inches with 15 flexible leaves, $2.20 each.

sides of the same leaf. A further very remarkable manifolding process in blue-
print is used by Mr. Rudolph for the formation of catalogues. For instance, the
Newberry Library in 1899 prepared 10 copies of a folio volume of 500 pages, which
bears the title: ‘‘British Museum. Catalogue of Printed Books. Accessions, Janu-
uary, 1880, to March, 1899. Academies, with an Index.’’ It is an alphabetically
arranged register, comprising some 5,000 titles (with an index of about 3,000 entries)
of accessions concerning ‘‘Academies’’ acquired by the British Museum from 1880
to 1899; these titles were contained in 446 single publications of the British Museum,
so that it was difficult to find anything in them. They were cut apart, arranged in
alphabetical order, and manifolded by blueprinting, which is very quickly done and
very cheap. A page of 25 titles costs 4 cents exclusive of labor, a volume of 500
pages therefore costs $20.a copy. It was contemplated to combine in 40 such vol-
umes, alphabetically arranged, the 900,000 titles of new accessions to the British
Museum from 1880 to 1899, but this was stopped after the first volume, because the
British Museum had, in the meantime, the prospect of a more speedy publication of
its supplementary catalogue of printed books. The method employed by the New-
berry Library is, however, so remarkable and promising that I did not wish to leave
it unmentioned. Mr. Rudolph had the great kindness to present me with a copy of the
10 that had been produced, as well as to provide me with examples of the various
stages of the work, which I will be glad to show to any who are interested. On the
method itself he has published an article in the Library Journal, XXIV, 1899, pp.
102-105, ‘‘The Blueprint Process for Printing Catalogues.’’ I will further say that the
leaves of the catalogue I have mentioned have blueprinting on both sides, but which
is only apparently effected by pasting together, back to back, two very thin leaves
printed only onone side. Blueprinting can only bedone on oneside, and the originals,
too, must not bear print upon the back. Since this is the case with 200 of the first
leaves of the British Museum Catalogue just referred to, which later has been pub-
lished, printed on only one side, it has been necessary, before their reproduction by
blueprint, to split them apart, which for this purpose has also been accomplished.
Mr. Rudolph’s ingenuity has been successful in overcoming all difficulties.
A470 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The following catalogues are kept:

1. Two copies of an author's catalogue (exclusive of medicine), one
of which is upon cards for use of employees, and the other in 133 Ru-
dolph indexer books for the public in the large reading room (48) of
the second story.

2. A general dictionary catalogue (exclusive of medicine) in Rudolph
continuous indexers and in Rudolph indexer books for the public
in the large reading room. In this, therefore, are found authors,
titles, subjects, and references arranged ina single alphabetical series.
This catalogue contains 450,000 to 500,000 entries and when complete
will fill 10 Rudolph continuous indexers and 500 Rudolph indexer
books. For practical well-considered reasons, which I have no space
to enter into here, all of the strips which have 10 or more typewritten
lines are arranged in the books, and all shorter ones in the indexer.

6. A genealogical index of American families, with over 500,000
entries, which contain far more than a million references, in 463
Rudolph indexer books. This very comprehensive catalogue owes its
origin to the circumstance that everywhere in the United States peo-
ple are very much given to genealogical researches, everyone seeming
eager to show that his ancestors belong to the early colonists, whose
footsteps leading from the ancestral home are traced out with the
greatest zeal; therefore all sorts of family and local histories have
been purchased which could be procured in America, and the index in
question is almost an index for the existing American, and for many
English, family records. It includes over 200,000 families with their
branches from the year 1565 on to the present time. The catalogue
was begun in 1897. Four persons work on it uninterruptedly, and it
is to be printed. There are, to be sure, printed indices of the kind,
such as those of Whitmore and Durrie (1895), but the former contains
only 12 notices under Smith, the latter only 196, while the Newberry
index contains 976. A more detailed description of this undertaking
is found in the Library Journal, XXIV, 1899, pages 53 to 55.

These show relatively large variations, together with a general
decreasing number of readers and a corresponding decrease. in use,
but the figures are nearly constant in the last three years. Compared
with the John Crerar Library the relatively large attendance of women
is striking, a difference which may be owing to the departments kept
up by the Newberry Library—art, literature, music—for ‘‘ popular”
books are hardly kept. During my visit I saw a couple of quite young
girls, still children, working there, and when I asked what they were
doing, was told they were probably reading up for a school task that
had been set them for home work. I mention this because it is so
entirely contrary to our German practice, for if such tendencies should
occur at all we would, though mistakenly, certainly curb them.

No lunches may be eaten in the library rooms, but at a definite time

472° REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

In the three lecture halls of the third story lectures are given by
professors of the University of Chicago (see also, p. 460).

The number of emplovees is 53, as follows: 1 librarian, 1 assistant
librarian, 21 assistants and cataloguers, 7 pages, 3 clerks, 9 book-
binders, 6 attendants, 1 engineer, 2 checkers, 2 watchmen. As far as
one can judge from the annual reports, which are brief and indefinite,
the library had spent up to the close of 1899, $391,843 for books, peri-
odicals, and fittings; about $340,000 for purposes of administration—
that is, for fourteen years about an annual average of $28,000 for
books, ete., and $24,000 for administration, there being an annual
average increase of about 17,000 numbers, about one-third of which,
however, were gifts; these in 1900 were 3,675 numbers. In 1900 the
income from the Newberry bequest—and no other income is availa-
ble “—amounted approximately to $108,000, of which about $31,000
was used for salaries, about $10,000 for books, about $1,200 for
heating and lighting, about $4,800 for bookbinding, including that of
the catalogues, about $35,000 for repairs, etc., to the houses owned
by the library, for insurance, postage, freight, printing, ete. The
remainder of over $25,000 is probably held in reserve, as there is no
information concerning it.

The first librarian, Doctor Poole, died in 1894, and in his place was
appointed J. V. Cheney, who since 1887 had been head librarian of the
San Francisco Public Library, from which he brought to Chicago
A. J. Rudolph, his right-hand man, and here introduced with him the
Rudolph methods of cataloguing.?

The library has thus far published nothing except short annual
reports.

Only quite exceptionally are books allowed to be taken from the
building. They are then sent to a library that is nearer to the scholars
who may require them, such as the University of Chicago, the Field
Columbian Museum, the Northwestern University at Evanston, ete.
The question as to whether a reference or a circulating library is the
most useful form is well worthy of investigation; there must certainly

“The city levies no taxes on the library itself, though it does on the buildings,
from which the institution derives a great portion of its income, and this tax amounts
to over $25,000 annually. This seems astonishing when the public utility of the
Newberry Library is taken into account, but, as with us, in the matter of taxes all
generous feelings are abandoned. For example, the Royal Dresden museums, which
are exclusively kept up by the State, must pay taxes on articles imported from for-
eign countries, only objects for the collections themselves being free; neither do they
enjoy free postage, as is the case with all university institutes and many similar
museums in other German States.

and original catalogue: San Francisco Free Public Library. Classified English Prose
Fiction, including Translation and Juvenile Works, with Notes and Index to Subject-
references. No. 6, 1891. vili}-306 pp. Lex. 8vo. Mr. Rudolph conceived in San

be many local conditions which bear upon the matter. In our small
German university cities, for example, where learned men use the
books for exhaustive study, and the same books are rarely wanted by
different persons at the same time, and where besides there is hardly
any outside public that uses the library, a reference library is certainly
not to be preferred to the lending library system now in use. But in
cities where a great, general public has need for books, it appears to
me that the lending principle adopted by us is less called for, but cer-
tainly in this case such means ought to be adopted as obtained in the
American reference libraries. The libraries must be opened to every
one from morning until evening without onerous conditions, and
sufficient opportunity must be afforded for undisturbed reading. The
catalogue must be, as there, made practical and accessible, the books
must be placed according to an easily intelligible system, access must
be had to the bookshelves; above all there must be employees who are
exclusively at the service of the public and make it their principal
business to attend to readers—arrangements, in short, which, with some
exceptions, we are not at all acquainted with in Germany and do not
even anticipate.

The Newberry and the John Crerar libraries are a noble pair, twin
children of civic patriotism. In spite of their being a mile and
quarter distant from each other they may be considered as a unit, since
their field of work is more or less limited with regard to each other.
Chicago has in them, a beautiful, excellently arranged, most freely
accessible, scientific, public reference library, in two separate build-
ings, already comprising 325,000 numbers,” and the total collection of
the two libraries will, within twenty-five years, at the present rate of
increase of 27,000 numbers a year, amount to 1,000,000. The Berlin
library hasa eetind million, the Paris library 3,000,000, and the London
4,000,000 to 5,000,000 numbers. Chicago, however, loves to make
unexpected leaps in its development, and who knows how quickly
fortune may confound such a calculation. The noble contest between
the Newberry Library and the John Crerar Library will certainly
produce the most elaborate results.

15. CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY.

The idea of a public library, conceived by Benjamin Franklin in
1732, has received a most magnificent development in the United
States, while in Germany the slight beginnings that have been made
are hardly worth mentioning. ‘‘America has taken the lead in develop-
ing the usefulness of public libraries,” said Thomas Greenwood in 1894,
on page 524 of the fourth edition of his monograph entitled Public

«The Public inaee of Chicago, PiGcn is quite near the John Crerar L nee has
322,000 numbers; the three libraries together, therefore, have nearly 650,000,

Libraries: A History of the Movement and a Manual for the Organiza-
tion and Management of Rate-supported Libraries (598 pp., London),
But since then the rise of the public libraries in the United States has
been even more extraordinary, and as a crowning achievement of the
entire movement the public libraries of Boston and Chicago bear wit-
ness, and this will soon be further exemplified in New York,-as men-
tioned in Part I of this paper.

In 1899 there were in the United States 7,184 public libraries, with
35,000,000 books.“ Each village, as one may say, possesses one,’ and
their influence upon general culture is perhaps as great as that of the
schools. These public libraries are maintained, some of them by the
community, some by private persons, and some by both. Andrew |
Carnegie alone has, since 1886, founded 66 libraries, costing $8,500,000,
and quite recently he has founded 65 more in New York City, at a cost
of $5,200,000. The Boston Public Library, with 15 branch reading
rooms and 14 delivery stations, costs the city yearly $288,641, or over
50 cents each for a population of 561,000. The Chicago Public Library,
with 6 branch reading rooms and 65 delivery stations, besides stations
in the public schools,” costs the city $263,397— that is 154 cents annu-
ally each for a population of 1,700,000. Massachusetts has most com-
pletely developed the public-library system, and it is a mark of honor
on the escutcheon of the State. However, the Chicago Public Library
stands foremost in the world in lending each year, without charge,

Antrim, The latest Stage of Library Development, in the Forum, XX XI, p. 337,
1901, there are now 8,000 libraries, with 50,000,000 books; according to the United
States Bureau of Education, No. 232 (Public, Society, and School Libraries), 1897, pp.
340 and 367, there were, in 1896, 4,026 public, society, and school libraries of 1,000 vol-
umes and over, with 33,000,000 books and 5,500,000 pamphlets, of which there were
2 having over 500,000, 4 having over 300,000, 28 having over 100,000, 69 having over
50,000, 155 having over 25,000, 411 with over 10,000, 680 with over 5,000, 2,727 with
over 1,000, and 3,167 with over 300. The number of German books in American
libraries has been discussed recently by L. Triang in an interesting article in the
Berliner Tageblatt of May 7, 1901 (Parlament’s edition).

> Recently traveling libraries have been established for farmers living in isolated
situations (see p. 400 of this paper). These go from village to village (see Antrim,
Forum, XX XI, p. 338). In the New York parks books are lent free.

¢ Besides this he has founded 18 in Great Britain, at a cost of $720,000 (University
of the State of New York, Home Education Bulletin, No. 31, May, 1900, p. 69).
Further, he gave $1,660,000 for other scientific endowments (Report Commissioner

He writes, incidentally, concerning his gift—one can not call it a princely gift, for
princes have not sufficient money to do it—to the director of the Public Library in
New York, Dr. J. 8. Billings: ‘‘I should esteem it a rare privilege to be permitted
to furnish the money as needed for the buildings, say, $5,200,000’’ (Bulletin, New

As the great fire in October, 1871, practically destroyed all libraries,
both public and private, Chicago suffered from a real book famine,
and the English writer, Thomas Hughes, addressed an appeal to the
writers and publishers among his countrymen to provide the city

with books, and there quickly came in this way, from Great Britain
and the rest of Europe, and from America, a total of 7,000 volumes, the
nucleus of the public library which was founded in January, 1872. In
January, 1873, a reading room was opened temporarily in the city hall,
and in March, 1874, the library, with over 17,000 volumes, was estab-
lished not far from its present location. From 1875 on it was again

volumes, it moved into the fourth story of the new City Hall, whence, in
1897, with about 230,000 books, it was transferred in six and one-half

public. In 1893 the corner stone of the edifice was laid, not far from
the former Fort Dearborn, whose garrison was butchered by the
Indians in 1812, and which was the first permanent settlement in the
swamp upon which Chicago later arose. The building comprises ¢
quadrangle between Washington and Randolph streets and Michigan
avenue, its long east front facing a park along the lake. The site is
immediately adjacent to the principal business center of the city, and
occupies about 14 acres of ground, the building itself being 330 feet
long, 146 feet wide, and 100 feet high above the pavement (exclusive of
the balustrade). It is well orientated as to the sun, in that the free,
long side faces toward the east: but opposite the remaining sides are
high houses. The funds for the building were raised from 1891 to
1896 by six annual tax levies, amounting to $2,000,000, which was
borne most willingly by the people of Chicago, an example of the
public spirit of that city often unjustly charged with worldliness.@

The disposition of the interior was more or less determined by the
rights of the adjoining property holders, who stipulated that the
entrance should be on the narrow side, but especially by the fact that
the building must include a large memorial hall with many accessory
rooms for the Grand Army of the Republic, the memorial hall in per-
petuity, the accessory rooms to be devoted to this use for some 50
years.

The hands of the architects were somewhat tied by these and several
other restrictions. The location within the city, where sulphurous
gases arise from soft coal used, forbade frescoes and other usual kinds
of decoration. As it was not wished to renounce rich external orna-

“Frederick Harrison, one of the most eminent English historians and writers, says,
in the report of his recent visit to the United States (Nineteenth Century, June,
1901): ‘*Chicago struck me as being somewhat unfairly condemned as devoted to
nothing but Mammon and pork. Certainly during my visit I heard of nothing but
the progress of education, university endowments, people’s institutes, libraries,
museums, art schools, workmen’s model dwellings and farms, literary culture, and
scientific foundations.’’

ment, but on the contrary to use this for the pleasure and refinement
of the people, therefore marble and mosaic work were chosen, in the
hope that it might wear as well as that which Justinian in the fifth
century employed in the church of St. Sophia at Constantinople. As
prime necessities it was stipulated that there must be security from
fire and plenty of light. The books must also be placed centrally in
order to be easily accessible, and it was further prescribed, among
other things, that there should be convenient public access to the
rooms, spacious book delivery and reading rooms, and such furnishing
and arrangement of all the rooms that they could easily be kept clean.

C. A. Coolidge, of the firm of architects Shepley, Rutan & Cool-
idge, of Boston and Chicago, who also built the Art Institute, solved
this great problem in a most satisfactory manner. In modern Europe
I would not know where to find anything similar in this line; the new
German library buildings certainly can not compare with it. The
original estimates were not exceeded, the total cost of the building
being, in round numbers, $2,125,000, including architects and builders’
fees of about $112,000. It is a Renaissance structure, with Greek and
Roman motives, the exterior of limestone with a base of granite, the
stairway, on the southern side, like the entrance to an imperial Roman
palace, or, by electric light, it appears as a fairy castle of the Arabian
nights, built of white Carrara marble with mosaics of colored glass,
mother-of-pearl, and shell. The halls, saloons, and rooms are lined
with marble. Ten different kinds of American and European marble
were used. The walls and ceilings in some cases are overdecorated
and florid; simplicity would here have been preferable in my opinion.
The plain structure cost about $600,000, the interior decoration about
$500,000, independently of the decoration of the memorial Grand
Army hall, which cost $75,000. I am quite unable, within the limits
of this report, to give a description of the lavish magnificence here
displayed, and must also restrict myself as to my illustrations, which
would otherwise give the reader a better idea of it. 1 must content
myself with saying that as a whole, whatever might be said of single
portions, the structure is an imposing artistic creation, to which justice
can not be done in a few words.¢

The floor plans, figs. 55 to 57, show the arrangement of the
rooms. The principal entrance, from Washington street, lies toward
the south; the principal front, Michigan avenue, toward the east.
The book stacks extend partly through three stories, there being six

plement, January, 1898; the Quarterly Book Review, December, 1897; Public Libraries,

tenths of all the work was done in Chicago itself, certainly a testimony to the splendid
ability of the industrial arts there. I have used especially the publication first cited,
which is richly illustrated.

decks, one above the other. They are immediately back of the deliv-
ery room on the second story (Plate 30).

This room, 144 feet long and 53 feet wide, runs across the entire
building and opens immediately upon the principal stairway, consti-
tuting with that stairway the most splendid feature of the building.
It is decorated in the richest manner with marble and glass mosaics,
especially in the high central cupola, which is 38 feet in diameter at
its base and 11 feet high (36 feet above the floor). Perhaps nothing
similar to it has been produced since the fourteenth century. At the
northern end of the second story are the rooms for the veterans
(memorial hall, assembly hall, etc.). There is here inserted a mezza-
nine story. Over this, in the third story, is the great reading room for
current periodicals and newspapers (Plate 31), which, like the deliv-
ery room, runs across the entire building, together with the reference
room. The reading room has 415 seats and about 100 standing places
at the newspaper racks, and the reference room, including the adjoin-
ing rooms, has 225 seats;“ the former is 36 feet high, 144 feet long,
and 60 feet wide; the latter is 33 feet high, 144 feet long, and 42 feet
wide. The collective area covered by all the rooms of the library,
throughout all the stories, amounts to twoanda half acres. At various
places, as has been already mentioned for the north end of the second
story, mezzanine stories are inserted, which has been ingeniously done
without injury to the facade (Plate 28) by placing the floor of the
mezzanine behind the crossbar of a window and covering it, at the
same time painting it dark below, so that from without it is almost
invisible. The arrangement and designation of the remaining rooms
are shown on the ground plans. ‘The rear court, on the western side,
which is open as an entrance for carriages to Garland place, is later to
be built over, so that in the place of the now open right angle which
appears in the plans of the second and third stories, there will be built
three stack rooms which will directly adjoin similar rooms in the first
story behind the delivery room.

The vast machinery plant is placed in the basement. The public
library is entirely independent, in that it supplies its own electric
power, heat, and light (26 are and over 7,000 incandescent lamps), and
it also has its own water reservoir, rendering it independent of the
city supply, 1f necessary, and sufficing for its normal wants for thirty
hours. The arrangements of this underground world of machinery
are admirable. Even in these regions there rules a high degree of
elegance and magnificence. It is a fault, however, that the powerful
engines stand in the building itself, and therefore shake it. In the
evening, when they are working with their full power, there is at
certain places a strong tremor not only disagreeable to feel, but very

injurious to the building itself, as, for example, to the mosaic floors,
which already have suffered at various places. If the engines must
stand in the house itself, they should be isolated, as in Columbia Uni-
versity, already mentioned, although this would be more difficult in
the swampy ground of Chicago than in the rocky region of Columbia
University. Eight electric elevators serve for the incessant demands
of visitors. The stairs are but little used.

The problem of a fireproof building has here been perfectly solved.
In Chicago, as well as elsewhere in America, it is customary, when
constructing large buildings, to first of all erect a steel framework or
skeleton, which runs from top to bottom and across the building (see
fig. 58), and into this frame are set the walls of brick or stone (as with
us a framework of wood is filled out with stones and clay) and the
building can then be carried on from above downward, instead of the
opposite, since each story is independent from the others and rests on
its own foundation. In the public library this has been avoided, for
if in such buildings stores of combustible goods begin to burn, the
steel beams bend and the whole structure falls together. like a house
of cards. In the public library the steel construction rests upon the
walls of the building, not the reverse, and steel supporting columns
are entirely avoided. The great spans between the walls are mostly
bridged over with box girders, but also with plate and lattice girders
between which are iron beams. The span of the box girders is 66
feet. Fig. 59 gives a representation of the steel construction of the
floor. The spaces between the floor beams are filled in with large
porous terra-cotta blocks. The steel beams and supporting columns
are also encased with terra cotta, which makes them absolutely fire-
proof. The floors are laid in cement, upon which are set marble
mosaics, glazed tile, or parquetry, the last, however, only in offices
and workrooms, where it is covered with coreacin, to the value of
about $3,500. The gang plates at the book stacks are made of hard
glass or tile. The walls are wainscoted or lined with marble. Window
casings and sashes,-as well as book stacks, are of iron (costing about
$30,000), the other furniture (costing about $66,000) and the doors
are of wood. On the latticework, doors, and elsewhere much rich
bronze work is used. For important documents and rarities special
fireproof vaults with iron cases are provided, as shown in fig. 60.

On account of the swampy foundation of Chicago the library rests
upon 2,400 piles, each 55 feet long and of 12 inches diameter, that are
driven to an average depth of 75 feet below the level of the street

« Whether or not this is to be ascribed to the strong shaking alone I will not state
positively. It is also possible there is some fault with the cement base. In any
event, however, these tremors can do no good to the building. I even see that they
endanger its permanence, and that ultimately an engine room will have to be built
outside.

Long lengths of fire hose are distributed everywhere. Very ingenious
and important also is the installation of the water system on the three
sides of the building with houses opposite, by which, from the roof
downward, a screen or veil of flowing water can be set in motion in case
of fire, an arrangement that has already on one occasion practically
proved its usefulness, and which is certainly worthy of imitation. The
accessory stairways are of iron. The delivery room can be shut off
from the adjoining book stacks by steel roller shutters. No fire is
allowed except that for heating in the basement. In the book bindery
and in the rooms reserved for employees at the noon hour, ete., electric
heating apparatus is used. Everything, in fact, is done to reduce the
danger from fire toa minimum. If one wished to be rigorously crit-
ical, it might be adversely mentioned that the furniture, such as tables,¢

stools, etc., as well as doors and elevators, are of wood, although there
is no real danger, as the woodwork is very massive. Notwithstanding
this, the building has recently been insured for $500,000, at an annual
premium of $1,000, for the special reason that the adjacent buildings
to the westward are quite near. The night service consists of a watch-
man and engineers, the latter working in shifts of eight hours. The
cleaning is for the most part done during the night, using the electric
light (there is no other) as is needed.

In an equally successful manner the architects have solved the prob-

« The table tops are unusually massive, but have the disadvantage of warping, so I
found a great number of them, on this account, put aside for repairs. In the work-
ing and office rooms some of them are, as an experiment, covered with linoleum.
Iron tables with linoleum cover would certainly be preferable. There is, too, excel-
lent iron furniture for rooms, made in America (see remarks on this subject, p. 380
et seq. ).
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 483

lem of everywhere providing abundance of lights The high, broad,
closely spaced windows and the court (see plans) everywhere admit so
much daylight that nothing better could have deen devised. This is
especially the case on the eastern and northern sides; also in the
delivery room with its large windows at both ends and the glass cupola,
as well as in the reading rooms frequented by the public and at the
book stacks. Only a few inner rooms of the ground floor are so dark
that artificial light is necessary in the daytime.

The demand for convenient access to the public rooms has also been
successfully met. The delivery room of the second story, frequented
daily by thousands, is conveniently reached by the magnificent stair-
way of the south entrance unless it is preferred to use one of the four
elevators near by, while the reading rooms of the north and east sides,
which likewise are daily visited by thousands, can be directly reached
by four elevators, by the south stairway, or by the central stairway.
It is a special and novel architectural characteristic of this library that
the reading rooms are situated at the top, while elsewhere they are
ordinarily placed in a central hall, at ground level, and lighted from
above, an arrangement that occupies a large ground area and has,
besides, many other disadvantages, as is well known to everyone
from experience. For this reason the new public library in New
York, as already mentioned, adopted the plan of putting the reading
rooms in the third story. Besides, the rooms can be much more
quickly reached by elevators than by stairways, only as in the Chicago
Public Library, there must be a sufficient number at the disposal of
the public. The greatest care has been given to these elevators.
They are operated by electric power, therefore run quickly and noise-
lessly, can be easily stopped or started, and their doors open and
close automatically by atmospheric pressure. They are perfect. The
grill work of the elevator openings at each story is of bronze, and the
elevators themselves are ornamented with much beautiful bronze work.
Besides the eight elevators for the public, there are two for the internal
administration and six smaller ones for transporting books to and from
the stacks. The elevators cost about $21,000.

The heating is effected by a direct-indirect system with steam-heat-
ing coils for use in cold weather and hot-air blast for milder weather.
It is kept up entirely by the exhaust from the engines, and its cost is
therefore relatively slight. Recently the so-called smokeless coal has
been used, whereby about $6,500 a year have been saved. The tem-
perature is in some cases regulated automatically by thermostats, but
usually on the spot by the opening and closing of heating flues.

Ventilation.—In the basement seven fans draw out of the building
327,000 cubie yards of air an hour through gigantic sheet-iron pipes
and seven others blow in 280,000 cubic yards of fresh air. This air
is warmed in cold weather, washed by passing through sprays of water,

opened, and thus the entire
excellently devised system
was rendered useless. At the
time of the very high tem-
perature that prevailed in
Chicago at the beginning of
September, 1899, I found the
rooms intolerably warm, es-
pecially those with an east
and southeast exposure, in
spite of the open windows and
many electric fans placed
everywhere. It could not

first none of the windows
were arranged for opening,
the plate glass being set in
solid iron frames with cross-
bars. By this arrangement
only purified air could enter,
except such as streamed in
through the doors which
open onto the street. This
was very essential for keep-

the apparatus did not work
satisfactorily. The rooms

ventilating system, I visited the operating room of the Chicago Tele-

It was put in because dust
was injurious to the electric

day and night they do nothing
but make and break connec-
tions, a slavery indeed.” The

been operating for a fortnight,

windows were open, so that
the noise of the street was
very annoying. I learned that

The employees complained
that they were accustomed
to heating by stoves and

and illness to the new system
of heating. It was only the
novelty of the method and
their own prejudice that set

better. It will, therefore,

States. In the public library it has meanwhile been recognized that
the reason for the ineffective working of the apparatus lay, among other
things, in the insufficient speed of the fans, and it is decided to replace
the motors by more powerful ones, as well as to set up two new spray
chambers. Perhaps, too, the air could not be sufficiently cooled by the
existing machines, since by proper apparatus for passing it over ice it
may be kept at a temperature of 18° F. lower than the external air.
As I have already mentioned, in speaking of the Newberry Library, the
system works excellently in the Library of Congress at Washington.
Further experiments in the Chicago Public Library will, however, be
important, for if the system should ultimately be perfected it may be
introduced into museums in smoky cities, such as Dresden, where it
would bring about an extraordinary improvement, for there is now no

end to the cleaning and renovating. Some of the collections are even
closed twice a year for a fortnight for thorough cleaning.

The books themselves are installed in a most complete manner.
They are placed directly behind the delivery room (see Plate 30, where
behind the arches two rows of book stacks may be seen), in whose
immediate neighborhood are placed 75 per cent of the books in
most demand, so that mechanical devices for service at the stacks,
such as I expect to describe in the Washington and Boston libraries,
can be dispensed with. The stacks are of iron and are made by
the Art Metal Construction Company (former Fenton Metallic Manu-
facturing Company) in Jamestown, New York, referred to above,
which firm also made the excellent repositories for the library of
Columbia University in New York (see p. 371). The stacks stand with
interspaces of 40 inches, and are arranged in from 3 to 6 decks, each
7 feet to 7 feet 6 inches in height. They are 1 foot 33 inches wide and

double faced, so that a depth of 73 inches is provided for the books;
eight or nine rows stand abreast in a room separated by a middle pas-
sage into two groups each 14 feet long. Each such stack, 13 feet 9
inches long, is divided for the purpose of fastening the shelf supports,
into five sections, each 2 feet 9 inches long. The passageway is 4 feet
2 inches wide, and the side passages about 40 inches wide. The
stacks in the public library are of a light blue color, covered with a
lacquer which feels like velvet, so that the books can not be injured;
all angles in addition are rounded. The shelves, of iron, are easily
adjusted by means of grooves | inch apart; practical holders, adjusta-

ble above, prevent the books from falling down on shelves not entirely
full (fig. 65). The space between the shelves is usually about 9 inches.
The stacks are entirely open, so that air can circulate freely, which is
considered important for the ventilation of the books. Whether expe-
rience has shown that books on open shelves are preserved better than
those in closed cases is unknown to me. Around the bottom of the
stacks (see fig. 66) and along the walls run ventilating slits. Fig. 66

the books lie upon rollers and slide from right to left, so that any
injury to the binding is avoided. This is a very excellent although
costly apparatus, especially used in case of valuable works upon art,
in which the library is not poor, and which are much used. The wires
for electric lights run inside of the book stacks in protected conduits
which above are brought out into the aisles and bear the incandescent
lamps (see figs. 66 to 68).

Elevators driven by electric power carry the books between the

story. On the southwest side of the ground floor are the rooms from
which books are sent out to the 65 delivery stations of the city. The
book stacks are connected with these rooms by pneumatic tubes of 3
inches diameter, speaking tubes, and telephone, as well as by two
service elevators.

The telephone system of the library is very extensive; 24 rooms can
be connected with each other, and the head bureaus also, with the city
system, through a common switch board placed in the central station
of the building, which must in every case be called up. There are

The electric lighting and all other electric appliances require about 25
miles of wire.

third story. Each catalogue is kept in a wooden case with 500 draw-
ers® that hold nearly 500,000 cards; 200,000 in each are already in use.
The cards for use by the public are perforated and strung on a metal
rod so secured (in the well-known manner) that the user can not remove
them. ‘The catalogue for use by employees is not so confined. All
the cards in use in American libraries are of a uniform size of 3 by 5
inches. In the Chicago Public Library some of the cards are written
with the pen, some with the typewriter, but many are bought ready
printed. Printed catalogues, which for the small sum of 3 to 15 cents,
can be bought in the library itself, and in all branch stations, are pre-
pared for the use of the public.”

“Such card catalogue cases are also made in America, out of iron, especially by
the Art Metal Construction Company, of Jamestown, from which the Dresden Zoo-
logical Museum obtained a small one.

bIn his full report Doctor Meyer gives details of the catalogues and statistics of
the contents of the library, which are omitted from the present translation.
49() REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The public library contains books for home reading, reference works,
periodicals, public documents, and books on the fine and decorative
arts, the total in 1900 aggregating 258,498 books.

The present book stacks suffice for 300,000 volumes, but about
$11,000 is now being spent in constructing additional ones that will
accommodate 90,000 more, and there is room enough for stacks to
accommodate 200,000 besides, but if the structure referred to above is
built over the west court and the rooms now used by the Grand Army
of the Republic become free to the library, the building may contain
2,000,000 volumes. There is, therefore, space available for a long
period of future growth.

In the great periodical reading room of the third floor 1,030 current
periodicals and newspapers are displayed.

The reference room adjoining is as unrestrictedly accessible as is
the large hall. It contains, in its wall repositories, dictionaries, ency-
clopedias, bibliographies, handbooks, ete. (2,000 volumes in all), that
the public can use directly without application at the desk. It is not
possible to state how many volumes are here consulted, but it is cer-
tainly many hundreds of thousands. In 1900-1901, 121,709 persons
visited the reading room and used 336,103 volumes which, at their
request, were given to them from the library.

In 1900-1901, 1,772,741 books were lent to 79,605 persons, averaging
5,813 on week days, 284 on Sundays and holidays, the maximum
being 10,005 on February 23, the minimum 4,424 on September 12.
Sixty-six per cent of these lent books, 1,164,320, came from 65 branch
stations in the city.

More than 4,000,000 volumes, including pamphlets, parts of period-
icals, and newspapers, are annually used in the Chicago Public Library.
In 1900-1901, 1,800,000 were lent out and 600,000 (estimated) were
used in the library and its six branch reading rooms. The number of
books, periodicals, and newspapers consulted or taken from the open
shelves, and of which no record was taken, must be estimated at not
less than 1,600,000, based on the number of daily visitors given above.

All of this will give an idea of the all-embracing activity of the
public library. That so great an organization, which does so much
good, can not be cheaply maintained is obvious. In 1899-1900 the cost
of the maintenance, defrayed by the city, was $263,397. There was
paid out for salaries in 1900-1901 the sum of about $136,000; in 1899-
1900 the branch stations cost $23,717 and the fuel $8,068.

The library has 208 employees, 59 of whom are women, and include
1 librarian, 1 secretary (also treasurer), 3 assistant librarians 8 heads
of departments (circulating, delivery stations, reference, binding, read-
ing room, registry, ordering, patent department), and 110 assistants.

At the head of this powerful and admirable institution is a board of
9 directors. The mayor of Chicago annually names three of these

directors, who serve for three years, the appointments being confirmed
by the city council. The board of directors reorganizes itself yearly,
chooses its president and vice-president and appoints six committees:
On the library, administration, delivery stations, buildings and
grounds, finance, and by-laws; the secretary of the library acts as
secretary to the board. Unstinted praise is due these men, who, with
the active staff of the public library, devote their energies to so great
a task and solve it in so successful a manner. I am sorry that Iam no
longer young enough to assist in establishing a similar institution in
Germany. In the public library of Chicago one learns how much we
have to do in this field. Our schools may be better than those of
America; of that, however, I am not ina position to judge; but the
means which we furnish adults, by which they can, without expense
and without difficult conditions, further educate themselves, are
entirely insufficient. We need an intellectual counterpoise for the
purpose of freeing men from pot-house living and women from back-
stairs literature, and for this a free public library of the best type is a
powertul lever.

In my account of the Chicago Public Library I have only been able
to touch upon the principal matters, being obliged to omit many
interesting and instructive details.

« 16. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.
{Founded by John D. Rockefeller. |

The University of Chicago was opened in 1892. It possesses a rec-
tangular piece of ground about 35 acres in extent, 2,075 feet long, 875
feet wide, covering six city blocks” in the southern part of Chicago,
between Jackson and Washington parks, distant two-thirds of a mile
from the former and one-fourth of a mile from the latter, on the Mid-
way Plaisance, a strip of park that unites the two. The original plans
contemplated the establishment of a great museum, but as the Field
Columbian Museum arose in the near vicinity, that idea was abandoned
and, instead of forming a great collection for public exhibition, it con-
fines itself more to scientific collections for teaching purposes. Those
at present provided, independent of the collections of the separate
institutions, are displayed in two museums, the Walker Museum and
the Haskell Oriental Museum. Both were designed, as were all the
buildings of the university,? by Henry Ives Cobb, the architect of the

«Now much more, 1903.

>I could not give all the study to these that they deserved, and have, in the fol-
lowing remarks, consulted the annual registers of the university and the annual
reports of the president, as well as an article by Prof. F. Starr, in Appleton’s Popu-
lar Science Monthly, October, 1897, pp. 784-805; also taking from the latter some
illustrations. During my visit to the university, as I was endeavoring to obtain
some information at the office, a student heard me, constituted himself as my guide
and accompanied me everywhere during the whole day. This shows the uncom-

building for the Historical Society and of the Newberry Library (see
p. 459), in the English Gothic style, the material being a fine-grained,
eray sandstone, the treatment being very pleasing and agreeably
diversified, and, in spite of the avoidance of superfluous decoration,
not monotonous.

WALKER MUSEUM.

The Walker Museum, named after the donor, is a three-storied
building that cost about $130,000 and was opened in 1898. It lies
with its broad sides toward the north and the south, which is unfavor-
able to the entire south side, for, as an excess of light thus comes from
that quarter, the lighting of the cases would be improved if some of
the windows were closed. It is seldom that a museum is too well

Fig, 69.—University of Chicago. Walker Museum.

lighted. It occurs here because of the narrowness of the window
piers and from the circumstance that the principal hall, on the ground
floor, forms an undivided room, and therefore the light falls into the
relatively small hall from all four sides, thereby causing annoying
reflections. The building is fireproof throughout, and is heated by
steam from the university plant. The ventilation is insufficient. The
cases are of wood, with broad frame work and doors that slide up and
down; they are primitive, and not dust proof. A practical arrange-
ment is used for the consultation of maps which are Kept in large

monly helpral Hiaeoneon which iar fhe Meena a which il hae

gratitude his attentions to me, by which I was saved much time.

drawers that run in grooves screwed upon the inner side of the doors
of the cases. These doors open only far enough to make right angles
with the case, so that when drawn out the drawer serves as a table.
The museum contains between 400,000 and 500,000 specimens, and
is open all day on week days. The collections embrace anthropology,
geology, geography, mineralogy, petrography, and historical paleon-
tology (illustration of the succession of the faunas and floras in the
history of the earth), with many models, casts, maps, photographs,
etc. Upon the ground floor are exhibits relating to the above-named
sciences, as well as to Mexican antiquities. Upon the second floor are
the collections for study (for the most part in drawers), besides work-

rooms, a library, and lecture rooms. On the third floor are the col-
lections for study in anthropology, with instruments for measuring,
maps and graphic representations relating to the aborigines, with
collections from Mexico and Peru, from the pueblos of New Mexico,
the cliff-dwellers of Colorado, the Moki Indians of Arizona, the
Aleutes, and the northwestern coast of America, Japan, ete.

The museum is managed by the professors of the University, with
a few assistants.

HASKELL ORIENTAL MUSEUM.

The Haskell Oriental Museum is dedicated by the donor to the
memory of her husband. It isa three-story building, costing $100,000,
and was opened in 1896. At the present time the second floor only is
devoted to the museum collections, which include a biblical exhibit;
494 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

one of comparative religion; an Assyrian exhibit, consisting mostly of
vasts, and an Egyptian collection. The objects relating to the Japanese
Shinto religion should be especially mentioned, as they are very seldom
seen in other museums. The greatest space is devoted to the Egyptian
collection, to which new material is constantly being added by the
Chicago Society of Egyptian Research, founded in 1897. The lighting
of the rooms is excellent, being more satisfactory than in the Walker
Museum, as the building lies with its broad sides to the east and west.
The remaining stories contain, temporarily, lecture rooms, seminary
rooms, library, and the like, but they will later be used for collections.
The founder established two lectureships at $20,000 for lectures on
the relations of Christianity to other religions, one series of which is

delivered annually at the university, the other delivered in alternate
years in cities of India. In 1899 the subject for the first was Chris-
tianity and Buddhism in six lectures between August 6 and 22.

Because of the recent establishment of all the institutions of the
university it follows that they satisfy the most modern requirements
and are models of their kind. The buildings are fireproof through-
out, but with wooden furniture and stair coverings, as well as wooden
door and window casings, which might as well have been avoided, at
least in those buildings where there is danger from fire because of the
kind of work carried on therein. I must confine myself to brief
notices of these several buildings, accompanied by illustrations, for if
I were to treat them as fully as they deserve I should far exceed the
limits set for this report.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 495

KENT CHEMICAL LABORATORY.

The Kent Chemical Laboratory was named for the donor of the
building. It cost about $240,000, and was opened in 1894. It has three
stories. On the ground floor are four lecture rooms, the largest hold-
ing 300 persons, a Museum, and some workrooms; in the second story
there are laboratories for advanced students, and a library. In the
third are laboratories for beginners. I mention, in all cases, only the
principal rooms. Six private laboratories are provided for the pro-
fessors and teachers. For ventilation several fans drive in air of a
constant temperature below, and one fan expels above.

RYERSON PHYSICAL LABORATORY.

The Ryerson Physical Laboratory was named by the donor of the
building in memory of his father. It cost $225,000 and was opened in

Fic, 72.—University of Chicago. Ryerson Physical Laboratory.

1894. It has four stories, and is of especially heavy and solid construc-
tion, in order to diminish tremors. The walls are wainscoted with
marble, and the wall shelves of heavy slate on piers of masonry. In
the walls and floors are a system of ducts and channels, so that pipes
and wires may be laid from one part of the building to another with-
out difficulty. The heating is automatically regulated according to
the direct-indirect system. Injurious effects are produced by the
engines, three dynamos, and workshops in the basement. On the
ground floor are laboratories for advanced students, mechanical work-
shops, etc. In the west wing are rooms free from iron devoted to

.
496 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

researches in electricity and magnetism. On the second floor there is
a large general optical and chemical laboratory, a large lecture hall, |
and other rooms. On the third floor isa laboratory for beginners, a
lecture hall, and other rooms. Here also is provisionally established
the mathematical and astronomical department of the university.
The central part of the fourth floor forms a hall for experiments
requiring a large space. The roof above this is flat and suitable for
observation in the open air.

HULL BIOLOGICAL LABORATORIES.

The Hull laboratories (fig. 73) are four buildings, erected according
to a common plan, connected partly by covered cloisters, and forming

three sides of a large court. They were given by Miss Helen Culver and
named in memory of her uncle. They were opened in 1897. In the
letter of presentation it was said that the whole sum of $1,000,000
should be devoted ‘*to the increase and spread of knowledge within
the field of the biological sciences,” and that a portion of it should be
applied for sustaining an inland experimental station and a marine
laboratory and to the regular delivery of popular lectures upon the
advances of science in sanitation and hygiene. It was also provided
that only one-half of the sum should be used for the erection of
buildings, but that the interest on the other half should be applied to
the support of research, instruction, and publication. In accordance
with this plan a zoological, a physiological, an anatomical, and a
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 497

botanical institute have been built, each specially adapted to its own
ends, and it should be particularly mentioned that the architect has
not allowed himself to sacrifice either space or light to the require-
ments of the Gothic style. The open side of the court is turned
toward the center of the University grounds.

The Hull Zoological Laboratory, shown in fig. T4 on the left, has
four stories, 130 feet long and 55 feet deep. In the basement there
is an aquarium, vivaria, preparators’ workrooms, and the like, as
well as a room for paleontological material, as paleontology in the
Chicago University, is distributed in a rational and progressive way
among the biological sciences. On the first floor is a museum, a general
biological library, and the laboratory for beginners. On the second
floor are only zoological laboratories. Upon the third floor there is a
laboratory for comparative anatomy and embryology and one for
cellular biology, as well as single zoological workrooms. Upon the
fourth floor are laboratories for bacteriology,” as well as rooms for
paleontology.

In summer, work is also carried on at the marine biological station
at Woods Hole, Massachusetts (Marine Biological Laboratory), which
is allowed the pupil in reckoning his prescribed hours of work,
although the station is not ranked as belonging to the Chicago Univer-
sity. The director of the zoological laboratory of the university is

early part of 1899, upon the water of the Mississippi, and the Ilinois and its tributaries,
as it was desired to discharge the sewage from Chicago by that route. Up to that
time it had been discharged partly through the Chicago River into Lake Michigan,
which not only changed that river into a reeking sewer but also polluted the pota-
ble water supply of the city. In spite of the fact that the lake water was pumped
from the lake, 4 miles away, through subterranean channels, Chicago remained
unhealthy, with frequent cases of typhoid fevers and other diseases. Now, through
a canal 30 miles long, reaching as far as Lockport, a union has been effected with
the Desplaines River, and throngh that with the Illinois and the Mississippi, and the
city thus freed from noxious materials without, it is alleged, injuring the dwellers
upon the other rivers, as the sewage is extraordinarily diluted by bringing the
water of the lake into the canal (11,000 cubic yards a minute, which could be raised
to 22,000 cubic yards). The question has even arisen whether, through this enor-
mous withdrawal of water, the level of the Great Lakes will not become permanently
lowered, so that the shipping interests, which are very active, may be injured
thereby. The canal, which was finished in seven years and opened in 1900, also
serves for ship transport. It is 175 to 317 feet broad, from 16 to 22 feet deep. It
cost the city about $35,000,000, but this was not too high a price to pay for the
benefit which it wrought. The Hull Bacteriological Laboratory has been especially
adapted for this task, and has, among other things, already undertaken a great
number of chemical and bacteriological researches in order to prove whether any
appreciable effect will be produced by the introduction of the diluted sewage into
the canal and the great river system involved.

by rail from Boston, therefore more than a twenty-four hours’ journey
from Chicago. It is supported by several universities of the United
States and publishes, among other things, biological lectures of a more
or less popular character, which are given there. The U. 8. Fish
Commission of Washington also has a station at Woods Hole.

The Hull Botanical Laboratory, shown at the right in fig. 74, has four
stories, and is 112 feet long and 56 feet wide. The rooms of this
building are also especiatly well lighted. The greenhouse is 75 feet
long, 33 feet wide, and easily reached by an elevator. It affords space
for growing plants under different conditions (tropical, arctic, desert,
aquatic) in order to experimentally determine their influence over the
organism. ‘The temperature and moisture can be exactly controlled.
Underneath, in the fourth story, are rooms chiefly for the study of
_ plant physiology, a chemical laboratory, a workshop, and others. In

the third story are studied the taxonomy and morphology of erypto-
gams. In the second story are the great ‘herbarium, an excellent
library, laboratories, etc., and on the ground floor the lecture rooms
and the large general laboratories for beginners. Parts of the base-
ment and of the ground floor are temporarily occupied by the printing
establishment of the university. :

The Hull Physiological Laboratory, seen in fig. 75, has four stories,
is 112 feet long and 55 feet wide, and is connected with a green-
house for the rearing of insects and plants. Inthe basement are a
cold-storage room, a marine aquarium, a vivarium with excellent
appointments, a workshop, etc. On the first floor is the laboratory
for beginners, a lecture room, a photographic room, and galvanometer
room. In the second story is the large lecture hall, with a practical
arrangement for lantern projections, the library, an optical room, two
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 499

dark rooms with heliostat, prisms, ete., for the purpose of studying
the effects of monochromatic light upon living organisms, etc. In the
third and fourth stories are laboratories for physiological chemistry,
vivisection rooms, etc. In the institute special attention is given to
the study of comparative physiology, and the completeness and excel-
lence of its appointments for this purpose can not easily be surpassed.

The Hull Anatomical Laboratory has four stories, and is 131 feet
long and 55 feet wide. The studies here embrace human anatomy,
histology, histogenesis, microscopic anatomy, embryology, and espe-
cially neurology and experimental psychology. In the basement is
a cold-storage room, a crematory, a bone room, etc. The first story
is devoted to psychology, with a collection of instruments that cost

over $2,000, among which are instruments of Helmholtz, Du Bois-
Reymond, Ludwig, Hering, Kiihne, Ewald, Konig (I cite only a few
Germans), and many others, and to histology. There is also a photo-
graphic workroom, etc. In the second story are other rooms for
histology and neurology, which is here especially cultivated. In the
third story is a large lecture hall and dissecting rooms for human
anatomy. In the fourth story is a vivarium and laboratories for special
research.
YERKES ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY.

The Yerkes Observatory is situated about 75 miles from Chicago on
Geneva Lake, Wisconsin, and about 14 miles from Williams Bay, a
little town on the lake. It was founded in 1894 by Charles T. Yerkes,
5OO REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

at-a cost of $300,000 and was opened in 1897. In spite of its youth
it has already obtained a world-wide reputation under the direction of
Prof. G. E. Hale. As I have not visited it I can only give a notice
compiled from various sources. As early as 1892 Charles T. Yerkes
conferred with Messrs. Harper and Hale concerning its foundation,
and the latter in 1898 had the plans drawn up. The site was selected
with care so as to be as free as possible from disturbances. It is 220
feet above the lake and 1,300 feet above sea level. About 50 acres of
woodland are included in the site. The building, likewise designed by
Henry Ives Cobb, is T-shaped, its principal axis (361 feet) lying east

and west. The dome for the telescope, which is 75 feet long with an
objective of 33 inches, is at the western end and is 98 feet in diameter.
This great telescope” is moved by an electrical apparatus, and the floor
of the observing room, 82 feet in diameter, can be elevated and is
movable through a range of 26 feet by means of electrical motors
(fig. 77). A spectrograph, a photoheliograph, as well as a stellar and
a solar spectrograph are attached to it. In the eastern wing, which
runs north and south, is the heliostat room, 108 feet long and 13 feet

largest in existence. One was made for the Paris exposition of 1900 having an

room, laboratories, photographic rooms, offices, ete. In the basement
also are similar rooms, as well as an excellently equipped workshop.
The power house is isolated from the observatory.

Fic. 77.—University of Chicago, The great telescope at the Yerkes Observatory.

Besides this the university has within its own grounds at Chicago
a small astronomical observatory for the instruction of beginners, and
about a mile and a half north of it in the city a second one, the Kenwood
Observatory, for the instruction of advanced students in physical and
practical astronomy and astrophysics, for which it is completely
equipped.
502 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.
LIBRARY.

Since 1893 the library has been temporarily installed in a nonfire-
proof building,“ situated in the northeast corner of the university
grounds. This is entirely insufficient and extraordinarily crowded, so
that the building of a second temporary building was contemplated
when J. D. Rockefeller, on Christmas eve, 1900, made a preliminary
donation of $100,000 for a new structure. The university had already,
in 1891, bought for about $17,000 the Calvary secondhand bookstore
in Berlin, which was estimated to contain 280,000 volumes and 120,000
pamphlets, but was indeed much less and not as valuable as was
expected; and it had also obtained in 1891 the entire library of the
Baptist Union Theological Seminary, of Chicago, in 40,000 volumes.
In 1899 the entire number of books possessed by the university
amounted to 325,000 volumes? and 150,000 pamphlets (estimated),
71,235 volumes of which were in the 25 departmental libraries of the
various institutes and seminaries, where, however, they are adminis-
tered from the central library by a cuperaendetn, an inspector, and
four assistants. These reference libraries are completely catalogued
according to authors and partially according to subjects. They con-
tained in gross, in 1900, the following numbers of volumes: Theology,
9,350; biology, 7,685; political economy, 6,181; Engtish, 5,432; his-
tory, 5,433; German, 4,920; Latin, 4,415; geology, 4,260; sociology,
3.703; philosophy, 2,914; romance languages, 2,905; political science,
2,651; and mathematics, 2,503.

COBB LECTURE HALL.

The Cobb Lecture Hall (fig. 78) was founded in 1892 by S. B. Cobb,
at a cost of $225,000. A structure for a lecture hall was already in
process of erection, so that on October 1 of that year the official open-
ing of the university was celebrated in it, and it has remained its
central point. It is 170 feet long, 82 feet wide, and 55 feet high, up to
the roof. There are 23 lecture halls that hold a total of 800 persons—the
largest, 78 by 45 feet, holding 400 persons; the second in size, 45 by 33
feet—besides the offices of the university. It is aboutto be united with
the central heating plant.

GYMNASIUM.

The gymnasium is a temporary structure that in 1892 was built on
the north, near the built-up portion of the university grounds, at an
expense of about $18,000. The portion for men is 220 feet aE and
55 feet wide, the hall 154 feet long by 55 feet wide; 420 lockers serve
for depeeietne clothing. There is a running track 440 feet long, laid

wide, of which 55 by 33 feet is devoted to bathrooms, dressing rooms,
lockers, ete. The women’s portion is to be torn down, as the site is
assigned to a students’ clubhouse and mess house. A special room
serves for the physical examination of students, which is obligatory,
and also for a library. The university physician not only continually
supervises the hygienic appointments of all the buildings and the state
of health of the students who consult him without charge, but he also
informs himself especially as to their physical condition for intellectual
work. Although the appointments of the gymnasium are good in
themselves and compare well with those of Germany, yet they are by
far unequal to those of Columbia and other American universities, and

physical culture and athletics is a widely embracing one, correspond-
ing to the great part which athletic games play in American univer-
sities, too great, as appears to me,“in comparison with the too slight
part given to it in Germany. In spite of the considerable receipts of
the division, amounting to about $35,000, of which about $30,000
alone were derived from admission fees to the football games, paid
by the public, there was in 1898-99 a deficit of $250.

POWER HOUSE.

A central power house for heating and for electrical supply was
erected as long ago as 1892 alongside the university grounds, separated
from them bya street. It is 131 by 138 feet in size. The engines are
fed by coal oil provided by J. D. Rockefeller, the founder and
chief supporter of the university. The present house is, however, no
longer sufficient, and there has been begun the construction cf a new
brace central power house for electricity, heating, and water, from
sabre subterranean conduits will be led to all the buildings of the uni-
versity. It will be 300 feet long and 50 feet wide at the ground level,
with a chimney stack 145 feet high, and will include a workshop for
repairs. It will contain, among other things, an electric crane, for
handling of coal and the like, that can be moved along the entire
building.?

DORMITORIES.

The outer fronts of the four corners of the four southern blocks of
the university grounds, taken as a whole, are devoted to dormitories.
Here they stand, isolated, with great lawns that serve as playgrounds,
the quadrangles in front planted with trees and decorated with beds of
flowers. Only one portion is now built. There are four such quad-
rangles—one for women and one for graduate students, and two for
the undergraduates. The row of houses in fig. 79 represents some of
the dormitories for male students. On the right hand (near the Cobb
Lecture Hall, fig. 78) is the north hall, especially for graduate stu-
dents, and therefore formerly called the graduate dormitory. This
row of houses corresponds to those seen at the left in Plate 32. Up to
the present time there have been established four dormitories for men
and four for women, the former being able to accommodate 236, the
latter 220 students, a total of 456. The number of students in the
university in the year 1899-1900 was 1,734 men and 1,449 women, a

total of 3.183, and in 1900-1901 there were 3,612, but it should be
remembered that the maximum number of resident students at any one
time during the latter year was only 2,000.

D06 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The yearly expenses of maintenance at the University of Chicago
are officially stated at $287 for a minimum and $655 as a liberal allow-
ance, $396 as an average for thirty-six weeks’ work. The honorarium
for tuition is always the same, $120, the price for rent and care of room
varies from $42 to $225, the board from $100 to $225, laundry from
$15 to $35, text-books and stationery from $10 to $50. Still one may
live more cheaply, for a room near the university may be had for $1 a
week, including heating and lighting, or with board for $4.50, and
board alone in student clubs for $2.75 to $3.50 a week.

I may also mention that the house of the president of the university
stands near the southwestern corner of the grounds, therefore near the
dormitory for women (extreme right of Plate 33). The president holds
regular receptions, whereby the social life of the university is kept up.

As appears from the plan of the buildings of the university grounds
and their vicinity, which is attached to the annual register, it was the
intention to line the four blocks originally assigned to the university
somewhat symmetrically with buildings.

In the middle transverse zone is the university hall and library, “
together with the chapel; at the four corners are the dormitories, with
large rectangular lawns in front of them; in the middle longitudinal
zone are variously shaped large, ornamental plots; and the remaining
portions are more or less symmetrically filled with buildings of which
there were 52 planned in all. Besides some provisional structures and
the observatory at Lake Geneva, 17 of these have been completed,
namely, 2 museums, 6 natural history institutes, 1 lecture hall, 8 dor-
mitories; 21 are contemplated or in course of construction, 3 for
modern, 2 for ancient languages, | for geology, 1 additional museum,
2 additional lecture halls, 7 more dormitories (one in course of con-
struction), a hall witha library, a dining hall (building), the chapel, the
gymnasium (building), the power house (building), and finally 14 whose
special purposes have not yet been determined. In this original
scheme of buildings, however, there are not included the two northern
blocks, which, in 1899, Mr. Marshall Field, together with Mr. J. D.
Rockefeller, presented to the university ata cost of $330,000. But
after the Rush Medical College,’ that is to say, the medical school,
with nearly 1,000 students, which up to this time, situated in West
Chicago, has been only externally associated, has begun to settle down
with the university,’ and, further, after the Pedagogical Institute of
Chicago, funded with $2,000,000, has been transferred to the univer-
sity,” a rapid advance will probably be made in the erection of addi-

tional buildings, if, indeed, this has not already occurred, for in
Chicago matters develop so quickly and unexpectedly that descriptions
frequently fall short of the reality.”

HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY.

If we take into account the buildings and installations established,
created from nothing, since 1890, when the university was planned,
up to 1899, we can only regard with astonishment the ‘*‘ phenomenally
‘apid growth” of Chicago University, as it is generally spoken of; yet
those far-seeing men at its head have still greater aims in view which
they will also attain.

The University of Chicago is all-embracing in the sense that it seeks
to compass for both sexes the entire, broad domain of knowledge from
the elementary school up to induction into independent research. But
before I attempt to sketch its complicated organization, which differs
in many points from that of other American universities, it may be
proper to review its brief and eventful history, especially with regard
to certain outside matters.’

A ** University of Chicago” was founded as long agoas 1857, but it
was obliged in 1886 to close its doors on account of financial difficul-
ties. It sprang from the bosom of the Baptist Church, which also
again took steps for the founding of a new university. In 1888 J. D.
Rockefeller, of New York, conferred with Dr. W. R. Harper, profes-
sor of Semiti¢ languages at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut,
in regard to the reestablishment of the university in Chicago, as this
appeared to him the duty of the Baptist denomination of the country,
and also entered into communication with the American Baptist Educa-

«How true this remark is may be illustrated by the fact that while I was revising
my manuscript (in July, 1901), I received news from President Harper that corner
stones for the following buildings had recently been laid: The press building, a
dormitory for undergraduates (Hitchcock Hall); the university dining hall, with its
kitchen; the University tower; the clubhouse for university students, an assembly
hall (Mandel assembly hall) and the school of education. I also learn from news-
paper notices, that L. Mandel, of Chicago, gave $100,000 for the assembly hall; J. J.
Mitchell, of Chicago, $50,000 for the tower; the executors of J. Reynolds, in Chicago,
$80,000 for the clubhouse, and a great business man, who wishes to remain anonymous,
$100,000 for the dining hall. The school of education will cost $1,000,000.

®In 1897 H. Moissan wrote a brief sketch of the University of Chicago, which was
translated and published in the Report of the Commissioner of Education for the year
1897-98 (Washington, 1899), II, pp. 1443-1447. He there relates, among other things,
that a professor at a university, without any ceremony, presented him from the col-
lection a piece of fossil wood that pleased him, and that was neither numbered nor
catalogued. He instinctively looked around to see if they were observed. He adds:
“It is only in America that one sees such things.’’ With regard to this I might
properly say that one will hardly find anywhere such careful cataloguing as in the
American museums, and that if that professor gave him the specimen he was doubt-
less authorized to do so.
508 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

tion Society, which was founded in Washington in 1888. The result
of the conferences which the society carried on was that in 1889
Rockefeller contributed $600,000 as an endowment fund, the income
only of which could be used for current expenses, and under the con-
dition that within a year $400,000 should be given by other parties for
the purpose of parchasing land and erecting buildings thereon. This
condition was fulfilled in 1890, and in addition Marshall Field, of
Chicago, presented land for half of the site, the other half being
bought for $132,500, altogether three blocks, to which, in 1891, a
fourth block was added, costing $150,000, and in 1898 a fifth and sixth
block, costing $340,000, toward which Mr. Field again contributed
$135,000 and Mr. Rockefeller the remainder. The cost of the land
ageregates, therefore, up to the present time, over $750,900.

On September 10, 1890, the University of Chicago was incorporated
as such by the State of Illinois, its objects, as set forth, being to serve
for the higher education of both sexes on equal terms, its man-
agement being confided to a board of 21 trustees, two-thirds of whom,
as well as the president of the university, must be members of regu-
lar Baptist churches, the university to have, however, a purely literary
and scientific character, and no professorship or place of any kind to
be dependent upon a religious test. A few days thereafter Mr. Rock-
efeller again gave, to be invested, $1,000,000, four-fifths of the pro-
ceeds to be used for the general purposes of instruction and one-fifth
for the theological faculty, and Prof. W. R. Harper was appointed
president. The latter accepted the office on July 1, 1891, and has ever
since been the active force of the whole enterprise, as in fact he had
been since 1888, constantly maintaining the view that it ought to bea
real university and not a nominal one, as are so many in the United
States. It was further arranged that the Theological Seminary of the
Baptist Union in Morgan Park, Chicago, established since 1860, be
constituted the theological faculty of the university (divinity school)
under this condition, among others, that a dormitory costing $100,000
should be erected for the accommodation, without charge, of the theo-
logical students, in consideration of which the academy of the univer-
sity should be established in the buildings at Morgan Park. With the
seminary the university also obtained a theological library of 40,000
volumes, as previously mentioned.

From January, 1891, to May, 1892, there were six bulletins pub-
lished on the plan of organization of the university which had been
previously submitted to the criticism of more than 50 American insti-
tutions for higher education. In 1891 the heirs of the first mayor of
Chicago, W. B. Ogden, endowed a faculty of natural sciences (Ogden
Scientific School) for physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astron-
omy. This was under a provision of his will that prescribed that 70
per cent of his property should be devoted to charitable purposes.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 5O9

Up to 1898 $300,000 of this had been liquidated and $200,000 more are
expected. In the same year occurred the purchase of several hundred
thousand books and pamphlets comprising the library of the Calvary
Antiquariat at Berlin. In 18928. A. Kent, of Chicago, gave $235,000
for a chemical laboratory, Mr. Rockefeller another endowment of
$1,000,000, and Mr. Field $100,000 for buildings, under the condition
that within three months an additional sum that should raise the total
to $1,000,000 should be secured for the same object from other parties.
This was done in Chicago itself; the sum was even exceeded, and many
complained that they had not been asked to contribute. S. B. Cobb had
given $150,000 especially for a lecture hall; G. C. Walker $130,000 for
a fireproof museum; M. A. Ryerson $150,000 for a physical laboratory
(to which he added in 1894 $75,000 more) and $50,000 besides; Mrs.
N.S. Foster gave $60,000; Mrs. E. Kelly and Mrs. J. Beecher each
$50,000, and other ladies $18,000, all for dormitories for women;
Mrs. A. J. Snell $50,000 for a dormitory for young men students,
and in addition to this there were 20 leading business men of the city
who together guaranteed $100,000 in case the required sum was not
forthcoming.

In order to show the farsightedness that animated the men of the
university, I will mention that in June, 1892, when there had already
been a Jarge staff of teachers appointed, though as yet there was not
a single student, and when everyone had his hands full with organiza-
tion and installations, $250 was granted for the American School of
Classical Studies at Athens.

On October 1, 1892, the university was opened to students with a
ceremony exclusively of a religious character. Only the lecture hall
and three dormitories were ready; for everything else rooms had to
be rented in the neighborhood. Asa slight recognition of the indebt-
edness which was felt toward Mr. Rockefeller it was voted that the
words ‘* Founded by John D. Rockefeller” be added to all official
reports, publications, and correspondence of the university. In the
Same vear this founder gave still another sum of $1,000,000 as an
endowment for the compensation of instructors. On January 1, 1893,
the university had a teaching corps of 172 persons, of whom there
were 73 professors (4 German) and 61 fellows for 594 students, nearly
one-fourth of them being women. In 1893-94 a fund amounting to
$1,000,000 was formed for the general equipment of the university, of
which Mr. Rockefeller contributed half, M. A. Ryerson, of Chicago,
$100,000, the remainder coming from various sources. In 1894 Mrs.
C. E. Haskell, of Chicago, established an oriental museum at a cost of
$100,000, adding $40,000 for lectures on comparative religion, and
Charles A. Yerkes, of Chicago, founded an observatory with $300,000.
In 1895 the total number of students was already more than 2,000.
From 1893 to 1896 Mr. Rockefeller had given for various purposes,
510 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

besides the bequests already mentioned, $400,000, and in 1895, for the
fourth time, he made an endowment of $1,000,000, and promised
$2,000,000 additional in case a like sum was contributed from other
sources by 1900, and this was also done.” Further, Miss H. Culver, of
Chicago, in 1895 gave $1,000,000 for biological sciences (see above,
p. 496), and Mrs. A. Hitchcock, of Chicago, gave in 1900 $200,000 for
a dormitory for young students and the endowment of professorships.
The gifts in the year 1898-99—the school year runs from July to
July—reached a total of nearly $750,000, $500,000 of which were
from Mr. Rockefeller. Besides his $2,000,000 gift which was due
April 1, 1900, he gave in the same year another $1,000,000 for capital
stock and $500,000 for immediate use, with the desire that $100,000
of it should be employed for a building for the library and press. In
all, the university had obtained up to the end of 1900,° $13,000,000
from private subscriptions,’ but not a penny from the city, State, or
General Government; of this amount Mr. Rockefeller alone has given
$9,000,000, and all but $1,000,000 of the remainder he has in a man-
ner incited, in that a condition was attached to his gifts that such
and such sums must be raised from other sources.? In 1899,

“ Concerning this transaction the most fantastic statements were published in the
German papers. Thus, a Berlin paper informed its readers that the university would
have been bankrupt had not this sum been forthcoming; a Dresden one, on the con-
trary, said that President Harper raised it in twelve hours, while he had been four
and one-half years doing so, even this being a most astonishing performance.

bSee New York Weekly Tribune, December 20, 1900.

¢ At the decennial celebration held June 18, 1901, President Harper said, among
other things, that while one could see now what it was possible to do with $10,000,000
to $12,000,000 for the establishment of an institution for higher education, yet before
half of the new century had elapsed the world would know what $50,000,000 could
do for that purpose. (Chicago Record-Herald, June 19, 1901, p. 2.)

@ Besides, Mr. Rockefeller by no means confines his benefactions to the University
of Chicago, and by his example has perhaps done more than by his gifts them-
selves. (Quite recently Andrew Carnegie, of Pittsburg, has surpassed him in gifts
for educational purposes (see p. 474), crowning these during this year (1901) by
giving to the four universities of his native land, Scotland, $10,000,000 in order to
elevate them and to assist the students. In 1902 Carnegie gave the same sum
for an Institution for Scientific Research in the City of Washington, 1903. John D.
Rockefeller was born in 1839; his father was already living in the United States.
Disparaging statements are made here and there as to the way in which he
acquired his wealth (for example by F. de Norvins: Les Milliardaires Américains,
Paris, 1900, p. 100 et seq.), but more shrewd than the robber knights of the middle
ages, to whom many of our first families owe their wealth, he has certainly not kept
up his practices, and it can therefore likewise be said for him: non olet. In America
to-day a rich man may not keep his money or leave it chiefly to his relatives. Public
opinion compels him to other methods of disposal. In Boston it is epigrammatically
said that no one would dare to die without leaving something to Harvard University,
and a minister in Brooklyn humorously remarked that he would not preach the
funeral sermon of any rich man until he knew what his will was. It is unjust to
inveigh against great fortunes when their possessors support our hospitals, libraries,
and universities (see The Justification of Wealth in The Nation, LX-X, 1900, p. 66).
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. bt

$5,500,000 of the total fund of $13,000,000 were invested, yielding a
secure annual income of $210,000, or 29 per cent, toward the payment
of the total expenditures of $780,000, the students contributing
$270,000 (37 per cent), while Rockefeller gave $200,000 (28 per cent),
and the small remainder was derived from various sources. The
expenditure for salaries of the instructors was, in round sums, $390,000
(54.7 per cent), stipends “$60,000 (8.5 per cent), for printing and publish-
ing $50,000 (6.8 per cent), for expenses of buildings and grounds
$83,000 (11.5 per cent), for books $14,000 (1.9 per cent), the remaining
16.6 per cent for general expenses.

According to a statement which occupied almost an entire closely printed folio page
of the Chicago Tribune, January 1, 1901, p. 17, there was given by private persons in
the United States in 1899 $80,000,000 for educational purposes, libraries, museums,
charitable objects, churches and religious enterprises, as well as to cities for the pub-
lic benefit and entertainment, sums. under $1,000 not included. In 1900 the total
was $62,500,000, of which there was applied to educational institutions, museums, and
libraries $40,000,000, Washington University, in St. Louis, obtaining $5,000,000, the
Carnegie Museum, in Pittsburg, $3,500,000; the University of Chicago, $2,600,000;
Clark University, in Worcester, Mass., $2,400,000; Yale University, in New Haven,
$1,300,000; Brown University, in Providence, $1,000,000; the Cooper Union, in
New York City (see p. 366), and the University of Syracuse each $830,000; Har-
vard University, in Cambridge, $730,000; Drake University, in Des Moines, $530,000;
Columbia University, in New York, $500,000, and so on. During the year 1901, besides
he donations amounting to $1,300,000 already mentioned, there were known to
me the following great gifts from Chicago alone: Dr. D. K. Pearsons, who from
1890 to 1900 had already given $2,500,000, almost wholly for educational objects, in
sums of from $15,000 to $300,000, disposed during his lifetime of the remainder of his
property, amounting to $1.500,000, for the same objects, having especial regard to the
small colleges of the West, retaining only for himself and his wife an annuity of
$30,000; and J. O. Armour, together with his mother, gave to the Armour Institute
(school of engineering) $1,250,000, after his father had founded the same with
$4,000,000. According to the American Monthly Review of Reviews, August, 1901,
p. 152, the endowments for American colleges and universities in June of this year
were greater than ever before. Among others, Brown University, in Providence,
obtained $2,000,000, and Harvard University, in Cambridge, $1,000,000 for its med-
ical faculty. ‘The best of all uses of public benefactions is not for charity to the
poor or even to the sick and defective, * * * not for lower education or religion,
* * * but rather for affording the very best opportunities for the highest possible
training of the very best minds in universities, because in training these the whole
work of church, state, school, and charity * * * is raised toa higher level, and in
his service all other causes are at the same time best advanced.’? (The Nation, LXX,
1900, p. 229.) This, too, has always been the German principle, and to that end the
governments of single states and the representatives of the people have cherished the
universities with the greatest care, so that in Germany the most and best universities
are found. In America this is sought to be attained partly through state and partly
through private universities, and there can be no doubt but that it will also be
attained there.

“These are the so-called scholarships and fellowships, the first for junior students,
the last for those who have attained the doctorate. They vary from $125 to $440.
In consideration of this the recipients have to perform a service at the University of
from one and one-half to two hours daily.
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

In 1899-1900 the university had 3,183 students, of which 1,449 were
women, and in 1900-1901, 3,612 students with 240 teachers and 25
administrative employees (11 women, 4 with title of professor), who
receive salaries varying from $400 to $7,000. Among the instructors
were 12 Germans, and 53 had studied in Germany. In 1900-1901
there were 1,200 lectures, mostly arranged in courses of three months’
duration, corresponding to what, as we shall see, is known in Chicago
University as the quarter system.

FEMALE STUDENTS.

The number of female students in Chicago University has increased
from year to year. In 1892-93 it was 24 per cent; 1893-94, 33 per
cent; 1894-95, 35 per cent; 1895-96, 36 per cent; 1896-97, 37 per
cent; 1897-98, 38 per cent; 1898-99, 48 per cent; 1899-1900, 45.5
per cent, in a total of 3,183 students, there being 1,449 females and
1,734 males.“ The dean of the women says, in the introduction to a
highly interesting annual report,’ that in the University of Chicago
these relations are much more simple than in most other institutions
for common instruction. From the beginning each and every one of
the women has stood on the same terms as the men; never in the world
was the work of women as scholars less hampered, and nowhere is it
sasier for women to obtain a university training. The woman student
on entering the university is subject to the same rules as the man stu-
dent, proceeds in exactly the same manner in respect to choice of
studies and business relations and shortly finds herself in class room,
laboratory, and library, working side by side with men, and with no
question as to her right or privilege.

QUARTER SYSTEM WITHOUT VACATIONS.

Another essential characteristic feature of the University of Chicago
is its quarter system almost without vacations, which has introduced
an entirely new principle into university instruction, which thus con-
tinues on unbroken. The quarter is the unit of reckoning, as is the
semester in Germany. The academic year begins on July 1 and is
divided into four quarters, which begin respectively on the Ist of
July, October, January, and April, and last twelve weeks, there being

“In the winter semester of 1900-1901 there were at the 21 German universities
among 34,363 students and some 2,000 auditors (summer semester, 1901, 35,552
matriculate students), 1,029 women, 12 of whom were matriculate and probably
about one-third of whom were foreigners (it was only at Jena that no female students
were allowed, but they are now admitted—1903). In the United States in 1898-99
there were 109,659 males and 37,505 females who enjoyed the higher education, of
which 18,948 women were at universities and colleges for both sexes, 4,593 at higher
women’s colleges, and 10,866 at such of lower grade, 1,339 at technical schools, 1,759
at professional schools. (Report of Commissioner of Education, 1898-99, II, 1900,

a recess of one week at the end. Each quarter has two equal terms
of six weeks. The courses are classified as majors and minors. A
minor calls for four to five hours of class-room work (or its equiva-
lent) each week for six weeks; a major requires the same for twelve
weeks. Eight to ten hours work a week is called a double minor
or double major. _ The prescribed amount of work for each student is
three minors, or one major and one minor in each half quarter. One
major and two minors will also be allowed if it is evident that a stu-
dent is properly using his time. Naturally the courses in a particular
science usually last over several terms, six weeks is only the unit, but
they must be so adjusted that anyone, without disadvantage to him-
self or the subject, can begin at the beginning of a quarter.

Each instructor teaches thirty-six weeks during the year, ten hours
or its equivalent a week. He enjoys a quarter’s vacation, and is
free to choose it whenever it can be arranged, or he may take two
vacations of six weeks each at different times of the year. If he
voluntarily teaches according to agreement more than the normal
amount he can obtain for it either a pro rata in salary (two-thirds the
usual amount) or an extra vacation (full pro rata). Here, also, the
custom prevails of allowing a so-called sabbatical year to the professors
(see p. 367) but under more favorable conditions than are allowed in
the other universities. Whoever lectures throughout three years of
forty-eight weeks or six years of forty-two weeks receives, a year’s
leave of absence with full pay.

RELIGIOUS FOUNDATION.

A third characteristic of the University of Chicago which deserves
to be mentioned, at least in a comparison that most nearly concerns
me—namely, that with the German universities—is the religious foun-
dation which underlies the entire institution. As we have already
seen, the university owes its origin to the religious feeling of
J. D. Rockefeller, who regarded it as a duty owed to the Baptist
Church, of which he was a member, that something should be done for
the elevation and instruction of the people, and although he did not
in the beginning have something grand in view, yet through the influ-
ence of prominent men he was soon brought to consider it.

Although the articles of incorporation require that the president
of the university and 14 of the 21 trustees shall be Baptists, yet it
was stipulated from the beginning that the university should beara
purely literary and scientific character, and that no position of any kind
should be dependent upon a religious test. This has been strictly
adhered to, and, besides, in 1899 the university congregation, which is
a governing body composed of over 200 members, meeting quarterly
or oftener, made the following public announcements:

1. That the principle of the complete freedom of teaching for all

NAT MuS 1903——33
514 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

and every one has prevailed in the Chicago University since its begin-
ning as a fundamental proposition, as is shown by the conduct of the
president and of the trustees and in the actual practice of the presi-
dent and the professors.

2. That this principle shall never, neither now nor in the future, be
put in question.

That it is desirable, in order to be always clear upon this subject,
that the university, as such, should not take part in public affairs and
that public expressions by the professors relative to public matters
shall be regarded as personal.

ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY.

It remains to sketch the organization of the university. This is not
yet fully completed, for it has, as vet, only a theological faculty
(divinity school), with an annex of an English theological seminary,
a Scandinavian theological seminary, a philosophical faculty (graduate
school of arts and literature), and a faculty of natural sciences (Ogden
Graduate School of Science). There will later be organized, as soon as
means allow, a law faculty, a medical faculty,” a faculty of engineering,
a technological faculty, a pedagogical faculty’—one for the fine arts
and one for music.

The university includes five divisions: (1) The schools, colleges, and
academies; (2) the university extension; (3) the university libraries,
laboratories, and museums; (4) the university press; (5) the univer-
sity affiliations.

The first division includes the faculties which have just been men-
tioned (schools), the colleges for art, literature, natural science, com-
merce, and administration and university college. Each of these
colleges is again divided, as is usual, into a junior and a senior college.
Finally, there is the academy in Morena Park, a secondary school.

The second division, the university extension, directs the work of
students who can not attend the daily exercises of the university.° It
conducts lectures at places more or less distant from the university
(lecture study department), study by correspondence (even in foreign
countries), examinations for outsiders, and the library; that is to say,
the utilization of the brary for students not at the university itself.

the university, and part of the medical lectures will be held there. This, then, now
constitutes the medical faculty. 1908.

>This faculty is now constituted by the recent transfer to the university of the

¢ The English call this extension of university instruction the People’s University,
for its benefits are open to all. It rightly is regarded as absurd if anyone considers
that he has ended his education at any definite time, for it can only be ended by
death. Alexander von Humboldt was not ashamed to attend lectures even when
an old man. I must refrain from giving here a special description of the Chicago
University Extension.

STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 515

The third division includes the general library and all the depart-
mental libraries, the general and special museums, the laboratories,
apparatus, and all other material used for instruction.

The fourth division includes the publications of the university, the
printing office, the purchase and selling of books, apparatus, and other
means of instruction, as well as the literary exchange.

The fifth section includes the relations with institutions which, with-
out belonging organically to the university, have affiliated themselves
more or less with it.

The officers are the president, the chaplain, the recorder, the regis-
trar, the deans, the directors, the professors, and the teachers. They
are arranged, for the administration of the university, into the uni-
versity congregation, the senate, the council, seven faculties,” and six
university boards,’ each of these bodies with a prescribed function
which I will not particularize here. Over all are the 21 trustees, who
choose from among themselves a president, a vice-president, a treas-
urer, a comptroller, and a secretary.

The following sciences were, in 1899-1900, taught in the University
of Chicago, each constituting a department: Philosophy, pedagogy,
political economy, political science, history, archeology, sociology,
anthropology, comparative religion, Semitic languages and literature,
biblical and Patristic Greek, Sanskrit and Indo-European comparative
philology, the Greek language and literature, the Latin language
and literature, the Romance languages and literatures, the Germanic
languages and literatures, the English language and literature, includ-
ing rhetoric, literature, mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry,
geology, zoology, anatomy, physiology, neurology, paleontology,
botany, rhetoric, Old Testament literature and interpretation, New
Testament literature and interpretation, biblical theology, systematic
theology, church history, homiletics, church polity, and pastoral
duties. At the same time there are 25 seminaries and_ scientific
institutes. °

«These are not taken in the sense of the faculties at the German universities. The
seven faculties of the University of Chicago are: (1) the faculty of the Morgan Art
Academy (elsewhere, instead, the faculty of the teachers’ seminary is mentioned);
(2) the faculty of university extension; (3) that of junior colleges; (4) that of senior
colleges; (5) that of the graduate school of arts and literature; (6) that of the Ogden
(graduate) School of Science; (7) that of the divinity school. Only the three last
correspond to faculties in the German sense.

¢In Leipsic there are 54, of which, however, 16 are in the medical faculty which
is just about to be established in Chicago.
516 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.
ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS.

As characteristic of the University of Chicago, there deserves to be
mentioned the secondary school connected therewith (university acad-
emy in Morgan Park.) It was opened in 1892 in the former theological
seminary that was merged with the university, and, like all the sec-
ondary schools of the United States, was for both sexes. Recently,
however, girls have been excluded because the pupils all live in the
house itself and not, as in many other secondary schools, in their
families.“ The school is about 7; miles distant from the university,
and consists of a row of buildings, a library with 5,000 volumes, dor-
mitories for 170 pupils, etc. The academy is attended for from four
to five years, preparation for college being thus attained. The
instruction includes Latin, Greek, French, German, mathematics,
history, physics, chemistry, botany, and geography. This secondary
school belongs to the pedagogical department, as does also an elemen-
tary school situated near the university, which accommodates 100
children of an age from 4 to 14 years, and costs $13,000 annually.
These are considered as necessary for the pedagogical department, and
are, so to speak, laboratories in which problems of elementary and
secondary education are to be worked out. ‘* No work can commend
itself more heartily to the attention of the investigator than the study
of the growth and development of the mind of the child, and the adap-
tation of educational theories to such growth.” <A similar establish-
ment on a larger scale has recently been organized at the Columbia
University in New York,? and at the Chicago University there has
recently been laid the cornerstone of a school of education for which
$1,000,000 are available, and which will contain an elementary school
for kindergarten instruction and for instruction in beginnings, a sec-
ondary school (academy) provided with a manual training school, and
a normal school.

UNIVERSITY EXTENSION.

The university extension concerns itself chiefly with lectures in
Chicago and in neighborhoods more or less remote, on philoso-
phy, pedagogics, political economy, history, scciology, anthropology,
Semitic languages and literatures, Greek language and literature,
Romance languages and literatures, English language and literature,
astronomy, geology, zoology, neurology, botany, music, art, Old and
New Testament literature and interpretation, and in this the director of
the art institute and employees of the Field Columbian Museum take
part; these also are docents in the university. In 1898-99 there were
125 such courses held. Besides this, the university extension gives

«There are many secondary schools in the United States in which pupils of both
sexes live in the school itself. These are the so-called boarding schools.

Mann School, by 8. T. Dutton.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 517
instruction by means of correspondence in the above-named sciences,
as well as in theological seminary work, for such as have not attended
any college. In 1898-99 1,049 persons availed themselves of such
correspondence courses. It has been shown that many of the best
students of the university have been brought to the university by
means of correspondence study, and that many of the best students
have been carried along in this way while necessarily absent from the
university.

UNIVERSITY AFFILIATIONS,

The university permits certain institutions to aftiliate themselves
with it in order, through their influence, to favorably affect primary
and secondary schools, as well as colleges, with a view to raising them
to a higher level. This affiliation occurs in four forms—organic mem-
bership in the university, semiorganic union with the university, alli-
ance between the university and completely independent institutions,
and tentative affiliation.

UNIVERSITY PRESS.

The publishing division of the university deserves special mention,
especially as it is destined to great development. Quite recently the cor-
ner stone of a new building for its use has been laid.“ The University
Press consists of four departments: Publications (offices now estab-
lished in the botanical laboratory building); printing (now established
in the gymnasium); purchase of books and apparatus for the entire
university, entirely done through this office, and bookstore and
stationery for students and teachers (now established in Cobb lecture
hall). The following are regularly published: The Annual Register,
a comprehensive annual publication in quarto, which gives much infor-
mation concerning the university; The President’s Report, an annual
publication in quarto; The University Record, a weekly paper; Cir-
cular of Information of the Graduate Schools and Colleges in the
Departments of Arts, Literature, and Science; Circular of Infor-
mation of the Divinity School; University Handbook; Circulars of
Information of the University Extension Division; Calendar of the
Morgan Park Academy; Departmental Programmes. The following
periodicals: Journal of Political Economy (quarterly); American
Journal of Sociology (bimonthly); American Journal of Semitic
Languages and Literatures (quarterly); Biblical World (monthly);
Astrophysical Journal (LO numbers per year); Journal of Geology
(bimonthly); School Review (10 numbers per year); Elementary School
Record (monthly); Botanical Gazette (monthly); American Journal of
Theology (quarterly). Besides there are the following, which appear
from time to time: Contributions to Philosophy (I-lV); Economie
Studies (I-IV); Studies in Political Science (I-III); Studies in Class-

518 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

ical Philology I-V); Germanic Studies (I-III); English Studies (1);
Physiological Archives (I); Anthropological Bulletins (I-III).¢ In
1898-99 there were expended for these about $41,000, about $6,500 of
which was for salaries. In the printing office there were 20 to 40
typesetters employed, but the forms were sometimes printed outside.
Besides the above-named official publications, the printing office also
issued in 1898-99: Proceedings of the National Educational Associa-
tion; Fifth Herbart Year-Book; Smith: Chemistry Outlines; Report
of the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools;
Report of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary
Schools; Proceedings of the Southern State Association; S. W.
Burnham: Catalogue of Double Stars, I (publication of the Yerkes
Observatory); J. Dewey: School and Society (already in its 3d edi-
tion); Manual Training Magazine. In the book and stationery store
there were sold in 1898-99 articles to the value of about $39,000. It
is an unusually convenient arrangement for the professors and students
that they can enjoy, within the university itself, a well-assorted book-
store, where they also receive a considerable discount.

CONCLUSION.

As I stood one beautiful clear evening in Indian summer upon the
tower of the lofty Masonic Temple of Chicago, fanned by soft breezes,
my glance swept far to the eastward over the unlimited expanse of
smiling Lake Michigan, overarched by the blue heavens; on the west,
however, the dark red sun laboriously struggled through the unsightly
vapor that poured from the smoking, steaming Babel, from the mil-
lion-mouthed monster of a city, a hell—yet looking out upon a
seductive paradise!

‘*Chicago is the young giant among the cities of the earth, and is
only at the threshold of its destiny,” says a recent English observer.
‘* We hope that during the coming years there will be removed from
the way many of the stumbling blocks that we all very well know
still exist to-day in this new and unequally developed city; but
Chicago sixty years ago was only a prairie, with a few thousand men
on it,” so wrote to me recently one of my friends from there.

In the description of the institutions which has filled the previous
pages I could do justice to only a portion of the intellectual life of
this city, perhaps the most interesting one of the whole earth, espe-
. clally because of its great contrasts; for to me the view from the lofty
building appeared symbolical, and most interesting for a further rea-
son—because so much is still to be expected from its development more
than from any other city—that it promises to become one of the future

«There are also published by the students: The University Weekly and the Cap and
Gown (a yearly publication).

STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 519

‘*wonders of the world.” The germs for this can be seen shooting
up everywhere.

Many things I have been unable to include within the scope of my
studies. Among these are the technical schools (Armour Institute and
Mechanics’ Institute), the medical schools, the hospitals, the city hall
and county court-house, and others. The last named, double building,
cost $5,000,000, and certainly offers much that is instructive in many
ways as regards museum interests, as do, for example, the correspond-
ing buildings in Boston, which I hope to be able to describe. Recently
Mr. J. E. DuBois, from Dubois, in Pennsylvania, gave $1,000,000
for a Chicago medical school of homceopathic practices, with a hos-
pital, which led me to lament that this large sum was not applied to
efforts more scientific in character than those of homceopathy. I
mention this in order to show how all possible interests find there a
ready advocate. Perhaps there had deserved to be included in my
report a description of a building like the ‘* Monadnock” (named for:
mountain in New Hampshire about 3,200 feet high), which is only
400 feet long and 70 feet wide, but is seventeen stories highand contains
1,200 business offices, with 6,000 persons constantly employed therein.@
It constitutes, by itself, a postal district with 14 employees, who daily
handle 45,000 pieces of mail and sell stamps amounting to $2,000.

Although not in this connection, I might, however, in order to illus-
trate the specially developed talent of the Chicagoans for organization,
as is shown in the incredibly rapid establishment of their museums,
libraries, and universities, mention one interesting installation among
many others, namely, that of the city railway.

Chicago, the city of so many technical surprises, possesses a very remarkable
arrangement of its city railways. From a center where almost the entire business
life is crowded together in 20-story houses within a space of a few square miles, there
radiate toward the south, the north, the southwest and the west, four great electric
lines, elevated on iron viaducts, each 10 to 15 miles long. On the eastern side the
business portion of Chicago is limited, as is well known, by Lake Michigan. The
uniting member and turning place for all the elevated lines, giving at the same time
an opportunity of transfer from one line to another, and yet constituting a line by
itself, is the so-called Union Loop in the center of Chicago, perhaps the most remark-
able and most frequented piece of railway in the world. The loop is a double-track
viaduct about 2 miles long, that surrounds a rectangular area of a portion of the
chessboard-like blocks of the business center. The area is five blocks wide and
seven blocks long, and its seven stations are so arranged that from any point in the
business center it will take not more than three minutes to reach the nearest one.
In this way it is possible to reach a railway going in any direction, for the trains of
all four of the elevated roads, as soon as they get to the business part of the city,
must pass over the loop and stop at its eleven stations before they can again come to
their own line and pass out toward the suburbs. The travel on this loop is enor-

« Life in such a colossus is depicted by H. B. Fuller in his readable romance, The
Cliff Dwellers, which at the time created so unpleasant a sensation in Chicago,
because in it the author unsparingly exposed some of the dark sides of social life
among the swarming millions of the city.
520 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

mous. Onan average day there are 1,000 trains or 4,000 cars used, and during the
busy hours of the day there are always 30 trains at atime upon this short line,
indeed on special occasions, caused by excessive crowding, the tracks of the loop are
literally covered with trains; they often run at intervals of less than one minute
apart. Although the loop is provided with a double track yet all the trains go in
the same direction; the lines that join the loop at three of its four corners are dis-
tributed upon the two tracks, according to their frequency. In the first 14 months
after it was established this remarkable railway was used by 80,000,000 of passengers.
The great business houses situated near the stations have already begun to build
stairways from their second stories connecting directly with the gallery of the station
in order to spare their visitors the trouble of descending into the street. At each
station there is also a special stairway for the trains of each line and a reserved space
is railed off along the track, so that the loop may really be said to have 44 stations.
The whole loop might properly be considered as a single gigantic terminal station
for all four elevated roads, and as the grandest effort hitherto made to unite several
railway lines in a single center. (Newspaper notice).

In conclusion I will name a few of the scientific, literary, and art
associations of Chicago, as far as I heard of them, as these characterize
the intellectual life of the city: Chicago Astronomical Society, Hum-
boldt Club, Illinois Audubon Society, Audubon Club, Entomological
Society, Mycological Society, Polytechnical Society of Chicago, West-
ern Society of Engineers, Literary Club, Ravenswood Historical
Society, Chicago Society of Egyptian Research, Altura Library Asso-
ciation, Chicago Library Club, Bibliographical Society, Book Club,
Central Art Association of America, Chicago Art Association, Art Stu-
dents’ League of Chicago, Society of Western Artists, Illinois Chapter
of the American Institute of Architects, Chicago Architectural Club,
Chicago Ceramic Association, Altura Ceramic Art Club. These, how-
ever, by no means exhaust the list of such societies.

B.—NOTES ON SOME EUROPEAN MUSEUMS AND KINDRED
INSTITUTIONS. ¢

INTRODUCTION.

After visiting, during the autumn of 1899, some of the museums
and libraries of the eastern section of the United States, concerning
which I made a partial report, it seemed to me desirable to revisit
some of the principal museums of Europe, and to examine others for
the first time, in order to have a just measure for estimation of the
American establishments, which profoundly impressed me. The gen-
eral direction of the Royal Collections of Art and Science in Dresden
also commissioned me to do this in view of the proposed, though

recently deferred, erection of a new museum building in Dresden, and
I now report on the result of my observations.

I could not, in the case of cities like London and Paris, undertake
to make as detailed a report as I attempted for New York and Chicago,
and as I hope to do for Washington, Philadelphia, and Boston (includ-
ing Cambridge), for that would require much more time than I had at
my disposal. There is, indeed, no necessity for this, for the museums
and allied institutions of London and Paris are known to every one
who has to do with museum administration. I could only endeavor
to discuss what is new and worthy of imitation there, and what would
be valuable for solying our problem in Dresden.

Although probably noone willtake exceptions to my noting the good
features that I find, yet in case of blame some one is certain to say that
‘‘ those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.” Of course
I am aware of the inadequacy of my own efforts, and I know that in
many instances the deficiencies are to a greater extent the fault of the
circumstances than of the persons, for one individual has little con-
trol of the many combinations on which the historical development of
museums and similar institutions depend. It is rare, at least in
Europe, though possible in America, that anyone has an opportunity
to commence at the beginning and build up an establishment from the
foundation. My censure, therefore, can not and will not be personal,
but will deal rather with the conditions that are beyond the control of
the individual. If I am blamed for recounting my experiences princi-
pally in the form of personal impressions, the reader may be assured
that I do so only for the purpose of allowing others to share them, for
which purpose I can not avoid the subjective method of statement.

The arrangement indicates the course of my travels during Septem-
ber and October, 1901.

Photographs were in most cases difficult to obtain, and my illus-
trations are consequently not uniformly distributed, and in some cases
unsatisfactory. To the gentlemen who were so good as to place orig-
inals at my disposal, and who were in other ways of much assistance to
me, I here make acknowledgment of my sincere obligations.

«The construction extended from 1873 to 1880. In 1886 the installation of the
collections, which were formerly in the British Museum (Great Russell street), was
completed. The building is 675 feet long and has two towers 190 feet high, while

of the first one. The very high entrance hall (Plate 34) appears to me to
be too churchlike and empty. That it looks very dingy is, of course,
due first of all to the London atmosphere, but perhaps also it is due to
the character of the building materials and the yellow color, being of
terra cotta, ornamented with animal representations in high relief.¢
The side galleries with skylights (fig. 83) give somewhat the impression
of factory rooms. ‘The installation is in some respects excellent, but
in many cases is capable of improvement, notwithstanding the fact that
enormous sums have been expended on it. Some groups of birds, for
example, cost as much as $250 or more. Rather too much has been
done in this respect to the greater neglect of other things. The cases
are of mahogany, clumsy and unprepossessing; some of the back-
grounds are green. The labels have been prepared with much care
and taste. The arrangements for lighting are in part deficient. An
anthropological gallery has recently been installed, which promises in
time to be very attractive, but otherwise there has been but little
general change in the twelve years since I last visited the museum.
The number of visitors on the three occasions when I was at the museum
was not great, and one can scarcely feel that there is justification for
exposing these valuable collections to the light from morning till
evening, when it is evident that they will be ruined thereby. If the
shades are drawn, however, it becomes so dark that one can see but
little. Eyerywhere in England the collections are exhibited during
the entire day, and it is said that this custom must continue, for other-
wise the money for expenses will not be forthcoming. I think, how-
ever, that this is an error. If the officials themselves were only
convinced that the collections intrusted to their keeping are really
being injured they would be able to impress this fact upon the trus-
tees, but they fail to consider the subject, or at any rate have neglected
it until very recently. The public would soon become accustomed to
shorter hours of opening if there were some way of making them gen-
erally known. This is not the case now, everyone knowing that he
can gain admittance from morning until evening.

There are no double windows, these always being omitted in English
museums. There is no necessity for them, however, for no annoy-

the large entrance hall is 170 feet long, 95 feet wide, and 72 feet high. Regarding
the style the architect says (General Guide to the British Museum, Natural History,
1888, p. 12) that it is ‘‘earlier Romanesque, which prevailed largely in Lombardy
and the Rhineland from the tenth century to the end of the twelfth century.”’

«The architect says (Guide to the Museum, p. 14): The Museum is the largest, if
not indeed the only modern building in which terra cotta has been exclusively used
for external facades and interior wall surfaces, including all the varied decoration
which this involves. On the western side of the building, where it is intended that
the zoological collection shall be placed, the ornamentation of the terra cotta (which
will be found very varied both within and without the building) has been based
exclusively on living organisms. On the east side, where geology and paleontology
find a home, the terra-cotta ornamentation has been derived from extinct specimens.

ance is caused by frost and melting ice. In most respects the climate
is milder than with us, though single windows are found also in many
other European museums as well as in the large museums of the
United States, where the winters are very cold. In the newly-con-

lights. The Director was of the opinion that the great hall (84 by 30

meters) could not be heated without the double windows. I do not

share this opinion, for in the present day any room can be well heated,
526 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

and moreover, double windows are just as likely to become frosted.
These are not, therefore, necessary in a new building, unless we prefer
them because the movement of air and consequently of dust can be
diminished by their use, and because the dust from the street is less
likely to enter, except when, as we shall see below, the windows are
closely secured and dust-free air is brought in through other openings.

The museum can not be said to be entirely fireproof. Much super-
fluous wood is used, and the location of the heating apparatus is
unfavorable.

The museum has four departments—zoology, geology, mineralogy,
and botany. Its annual expenditure is about $250,000. Each depart-
ment has a keeper who receives from $3,500 to $4,000, and there are
assistant keepers with salaries of $2,600 to $3,200; assistants of the
first class, with salaries ranging from $1,500 to $2,500, and of the
second class, from $750 to $1,500.

Special mention should be made of the publication by the museum,
at its own cost, of systematic descriptive catalogues aggregating con-
siderably more than 200 volumes, with thousands of illustrations. In
this undertaking the British Museum is preeminent and by it has put
deeply in its debt every student of natural science. It excels all other
museums of the earth so markedly in this respect that they sink into
insignificance by comparison. It would be useless even to attempt to
compete with England in this regard. These catalogues are not only
vatalogues of the collections of the museum, but monographs in which
all known species are described, whether they are represented in the
museum or not. There is, however, little that is lacking in the collec-
tions of the British Museum, for, as has already been said, no col-
lections in the world can be compared with them in completeness. — It
is not my purpose here to describe in detail this famous collection.
The most notable exhibits are, perhaps, those in the mineralogical and
paleontological departments, and in the so-called ‘* Index Museum”
of the main hall, which serves as an introduction to zoology and is an
original creation of the former director, Sir William Flower. Many
museums have endeavored to imitate this feature to some extent.
The catalogues mentioned are distributed liberally.

18. BRITISH MUSEUM.
[Great Russell street, Bloomsbury. |]

In the British Museum on this occasion I confined my attention
chiefly to the ethnographic collection. It contains many valuable old
specimens, but has not kept pace with its sister collections. While
Berlin has since the seventies built up an ethnographical collection
which is scarcely to be surpassed, and good collections have been
brought together in many cities of Kurope and America, London has
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 527
made little progress in the latter half of the last century. The former
director, Sir Augustus Franks, a man of Kuropean reputation, and
during the time of his administration (1860 to 1880), the best authority
on ethnographical matters—one might say the teacher of the older gen-
eration of ethnographers—gave in the latter part of his life less atten-
tion to the broader problems of ethnography. However, on account
of the world-wide rule of the English Government, it is naturally and
must continue to be the task of the British Museum to lead in eth-
nography, since that museum has greater opportunities than any
other. This collection nevertheless has not made much _ progress,
and the contents of the ethnographical department of the British
Museum make no better showing than many of the continental
museums, not to mention the Berlin collection. In this stepmotherly
treatment of ethnography the British Museum does not set a good
example to the other museums throughout that country, while the
Berlin Museum, for example, has had and continues to have a fruitful
influence throughout the whole of Germany. In London the antiqui-
ties resulting from the English explorations in the Pacific Ocean (the
British Museum was established in 1753) are, however, still unex-
celled. The arrangement, classification, and labeling leave something
to be desired. The exhibits in halls lighted from above are crowded
and not pleasing. .

In this respect England has allowed herself to be surpassed, but this
fault may be found with all of her ethnographic collections, excepting
that at Oxford (see p. 533).

While much has been generally done in the British Museum in the
way of explanatory labeling, this can not be said of the ceramic col-
lection, which, however, still excels in that respect some of the conti-
nental collections.

The famous library of the British Museum, although it possesses
such magnificent features, can not as a building or in many of its
installations and contrivances compare with the new American libraries.
It requires, for example, from a half to three-quarters of an hour to
obtain a book, and, besides, the facilities for reading are not entirely
convenient. Books are not allowed to be taken home. The printed
catalogues, on the other hand, are unequaled, being—considering the
riches of the collections, for the most part bibliographies, while they
contain also a large number of cross references—admirable works.
G. A. Criiwell “ calls them ‘ta milestone in the history of catalogue
making.” In 1875, the manuscript catalogue having increased to 2,000
volumes and being too unhandy and cumbrous for use, its printing
was undertaken, and was completed in twenty years, from 1851 to
1900, about 400 quarto parts at a price of $450. The increase, how-
ever, is so extraordinary that the printing has been continued, and

29

528 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

there has been published, for example, a three-volume subject catalogue
in octavo, embracing the additions from 1880 to 1895, comprising over
120,000 works. The library receives all volumes copyrighted in Great
Britain and Ireland and in the British colonies, and expends about
$50,000 yearly each for purchases and for binding. As to the number
of volumes erroneous reports are generally circulated. It is claimed
thatthe National Library in Paris is the largest, with 3,000,000 volumes;
then follows the British Museum, with over 2,000,000; then the Berlin
Royal Library, with 1,000,000. Asa matter of fact the British Museum
is the richest, with from four to five millions, of which perhaps half
a million are periodicals that occupy 12 straight miles and embrace
over 30,000 different journals (exclusive of newspapers), in which
respect no other library in the world even approximately approaches
it. In wealth of books, therefore, the library of the British Museum
in London is unequaled, though the number of readers is compara-
tively small—in 1899, 188,554.¢

The total number of visitors to the British Musenm in 1900 was
689,249 persons, of which 43,892 came on Sundays.?

19. OTHER LONDON MUSEUMS.
MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND.

This famous museum of comparative anatomy, whose directors in
recent times have been, in succession, Owen and Flower, can perhaps
be regarded as the best natural-science museum in the world, even
though it does not entirely correspond to the modern standard. It
consists of a series of large halls with skylights and two or three gal-
leries one above the other (Plate 35 represents one of these halls). On
account of this arrangement the light is sometimes insufficient; there
are corners and spaces underneath the galleries which are completely
dark, and the reflection from the glass desk cases in the galleries is
very annoying. The general effect, however, is noble and beautiful.
Much stress is laid upon the admirable method of installation, though
it does not always in every respect represent the highest advances.
The anthropological collection is, in particular, not so carefully and
scientifically installed as far-reaching demands would necessitate, and
the whole museum could be kept much cleaner. There is, however,
not a sufficient labor force for this purpose.

Although the disadvantage of high halls and galleries lighted from
above was known, in order not to depart from the uniform plan of the
interior of the museum a similar large hall has lately been added.
The cabinets and cases are, as is almost uniformly the case in England,
constructed of mahogany—antiquated and clumsy, and not dust proof.

@ In 1900, 198,566; in 1901, 200,035. In 1901, 718,614, of which on Sundays 48,895.

The soot from the air of the city does not penetrate too much into the
building, since, with the exception of the skylights, there are no win-
dows in the halls; a double glass roof, moreover, offers considerable
protection. The ventilation arrangements are primitive.

The library comprises 50,000 volumes and does not incorporate any
books relating to systematic zoology. There is a card catalogue
arranged by authors and subjects.

The collections contain upward of 11,000 comparative-anatomy
preparations, among them upward of 3,700 fossil and nearly 2,700
pathologico-anatomical. Excellent printed catalogues concerning
them are published, among others a Descriptive Catalogue of the
Osteological Series contained in the Museum of the Royal College of
Surgeons of England (2 vols., London, 1853, quarto, xlv, 914 pp.);
a Catalogue of the Specimens illustrating the Osteology and Dentition
of Vertebrated Animals, recent and extinct, contained in the Museum
of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, I-III (London, 1879-1891,
octavo, Ixvii, 1036 pp.); a Descriptive Catalogue of the Teratological
Series in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England
(London, 1893, octavo, xxiii, 192 pp). The collection is, first of all,
scientific, and as such is a true ornament to the nation.

The illustration given is reproduced fromm the Souvenir of the Cen-
tenary of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, 1800-1900 (Lon-
don, 1900, quarto, 33 pp.).

SOUTH KENSINGTON OR VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM.

This famous museum of art and industry is unsuitable as a building,
the lighting being in some parts very bad and the installation much
too crowded and not well adapted for inspection.“ The labeling is
very good throughout, though the cards are printed in such small type
that in the insufficient light they are often quite illegible. On the
other hand, the former India Museum (Indian section), that now
belongs to it, is installed in a primitive, unsystematic manner, and
insufficiently labeled. Furthermore, the ethnographic section, part of
which is very valuable, is not well arranged. The management of the
oriental art collections, which, with the Indian one just mentioned, are
now located in the adjacent Imperial Institute (which, intended in the
first place for collections, is now occupied by the university), is not
entirely satisfactory. New halls, however, are now being erected for
both these large collections. It is impossible for me to do justice to the
tremendous whole of the South Kensington Museum in the space of
this report. Besides, it is generally known. Its excessive abundance
of objects quite oppresses the receptive faculty of the most alert sight-

seer.“ This overabundance constitutes an especial vice of museum
science. Only the best should be readily accessible. Here also the
collections are damaged by being exposed to daylight (also to electric
light) from morning until evening, which is the more regrettable since
a large portion of the exhibits are of such a nature as not to endure
the light at all. The exposure is, therefore, scarcely justifiable.

The number of visitors to the museum in 1900 was 846,489, of which
87,854 came on Sundays. Umbrellas and the like are not deposited
at the door. Visitors are at a disadvantage on account of the small
number of trained attendants. The majority of attendants in nearly
all English museums are policemen, who are engaged only temporarily.
One is therefore unable to obtain information of any value concerning
the collections, and on account of the size of the whole exhibition a
study of the ‘‘guides” and ‘*handbooks” is not to be thought of
unless one is pursuing a single question. Even if a person wishes, for
example, to obtain information about some certain object, it requires
at least an hour or more, on account of the extent of the collection.

The annual expenditure for 1897-98 amounted to $420,000, of which
$70,000 was devoted to the purchase of specimens, $190,000 to sala-
ries ($60,000 to the policemen), $60,000 for cleaning, and $26,000 for
heating and lighting.’ Some very instructive data relating to the
internal affairs of this museum may be found in the second report
from the select committee on museums of the science and art depart-
ment, with the proceedings of the committee, ordered by the House
of Commons to be printed July 29, 1898 (folio, 105 pp.).

NATIONAL GALLERY.

The National Gallery, with its famous collection of paintings, lacks
intimate charm in the style of its building and in the installation of
the pictures. This is emphasized by the great influx of the general
public. Umbrellas, ete., are required to be deposited. In 1901 it was
visited by 478,346 persons on 204 free days, besides 35,704 on 30 Sun-
day afternoons, and 42,177 on Tuesdays and Fridays for an admission
fee of six pence, Bee a total of 556,227. (The Dresden Gallery
had, in 1901, 266,263 visitors. )

NATIONAL GALLERY OF BRITISH ARTS, OR TATE GALLERY.

The Tate Gallery is a new building, in classic style, designed by
S. R. J. Smith and constructed in 1897-1899. I do not regard the

WALLACE COLLECTION,

This famous collection of paintings and works of art is installed in
a palace (Hertford House), which, though it has been to some extent
adapted to its present purpose, yet possesses many disadvantages as a
museum. It is one of the greatest attractions of its kind in London.
It formerly belonged to the Wallace estate, but was later presented to
the nation. Its value is estimated at $20,000,000.¢

ROYAL BOTANICAL GARDENS.

The Kew Gardens, the foremost scientific establishment of the world
in systematic botany, is admirably administered, with an excellent

HORNIMAN FREE MUSEUM. ?

‘*The arrangement of the building is as follows: Connected with
some smaller halls, which are first entered, is a larger one about 108
by 60 feet and 42 feet high, with skylight, and encircled above with
a gallery 6 feet 6 inches broad. These spaces constitute the front
half of the building, and contain a systematically arranged ethno-
graphical collection, chiefly of personal ornaments, which are installed
in the gallery in cabinets. In the rear half of the building, on the
ground floor, the ethnographical collection is continued. The hall is
not provided with any light, and when anyone is admitted it is illumi-
nated by electric lights. Here the objects are arranged more in a
geographical order. The second story of the rear building is on a

Extracts from a report which was placed at my disposal by Dr. O. Richter,
assistant in the Dresden Ethnographical Museum, who visited the Horniman Museum
in February, 1902. I did not find time to visit this museum, on account of its dis-
tance in Forest Hill. From a description by the director, R. Quick, in the Report
of the Museums Association, 1900, pages 58-63 (compare, also, the Horniman Free
Museum, in The Studio, XXIV, pp. 196-202, with 5 illustrations, 1901), I note that
this museum of art and science was built in 1899 by C. H. Townsend, in free Renais-
sance style, fireproof, of red bricks, with limestone front, in which is introducedacrystal
mosaic picture 36 feet longand 11 feet high, after the design of A. Bell. The building
has a bell tower 33 meters high, which contains a water reservoir for supplying the heat-
ing apparatus. The museum is, in its entirety, about 280 feet long and 65 feet wide.
The collections were formerly installed in the residence of Mr. F. J. Horniman, who
had zealously collected them in his travelsaround the world during forty years, and who
allowed his residence to be torn down to make room for the museum. Since 1891 it
has been open to visitors on three days in each week. Between 1891 and 1898, when
it was demolished to make room for the new building, it was visited by 455,591 per-
sons. Since 1891 the director has issued, annually, a brief report, with illustrations.
The library contains 6,000 volumes. There are 7 officials. The entire cost of main-
tenance is defrayed by Mr. Horniman.

level with the gallery of the front half, and consists of a hall (natural-
history collections) with a skylight, about 108 by 60 feet and 42 feet
high, with galleries about it (insects, minerals).

‘*The main portion of the ethnographical collection is arranged by
classes, as in the museum at Oxford (see p. 533). The cases are of
mahogany, and also black, with panes of plate glass, 8 feet high, 40
inches broad, and 1 foot 7 inches deep, with sea-green background,
and similar shelves, which show up the contents very distinctly. The
labels are printed in black letters on a white ground pasted on a red-
bordered card. Nearly every specimen has a label. The exhibit is
very clean, intelligible, and elegant. The entire museum can be lighted
by electricity, a portion of the lights being supported by brass mount- _
ings in the modern pendant style. In the dark adjoining room are
placed apparently such parts of the ethnographical section as could
not find place in the main hall without injuring its fine general effect,
or whatever was unsuitable for exhibiting. This room represents
the storehouse of the exhibition series. Eastern Asia and India are
especially well represented, but there is also a fine Benin collection
(see Seventh Annual Report, 1897, pp. 18, 19, Plates 11—-v), as also some
things from New Zealand.

‘In the zoological collection there are three fine animal groups,
the elk, the walrus, and the polar bear.”

BRITISH FIRE-PREVENTION COMMITTEE.

I should not omit mentioning an institution, praiseworthy and of
unusual importance to museums, namely, the British fire-prevention
committee, which has issued publications since 1898. These may be
obtained at the offices of the committee (No. 1 Waterloo place, Pall
Mall, London). The contents of the volumes bear upon the com-
prehensive functions and purposes of the society, as may be wit-
nessed by a few of the titles here given: I (ten articles with many
illustrations, 1898, $2). Fire-resisting floors used in London; Lessons
from fire and panic; How to build fireproof structures. II (ten arti-
cles with many illustrations, 1900, $5). Fire tests with unprotected
columns; Fire tests with floors; Fire tests with ceilings. III (ten arti-
cles with many illustrations, 1900, $5). Fire tests with doors; Fire
tests with partitions; Fire tests with glass.¢ The chairman of the
committee and the publisher of its reports is Architect E. O. Sachs,
London.

It will be seen that I have treated in the above pages only a small
portion of the London collections, and that portion only in the most
cursory manner.

' 20. UNIVERSITY MUSEUM, ETHNOGRAPHICAL DEPARTMENT (PITT
RIVERS COLLECTION).

In Oxford, that famous old university town, which I visited first in
1878, the chief attraction for me this time was the famous ethnograph-
ical collection presented to the Oxford Museum in 1884 by Col. Lane
Fox (later General Pitt Rivers), who died in 1900. Subsequently
Colonel Fox founded a new collection in Farnham (Wiltshire), not far
from Stonehenge, which has become quite as noted, but which, as it
was too far away for me, I did not visit. The ethnographical collec-
tion is in an annex added in 1887 to the university museum, a modern

gothic structure (1857-1860). I pass over the natural-science collec-
tions, as I have no special remarks to make regarding them.“ The
ethnographical collection, however, is distinguished from all other
similar ethnographical collections in the world by the manner of its
installation.

‘In all ethnographical museums a geographical classification is
adopted as the principal basis of arrangement, whereby all objects
from the same region are grouped together—a system obviously

@ Prof. EK. Ray Lankester, of the British Museum, said in 1897 concerning the build-
ing of the Oxford University Museum: ‘‘Our great university museum building is

simply an absurdity.”’ Report Proceedings Museums Association, 1897, pp, 21-22 (1903).
534 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

advantageous from many points of view, and especially to students of
comparative ethnology, as showing at a glance the condition of culture
to be found in any tribe, race, or district. In the Pitt Rivers Museum,
on the other hand, the primary basis of classification which is adopted
and which distinguishes it from other kindred museums, is one like
that employed in the arrangement of most natural-history museums,
the objects being grouped according to their morphological affinities
and resemblances (as it were), all objects of like form and function being
_ brought together into groups, which again are subdivided into smaller
groups—into genera and species, as one might almost say.” (See Bal-
four’s remarks in Report Museums Association, 1897, p.51.) There is
only one larger natural-history museum that is arranged geographic-
ally, and that is the Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cam-
bridge, in the United States, which on that account became famous
during the life of its originator. Its reputation can not now be
claimed to so great an extent, since, although it is otherwise so
important in the scientific world, it tes not in this one respect kept
abreast with the times. There is, however, an example on a small scale
of geographic classification of a zoological collection, which I shall
mention beyond under Dublin. It is therefore possible to study in the
Oxford collection, so to speak, the natural history and the phylogeny
of the various arts and industries of mankind. To this end Pitt
Rivers, so far as possible, associated in groups all like objects from
the various parts of the world in which they occur. By means of
such synoptic series, when fairly representative, geographical distri-
bution of any class of implements, weapons, etc., may be seen and
the relative condition and local variations of kindred or similar objects
may be studied and views formed as to the important question of the
monogenesis or polygenesis of certain widely distributed arts. The
probable lines of dispersal where they have apparently emanated from
one center, may be determined upon incidentally, of course, helping to
throw light upon the migrations of races themselves. Moreover, by
arranging the specimens in each group in progressive series—that is,
by commencing with those objects which appear to be the most primi-
tive and general in their class, and by leading gradually up to the
higher and more specialized forms, the developmental history of the
higher forms may be at any rate suggestively illustrated and material
be supplied for the study of the growth of culture. We are enabled
to form some conclusions as to the variations by which progress in any
given art or industry has step by step been affected.“ Inasmuch as
the prehistoric status of civilized peoples, corresponding to that of
our present lowly-cultured races is included, one learns to understand
better the relics of former times that Ane remained to cultivated

man. Ethnography thus develops into an eminently historical science.
Maps, such as show the geographical distribution of the bow, ete.,
explanatory sketches and photographs, contribute to a better under-
standing of the specimens. Such an arrangement is unusually
fascinating and suggestive, but it should not be without an adjoining
collection geographically installed. Only a great ethnographic muse-
um like the Berlin Museum could carry out both classifications. A
very limited representation of this could formerly be seen in the
Dresden nephrite collection, and additional attempts have been made
in the collection of the East Asiatic Ceramics from the shores of the
Indian Ocean, as well as in the collection of ear and arm ornaments.

Fie. 85.—University Museum, Oxford. (Pitt Rivers collection.) A corner of upper gallery.

But imagine the great mass of ethnographic objects from all the
peoples of the earth arranged in this manner. To present an idea
of what this is I give below the principal groups of the system,
the fundamental principles of which were laid down by Pitt Rivers,
but which have since been developed by the present director, H. Bal-
four. The small subdivisions number many hundreds. Pitt Rivers
originally had his collection in his own private house (he was then
‘alled Lane Fox, only changing his name upon coming into his father’s
estate), but as it increased he lent it to the Bethnal Green Museum in
London, a branch of the South Kensington Museum, where I saw it
in 1878. From there it was later transferred into the last-named
536 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

museum, until it was deposited in Oxford. In 1877 there was pub-
lished a very valuable printed catalogue by Lane Fox.4

Since then, however, the collection has increased, mostly through
donations, and only slightly by purchase and exchange. The annual
expenditure of the ethnographic section of the university museum is
only $1,000, from which also an assistant must be paid, and occasional
smaller sums allotted for additional purchases. Under these circum-
stances its progress 1s all the more remarkable.

Figs. 84 and 85 give representations of the interior. The Gothic
building with skylights is not very suitable and is in some respects
unattractive and unadapted to museum purposes (see, for example, fig.
85, part of a gallery). That the Gothic style is suitable for museum
buildings is demonstrated by several American examples (University
of Chicago, see p. 491), but it must be applied in a very different
manner than in Oxford, where the typical Gothic halls are found
without modification.

The system is as follows:

V. CEREMONIAL IMPLEMENTS.

OBJECTS COLLECTED DURING CAPTAIN COOK’S VOYAGES.

The valuable Cook collections are still kept together in a special
series, for which we should be the more thankful since there are but
few traces found in museums of this early stage of ethnographic sci-
ence relating to the time of the first contact of Europeans with the
South Sea Islanders.

The arrangement of the collection is of such a unique charac ter that
a thorough study, to be satisfactory, should be pursued for at least
5388 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

several weeks. On account of the wealth of its contents, and the
thoughtful manner in which everything has been brought together
and arranged, it is hard to portray it graphically. The collection is
extraordinarily complete in typical specimens, as a continuous effort
is made to fill every gap. Very little has been published concerning
these systematic series. The museum issues annual reports. The
installation, arrangement in detail, and labeling still leave something
to be desired, as is also true of the cases, which, being of the South
Kensington pattern, are somewhat primitive.

The Oxford Ethnographic Museum seems to me to be in the first
rank of establishments of its kind. I confined my attention in Oxford
to the examination of this museum.

VII.—BIRMINGHAM.
21. CORPORATION ART GALLERY AND MUSEUM.

Birmingham has a population of more than half a million people.
In the rear wing of the council house, built in 1878, in the Greek style,
at a cost of $1,250,000, is located the Corporation Art Gallery and
Museum. The rooms are large, insufliciently lighted with skylights,
and in the largest hall is found a gallery. It resembles in its contents,
arrangement, and general mode of administration, the South Kensing-
ton Museum in London, which has served as the pattern for many
English museums, and which also often lends its collections to these
similar institutions. On account of the very great smokiness of this
large manufacturing city the interior of the Birmingham museum is
blackened and not very attractive. On four days of the week it is
open from 10 a. m. to 9 p. m.; on two, from 10'a. m. to 6 p. m. or 4
p- m., and on Sundays from 2 to 5 p.m. For several years, practi-
cally all over England, the museums have been opened on Sundays.
That the exhibits are damaged by such a continuous lighting is certain,
though in this respect it only shares the fate of all English and Amer-
ican collections.

In 1900 a university was founded in Birmingham, for both sexes,
having an endowment of $3,000,000 and an appropriation by the city
and state of $55,000 annually. There is also a library, founded in
1861, containing 260,000 volumes, with a yearly expenditure of
$87,000, which daily circulates upward of 4,000 volumes. I devoted
no time to these two institutions,“ since the university is hardly
organized and the library is not modern.

VIII.— MANCHESTER.

Manchester is an incredibly smoky city, with over three-quarters of
a million inhabitants. Dresden, which suffers a like disadvantage in
Germany, is a veritable paradise in comparison with it. We are
compelled to pity the development of culture which ripens under such
circumstances, and which transforms human habitations into hells.
A noble citizen of Manchester, T. C. Horsfall,“ took it upon himself
to attempt to improve the conditions by both voice and pen, although
there is no probability that he will be successful. J mention among
others the following of his writings: The Relation of Arts to the Wel-
fare of the Inhabitants of English Towns (1894, 26 pp.); The Govern-
ment of Manchester (1895, 46 pp.); An Ideal for Life in Manchester
Realizable if— (1900, 24 pp.), and The Use of Pictures in Education
(1902, 28 pp.). In the second paper mentioned he writes on page 10:

I do not think that in any other country so large a part of the race has been
brought in stature and general build so far below the normal stature and build of the
race as has been the case in east and south London and in the poorer parts of all our
large towns; ? while the continued prevalence of drinking and licentiousness, and the
rapid spread of betting and gambling show that the average mental and moral state
is no better than the physical. * * * The vast Roman Empire fell for lack of
men and the vaster British Empire, however numerous the British people may be,
must also fall for want of men if we continue to allow the health of the bodies, brains,
and hearts of the people of our towns to be sapped as they are now being sapped in
a great part of Manchester.

And in the last-mentioned paper, page 4:

The condition of the town—-the condition of all large English manufacturing
towns—is simply terrible. * * * Ever since I went abroad, for the first time
after reaching manhood, I have felt convinced that, whatever other reasons there
may be for our not being loved, the light apparently thrown on the true nature
of the belief, which England professes to hold, that she is the great civilizer of the
world, by what the greater part of London is and what Manchester and all other
large manufacturing towns are, and are allowed by the well-to-do classes in this,
the richest country in the world, to continue to be, is in itself sufficient reason for
our not being loved or respected, and for our being regarded as the nation which
is of all the most wishful to deceive itself and others. * * * With all that is
sound in his (that is, the King of Ashanti’s ‘‘ poor bloodthirsty King Prempet’’ ) nature
he would know that the life of an unsacrificed Ashanti is preferable to, and only
nominally less civilized than, that of the Ancoats rough and of those rich persons
who are willing to allow their countrymen to be Ancoats roughs.

Ancoats is a suburb to the east of Manchester and has a museum—

Manchester Art Museum at Ancoats—which, in imitation of the Beth-
nal Green Museum in London, provides musical performances and

tion of the university in 1901.

lectures for the poor people of this section of the city and a primary
school, for children from 10 to 14 years of age, in natural history, Eng-
lish history, and physical geography. More is done in this direction
in England than in Germany, although it does not appear to me that
the population is thereby any more enlightened than ours. It is rather
the contrary. At all events, our school education is a better one, and
this can not be brought about by influencing the adults.

All the buildings of the city are of a deep black, and this is coupled
with a smoke-filled atmosphere.” For this reason a great portion of
the population lives miles away about the town, and tens of thousands
may be seen coming into town in the morning and going out in the
afternoon. That the interests of museums must suffer under these
unfavorable conditions is obvious, so I am the more pleased to be able
to call attention here to some noteworthy features.

22. MANCHESTER MUSEUM OF OWENS COLLEGE.

Owens College was founded by John Owens, a Manchester mer-
chant, who died in 1846. Opened in 1851, it has an endowment of
$500,000. It is known as the University of Manchester, with 1,200
students of both sexes and 80 instructors, and constitutes a part of the
Victoria University, which embraces Manchester, Liverpool, and
Leeds, but has its seatin Manchester.’ A million dollars was collected
by subscription, and the aggregate property of the schools amounts
to $3,750,000. In 1870; A. Waterhouse began the construction of a
group of buildings in the Gothic style, which, as remarked under
the heading of Oxford, is not well adapted for museums and the like,
at all events, when it is not restrained. Mr. Waterhouse, who is one
of the most noted architects of England, also designed the new town
hall in Manchester, built during 1868-1877, at a cost of $4,000,000,
and the assize courts, built in 1864 at a cost of $500,000, both in the
Gothic style. In the town hall, which has 314 rooms and a tower 93
meters high, one is at once convinced of the unsuitability of this arch-
itecture when looking at the dark stairways and passages where artifi-
cial lights must be employed even on bright summer days. The
present museum building was constructed during 1886-88. I do not
give an exterior view of the structure, which is in the same style as the
other buildings. Quite recently a large hall (Whitworth Hall) has
been erected adjoining this, at acost of $225,000, for which, however,
the Gothic style is in every way well suited.

The Natural Science Museum of Owens College (the university),
under the curatorship of W. E. Hoyles, embraces mineralogy, paleon-

«Mr. Horsfall also speaks, in a paper published in 1903, of the horrible filthiness
of the air.

tology, botany, zoology, anthropology, archeology, ethnography
(also numismatics), and is well administered. The large ground floor
hall, 100 by 50 feet in dimensions, with side lights on the right and
left and with cases at right angles with the walls, is well lighted
by large windows (fig. 86). One is here again convinced that this
is the only proper method of museum lighting, since the halls on the
second floor, with skylights and two galleries, one above the other
(fig. 87), are poorly lighted and suffer under reflections from the
glass of the cases. The main stairway leads only to this story with
its Jarge rooms, 100 by 50 feet floor space, 40 feet high, while the
two galleries are reached by an inside stairway (fig. 87). The Gothic

architecture has a disturbing effect and detracts from the impressive-
ness of the exhibits, which it overshadows. Then again, because of
the facade, a difference in height, with steps, had to. be introduced in
the interior, which is inconvenient. Thus in the rear of the main
halls already mentioned there is a transverse hall about 72 by 30 feet
in size. The terrazzo pavement is not especially suitable, since, as
elsewhere, it becomes broken. Nonelastic stone floors in museums
are fatiguing to visitors. The wooden cases and cabinets are hardly
up to strict requirements, though generally great care and considera-
tion has been given to the installation of specimens. So many labels
have been provided for the benefit of students that this museum
really, in some portions, may claim to be ‘*a collection of instructive

labels, each illustrated by a well-selected specimen,” which is what. an
ideal museum should be according to the oft-repeated, clever, but para-
doxical and erroneous, definition by G. Brown Goode in Washington.

In cosequence of this, it has little attraction for the general public,
since the scientific atmosphere of the museum is not popularly pleas-
ing. (During 1898-99 the attendance on week days was 30 to 372; on
Saturdays and Sundays, 40 to 450; and the largest attendance for the
year, on Kaster Monday, was 952.) Especially well represented are
the lower animals. The conchological collection is noteworthy. In
the ornithological department I note, among others, 10,000 skins, the
famous Dresser collection, which served as a basis for his ornitholog-

ical works (Palearctic Birds, Bee-Eaters and Rakes). This is well
installed by itself in cabinets with drawers, but is exposed to danger
from fire by reason of being housed in the attic, which is not fire-
proof and contains much wood. This attic has only recently been
added for the purpose. The ethnographical and anthropological col-
lection is only in its infaney (Egypt, Peru, ete.), and is as yet stingily
treated, on account of lack of funds. The library of the museum
comprises 4,000 volumes and has a printed catalogue. The library of
Owens College’ has 62,000 volumes and the school of medicine has
31,700 medical books.

There are employed six trained scientific men, one printer, three
assistants, and two attendants. There are no preparators, all stuffing

and the like being done outside the museum by contract, which is the
practice in most English museums (including the London Natural
History Museum). The annual expenses are $13,500, of which $7,500
is spent for salaries.

From October to May about 25 popular lectures are given (admis-
sion free), for the most part in the museum, principally on
Saturdays and Sundays, on the subjects of archeology, geology, min-
eralogy, zoology, and botany, some of which are intended for children
(for example On the Struggle for Existence in Nature). The total
attendance at these lectures amounts, however, to only about 2,500
persons.

The museum has published the following: Reports (annual) from
1895 on, six pence; Notes (six of these have appeared since 1896, but
they are only reprints of magazine articles); Scientific Guides, partly
illustrated (reprints from journals), 12 of which have appeared at
prices from 2 pence to 25 shillings; Popular Guides, general, with
illustrations, in two editions, six pence, briefer, a penny; altogether
34 publications, some of which are also called handbooks. In addi-
tion, the museum has published labels suchas those describing the sub-
classes and orders of mammals (15 shillings), Families of Mammals
(10‘shilling 6 pence), Families of Birds (10 shilling 6 pence), Families of
Fishes (10 shilling 6 pence), Coleoptera (3 pence), Worms (six pence),
and also maps showing geographical distribution (100 for six pence).
This undertaking is deserving of much thanks, inasmuch as it saves the
expense of printing toother museums; it is unfortunate that the German
museums can make but little use of these labels, since they are partly
printed in English. The Dresden collection, however, some time ago
procured from them and installed the labels of bird families in Latin,
printed inred. It has long been my desire to arrange for duplicates
of the printed labels in the Dresden Museum for transmission to other
collections so as to save them the trouble of preparation. The arrang-
ing of labels for public exhibition requires much time, as they should
be brief, explicit, and complete. It is unfortunate that, up to the
present time, every museum undertakes this vast labor of prepara-
tion, instead of utilizing some of the work done by others. I know a
German museum that practically prohibits the copying of labels for
use elsewhere. The English (regardless of the Manchester Museum)
and the Americans have already begun to publish some of their
printed labels.“

544 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The Manchester Museum of Owens College is among the leading
museums of England, and has apparently a great development before
it. In this insufficiently lighted Gothic building, however, it will
hardly develop fully. It is now an excellently arranged study collec-
tion, and in its present quarters can remain only such.

This museum also is open daily from 11 a. m. to 5 p.m. (to students
from 10 a. m. on) and on Sundays from 2.30 to 4,30 p.m., besides each
first Wednesday of the month from 7 to 9 p. m. when it is lighted by
electric are lights reflected from the ceiling. It is closed only on
Good Friday and on Christmas Eve.

While no attention has been paid in the Museum building to venti-
lation, a very notable method of ventilation has been installed in the
new physical laboratory of Owens College,“ by which no air is admitted
through the windows, but is brought in from the outside through
tubes over an oil bed, which clears it of dust. This may be well
thought out theoretically, but does not appear to hold good in prac-
tice, and, besides, the windows do not close tightly, so that air carry-
ing dust and soot comes in through the crevices. These windows are
also arranged for opening and are opened at times. The installation
is therefore imperfect. There is, however, always a thick crust of
dirt on the oil, the air passing through the tubes over it with force
before it enters the room. I shall revert later on to the question of
air cleansing.

23. PEEL PARK MUSEUM IN SALFORD.

Manchester is divided into two parts by the river Irwell, the west-
ern portion being called Salford, with its own separate incorporation.
High above a park is a good sized museum building in the Renaissance
style, ‘‘ for all,” and a library (Royal Museum and Libraries). This
was established in 1840 and was extended in 1853, 1857, and 1878.
The whole is so blackened and soiled with smoke that I was neces-
sarily most unfavorably impressed. There are a number of hand-
books for sale (Art, Mineralogy, Geology, 27 pp.; Fine Arts Sec-
tion: Marble Sculptures, Casts, Paintings, 32 pp.; Ethnography, 49
pp-) and a Popular Guide (8 pp.). Allis done with the best inten-
tions, but, owing to the lack of means, is of littleavail. It is much more
difficult in a manufacturing.and commercial city like Manchester than
elsewhere to impress the people in authority with the usefulness and
value of good museums, so that they will grant the necessary funds for
their maintenance.

WHITWORTH INSTITUTE.

The Whitworth Institute is a museum of art and industry in Whit-
worth Park. It contains a picture gallery, a commercial museum, and
the like. It is insufficiently lighted, but is not unattractive in its
interior decorations. In the basement, engravings, drawings, etc., are
exhibited with excellent results by means of Luxfer prism window
panes, the room being lighted by a single row of windows. I have
discussed this under New York (see p. 387), and have made an experi-
ment with them in the Dresden Ethnographic Museum. This arrange-
ment is also utilized to advantage in the Royal Armory in Berlin.

MUNICIPAL SCHOOL OF ARTS.
{Cavendish street. ]

The Municipal School of Arts, established in 1542, has a small but
very tastefully arranged art collection, brought together in 1898 in a
building erected by J. G. Sankey. The illumination from above is
not, however, satisfactory. There are 1,300 pupils.

CITY ART GALLERY AND MANCHESTER ART MUSEUM.

The City Art Gallery and the Manchester Art Museum, in Ancoats
(a1 suburb), I could not visit. The museum lends framed pictures to
elementary schools, generally in lots of 12 at a time, in every case for
a half year. It possesses over 3,000 pictures for this purpose and sup-
plies 92 schools, but is endeavoring to fill also the wants of the remain-
ing 215 elementary schools of Manchester. This museum, under the
direction of its founder, T. C. Horsfall, has a very far-reaching use-
fulness. (See also T. C. Horsfall: The Use of Pictures in Education.

The Manchester Technical School is a very large and high structure,
recently completed, of brick and terra cotta, with tasteful exterior,
the main entrance in gray granite, designed by Messrs. Spalding and
Cross, in free French renaissance style of the time of Francis I. It
was erected ata cost of $750,000, exclusive of the ground and furnish-
ing. The building was begun in 1895. There are 5,500 evening
pupils, 150 instructors, and 150 persons employed in other capacities.
As a building it is very noteworthy. Allof the rooms face the street,

and I note particularly the application of glazed bricks of a fine dark-
brown color (Burmantoff’s glazed bricks from the Leeds Fire Clay
Company Limited, in Leeds), which are also employed at the base of the
exterior of the building. In the English climate, which is mild as com-
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 547

pared with that of Germany, these glazed bricks stand exposure to
the weather, and I believe that they would also stand our more
vigorous winters, since they are likewise used quite extensively in
America, where the winters are even more severe than with us. On
the interior brighter, light-colored. glazed bricks are used, but for
economical reasons they do not extend the entire height of the
rooms and corridors, the upper portion being unglazed. The fire-
places are made of Burmantoff’s faience, supplied by the company
already mentioned. Colored glazed bricks are used in Manchester
and elsewhere in England to a considerable extent in monumental
structures; at all events, much more than with us. In many cases
exceedingly fine effects are thus obtained, as in Manchester, for
example, with the light-green and light-yellow brick from the Pilking-
ton Company, in the building of the Tootal Broadhurst Lee Company
(Limited), 56 Oxford street, and in some of the large new bank build-
ings in the neighborhood of the town hall (National Provincial Bank
of England, Merchantile-Bank of Lancashire, both in York street, the
latter furnished by the Malkin Company). I found these very attrac-
tive when of uniform color, and there are also some that are really
tasteful, in a simple manner ornamented with color. The technique of
glazed brick has certainly progressed well in England. It is well to
advise every architect who has a museum building to design to
examine into these things. I obtained two illustrated catalogues and
price lists from the following firms: The Malkin Tile Works Com-
pany (Limited), Patent Encaustic Tile Manufacturers, in Burslem,
Staffordshire, 62 Market street, Manchester; and Pilkington’s Tile
and Pottery Company (Limited), Clifton Junction, near Manchester,
37 Cross street, Manchester (these, in part, illustrated with some very
artistic prints from drawings by Walter Crane, M. Mucha, J. R.
Cooper, Lewis F. Day, John Chambers, C. F. A. Voysey, J.,H.
Rudd, and others). Another large factory is that of Doulton & Co.
(Limited), Lambeth, London. I believe these glazed bricks may be
very well utilized in the interior decoration of a museum. In collee-
tions, however, in which many objects must be hung on the walls,
wooden appliances are needed, which are easily made. In the tech-
nical school in Manchester very beautiful, not overdecorated colored
glass windows are also employed.

Of most decided importance is the method of ventilation employed
in the new building of the technical school in Manchester. It is the
same as referred to in my report on Chicago, see p. 484, and which
rests upon the principle that only screened (washed and cleaned)
air, permeated with steam and heated ad Uibitum, is brought into the
building (*tplenum system”). This building is one of the few in
_ Europe (some others will be mentioned in the course of this report) that
has introduced this important method, the only proper and necessary
548 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

one for museums, and I deem it of the utmost importance that only
this be employed in all new museum buildings. In the technical
school, moreover, all the windows can be opened without any unclean
air penetrating from the outside, since the pressure of the air
in the interior of the building is always greater than that from with-
out. I inspected the great shafts and ventilators (see fig. 88). It is
here applied in a very elaborate and expensive installation, such as is
required for sanitary purposes in a largely attended school, but it
is also to be recommended for museums and libraries for the same
purposes, and especially to preserve the collections from dust and
other damage. In such an exceptionally smoky city as Manchester
this installation is even of greater importance than elsewhere.

The new technical school is in the first rank in every respect. The
building cost the city $1,250,000. One of the highest American
authorities on this subject (Edward Atkinson, in Boston, of whose
labors I shall make mention in the continuation of my American
Studies) recently referred to it in the following words: ¢

I may add that I found in Manchester the most complete and well-devised build-
ing for technical instruction in science, including special departments for the textile
arts, that I have yet seen.

Before the construction of this school a commission inspected the
technical schools, institutions, and museums in Germany and Austria
and published a report in 1897, in which, among other things, the
following occurs (p. 16):

There are not elsewhere in the whole world such splendid collections as are to be
found in the British Museum and in South Kensington; but then you can hardly go
into a continental, and certainly not into a German, town, even of minor importance,
without finding a beautifully ordered and representative museum, suited to the needs
of the city and its neighborhood, and often not one merely, but another of a quite
special character should circumstances require it.

I believe, however, that in our German museums there is much
that is capable of improvement.

26. JOHN RYLANDS LIBRARY (DEANSGATE).

The John Rylands Library was donated to the city as a free library
by Mrs. Rylands in memory of her late husband, and opened in 1899.
Built of red sandstone in the Gothic style, in 1890, by B, Champneys,
it cost $1,500,000. It contains 70,000 volumes, valued at $1,250,000,
including? perhaps the best collection of incunabula in existence. It
is the valuable library purchased by Mrs. Rylands in 1892 from the
Count Spencer in Althorp, comprising the Althorp Library, together
with other treasures. The library has at its command for the pur-

chase of books the sum of $24,000 annually, and from this fund the
increase approximates 10,000 volumes yearly, but as the building is so
arranged that it can scarcely be extended, and as it is already filled,
they hardly know how to meet this difficulty.4

A more attractive building is hardly imaginable, nor one less suited
for a library, in which the readers must be supervised. Disregarding
all the experiences gained by libraries and all library principles, the
architect, following the wish of Mrs. Rylands, designed a magnificent
Gothic structure similar to the library of Mansfield College in Oxford.
The entrance hall is a perfect forest of columns, uncommonly attractive
artistically, but entirely useless, for the hall is so narrow and dark that
it must be artificially lighted in the daytime.’ ‘The entire building is in
the style of a church, and, imposing as it appears in its main nave (23
by 160 feet long, 50 feet high), in its side chapels, so to speak, or
alcoves, in its galleries and transepts, it is so dark that at 3 o’clock in
the afternoon in September electric lights had to be turned on through-
out. The books are not arranged in accordance with modern library
methods, as one might expect, but in cases, the same as has been done
from olden times, only the reference library being directly accessible
to the visitor. These cases, built of oak, with brass door frames and
plate glass, are delightful. They close perfectly and are dust proof as
long as the wood does not warp. Such an idealand magnificent arrange-
ment is certainly not to be found in many places; but, as I have already
remarked, the library is full, and, in view of the difficulty of adding to
this building, it will in the course of time be necessary to abandon this
elegant installation. The plate-glass doors of the cases are 10 feet high
and 2 feet wide, and in the grooves are rolls of velvet with an
inclosure of wool to make them dust proof. The librarian is of the
opinion that in consequence of the complete air-tight closing of the
cabinets, the majority of the costly books become moldy, and it is
therefore necessary for him to ventilate the cases by leaving the doors
open from time to time. I do not share his opinion’ and I believe,

«F. J. Burgoyne, Library Construction, Architecture, Fittings, and Furniture,
London, 1897, p. 128, says, in the chapter The Architectural History of the British
Museum Library: The history of all library architecture is pregnant with two
especial morals—the need of building from the first upon some well-considered plan,
so prepared as to admit of harmonious development in the future, and the necessity
of making extremely generous estimates in respect of space. Unless in the case of
libraries devoted to special classes of books, or of branch libraries controlled from
the parent institution, or of libraries where books no longer in general demand are
systematically sold off, space, unless the most effectual measures have been taken at
the very outset, must become the librarian’s master. The architectural history of
the British Museum is to a considerable extent a history of struggle against circum-
stances created by neglect of these elementary principles.

moreover, that the books mold because the building was occupied too
soon and is not yet dry. Everywhere, even in the small workroom
of the librarian, it smelled musty and gave the impression that the
building is damp. I at-

cases are so built in that
it is impossible to pro-

but at all events it is
important to definitely
decide whether books
are damaged in securely

occasion to inquire about
this in the Library Sainte

and the library is 50 years
old; furthermore, Paris
is not as moist as Man-
chester. In the museum
under my care we have
had books since 1897 in
air-tight iron cases, which
give not the least indica-
tion of damage up to the
present time. A number
of experienced librarians
whom I have asked, state as their opinion that a book is not damaged
by being kept in an air-tight case unless the book be a freshly bound
one, in which case it should be dried out for from one to two years
before it is stored in this manner; yet, in the John Rylands Library

STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 551

the very old bindings suffer in the same way. Books securely inclosed
will not be more lable to damage than the stuffed skins of animals,
and though the latter are thoroughly poisoned, this is not the case
with insect collections. At any rate, at the Dresden Museum, where
the insect collection is installed in air-tight iron cabinets, no injury
has been done to it up to this time.

Still more interesting than this subject is that of the ventilation.
The system installed is as in the technical school, so that only cleansed
air is introduced into the building. Here the windows are arranged
so that they can be opened; but too little pressure has been allowed for
the incoming or outgoing air, and in consequence the rooms are stuffy.
There appeared to be no remedy for this except to make casements or
valves in the windows to let the air in from outside, and consequently
the entire costly ventilating apparatus is rendered superfluous.“ This
difficulty could doubtless be remedied if the flues were altered, but
only with great difficulty, since all of the tubes and shafts are so buried
in the stone in the Gothic structure that it could not be accomplished
without greatly damaging the entire building. As a result the ven-
tilating arrangement was abandoned and unclean air is now admitted
from the outside into this ‘*jewel box,” so that it will soon be damaged
by smoke and soot, and the costly books with their precious old bind-
ings will suffer.

Hot-water heat is employed, and the air which is forced in is strained
through cotton. It is not, however, washed, though previously warmed
as it passed over the hot pipes. An electric-light system throughout
dispenses with the use of gas, which is so detrimental to books.

The building is fireproof, constructed entirely of stone, and almost
entirely vaulted. The floors have two fireproof layers with a space
between, though covered with oak wood. So much wood has been
introduced into the building itself, exclusive of the wooden cases, that
a fire starting on the inside and not immediately detected might lead
to the destruction of the valuable books. If the cases were of iron,
even though the excellent American library instal!ation should not be
adopted, and so much wood had not been utilized in the interior decora-
tions for the purpose of increasing the esthetic effect, this danger
would have been obviated. The location of the building in the center
of the city, closely surrounded by houses, makes the danger still greater.
The architect belonged to those who have foremost in their mind the
building itself and not its purposes and contents. How justice can be
done to the people and to the objects for which the building is designed,
that is another question.”

One of the special features, besides the collection of 2,000 rare block-
printed books and first impressions (nearly all antedating 1480), is that

“@See p. 484 under Chicago.

of the Bibles (said to be second only to the Bible collection of the Brit-
ish Museum). Further, the collection of Aldines (over 800) is under-
stood to be the most complete; and a collection of the earliest and
rarest books relating to America and the early explorations in general
should be mentioned. It is used very little as a purely scientific library
in the great commercial city, and mostly by clergymen. It 1s open
on week days from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesdays and Fridays also from
6G a.m. to 9 p. m., Saturdays only until 2 p. m., and is closed on Sun-
days and on ten week days during the year. A 3-volume printed
ratalogue (1899) and various printed section catalogues have appeared.
In England, as in America, organizations, societies, etc., are much
more privileged than with us in visiting public institutions and in
being shown through them. So it happened that on the day of my
visit a society of young men and women with religious tendencies
called or was invited on Saturday afternoon at 3 o’clock, at a time
when the library is ordinarily closed. Several hundred persons pre-
sented themselves. They assembled in the large, elegant, paneled lec-
ture room, and the director made an address in which he explained to
them something concerning the history and the contents of the library
and instructed them in the use of the books. All that he could say,
however, in this connection was that, since the library was a scientific
one, they would find help and encouragement for their religious
interests only in the large collection of Bibles, and he advised them
to use this section. The society was then permitted to wander at
will about the large library. The visitors were attended by the
director and other officials, and the noteworthy and valuable things
were pointed out. All parts of the building were well lighted with
electricity. This has assuredly the advantage of broadening the
horizon of a class of people who have no conception of such a magnifi-
cent installation as a good library, and of inspiring one or another of
them to go into the subject more profoundly.

27. FREE REFERENCE LIBRARY.

There were in Manchester also many other things to learn and to
report upon,” but my time was limited and the sojourn in this factory
town but little pleasing.

So I did not visit the Free Reference Library in King street,
which has been housed since 1878 in the old town hall (constructed
in 1823-1825), which contains 124,591 volumes, and in which during
the last year 360,176 readers have consulted 441,074 volumes. ‘The
city would long ago have undertaken the establishment of a new
up-to-date library, since everything is overcrowded, were it not for the
fact that a debt of $25,000,000 was assumed in the construction of the

ship canal between Manchester and Liverpool, besides large expendi-
tures for electric light and trams. F. J. Burgoyne?@ says:

It is strange that the town which was the first in Britain to obtain parliamentary
powers to establish a publie library should be content with a makeshift building as
a home for its splendid collection of books * * * Manchester has lagged behind

j* * *

This library has five branch reading rooms and distributes at thir-
teen places in the city books for reading at home.’ It has altogether
292,167 volumes, which were used in the aggregate during the last year
2,181,596 times, a daily average of 6,128. There were taken home
1,022,511 books by 46,456 persons provided with cards, and 657,121
in the boys’ rooms, five-sixths of whom were Sunday visitors. Since
the number of readers in the newspaper rooms aggregate 4,117,684, we
arrive at a total annual patronage of 6,138,996 persons. Even if we
omit the 4,000,000 newspaper readers, there still remains a formid-
able number, and the proper administration of all this is certainly a
remarkable performance. The annual expenditure by the city for the
library amounts to $108,000, of which $44,000 are allotted to salaries
and $25,000 for books and periodicals. We must not overlook the
fact that in the large number of books used as stated, of the 1,022,511
lent for home reading, 841,198 related to fiction, of which there are
62,915 volumes. In this respect all these libraries serve the same pur-
pose as our German private circulating libraries, except that with us
a fee must be paid, whereas with them the service is free of charge
(compare also with the above what I have said in connection
with the Chicago Public Library). In the Reference Library, on
the other hand, there is no fiction, but only books on theology,
philosophy (9,638 volumes), history, biography, travels (29,685),
politics and trade (21,503), arts and sciences (22,422), literature
(51,133), and patents (7,064). The consultation of 441,074 books by
360,176 readers in the last year is, as already stated, not only note-
worthy from a technical library standpoint, but it may also be taken
for granted that it has an influence on the education of the people of
the city. At any event, nowhere with us in Germany are so many
good books read by the people. The library has a printed catalogue
and publishes periodical lists of its acquisitions. The ‘* Manchester
Public Free Libraries” were established in 1852.¢ Of the other
libraries of Manchester may also be mentioned the Portico Library,
with 80,000 volumes (English literature, English topography, books of
the eighteenth century). All in all, the public libraries of Manchester
comprise 800,000 volumes.

IX.—EDINBURGH.

Edinburgh, a city with more than 300,000 inhabitants, is a paradise
in comparison with Manchester, but is itself more or less begrimed in
consequence of the location of the great railway station in the center
of the city. Were it not for this, Edinburgh, on account of its pictur-
esque location, would perhaps rival the finest cities of the world.
The town has only a few factories.

28. UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH.

The University of Edinburgh, with over 2,800 students and 170
instructors,” is located in a stately building erected at the close of the
eighteenth century. A dome has since been added (Plate 38). The

but the main hall makes a magnificent impression. All of the public
buildings of Edinburgh are conspicuous for their massiveness and
strength. In this respect the students’ clubhouse and the music school
in the group of the newer university buildings (fig. 90) are noteworthy,
and especially among these the Aula (McEwan Hall), which cost
$550,000, is one of the largest and finest buildings of the kind that I
know.’ The new university buildings are about ten minutes distant
from the old university, adjoining the school of medicine, opened
in 1844.

ANATOMICAL MUSEUM.

I could not inspect everything, and the Museum of Comparative
Anatomy, under Sir William Turner, possessed most that was to my
interest to visit. In 1720 Alexander Munro, then only 22 years old,
was professor of anatomy here; his son, Alexander Munro 2d, occupied
the same position for fifty years, and Munro 3d until 1846. He was
succeeded by John Goodsir, and the latter in 1867 by W. Turner, all
anatomists of world-wide reputation. The collection was founded by
Munro 2d, and is unusually valuable. Turner, with R. Rowland
Anderson, the architect of the entire School of Medicine, planned the
new museum in 1876. It was designed and executed after the pattern

Fic. 91.—University of Edinburgh, Anatomical Museum.

of the Royal College of Surgeons in London (see p. 528), and was com-
pleted in 1885. It cost $57,000, and, in addition, its interior installation
(cases, ete.), cost $42,000. It comprises a large hall, without columns,
provided with a skylight, and two galleries, one above the other (tig.
91), its interior dimensions being approximately 57 meters long, 13
wide, and 14 high. The stairs to the galleries, one flight at each end,
are narrow and steep, as in the Royal College of Surgeons in London;
they are used only by students, for the great public visits the museum
but little. The skylight consists of a horizontal layer of frosted glass
panes, and above this a glass roof with a grating along the middle and
inclined sides. The space between these two sets of windows is so
556 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

high that one can walk upright in it to clean the glass. The construc-
tion of this hall indicates in one respect an essential advance over the
halls of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, which as already
stated are too dark. Windows here are inserted on the ground floor,
so that the galleries do not shade the hall below, as in London. The
upper gallery has, besides, a floor of hammered glass. This scheme
of supplemental side lighting is very essential where there are
skylights, but is in no way to be preferred to the lighting of
large halls from two long sides, as it has many disadvantages. For
instance, the reflections of the skylight on the desk cases along the
rail of the galleries is very annoying, as is true everywhere in
similar structures (Hamburg, London, ete.). The cases on the
galleries are shallow wall cases, and those of the hall itself are
mostly free-standing ones, at right angles to the window piers. These
are consequently excellently lighted, while, on the contrary, the wall
cases on the narrow sides of the hall are dark. Though the superb
mahogany cases, with plate glass, are on the whole very impressive
when one enters the large hall, they do not, with their massive
framework, answer to strict modern requirements. Furthermore,
they do not close tightly, and the collection, therefore, must be cleaned
yearly throughout. There are horizontal cases near the windows.
The shelves in the cases are of plate glass or of iron lattice-work,
which is less attractive. The museum contains on the main floor
comparative-anatomy preparations. The upper gallery is devoted to
pathology, as in the Royal College of Surgeons in London. Doors
lead from the galleries into the several departments of the medical
school. The floor of the hall is on. the level with the adjoining labo-
ratories, preparators’ quarters, the dissecting room, and lecture hall.
Everything is excellent and spacious. The ample space between the
cases, from the floor to the roof, is occupied by a rich collection of
whale skeletons, making a striking picture. They are suspended by
chains, which appear less massive than the iron rods employed in the
Royal College of Surgeons in London.

At one end of the great hall there is a room about 23 feet long, 16
feet broad, and 20 feet high, with a gallery for the excellent series of
racial skulls; among them, for example, over 70 Australian skulls.
This collection rivals in importance that of the Royal College of Sur-
geons in London. There is also an old phrenological collection, phre-
nology having been zealously cultivated in Edinburghat the time of Gall.

In general, this museum, on account of the limited force of em-
ployees, as occurs in many English museums, is not sufficiently cared
for or labeled. It ranks, however, among the best in the world, and
Sir William Turner has made a worthy monument for himself.“

« Recently (1903) Sir William Turner has been elected principal of the University,
and Prof. D. J. Cunningham of Dublin has become his successor.

29. MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND ART.

The Museum of Science and Art (since 1904 the Royal Scottish
Museum), which from its size and variety might properly have been
mentioned before the Anatomical Museum, is an old one. It was
founded toward the close of the seventeenth century, when the
renowned naturalists, Andrew Balfour and Robert Sibbald, laid its
foundation. Sibbald printed, as early as 1697, a catalogue of the col-
lection of minerals, stones, metals, vegetable products, animals, art
objects, manuscripts, and books. In 1854 the present location was
purchased for $35,000. In 1861 the new, stately building was begun
after plans by Fowke. In 1866 the first portion, in 1875 the second
portion, and in 1888 the last portion, was completed. It is the National
Museum of Scotland, is supported by the state (Scottish Education
Department), and is free of access to the university professors for

purposes of instruction. The building immediately adjoins the new
university, and opposite stands Heriot-Watt College, an institute for
instruction in technology, natural science, and art. Now (since 1900)
F. Grant Ogilvie is the director of the whole,? and R. H. Traquair
(since 1873) the curator of the natural science department. There are
30 officials on its roster. In the manner of the South Kensington
Museum, in London, it combines art, industry, and technology, and in
addition, the entire natural sciences, making a grand whole. It is
divided into the following departments:

1. Decorative art: Specimens of ancient, classic, medieval, and
renaissance sculptures, especially as applied to architecture; the indus-

collections, Persian and Indian collections, Chinese and Japanese col-
lections, ancient Egyptian and Chaldean arts, furniture and decora-
tive woodwork, casts of architectural ornament.

2. Technology: Min-

The museum is free on five days of the week from 10 a. m. to 4
p- m., Saturdays from 10 a. m to 10 p. m., Wednesdays also from 6 to
10 p. m., Sundays from 2 to 5 p. m., on which account a large portion

of the collection must nat-
urally suffer. The build-
ing consists of a spacious
hall with skylight and two
galleries—one above the
other (figs. 95 and 96) and
with ten large adjoining
rooms partially supplied
with skylights and galler-
ies. It measures in ex-

of similar buildings. The

cases are of wood with clumsy framework, and are black. To make
them dust proof, velvet strips have been placed between the frames
and the doors, but without grooves, and then the doors are screwed on
to the outer framework; besides being locked up at several places.

STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 559
To open them, one must get a ladder, and then with a screw-driver
unscrew them in several places. No attention is paid to this incon-
venience, however, since they are not accustomed to anything better,
and they even regard this method of installation as an advance on that
of other museums, since
it prevents the warping
of the wooden framework
and makes the cases dust
proof, which it evidently
does when the frames are
screwed on. Notwith-
standing all this, the cases
and doors are quite small.
Three hundred and _ fifty
running feet of such cases
were completed and _ in-
stalled in 1899 alone.

The labeling of the De-
partment of Art and In-
dustry is after the pattern
of that of the South Kensington Museum. In the great Natural His-
tory Department, which is by no means insignificant and which fills
four great skylighted halls and six galleries (3 series of two galleries,
one above the other), I did not notice any features deviating from the
customary ones. Through-
out the museum there is
by far too much exhibited
for the great public, and,
in consequence, this not
only tires the visitor, but
the exhibits are damaged
seriously by being con-
stantly exposed to the
light. This matter is sufli-
ciently considered in but
few museums of the world.

nothing that was directly worth imitating or particularly useful in

planning for a new structure. The ventilation was primitive and the
building was not adequately fireproof.

bronzes, too, are represented. The order and labeling was not satis-
factory, but a new installation was just going on.

The museum contains also loan collections from the South Kensing-
ton Museum in London. It was visited in 1901 by 875,179 persons,
half of whom attended during the evening.“ The opening of the
museum on Sundays begun only with April 1, 1901, and, on account
of its departure from custom, aroused much opposition; but Sunday
opening has since been introduced in Glasgow. The average attend-
ance on Sundays up to the present time has been 1,297 persons? (in
London, 8,500; in Dublin, 5,000, in the corresponding museums). In
1897-98 the annual expenditure exceeded $75,000.

30. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES.

The National Museum of Antiquities was founded in 1780 and has
belonged to the nation since 1851. The new building, by R. Rowland
Anderson, costing $250,000 and very notable and attractive in its
exterior, was completed in 1890 and was a gift from John Ritchie
Findlay. It is in the comparatively broad Queen street, in close prox-
imity to other houses. It is built in the Gothic style, not adapted for
housing collections, and in parts is insufliciently lighted. The director,
Dr. Joseph Anderson, himself regrets this, as well as the many other
defects of the building. I mention it only for the purpose of eall-
ing attention to the fact that museum buildings are almost universally
badly planned, because the architects do not seek, as they should, the
advice of experts. Unfortunately there are but few experts in such
matters.

The building is of brick, ‘wage is treated on the interior somewhat
too roughly to be attractive. Light is obtained from both long sides,
but the Gothic windows admit too little. It is fireproof; without
proper ventilation; and heated by steam. The collection of antiquities
occupies the right wing of the building; the left contains the national
portrait gallery and a collection of casts and other objects relating
to art. The center of the building is occupied by a large entrance
hall (with paintings), which takes up much room. The Museum of
Antiquities consists of a very comprehensive, valuable, and attractive
prehistoric and historic local (Scotch) collection, excellently arranged
in chronological order. The upright and horizontal cases are primi-
tive. The interior furniture cost $20,000. There is a considerable
library in a hall, lighted from above; also a small ethnographic collec-
tion, with valuable objects from the South Seas, some of which are old.
The building is cig daily from 10 to 4; on two days of the week

there is an admission fee of six pence; it is closed-on Mondays. The
number of visitors yearly is about 20,000. A most excellent hand-
book is the catalogue of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scot-
land, 1892 (1 shilling), 380 pages, 752 illustrations. An annual report
is published in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquities of
Scotland. The museum has not sufficient means at its disposal.

Fic. 97.—National Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh, Scotland.

31. VARIOUS OTHER MUSEUMS.

I mention, in addition, the National Gallery, with a considerable col-
lection of paintings, poorly lighted from above; the Royal Institution,
with a collection of casts; the City Museum; the Fine Art Museum, in
the university; and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.
These establishments, excepting the first named, I omitted to visit, for
I was told that they were not important and, moreover, other sights
of interest in Edinburgh completely occupied my time. I beg to
mention in closing, however, the magnificent Botanical Garden, with
its splendid conservatories, containing, among other things, a col-
lection of pitcher-plants (Nepenthacee), of surprising beauty and
abundance.

The administration of the Edinburgh museums will undoubtedly
receive a great impulse from the gift of Andrew Carnegie (born in
Scotland in 1837 and emigrated in 1848, with his family, to America),
who donated $10,000,000 to the Scotch universities (as a first install-
ment) for the ‘‘advancement of education,” a portion of which dona-

tion may be devoted to the promotion of scientific research through
the establishment and equipment of museums.

X.—_GLASGOW.

Glasgow is a seaport and manufacturing city, with upward of
1,000,000 inhabitants. Its street life is imposing; it is not so begrimed
as Manchester, but still it is smoky to a very considerable extent. In
Kelvingrove Park stands the great university building erected in 1870,
by G. G. Scott, at a cost of $2,500,000 (the university was founded in
1451), in the early English style with later Scotch-Flemish features.
The building is 590 feet long and 321 feet wide, with a tower 328
feet high., The library contains 180,000 volumes, and there are 2,500
students and 60 instructors. The annual expenditure for the univer-
sity is $300,000. Inasmuch as I was informed that its collections are
not very noteworthy, I did not inspect them, especially since the
international exhibition in the same park fully occupied my time.
My chief interest lay in the entirely new Museum of Art and Science,
opened in 1901, and temporarily occupied by parts of the exhibition.

32. CORPORATION MUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES. ?

During the exhibition the building contained mostly loan collections,
but at its close the not unimportant gallery of paintings, the Corpora-
tion Art Industrial Museum, and the Natural History Museum were
installed there.“ This natural-history collection at the time of my

factory; then he became fireman in a factory; then telegraph messenger; in his fif-
teenth year a telegraph operator, with a salary of $25.a month. At the age of 20 he
became secretary to the director of a large railway; at 25, a superintendent of mili-
tary telegraphy of the Federal Government; at 28, the owner of an oil well; at 30,
a builder of iron bridges; at 45, the ‘‘steel king.’’ It is said that he possesses a for-

to die ‘‘poor.’’? Hespends his summer in Skibo, Scotland. (See further mention of
Mr. Carnegie and his gifts on previous pages.)

Tt is noticed that it is intended to change the name to Art Palace. We also find
it styled in various ways—as, Corporation Art Gallery and Museums, New Art Gal-
leries and Museum, Corporation of Glasgow, Museums and Art Galleries, Glasgow
Art Gallery and Museum (Kelyingrove), Corporation Galleries, ete. The former
Kelvingrove Museum had the following divisions: Fine-art section, ethnographical
section, archeological section, technological section, local-history section, natural-
history section, and book section.

¢T have indicated on the plan of the ground floor (fig. 98) the present distribu-
tion of the collections. In the second story there are only paintings and art objects
(see The Museums Journal, 1, 1902, p. 317). The director expresses his regret (on
page 324) that the natural sciences are not properly cared for, the very limited
space affording no opportunity for a strictly systematic arrangement and being cut
up too much. It is certainly unfortunate that in an entirely new building these
difficulties must already be encountered.

The new building (Plate 39), by J. W. Simpson and E. I. M.
Allen (of London), begun in 1893, is decidedly cumbrous” though
effective in its exterior. In the interior it is also richly decorated,
but not too much for its purpose. It is of red sandstone in the
French Renaissance style, and is fireproof. The chief artistic decora-
tion is by G. Frampton. Sir Walter Armstrong, director of the
National Gallery in Dublin, sharply criticised’ the selection of red sand-
stone instead of white, since the red stone, on account of the smoki-
ness of Glasgow, will soon become completely black. The architect
of the John Rylands Library in Manchester (see p. 548), on the con-
trary, maintains that the red sandstone withstands the effects of the
smoke better than the white stone. I believe that the difference, if
any, is scarcely perceptible. It would bea blessing if all of these cities
were less smoky. The building is approximately 492 feet long and 164
to 278 feet wide. It hasa stately main hall with galleries 137 feet long,
62 feet wide, and 88 feet high, of cream-colored sandstone; and two
lateral halls with skylight and galleries 110 by 65 feet. The six lateral
and intersecting halls of the ground floor are lighted from the side;
the six of the second story from skylights. They are (approximately)
110 feet long and 30 feet wide; those of the second story occupied by
the art gallery, in the opinion of Sir Walter Armstrong (see above),
are too low. There are four corner pavilions in each story, the upper
ones with skylights, making the ground plan quite diversified. Six
stairways lead to the second story. Above the southern front hal!
there is another large hall in the third story. The lighting arrange-
ments are good, with brilliant electric illumination in the evenings.
The many towers, some of which are 186 feet high, are useless, and
constitute a very questionable ornamentation to the building, since it
lacks repose. The proceeds of the Glasgow Exhibition of 1888 (nearly
$250,000) was the basis of the funds from which the cost of the build-
ing was defrayed. To this were added voluntary donations (almost
$375,000), and. this sum not being deemed sufficient, the city under-
took the construction of the building, which cost over $1,250,000.
The proceeds of the Exhibition of 1901 ($500, 000) will be devoted to
the purchase of pictures.

I would have little reason to dwell longer on this new museum,
which is only a more or less slight departure from the usual pattern,°

a Plate 39 was taken during the Exposition, for which reason we see various kiosks,
pavilions, etc., which do not belong to it.

» Scots Pictorial, June 15, 1901, p. 181.

¢Sir Walter Armstrong characterizes the ground floor of the building ‘‘more sue-
cessful than anything else of the same kind in Europe.’”’ I grant that it is magnifi-
cent, but I doubt if it deserves so great a commendation. He remarks at: the close
of his paper: The Glasgow Gallery is incontestably the finest in Europe outside the
great capitals, and the director, J. Paton (the Museums Journal, January, 1902,
p- 315), goes so far as to say: Gitea can boast of having the most handsome and
architecturally ornate museum building of any provincial town in the United King-
dom if not in the whole world.

were it not for the fact that it has one arrangement which in museum
buildings marks an advance of the greatest importance, namely, that
for ventilation. It is like that described above in the technical school
and the Rylands Library in Manchester, and which I also observed in

been applied within my knowledge for museum purposes, at the same
time as we shall see with that of the museum in Liverpool. I mark,
with the erection of this building, a new epoch in the history of

that we have found a means
to obviate this, this means
should be employed. The in-
stallation of ventilating sys-
tems in Glasgow is on a large
scale and I had an opportu-
nity to witness its satisfactory
operation. It isa serious ques-
tion in this connection whether
it is necessary to keep the win-
dows completely secured, so
that they can not be opened,
as they are here, or whether
such an arrangement should
be adopted as in the technical
school in Manchester, which
permits of their being opened,
under the condition, however,
that the pressure of the air on
the inside is always greater
than that from without. This
is an indispensable prerequi-
site. This question is impor-
tant since the cleaning of se-
curely closed windows from
the outside presents great diffi-
culties. In the Congressional
Library in Washington very
light, exterior iron galleries
are employed, from which the
windows may be cleaned. An-
other, though more expensive,
arrangement would consist in
letting the windows revolve
about a vertical central axis
and screw the frames on so

that they are with not too great difficulty accessible for cleaning from
the inside. I believe this latter method is the better, for I fear that
it would be hard to maintain at all times a higher pressure of air

inside than outside.

In the art school of Glasgow this method of ventilation has also

been installed with securely closed windows. It will, however, be
discarded, since in modeling so much dust is stirred up inside that
it is thought that the dust from without could not be objectionable.

33. TECHNICAL COLLEGE; MITCHELL LIBRARY.

The great city of Glasgow, which enjoys the best government of
any of the cities of the Island Kingdom, would certainly, on closer
study, have offered many other things worthy of examination in rela-
tion to museum matters, but my time was too limited.

I shall mention, in addition, the Glasgow and West of Scotland
Technical College, founded in 1886, with an annual expenditure of
$100,000, 600 day and 4,000 evening pupils, 67 instructors, and a
library of 15,000 volumes; also the Mitchell Library, established in
1877, with an endowment of $350,000 by Stephen Mitchell, an annual
expenditure of $16,500, and 145,000 volumes. There are probably
500,000 volumes annually consulted, for the library allows no books to
be carried away. The daily attendance is approximately 2,000. To
prevent a conflagration from flying sparks tubes are laid upon the
roof with small apertures through which, upon the opening of a cock
in the cellar, sufficient water flows to extinguish any fire. This is an
arrangement very worthy of imitation. (See, concerning this excel-
lent library, J. J. Ogle, The Free Library, 1897, pp. 288-293; and
F. J. Burgoyne, Library Construction, 1897, pp. 162-166.)

XI.—LIVERPOOL.

Liverpool is a seaport and manufacturing town of nearly 700,000
inhabitants; somewhat hilly, and notas highly smoked up as Manchester,
but also black. For this reason the good effect of the very impressive
principal square is injured. It is similar to the forum of a Roman
city, with St. George’s Hall, a building like a Greco-Roman temple,
650 feet long and 200 feet wide, for public assemblages, concerts, etc.,
built in 1838-1854, at a cost of $1,500,000; a row of monuments, and
a long, extending group of museum buildings in the Greek style.
Outside of these Liverpool possesses very little of value for my pur-
poses. It has a university college, which is a portion of Victoria
University, as mentioned previously (see paragraph on Owens College,
in Manchester), with from 500 to 600 students and over L00 instructors.
There is also an observatory.

Glasgow, November 24, 1903: I am glad to say the heating and ventilation is giving
very good results and I do not think one can at present get a better or cheaper
system to do the work required. One alteration I have made is that in place of
washing the air at the screens I have put up scrim screens and filter the air through
the cloth and so do away with the water, which was causing dampness in the buildings
and doing harm to the old paintings and other objects. When one considers that
our large buildings can be kept at about 60° in the winter months by a daily supply
of 7 tons of washed pearls ‘screened dross,’ costing at present 7s. 1d. per ton, you
will see that the system used is cheap as well as efficient. I may say the floor space
of our building is as follows: Picture galleries, 21,450 square feet; museum galleries,
21,336 square feet; central hall, courts, and corridors, which are marble, 45,000 square
feet; grand total of floor space, 87,786 square feet.
570 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

34. LIBRARY, MUSEUM, AND ART COMMITTEE.

The collection of buildings of the museums of art and science are
maintained by the city at an expense of $200,000 and are administered
under the ‘* Library, museum, and art committee.” They comprise
the following departments: (1) An art museum (Walker Fine Art Gal-
lery), built in 1877, on the ground floor of which are plastic reproduc-
tions, on the second floor paintings, excellently lighted and pleasantly set
off by tapestries and plants, so that a sojourn there is highly agreeable.
(2) A library (Picton Reading Room) of 122,000 volumes exclusive of
pamphlets, a reference library, principally contained in a great round
building. (3) The main structure, called the ‘‘ Free Public Library
and Museums,” a library of 95,000 volumes, with five branches in the
city, for lending books, with reading and periodical rooms into which
people pour from the streets, “and a museum of natural science, arche-
ology, ethnography, industrial arts, and art (independent of those
branches of art which the Walker Fine Art Gallery cultivates), known
as the ‘* Free Public Museums.” In the lower stories of this museum
building is located the new technical school.

35. FREE PUBLIC MUSEUMS.

The Free Public Museums are open on five week days from 10a. m.
to 4 or 6 p. m., and in the winter, on Monday evenings, from 7 to 10
p-m. In 1899, on 262 days, there were over 300,000 visitors; in 1898,

ments are not modern. Their sphere of action, however, is great. The totals for
1900 are as follows: 666,207 books and 728,128 periodicals were read in the library;
612,386 persons visited the newspaper rooms, and 58,929 the 116 publie lectures;
819,317 books were carried home by 22,244 persons (‘‘for the most part they belong
to the working classes, and to persons of education but of very limited means’’), of
which, however, 643,842 were fiction and 132,535 were children’s books. Although
I particularly mention the fiction included in this total, I do not wish to depreciate
the value of such books, for after the day’s work thereare few recreations so refreshing,
delightful, and even instructive to the thoughtful reader as is fiction, while we should
not overlook the fact also that the publie libraries do not purchase any bad novels.
In the Picton Reading Room alone, where no fiction is given out, 246,533 books were
read, of which there were, for example, 41,863 technical, 49,748 collected writings,
essays, etc., and 22,145 historical and biographical. The library possesses 15,913 tech-
nical, 29,042 collected writings, essays, ete., 14,595 historical and biographical works.
(Forty-eighth Annual Keport Public Libraries, ete., Liverpool, 1901, pp. 5-31; see also
J. J. Ogle, The Free Library, 1897, pp. 165-173, and F. J. Burgoyne, Library Construc-
tion, 1897, pp. 167-170.) It is open on week days from 10 a. m. to 10 p. m. (Fridays
from 10 a. m. to 2. p.m.). The annual expenditures are $100,000, half of which is
expended for books, periodicals, and newspapers. About 80 persons are employed.
The reference department has a catalogue in three volumes in quarto, 2,066 pages.
In Germany we are very backward in this respect, though we far excel the English
in the busy life at our hedge taverns.

ings, from January to March in 1900, there were 760 auditors, in 1899
at 21 lectures, 2,470. The museum consists of two great collections:
The Derby Museum of Zoology, Botany, Geology, Mineralogy (also
an aquarium), which has as its nucleus the mammal and bird collec-
tion of the thirteenth Earl of Derby, who presented it to the city
in 1851; and the Mayer Museum, covering the other departments
mentioned. Joseph Mayer was a rich goldsmith of Liverpool, who
in 1867 presented to the city his most valuable collection, consisting
especially of pottery, Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, and
medieval antiquities and manuscripts. I mention as most noteworthy
the carved ivories, the collection of Anglo-Saxon antiquities, the
Mexican Codex,” the miniatures, and the great Wedgwood and old

the present building to the city. At the end of 1897, the space having
become too limited, a great wing was added (fig. 108), containing two
floors (figs. 106 and 107), each with a single connecting room 36
feet wide, undivided, horseshoe-shaped, 460 feet long, surrounding
a courtyard. The lower floor, 20 feet high, is lighted on both sides;
the upper, 30 feet high, with a skylight. As fig. 103 shows, the land

the Natural History Museum is the third of the building, since the
three below that (the basement, ground floor, and second floor)
belong to the new Technical School, which is entirely separated
from it and has its own entrance. ‘The lower floor of the Natural
History Museum (the third in the new wing) is, however, on a level
with the ground floor of the old museum, with which it makes
a complete whole (fig. 103). The height of the new wing is 100 feet
above the street level. It is hard stone, constructed by E. W. Mount-
ford, in the ‘* modern classic style of the nineteenth century;” it is 206
feet long and 177 feet wide, and has an area of 3,000 square yards.
Between the seven windows of the lower museum story on the rounded
portion are pairs of Ionic columns 33 feet high. Also, high up above
the upper story of the museum are additional rooms for the Technical
School, namely, a chemical laboratory and an observatory. The
school has 1,300 students. The entire new building cost $675,000, of
which $375,000 falls upon the museum. The new large rooms are com-
pleted (figs. 106 and 107), and, being excellently lighted and spacious,
the museum will, next to that of London, be the most comprehensive,
and in all respects one of the best in Great Britain. The lighting of
the gallery on both sides, 36 feet wide, is faultless, and the only method
suitable for a natural-history museum, since in that way wall cases
placed opposite the light are avoided. The upper story could not be
lighted in this manner, but it was necessary to depend upon a skylight,
as the new wing had to correspond constructively with the exterior of
the old museum. Here, likewise, the adaptability of the interior
has been subordinated to exterior beauty. The skylight is not by any
means bad, though side light would have been better. Besides, the
handling of a large skylight is somewhat inconvenient, and it can

“Jn the Report of the Director of Museums relative to the Rearrangements of, and
the Cases for, the Collections in the Free Public Museums (Liverpool, 1901, 8 vo.,
16 pp.), Prof. H. O. Forbes developes the fundamental features of his plan of instal-
lation. The future collections will consist of: I. The Aquarium; II. The Mayer
Museum, that is subdivided into three great ethnographical divisions, in the Cauca-
sian (white), the Mongolian (yellow), and the Melanic (black) races; III. The Lord
Derby Museum, the latter being subdivided as follows: Types of the Principal Groups
and Subdivisions of the Animal Kingdom, from mankind down to unicellular forms.
This biological collection begins with an introductory series of animals, plants, models,
and drawings, illustrating the distinction between inorganic and organic objects,
between plants and animals, as well as the general formation and the physiology
of animals. Associated with the living forms will be the fossil ones, so that by study-
ing them together the development from the first to the last may be observed. Then
will follow the mineralogical and the geological collections. Beyond this a represen-
tation of the geographic distribution of animals and plants, as well as of protective
mimicry, variation of species, and other fundamental principles of biology. Finally,
a collection of objects by countries not confined to too narrow geographical boun-
daries, but including the adjacent waters, will aim to be practically complete.
Botany will be put in advance of everything else in a British collection, but typical
examples of all natural orders wili also be given.

sists of are lights reflected from the ceilings, of which a test was being
made at the very time of my visit. It resulted successfully, even in
the skylight floor. The iron cases for the collection will soon be com-
pleted. There is allotted for the interior furnishing $125,000 (the
interior arrangements of the Technical School cost $75,000).

Fic. 104.—Free Public Museums, Liverpool, England. Plan of lower floor.

The present portion of the old Museum must be less favorably
spoken of. The rooms are too dark; one witha skylight and galleries
suffers much from reflections on the broad desk cases arranged along
the rail. The vertical and horizontal cases are some of them very
clumsy. I observed, however, a good arrangement upon horizontal
cases, namely, a brass mounting on the anterior framework, on which
the observer can lean while examining the objects in the case. The

is also overcrowded, but contains much valuable material. The new
installation of the entire Museum will work great changes in this
respect. This Museum suffers, like others, from a lack of. a suffi-
cient corps Of assistants. The newly installed anthropological hall is

objects. It contains, for example, life-size photographs of the heads
of different races, enlarged from smaller negatives. The ethnographic
collection, now temporarily installed in the basement is very consid-
erable, containing many old specimens and also a good representa-
tion of Benin bronzes. The noted ornithological collection is rich in
types, and contains among other things the famous collection of the
ornithologist, H. B. Tristram.

The principal reason why I dwell longer on this Museum, though its
importance is of the future rather than of the present, is because in
one respect, together with that of Glasgow, it excels all other museums
of the earth, and that is as regards the new ventilating and heating

installation. When the large new wing for the technical school and
the museum was designed, not only that, but also the old museum,
the library, and the art gallery, were supplied with the ventilating
and heating contrivance described in connection with the Glasgow
Museum. Engineer W. Key, of Glasgow, superintended the installa-
tion of this in Liverpool. There are four and a third miles of 3-inch
tubes, which carry purified and warmed air into each room at the rate
of 8,000,000 cubic feet an hour. The ducts through which the puri-
fied, washed, and warmed air streanis into the tubes, are so large that
one can easily walk in them. The power is supplied by great dynamo
machines. The future must demonstrate whether, being located in

the same building, these will not damage it by causing vibration.
This has very generally been avoided in America. Iam not favorably
disposed to the combining of a technical school and its many laboratories
in the same building with a museum. The windows of the building
can not be opened, and the collection has the rare advantage in that
no dust is brought in with the air to damage them; neither does any
come in through the doors, since the pressure of air on the interior is
somewhat greater than that from without. This system of ventilation
is known as Key’s improved plenum method. It was a surprise to me
that the authorities in the Liverpool, as well as in the Glasgow
Museum, did not know that this same installation existed in the other

museum. I repeat that the two museums of Great Britain which I
have mentioned excel in this respect all museums of the world, and I
earnestly recommend that we adopt this arrangement and do not
remain in the background. The Liverpool Museum appears to have
reached this in connection with the construction of the technical
school, while that of the museum in Glasgow was carried out inde-
pendently.

I notice in a printed letter of the firm of William Key (works for
ventilating and warming by mechanical means, Havelock street, Glas-
gow) that such installations have already been introduced into a great
number of schools, hospitals, factories, hotels, private dwellings,

installed in the university and the public library in Aberdeen. The
Key list enumerates more than 80 buildings. Great Britain has prob-
ably outrivaled America in this respect, at least I found this installa-
tion only in two large buildings in Chicago (see the second part of my
American studies) and in one in Washington. In the pamphlet pub-
lished in connection with the opening of the New Central Municipal
School in Liverpool on October 26, 1901,¢ the ventilating and heat-
ing arrangements are referred to as follows:

The air in the building is kept under a pressure slightly greater than that of the
outside atmosphere. The air is taken in from the large area at the back of
the building, and after being washed and _ filtered by passing through wet
fiber screens, and warmed when necessary by means of a large surface of coils of
pipes heated by steam, it is propelled by four large fans into the main ducts in the
subbasement and then by subsidiary ducts to each room in the building. The air is
admitted to the rooms at a height of about 6 feet from the floor, and escapes at the
floor level into the foul air ducts which lead to the outside through apertures pro-
tected by valves. (The electric power is supplied by the city works).?

From 1877 to 1891, the museum published, at irregular intervals,
five Museum Reports relating to scientific subjects; since 1898 a
Bulletin of the Liverpool Museums, in octavo, with plates,—a well-
edited publication, of which three volumes have appeared; in addition,
Annual Reports, of which the forty-eighth, for 1900, has been pub-
lished (87 pp.); guide books, such as Synopsis of an arrangement
of invertebrate animals in the Free Public Museum of Liverpool,
1880 (82 and 105 pp.); catalogues, such as Catalogue of the Mayer
collection: Part I, The Egyptian, Babylonian, and Assyrian Antiqui-
ties, 1879, ix, 83 pp., with illustrations; Part II, Prehistoric Antiqui-.
ties and Ethnology, 1882, xiv, 106 pp., with illustrations; Part ILL,

@Sir William Forwood, chairman of the ‘‘ Library, Museum and Arts Committee”’
of the city council, on the occasion of the laying of the corner stone on July 1, 1898,
said among other things: ‘‘This building is intended for the higher technical educa-
tion—for educating the captains of labor, and not merely the artisans, in a way that
would enable them to meet the competition of Germany. The Germans have had
these superior schools for years, and have been turning out a large number of expert
and scientific men such as did not exist in England.’’ As in the great Technical
School in Manchester, so also in Liverpool, they are striving to compete with Ger-
many in technical matters.

bT inquired recently as to the efficiency of the heating and ventilation after two
years experience, and Mr. Forbes, the director, favored me with the following reply,
dated Liverpool Novy. 28, 1903: ‘‘In regard to the heating and ventilating system
of the museums I am sorry to report not quite favorably. This, however, is not the
fault of the system of Key, which, by the way, has been further perfected, but by
reason of the intake aperture for the fresh air having of necessity, and unfortunately,
to be placed in a ‘well’ (surrounded by walls 70 to 80 feet high), with which the air
from the galleries is discharged and necessarily so constantly being redriven into
the Museum. We are thinking of changing the ‘intake’ openings—a costly pro-
cedure—and when this is done, I believe all we can desire would be attained.”’

one in 1898, which went to Socotra.

The annual expenditure is $52,000. The officers are: Director,
H. O. Forbes; curators of the Derby Museum, J. A. Clubb and W. 5S.
Laverock; and curator of the Mayer Museum, P. Entwistle.

XII._DUBLIN.

Dublin is a seaport with about 250,000 inhabitants, without factories,
and consequently reasonably clean, though not free from soot.

36. SCIENCE AND ART MUSEUM.

The Science and Art Museum comprises, with the National Library
(fig. 108), a large, imposing, and beautiful group of buildings, inclosing
on three sides a courtyard, which is fenced by a grill in front. The
central building, the Leinster House (the former castle of the Duke of
Leinster), is occupied by the Royal Dublin Society. Here are also
located the administrative offices of the museum. On one side of this
is situated the museum and on the other the library (fig. 108), both
erected nearly alike by T. N. Deane & Sons and opened in 1890. The
natural history department has a wing to itself (fig. 109). In the rear
is an extensive park, in which, near the library, stands the National
Gallery.

The Science and Art Museum is open weekdays, admission free,
from 11 a. m. till 5 p. m. and closed only on Good Friday and Christ-
mas Eve. On Tuesdays the department of art and industry, and on
Thursdays the natural science department, are open until 10 o’clock
in the evening. The former is open on Sundays from 2 to 5 p. m.
The number of visitors in 1900 was 425,884, of which 64,165 came on
Sunday afternoons.

This museum, like the one of the same name in Edinburgh, is copied
more or less after the South Kensington Museum, with the addition
of a natural science collection. This uniformity of the museums in
the Island Kingdom corresponds to the uniformity of life there, which
in Germany and France is much more varied. It is often said that

individual freedom of development is greater in the English than in
the German, but this appears to me to be very questionable.

The interior of the museum building does not altogether harmonize
with the beautiful and impressive exterior. There is a central, large
lighted court with two galleries, one above the other in the sil of
a railway station, overdecorated, checkered,.and somewhat wanting in
good taste, even in the eyes of the officials themselves (it is called
there the ‘‘German” taste; that is, like the cheap, inferior wares that
were formerly imported); adjoining is a great series of rooms, of
which some are very dark, especially the one containing the ethno-
graphic collection. The poor lighting could be much improved by
the Luxfer prism glass, but this scheme has been adopted as yet to
very limited extent by the museums of the Island Kingdom.

The zoological collection, too, has a large hall, lighted from above,
with two galleries superposed (fig. 110), but the lig hting facilities are
Seeman meager, the cases and desks primitive, aul the installation

not very elegant. I mention especially a Shakespeare case, with birds
trained for hunting, falcons, and the like, together with passages from
the works of the poet. Very noteworthy is the representation of the
geographical distribution of animals in seven sections; distribution in
general and six geographical regions. I know only one museum in
the world where the same thing is attempted, namely, the Museum of
Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which I hope to
describe in a future report. In Dublin this exhibition is not developed
very extensively, but it is highly commendable. The great museums of
the world (London, Paris, Berlin, New York, etc.) have nothing similar
to this, yet they only are in a position fully to carry out such a scheme.
The systematic exhibit must necessarily be supplemented by a geo-
graphic one. It is a matter of satisfaction that at least one European
museum, too, has undertaken this important task, even though ona
small scale.“ Very noteworthy also, ee as I believe ee is the

exhibition in the ‘‘ History of Animals Collection.” It represents the
history or the origin of species, classification, variation, natural selec-
tion, instinct, development, ete.

A conspicuous feature of the large collections is the one represent-
ing Irish archeology, with rich and rare series, among them a large
number of gold ornaments. The cases here are to some extent better,
but they are closed by padlocks suspended on chains, the appearance
of which is not very pleasing. The gold treasure is inclosed in a
steel fire and burglar proof case, which is especially guarded. In
this museum, too, the policeman plays a great role. A valuable
antique gold ornament, discovered in Ireland in 1896, was purchased
by the British Museum, but is claimed by Ireland.“

Since the art and art-industrial collections of the museum cover all
branches, as in the South Kensington Museum, | can not consider them

properly in a brief space. They are very notable (for example, the
historical portion), but their exhibition offers few individual features.

The ethnographic department, though it has many gaps, is rich in
old South Sea objects, though it is not yet thoroughly arranged. I was
much impressed with the good labeling in some of the cases. The large
type used in printing the labels is conspicuously better than the small
letters almost everywhere in use. They can be read without effort—
not so with the ‘* South Kensington labels,” which are distributed over
the entire country. , This use of large type is well worthy of imitation.
Another arrangement which appealed to me as worthy of adoption is
that in many of the cases there is hung a printed bibliography covering a

indeed is loaned by Trinity College (University), whose ownership,
however, is only a matter of form (Catalogue, 1895, see p. 581). In
this part of the collection are very rare pieces obtained by the Cook

Hall of the Zoological Depariment.

ties; enamels; brass and bronze; iron; Enelish silver; Irish silver;
foreign silver; Leinster collection of postage stamps: Irish antiqui-
ties (bronze tools, gold, early Christian art in Ireland); arms and armor;
carved ivories; copies of works in ivory, bronze, marble; Japanese

‘Neotropical region; Irish animals; injurious insects; general collec-
tion; fossil animals.

Geological and mineralogical departments.—Mineralogical and petro-
logical collections; geological collections; collection of Irish minerals;
collections of geological survey of Ireland.

I have before me the following publications (Department of Agri-
culture and Technical Instruction for Ireland; Institutions of Science
and Art, Dublin):

In the winter of 1900-1901, 22 free lectures were delivered by 14
different gentlemen, admission by card, which were attended by 755
persons, a comparatively small number.

The director of the entire museum is G. T. Plunkett, who is also
director of the Royal College of Science, the Metropolitan School of
Art, the National Library and the Botanical Gardens. Other officers:
Curator of the department of art and industry, Thomas H. Lonegtield;
assistants, J. J. Buckley, EK. P. Alabaster and A..McGoogan; cura
tor of the department of Irish antiquities, G. Coffey; curator of the
natural science department, R. F. Scharff (a German); assistants,
A. R. Nichols, G. H. Carpenter, R. Pride; of the botanical depart-
ment, T. Johnson; of the department of geological survey, R. Clark;
of the mineralogical department, G. A. J. Cole.

The annual expenditure in 1897-98 was $120,000. The administra-
tion appears to be cumbersome; since, for example, in the ethno-
graphic department, authority must be obtained from London (from
the science and art department), for a purchase, even though it
involves but a few pounds. Whether this condition exists in the other
departments, I do not know.

37. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF IRELAND.

The National Library of Ireland is magnificent without, but within is
not up to strict modern library requirements, though the building was
completed only in 1890. The architect, as is so often the case, sacrificed
interior adaptability to exterior appearance. The stack system (five
decks) is made with floor plates of hammered glass and iron, but with
wooden racks. In many places the stacks are so poorly lighted that
electricity must be used even in daytime. The horseshoe-shaped
domed reading room (68 by 65 feet and 52 feet high,) occupies much
space in the middle of the second story. There are three smaller
reading rooms. On either side of the rotunda are the book stacks,
but only those in the right wing are as yet in use. Each is 110 feet
long, 36 feet wide, and 54 feet high, with a capacity of about 200,000
books. The middle one of the five decks of the book stacks is on a
level with the great reading room. In each of these there are 26
double racks, approximately 8 feet high, with an intervening space
of 40 inches, each with 8 or 9 shelves. On the ground or first floor,
in the center, are located, in addition to the broad entrance hall and
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 5838

the great stairway, the administrative offices. Whatever shortcom-
ings this building may have, it hasat all events been carefully thought
out and not erected after the general pattern. It is surpassed, however,
by the new American libraries. I received the impression that they
strive to be successful, but the means at their command are too limited.
Annual reports and catalogues of the annual accessions are published.
The library increases rapidly through donations. It contains at pres-
ent 150,000 volumes. It must be emphasized that the arrangement is
after the Dewey system, this being, perhaps, the only large library in
Europe which employs it. It works excellently, though the books,
on account of the small force of assistants, have no outside markings.
The Dewey classes are distinctly indicated by labels on the stacks and
easily found. Within the classes an alphabetical arrangement is fol-
lowed, and when there are more books than one can conveniently review
ata glance a sequence of the letters is attached to the stacks. The gen-
eral opposition on the part of librarians to the Dewey system is per-
haps based principally on the immense amount of labor involved in
the reassignment and rearrangement of a library, which can not be
undertaken without very considerable means, and then, again, other
systems have also their good points.

It is open from 10 a. m. to 10 p. m. During 1900 there were
148,405 readers.

(See also F. J. Burgoyne, Library Construction, 1897, pp. 153-158,
with ground plans and cross sections, and J. J. Ogle, The Free
Library, 1897, pp. 191-192.)

38. NATIONAL GALLERY.

The National Gallery has just received the addition of a large new
wing, with skylights, and side lights in alcoves; in these the walls are
not at right but at obtuse angles, which is certainly preferable. The
large building makes, by its simplicity, a very favorable impression.
The old portion was constructed during 1859-1864, and cost $150,000.
In 1898 there were on exhibition 464 paintings, 348 drawings, water
colors, etc., 280 portraits, 16 busts, and a collection of casts. It is
open on four week days from 12 to 6 p. m. (or until darkness sets in);
on Sundays from 2 to 5 p. m. (or until dark), admission free; on two
week days it is open from 10 a. m. to 4 p. m., admission sixpence.
(See Catalogue of the pictures and other works of art in the National
Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, Ireland. Dublin, 8vo,
1898, 361 pp.)

39. ANATOMICAL INSTITUTE OF THE UNIVERSITY.

I also visited the anatomical collection, on account of its anthro-
pological department, but as the hall was just being rebuilt and
the cases shoved together, I could see but little. The collection of
584 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

skulls appears to be not unimportant. The director is D. J. Cun-
ningham, professor of anatomy, also well known as an anthropologist.@
The Anatomical Institute is excellently installed, the large dissecting
hall being light, airy, and furnished with the most beautiful dissee-
tions, which here are preferred even to the best colored pictures.

UNIVERSITY (TRINITY COLLEGE. )

The university (Trinity College) consists of an extended group of
buildings beautifully situated in a large park which is quite within
the city. I could not examine it, however, because it would have
consumed more time than I had at my disposal.

XIII.—PARIS.

My remarks may well be somewhat brief, considering the abundance
of matter and the fact that Paris is universally known. I confine
myself to a few notes on my observations.

40. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN THE BOTANICAL GARDEN.
[Muséum d’ Histoire Naturelle au Jardin des Plantes. ]

The majority of the museum halls in the Jardin des Plantes are of
the old-fashioned style, which have been already criticised by J. Mar-
cou in his book, well worth reading, De la Science en France, 1869.
But in 1889 a large, new, zoological museum was completed, which,
as I then saw it, was nearly filled and is now already overcrowded.
Furthermore, there was built three years ago a paleontological, com-
parative anatomical, and anthropological museum, as the first of a
series of new galleries which are to be located adjoining each other on
the Rue de Buffon, the southern boundary of the Garden, their long
sides turned toward the Garden and the street.

ZOOLOGICAL COLLECTION (GALERIES DE ZOOLOGIE).

The Galeries de Zoologie is a large rectangular building, 100 meters
long, 62 to 70 meters wide, and about 25 meters high (without cupola),
with a lighted court 70 meters long, 41 wide, and 20 high, and three
galleries superposed. To say it is a failure is not my judgment alone.
The exterior is in very good taste. The great glass-covered lighted
court was designed by the architect, J. André, as a central space to
be ornamented with plants, and was not intended for the collections.
It is full of large mammals, mounted on too conspicuous wooden
bases—an immense herd, all standing free and some of them impossible
to inspect except at a distance. The entire space of the height of three

as successor to Sir William Turner. The director of the Anatomical Institute in
Dublin is now Prof. J. Symington, formerly in Belfast.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 585

stories from the floor to the glass roof is empty. It would be well
adapted for the large whale skeletons,“ but they are exhibited in the
collection of comparative osteology. Besides, they would detract still
more from the only source of light for the broad encircling galleries,
for these obtain their light only from above. In consequence of this
they, especially the lower ones, are much shaded, being in some
places so dark that nothing can be seen. In the front (Garden) portion
of the building are halls 53 by 10 meters, provided with light from
one side; on the ground floor these are 7 meters high, in the second
story 6, in the third story 5, and in the fourth story, with the roof
work, 7 meters.

In examining this building one can learn, as in many others, how a
museum should not be designed. A few of the special features of the
building have been published by F. Monmory.’ The building cost
$800,000, the fixtures $600,000. Photographs were not obtainable.

The collection is installed in not very pleasing wooden cases, without
greatcare. Inaddition the cases are in some instances overcrowded and
filled to the top, where nothing can be discerned. There is still fol-
lowed here the almost universally abandoned practice of exhibiting
very many stuffed animals, reasoning that people who donate things—
and much is here donated—-wish to see where the objects are placed.
This practice will necessarily have to be discontinued at some time,
even though republican France is more conservative than elsewhere.
The working rooms of the officers and preparators are mostly in a
separate old building, far away in the Rue de Buffon, which is very
inconvenient.

COMPARATIVE ANATOMICAL, ANTHROPOLOGICAL, AND PALEONTOLOGICAL COLLECTION.
[Galeries d’ Anatomie Comparée et d’ Anthropologie. ]

This collection was opened in 1898.° This building also has a taste-
ful exterior of red brick, with light stone trimmings and artistic deco-
ration. On the side facing the garden there are four bronze and
eight marble reliefs, representing human and animal life, by Barrias,
Marqueste, Coutant, and Gardet; in front of these, two statues by
Frémiet. On the narrow side, where the entrance lies, isa tympanum,
by Allar, representing the three kingdoms of nature. The building
is about 86 meters long and 15 and 27 meters wide. It is fireproof,
of iron, stone, brick, and cement. The protection against fire was
considered to such an extent that the workrooms of the staff are located

in an old building in the Rue de Buffon, half a mile away, which is
very annoying, since in the present day complete security can be had
without this inconvenience. Asa further security against fire, elec-
tric lighting is not used. The building with its furniture cost
$625,000. The architect was F. Dutert. In the white entrance hall
with columns there is a marble group by Frémiet, and animals in
relief as capitals, the whole simple, in the refined taste characteristic
of the French. On the right there is a charming little lecture hall
with a ceiling picture by Cormon, The March of the Races of Men
toward Light, and ten pictures illustrating prehistoric times. The
building consists principally of a ground floor, lighted on both sides,
and a second floor, lighted from above, with a gallery. The project-
ing stairway hall is situated at the eastern narrow side, and is of four
stories, with smaller rooms such as the lecture hall already mentioned
and some rooms for collections adjoining. It is surmounted by a high,
arched roof. The large hall on the ground floor (fig. 111) is not parti-
tioned, is somewhat narrow (14 meters inside) compared with its
length of 77 meters, and at the same time its ceiling is somewhat low
(6.6 meters) “ compared with its length, but its effect is excellent and
imposing, and isa modelas to its lighting. As regards the points of the
compass, however, the building is as unfavorably located as possible.
The long sides look toward the north and the south and the collections
are consequently exposed to the sun during the entire day. For this
especial collection it makes naturally very little difference, but the
window shades must be drawn on the south side when the sun shines,
and this bathes everything in a colored light, an error which we
observe in many museums in the world, but which should always be
avoided. The windows begin at a height of 2.6 meters from the floor,
and are 4 meters high, 3 meters wide, the window piers being 1.8
meters wide. ©The cases, which are 2.4 meters high, stand against the
wall under the windows, and therefore receive their light from the
high windows on the opposite side. At the end of the hall on the
narrow side isa gallery. In this large hall the osteological collection
is installed, the larger animals in the center being uncovered—a mag-
nificent view—the others being inclosed in wall cases. These, made
with iron framework but wooden bases, though not answering the

«The height of the halls I could not determine on the spot, but Mr. H. Sinding-
Larsen, an architect of Christiana, had the goodness later to give me these measure-
ments, together with others, without, however, being able to vouch for their
absolute accuracy. In this museum, as in almost all which I visited in Europe and the
United States, it is very difficult to obtain information concerning the buildings, since
the directors, however willing they may be, do not have the data in their possession,
and the administrative and building authorities who have this information can only
be approached by foreigners with great inconvenience and with a great loss of time.
To obtain special information through correspondence is generally very difficult and
often impossible.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 587

strictest claims and not dust proof, are yet good and serviceable,
except that they have too much framework and too small doors. The
installation has been attended to with the greatest care and everything
carried out with a degree of excellence that we seldom find.

In the second floor (fig. 112) the large hall is also not partitioned,
and is 10 meters high to the skylight; and to the galleries, 4.6 meters.
In the open space under the skylight are the large specimens of the

the ground floor, had been arranged as a covered room with light from
both sides, but the architect here, as so often happens, has subordi-
nated the interior uses of the building to its exterior beauty. Light
from above, which is perhaps best for a picture gallery, is not always

well suited for natural history collections. The galleries are, for the
most part, imperfect.

The showy wrought-iron railing, about 250 meters long, which
incases the stairs to the gallery, and the entire railing of the same, is
very obtrusive. It represents large fern leaves and is by itself a piece of
art, but in this place it is too massive, too conspicuous, and consequently
distracting. In the gallery the anthropological collection is installed
(fig. 113) as far as the space allows, comprising the long-famous collec-
tion of skulls, casts, pictures, etc., relating to physical anthropology.
Besides this a prehistoric collection is in adjoining halls, above the
lecture room on the ground floor. This anthropological department
is not quite so elegantly exhibited and labeled as the paleontological
and osteological collection.

It is planned to place the ‘* galerie” which 1s next to be built closely
adjoining, so that the present collections can be extended, and room
be obtained for those portions which belong to this section, which for
lack of space can not now be shown at all, such as the remainder of
the anthropological collection, the whale skeletons, ete. They here
also built too sparingly from the beginning, but were wise, however,
to arrange the new museum so that it can be horizontally enlarged.
The style of architecture does not permit of its being extended ina
vertical direction.

There is a parquet floor, very stylish to look at, but wearisome to
the visitor, since scarcely anyone is accustomed to walking on smooth
parquets without carpets being spread over them.

The new ‘* Galeries d’Anatomie” are, without doubt, a prominent
production in the line of museum technic. They exhibit a rare taste,
and the building closely approaches being a faultless model of its kind.
590 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

It is in a most happy way different from the general pattern. Every-
one who has a museum to build should study carefully this Parisian
one and adopt its good features. This advice can be given with
regard to but very few museums.

Photographs of the exterior were unobtainable.

Tam indebted to Dr. O. Richter, assistant in the Dresden Ethno-
graphic Museum, for the following separate data recorded by him on
his visit in February, 1902:

Ground floor (see fig. 111).—Wooden cabinets, with iron doors without crossbars,
set in wooden frames, the latter, however, only above and below, and laterally at
the end of long rows of cases joined together. Doors with steel frames all approxi-
mate 75 cm. wide. The numbers of the cases are indicated by raised metal figures
on the bottom, inside; color, silver. The shelves are of glass, also the bases for the
installation of individual objects on the shelves, so that glass rests upon glass. The
stands for specimens are of German silver. The rails and brackets are of iron, the
latter secured by screws. The labels are of gray paper or pasteboard in red and black
round hand; the mountings are placed obliquely or horizontally; they are of dark-
blue glass if the objects are light colored. The same applies to alcoholics, in bottles,
presenting a dark-blue background. The closing of alcoholic bottles with tin foil is
obtrusive. The wood of the cases (and horizontal cases, see below), the bases of the
free-standing specimens, the floors and shelves, are uniformly light oak-brown. The
rails and backgrounds of the cases, however, are reddish brown.

Second story.—Here the mountings are also of wood covered with reddish-brown
cloth; stands of brass, not of German silver. Horizontal cases with wooden drawers
below, and narrow metal frames above; no plate-glass pannels, but with crossbars.
The construction is as follows (see figs. 111 and 112): The wooden cases are surmounted
by horizontal glass cases with gold-bronze metal frames on which are tongues for
lifting the covers. The wooden drawers are supplied with massive round, button-
like, wooden handles (two to each ), set in hollowed recesses. A row of these drawers,
situated one above the other, may be locked at the same time, through a general catch,
which is located in the upright between the several rows of drawers.

Gallery.—Anthropological collection (see fig. 113). Skulls on black bases with
four ball-shaped feet. The arrangement is a geographical one: skulls, skeletons
(on light-brown wooden bases of the same form as the skull bases), casts
of types, and illustrations, etc.; illustrations of types arranged also in the shape of
fans. Here the cases have drawers below, as in the horizontal cases already
described. Labels: The general ones black on white and of larger size; special ones in
black on green with green borders:and black on gray with red borders. Casts of
types (Schlagintweit Collection) also in the open, on the wall, in larger groups above
the cases (see fig. 113); these types have the form of medallions. Similar typical
heads in square frames and on gray backgrounds also in the cases. Some of the
skulls are under glass, with light-brown paper strips on the edges.

While in Great Britain and Ireland, as well as in America, the
museums keep open later than they ought, the limitations in this
regard in the collections of the ‘‘Jardin des Plantes” are very marked.
Entrance is more or less beset with difficulties, and it is only by excep-
tion that one can go about without hindrance. While in the former
case they go too far, here, through lack of employees, they do not go
far enough.

The annual expenditure of the Jardin des Plantes (museums, zoo-
logical and botanical gardens), is $200,000.

41. NOTES ON VARIOUS MUSEUMS AND LIBRARIES IN PARIS.
ETHNOGRAPHIC MUSEUM IN THE TROCADERO.

I was compelled to visit this museum twice, since in the absence of
the director I could not obtain access to all its departments on the
occasion of my first visit. Since 1889, when I saw it, it had not
improved in its administration, though it bad increased much in its
possessions. The Asiatic collections have been removed and are now
exhibited only in the Musée Guimet which, since that time, has come
into the possession of the Government. The halls of the Trocadéro
(formerly the Exposition Palace) are not well adapted for this collec-
tion. The cases are of the most primitive kind (mostly old exposition
cases), the method of installation is no less so, consisting in part of
trophies on the walls; the labeling is incomplete and intended more
for the general public. The collection isnot mucheared for, in short,
it has fallen behind the modern museum technic. <A lack of suffi-
cient means is the cause for this. How surprising it is that the
enlightened French Government is so parsimonious in this respect!
Paris, which in many respects surpasses all ought not to retrograde
in the matter of ethnography, but now a great effort would be neces-
sary to bring the collection up to modern standards. The small num-
ber of officials in charge of this rather extensive collection bears no
relation to its present needs; on this account, also, only one of the
various halls is opened at a time, and therefore no adequate publica-
tion of the valuable materials can be made. The annual expenditure
is only $4,500.

; GUIMET MUSEUM (PLACE D’JENA, 1).

This is now a Government collection. This museum I was also com:
pelled to visit twice for the same reason that I did the Trocadéro. On
account of lack of assistants it opens its halls only intermittently, and
in the absence of the director admission can not be had to the closed
portion. The plan of Mr. Guimet, to establish a museum of compara-
tive religions, has been limited to Asiatic religions and extended, on
the other hand, to cover the general ethnography of Asia. In respect
to east Asiatic religions, the museum is over rich and suffers from
lack of space; in view, however, of the difficulty of extending the
already considerable building, it being hemmed in by other structures,
a serious problem is presented—certainly an instructive circumstance
for the consideration of those contemplating the erection of new muse-
ums. Although the building was erected for the purpose, it does
not meet the demands of modern museum construction, either in the
relative position of the several halls to each other, which are influ-
enced by its triangular ground plan, or in respect to lighting, though,
notwithstanding all this, it has many good features. (Photographs
were unobtainable.) I must pass over here the history, the contents,
592 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

and the valuable publications of this most justly famous museum,
as it would lead me too far. Besides, Paris is easily accessible to
everyone and a desirable place to visit. I will only remark that the
exhibit, so far as the contracted space allows, is very good; the label-
ing, however, is so deficient as to oblige one to purchase the guides
and catalogues. The labeling of the ceramic collection is especially
defective, although not in the same degree as in many other museums.
Ground floor: Chinese and Japanese ceramics; Siam and Cambodia.
Second floor: Indian, Chinese, Japanese religions; Indo-China. Third
floor: Japanese paintings; Greek, Roman, and Egyptian antiquities;
Korea. The departments relating to Japanese religions and the other
Japanese collections impressed me as the most noteworthy and as most
thoroughly worked up and labeled. The nephrite collection contains
wonderful specimens. At all events the museum is in its field unex-
celled, though it is capable of improvement as to technical museum
arrangement. Theannual expenditure is $9,500, nothing being allowed
for purchases; Mr. Guimet has thus far himself provided for these in
some cases. The increase in the collections, therefore, depends mostly
on donations.
LOUVRE.

I refer only briefly to the Louvre, which I also visited on two
occasions. The collections are of exaggerated extent. The installa-
tion is in general antiquated and little cared for; the labelling unsatis-
factory. I received the impression that an energetic hand could
improve the existing conditions. It apparently suffers also from lack
of means. While formerly (as late as 1889) umbrellas and canes could
be carried among the collections, they must now be checked (without
charge). The danger of fire in the Louvre is great. The most beau-
tiful is the new Rubens Gallery, opened in 1900, and excellently lighted,
which can not be said of the adjoining Van Dyck hall, also opened in
1900, nor of most of the Louvre halls. The Marine and Ethnographic
Museum on the third floor is in the same defective condition that it
was when I saw it eleven years ago. It is in some respects very rich
in specimens, but it is not scientifically fitted up, and its installation is
as unfavorable as can be imagined. ‘The collection of Japanese and
Chinese porcelains (collection Grandidier), containing about 4,000 spec-
imens, ina poorly lighted half story, is carelessly installed in cases,
and it is entirely undetermined and unlabeled. I saw nothing in the
Louvre in the way of museum construction or technique which would
be worthy of reproduction in a new building. I do not wish, however,
to put myself in the light of one overlooking the importance of the
Louvre among the museums of the world.

GALLIERA MUSEUM.

The Musée de Galliéra is a sumptuous building in the Italian renais-
sance style, by Ginain, in the neighborhood of the Musée Guimet,
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 593

completed about twenty years ago. It is tasteful and grand alike in
its exterior and interior. It contains a municipal art collection. In
view of the fact, however, that this is yet too small to fill the large
building, it is partly occupied also as show rooms for the sale of art
industrial collections. It has magnificent, high, excellently lighted
halls, constituting a monumental structure of a taste and solidity seldom
encountered among modern buildings outside of Paris. It is very
well worth seeing and departs widely from customary museum models.
It is fireproof. A large apparatus for heating by hot air is installed
in the very spacious, light cellars.

NATIONAL LIBRARY.

The National Library gives evidence of the fact that an old library
can also adopt new improvements. About a third of the 2,700,000
volumes “ is installed according to the stack system in five decks, each
2.5 meters high, with passages which admit the light; though all this
is not in so perfect a manner as in the great new American libraries,
yet itanswers the purposes for which it is intended. The reading room
(salle de travail), 43 meters long, 34 wide, and 20 high, by H. Labrouste,
with some 340 seats, is more attractive and more artistically arranged
than that of the British Museum with its 300 seats. The written cata-
logues on the crescent-shaped northern end are easily accessible and
excellent. The printing of the catalogue (alphabetically by authors)
progresses slowly on account of lack of means, the first six volumes of
about 1,200 pages (down to Bancroft) having been completed only
after four years’ labor, according to which it would require sixty
years more to finish the work, though it is expected to accomplish it
in twenty years, as additional means are hoped for. In so wealthy
a country as France it is surprising that so little assistance is given
an undertaking of such general utility. In this respect the British
Museum is unrivaled. (1 tested the manuscript catalogue and found
there, among others, more than twenty of my writings, which speaks in
my eyes for the great comprehensiveness of the library.) The public
reading hall (salle de lecture), on the contrary, is dirty, ugly, and in
the highest degree unattractive; it consists of several rooms. A new
one, however, is about to be constructed. Whenall of the additions to
the libra Ary whieh are in contemplation are completed it will be mag-
nificent. I could only cursorily examine the other rich and celebrated
collections there. Here the installation, partly antiquated, seemed to
me to be historically justified and accommodated to the objects them-
selves. The reading rooms are open from 9a. m. to 4 or 6 p. m., but
not in the evening, differing in this respect from England and America.
The annual expenditure is $162,500, of which, however, only $20,000
may be allotted to the pure thase of books and $20,000 to the pr inting

of the catalogue. I call attention, among other things, to the list of
foreign periodicals, Liste des Périodiques étrangers (2d. ed., 178 pp.,
octavo), published in 1896, containing 4,324 numbers. :

SAINT GENEVIEVE LIBRARY.

The Bibliotheque Ste. Genevieve is an original and beautiful building
(close by the Pantheon, in the neighborhood of the Sorbonne), con-
structed in 1843-1850, by H. Labrouste, and also interesting to me
because the celebrated Public Library in Boston—which I hope to
discuss in detail in a future report—resembles it in its exterior.
The Boston building, however, is a square of 75 meters, with a large
courtyard inclosed by four stories, while the Ste. Genevieve building
is a rectangle 106 meters long, 27 meters wide, with two stories, having
only four windows on the narrow side. It seems to me unjust to speak
of this as a plagiarism, as has sometimes been done. The Paris Library

cost $325,000, the Boston Library, $2,500,000. I include here for com-
parison the fronts of the two buildings (fig. 114 and Plate 40). The
ground plan of the second floor, a cross section, and a side view of
the Ste. Geneviéve Library is given in the Allgemeine Bauzeitung,
1851 (Plate 386); ground plan of the ground floor in the same journal,
1852 (Plate 471). A photograph of the building was not obtainable
in Paris, and I had to have the one which is here published made.
On the ground floor, on the right and left of the somewhat dark‘
entrance hall, is installed the collection of books founded in 1626
(250,000 volumes, as given by one of the librarians), according to-
methods which are not modern, on wooden shelves, the valuable speci-
mens (incunabula, Aldines, etc.) in cabinets. A shallow stair hall,
built on the back in the central portion, measures 2.5 by 9 meters.
The large, very beautiful and noteworthy reading hall, with accommo-
dations for 476 readers, and a comprehensive reference library, is located

in the second story, and has a gallery. It takes in the entire length
and breadth of the building, is 100 meters long, 21 wide, 14 high,
with iron groinings and pillars, and is decorated with objects of art.
It is very homelike. It is open from 10 a. m. to 3 p. m., and from 6
to 10 p. m.; lighted in the evenings by gas, electricity being not used
on account of greater danger (7). The damaging influence of gas
upon the books is overlooked. The total expenses are $23,250, of
which $3,000 are for the purchase of books, $16,000 for salaries, and
$4,250 for administration. An abbreviated catalogue and a catalogue
of the manuscripts (3,500) and first impressions have been published.

I visited also the Pantheon, whose artistic decorations are not effect-
ive on account of poor lighting, and the Sorbonne, which in its new
portions, decorated entirely in white, is very impressive.

There are certainly still many other things in Paris from which I
might have learned something for my special purpose. This would,
however, have required a much longer stay than the few days which
I had at my disposal for investigating some of the many features in
that city of cities.

When one has spent five weeks in large cities of England and is then
immediately transported to Paris, he feels as if he had come upon the
center of a higher civilization. I had that same impression years ago.
This remark relates naturally only to the externalappearances of life, not
to the intrinsic worth of culture, which are the same in England as else-
where. But the lower classes in the large cities of the insular Kingdom
appear poorer and more degraded, their outer bearing more repulsive,
further removed from enlightment and humanity. At all events they
enjoy life less. Compare the enjoyment of life of the French in the
streets of Paris with that of the English in London, Manchester,
Liverpool, Glasgow, etc., and you have a contrast as marked as that
between day and night. If modern civilization under the influence of
trade and manufactures tends to the result which has obtained in Eng-
land, it is surely a regrettable departure, which is practically carrying
us back to barbarism.@

)

a@Dr. T. C. Horsfall, whom I have already mentioned, says on page 3 of a very
readable recent paper, The Use of Pictures in Education, Manchester, 1902: ‘‘ What
will become of England if towns like smoky, unhealthy Manchester continue to grow
as they are now growing? * * * Our big towns already contain a very large and
constantly increasing proportion of the English people, and a great majority of their
inhabitants are living under conditions which make physical, moral, and mental
health impossible. No one who knows what south and east London, Manchester,
and indeed all our large towns are, can resist the conviction that, unless the majority
of our people can soon be got out of such places, or unless the state of the towns is
soon very greatly improved, England, now preeminently the land of cities; can not
long retain her place among great nations. It would be as possible for a great cathe-
dral to escape destruction should walls and columns be rotten, as for a great empire
596 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

The marked difference between the external forms of life in England
and on the Continent results from the fact that the Island Kingdom
has always attended to its own affairs and adhered to its customs and
usages, while the rest of the cultivated world has learned to make life
more beautiful for itself. This exclusiveness has had as a consequence
a remarkable inflexibility in the manner of living, which has been
fully realized by enlightened minds there. So Matthew Arnold (died
1888), one of the most esteemed of modern writers, says that the
English nation has remained hopelessly in the rear in comparison
with the progress of other European peoples, and that what it needs
is not personal freedom, not wealth, industry, and the blessing of
children, but obedience, culture, and refined enjoyment of life. The
Englishman troubles himself even less than a Frenchman concerning
what goes on in the rest of the world. Manufacturing and trade
interests, and the strife for money, in connection with the provision
for so-called domestic ‘* comfort,” which, however, inthe German sense,
is not such, occupy in general the monotonous grind of life from
which it is not decorous to depart. Amusements among the higher
classes are of a dreary sort, and the external circumstances under
which they seek them are often cheerless. As a result of this, the
English often enjoy themselves much more on the Continent than they
do at home. The Englishman, who when abroad is most exacting,
when at home is of a most touching modesty, so that the German in
England appears to be exacting.

I submit these few remarks merely for the purpose of explaining
why it is that travel for study in the large cities of England is not
associated with much pleasure, especially since the enjoyment of the
hospitality, although extended in richest measure to strangers, is
rather a task, both on account of the great distances in the cities and
of the customs of the country, which make ease of intercourse difficult.

to maintain its power, should most of its people be such as the inhabitants of large
parts of London, Birmingham, Glasgow, and Manchester now are. Of the evil con-
ditions affecting the life of the inhabitants of big towns those which receive most atten-
tion are drinking, licentiousness, unwholsome dwellings, smoke-laden air. * * *”

And on page 21: ‘‘ Very little intelligence is needed, for seeing that, if we could
raise the life of our towns to even as high a level as that of Geneva or of any German
or Dutch town, and escape the shame we now feel at the preventable baseness of
English town life, that would be a result which, though it cost him every year half
of his income, would make every well-to-do Englishman ten times richer in all that
is best worth having than the richest man nowis. * * * I greatly fear that
England is destined to fall, a land of starved schools, of playgroundless, treeless cities,
and of well-supported hospitals, reformatories, and lunatic asylums.”’

42, ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY OF BELGIUM.
[Musée Royal a’ Histoire Naturelle de Belgique. }

The Royal Museum of Natural History of Belgium, which has become
famous as regards its contents and management under E. Dupont,

yas ten years ago moved from the interior of the city (Place du Musée)
and installed in a rebuilt monastery in the suburbs, in a high and
somewhat isolated position. This, however, was only done with the
intention of erecting a new building close by. This has now been
undertaken; the house is under roof and will be ready for opening in
a year.” It is immediately adjacent to the present museum, and the
buildings will communicate with each other. It is intended for the

prehistorical, paleontological, zoological, mineralogical, geological,
and botanical collections of Belgium. I regard this new building as
a model of its kind, and while it should not be imitated without modi-
fication, since from the start it has been specially adapted to the col-
lections to be exhibited, yet anyone can with profit adopt some of its
features in constructing a new museum building. Fig. 115 represents
a long side of the half-completed structure, which adjoins the old
building atright angles. It is on rising ground. Fig. 116 represents
the narrow end, with the main entrance and stairway, as well as a
perspective view of the other long side, likewise in a half-completed
condition, and fig. 117 the main hall of the ground floor, half finished.

the center stands the framework of a new case (certainly capable
of improvement). The left half of the hall corresponds with the
long side shown in fig. 116. The orientation of the building appears
to be not without advantage, but I am not fully informed on this point.
The style is simnple and attractive. The exterior is of stone. The slope
of the ground is indicated by three unobtrusive divisions of the facade
into different levels (fig. 115). It is entirely fireproof in construction—
of iron, brick, and cement. The interior decoration will be quite simple
and of uniform color. The building is conspicuous from the very lim-
ited wall sufaces, consisting, as it does, almost entirely of broad windows
with but little space between (fig.115). The entire ground floor consti-
tutes one large undivided hall (fig. 117), with windows on both sides, and,

as it was feared that it would not be possible to provide sufficient light
from the sides on the right and left, one longitudinal half of the hall
is, In addition, supplied with skylights, there being no stories above.
This large hall has double windows, contrary to the custom in most
museums, as it was thought that otherwise the room could not be suf-
ficiently heated on account of its great amount of window surface. I
think this fear is without foundation; but if the cost is to be disregarded
it is manifestly better so—at all events, for the purpose of keeping
out the dust, in case the new method of ventilation is not adopted.
(See Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool above.) This is not con-
templated, as the system was unknown here, and the steam heating
apparatus is already installed. The second and third floors cover
only one longitudinal half of the building (fig. 115). The third story

STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 599

is devoted to the collections; the second—practically only an interme-
diate story—is allotted to many workrooms, which all adjoin one
another. Such an excellent arrangement is seldom found in any other
large museum.

In the basement, separated by a corridor 6 meters wide, are located
the preparators’ quarters and storerooms, the first well lighted, the
second not so well, but to be provided with electric lights. The whole
length is 84.26 meters, the width 30 meters. There is one preparators’
room 24.8 meters long and 15 meters wide, and three, each 18.6 meters
long and 15 meters wide. Corresponding to these are four storerooms,
each 7 meters wide. The height of the basement rooms is 4.5 meters;

the portion under the gallery of the ground-floor hall, 5 and 7 meters.

Fra. 117.—Royal Museum of Natural History, Brussels, Belgium. Large lower hall.

The large hall on the ground floor (to be devoted to the recent and fossil
vertebrate animals of Belgium and its colonies) is 84.26 meters long,
30 meters wide, and 7.2 meters high. It will, however, be lengthened
by 18 meters, so that the entire length of the building with the stair-
way hall in front will be 109 meters. The ceiling of this hall, in its
entire width of 30 meters, is supported only by a central row of iron
columns, of which there are 13, spaced 6.2 meters apart. Each half
of the hall has, consequently, a clear, unobstructed width of 15 meters
for the use of the collections—a width which, without columns, has
been made use of in but few museums before the present day. Even
permitting, as is proved in this instance, a superstructure of stories,“

aThe breadth of the hall in the Paris Anatomical Museum is 14 meters, without
supporting columns.
600 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

museum halls of such a width ought not to be obstructed ky columns,
as is universally the case. On the window side of the half with a
double-glass roof there is a gallery 3.25 meters broad (in its first sec-
tion still broader), intended for the cave finds, as well as for the living
and fossil fishes of Belgium and its colonies. A similar gallery runs
along the rear narrow side of the hall. The four sections of the floor
and ceiling, which are of different elevations, are 24.8, 18.6, 18.6, and
21.8 meters long. In the second (intermediate) story are located for a
length of 91.3 meters and a width of 15 meters, besides a stairway, hall,
and two office rooms, 11 workrooms adjoining one another, each 9.8
meters long, 6.2 meters wide, and 4.75 meters high. At the rear end
there are three library rooms of the same dimensions. In front of
these rooms there is a corridor 3 meters wide and 3 meters high, from
which anterooms (without windows) 2.2 meters wide and 3 meters
high lead into the workrooms. In the third story, again, there is an
exhibition hall 84.26 meters long and 15 meters wide, for the recent and
fossil invertebrate animals, the fossil floras, the minerals, and precious
stones of Belgium and its colonies. It has five different elevations,
rising like steps, and on each level horizontal cases underneath are
intended. Therefore there are about 400 running meters of horizontal
cases in five series, rising one above the other, with longitudinal pas-
sages and crossways between, the latter with stairs. The ascending
of this hall afforded sufficient extra space in the second (intermedi-
ate) story for workrooms. Its lighting is excellent; the long side at
the foot of the step-like installation of horizontal cases is one com-
bined glass window (glass partition wall). In addition, a row of upper
windows on the opposite half of the roof throws light directly on these
horizontal cases. The height of this hall varies between 2 and 7
meters, being 2 meters at the top and 7 meters at the foot of the step-
like construction.

A better utilization of the space is hardly imaginable, and what
should be particularly noticed is the fact that no superfluous space (nor
likewise money) is expended on the stair hall, as is the case in most
museums. This stair hall is built in front and not inside of the build-
ing, and is only 17 meters long and 7.1 meters deep. ach story is
directly connected with the old museum.

Ido not go into further detail on account of the unfinished condi-
tion of the building, but I would advise every architect who has a
museum to design to scrutinize closely that of Brussels. It is a
departure from every other structure of its kind because it is adapted
to the original exhibition plan of the director. Mr. E. Dupont has
throughout his entire life had in view the establishment of a Belgian
national museum based on the researches that have been made in
that country, so taking the national collections as a nucleus for this,

the world being utilized only so far as they are necessary to a proper
understanding of this nucleus. With this in mind he has comprehen-
sively arranged the researches according to a definite plan, and has
recently included the Kongo State as Belgian. He regards the work-
ing up of the collections as a less important function of a museum
than the procurement of the materials, in which latter respect he has
been very successful, as is evidenced by the famous Iguanodons 8
meters high, 10 meters long, the fossil crocodiles, tortoises, sharks,
whales, elephants, giant deer, rhinoceroses, ete. All of these, in
addition to the extensive cave finds, will be installed in an intelligent
way in the basement hall. In the rear portion of the hall of 84 meters
length a herd of Iguanodons will be installed in many different posi-
tions, for which purpose the model is already prepared. Asa parallel
representation of animals now living, there will be shown a herd of
elephants from the Kongo. The different elevations in the hall, rising
by steps, will be utilized for separating the different epochs of the
earth’s history and the general view of the installation in this immense
space promises to be most magnificent, provided it is not detracted
from by the cases.

In view of the -fact that the staff of seven museum experts must
divide its time between exploring tours and the conduct of the museum,
the assistance of outside experts, who are paid $5 a day and travel
ing expenses, is obtained to identify and work up the collections.
For this same purpose many specimens are sent out of the museum to
receive attention. Scarcely any other natural history museum in the
world is so uniformly planned and managed, but Mr. Dupont has been
successful only after withstanding the greatest opposition and battling
for decades. He insisted so firmly upon his well-considered plans that
at one time for a year and a half his authority as director of the
museum was suspended because he would not submit to the regulations
promulgated by the minister. Finally, however, he carried his point.
He also had a desperate struggle to reserve to himself the choice of
the architect, who has constructed the museum entirely in accordance
with his own personal directions. The cost of the building has been
estimated at $215,000, the cases, etc., $40,000—remarkably small sums
compared with the cost of construction of other museums.

The rooms of the old museum will later be used for the non-Belgian
portions of the collections, but since they are manifestly not suited for
museum purposes, the erection of a second new building is even now con-
templated, for which purpose—which is of the greatest importance in
the development of every museum—an abundance of space is available
on the museum grounds. Little, however, can be said in praise of the
present museum. ‘The reconstruction of the monastery could have
been better arranged so far as regards the lighting. The cases are
those of the old museum, not answering modern requirements. ‘The
602 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

installation is as a whole not attractive, but in many details worth
imitating. The charts of geographical distribution, now found in
many museums in the world, emanated from Brussels and have been
elaborated here more than anywhere else. Especially noteworthy is
the labeling and a large series of long descriptive and instructive
placards. The minister at one time instructed the director to arrange
for lectures in the museum for the benefit of the visiting public; the
latter determined, however, to give these in the form of information
on labels, arguing that in this way the information could be dissemi-
nated much more widely.

In this retired location the museum is visited annually by 80,000
persons; in the city formerly by 150,000. It is opened daily from 10
a.m. to 3 or 4p. m., according to the time of the year—in my judg-
ment, much too long a time for preserving the colors of the specimens.

For the prevention of fire, extinguishers are everywhere installed,
known as the Extincteur Instantané, Systeme Ad. Vandrooghenbroeck,
Molenbeek-Bruxelles.

The annual expenditures amount to $31,750. Publications are
issued as follows: Annales (10 volumes in folio up to 1896), Bulletins
(7 volumes in octavo up to 1888), and Mémoires (since 1900 one volume
in quarto).

It is not easy in a brief space to do justice to this original and
uniquely organized museum.

43. BRIEF NOTES ON VARIOUS COLLECTIONS AND. BUILDINGS.

I also visited in Brussels the House of the People (Maison du
Peuple), designed by Horta, a remarkable, large, modern structure
(completed in 1899) for the recreation and instruction of the working
people, erected by themselves at a cost of $160,000 and utilized also as
a socialistic sales house. It is entirely modern in style, fireproof, and
especially noteworthy on account of the interior iron construction of
a hall, which accommodates 3,000 persons, used for assemblies, lec-
tures, as a theater, and for concerts. It is artistically embellished,
not in the style of a railway station, as is found in many museums—as,
for instance, in the older part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York, in the museums of Science and Art in Dublin and Edin-
burgh, and in the Natural History Museum of London, etc. Architects
who build museums should inspect this hall.

The Royal Museum of Modern Painting (Musée Royal de Peinture
moderne) is open daily from 10 a. m. to 3, 4, or 5 p. m., according to
the time of the year. Its lighting is insufficient, as In many picture
galleries. The great number of watchmen who were sleeping or
entertaining themselves was noticeable, as also the marked lack of
visitors.
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 603

The great Royal Museum of Ancient Paintings and of Sculpture
(Musée Royal de Peinture ancienne et de Sculpture) made an excellent
impression on me, with the exception that the halls are not well cared
for.

I did not at this time examine any other institutions in Brussels,
partly because they were already well known to me and partly because
they were said not to be very important, as in the case of the Congo
Museum in the somewhat distant Tervueren.

XV.—HANOVER.
44, PROVINCIAL MUSEUM.

The Provincial Museum is a new, rather large, and isolated museum,
near a park, for which a public competition had taken place in 1896. It
was not quite completed in October, 1901, but opened in February, 1902.
It was constructed between 1897 and 1902 by H. Stier, in a modified,
Italian high renaissance style, at a cost of more than $500,000. The
city contributed the site and $137,500. It forms a rectangle 82 meters
long and 61 meters wide, with its main front facing the southwest, the
most favorable orientation for a building practically square; other-
wise it is better to have the narrow sides face the south and the north.
For this purpose the triangular site which was available, the main
front being placed along its hypothenuse, would have been utilized to
the best advantage if the right perpendicular (Plank street) had been
taken as the principal axis. In this case, then, the form of the build-
ing would not have been shaped after general architectural principles,
but only with regard to the collections to be housed. The three-
storied building incloses a courtyard measuring 48 by 28 meters. The
average width of the wings is 16 meters; the ground-floor story is 3.6
meters high; the second story 5.9, and the third story 6.5. On the
ground floor and the second story there is throughout light from both
sides (see ground plan of the latter floor in fig. 143); in the third story
there are 11 rooms with light from one side and 11 rooms with sky-
light. The total height from the street level to the cornices, 16.2
meters; the four pavilions on the corners extending 4.45 meters above
this, and the rotunda still 28.8 higher. The entrance hall on the
eround floor is 9.5 high and 16 meters square with a branching stair-
way to the second story, where again there is a large hall (with cupola)
16 meters square—the main hall of the museum.

The building is of fireproof construction throughout, except the
cupola, which is of wood (for economy’s sake). The roofs, however,
are covered with copper sheets with iron bands and purlins. The
exterior walls are of sandstone and tufa, with granite water tables; the
carved ornamentation of the main front is of limestone; the sides facing
the courtyard are cemented and painted with amphiboline color, and the
604 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

cornice and window sills are of sandstone. For the interior cast-iron
columns and beams are employed, covered throughout with terra
cotta and siliceous marl. The floor is made of xylopal (sawdust with
white cement), supplied by Kithl & Miethe, in Hamburg, which is
applied moist upon the surface of a concrete foundation; it has a
yellow tint and is elastic. In both halls and in some of the other
rooms terrazzo combined with linoleum is employed. As shown in
fig. 120, which represents a room in the second story, the interior
decoration is simple except for the capitals, ete., which are more richly
ornamented; ceilings and walls painted with light lime color. There
is steam heating and no ventilating apparatus.

The building cost $6.50 for each cubic meter of built space; the
foundation, $54,500, or $13.50 for each square meter, there being

approximately 3,900 square meters. The new fixtures cost $14,000.

Fic. 118.—Provincial Museum, Hanover, Germany.

I take these details from the readable and comprehensive description
by the architect in the Zeitschrift fiir Architektur und Ingenieurwesen,
1902, Part I, 18 half pages, with four plates and five text figures,
quarto.

For a provincial museum this is a most noticeable work and much
may be learned from it. The building had to serve for collections of
all kinds, for art and science, ecclesiastical antiquities, medizval art
objects, sculptures, paintings, coins, ethnography, archeology, zoology,
paleontology, botany, mineralogy, etc., and contains also as a con-
spicuous exhibit the so-called ‘‘Guelph” museum, which is held in
trust by the joint house of Brunswick-Liineburg. It was necessary in
designing the building to make it meet the most varied needs, and on
that account the architect imitated famous models, avoiding, however,
above all things, insuflicient lighting, which is so often found. All

the rooms are light except the basement, which was properly not
intended for collections, but which, on account of the necessity for
abridging the original plans, for reasons of economy, had to be devoted
to this purpose. Thus the ethnographic and prehistoric collection
there exhibited is quite inadequately lighted. Only on the southeast
and southwest sides may disadvantages arise from too much sun. The
partition of the third story into 22 small rooms is not altogether advan-
tageous, the natural sciences being crowded thereby. In addition, in
this department, for economical reasons, old cases were used as well
as new ones made after an entirely antiquated pattern, although good
examples were at hand nearby in the collections of the veterinary

high school. The columns and beams of the second story are not
adapted to the dimensions of the rooms and look heavy. Whether the
columns could not have been omitted altogether in rooms of this lim-
ited width is a question well worthy of consideration. In the Brussels
Museum we learned of a hall 30 meters wide with only one row of
columns in the center (see above), a span, therefore, of 15 meters, while
the rooms of this provincial museum are only 14 to 15 meters wide.“

As fig. 118 shows, much money has been spent in the artistic
exterior decoration of the building, and not less for its two large halls,

«The ground-floor hall in the Galeries d’Anatomie in the Botanical Gardens in
Paris also has a width of span of 14 meters without columns.
606. REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

on whicn account it was necessary to make the building smaller than
was originally planned and demanded by the extent of the collections,
therefore it became impossible to install the natural science collections
according to modern requirements. Besides, the form of the entire
structure admits of no extension. Though the building is only just
completed, the builder already calls attention, in his description,
to the fact that the natural-history collections must have a separate
building! No provision has been made for the introduction of dust-
free air into the museum, therefore the most recent important
improvements in this direction have not been considered. As the
museum, when I inspected it, was not entirely completed, I am not in

a position to express a final opinion regarding it, though I believe that
here, in conjunction with some undesirable features, much that is
good is to be found.

45. VETERINARY HIGH SCHOOL: TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL.

The Veterinary High School (Tierirztliche Hochschule) is a large,
only recently completed building in a group of single houses. The
annual expenditures are $32,500. There are about 300 students and
17 teachers. I confined my attention to the anatomical institute, where
there is a museum which is good but offers nothing extraordinary, as
there was only a limited sum available for the building and as there
STUDIES ON MUSEUMS AND KINDRED INSTITUTIONS. 607

likewise is for its maintenance. In the large, light, clean dissecting
hall is such an effective ventilating apparatus that when it is set in
operation, as required, it obviates all odors. The iron cases contain-
ing the collection, located in well-lighted halls, are of the Dresden
pattern, although not of the most improved type.

The Technical High School (annual expenditure $125,000), whose
mineralogical collection I visited, possessed nothing worthy of men-
tion from a technical-museum standpoint.

CONCLUSION.

In reviewing all these experiences of travel—to make clear what
there was new to learn, independent of old and well-known matters,
especially in connection with the building of a new museum in Dres-
den—I note particularly two things that deserve especial mention:

(1) The new ventilating and heating methods employed. in the
museums of Liverpool and Glasgow, originating contemporaneously
though independently of each other, and also installed in the technical
schools in Manchester and Liverpool, as well as in the Rylands Library
in Manchester, elsewhere in use only in America—has hitherto been
entirely disregarded in Germany, so far as I know; and

(2) The plan of construction of the new Brussels Natural History
Museum, which, being accurately adapted to certain special purposes,
ought not to be copied without modifications, is very instructive and
worthy of imitation as respects its lighting and utilization of space,
and also as regards its low cost, which has not, however, been allowed
to detract from its pleasing effect. It, therefore, appears to be most
noteworthy.

In general, notwithstanding the shortcomings that attach to most
human things, the Natural History Museum and the Museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons in London remain in many respects at the
head as models in the line of technic of natural science museums and in
the scientific usefulness of the collections. There is probably no
museum official who has not learned more in those museums than every-
where else. The method of installation in the Ethnographic Museum
in Oxford is unique in its way, and in a high degree suggestive and
instructive. The Rylands Library, in Manchester, remains, notwith-
standing its many shortcomings as a library building, a magnificent
jewel box. Finally, the Galeries d’Anatomie in the Jardin des Plantes
in Paris is a most remarkable production, not only as a museum
structure, but also as an example of the art of exhibition, particularly
the ground floor, on account of its excellent lighting and the simplicity
of its plan.

Although I particularize in these several respects in concluding this
paper, I do not wish to cast in the background the many other good
things that I have already mentioned in their place and for which I

608 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1903.

refer the kind reader to the several chapters. On the other hand, not:
withstanding all the good that I saw, the opinion forces itself upon
me—and I do not wish to conceal it—that, taken as a whole, the art of
constructing natural science museums is still in its infancy. In most
‘ases such museums are defectively planned, and it is only exception-
ally that we meet with beginnings that may be considered as the dawn
of a new era in this field of human endeavor. Then, too, the art of the
interior installation of such museums is, in general, still in a very bad
state. The principal reasons for this appear to me to be that, on the
one hand, whatever is displayed in a prominent locality is imitated
without judgment and without wishing at all to better it, and on the
other hand, attempts are made quite independently, without any effort
to profit by the experience of others in such matters. In most cases,
also, plans for natural science museums are carried out too rapidly.
A new building is determined upon, money is available for its con-
struction, and then sufficient time is not devoted to properly prepar-
ing the plans in advance—presently a plan is selected and all of
its shortcomings must be taken with it. With regard to the interior
furnishing, however, the conditions are still worse. Usually the build-
ing has cost more money than was anticipated and economy must then
be exercised in the interior furnishing. Although this is no less essen-
tial, yet much too little importance is attached nearly everywhere to
the interior installations, and far too slight deliberation is bestowed
upon them.

I am convinced that the natural science museum of the distant
future will be very different from that of the present, often very
inadequate, attempts. On the other hand, art museums have already
advanced to a much higher stage of progress, due perhaps to the fact
that their contents are not so varied and that consequently the problems
to be solved do not present such difficulties.
